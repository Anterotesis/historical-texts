            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a Conclusion of our
religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> worthy to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered:
That Christ
alone is our Mediator,
Iustifier, Propitiatour,
Sauiour, by workes and
merits which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
wrought within himselfe, and not by
any works or merits which he worketh in vs
by his spirit. The scripture saith thus much
in expresse wordes. <hi>Iustified freely by the
rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ption</hi> THAT IS IN CHRIST
IESVS. Ro. 3. 24. <hi>He hath by</hi> HIM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SELFE
<hi>purged our sinnes.</hi> Hebr. 1. 3.
<hi>He was made sinne for vs that we
should be made the righteousnesse of
God</hi> IN HIM. 2. Cor. 5. 21. IN
HIM <hi>are yee complete.</hi> Coloss. 3. 10.
<hi>By his</hi> OWNE BLOOD <hi>he entred
once into the holy place, and obtained
<pb facs="tcp:3595:3"/>
eternall redemption.</hi> Heb. 9. 12. Againe
Christ is said to <hi>purge our consciences
from dead workes by his blood:</hi> because
he <hi>offered himselfe by his eternall spirit
without spot to his father.</hi> v. 14. And co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
reason tels vs as much. For if men be
mystically vnited to Christ, and by this vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
receiue the spirit of Christ, and by the
spirit doe good workes, and consequently
merit eternal life, they are the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> becom part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
with Christ, and are receiued into fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship
with him in the worke of mans re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption:
whereas he in the Act of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
with God, admits neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putie
nor partner.</p>
            <p>This conclusion beeing thus of infallible
trueth, it serues greatly to exalt the grace
of God, to abase nature, and to beate downe
the pride of all Iustitiarie persons and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions.
And for the further explaning of
it, serues this Treatise following: which I
present to your Worship. And the reason of
my doing is this. I remember, almost two
yeares agoe, in speech you entred into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s

that some thing might be set downe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

you might be brought to a further vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding

a short exposition of it. And I haue
further presumed to publish it in your name
desiring it may be a testimonie of a thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

of God, I take my leaue. <hi>Anno. 1601.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE scope of these
words, is this. In the
second ver. Paul ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monisheth
the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians
to take heed
of certaine counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit.
Apostles which
ioyned Christ and circumcision in the
cause of their saluation: and put confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in the flesh, that is, in the outward
works of the ceremoniall &amp; morall law.
And that his Admonition might take
the better place, he vseth two reasons.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:3595:5"/>
The first propounded in the 3. v. is this;
True circumcision is to worship God
in spirit, to reioyce in Christ, and not to
put any confidence in the flesh. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
reason is framed thus. If any man
might put confide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in outward things,
then I much more: but not I: therefore
no man. The proposition or first part
of the reason is propounded in the 4. v.
and confirmed in the fift and sixt. The
second part, or, assumption [but I doe
not put confidence in outward things]
is confirmed in the 7. and eight verses,
thus: All things are losse to me in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of Christ: therefore I put no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in any thing out of Christ.
And this is the very drift of the former
wordes.</p>
            <p>In the second place the proper sense
and meaning of this portion of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is to be considered. And for this
cause, we are to be aduertised of sundrie
things in the wordes themselues. And
first of all, let it be obserued, that Paul
in the 7. v. saith, in the time past, <hi>I haue
counted all things losse:</hi> and in the next
verse, in the time present, <hi>I doe count all
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:3595:5"/>
things losse.</hi> The former speach is meant
of that time in which he was first called
to the knowledge of Christ: the second
is spoken of the time, when he had long
continued an Apostle of Christ, and
writte this epistle to the Philippians.
This distinction of times in one and the
same word, makes much to the cleering
of the doctrine, that shall afterward be
deliuered. Secondly, whereas in our
translation, it is saide in the eight verse,
<hi>For whome I haue counted all things losse,</hi>
the words are too skant, and do not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
expresse the meaning of the holy
Ghost. For the words fully translated,
signifie, <hi>I haue made all things losse, or, I
haue cast away all things,</hi> or, <hi>I haue depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
my selfe of all things for Christ.</hi> And
whereas Paul had said before, <hi>[I count
all things losse,]</hi> his meaning is to ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
his owne words, by saying, <hi>I depriue
my selfe of all things, and iudge them dunge
for Christ.</hi> Thirdly, the word translated
<hi>[Doung]</hi> signifieth such things in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tralls
of beasts, as beeing vnfit for mans
vse, are cast to dogges: and by it Paul
signifies, that he did not onely esteeme
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:3595:6"/>
all things as losses, and depriue himselfe
of them, but also cast them away with
loathing, in a minde neuer to seeke the
recouerie of them. Lastly, it must be
knowne, that Paul in these verses vseth
a similitude borrowed from the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
man; and it may be framed on
this manner. The marchant in hope of
a treasure, is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent to esteeme his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
no commodities but losses; yea
he is further content to cast them out
into the sea, and to esteeme the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as things
cast to dogges, that he may obtaine his
intended treasure: so, saith Paul, doe I
count all my former prerogatiues as
losse, and am content to depriue my
selfe of them, yea to loath them as dung,
for the obtaining of Christ.</p>
            <p>Furthermore the summe and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the wordes, is a comparison of
things vnequall, and it may be formed
thus: All things are losse to me for
Christ: and Christ is my gaine. The
first part of the comparison is of Pauls
losses, and it is amplified two waies.
First he sets downe, what things be his
losse: and they are of two sorts. Priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:3595:6"/>
vertues, and workes before his
conuersion when he was a Pharisie: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
priuiledges, vertues, and workes
after his conuersion when he was an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
of Christ: the first are mentioned
in the 7. v. the latter in the eight. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
Paul sets downe, how all things
are losses to him by a gradation, thus: <hi>I
count all things losse: I depriue my selfe of
them: I count them dung.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second part of the comparison
is of Pauls Gaine. And it is amplified
by a contrarie gradation, thus: <hi>I esteeme
the knowledge of Christ an excellent thing:
I desire to gaine Christ: and I desire to be
found in him.</hi> Of these points in order:
and first of Pauls losses before his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion,
in these words:
<q>For the things that were vantage to me,
I counted losse for Christ.</q>
That these things may be well knowne,
let vs yet more narrowly search the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of these wordes. The things that
were vantage to Paul are of three sorts.
First his priuiledges, that he was borne
a Iewe, that is, a member of the church:
and againe, that he was circumcised and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:3595:7"/>
brought vp in the straight sect of the
Pharisies: secondly his vertues, namely
his iustice &amp; zeale in his religion: third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
his workes, whereby he for outward
carriage obserued the Ceremoniall and
Morall law without reproofe. And all
these things are called his aduantage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he put his confidence in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and
thought to merit euerlasting life there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
when he was a Pharisie. He addes
further, that he counted these his aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
to be his losse; because so soone as
he knew Christ, his confidence ceased,
his former merits were no merits, but as
things lost and cast away: yet not sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
but for Christ, that is, that he might
gaine Christ, and be found in Christ, as
he expounds himselfe in the words fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
            <p>The meaning thus laide downe, sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie
things may be learned. The first,
that it was an heresie of the Pharisies,
to put confidence in their works, &amp; to
think that they could merite eternal life
by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for here Paul saith, that being a
pharisie, his workes were his gaine and
aduantage in the cause of his saluation.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:3595:7"/>
And hence we learne, what to iudge of
the popish religion, which teacheth in
substance the very same doctrine of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in workes, and of the merit of
saluation thereby. And therefore the
papists of our time are the children
of the old pharisies, reuiuing and renu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the old heresie touching merit, with
new and fresh colours. If they alleadge,
that they ascribe merit to the works not
of the ceremoniall but of the morall
law, and to workes not of nature but of
grace; I answer, that the pharisies did
the same, as the pharisie acknowledgeth
in his praier, when he saith, <hi>I thanke thee,
O Lord, I am not as other men, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly in Pauls example beeing a
Pharisie, we learne, that it is the pride &amp;
arrogancie of mans nature, to be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
within himselfe, and to erect vp
something vnto himselfe to be his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse
and a meanes of his saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
out of Christ. <hi>The iust</hi> (saith Haba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuk)
<hi>liues by his faith,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hab. 2. 4.</note> 
               <hi>but he whose soule is
not right in him, puffes vp himselfe,</hi> or
builds towers of defence to himselfe by
vaine confidence out of God. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:3595:8"/>
sonne must haue his part alone
by himselfe from his father. Paul saith of
the Iewes,<note place="margin">Ro<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 10. 3.</note> that they established their
owne righteousnesse, and would not be
subiect to the righteousnesse of God.
This beeing so, let vs learne to see and
detest this pride in our selues. For
where it raignes and takes place, there
Christ is not truely acknowledged: and
when men beginne to knowe Christ,
this hidden and spirituall pride giues
place. And further by this, we learne
not to maruell, that Turkes and Iewes
denie Christ, and that Papists in the
cause of their saluation, beside the passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Christ, foiste in something of their
owne, namely their owne merits and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions:
for it is the proude nature of
man to set vp himself in whole or in part,
and to relie himselfe vpon something of
his own out of Christ. No maruell then,
that such as be otherwise learned and
wise, liue &amp; die in the opinion of iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
by their owne workes.</p>
            <p>Thirdly whereas Paul accompts
things of aduantage to be his losse, we
learne that no priuiledges out of Christ
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:3595:8"/>
minister true comfort or true happines.
It is a priuiledge to haue known Christ
and to haue eaten &amp; drunken with him:
but of such Christ saith,<note place="margin">Luk. 13. 16.</note> 
               <hi>Depart from me,
I knowe you not.</hi> It is a priuiledge to be of
the kindred of our Sauiour Christ, but
it is of no moment:<note place="margin">Mar. 2. 35.</note> for Christ saith, <hi>Who
is my mother and brethren? he that doth the
will of my father, is my brother, sister, and
mother.</hi> It is a priuiledge that the virgin
Mary was the mother of Christ: but if
shee had not as well borne him in her
heart by faith as shee bare him in her
wombe, shee had not bin saued. It is a
priuiledge to prophesie in the name of
Christ,<note place="margin">Math. 7.</note> but of such Christ saith, <hi>Depart
from me ye workers of iniquitie.</hi> Lastly it
is a priuiledge to be indued with all
kind of learning, of artes, and tongues;
but alas, all is nothing: for if a man had
al wit, wisdome, and learning, and could
speake in all matters with the tongue of
men and angels, vnlesse he be found in
Christ, he is no better in the sight of god
then a damned wretch. This being so,
we must learne first of all, to moderate
our care and our affections for worldly
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:3595:9"/>
profits, honours, pleasures, &amp; our prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
care must euermore be cast on
Christ. Secondly, such persons as liue
an honest and ciuill life, and stand vpon
this, that they are no theiues, no murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
no adulterers, no blasphemers, but
in outward duties shewe loue to God
and man, they must I say, take heed, least
they deceiue themselues, building vpon
false groundes. For though ciuill hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
be a thing commendable before
men, yet is it not sufficient to saue vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God. And Paul, who was a straite
obseruer of the lawe, after he came to the
knowledge of Christ counted all his
morall obedience, in which he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
trusted, but losse and dungue for
Christ.</p>
            <p>Fourthly it hath bin the doctrine of
the popish Church this many yeres, that
before a man can be in Christ and be
iustified, he must first of all prepare and
dispose himselfe to receiue his iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
and that when he is sufficiently di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposed,
he doth merit of congruitie that
god should infuse righteousnes, wherby
of a sinner he is made no sinner &amp; righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:3595:9"/>
before God. But I demaund of the
Patrons of this doctrine; whether, when
the workes of preparation are done, the
doer is in Christ or out of Christ? If he
be in Christ, he is also iustified before he
is iustified. If he be as yet out of Christ,
Paul hath giuen the sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce that the said
workes are to be esteemed as losse, and
that the merit of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gruitie is not meate
for them that desire to feede on Christ,
but rather food for dogges.</p>
            <p>Lastly hence we learne, howe Christ
is to be receiued of vs. Such as would
truely come to Christ and receiue him,
must make losses of al things: they must
come naked and emptied of all their
owne righteousnesse. As men in a ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke
cast out their commodities, and
when there is no remedie leaue their
ship and betake themselues to the sea, &amp;
thus come swimming to the shore: euen
so must all men first forsake all, &amp; then
come to Christ. Beggars, that they may
obtaine their almes, come in their rag<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
vnfolding legges and armes, that their
sores and botches may be seene. Bena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dad
king of Syria, that he might recouer
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:3595:10"/>
the fauour of the king of Israel, castes
off his crowne and royall robes: he and
his men come in sackcloath with halters
about their heads: and thus he obtaines
his desire. In like manner comming to
Christ, we must lay aside all opinion of
our owne goodnesse, and in abasing of
our selues follow beggars fashions, and
with Benhadad cloath our selues with
signes of guiltinesse and confusion of
face. We must first be annihilated and
vtterly in respect of goodnesse be made
nothing in our selues, that we may be
what we are out of our selues in Christ.
There is no entring into the kingdome
of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, except we receiue it &amp; Christ
as a little child in all meeknesse and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie.
For there must be nothing in vs
to receiue Christ, but meere faith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
on meere mercy. Let all such think
on this, as desire to be in Christ, and to
receiue true comfort by him.</p>
            <p>Thus much of Pauls losses before
his conuersion: nowe come to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
the things which were his losses
after his conuersion: and they are set
downe in the words following, But,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:3595:10"/>
               <hi>[doubtlesse I doe thinke all things losses for
the excellent knowledge of Iesus Christ my
Lord.]</hi> That these losses may be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
knowne, let vs a little consider the
meaning of the words. Whereas before
Paul had said, that herefore he counted
things to be losse vnto him for Christ,
that had beene his aduantage: some man
might happily thinke, this is but rash
iudgem<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nt in Paul; he therefore, to cut
off this surmise saith, <hi>Daubtlesse I count
all things losse,</hi> that is, that I may not be
thought to speake rashly, I say more,
that I doe nowe account all things losse,
and I speake it confidently, as beeing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued
what I say. When he saith, <hi>I doe
count,</hi> he speakes in the time present of
himselfe as beeing not only a Christian
but also an Apostle of Christ. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
he saith, <hi>ALL things,</hi> the generall
speech must be obserued, for he excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
nothing pertaining to him, but his
knowledge and faith in Christ. Here
therefore we must first of all vnderstand
the priuiledge of an Apostle: secondly
all inward &amp; Christian vertues, as hope,
feare, loue of God, good conscience,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:3595:11"/>
&amp;c. for of al the inward gifts none is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
but faith (as I haue said.) Thirdly
here we must vnderstand works not of
nature but of grace, done and effected
by the spirit of God in vs. For in the
verse following he doth reiect his owne
righteousnes which is of the law. Now
he saith of all these, that they are his los<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
for Christ. But how are they losses?
The speach must warily be vnderstood,
least it be offensiue. They are losses not
in respect of godly conuersation: for
they are the causes thereof, and they are
meanes of shewing our thankfulnes to
God and loue to man. Now then they
are losses onely in respect of iustificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and saluation: when they are repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and maintained as meritorious cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
thereof either in whole or in part.
Though, when they are rightly vsed &amp;
applied, they are the excellent gifts of
God: yet when they are brought into
the Acte of iustification and saluation,
they become as losses and dung. And
this I take to be the meaning of these
words. To the like purpose the prophet
Isai saith in the name of the whole
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:3595:11"/>
church confessing hir sinnes,<note place="margin">Isa. 64. 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> 
               <hi>All our
righteousnes is as a cloath vtterly to be cast
away.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 2. 21.</note> And Paul to the Galatians: If
righteousnes be by the law, <hi>Christ died
without cause,</hi> or, <hi>in vaine:</hi> that is, if the
righteousnes of the law be our aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
Christ must be our losse: and on
the contrarie, if he be our aduantage, the
righteousnesse of the law must be our
losse.</p>
            <p>This doctrine of Paul, that all vertues
and workes both of nature and grace
are losses in the case of our saluation,
soundes not in mans reason, and there
be many things brought to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
First, it is alleadged, that God doeth
accept and crowne our works: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that they are not losses. I answer:
God doeth as it were keepe a double
court. One of iustice, the other of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.
In the court of iustice he giues
iudgement by the lawe, and accurseth
euery man that doth not continue in all
things written in the lawe to doe them.
In this court nothing can stand but the
passion and righteousnesse of Christ, &amp;
for the best workes that we can doe, we
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:3595:12"/>
may not looke for any acceptation or
reward: but vse the plea of Dauid, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
not, O Lord, into iudgement with
thy seruant, for no flesh shall be iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in thy sight. Nowe in the court of
grace and mercie, God hath to deale
with his owne children that stand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him iustified and reconciled by
Christ. And the obedience of such he
accepteth in this court, and mercifully
rewardeth, though otherwise it be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect;
yet not for the merit thereof,
but for the merit and worthinesse of
Christ. Thus then good works in rigour
of iustice are worthy condemnation, &amp;
are accepted of mercie procured by the
merit of Christ. Secondly it is alleadged
that workes are necessarie to saluation,
and therefore not to be reputed losses.
I answer: workes may be considered
either as causes of saluation, or onely as
a waie directing thereto. If they be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
as causes, they are not necessary,
but in this respect they are dung. If they
be respected as a way leading and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
to eternall life, they are indeede
necessarie thus, &amp; no otherwise. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:3595:12"/>
it is obiected that the law requires
workes, and the law must be satisfied, &amp;
therfore that he which is iustified, must
be iustified by workes. The answere is,
that whosoeuer is iustified and saued, is
iustified and saued by works. But works
must be distinguished. Some are perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
workes done in and by our selues.
These neither iustifie nor saue any man,
but in the case of saluation are losse and
doung. Besides these, there be workes,
that are out of vs, wrought in and by
the person of our Sauiour Christ, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the workes of obedience in satisfying
and fulfilling the lawe. These indeede
are the workes, which iustifie and saue
vs, &amp; none that proceede fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs. To this
effect Paul saith,<note place="margin">Rom 3. 24.</note> 
               <hi>that we are iustified free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the redemption that is in Christ.</hi> Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
it is alleadged, that if all vertues be
losse for Christ, then faith it selfe. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer:
Faith must diuersly be considered,
first of all, as a vertue working &amp; bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth many good fruites in vs. And
thus it is to be reputed losse, as all other
vertues are. Secondly it must be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
not as a vertue, but as an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:3595:13"/>
or hand not to giue or worke any
thing, but to apprehend and receiue
Christ and his benefits. And thus it is no
losse, but is a thing excepted in this text.
Nowe then we see that the doctrine of
Paul is manifest, that all vertues and
workes both of nature and grace, are
meere losses in the cause of our iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and saluation.</p>
            <p>Hence sundrie things may be lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
The first, that the most holy works
of holy men cannot iustifie or merit e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
life. When they are brought
within the Act of iustification as causes,
Paul saith they are but losse, and as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles
to be cast to dogges. Let this be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and remembred for euer against all
iustitiarie papists. Who, if they would
but seriously consider this one text, they
might be farre better resolued then they
are.</p>
            <p>Secondly, hence the doctrine of our
our church is plainely gathered, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that we are saued and iustified by
faith alone. For all things except our
knowledge and faith in Christ are made
as doung. And that this our doctrine
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:3595:13"/>
may not be scandalous, sundry things
must be remembred. The first is the
right meaning of the doctrine, which is,
that there is nothing within vs, that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
cause either efficient, materiall, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall,
or finall of iustification but faith.
The second, that faith is no principall
cause, but onely an instrument. The
third, that faith is no instrument to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
or worke our iustification and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,
but an instrument to receiue or
to apprehend our iustification giuen by
the father, procured by the sonne, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
by the holy Ghost. The last, that
faith must be considered as a cause, or
else, as a waie of saluation. If, as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
cause in vs, it onely iustifieth and
consequently saueth vs. If as a waie, it
doth not saue alone. For other vertues
and workes though they be no causes,
yet are they waies to eternall life as well
as faith. Here then when papists make
outcries against vs, saying that we looke
to be saued by faith alone: the true and
plaine answere to them is this. We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
faith two waies: first as a cause
within vs, not meriting any way, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumentally
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:3595:14"/>
apprehending pardon in
Christ and applying it to vs for our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
happinesse. Secondly, faith may
be considered as a way in which we are
to walke for the attainement of euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
life. In the first sense faith alone iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifieth
and saueth, and nothing els with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
vs. To this doe the learned fathers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

went not alone, but had a kind of co-o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration
with his works: faith &amp; works
both beeing considered as a way to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse
or as markes in a way. In this
sense the fathers haue ascribed saluation
to many things,<note place="margin">Libro de gratia &amp; lib. arbitrio. via regni non causa regnandi, Epitom. diu. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitut c. 9.</note> not as to causes, but as
to waies. Bernard said well, that workes
are <hi>the way to the kingdome of heauen and
not the causes of raigning.</hi> Lacta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tius saith,
<hi>Great is the helpe of Repentance: which,
whosoeuer taketh away,</hi>
               <note place="margin">homil. 38. in. Ioh.</note> 
               <hi>cuts off to himselfe
the way of life.</hi> Chrysostome: <hi>Some by
watching, by sleeping on the bare ground, by
tewing their bodies with daily labour doe
blot out their sinnes: but thou maiest obtaine
the same by a more easie way, that is, by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing.</hi>
Thus many hundred places of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:3595:15"/>
the fathers are to be vnderstood, when
they ascribe remission of sins to martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
to fasting, praier, workes of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
and such like.</p>
            <p>Thirdly here is laid downe the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of true humilitie. For if all our
vertues and workes be losses in the case
of our saluation, then all boasting is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
and we are to take nothing to
our selues but shame and confusion and
giue al glorie to God. Yea the more our
vertues are and workes, if we place any
confidence in them, the greater are our
losses.</p>
            <p>Thus we see what things are losses to
Paul: in the next place let vs consider
howe they are losses. This Paul settes
downe by a gradation thus, <hi>I count them
losse, I make them my losses, I count them as
doung.</hi> This gradation is nothing els but
a repetition of one and the same thing
inlarged and amplified in speech. Nowe
repetitions in scripture are not idle and
vaine, as they are oftentimes in the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of men, but they commonly signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
two things, namely the certainty and
the necessitie of the thing repeated: and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:3595:15"/>
therefore in this place, they signifie the
certaintie and the necessitie of Pauls los<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</p>
            <p>Certaine they are: because he that
will be saued by Christ must certainely
indure these losses without recouerie.
The foundation of this certenty lies in
an impossibilitie of merit by any works
of man: which I will make manifest by
fiue reasons. The first is this: It is a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
part of Christian inherent righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse
to haue and keepe a good
conscience: now Paul expresly excludes
it from iustification saying, <hi>I know
nothing by my selfe, yet am I not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
iustified.</hi> 1. Cor. 4. 4. The second is this,
Paul saith, Eph. 2. 9. <hi>we are not saued by
workes:</hi> nowe he meanes no other
workes but such as followe faith, and
are done by the spirit of God. And this
appeares by the reasons which he v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth,
<hi>that we are created to good works,</hi>
and againe that <hi>they are ordained that
we should walke in them.</hi> The third:
before a worke can meritte, it must
please God: before the worke please
God, the worker must please him:
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:3595:16"/>
before the worker please him he must
be reconciled to God and perfectly iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified.
Iustification therefore goes in
order before good workes, and for this
cause workes cannot be brought with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the acte of iustification as causes.
Good workes make not good men in
whole or in part; but men first of all
made good by the goodnesse of Christ
imputed, make good workes by their
goodnesse. The fourth is this: The hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie
of Christ is the most excellent
of all creatures in heauen and earth: yet
beeing considered by it selfe, it cannot
possibly merit at Gods hand. In a work
properly meritorious there be three co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.
First, the doer thereof must do
it by himselfe, and not by another, for
then the praise is his by whome he
doth it, and not his owne. Secondly the
worke to be done, must not be a debt or
dutie, for then the doer deserues no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
Thirdly there must be a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
betweene the worke and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of life eternall. Now the manhood
of Christ considered apart by it selfe,
cannot performe these three conditions.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:3595:16"/>
For it doth what it doth by the spirit of
God, whereby it was conceiued and is
filled without measure. Againe it is a
creature, and therefore whatsoeuer it is,
hath, or can doe, it oweth all to God.
Lastly it cannot doe a worke proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall
to eternall glorie: because it takes
all of God and can giue nothing to him.
If then it be demanded, howe this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
of Christ merits in our behalfe: I
answere, not by it selfe, but by meanes
of the personall vnion, whereby it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
and preferred into the vnitie of the
second person the eternall Word of the
father. Hence it is that Christ meriteth:
none can merit of God but God. Now
then if Christ merit onely in this regard,
no meere creature, man, or angell can
possibly merit by any worke. The fifth
reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is this: There be two kinds of tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression
of the lawe, one when a worke
is directly against the law: the other is,
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that is don which the law requires,
but not in that manner and perfection
the lawe requires. The second kind of
transgression is in euery good worke
which is done by men vpon earth:
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:3595:17"/>
now where any transgression is, there
must be pardon: where pardon is, there
is no merit.</p>
            <p>That this doctrine of the certentie of
our losses may yet the better be cleared,
I will set downe the supposed grounds
of merit, and discouer their weaknesse.
They are two: the first is the Promise
that God hath made to workes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he hath bound himselfe to reward
them with eternall glorie. I answer, that
this very promise is made of the good
pleasure, and meere good will of God:
and of the same goodnes it is, that any
man is a doer of any good worke, either
by nature or grace. Therefore, if a
man could fulfill the whole law, he
should not merit at Gods hand. Thus
saith the Lord, Exod. 20. 6. <hi>That he will
shew</hi> mercie <hi>vpon thousands of them that
loue him and keepe his commaundements.</hi>
The second ground is, That vertue of
meriting is deriued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christ the head
to his members by diuine influence. I
answer, it is a thing vnpossible. For the
vertue of meriting is in Christ not sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
as he is Man, but as he is in one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:3595:17"/>
God and Man. The worke which
meriteth is done or acted euen by the
manhood; but the merit of the worke
is from the Godhead, or from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie
of the person. Now then if this
vertue be in Christ, not as he is man, but
in respect he is Man-god, or God-man;
it can not be deriued to vs that are but
men, vnlesse euery beleeuer should be
Deified, &amp; made of a meere man God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
which is impossible. Therefore
there is no capablenes or possibilitie of
merit in the worke of any meere man,
or creature whatsoeuer. For this cause
the true church of God euer detested
humane merit. The <hi>merit of congruitie</hi>
before iustification is a Pelagian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
and was neuer maintained of the
orthodoxe Fathers. Stapleton confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
thus much:<note place="margin">De orig. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

               <hi>The merit of congruitie</hi>

               <hi>No man may thinke that
God is bound as it were by a bargaine, to

God is free to promise, so is he free in respect

God crownes nothing els in vs but his grace:

               <note place="margin">Bern de Annunc. Virg. serm 1. an. 1140.</note> S. Bernard saith, <hi>Touching eternall
life, we know that the sufflerings of this
time are not worthie of the glorie to come;
no not if one man should suffer all. For the
merits of men are not such, that eternall
life may be due for them, or that God should
doe some iniurie if he gaue it not. For to
let passe, that all merits are the gifts of
God, and so man is rather debter to God
for them, then God to man, what are all
merits to so great a glorie? Lastly, who is
better then the Prophet, to whome the
Lord giueth so worthie a testimonie, saying:
I haue found a man according to mine owne
heart: for all that he had need to say to
God, Enter not into iudgement with thy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant.</hi>
Againe in the processe of time,
when the merit of condignitie had take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
place, it was not generally receiued: for
it was reiected of sundrie schoolemen
and others, as of Gregorie of Arimine,
of Durand, of Waldensis, of Burgensis
and Scotus. Wherefore to conclude, it
now appeares to be an infallible certen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
that he which desires to be saued by
Christ, must indure the losse of all his
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:3595:19"/>
workes and vertues whatsoeuer, in the
cause of his owne iustification.</p>
            <p>Nowe then if this doctrine be so cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
and infallible, as it is: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> also must
we be setled in this point without doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
that the present church of Rome
erreth grieuously, in that it magnifieth
the merit of workes. Yea in this regard
it reuerseth the very foundation of true
religion. For if they make aduantage in
the matter of saluation by their workes,
Christ must needes vpon infallible cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentie
be their losse: because Paul makes
all workes losse, that Christ may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage.
Therefore farre be it from vs
all, to haue any dealing or contract of
societie with that church, least we be
partakers of her dangerous and feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
losses.</p>
            <p>Againe in that all vertues &amp; workes
of grace, are but losses for Christ. We
must not onely in our first conuersion,
but euer afterward though we be iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
and sanctified euen in the pang of
death by meere faith rest on the meere
mercie of God, and apprehend naked
Christ, that is, Christ seuered in the case
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:3595:19"/>
of saluation, from all respect of all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
and workes whatsoeuer. For there
is nothing that may be opposed to the
seuere iudgement of God, but meere
Christ. If we doe presume to oppose
any of our doings to the sentence of the
law, hell, death, condemnation, we are
sure to goe by the losses.</p>
            <p>Thus much of the certentie of Pauls
losses: now follows the necessitie of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
They are necessarie in as much as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, no man can haue part in Christ.
For the merit of our vertues and good
workes, and the grace of God in Christ
can not stand together: yea they are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
as fire and water, and one ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth
the other in the cause of iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
and saluation. Paul to signifie
this contrarietie saith,<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 6.</note> 
               <hi>If Election be of
grace, it is not of workes:</hi> and if it be of
workes,<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 4.</note> it is not of grace. And againe,
If ye be iustified by the law, ye are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolished
from Christ. And to the same
purpose Ambrose saith, <hi>Grace is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
receiued, or wholly lost:</hi> and Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine,
<hi>It is no way grace, that is not freely
giuen euery way.</hi> Hence it followes, that
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:3595:20"/>
the present religion of the church of
Rome abolisheth Christ, in as much as
it maintaines and magnifies the merit of
good workes. And this may be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by the very doctrine of that church.
For it teacheth that men must be saued
by their praiers, fastings, almes, pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages,
buildings of churches, chappels,
bridges, &amp;c. What then shall the passion
of Christ doe? whereto serues it? They
answer, that it frees vs from death, and
giues to our works the merit of eternall
life, and makes them meritoriously to
increase our iustification. Hence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes,
that Christ is no more but the
first cause of our saluation, and that we
our selues are secondarie causes vnder
him and with him. And thus he is made
of a Sauiour no Sauiour. For either he
must be a full and perfect Sauiour in
himselfe, or no Sauiour. Secondly by
the former necessitie we learne, that
whosoeuer will be saued by the merit of
Christ, must come vnto him without
vertues or workes of his owne, not carr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ying
in heart so much as the least con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in them, esteeming himselfe to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:3595:20"/>
be a most vile, wretched, and miserable
sinner, as the Publican did, who praied,
Lord, be mercifull to me a sinner.</p>
            <p>Hitherto of Pauls losses: now follows
the second part of the comparison, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
Pauls gaine, <hi>But Christ is my gaine.</hi>
A sentence to be remembred, and to be
written in the tables of our heart for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.
And the reason thereof is manifest.
Christ our Mediatour God and man, is
the onely Fountaine of all good things
that are or can be thought on, whether
spirituall or temporall. Saint Iohn saith,
<hi>Of his fulnes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 1. 16.</note>
               <hi>we receiue grace for grace.</hi>
Againe Paul saith,<note place="margin">Coloss. 2. 9, 10</note> 
               <hi>In him al the treasures
of knowledge and wisdome are hidde:</hi> and,
<hi>Ye are complete in him.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Tim. 2. 6.</note> And he calls
Christ <hi>our Ransome, or counterprice.</hi> And
as he makes Adam the roote of all euill
in mankinde, so makes he Christ the
roote of all grace and goodnes. For the
better clearing of this doctrine, two
points are to be handled: When Christ
is our gaine? and how? Touching the
time when, I set downe three things. He
is our gaine in this life: he is our gaine
in death: and he is our gaine after death.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:3595:21"/>
To returne to the first: He is our gaine
in life, if we turne from our euill waies,
and beleeue in him; in as much as he
hath gained for vs many benefits, which
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> I will reduce to tenne heads. The first is,
pardon of sinne, without tearme of
time, whether past, present, or to come.
Yet must we here reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber that pardon
of sinne is not giuen absolutely whether
men repent or no, but vpon condition
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of repentance. The second, is the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of Christs obedience in fulfilling
the law, for our iustification before
God. From the former benefit ariseth
our freedome from hell and from the
law, in respect of the curse thereof: and
from the second ariseth a Right to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
life; whereof the possession is reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> to the life to come. The third is our
Adoption, whereby we are the children
of God, and brethren of Christ. And
hence haue we a Right of lordship or
dominion ouer the whole world, and
all things contained therein, whether
in heauen or in earth: which right
was lost by Adam, and is now resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by Christ. Indeede wicked men
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:3595:21"/>
and infidels haue and vse the things of
this life at their wills, and that by Gods
permission: but yet they receiue and
inioy them no otherwise, then children
of traytours doe the goods of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
who peraduenture are suffered to
take benefite of some part of them for
the preseruing of their liues, though ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
and interest to them be not restored.
The fourth is the ministerie, that is, the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
presence,<note place="margin">Heb. 1. 14.</note> aide, and protection of the
good angels. The fifth gaine or benefit <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
is, that all the miseries and calamities of
this life, cease to be curses, and are made
blessings,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 26.</note> beeing turned to the good of
them that are to be saued by Christ. The <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
sixth is the mortification of originall
sinne, with all the parts thereof, by the
vertue of the death of Christ. The 7.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>
is a spirituall life, whereby we liue not,
but Christ liues in vs, making vs parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of his Annointing, and thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling
vs to liue as Prophets, Priests,
kings. Prophets, to teach and make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of our faith in Christ: Priests, to
dedicate and present our bodies and
soules to God for the seruice of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:3595:22"/>
Kings, to beare rule and domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ouer the corruptions, and lusts of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> our hearts. The eight gaine is, that
Christ presents all our praiers and good
workes to his Father in his owne name:
and thus by his own Intercession makes
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> them acceptable vnto him. The ninth
gaine is, the presence of his spirit.
For when Christ ascended,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>

               </note> he tooke
with him our pawne, namely our flesh,
and left with vs his owne Pawne, the
presence of the Comforter, to supplie
his owne presence, to guide, comfort,
and to assure vs of our adoption and
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> saluation. The tenth and last is Perseue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
in hauing &amp; holding the former
gaines. For thus faith the Lord, <hi>I will
put my feare into their hearts, that they
shall not depart from me.</hi>

but also in singular to euery true mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

sappe of grace in the heart to the ende.</p>
            <p>Againe, as Christ is our gaine in life,
so is he also our gaine in death, in as
much as he hath taken away the sting
of death, and hath changed the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it, by making it of the gate of hel,
to be the way to eternall life.</p>
            <p>Thirdly he is our gaine after death
three waies. Our first gaine is the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of our bodies to eternall life in
the day of iudgement. The second, is a
priuiledge to iudge the world.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 6. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> For first
of all iudgement shall passe vpon the
godly: which done, they shall be taken
vp to Christ, and there as witnesses and
approouers of his sentence of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
iudge togither with him, the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
world. The third is the eternall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution,
in which God shall be all in
all, first in Christ, and then in all the
members of Christ, and that for euer
and euer.</p>
            <p>The next point to be handled is,
How Christ is our gaine? For the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering
of this, two questions are to be
opened. The first is, According to what
nature is Christ our gaine? I answer, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:3595:23"/>
the ancient &amp; catholik doctrine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
That<note n="a" place="margin">August. hom. de ovious c. 12. Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mana divinitas, &amp; divina huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitas mediatrix est.</note> whol Christ is our gain according
to both natures. The godhead of Christ
profits no sinner without the manhood,
nor the manhood without the godhead,
And as Leo saith,<note place="margin">Leo epist. 10.</note> each nature worketh
that which is proper vnto it, hauing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
with the other. Againe,
God may be considered two waies; <hi>God
absolute,</hi> or <hi>God made man.</hi> God abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute,
that is, God absolutely considered
without respect to Christ, is indeede a
fountaine of righteousnes and life, but
this fountain <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s closed, sealed vp, and
not to be attained vnto: because our
sinnes make a separation betweene God
and vs, and God thus considered is a
Maiestie full of terrour to all sinnefull
men. But God considered as he was
made man and manifested in our flesh,
is also a fountaine of goodnes, yea the
same fountaine opened, vnsealed, and
flowing forth to all mankind. Hence it
is, that Christ is called the light of the
world; the bread and water of life; the
way, the truth, the life. Here againe we
must remember to make a difference or
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:3595:23"/>
distinction of the natures of Christ. For
the Godhead of Christ is our gaine not
in respect of essence, but in respect of
vertue and operation shewed in, or vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the manhood of Christ, whereby it
makes things which were done and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
in the said manhood apt and suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to appease Gods anger, &amp; to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
eternall life for vs. As for the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
it is not onely in effect and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but also really communicated to
the faith of the beleeuing heart: and her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
it is as it were a Treasurie and
storehouse of all the rich graces of God
that serue to iustifie, saue, or any way to
inrich the Elect of all ages and times
through the whole world. If any doubt
of this, let them consider three things of
this most glorious manhood. The first
is the <hi>grace of personall vnion,</hi> whereby it
is receiued into the Vnitie of the second
person, &amp; hath no beeing or subsisting,
but onely in the subsistance thereof.
And hence it is truly tearmed the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie
of the Sonne of God, or of the
Word. The second is, that this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
hath in it all fulnes of grace, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:3595:24"/>
called in schooles, <hi>habitual grace.</hi>
Now this fulnes of grace containes in it
all the gifts of the holy Ghost,<note place="margin">Ioh. 3. 35.</note> and that,
in the highest degree of perfection. It
hath therefore in it gifts more for num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
&amp; greater for measure; then all men
and angels haue. The third is, that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth
this excellencie of gifts and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
not for it selfe, but that it may be as
it were a pipe or conduit to conuaie the
same graces to all the Elect. Our salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and life depends on the fulnesse of
the Godhead which is in Christi neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse
it is not conuaied vnto vs but in
the flesh &amp; by the flesh of Christ. Thus
much Christ signifieth, when he saith:
<hi>My flesh is meate indeede.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 6. 51. 54.</note> And, <hi>Except ye
eate the flesh of the sonne of man and drinke
his blood, ye haue no life in you.</hi> And, <hi>He
which eateth my flesh abideth in me and I
in him.</hi> And Iohn the Baptist saith, <hi>Of
his fulnes we receiue grace for grace.</hi> The
supper of the Lord is ordained for the
increase and continuance of grace and
life: and of it Paul saith, <hi>The bread which
we breake, is a fellowship or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion with
the very bodie of Christ.</hi> On this manner
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:3595:24"/>
Christ is said <hi>to be made vnto vs of God,
wisdome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 1. 30.</note> 
               <hi>righteousnesse, sanctification, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.
Wisdom,</hi> not because the essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
wisdome of the godhead is giuen to
vs: for that is infinit and incommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Neither againe because he is the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of our wisdome, giuing vs know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of our saluation as the Father
and holy Ghost doe. Nor because he
is the matter of our wisdome, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of whome is eternall life: but for
an higher cause then all these. Our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour
the man Iesus Christ who is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
God, is an head vnto vs and a Roote
of our wisdome. For he was annointed
with the spirit of wisdome in the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>hood not priuatly for himselfe,
but that we also which beleeue might
be partakers of the same annointing, &amp;
that wisdome from him by his flesh
might be conueied vnto vs. Therefore
from his wisdome there is wisdome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued
in some measure to all that are
mystically vnited to him, as light in one
candle is deriued to an hundred, or as
heate is deriued from heate. Againe he
is <hi>our iustice,</hi> not onely because he is the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:3595:25"/>
author and giuer of our iustice, with the
father and the holy Ghost: neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the essentiall iustice of Christ is
giuen to vs: for then we should be all
deified: but because that iustice which
is in the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>hood, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sisting partly in the
puritie of nature, &amp; partly in the puritie
of actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whereby he obeyed his fathers
will and suffered all things to be suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for vs; this iustice I say, is imputed
to vs and accounted ours, according to
the tenour of the couenant, as if it were
inherent in vs. He is our Sanctification,
not onely because he is the author of it,
neither because the sanctitie or holines
of the godhead is communicated to vs:
but because he was sanctified in his ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
about all men and angels. And
from this holinesse of his, our holinesse
is deriued and springs as a fruit; as the
corruption in Adams posteritie is deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
from the corruption of Adam.
Christ saith, <hi>For their sakes sanctifie I my
selfe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 17. 19.</note> 
               <hi>that they also may be sanctified
through the truth.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cyril. in Ioh. l. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>1. c. 25.</note> Cyril saith, <hi>As God, he
giues himselfe the spirit, as man he receiues
it: which he doth not for himselfe, but for
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:3595:25"/>
vs, that the grace of sanctification out of
him and in him first receiued might passe to
all mankind.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lib. 11. c. 22.</note> Againe he saith, <hi>that the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
of our Lord being sanctified by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of the Word ioyned to it, is made so ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall
for mystical benediction, that it can
send forth his sanctification into vs.</hi> Lastly,
Christ is our <hi>Redemption or life</hi> on this
manner. In the person of the Mediatour
beeing one and the same, there is a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
life: one vncreated and essentiall, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing
to Christ as he is God. And
this life is not giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to vs at all, saue in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the efficacie thereof. For in god
we liue, mooue, and haue our beeing.
The other is the created life of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood:
and it is either naturall or spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual.
Naturall is that wherewith he liued
in the estate of humiliation by ordinary
means as all other men doe. Spirituall is
that whereby he nowe especially liueth
in the estate of exaltation and glorie.<note place="margin">Rom 6. 8.</note>
And this life he liueth not onely for
himselfe, but also for vs, that we beeing
partakers thereof, may liue togither
with him.<note place="margin">Cyril. in Iosu. l. 3. c. 37. &amp; 4. 12. 14. &amp; l. 10. 13.</note> Thus the ancient church hath
taught, the flesh of Christ vnited to the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:3595:26"/>
Word is made quickening flesh; that it
might further quicken them with spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
life, that are vnited to it.</p>
            <p>The next question is, in what estate
Christ is our Gaine? The estate of
Christ is twofolde, the estate of humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
from his birth to his death: and
the estate of exaltation in his resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
ascension, and his sitting at the right
hand of god. In the first estate he works
and procures our gaine. Christ lying
basely in the manger, and crucified ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominiously
on the crosse gained our
deliuerance from hell, and a right to life
euerlasting. In the second estate he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municats
to vs the gaine before named,
and by degrees puts vs in prossession of
it. And for this ende, he nowe sits at the
right hand of God and makes request
for vs.</p>
            <p>The vse of this doctrine, that Christ
is our gaine, is manifold. First it sheweth
that we in our selues are poore and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither
destitute of all spirituall good
things. For to this ende is Christ our
gaine, that he may supplie our want, &amp;
fill them with graces that are otherwise
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:3595:26"/>
emptie and euen hunger starued. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
it teacheth that men doe in vaine
seeke for so much as the least droppe of
goodnes out of Christ, who alone is the
storehouse of all good things. Heauen
and earth, men and angels, and all things
are but as nothing to vs, if by them we
seeke to inioy any thing out to Christ:
yea God is no god to vs without Christ.
Thirdly, we learne to detest the Treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
which the Church of Rome main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
and magnifies. It is as it were a
chest in which is contained not onely
the ouerplus of the merits of Christ, but
also of martyrs and Saints to be dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in pardons at the Popes pleasure.
But Christ is alone our full and perfect
gaine, and therefore in himselfe there is
an al-sufficient Treasurie of the church;
and as Paul saith,<note place="margin">Coloss. 2. 10</note> 
               <hi>in him we are complete.</hi>
As for the merits of martyrs and Saints,
they bring no aduantage to the people
of God, but are indeed matter for the
dounghill. Fourthly, if Christ be our
treasure and gain, our hearts must be set
on him. Our mindes vse to be vpon our
pennie, and we hunger after gaine: let vs
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:3595:27"/>
therefore hunger after Christ: he is out
pennie and he is our gaine. Nay we
must aboue all pleasures, honours, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits,
loue him, and reioice in him: yea we
should be swallowed vp with loue of
him. Lastly, here is matter of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort. In
the losse of goods and friendes, and all
calamities of this life, we may not be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed:
all the losses of this life are but
pettie losses, so long as we haue Christ
for our gaine. Nothing can be wanting
vnto vs in the middest of all our losses
and miseries, so long as we receiue of his
fulnesse, who is the fountaine of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
neuer dried vp.</p>
            <p>To proceed further, the second part
of the comparison <hi>[Christ is my gaine]</hi> is
amplified by a gradatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on this manner:
<hi>I esteeme the knowledge of Christ Iesus my
Lord an excellent thing: I desire to gaine
Christ: I desire to be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in Christ.</hi> Of these
in order. By the knowledge of Christ,
we are to vnderstand, the doctrine of the
gospell, or the doctrine of the person
&amp; offices of Christ co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiued &amp; known
of vs. To this knowledge an excellency
is ascribed, of which I will speake a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:3595:27"/>
This excellencie appeares partly in
the matter and contents, &amp; partly in the
effects thereof. Touching the matter, it
is ful of excellent mysteries, which Paul
reduceth to fixe heads in his epistle to
Timothie.<note place="margin">1. Tim. 3. 16</note> The first is the Incarnation
of the sonne of God in these wordes,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
               <hi>God made manifest in the flesh.</hi> And here
two wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders offer themselues to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered:
the first, whereas Adams flesh
and Adams sinne are inseparably ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
togither in respect of all that nature
can doe, yet did the sonne of God take
vnto him mans nature and flesh with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
mans sinne: because he was concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
of a virgin by the operation of the
holy ghost: whereas if he had beene co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
by naturall generation, he had
with Adams flesh taken Adams cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.
The other wonder in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation
of Christ is, that the flesh of
man is vnited to the person of the sonne
of God, &amp; thence hath his subsistance,
otherwise hauing no subsistance of his
owne. The like example is not to be
found in the world againe: sauing that
we haue some resemblance thereof in
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:3595:28"/>
the plant called Miscelto, which hath no
roote of his own, but grows as a branch
of the oake, or some other tree, and hath
his life and sappe from the roote there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The second mysterie in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Christ, is the Iustification of
Christ in these wordes, <hi>iustified in the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:</hi>
and it was on this manner. Christ
made man became our Suretie and was
subiect to the law for vs. Hereupon our
sinnes were imputed to him, and the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
due thereto laid vpon him,
that is, the first death with the paines of
the seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: yea further death in the graue
had dominion ouer him. After all this,
by his spirit or power of the godhead
he raised himselfe from death, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
acquit himselfe of our sinnes; and
this acquitall or absolution is his iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
whereby he declareth himselfe
to be a Sauiour perfectly righteous. For
if he had not satisfied the wrath of God
to the full, and brought perfect righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes,
he had neuer risen againe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
he was iudged and condemned
for our sinnes. The third mysterie is <hi>the
sight of Angels,</hi> who desired to looke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:3595:28"/>
the Incarnation of Christ: in which
they sawe three things, as Luke testifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.
The first, that it was a means to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
<hi>the glorie of God:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 2.14.</note> the second, that
it brought <hi>peace</hi> and good successe to
men vpon earth: the third, that it was a
meanes to reueale <hi>the good will of God</hi> to
the world. The fourth, is the <hi>preaching <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
of Christ to the Gentiles.</hi> This appeares to
be a great mysterie; because the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Christ was kept secret from the
nations,<note place="margin">Rom. 16. 2<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> for the space of more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 4000.
yeares. For from the creation to Moses
the church of God was shut vp in a litle
familie: from Moses to Christ, it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
within the precincts of Iewrie:
which was not so much as the fourth
part of England. The fift mysterie was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
the <hi>Conuersion of the world</hi> to the faith of
Christ. And this is so much the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
wonder; because this conuersion was
wrought by the preaching of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
which is flatte against the naturall
reason and will of man, and therefore
vnfit to perswade: and the preachers
hereof were simple and silly men to see
to: and some of them which were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:3595:29"/>
were the very Iewes that crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Christ. The last mysterie was the <hi>as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cension
of Christ into glorie.</hi> The greatnes
of this mysterie appeares in two things.
The first, that Christs ascension was a
reall and full opening of the kingdome
of heauen; which had formerly bin shut
by our sinnes. The second, that the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cension
of Christ, was no personall or
priuate ascension: for he ascended in
the roome and stead of all the Elect: and
they ascended together in and with him,
and now after a sort are together in and
with him in glorie. Thus we see the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie
of the knowledge of Christ in
respect of the Mysteries contained
therein: the like excellencie appeares in
the effects thereof; which are two, the
knowledge of God, and of our selues.</p>
            <p>For the first, by the knowledge of
Christ, we know God aright. Hence
Christ is called <hi>the brightnes of the glorie
of the Father,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> and the <hi>ingrauen image of
his person:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Coloss. 1. 15.</note> and <hi>the image of the inuisible
God.</hi> And Paul saith notably, that when
God shineth in our hearts by the light
of the Gospel,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 4. 6.</note> 
               <hi>his glorie is to be seene in
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:3595:29"/>
the face of Christ.</hi> The wisdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e, power, &amp;
goodnesse of God is made manifest in
Christ: and that more fully then euer it
was in the creation. In the creation A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
beeing but a meere man was our
head; but in the estate of grace, Christ
is our head, God and man. By creation
we receiue but a naturall life to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
by foode: by Christ we receiue
a spirituall, to be preserued eternally
without foode; by the operation of the
spirit. As the spouse of Adam was bone
of his bone, and flesh of his flesh: so is
the spouse of Christ bone of his bone,
and flesh of his flesh; and that in more
excellent manner: because euery parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
man as he is borne anew, and the
whole catholike church the true spouse
of Christ, springeth &amp; ariseth out of the
merit and efficacie of the blood that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilled
out of the heart &amp; side of Christ.
In the creation God makes life of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:
but by Christ he drawes our life
forth of death, and changeth death it
selfe into life. Againe in the law the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
of God is set downe and reuealed:
in Christ we see more, namely perfect
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:3595:30"/>
iustice and perfect mercie, reuealed to
the full; yea (which is a wonder) iustice
and mercie reconciled. Lastly in Christ
we see the le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth, the breadth, the height,
the depth of the loue of God, in that
God vouchsafeth to loue the Elect with
the very same loue wherewith he loueth
Christ.<note place="margin">Ioh. 17. 23.</note>
            </p>
            <p>As by Christ we know God: so also
by Christ we know our selues: and that
on this manner. First we must consider,
that in the Passion he tooke our person
vpon him, and that vpon the crosse, he
stoode in our place, roome, and stead.
Secondly we are to consider the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of his agonie and passion set forth
vnto vs, especially by fiue things. The
first is the testimonie of the Euangelists,
who say in emphaticall wordes, that he
was <hi>full of sorrow,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math. 26. 37.</note> and <hi>grieuously troubled.</hi>
The second, his complaint, <hi>that his soule

we see the greatnes of Gods an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
against vs for our sinnes: we see the
greatnes of our sinnes: we see the vilenes
of our persons: we see the hardnes of
our hearts, that neuer so much as sigh
for our offences, for which the sonne of
God swette water and blood: we see our
vnthankfulnes that little respect or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerd
this worke of Christ. Lastly we
see our dutie: that we are to be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
touched with true repentance, and to
humble our selues as it were to the very
pit of hell: for if the son of God mourne
and crie for our sinnes imputed, we are
much more to crie and to bleed in our
hearts for them, seeing they are ours
properly,<note place="margin">Zach. 12. 10.</note> and by them we haue pierced
Christ. And thus the excellencie of the
knowledge of Christ is manifest.</p>
            <p>Hence we learne sundry things: first,
if the knowledge of Christ be so excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
we may not maruell, that by the
mallice of the deuill it hath bin corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
many hundred yeares in the Romish
church: which teacheth, that the Gospel
is nothing else in effect but the law of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:3595:31"/>
Moses perfected. Now if this were so,
Christ doubtlesse died in vaine, and we
might place our hope in our owne
righteousnes; and the promise of life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
by Christ, should be of none ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.
For the law neuer iustifies before
God, till it be perfectly kept: which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of perfection if men could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme,
there should be little neede of
Christ or of the Gospel. Secondly, if this
knowledge be of such excellencie, it
must be learned of vs, and that in speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
manner. If to other inferiour learning
we lend the vnderstanding and memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
to this we are to applie the whole
man. The minde must learne it by ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
it selfe to conceiue it: the memorie
must learne it, by storing it vp: the will
and affections must learne it, by resig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and conforming the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues in their
kinde vnto it. Thus Paul teacheth, that
<hi>to learne Christ,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 21, 22.</note> 
               <hi>as the truth is in Christ, is
to put off the old man and to put on the new
man, which after God is created in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
and holinesse.</hi> Thirdly by this we
learne to value &amp; prize the knowledge
of Christ, aboue all things in the world.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:3595:31"/>
The Angels of God themselues desire
to profit in this knowledge: Dauid, who
in the darknes of the old Testament de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
to be a dorekeeper in the house of
God;<note place="margin">Psal. 84.</note> if he were now liuing on earth,
would be content with an office a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
fold more base, that he might inioy
this cleere light of the knowledge of
Christ. But alas; there is no such Dauids
now a daies. It is our fault, and the fault
of our times, that this knowledge is of
little or no value and account among
men; and little fruit thereof to be seene.
And therfore it is to be feared, that God
will take this Treasure of knowledge
from vs,<note place="margin">2. Thess. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 10.</note> and send strong illusions to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
lies; because it is little or nothing
loued.</p>
            <p>Paul yet further co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mends this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in that he calls it, <hi>The knowledge of
Christ, HIS LORD.</hi> Now he is our
Lord foure waies. First, by the right of
donation (because all the Elect are giuen
to him of the Father in the eternal coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
of Election:) secondly by creation:
thirdly by the right of Redemption:
fourthly by right of headship; in that as
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:3595:32"/>
a liuing head he giues sense and spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
life to all that beleeue in him. And
Paul calls Christ <hi>his Lord,</hi> because he
beleeued his owne election, in which
he was giuen to Christ, his creation
and redemption by him, and his my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall
coniunction with him, as with
his head. And here Paul in his example
teacheth vs two things. The first, how
we should know Christ, and the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Gospell: For the right
knowledge whereof, there is required,
beside generall vnderstand of Christ &amp;
his benefits, with generall assent, a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
Application thereof. It is not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to beleeue the election, redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
iustification, glorification of Gods
people: but we must goe further, and
beleeue the very same things in our
selues. The reason may be taken from
the contents of the Gospel. For it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
two parts, the first is a promise in
which Christ with all his benefits is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and propounded vnto vs. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
is a commandement to applie the
said promise,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> and the substance thereof
to our selues, and that by our faith. And
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:3595:32"/>
he that takes away this second part, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowes
halfe the Gospel of Christ.
Here is the foundation of sauing know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,<note place="margin">Isa. 53.</note>
which iustifieth and bringeth
life eternall;<note place="margin">Ioh. 17. 3.</note> and the foundation of spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
faith. The second thing to be lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in Pauls example is, that we are to
resigne our selues, our bodies &amp; soules,
and to render all subiection to Christ.
For in that he calleth him Lord, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth
himselfe to be the seruant of
Christ.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 10. 5.</note> The ende of all preaching is to
bring not onely our words and deedes;
but also our secret thoughts in subiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
vnto him. And the ende why Christ
sits in glorie at the right hand of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is, that euery knee may bowe vnto
him of things in heauen and earth. It
behooues vs therefore to liue and carrie
our selues in our places as true and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained
seruants of Christ.</p>
            <p>The second degree in Pauls gradation
is, <hi>That he desires to Gaine Christ.</hi> Now to
gaine Christ is nothing els, but to make
Christ his gaine, as appeares by the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of the wordes. For he saith, he
<hi>had deprined himselfe of all things,</hi> that is,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:3595:33"/>
made all things his losse, <hi>that he might
gaine Christ.</hi> And he is made our gaine
if two things be done. First, he must be
made ours, that is, thy Christ or my
Christ in particular: secondly we must
put our confide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in him. For the first,
that Christ may be ours, a double con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
is required: Gods consent to giue
Christ, and our consent to receiue him.
Gods consent, that Christ shall be ours,
is giuen in the reuelation of the promise
touching the womans seed, made to our
first parents, in the continuall renewing
of the said promise to our forefathers, in
the incarnation and birth of Christ, in
his passion, in the preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell,
in the administration of both the
sacraments, baptisme and the Lords
supper. Our consent to receiue Christ, is
giuen when we beginne to beleeue in
him; yea when we beginne to be touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in our hearts for our sinnes, and to
hunger &amp; thirst after Christ. And thus
by the concurrence of these two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
is Christ really made ours. And
further yet, that he may be not onely
ours, but also our gaine, we must set and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:3595:33"/>
fixe the whole confidence of our hearts
vpon him alone, for the forgiuenesse of
our sins, and the saluation of our soules.
For where the gaine is, there must the
heart be. When riches increase we may
not set our heartes on them; because
though they be good things, yet are
they not our gaine or treasure: nowe
Christ is not onely a good thing vnto
vs, but our gaine, and the very fountaine
of all good things: &amp; therefore we must
bestowe our hearts on him.</p>
            <p>Hence we learne that the Popish re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
teacheth wickednesse. For it
maintaineth, that we are not onely to
beleeue in God, but also<note n="a" place="margin">Remenses in Rom. 10. 14.</note> in the church:
it maintaineth an hope<note n="b" place="margin">Thomas Bec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket  in Maria sp<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> totam ponit post Christum. Matth. Paris in Henrico. 11.</note> and confidence

our owne workes: so it be as they say in
sobrietie. This is to make the creature
our gaine, and to put downe Christ our
Redeemer.</p>
            <p>Againe, Paul had said in the<note n="d" place="margin">Phil. 1. 21.</note> former
chapter, that Christ was his gaine both
in life and death: and yet nowe he saith,
that <hi>he still desires to gaine Christ.</hi> And by
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:3595:34"/>
his example we learne, that in this life
our affectious must neuer be satisfied &amp;
filled with the desire of Christ, till we
haue the full fruition of him. Naturally
our desires be insatiable in respect of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
honours, pleasures: but we must
learne to moderate and stinte our selues
in seeking earthly things; beeing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with the portion that God doth
alot vs: and the insatiablenesse of our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
must be directed and turned
vpon Christ. The woman in the Gospel
that had the bloodie ishew, desired but
to touch the hemme of his garment; we
must goe further, not onely to touch
him, but also by our faith to lay hold on
him, as it were with both the hands, and
to hang vpon him. Thomas desired for
his contentation, but to put his finger
into his side: we must sette before our
eies Christ crucified: and his pretious
blood as it were a fresh distilling from
his handes, feete, and side: and we must
not onely touch this blood, but sprinkle
our selues with it, yea dip and as it were
diue out selues into it, bodie, soule, and
all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:3595:34"/>
The third and last degree in Pauls
gradation is, <hi>that he desires to be founde in
Christ.</hi> And here his desire is twofold, the
first, <hi>to be in Christ,</hi> the second, <hi>to be found
so</hi> of God in the daie of iudgement. The
first, To be in Christ, is to be taken out
of the first Adam, and to be vnited vnto
Christ as his very flesh, or as a true me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of his mysticall bodie. Now this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporation
and vnion into Christ is a
mysterie; and for the better vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of it foure rules must be obserued.
The first, that not onely our soules are
vnited to the soule or godhead of
Christ: but also that the whole person
of him that beleeueth is vnited to the
whole person of Christ. For the Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
and they which are redeemed are
vnited togither: and Christ God and ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
redeemed vs, not onely in soule but also
in bodie. We therefore beleeuers, haue
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> our whole persons vnited to the
whole person of Christ. And S. Paul
saith,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 6. 15.</note> 
               <hi>that our verie bodies are the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Christ.</hi> And Christ himselfe saith,<note place="margin">Ioh 6. 56.</note>
               <hi>that we must eate his flesh and drinke his
blood, that we may be in him and he in vs.</hi>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:3595:35"/>
The second rule, is touching the order
of this vnion: That we are first ioyned
to the flesh of Christ, and by his flesh to
his godhead. For that which brings vs
to haue fellowship with God, ioynes vs
to God. Now by the flesh of Christ we
haue our fellowship with God. It is as
the vaile of the temple, whereby the
high priest entred into the Holie of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 20.</note>
and into the presence of God. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
it serues as a pipe or conduit to
deriue the efficacie and operation of the
godhead vnto vs. The third rule is: that
this vnion standes not in imagination,
but is a true and reall coniunction. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth the distance of place (we bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on earth and the flesh of Christ in
heauen) hinder this vnion. The minde is
vnited after a sort to the thing it mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.
After the contract of marriage, two
distinct persons being a thousand miles
asunder, remaine one flesh. If nature af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foard
thus much: why may not the like
be found in the coniuction that is aboue
nature? The last rule is: That the bond
of this coniunction is one and the same
spirit, beeing both in Christ and vs: first
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:3595:35"/>
in Christ and then in vs. This teacheth
S. Iohn saying,<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 3. 23<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> 
               <hi>that Christ dwels in vs by
his spirit giuen vnto vs.</hi> Againe this spirit
worketh in vs faith, which also knits vs
to Christ:<note place="margin">Eph. 3. 17.</note> who as Paul saith, <hi>dwels in our
hearts by faith.</hi> And by this we further
see that distance of place hinders not
this vnion. The spirit of God beeing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit
may dwell both in Christ and vs: &amp;
our faith though it be seated within our
hearts, yet can it reach foorth it selfe and
apprehend Christ in heauen.</p>
            <p>The second desire of Paul is, that he
<hi>may be found of God to be in Christ,</hi> that is,
that God would respect him as a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Christ and accept him into his
fauour eternally for Christ. For the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
vnderstanding of this; the order that
God vseth in shewing his loue must be
obserued. First of all, he begins his loue
in Christ, whome he loues simply for
himselfe: then from Christ he descends
to them that are vnited to Christ, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
them euen as parts of Christ:
whome also he loueth, yet not simply,
but respectiuely, in and for Christ. He
that lookes vpon things of diuers kinds
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:3595:36"/>
through a greene glasse, beholdes them
all to be greene: euen so, whome God
respecteth in and for Christ, they are lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
of God as he is loued, and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
as he is righteous. And this is the
thing which Paul desireth, that in the
daie of iudgement he may be thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected.</p>
            <p>Hence we learn, that God will make
an examination of all our hearts, liues,
and works, in the day of iudgement. For
this Finding which Paul mentioneth,
presupposeth, that God sees and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serues
our waies, and will one daie cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenly
discouer them, knowing eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> now
certainly whether we be in Christ or no.
For this cause we are to call our selues to
an account, yea to a strait account: for
God will find out whatsoeuer is amisse,
though we haue skill to make faire
shewes before men. And we are withall
to amend our selues. Salomon vpon this
ground disswades the young man from
fornication; <hi>why shouldest thou my sonne</hi>
(saith he) <hi>take delite in a straunge woman,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pro. 5. 11.</note>
               <hi>seeing the waies of men are before the cies
of God, and he pondereth all their pathes.</hi>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:3595:36"/>
To this purpose the Iewes haue a saying
worth our marking: write say they three
things in thy heart, and thou shalt neuer
sinne: <hi>There is an eie that seeth thee, an
eare that heareth thee, and a hand that
writeth all thy sayings &amp; doings in a booke.</hi>
And the cause of our manifold sinnes
is, that men falsely thinke, that God nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sees nor heares them. Thus saith
Dauid of his enemies;<note place="margin">Psal. 59. 8.</note> 
               <hi>They bragge in
their talke, and swordes are in their lippes,
for say they who heareth vs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, here we see Pauls care, yea
the pitch of all his desires and his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
forecast, that he might be found
of God in the day of iudgement to be a
member of Christ. The like must be
our care and forecast nowe in the time
of this life: yea this must be the care of
all cares, that we may be knit to Christ,
and so accepted of God, when we shall
rise to iudgement.<note place="margin">Luk. 21. 36.</note> Christ bids vs, <hi>watch
and praie that we may stand before the
sonne of man:</hi> and this we cannot doe, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
we be incorporate into Christ. We
are bidden first to seeke the kingdome
of heauen: and that is indeed to be in
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:3595:37"/>
Christ. To be wise and circumspect in
many matters, and yet to want forecast
to compasse our maine and principall
good, is the greatest follie of all. What
is the fault of the foolish virgins? virgins
they were as the wise: they carried the
burning lamps of Christian profession:
likewise they had oyle, that is, the oyle of
grace: but, alas, they had not oyle e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to furnish their lampes. Their
fault was, that they wanted forecast to
furnish themselues with oyle sufficient.
And there is neuer sufficiencie of oyle,
till we be true and liuely members of
Christ. And this was their damnable
follie, that they contented themselues
with the name and profession of Christ,
and had not a serious and speciall care
indeed to be members of Christ. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let vs now diligently indeauour to
be that in this life, which we desire to be
found of God in the day of iudgement.
There be three iudgements which we
are to vndergoe, the iudgement of men,
of our selues, and of God. The two first
we may falsifie, the third we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not. For
men we may deceiue, and our selues we
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:3595:37"/>
may deceiue; but God we can not. It is
the foundation of all good things to be
ingraffed into Christ: and for this cause,
all the forecast of our heads, all other
cares and studies should giue place that
this be might acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plished. Som ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may
hereupon demand, what he should doe,
that he might be in Christ. I answer, two
things: first he must breake off all his
sinnes, and turne vnto God: secondly,
he must pray earnestly euen vnto the
death, that his heart may be knitte to
Christ. Againe it may be demanded,
how it may be knowne of vs, that we are
in Christ.<note place="margin">2. Ioh. 3.</note> S. Iohn answereth: <hi>Hereby we
know that he dwelleth in vs by the spirit
which he hath giuen vs.</hi> And we may
know that we haue the spirit of Christ,
if the same mind, inclination, and dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
the like loue to God and man,
the like meeknesse, patience and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
be in vs which was in Christ. For
the same fruites argue the same spirit.</p>

is of the faith of Christ, &amp;c.</q>
            <p>The Apostle hauing taught in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:3595:38"/>
tearmes, that Christ is his gaine, here
beginnes to declare the same in more
particular sort. For he sets downe a
threefold gaine which he desired to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
of Christ: the first is, <hi>the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of Christ:</hi> the second is, <hi>inward fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
with him:</hi> the third is, <hi>the resurrection
of the bodie</hi> to eternall glorie. Now this
righteousnesse of Christ which Paul
makes his first gaine, is handled in the 9.
verse: for the better knowledge where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
I will first open the meaning of the
wordes. And first of all, it must be
knowne, that they are an exposition of
the wordes which went before. For
whereas Paul had desired to be found
in Christ, now he shewes his owne mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
that he desired therein nothing els
but that he might be accepted of God
for Christs sake, and be esteemed righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
in his righteousnes. And that this
righteousnesse may be the better discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
he sets downe two sorts of iustice:
the one he refuseth, the other he desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
and chooseth. The righteousnes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused,
he calls it <hi>his owne:</hi> because it is
within him, and it is exercised by the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:3595:38"/>
powers of his soule, namely his minde,
will, affections. He saith further, it is <hi>of
the law,</hi> that is, of the workes which the
Law requireth: for (as Paul saith) <hi>the
righteousnes of the law is this,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 5.</note> 
               <hi>He that doth
these things shall liue therein.</hi> Againe of
the iustice desired, he saith, it is <hi>by the
faith of Christ,</hi> that is, it ariseth of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
of Christ apprehended by
faith.<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 22. 25.</note> For in this manner to the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
he puts the faith of Christ, for faith
in the blood of Christ. And whereas
some man might happily say, that euen
this righteousnes is ours as the former,
Paul addeth further, that <hi>it is of God,</hi>
wholly and onely, and not of vs either
in whole or in part; beeing freely giuen
of him <hi>vpon our faith,</hi> that is, when we
beleeue.</p>
            <p>In these few wordes Paul coucheth
many weightie points of doctrine. I
will distinctly propound them one by
one. First of all, he makes a double iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
one of the Law, the other of the
Gospel: yea he opposeth them as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries
in the case of iustification: and
that they may the better be conceiued,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:3595:39"/>
he describes them seuerally. Touching
the iustice of the law, he sets it downe
by two things. First, he saith, it is within
vs: because it is nothing els but a confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie
of heart &amp; life to the will of God,
reuealed in the said law. And the law
knowes not the righteousnes which is
without vs. Secondly he notes the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of it, that it consists of such vertues
and workes as the law prescribeth. Now
the iustice of the Gospell it is likewise
set forth by foure things. First, it is not
in vs, but forth of vs: because Paul op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth
it to the righteousnesse which is
ours and within vs. Secondly Paul sets
downe the matter of it, or the person in
whome it is, namely Christ. Of whome
Ieremie saith,<note place="margin">Ierem. 23.</note> 
               <hi>Iehoua is our righteousnes.</hi>
And Christ must be considered two
waies; as God, and as Mediatour: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to which two respects he hath
a double righteousnes. One as God, and
that is infinite, and therefore incommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable.
The other as Mediatour, is the
Obedience of Christ which he perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in his manhood, consisting of two
parts, his sufferings in life and death,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:3595:39"/>
and his fulfilling of the law for vs. And
this very obedience which is in Christ
and not in vs, is the very matter of the
iustice of the Gospel. Thirdly Paul sets
downe the meanes whereby this iustice
is made ours, and that is Faith, which
doth rest on Christ and applie his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to vs. Lastly Paul sets downe the
author of this Iustice, and that is God,
who of his grace and mercy freely giues
Christ and his obedience vnto vs, when
we beleeue. Out of these foure points a
definition of the Iustice of the Gospell
may be framed thus: It is the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of the Mediatour, namely the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of Christ giuen vs freely of God
and receiued by our faith.</p>
            <p>By this distinction of Legall and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelicall
iustice, we learne the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of the Law and the Gospel. The
Law promiseth life vpon the condition
of our workes, or obedience performed
according to the tenour of the law. The
Gospell requires not the condition of
merit, or of any work to be done on our
parts in the case of our iustification, but
onely prescribes vs to beleeue in Christ
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:3595:40"/>
and to rest on his obedience, as our iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
before the Tribunall of God. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
by this we learn, that the church
of Rome and the learned therein, are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of the right difference betweene
the Law and the Gospel. For they teach,
that the righteousnesse, which stands in
our inherent vertues and workes done
by vs, is required for iustification as wel
in the Gospell as in the Law: and that
the difference lies onely in this, that the
law is more darke, and without grace:
the Gospel more plaine, hauing also the
grace of God annexed vnto it, to inable
vs in our own persons to doe that which
both law and Gospell require. But this
is indeede to make a confusion of the
law and Gospell, and to abolish the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
of the twofold iustice before
named: which may not be.</p>
            <p>The second point of doctrine deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
by Paul is, That a sinner standes
iust before the tribunall seat of God, not
by the iustice of the law, but by the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
of faith, which is the obedience of
Christ, without any works of ours. And
because this point of doctrine is of great
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:3595:40"/>
moment, and is withall oppugned of
many, I will further confirme it by some
speciall reasons. First of all, in the iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of a sinner, God manifests his
mercie and iustice to the full. For, as
Paul saith,<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 24. 26.</note> 
               <hi>he iustifieth freely by his grace:</hi>
and in iustifying <hi>he is not onely a iustifier
but also iust.</hi> Now this concurrence of
mercie and iustice is no where to be
found, but in the Obedience of Christ,
performed by him in our roome and
stead. As for all Christian vertues and
works of godly men, they are by mercie
accepted of God, but they do not satisfie
the iustice of God according to the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the law. Secondly, Paul in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle
to the Rom. considering Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
not as an idolater vnconuerted, but as a
beleeuer,<note place="margin">Rom. 4. 1.</note> yea as the father of all the
faithfull; saith, that then <hi>he was iustified
without workes;</hi> and that, his faith, that is,
the Messias apprehended by his faith,
was counted vnto him for righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
long after his conuersion. Nowe,
as he, who is a patterne for vs to follow,
is iustified, so must we be iustified, and
no otherwise. Thirdly, as by Adams dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:3595:41"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:3595:43"/>
we are made sinners:<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 19.</note> so by
Christs obedience are we made righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous:
but but by Adams disobedience
<note n="a" place="margin">Lira vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Rom. 5. &amp; Bellar. de grat. ami. 1. l. 5. c. 17.</note>imputed to vs, are we made sinners:

of Christ imputed. Bernard vsed
this reason.<note place="margin">In Dominica. 1. po. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

               <hi>Whome</hi> (saith he) <hi>another
mans fault defiled, another mans water wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed.
Yet in calling it another mans fault,
I doe not denie it to be ours: otherwise it
could not defile vs. But it is another mans,
because we all not knowing of it, sinned in
Adam. It is ours; because we haue sinned,
though in an other, and it is imputed to vs
by the iust iudgement of God, though it be
secret. Yet, that thou maist not complaine, ô
man, against the disobedience of Adam,
there is giuen thee the obedience of Christ:
that beeing sould for naught, thou maist be
redeemed for naught.</hi> Again the doctrine
of imputed iustice he teacheth expresly,
saying:<note place="margin">Epist. 190.</note> 
               <hi>Al are dead, that the satisfaction of
one might be imputed to all, as he alone bare
the sinnes of all.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ad milites temp. c. 11.</note> Againe, <hi>Death is put to
flight by the death of Christ, and the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes
of Christ is imputed to vs.</hi> Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1. 30.</note>
Paul saith, <hi>Christ is made vnto vs of
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:3595:43"/>
God, iustice,</hi> that is, iustice imputed: for in
the next words he saith, he is <hi>made our
sanctification,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Cor. 5. 21.</note> that is, our iustice not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted,
but inherent. Fiftly, as Christ
was made sinne, so are we made the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
of God, but Christ was made our
sin not by any conueiance of any cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
into his most holy heart, but
by imputation. We therefore are made
the iustice of God by like imputation.
And least any man should yet surmise
that this iustice is not imputed; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
into vs, Paul saith, <hi>We are made
the iustice of God IN HIM,</hi> that is,
in Christ. Hence it followeth mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly,
that there is no vertue or worke
within vs which iustifieth before God,
and that our iustice whereby we are iust
in the fight of God, and accepted to life
eternall, is out of vs, &amp; placed in Christ.
Thus much haue the Fathers obserued
vpon this text of Paul. Augustine saith,
that Christ was made sinne,<note place="margin">Fnchir. c. 41 &amp; de verbis Apost. Serm. 6.</note> that we
might be made iustice, <hi>not our iustice,</hi>
but Gods iustice, <hi>neither in vs,</hi> but in
him: as he declared sinne not to be his,
but ours, not placed in him but in vs.
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:3595:44"/>
Hierome saith, Christ being offered for
vs tooke the name of sin that we might
be made the righteousnesse of God in
him, <hi>not ours, nor in vs.</hi> In the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
speake Theophilact, Anselme, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulius
presbyter, and others. Lastly, ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
considered as a creature before his fall,
owed vnto God the fulfilling of the
lawe, which as a certaine tribute was
daily to be paid vnto him. After the fall,
he doubled his debt, because he then
became debter to God of a satisfaction
due for the breach of the lawe. Now the
not paiment of this double debt is our
vnrighteousnes. But where may we find
a sufficient paiment for this debt? We
our selues by our sinnes daily increase
the said debt. And our owne workes,
though proceeding of faith, are no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient
paiment: because we cannot by
one debt paie an other. And if we shall
search through heauen and earth, there
is nothing to be found, that may stand
for paiment with God, but the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the Redeemer, which he hath
presented and laid downe before the
throne of the Almightie, as an endlesse
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:3595:44"/>
treasure to make paiment in our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe.
And because the said obedience is
a satisfaction for our vnrighteousnes, it
is also our iustice in the acceptation of
God. By these and other reasons, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares,
that nothing can absolue vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God, and procure the right of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
life, but the onely obedience of the
Mediator Christ, God and man: &amp; that
without any vertue or worke of ours.</p>
            <p>Hence it followes that the present
Church of Rome corrnpts the article of
iustification by mingling things togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which can no more be compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and mingled togither, then fire and
water: namely, the iustice of the gospell
with the iustice of the law. For it makes
a double iustification: the first containes
two parts, pardon of sinne by the death
of Christ, and the infused habit of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.
The second is by workes, which
(they say) do meritoriously increase the
first iustification and procure eternall
life. Here we see the soueraigne medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine
of the Gospel, namely remission of
sinnes, tempered with the poison of the
lawe. For though vertues and workes
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:3595:45"/>
prescribed in the lawe, haue their place,
as good giftes God, in our liues and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersations:
yet whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are set vp high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and brought within the circle of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification
as meritorious causes; they
are put quite out of their place, and are
no better then poison: and hereupon
are tearmed of Paul, losse and dongue.
But such as desire to be tearmed Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickes,
alleadge for themselues against
vs, that the obedience of Christ, that is,
the righteousnesse of an other cannot
possibly be our righteousnesse. I aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
that the iustice of another may be
our iustice, if it be really made ours.
And this is true in Christ. For when we
begin to beleeue in him, though our
persons remaine euermore distinct and
vnconfounded, yet are we made one
with him, and according to the tenour
of the Euangelicall couenant, are we gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to him, and he to vs: so as we may
truely say, Christ is mine, as we can tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
say, this house or this land is mine.
Now if Christ be ours, then also his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
is not onely his but ours also:
his, because it is in him: ours, because
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:3595:45"/>
with him it is giuen vs of God. Againe,
they alleadge, That when Paul refuseth
the righteousnesse of the lawe, he means
nothing els but the workes of the lawe,
that are perfourmed by the strength of
nature, and that he doth not exclude the
workes of Grace. I answer, it is false: for
he speakes of himselfe in the time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
when he was a Christian Apostle:
and therefore he excludes all righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of his own, which he had by the law,
euen when he was an Apostle. And the
obiection, Rom. 6. 1. <hi>what then shall we
sinne that grace may abound?</hi> cannot be
inferred vpon iustification by workes
of grace: but vpon a iustification by the
obedience of Christ imputed to vs,
without all workes of our owne.</p>
            <p>Againe, that we are iustified, not by
the iustice of the lawe, but by the iustice
of faith, here is the foundation of our
comfort. For hereupon, if we be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the time of this life, we may op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
against the tempter this our iustice.
If Satan plead against vs that we are sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and therefore subiect to eternall
damnation: let vs answere him, that the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:3595:46"/>
obedience of Christ hath freed vs from
this damnation. If he plead further, that
we neuer fulfilled the lawe; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
that we haue no right to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
life: we must answer him, that Christ
fulfilled the lawe for vs. If he shall vexe
and vpbraid vs with the consideration
of our manifold wants and corruptions;
let vs tell him, that, so long as we turne
vnto God from all our euill waies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile
our corrupttions, and beleeue in
Christ, all our wants are couered in his
obedience. Againe, if in the time of
death, the feare and apprehension of the
iudgement and anger of God terrifie vs,
we are to oppose this obedience of our
Mediatour, to the iudgement of God,
and to put it betweene Gods anger and
vs: yea we are to rest vpon it, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
and wrap our soules in it, and thus
to present them to God.<note place="margin">Isa. 4. 6.</note> Isai the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
saith, that the Messiah is <hi>a place of
refuge,</hi> shelter, or shade, <hi>against the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest</hi>
or burning heate of the wrath of
God.<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 25.</note> And Paul saith, <hi>he is our propitiato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie:</hi>
to signifie, that as the propitiatorie
couered the arke, and the lawe in the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:3595:46"/>
arke, which is the hand writing against
vs, from the presence of God: so Christ
couereth our sinnes, and puts himselfe
betweene vs and the indignation of his
father.</p>
            <p>The third and last point of doctrine
here deliuered by Paul is, <hi>That faith is
the</hi> meanes to receiue and to obtaine the
obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Christ for our iustice. That
this may the better be conceiued, foure
points are to be handled. What this faith
is? howe it is a meanes to obaine iustice?
whether alone by it selfe, or by the helpe
of other vertues? When and howe long
it is the onely meanes? For the first:
Faith is a speciall gift of God whereby
we beleeue Christ and his benefits to be
ours. In the first place I say, it is a gift of
God: because it comes wholly of God,
and not from the minde or will of man.
Thus Paul saith,<note place="margin">Phil. 1. 29.</note> 
               <hi>It is giuen you for Christ
to beleeue in him:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 24. 25.</note> and Christ our Sauiour
Saith to two of his disciples, <hi>O foolish
and sloe of heart to beleeue.</hi> If it be obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
that when we beleeue first, we then
beleeue willingly: I answere; it is so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede:
yet is not this willingnes in vs by
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:3595:47"/>
nature but by grace: because when God
giues vnto vs the gift of faith, he giues
vs also to will to beleeue. None comes
to Christ but he is drawne of the father:
and to be drawne is, when the vnwilling
will is chaunged, and by the power of
God made a willing will. I adde further,
that faith in the Messias is a speciall
gift, for two causes. First, because it is a
gift aboue not onely corrupted, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
aboue the first created nature. For it
was neuer in mans nature by creation.
Adam neuer had it: neither did the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
law reueale it vnto vs; because it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
knew this faith. Neuerthelesse other
vertues, as loue of God and man, feare
of God, &amp;c. are reuealed of the law, and
were in mans nature by creation. Again,
whereas all other gifts of God are giuen
to them that are ingrafted into Christ:
faith is giuen to them that<note n="a" place="margin">non insitis, sed inserendis.</note> are to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted:
because it is the ingrafting, and
therefore can not be giuen to them that
are alreadie in Christ, but to them that
are to be in Christ. Further, I say, that
by faith, we beleeue Christ and his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
to be ours. For this is the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:3595:47"/>
of faith, whereby it differs from all
other graces of God. When Thomas
had put his finger into the side of Christ
he said, <hi>My Lord, and my God:</hi> to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e
Christ replied:<note place="margin">Ioh. 20. 28, 29.</note> 
               <hi>Because thou hast seene,
thou hast beleeued.</hi> Where we see, that
this is faith, to beleeue Christ to be our
Lord &amp; our god. Paul saith, <hi>I liue by the
faith of Christ:</hi> now what he meanes by
faith,<note place="margin">Gal. 2. 20.</note> he shewes in the next words: <hi>who
hath loued ME and giuen himselfe FOR
ME.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any man shall demand, vpon what
grounds, (because we are not to goe by
imagination) I say, vpon what groundes
he is to conceiue a faith, that Christ is
his Christ: I answer, the groundes are
two. The first is the commandement of
God, to beleeue Christ and his benefits
to be ours, 1. Ioh. 3. 23. <hi>This is his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,
that ye beleeue in the name of
his sonne Iesus Christ.</hi> Now to beleeue in
Christ, is to put our confidence in him:
and we can put no confidence in him,
vnlesse we be first assured that he with
his benefits is ours. And whatsoeuer we
aske in praier,<note place="margin">Mar. 11. 24.</note> we are commaunded to
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:3595:48"/>
beleeue that it shall be giuen vnto vs.
Now aboue all things we are to aske
that Christ and his benefits may be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
vnto vs of God. This therfore must
we beleeue. The second ground is this:
We must consider the maner that God
vseth in propounding the promise of
grace vnto vs: for he doth not onely set
it forth vnto vs in a generall sort, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
he vseth meete and conuenient means
to applie it to the persons of men. First
of all, he confirmes it by oath, that we
our selues might the better applie it and
reape sure consolation thereby.<note place="margin">Hel. 6. 18.</note> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
God giueth vnto vs the spirit of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption;
which beareth witnes to our
consciences of such things as God hath
giuen vnto vs in particular, and are one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in generall manner propounded in
the promise. And this testimonie must
be certen in it selfe, and also plainely
knowne vnto vs; els is it no testimonie.
Thirdly both the Sacraments, are seales
of the promise: in the lawfull vse where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
God offers, yea exhibits Christ vnto
vs; and doth (as it were) write our names
within the promise, that we might not
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:3595:48"/>
doubt. Now then, looke as God giues
the promise, so must we by faith receiue
it. But God giues the promise, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
applies it: we therefore must receiue
the promise, and by faith applie it to
our selues. If any man shall say, that he
can not conceiue a speciall faith vpon
these groundes by reason of his vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe:
I answer, that he must striue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his vnbeleefe, and indeauour to
beleeue by desiring, asking, seeking,
knocking: and God will accept the will
to beleeue for faith it selfe, so be it there
be an honest heart touched with sorrow
for sinnes past, and a purpose to sinne
no more.</p>
            <p>That we may yet better know, what
faith is; vnderstand that there be two
kindes of false faith, like indeede to true
faith, and yet no faith at all. The first is,
when a man conceiues in his heart a
strong perswasion, that Christ is his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour,
and yet carries in the same heart a
purpose to sinne, and makes no change
or amendment of his life. This perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
is nothing but presumption, and a
counterfeit of true faith, whose proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:3595:49"/>
is to purifie the heart, and to shew it
selfe in the exercises of inuocation and
true repentance. The second is, when
men conceiue a strong perswasion, that
Christ is their Sauiour, and yet for all
this contemne and despise the Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of the word and sacraments. This al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
is an other counterfeit. For true faith
is conceiued, cherished, and confirmed
by the vse of the word &amp; sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. And
we must there seeke Christ, where God
will giue him vnto vs: now God giues
Christ in the word and sacraments; and
in them he doth as it were open his hand
&amp; reach forth all the blessings of Christ
vnto vs. We must not therefore ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
to finde Christ, where and how we
list; but we must seeke him in the word
and sacraments, and there must we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
him, if we desire to receiue him
aright.</p>
            <p>The second point to be considered
is, How faith is a meanes to iustifie? I
answer thus. Faith doth not iustifie as it
is an excellent worke of God in vs: for
then all vertues might be meanes of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,
as well as faith. It doth not
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:3595:49"/>
iustifie as it is an excellent vertue in it
selfe: because it is imperfect and ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with vnbeleefe. It doth not iustifie as
a meanes to prepare and dispose vs to
our iustification: for so soone as we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to beleeue in Christ, we are iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<note n="a" place="margin">Chrysost. hom. 7. in Rom. Quam primum homo credidit, confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stim simul iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficatus est.</note>without any disposition or prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
comming betweene faith and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification.
Lastly it doth not iustifie as
it containes in it all other vertues and
good workes, as the kernell containes
the tree with all his branches. For then
should it be a part, yea the principall
part of our iustice. Whereas Saint Paul
distinguisheth iustice and faith, saying,
that <hi>our righteousnes is of God vpon faith:</hi>
and not for faith, but, <hi>by faith.</hi> Now then
faith iustifies, as it is an Instrument or
hand to apprehend or recceiue the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
of Christ for ours; and this appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
is made, when we doe indeede
beleeue Christ and his benefits to be
ours. And least any should imagine,
that the very action of faith in appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
Christ, iustifieth: we are to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
that faith doth not apprehend
by power from it selfe, but by vertue of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:3595:50"/>
the couenant. If a man beleeue the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of France to be his, it is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his: yet if he beleeue Christ and the
kingdome of heauen by Christ to be
his: it is his indeede: not simply because
he beleeues, but because he beleeueth
vpon commandement and promise: for
in the tenour of the couenant, God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth
to impute the obedience of
Christ vnto vs for our righteousnes, if
we beleeue.</p>
            <p>The third point is, whether faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
be the meanes to obtaine the iustice
of Christ for vs or no? I answer, it is the
onely meanes without the helpe of any
other vertue or worke. For Paul here
teacheth, that faith apprehendeth Christ
for righteousnes, <hi>without the law:</hi> that is,
without any thing that the law requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
at our hands. And here by this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusiue
particle <hi>[without the law,]</hi> he tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
three things. The first, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
within vs is an efficient or merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
cause, either principall or lesse
principall, in whole or in part of our iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification
or reconciliation with God.
The second, that nothing within vs is an
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:3595:50"/>
instrument or meanes to applie the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
of Christ vnto vs, but faith
which is ordained of God to be an ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
to receiue the free fauour of God in the
merit of Christ. The third, that our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouation
or sanctification is no matter,
forme, or part of our iustification, but
that it wholly stands in the imputation
of the iustice of Christ. In a word, Paul
vtterly excludes all things that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
vs, whether by nature or by grace, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the act of iustificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: that in this article,
onely grace, onely Christ, onely faith,
onely mercie in pardon of sinne may
raigne. It may be here obiected, that
Abraham was iustified not by faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
but by workes, as S. Iames teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.
I answer, there is a double iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
one of the person whereby a man
of a sinner is made no sinner: the second
is the iustification of the faith of the
person, whereby faith is declared to be
true faith: and this second is by workes:
and of it S. Iames speaketh as appeareth
v. 18. where he saith, <hi>Shew me thy faith
by thy workes.</hi> And whereas he saith, that
<hi>Abraham our father was iustified by
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:3595:51"/>
workes,</hi> his meaning is that Abraham
by workes iustified himselfe to be a true
beleeuer, yea the father of all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full:
and his faith was made perfect by
workes, verse 22. that is, declared or iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
to be a true faith.</p>
            <p>The fourth or last point is, when and
howe long faith alone iustifieth? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
not onely in the beginning of our
conuersion, but also in the continuance,
and finall accomplishment thereof. For
here Paul desires in the day of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to stand before God onely by the
iustice of faith, without his owne iustice
of the lawe. And Paul brings in Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
(as I haue noted before) in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
middest of godly conuersation and
holy obedience to be iustified without
any workes by his faith in the Messias.<note place="margin">Rom. 4.</note>
And Paul auoucheth three things of
faith:<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 2.</note> by it <hi>we haue accesse</hi> to the grace
of God: by it we <hi>stand in the same grace:</hi>
by it we <hi>reioice vnder the hope of glorie.</hi>
Thus then, we see there is one onely
waie of iustification, namely that we are
iustified and accepted of God to life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
through grace alone, by faith
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:3595:51"/>
alone, for Christ alone in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
middle, and ende of our conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
And here is plainly discouered the
errour of the church of Rome. It makes
a double iustification: one whereby a
sinner is made of an euill man a iust ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>;
and this they say is by faith alone: the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
is, whereby a man of a iust man is
made more iust: and this (they say) is by
faith and workes togither: but falsely, as
I haue shewed.</p>
            <p>By all this which hath beene said, we
see howe righteousnesse comes by, and
vpon the faith of Christ. And hence we
learne, that it stands vs in hand to proue
whether we haue faith or no: because
where is no faith, there is no iustice. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
our dutie is to labour for such a
faith, that can and doth iustifie it selfe to
be true faith, by workes of loue to God
and men. Thirdly we must by this faith,
rest and wholly relie our selues on the
obedience of Christ both in life and
death: yea whatsoeuer doeth befall vs.
Though God should reach out his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
&amp; destroy vs, we must stil rest vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if our iustice be foorth of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:3595:52"/>
vs, and we must by faith trust God for
it: then much more must we trust him
for health, wealth, libertie, peace, foode,
and raiment, and for all the things of
this life. And if we cannot trust him in
the lesse, we shall neuer trust him in the
principall. Therefore it is our part to
walke in the duties of our callings, and
to obey God therein: &amp; for the successe
of our labours to trust him vpon his
word; yea when all worldly helpes and
succours faile, to trust in him still. If we
cannot trust him for our temporall life,
we shal neuer trust him for our saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
            <p>The second gaine which Paul desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
is fellowship with Christ in the 10.
verse. Where it is set forth first general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and then by his partes. Generally in
these wordes <hi>[That I may knowe him.]</hi>
Here it must be reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
is twofold, knowledge of faith, &amp;
of experience. Knowldge of faith is
to be assured of Christ and his benefits,
though it be against all humane reason,
hope, &amp; experience. Of this Paul saith,
<hi>It is eternall life to know thee the only God,
&amp;c.</hi> The knowledge of experience is to
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:3595:52"/>
haue a sense and feeling of our inward
fellowship with Christ, and vpon often
obseruation of his goodnesse to growe
more and more in experience of his
loue. Nowe this knowledge is here
meant, and not the first, which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mentioned verse 8. And therefore
Pauls desire is, that he may grow more
and more in holy experience of the end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
loue of God, and fellowship with
Christ.</p>
            <p>The partes of this desired communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
are two: fellowshippe with Christ in
his resurrection, and fellowshippe with
him in his death. The former is expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in these wordes, <hi>[and the vertue of
his resurrection.]</hi> And for the better co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing
of it, we are to consider what
the resurrection of Christ is? and what
is the vertue thereof? That the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of Christ may be rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued,
fiue points are to be skanned.
The first, touching the person of him
that rose: and that was Christ God and
man. Indeede properly the bodie alone
did rise, and not the soule or godhead,
yet by reason of the vnion of the two
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:3595:53"/>
natures in the vnitie of one person,
whole Christ arose, or God himselfe
made man arose. This commends vnto
vs the excellencie of Christs resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and makes it to be the foundation
vnto vs of our resurrection. The second
point is, For whome he rose? He rose
not as a priuate person for himselfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone:
but he rose in our roome &amp; stead,
and that for vs: so as when he arose, all
the elect arose with him, and in him.
Thus saith Paul, that the Fphesians
<hi>were raised togither with him.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 2. 6.</note> His resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
therefore was publike: and this
is the ground of our comfort. The third
point is, When he arose? He arose then,
when he lay in bondage vnder death, &amp;
that in the graue, which is as it were the
castle &amp; hold of death. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Peter saith,
<hi>that God loosed the sorrowes of death,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 2. 24.</note> he
signifieth that Christ was made captiue
for a time to the first death &amp; to the sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
of the second. Now in the midst of
this captiuity &amp; bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dage, he raised him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self:
&amp; this argues, that his resurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is a
ful victorie &amp; conquest ouer death and
all our spirituall enemies. The fourth
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:3595:53"/>
point is, That he rose by his own pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,<note place="margin">Ioh. 10. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>8.</note>
as he saith of himselfe, <hi>I haue power to
lay downe my life, and to take it vp againe.</hi>
If this had not bin, though he had risen
a thousand times by the power of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
he had not beene a perfect Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.
The last point is, Wherein sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds the
resurrection of Christ? Answer, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistes
in three actions of Christ. The
first is the revniting of his bodie to his
soule, both which were seuered for a
time, though neither of them were seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from the godhead. The second a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
is the change of his naturall life,
which he led in the estate of humiliatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
into a heauenly and spirituall life with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
infirmities, and not maintained by
food as before. For we finde not that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his resurrection he euer tooke meate
for necessitie, but onely vpon occasion,
to manifest the trueth of his manhood.
And this life he tooke vnto himselfe,
that he might conuey it to all that
should beleeue in him. The third action
is his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming forth of the graue; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
death it selfe did as it were acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
him to be a conquerour; and that
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:3595:54"/>
it had no title or interest in him. These
fiue things considered, the article of
Christs resurrection shall be rightly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood.</p>
            <p>Touching the vertue of Christs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
it is nothing els but the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of his god head, or the power of his
spirit, whereby he raised himselfe migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
from death to life, and that in our
behalfe. The excellencie of it may be
known by the effects, which be in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
eight. The first, that by it he shewed
himselfe to be the true and perfect Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
of the world. For it was foretolde
of the Messias that he should die &amp; rise
againe. Psal. 16. Matth. 12. And all this
was accordingly accomplished by the
vertue of Christs resurrection. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
effect is, that by it he shewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to be the true and naturall sonne
of god.<note place="margin">Rom. 1<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> Paul saith, <hi>He was declared migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
to be the sonne of God, by the spirit of
holinesse in his rising from the dead.</hi> The
third effect is, that by this vertue he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
himselfe to haue made a full and
perfect satisfaction for the sinnes of the
world. For if he had not satisfied to the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:3595:54"/>
full,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15. 17.</note> he had not risen againe. And Paul
saith, <hi>If Christ be not risen we are yet in our
sinnes.</hi> On the contrarie then, seeing he
is risen, such as beleeue in him, are not
in their sinnes.<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 34.</note> Againe: <hi>Who shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
vs? it is Christ which is dead, yea or
rather which is risen againe.</hi> The fourth
effect is iustification, as Paul testifieth:
<hi>He died for our sinnes, and rose againe for
our iustification,</hi> and that was on this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
When he was vpon the crosse, he
stood there in our roome, hauing our
sinnes imputed vnto him: and when he
rose from death he acquit and iustified
himselfe from our sinnes, and ceased to
be any more a reputed sinner for vs: and
thus, all that doe or shall beleeue in him,
are in him acquit, absolued, and iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from all their sinnes. If any demaund,
how they which liued in the time of the
old Testament, before the resurrection
of Christ, could be iustified thereby;
considering the effect must followe the
cause: I answer, that they were iustified
by the future resurrection of Christ:
which though it followed in time, yet
did the value &amp; vertue therof, reach eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:3595:55"/>
euen to the beginning of the world. The
fift effect, is the conferring and bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of all such gifts and graces as he had
merited &amp; procured for vs by his death
and passion. Thus Christ testifieth that
the giuing of the spirit in large &amp; plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
manner, was reserued to the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of Christ,<note place="margin">Ioh 7. 39.</note> which beganne in his
resurrection.<note place="margin">Luk. 24. 47.</note> And the preaching of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
and remission of sinnes is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
till after his resurrection. And S.
Peter saith,<note place="margin">1. Pet. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 3.</note> that the Elect are <hi>regenerate
to a liuely hope by the resurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Christ.</hi>
By reason of this bestowing of graces
and gifts, the resurrection of Christ is
the beginning of a new and spirituall
world, which the holy Ghost calls <hi>the
world to come,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 2. 5.</note> in which shall be a new
heauen and a new earth,<note place="margin">Isa. 65. 27.</note> as Isai speaketh,
and a peculiar people of God, zealous
of good works, keeping an eternall sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
vnto God. This one effect alone
sufficiently declares the excellencie of
this vertue of Christ. The sixth effect is
viuification, which is a raising of vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the death of sinne to newnes of life. And
the reason hereof is plaine. For Christ
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:3595:55"/>
in his resurrection put away his natural
life, which with our nature he receiued
from Adam, and tooke vnto him a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
life, that he might communicate
the saide life to all that beleeue in him.
Againe as the first Adam makes vs like
himselfe in sinne and death: so Christ
the second Adam renewes vs and makes
vs like to himselfe in righteousnes and
life. And the head quickned with spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
life will not suffer the members to
remaine in the death of sinne. The sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth
effect is to preserue safe &amp; sound
the gifts and graces, which he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
by his death; and bestowed on
them that beleeue: and this he doth by
the vertue of his resurrection. For to
this ende, hath he conquered all our spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
enemies, and doth by his power
conquer them still in vs; so as none shal
be able to take his sheepe out of his
hands. The last effect is, to raise the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
from the graue in the day of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to eternall glorie. If it be obiected,
that the wicked are also raised then by
the power of Christ:<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 1<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> I answer, that the
power of Christ is twofold. One is the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:3595:56"/>
power of iudgement, the other a power
of a Sauiour. By the first, Christ as a
iudge raiseth the vngodly, that he may
exequute on them the curse denounced
from the beginning of the world <hi>[at
what time thou shalt eate the forbidden
fruit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> 2. 7.</note> 
               <hi>thou shalt die the death.]</hi> The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
power is here tearmed the power
of Christs resurrection; and it belongs
to him as he is our Sauiour: and by it
will he raise to life eternall all those that
by the bond of the spirit, are mystically
vnited to him. For by meanes of this v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
this raising power shall flow from
the head to the dead bodies of them that
are in Christ. Thus we see, what the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
here mentioned is, and what Paul
desires, namely that he may haue expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
of these effects in himselfe.</p>
            <p>The vse of the doctrine followeth.
First of all, in that Christ rose for vs, and
in that his resurrection is of endlesse ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacie,
here is the foundation of all our
spirituall comfort. For by this vertue of
Christs resurrection fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> death to life, all
our spiritual enemies are conquered and
subdued, and by the said vertue doth he
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:3595:56"/>
daily more and more subdue them in vs.
Vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d said Christ: <hi>Ye shal haue
affliction in the world:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 16. 33.</note> 
               <hi>but be of good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
I haue ouercome the world.</hi> And this
victorie is for vs, and it is made ours by
our faith, as Iohn saith, <hi>This is the victorie
which ouer commeth the world,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 5. 4.</note> 
               <hi>euen your
faith.</hi> Art thou then terrified and afrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the conscience of thy sinnes,
with the crueltie of tyrants, the rage of
the world, the paines of hell, the pangs
of death, the temptations of the deuill;
be not dismaied, but by thy faith rest on
Christ that rose againe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> death to life
for thee, &amp; therby shewed himself to be
a rocke for thee to rest on, and to be the
lyon of the Tribe of Iuda: and thus
shalt thou finde certen remedie against
all the troubles and miseries of life and
death.</p>
            <p>Againe here we are taught to rise
with Christ from our sinnes, and to liue
vnto God in newnes of life: and for this
ende to pray that we may feele the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of Christs resurrection to chaunge
and renew vs. Great are the benefites
which we reape by this vertue, and we
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:3595:57"/>
are to shew ourselues thankfull to God
for them: which we can doe no way,
but by newnes of life. Againe the ende
why Christ rose for vs, was that we
might rise from our sinnes and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,<note place="margin">Rom 6. 4.</note>
in which we lie buried as in a
graue, to a new spirituall life. And the
reward is great to them that make this
happie change. For he that is <hi>partaker of
the first resurrection shall neuer see the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
death:</hi>

waies, shall certenly feele and indure
the second death. And further it must
be knowne, that the vertue of Christs
resurrection and the merit of his death,
are inseparably ioyned together: and
therefore he that findes not the vertue
of Christ to raise him to an holy and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
life acceptable to God, falsly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swades
himself of the merit of his death
in the remission of his sinnes. Christ by
rising put vnder his feete all our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and ledde captiuitie captiue euen
sinne it selfe. It is therefore a shame for
vs to walke in the waies of sinue, and to
make our selues slaues and captiues to
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:3595:57"/>
it. Christ by rising from death made
himselfe a principall leader and guide
to eternall life.<note place="margin">Act. 3. 25.</note> What wickednes then is
it to walke in the waies of our owne
heart, and not to 'follow this heauenly
guide. The care and purpose to keepe
a good conscience is a certen fruit and
effect of Christs resurrection.<note place="margin">2. Pet. 3. 21.</note> Thus S.
Peter saith, that the effect of our bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme
is the stipulation of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
by the resurrection of Christ.
Where the word which I translate, <hi>Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation,</hi>

signifies an interrogation vpon
an interrogation. For the Minister in
the name of God demandes, whether
we renounce the world, the flesh &amp; the
deuill, and take the true God for our
God. And we vpon this demaund, doe
further in our hearts demaund of God,
whether he will vouchsafe to accept vs
being wretched sinners for his seruants;
and thus we make profession of our
minde and desire. When Christ rose, by
the vertue of his resurrection, the earth
trembled, and thereby this bruit crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in his kinde professed his subiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and homage to Christ that rose a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:3595:58"/>
If then we beleeue, that Christ
rose from death for vs, much more
should our hearts tremble and we yeeld
our selues in subiection to him in all
spirituall obedience. Some man may
say, you bid vs rise from our sinnes, as
Christ rose to the glorie of his Father,
whereas this is wholly Gods worke in
vs, and not ours: I answer, it is so indeed:
yet can we vse the outward meanes of
hearing and reading; and if we haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
sparke of grace, we can aske and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
the spirit of God, that worketh this
in vs. Againe, exhortations, admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and such like, are meanes appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of God, whereby he worketh in vs
the thing which he requireth and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth.
Wherefore let vs listen to the
voice of Christ, <hi>Awake thou that sleepest,
stand vp from the dead,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 5. 14.</note> 
               <hi>and Christ shall
giue thee life.</hi> And worldly cares must
not hinder vs in this worke: for as Paul
saith,<note place="margin">Coloss. 3. 1.</note> they which are risen with Christ,
must seeke the things that are aboue.</p>
            <p>Againe here we are taught, that we
may not content our selues, if we know
Christ in the braine, and can speake
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:3595:58"/>
well of him with a glibbe tongue, we
must goe yet further, and by all meanes
labour, that we taste and feele by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
how good and sweete a Sauiour
Christ is vnto vs; that our hearts may
be rooted and grounded in his loue.
This is the thing which Paul aimed at:
which also we must seeke by all possible
meanes to attaine vnto.</p>
            <p>To proceede; that we may haue
right knowledge of our communion
with Christ in his death, two points are
to be handled. The first is, what are the
sufferings of Christ? I answer, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the sufferings which he indured in
his owne person, but also those which
are indured of his members.<note place="margin">Act. 9. 4.</note> Thus Saul
persequuting the church, is saide to
persequute Christ himselfe. And Paul
saith, that <hi>he fulfilled the rest of the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Christ in HIS OWNE FLESH.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Coloss. 1. 24.</note>
And whereas the Lord said of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Israel,<note place="margin">Hos. 11. 1.</note> 
               <hi>I haue brought my son out of
Egypt:</hi> it is applyed by Saint Matthew to
Christ himselfe. Yet here it must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred,
that if the members of Christ
suffer either ciuill or ecclesiasticall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:3595:59"/>
for euill doing; they are not
the sufferings of Christ. For when Saint
Peter had said,<note place="margin">2. Pet. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 13. 15.</note> 
               <hi>Reioice in that you are
partakers of the sufferings of Christ:</hi> he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
further, <hi>Let no man suffer as an euill
doe<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> opposing the one kinde of suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
to the other. Therefore our suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
are then to be accounted the suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
of Christ, when they are for good
cause, and for the name of Christ.</p>
            <p>For the seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d point, fellowship with
Christ in his death is either within vs or
without vs. That within vs is called the
mortification of the flesh or the cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
of the affections and the lustes
thereof. The other without vs, is the
mortification of the outward man by
manifold afflictions: and of this Paul
speakes in this place: and it may be thus
described out of this text. Fellowship
with Christ in his death: is nothing but
a conformitie in vs to his sufferings and
death. And it is a thing worthy our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
to search wherein standes this
conformitie. For in two respects there
is no conformitie betweene our suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
and the sufferings of Christ. For
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:3595:59"/>
first of all, God powred forth on Christ
the whole malediction of the law due to
our sinnes: and by this meanes shewed
vpon him iustice without mercie. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise
in our afflictions God mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
his anger,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.</note> &amp; in iustice remembers
mercie: because he laies no more vpon
vs, then we are able to beare. Secondly
Christs sufferings are a redemption &amp;
satisfaction to Gods iustice for our sins:
so are not ours: because before God we
stand but as priuate persons, &amp; for this
cause the sufferings of one man cannot
satisfie for an other: and there is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
betweene our sufferings &amp; the
glorie which shall be reuealed. And
Christ saith of himselfe,<note place="margin">Isa. 6 3. 3.</note> 
               <hi>I haue tread the
wine-presse alone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nowe this conformitie standes (as I
take it) properly in the manner of suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring;
and that in foure things. First of al,
Christ suffered for a iust and righteous
cause: for he suffered as our redeemer,<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 10.</note>
the righteous for the vnrighteous. And
so must we likewise suffer for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes
sake.<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2. 21.</note> Secondly Christ in suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
was a myrrour of all patience and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:3595:60"/>
meeknesse. And we in our sufferings
must shewe the like patience. And that
we be not deceiued herein, our patience
must haue three properties. It must be
voluntarie, that is, we must willingly
and quietly renounce our owne wills,
and subiect our selues in our suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
to the will of God. Patience per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
is no patience. Againe it must not
be mercenarie, that is, we must suffer
not for bie respects, as for praise, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
but for the glorie of God, and that
we may shewe our obedience to him.
Hence it appeares that the patience of
the papist, that suffers in way of satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
is no right patience. Lastly our
patience must be constant. If we endure
afflictions for a brunt, and afterwarde
beginne to grudge and repine casting
off the yoke of Christ, we faile in our
patience. Further, if it be demaunded,
whether the affections of griefe &amp; sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe
may stand with patience: I answer
yea: for Christian religion doth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolish
these affections, but onely mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
them, and bring them in subiection
to the will of God, when we lie vnder
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:3595:60"/>
the crosse. The third point wherein
standes our conformitie with the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
of Christ is this:<note place="margin">Heb. 5. 8.</note> Christ learned
obedience by the things which he suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
not because he was a sinner, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
beeing righteous he had experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of obedience. And we likewise in
our sufferings must be more carefull to
take the fruit thereof, then to haue them
taken away. And the fruite of them is to
learne obedience thereby, specially to
the commandements of faith and repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
When Iob was afflicted of God,
not for his sins, but that he might make
a triall of his faith and patience,<note place="margin">Iob. 42. 6.</note> he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse
in the end tooke an occasion
thereby to renewe his olde repentance.
And Paul saith, that he receiued in his
owne flesh the sentence of death,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 1.</note> that
he might learne by faith to trust in god
alone. Lastly Christs sufferings were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to death it selfe:<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 4.</note> euen so must we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
sinne, fighting against it to the shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of our blood. Faith and good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
are things more pretious then
the very blood of our hearts: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if neede be, we must conforme our
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:3595:61"/>
selues to Christ, euen in the paines of
death.</p>
            <p>This is that conformitie of which
Paul here speaks of, which also he mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
as a speciall gaine. And there be
many reasons thereof. For first of all
this conformitie is a marke of Gods
child.<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 7.</note> For <hi>if we obediently endure afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
God in them, &amp; by them, <hi>offers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
as a father vnto vs.</hi> Secondly, it is a
signe that the spirit of God dwelleth in
vs:<note place="margin">1. Pet. 4. 14.</note> as Peter saith, <hi>If ye be railed vpon for
the name of Christ, the spirit of glory and of
God resteth vpon you.</hi> Thirdly, the grace
of God is most of all manifested in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,
in which God seemes most of
all in mans reason to withdrawe his
grace. <hi>Gods power is made manifest in
weakenesse.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 12. 9.</note> 
               <hi>Afflictions bring foorth pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:</hi>
not of themselues, but because then
the loue of God is shed abroad in our
heartes.<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 5.</note> Hope of eternall life sheweth it
selfe most in the patient bearing of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions.<note place="margin">15. 4.</note>
In peace and ease naturall life
raignes. Contrariwise in our sufferings
naturall life decaies, and the spirituall
life of Christ apparently shewes it selfe.
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:3595:61"/>
Lastly, this conformitie with Christ,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 4. 1<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> is
the right and beaten way to eternal life.
<hi>By many tribulations we must enter into
the kingdome of heauen.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 14. 2. Tim. 2. <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> That we may
raigne and liue with Christ, we must
first die with him. The estate of humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
is the way to the estate of exaltati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and glorie, first in him and then in
vs.</p>
            <p>The vse of this doctrine followes.
Here we see what for this life is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of all true beleeuers: namely, that
after they are made partakers of Christ
and his benefits, by the vertue of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,
they must also be made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
to his death. The commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of our Sauiour Christ to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that
wil be his disciples is,<note place="margin">Luk. 9. 23.</note> 
               <hi>To denie themselues
and to take vp their owne crosses euery day.</hi>
And there be three waightie causes, why
God will haue it so.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 12. 1. Cor. 1<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> The one, that he
may correct sinnes past: the other, that
he may preuent sins to come: the third,
that he may proue what is in our hearts.
Secondly we learne by this which hath
bin said, to comfort our selues in our
sufferings. For in them Christ and we
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:3595:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are partners, and he vouchsafes to make
vs his fellowes. Hence it followes that
all our afflictions are well knowne to
Christ, and that they are laid on vs with
his consent: and for this cause we should
frame our selues to beare them with all
meekenes. And hence againe we learne,
that he beeing our partner, will helpe vs
to beare them, either by moderating the
waight of them, or by ending them for
our good. Lastly, here we learne that
our afflictions are either blessings or
benefits: and such may we discerne them
to be, though not by the light of reason,
yet by the eie of faith: because they are
meanes to make vs conformable to our
head Christ Iesus. Benefits of God are
of two sorts, positiue and priuatiue. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitiue,
whereby God bestowes somthing
on vs. Priuat<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> whereby God takes away
a blessing, and couertly giues another.
Benefits of this kind be afflictions. Of
the twaine, these are the rifer for the
time of this life: and the other for the
life to come. And therefore while we
liue in this worlde, our dutie is with
Paul to labour to attaine to this confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:3595:62"/>
with the sufferings of Christ, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
vpon any occasion we shall be afflicted:
for then shall we be fashioned like vnto
him, and reape much comfort there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.</p>
            <p>Thus much of the second gaine:
nowe followes the third in these words,
<hi>[If by any meanes, I may attaine to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
of the dead.]</hi> The word resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
here signifies the reward of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
life; the antecedent beeing put
for the consequent. For to rise againe of
it selfe is no gaine, considering it is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
both to good and badde, but eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
life that followes, is the reward. And
the forme of speech, <hi>[if by any meanes]</hi>
doth not signifie or imply any doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in Paul of his owne resurrection to
life:<note place="margin">Rom 8. 2. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>im. 1. 12.</note> for he was perswaded that nothing
should seperate him from Christ: and it
is an article of our and Pauls faith, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
the resurrection of the bodie to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
life. Wherefore it signifies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
a difficultie to obtaine the gaine
desired: and an earnest affection in Paul
to obtaine the same. And when he saith,
<hi>[By any meanes,]</hi> we must knowe that
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:3595:63"/>
there be three waies or meanes to come
to eternall life. One is by peaceable life
and death: the other is by a life lade<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with
many afflictions, the third is by a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
cruell, and bloody ende. And Pauls
mind and desire is, to obtain the crowne
of eternall glorie by any of these waies:
and if not by the first or second, yet by
the third.</p>
            <p>In these wordes foure things are to
be considered. The first is the gaine it
selfe, and that is, the Reward of eternall
glorie. And that we may the more with
Paul be stirred vp to a desire thereof, I
will stand a while to declare the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie
and the conditions of it. It is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
els but a certaine estate of life, in
which all the promises of God are in &amp;
by Christ accomplished vnto vs in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.
And it will the better be conceiued
by the answering of three questions:
What shall ceafe in this estate? What we
shall haue? What we shall doe?</p>
            <p>For the first, seauen things shal cease.
The first is the Exequution of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorship
of Christ, or of the offices of
a king, priest, prophet. Thus much tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:3595:63"/>
Paul,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 15. 24.</note> when he saith, that Christ in
the last daie <hi>must giue vp his kingdome to
his father.</hi> And though the exequution
shall then cease: yet nothing shall be
wanting to them that beleeue: because
then shall be the full and eternall fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all the benefits of our redemptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
Secondly, then shall cease all callings in
familie, church, and common wealth:
because Christ shall then put downe all
power,<note place="margin">Ibid. v. 24.</note> rule, and authoritie. In this bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
estate, there shall not be magistrate
and people, master &amp; seruant, husband
and wife, parents and children, pastor
and people: but all such outward distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of persons shal cease, and we shall
be as the angels of God. Thirdly all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
that pertaine to vs, as we are pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimes
here vpon earth, shall haue an
end, as faith, hope, patience: because the
things beleeued and hoped for shall
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be obtained. Withall that part of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation
called Petition, shall cease, as
also the preaching and hearing of the
word and the vse of sacraments.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 13. 13<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> The
fourth thing that shall cease is originall
sinne with the fruites thereof: because
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:3595:64"/>
no vncleane thing may enter into the
heauenly Hierusalem.<note place="margin">Rev. 21. 4.</note> Fiftly, then shall
cease all miseries, and sorrowes, all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities
of bodie and mind: for then all
defects of eies, armes, and legges, shall
be restored. The fixt thing that shall
cease is naturall life with the meanes
thereof, as meate, drinke, clothing, phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke,
recreation. For then our bodies
shall be spirituall, that is, immediately &amp;
eternally preserued by the operation of
the spirit of God, as nowe the bodie of
Christ is in heauen. The last thing to be
abolished is the vanitie of the creatures,
specially of heauen and earth: which i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
the last iudgement shal againe be resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to their former excellency.<note place="margin">Act. 3. 21.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The second question is, what we shal
haue and inioye in this estate? I answer,
three things. The first is, immediate and
eternal fellowship with God the father,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 28.</note>
sonne, and holy ghost. For in this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
estate the tabernacle of God shall
be with men,<note place="margin">Rev. 21. 3.</note> as Saint Iohn saith: &amp; God
shall be all things that heart can wish to
all the elect.<note place="margin">Serm. de Temp. 148.</note> Augustine saith notably:
<hi>There shall be exceeding peace in us, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:3595:64"/>
vs, and with God himselfe. Because
we shall see him and inioy him alwaies and
euery where. Therefore blessed shall that
life be, for the thing which we shall inioy: for
we shall inioy God himselfe. For the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of inioying him: for we shall inioy him
by himselfe, all other meanes ceasing. For
the measure of our inioying him: for we
shall fully inioy him. For the time: for we
shall eternally inioy him. For the certenty,
whereby we shall knowe that it shall be so.
For the place: for we shall inioy him in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.
Lastly for the companions ioyned with
vs: for they shall be the elect.</hi> From this
fruition of God shall arise endlesse and
vnspeakable ioy. Psal. 16. 11. <hi>In thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
is fulnesse of ioy, at thy right hand are
pleasures for euermore.</hi> In the Transfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guration
of Christ, which was but a sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of the eternall glorie, Peter was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uished
with ioy &amp; delight: the ioy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
which shal be in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> must needs
be vnspeakable.<note place="margin">Mat. 17.</note> The seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d thing which
shall be inioyed is <hi>Glory both</hi> in minde
and bodie. In mind, because we shall the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
be partakers of the Diuine not essence
(for then we should be deified) but na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:3595:65"/>
that is, diuine vertues and qualities,
more excellent then those which God
bestowed on Adam,<note place="margin">2. Pet. 1. 4.</note> though of the
same kinde. The glory of the body is to
be changed and made like the glorious
body of Christ. The third thing is, <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion</hi>
and Lordship ouer heauen and
earth; which Lordship once lost by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
shal then fully be restored. He that
ouercommeth <hi>shall possesse all things.</hi>

                  </gap>. 21.</note>
Reu. 21. 7.</p>
            <p>The third question is, what we shall
doe? I answer briefly, keepe an eternall
sabbath in praising of God, and giuing
thanks vnto him. And thus by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of these things, we may take
a taste of the excellencie of this third
and last gaine.</p>
            <p>The second point here to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
is the difficultie of obtaining this
desired gaine of eternall life. And the
reason is plaine. For the way to eternall
life is full of impediments, which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
to foure heads. First of all in this
way we are to fight, not with flesh and
blood,<note place="margin">Eph. 6. 13.</note> but with principalities and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
in spirituall things, seeking the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:3595:65"/>
of our soules. Secondly there
be within vs innumerable lusts that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
vs round about, presse vs downe,
and draw vs away to the broad way of
destruction.<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 1. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>am. 1. 14.</note> Thirdly this way lies full
of offences, partly in doctrines, partly
in euill examples; all tending to this
ende, either to make vs fall, or to goe
out of the way.<note place="margin">Ro<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 1. 8. 35.</note> Lastly it is beset with
manifold tribulations, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to the ende. Hence we learne, that
we must giue all diligence that we may
attaine to the reward of glorie: and
therefore we must struggle,<note place="margin">Mat. 7. 13.</note> striue, and
wrastle to enter in at the straight gate.
The principall gaine, and the hardnes
to obtaine it, requires our principall
studie and labour. Therefore they deale
wickedly, that vse no meanes, but (as
they say) leaue all to God, thinking it
the easiest matter in the world, to winne
the kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The like is their
fault, that professe religion in a slacke
and negligent manner, beeing neither
whot nor cold.</p>
            <p>The third point, is Pauls minde and
desire of eternall life. If it be saide, that
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:3595:66"/>
wicked men haue the like desire, as for
example Balaam: I answer, in Paul
there was an indeauour answerable to
his desire, as appeares act. 24. 16. where
he saith, <hi>That he waited for the resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the iust and vniust:</hi> and that in the
meane season <hi>he laboured to keepe a good
conscience before God and men:</hi> now this
desire in the vngodly is barren, and
yeeldes not his fruit. Againe Paul bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
iustified, still desires to attaine to
full fellowship with Christ, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie
with him in glorie. The like
desire, with the like indeauour, should
be in vs.</p>
            <p>The last point, is Pauls courage and
fortitude. He is content to indure any
kinde of death, yea cruell death, so he
may obtaine this third and last gaine.
And thus it is verified, which he saith,
<hi>that God</hi> had giuen him <hi>the spirit not of
fearefulnes but of courage.</hi>

                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. Tim. 1. 7.</note> Like was the
courage of Moses, who was content to
indure afflictions with the people of
God, that he might winne the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of reward.<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 26.</note> Like was the courage
of the martyrs, <hi>that were racked &amp; would
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:3595:66"/>
not be deliuered,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> 
               <hi>that they might obtaine a
better resurrection.</hi> We likewise walking
in the way to eternall life, must take the
like courage vnto vs in all dangers. For
this cause we must pray vnto God, to
giue vs the spirit of courage: and we
must alwaies attende vpon the calling
and commaundement of God, making
it the stay and foundation of our cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage:
and we must yet further stay our
selues on the promise of Gods presence
and protection, so long as we obay him.
If it be alledged, that we are by nature
fearefull in daungers, and therefore vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of courage: I answer, there is a
threefold feare. The first is feare of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
when mans nature feares, flies, and
eschewes that which is hurtfull vnto it.
This feare was in Christ, whose soule
was heauie vnto death,<note place="margin">Heb. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> who also feared
the cursed death which he indured.
And therefore this feare of it selfe is no
sinne, and it may stand with true forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.
The second feare is that which ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
of the corruption of nature, when
a man feares without cause, or without
measure. Without cause, as when the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:3595:67"/>
Disciples feared Christ walking vpon
the sea: or when they feared drowning,
Christ lying asleepe in the shippe.
Without measure, as when men distru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
God, neglect their callings in time
of daunger, and the dutie of inuocation,
flying to vnlawfull meanes of deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.
Now this seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d feare is an enemy
vnto all true courage. The third feare
is, when perils and death are indeede
feared: but yet feare is ordered by faith
in the mercie and prouidence of God,
by hope, by inuocation; and it is ioyned
with obedience to God in the time of
daunger. This is a proceeding of grace,
and it may well stand with courage, and
it serues to order the two former feares,
the one of nature, the other of distrust.</p>
