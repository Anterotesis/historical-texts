         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

that the ſaid Memorial be again ſomewhat
afreſh reiterated, the aforeſaid Regents of the <hi>Eaſt-India
Netherlands</hi> Company will, with Permiſſion of
your Puiſſant Highneſſes, make a ſhort Recital; Firſt,
of what in the beginning was done here in <hi>Holland</hi> by
Conference and Treaties, and alſo afterwards conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued,
and further Progreſs thereof made in <hi>England</hi>
by the Lord Ambaſſador <hi>Citters,</hi> according to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
given him by your Puiſſant Highneſſes; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
of the Proceedings held in <hi>England</hi> by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees
on both ſides, and what further was acted in
the ſame; and ſo come to the Principal Matter, to
demonſtrate as briefly as poſſibly may be, how unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable,
and wholly ungrounded thoſe Complaints are,
which in the beginning were ſo clamorous: and then
will fully juſtifie the Government of <hi>Batavia</hi> in their

            <p>What concerns the firſt, Mr. <hi>Chudlie,</hi> Extraordinary
Envoy, by his Memorial of the <hi>25th.</hi> of <hi>May</hi> of the
aforeſaid Year 1683, complained to your Puiſſant
Highneſſes, that the Government of <hi>Batavia</hi> had in a
manner altogether extraordinary outragiouſly dealt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
with the <hi>Engliſh Eaſt-India</hi> Company, and by main
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95727:3"/>
force driven them out of their ancient Place of Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
at <hi>Bantam;</hi> and that in ſo ſtrange a manner,
that not any one Example (a thing rather to be buried
in ſilence, than related) of the like nature can be
produced: And therefore requiring that the ſaid <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlandiſh</hi>
Company ſhould be obliged to draw back
their Troops out of <hi>Bantam,</hi> re-eſtabliſhing the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
there again, and to make Reparation of the Loſſes by
them ſuſtained. But Sir <hi>John Chardin</hi> beforementioned,
who by the foreſaid <hi>Engliſh Eaſt-India</hi> Company was

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nt hither in Commiſſion, did ſomewhat mitigate
theſe Complaints, apparently, becauſe they were ſo
horrible Extravagant: And inſtead of accuſing the
Government of <hi>Batavia,</hi> as if they had driven the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> out of <hi>Bantam,</hi> did content himſelf to ſay,
that it happened through the Suggeſtion and Counſel
of Major St. <hi>Martin,</hi> who commanded the <hi>Netherlandiſh</hi>
Troops at <hi>Bantam</hi> in Chief, and that it was he that
d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

And although all he affirmed was without any
Proof, but only grounded on a Conjecture; yet that
which is to be wondred at, is, that he would form a
Publick Memorial on ſo ſlight and weak Grounds.</p>
            <p>And although the Bewinthebbers were at that time
infurniſhed with ſuch Elucidation of Matters as is

Company at <hi>London;</hi> notwithſtanding they omitted
not, according to the knowledg they had attained, to

having given an Anſwer to the ſaid <hi>Chudlie</hi> and
<hi>Chardin</hi> (unto which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company in ſome

the good liking of your Puiſſant Highneſſes, a Treaty
began with the forenamed <hi>Chardin</hi> and the <hi>Netherlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh</hi>
Company; and the Buſineſs was ſo far advanced,
that on both ſides a final Agreement was aſſuredly
expected, whereas on a ſudden Mr. <hi>Chudlie</hi> and Sir
<hi>John Chardin</hi> pretending to have Command and Order
from their King, to put a ſtop to the Buſineſs, the
aforeſaid Treaties here was unexpectedly broken off<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

continued in <hi>England;</hi> whereunto the Lord Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
<hi>Citters</hi> was furniſhed with full Order and Power
both from your Puiſſant Highneſſes, as alſo from the
Company here: But hereupon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> hightning
their Demands, and as appeared afterward even in their
Reply, of which ſhall be ſpoken hereafter, they avowed
to have other Deſigns, intending to re-eſtabliſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
at <hi>Bantam;</hi> unto which end in the latter part of
the Year 1683, they prepared a great Fleet well
manned, to effect the ſame; but this their Deſign, as
themſelves affirm, and complain that they might not
put it in Execution, as being hindred by the now
deceaſed King, of happy Memory; Hereupon this
Treaty was ſtopt, and no further Progreſs made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
until at length it pleaſed his ſaid Majeſty to make
way for the proſecuting of the Agreement preſcribed
<hi>Anno</hi> 1674, between his Majeſty and this State; to
wit, That the Differences ſhould be determined and
compoſed by Committees on both ſides, who to that
end, according to the aforeſaid Convention, were to
aſſemble together at <hi>London:</hi> The which being alſo
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95727:4"/>
approved by your Puiſſant Highneſſes, there was
erected a Tribunal Court, conſiſting of Eight Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees,
Four on each part; before whom, after that
the Parties on both ſides had divers times appeared
about the Praeliminaries and Caſes incident, it was
thought meet, that all things ſhould be handled in
Writing, and the State of the Caſe ſo written, to be
made by Demand, Anſwer, Reply, and Duplick (or
double Reply) even to a Triplick and Quadruplick:
And beſides all this, there were delivered up ſuch pieces
Probatory, as might ſerve to fortifie and maintain the
Caſe on the one hand, with the Confutation of the
ſame on the other hand; they of the <hi>Netherlandiſh</hi>
Company alſo making their Demand againſt the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and delivering the ſame over by
way of Reconvention or contrary Demand, for the
fraighting of four Ships, wherewith the <hi>Netherlandiſh</hi>
Company, upon the earneſt Requeſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Company, had accommodated them, amounting to
thirteen thouſand nine hundred pounds <hi>Sterling:</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch
that the aforeſaid Pieces being delivered to the
ſaid Committees to do Right therein, the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Commiſſaries in their Vote declared, that it was their
Opinion and Sentence, that inſtead of all what was
demanded by the <hi>Engliſh Eaſt-Indie</hi> Company (to wit,
not only the recalling of the <hi>Netherlandiſh</hi> Troops out
of <hi>Bantam,</hi> and the Territories thereof, but moreover
and above, to deliver up the Caſtle and City of <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam.)</hi>
The <hi>Netherlandiſh</hi> Company was only bound to

But the Committees of this State delivering in their
Advice, every one of them in order did underſtand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and declare, that foraſmuch as the deciſion of the Caſe,
which muſt be judicially determined, did depend upon
the Verity of Fact, which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company had
charged the <hi>Netherlandiſh</hi> Company with, and in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
that the ſaid <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company were by them driven
out of <hi>Bantam,</hi> of which they could not produce the

ought to have their Demand and Concluſion made,

them; and the ſaid <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
to ſatisfie the <hi>Netherlandiſh</hi> Company for the
Fraighting of the four Ships which they demand by
reconvention: By which, becauſe of the ceſſation of
Voices, the Caſe being fallen into the Terms which
they were in according to the convention of Agreement
of the Year 1673-74, muſt come into the hands of an
Arbitrator or Compromiſſarius, to the chooſing of
whom by the aforeſaid Agreement, the time of a
Mouth was preſcribed. But the ſaid Committees for
the Deciſion on both ſides, not agreeing; for although
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company were Plantiff in Convention,
yet the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commiſſaries did not propoſe a Super-Arbitrator:
ſo hereby the whole Caſe, according to
an Act paſſed and ſubſcribed on both ſides, was left
in the Hands of his ſaid Majeſty and your Highneſſes,
to be determined by you, according to the Contents
of the aforeſaid Agreement. And this is the Reaſon
why the ſaid Mr. <hi>Skelton,</hi> Envoy Extraordinary, made
the aforeſaid Memorial and Addreſs to your Puiſſant

two Years after the Young King was come unto the

the ſaid Letter, that they did with Joy underſtand,
that God Almighty had brought, and inveſted him

the Kingdom of <hi>Bantam,</hi> with the good Will of his

            <p>And furthermore, His Majeſty of <hi>Great Brittain</hi> ſent
away the ſaid Ambaſſadors with Preſents to the Young
King their Maſter, accompanied with an Honourable
Letter to him; all which in the Proceſs is produced,
and in which he is ſtiled the Famous and Illuſtrious
Sultan <hi>Abdul Cahar Aba Naſar,</hi> King and Lord of the

moreover, That his Majeſty received the aforeſaid
Ambaſſadors with all due Reſpect, according to their
Character, and with entire Affection, as coming from
a Prince, whoſe Perſon and Amity his Majeſty declared
to have in very high Eſteem, and unto whom he
judged it neceſſary to ſend over his Agent or Envoy,
furniſhed with power from his Majeſty, and order
from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company, for to make a ſtricter
League with the King of <hi>Bantam;</hi> which Teſtimony
and Proffer of Alliance was yet further reiterated in
another Letter, writ by the aforeſaid <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company
from <hi>London</hi> the <hi>17th. July</hi> 1682, alſo produced in
the Proceſs. By all which then it appeareth undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
unto all that are Impartial, that the preſent King
now ruling, was acknowledged both by the King of
<hi>Great Brittain,</hi> and by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company, as well in
<hi>England,</hi> as in <hi>India,</hi> for the Lawful Lord and King of

But foraſmuch as the preſent King, in the direction
of the Affairs of the Kingdom, did not, as it ſeems,
anſwer the Expectation of his Father, nor ſatisfie the
Humour of many of his Subjects, there aroſe a heavy
Civil War in the Kingdom, in which the Malcontend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
intended to caſt off the Yoke from their Neck, as
they termed it, after they had alſo drawn the Old
King to their Party: who thereupon ſtrengthened
himſelf in <hi>Turtiaſſa</hi> (as alſo the King now reigning did
at <hi>Bantam.)</hi> At length by force of Arms they made

to bereave him both of his Throne and Life, and

Enemies, thought it Expedient for him to make known
to the General of the Council of the <hi>Netherlandiſh</hi>
Company at <hi>Batavia,</hi> his Miſerable State, and that he
not only was to expect the loſs of the Crown, but
alſo a moſt Cruel Death: The which he ſignified in
moſt lamentable wiſe, imploring their Aſſiſtance: But
they not judging it convenient in a caſe of ſuch Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
to intrude themſelves too unadviſedly, did,
before they determined any thing in the leaſt about it,
conclude to interpoſe their Mediation betwixt Father
and Son, and to that end to ſend Ambaſſadors with
Letters tending to that Purpoſe: But the Father in a
moſt diſdainful manner rejecting the ſame, without
vouchſafing to return any Anſwer at all to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of <hi>Batavia,</hi> or their Committees, the ſaid
Government did at laſt reſolve, ſeeing the Condition
of the Son tending to Ruin, as being forſaken almoſt
by all, to aſſiſt him againſt the Rebels, and if poſſible,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95727:7"/>
to deliver him out of the miſerable State into which he
was brought; which alſo they did with ſuch Succeſs,
that notwithſtanding the ſtrong Oppoſition of the
Enemy, we landed our Forces, raiſed the Siege of
the Caſtle in which the King was, and ſet him again
upon his Throne; who thereupon, both to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
how greatly he was offended with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi>
who had aſſiſted his Enemies, as alſo to provide for
his own Security for the Future, did, without any
Inſtigation of the <hi>Netherlandiſh</hi> Company, command
them to leave his Country, and to depart elſewhere
with their Goods. This then being a True Narration
of what paſſed in theſe Affairs, theſe Conſiderable
Things do preſent themſelves to Conſideration.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That the Old King having made over his
Kingdom to his Eldeſt Son, he thereby became Lawful
King by his Father's Tranſport, and was acknowledged
ſo to be by the King of <hi>Great Brittain,</hi> and by them of
the <hi>Engliſh Eaſt-Indie</hi> Company.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That he thereby being Lawful King,
his Subjects in taking up Arms againſt him, were
Rebels.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That according to the Law of Nature and
of Nations, it is not only permitted, to be Aſſiſtant
unto a King that is oppreſſed by his Subjects, but
that ſuch Aſſiſtance is approveable, and a Work of
Charity and Love.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That it is contrary to the Rule of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
to aſcribe the evil Conſequences of a Lawful and
Worthy Act, unto him that is the Author of the ſaid
Act, and no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of the Conſequences.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, That it is altogether againſt Reaſon, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
the Chaſing of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> out of <hi>Bantam,</hi> unto
them of the Government of <hi>Batavia,</hi> and to their
Auxiliary Forces; becauſe it is manifeſt, that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95727:7"/>
of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> out of <hi>Bantam</hi> was not a Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,
but an Accidental Conſequence; the King not
cauſing them to depart becauſe he was Victorious (for
he had ſuffered them to live there from the time he
came to the Crown until the War, to wit, during
the two years of his Reign) but only becauſe he was
certain they had aſſiſted his Rebels, beſides many
other Suſpitions he might juſtly have taken up againſt
them.</p>
            <p>But againſt this, they of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company do
alledge, and depoſe for a real Truth, That they of
<hi>Batavia</hi> had raiſed and fomented the Quarrels between
the Old and the Young King of <hi>Bantam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That two years before the War began, they had had
ſecret Negotiation with <hi>Pangeran Diepa Panerat,</hi> one of
the Principal Miniſters of the Young King, to bring
about this their Deſign.</p>
            <p>That they afterward, having got this King into their
Snares, and moſt perfidiouſly brought him under their
Yoke, forthwith forced him to drive out the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to make the Miniſters of the <hi>Netherlandiſh</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
yet the more ſuſpected and ſtinking to all the
World, they undertook in the beginning of the Year
1683, to repreſent unto the King of <hi>Great Brittain</hi>
that the foreſaid Major St. <hi>Martin,</hi> who commanded
over the Forces of the <hi>Netherlandiſh</hi> Company at <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>
in chief, had committed very many Enormities a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Factors, People, and the Effects of the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Company at <hi>Bantam;</hi> ſo far, that they diſpoſſeſſed,
and drave them out of their place of Reſidence: But
inſtead that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company ought to have proved
the Facts which are Eſſential to the Thing, in caſe
they herein aimed to Triumph, they do not in the
whole product which they made in the Proceſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95727:8"/>
ſo much as alledge the leaſt appearance, either
directly or indirectly, no, not ſo much as conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
might ſerve for the verifying of the Enormities
of ſuch Facts.</p>
            <p>And although the <hi>Netherlandiſh</hi> Company might
ſtand upon the Negative, which is not neceſſary, nay,
many times poſſible to be proved, ſave only indirectly
(for no man can in a direct manner prove that which
is not) nevertheleſs to manifeſt clearly that they of the
Government of <hi>Batavia</hi> are altogether blameleſs, let
us only conſider the moral Impoſſibility of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
Fact, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Governors of <hi>Batavia</hi> ſhould
have raiſed and fomented the Queſtions and Differences
between the Father and the Son; as alſo the notorious
Falſhood of the ſecond Fact, namely, That the ſaid
Government ſhould have forced the King to cauſe the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> to depart out of <hi>Bantam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What concerns the firſt, It's known to the World,
that for a long time there had been no good Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
between the Old King, and the Government
of <hi>Batavia;</hi> no, not ſo much as to the leaſt Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence:
For the latter finding themſelves much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted
and injured, inſomuch that at laſt they took
up Arms againſt each other, the War not ending,
until the Son came to the Crown: ſo that they could
not ſtir up the Son againſt the Father, much leſs fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
their Quarrel.</p>
            <p>And what Folly would it have been for them of
<hi>Batavia,</hi> to animate the Father to War againſt the
Son, foraſmuch as they lived with the Son in Amity,
and as Good Neighbours, not having any Reaſon in
the leaſt to complain of his Government and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
towards them; whereas on the contrary, if the
Father had got the upper hand, they ſhould have been
in a far worſe Condition, and attracted a new Enemy
againſt themſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:95727:8"/>
And that they ſhould have ſtirred up the Son againſt
the Father, and encouraged him to War, cannot be
imagined by any that are in their right Sences; partly
becauſe thereby they could not expect any Profit or
Advantage; or if they had, it would have been mixt
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ith an uncertainty as to the Event. And again, the
Son would then have endeavoured to have been afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>

and the firſt Aggreſſor; whereas on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>y,
it was the Father, who thereby got ſo great
Advantage over the Son, burning and ruinating the

kindle the Fire and foment this War? Eſpecially here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
concurring, that they were ſo ſoon ready to
joyn their Forces to the Aſſiſtance of the Father, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which the Father could not have obtained thoſe
Advantages, nor the Son be brought to ſuch a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinth.</p>
            <p>Alſo it will clearly appear, that all the Miſchief
which is come to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company in this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
is wholly from the bad Management of Affairs
by their own Men and Miniſters in <hi>Bantam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the King of <hi>Great Brittain,</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Company, acknowledg the Young King for the alone
King and Soveraign.</p>
            <p>But their Miniſters declare him to be an Uſurper,
and a Rebel of the Father.</p>
            <p>Their Maſters endeavour to eſtabliſh a ſetled Peace
with him.</p>
            <p>They ſet themſelves formally againſt him as their
Enemy.</p>
            <p>Their Maſters endeavour to Oblige the Son by all
means poſſible, and ſend great quantity of all manner
of Ammunition of War to him.</p>
            <p>They do not only diſoblige him in all things, but
even aſſiſt his Enemies with the Proviſion ſent to his
Aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>Their Maſters in their fore-mentioned Letter, pray
that God the Creator of Heaven and Earth, would
bleſs and proſper him.</p>
            <p>They endeavour to bereave him of his Throne, and
make him the moſt miſerable of men.</p>
            <p>So that having by theſe Unrighteous Courſes
brought upon themſelves to be driven out of <hi>Bantam,</hi>
they now know not how to excuſe the Matter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:95727:10"/>
And being diſappointed in their Deſign, as fallen
into the Pit they digged for others, they are at their
Wits End, and know not what to do; ſome body
muſt be found out upon whom to lay the Blame, and
the next that comes to hand is the <hi>Netherlandiſh</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
<hi>Hic mihi turbat aquas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But had they ſate ſtill, or had (as they would make
the World believe) kept themſelves Neutral, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Will and Footſteps of their Maſters; or
had they inſtead of helping the Old, aſſiſted the Young
King, theſe difficulties nor queſtions had never hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened.</p>
            <p>And how can the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> with any ſhew of reaſon,
diſpute or call in queſtion the Soveraignty of the
Young King; ſeeing it is a known caſe, that the
ſending and admitting of Ambaſſadors and Agents,
together with the making of Treaties and Alliances,
are true Tokens of a Soveraign Power; and therefore
all ſuch as admit and receive Ambaſſies, do thereby
acknowledg the Soveraignty of them that ſend the
ſame: which is alſo further owned by proffers of
Alliances and Leagues, which cannot be erected but
between Soveraigns.</p>
            <p>Now as to the Second Fact: to wit, That after the
<hi>Netherlandiſh</hi> Company had got the Young King into
their Snares, and perfidiouſly brought him under
their Yoke, they then ſhould have forced him to the
Expulſion of the <hi>Engliſh:</hi> This we have before mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted
to be a falſe Fiction; For firſt, They ought not
in a caſe of ſo great weight and tendency, to make
ſuch odious and malicious Poſitions, except they had
clear and convincing Proofs at hand. There is not
any one of the Witneſſes, which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company
have produced, that mentions a Word thereof, or
that ſpeaks of Snares into which they of <hi>Batavia</hi> cauſed
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:95727:10"/>
the Young King to fall, or of any Yoke under which,
againſt all fidelity, they had brought him.</p>
            <p>It is true, they produce in the Proceſs one Mr.
<hi>Waite,</hi> ſpeaking of the departure of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> by
Order of the King; who relates only of an hard
Conteſt between the ſaid King and Major Sir <hi>Martin,</hi>
before that Order of cauſing them to depart, could
be obtained from him: <hi>But being,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>altogether
under the Power of the</hi> Hollanders, <hi>he was neceſſitated
thereunto.</hi> But beſides what might be alledged to
weaken this Aſſertion, he confeſſeth, <hi>That what he
witneſſeth thereof, is not of his own Knowledg, but that he
believeth it to be True upon the Credit of Perſons of Worth;</hi>
which of it ſelf is enough to reject the ſame: As alſo
it is very obſervable what on this Subject the foreſaid
Sir <hi>Martin,</hi> and others with him, do declare; to wit,
<hi>That the Conteſt was not to diſpoſe the King to the Ejection
of the</hi> Engliſh, <hi>but to turn away the Wrath and Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the King</hi> (which becauſe of their Aſſiſtance of
his Father and the Rebels, he had taken up againſt
them) <hi>and thereby to deliver them from the loſs of all their
Goods, yea Life it ſelf, as out of Revenge he had deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
againſt them:</hi> Which alſo was ſo taken and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company at <hi>Bantam,</hi> when
by their <hi>Agent</hi> they returned thanks unto the Miniſters
of the <hi>Netherlandiſh</hi> Company for their Protection.
But ſuppoſe the King had not been ſo incenſed againſt
them, as hath been ſaid; and that he had not had
deſign at all to be avenged on them, yet the meer
conſideration of his Security might have moved him
to their Ejection, as being aſſured they aſſiſted his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels;
and in apprehenſion, that they, as well verſed
in Warlike Affairs, might from <hi>England,</hi> or elſewhere,
re-enforce themſelves with Ships and Soldiers; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the perillous Neighbourhood of their Warehouſe
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95727:11"/>
to his Caſtle, his Father lying round about <hi>Bantam</hi>
with his Army, and keeping it yet for ſome Months
beſieged; and he as yet by his Auxiliary Forces ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
only the Sea open, might, if he were not very
circumſpect, be again ſuddenly aſſaulted; or at leaſt,
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> remaining in <hi>Bantam,</hi> by ſpying all oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities,
make Diſcoveries to the Enemies; ſo as in
the way of Providence, it was requiſite for him to do
what he did.</p>
            <p>If the Letters (brought in the Proceſs) be reviewed,
it will appear, whether it be true, as is imputed to
them; that they of their own motion did ſend Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours
to the ſaid King; yea ſo, as thereby (if their
moſt injurious Aſperſion were true) to get him into
their Clutches: or on the contrary, that it was done
at the Great, and Inſtant Entreaties of the Young
King, after that all ways of Reconciliation had in
vain been attempted.</p>
            <p>But foraſmuch as this Aſſiſtance and Succour is thus
averſly, and after ſo odious a manner declaimed, it
will be neceſſary to relate the ſame ſomewhat more
fully, and more clearly to diſcover the occaſion and
progreſs thereof.</p>
            <p>After the Rulers of <hi>Batavia</hi> had ripely conſulted
about the conſtitution of the Affairs of the Young
King, they thought meet, as alſo hath before been
ſpecified, to proffer their Service of Mediation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Father and the Son: To which end they
wrote two Letters in civil and obliging Terms, teſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Purpoſe and Affection in a way of Friendſhip
to accommodate, and lay by their queſtions and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences;
and with that Intention ſent their Plenipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiaries
with Letters, the one to the Father, and
the other to the Son, in a Ship prepared to that End;
after that ſome days before, by way of advance, they
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:95727:11"/>
had alſo ſent three other Ships: But conſidering thoſe
Plenipotentiaries went unto a place where the Parties
on both ſides were in Arms, and not being certain
whether they might meet with Friends or Enemies;
they therefore judged themſelves obliged to put them
into a poſture of Defence, furniſhing them with Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons,
in caſe of neceſſity, to make Reſiſtance to ſuch,
as forgetting the Right of Nations (eſpecially in that
confuſed State of things) and the reſpect that ought
to be given to Publick Perſons, might poſſibly attempt
to lay hold on, and injure them. And this is that
Fleet of Ships and Barks, which in theſe and other of
their Writings, they ſo much enhaunce and make a
ſtir about, as ſent to <hi>Bantam,</hi> to land our Troops
there.</p>
            <p>Our foreſaid Plenipotentiaries having waited ſome
time for an Anſwer from the Old King, received
none: And not knowing what properly the Intention
of theſe men might be as to them, ſent a good Troop
of men, to inform themſelves more exactly of the
State of things: But being a little advanced, they
met ſome <hi>Europeans,</hi> who by an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man enquired
of them, wherefore they came to intermeddle with
the differences of the two Kings? Whereupon being
anſwered, That they came as Friends to procure a
Peace between the Father and the Son; they ſoon
perceived the Deſign they had formed againſt them:
For forthwith they ſaw a Great Troop of Men ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
together, making ready ſome Fireſhips, and
other Veſſels fitted for War; making a ſhew, as if
they would fall foul with us, who verily were too
few in Number, to have thoughts to attempt any
thing againſt ſo powerful an Enemy, who ſeemed to
come againſt them: which alſo they did, and came
to the Deed it ſelf, ſhooting at us: and with their
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:95727:12"/>
Canons, which were managed by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> they
much endamaged our Ships; whereby they perceived
that they not only did not accept of our Mediation,
but alſo that they treated us as Enemies. Upon which
they of <hi>Batavia</hi> ſoon reſolved, by force of Arms, to
deliver the young King out of this Miſery and the
brink of Death; and to this end to ſend a ſufficient
power of Ships and Men to his Aſſiſtance, which alſo
had that Succeſs, as before is mentioned.</p>
            <p>The Aſſiſtance which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> gave to the Old
King, whereby the Diſpleaſure and Wrath of the
Young King was ſo kindled againſt them, even to
their Ejection out of his Country, is ſo notoriouſly
known to the World, that beſides the Proofs which
the <hi>Netherlandiſh</hi> Company have already alledged,
they yet further could bring hundreds of convincing
Teſtimonies; but let only the Letters of the Young
King, which he ſent from his beſieged Caſtle to them
of <hi>Batavia,</hi> be produced, and you ſhall hear him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
in theſe formal Words.</p>
            <p>What Reaſon hath the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Captain to help to ſhoot at
me, without once laying to heart that he is Reſident in my
Land and Sea? This is yet worſe, that Mr. <hi>Bowyer</hi> (one
of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants at <hi>Bantam)</hi> cauſes my Houſe to
be ſhot at; not once thinking, that I deſired the King of
<hi>England</hi> that he might be Captain in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lodge. I
requeſt of Capitain <hi>Moor Speelman,</hi> that he will warn the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> not to come on Shore, to ſhoot at my Houſe, and
aſſiſt mine Enemy alſo with Powder; foraſmuch as he hath
his Reſidence in my Land, but not in the Land of Sultan
<hi>Agon</hi> (the Old King) As alſo to perſwade them not to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
mine Enemy, ſeeing they drink my Water, and dwell in
my Land; and that they cloſe no more with Sultan <hi>Agon:</hi>
if Captain <hi>Moor</hi> have Love for me, let him be pleaſed
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:95727:12"/>
forcibly to inſinuate this unto the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that above all
things they ſhoot not at my Houſe, nor betake themſelves to
Land.</p>
            <p>The which alſo in a following Letter to the Major
St. <hi>Martin,</hi> he further confirmed.</p>
            <p>Beſide, the ſaid King did afterward make often
Complaints to the whole World, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had
given all aſſiſtance to his Enemies: Yea one of the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> themſelves, relates in a certain Book printed
at <hi>London,</hi> in which he gives an Account of what
paſſed at <hi>Bantam</hi> during the War, and of which he
was an Eye-witneſs, <hi>viz.</hi> That they of the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Nation had furniſhed the Old King with moſt of all
the Ammunition he had; and withall, that they uſed
all means poſſible, to encourage and incenſe the <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vans</hi>
againſt the Dutch: And thereupon he concludes,
that they (to wit, the <hi>Engliſh)</hi> had no Ground much
to rely upon the Friendſhip of the <hi>Netherlanders,</hi> in
caſe they once came to ſet foot on Land: Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
they are not aſhamed to deny all this. Yea,
in the Memorial delivered by Mr. <hi>Chardin</hi> (while he
was here) and ſeconded, and further confirmed by a
certain Memorial, which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company together
with their Demands, delivered over to the Commiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
who were to decide on both ſides: Namely, that
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in all this while, had kept themſelves alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
Neutral between the ſaid oppoſing Parties; and
conclude from thence, that the King had not out of his
Motion cauſed them to depart, but through the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of the Major Sir <hi>Martin</hi> (a thing moſt notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
falſe) as at the beginning they clamoured, and
publiſhed to the whole World; namely, That we
drave them out with Force, after a moſt barbarous
and unheard-of manner.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:95727:13"/>
So then it appears on both ſides, that their Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
was cauſed by the Kings Order, who only hath
power of Command in his Country, and whoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
they were bound to obey: But it is denied, and
there is Reaſon to proteſt againſt Injury done us, as
if we had been the Effecters of the ſame. Ought not
then the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to prove that Fact? Undoubtedly
yea. But have they any Proof thereof? Certainly
none at all. Can the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſatisfie with this, that
inſtead of Proof, they only produce obſcure, ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Diſcourſes, to which no Credit will be given,
ſave only by ſuch as are pre-occupied, and ready to
take whatever may ſerve to feed and ſtrengthen an
anticipated Humour.</p>
            <p>They remonſtrate, That in a certain Hearing, which
the King of <hi>Bantam</hi> granted them ſoon after the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
Victory, they could not perceive the leaſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper
or Indignation; but that indeed there were
ſome hot Words paſſed between the King, and Sir
<hi>Martin.</hi> But, I pray, is this a Proof to convince as
to a Crime, eſpecially of ſuch nature as this? We
neither may, nor can rely upon the Geſture and
Countenance of any, much leſs of a King; eſpecially
of an <hi>Indian</hi> Prince, who ſeeks to keep in his Wrath
and Indignation, and to take his beſt Opportunity to
Avenge himſelf. Is there any one that ever heard
that Major Sir <hi>Martin</hi> inſtigated the King to chaſe the
<hi>Engliſh?</hi> Is there any thing produced in the leaſt
rending thereto? Certainly nothing. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
the ſaid Sir <hi>Martin,</hi> as a Man of Honour, a
Gentleman of Quality, and ſurpaſſing Modeſty, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Learning, wholly takes off all ſiniſter ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in proteſting that the Intercourſe with the King
was intended to no other end, than to divert and
take off the King from the Deſign he had to deſtroy
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95727:13"/>
all the <hi>Engliſh:</hi> and ſhould he not to do ſo, have had
much more reaſon, then, as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company in
their Demand given in againſt the <hi>Netherlandiſh</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
and more amply in their Reply, do aſſert; that
he ſome years before had cauſed the Agent of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
Company to be murthered, together with their
Comiſes; of which they afterwards made ſuch heavy
Complaints, yet nothing followed thereupon. Is it
then to be wondred at, that he was ſo greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed
becauſe of this their Action, that except he
had forcibly been diſſwaded by Sir <hi>Martin,</hi> he had
cauſed them all to be ſlain? They endeavour alſo to
make the <hi>Netherlandiſh</hi> Company, or their Miniſters,
ſuſpected to have an hand likewiſe in this Action; but
they are neceſſitated to proteſt againſt this outragious
Injury and Calumny. They who at the ſame time
were ſo highly out of Favour with the Old King,
then reigning, would certainly be far from having an
hand in ſo horrible a Murther, by which they could
not in any reſpect be advantaged. If that <hi>William
Kaef,</hi> the <hi>Netherlandiſh</hi> Reſident at <hi>Bantam,</hi> when the
Old King overthrew and ſacked the City, was fain
for to eſcape Maſſacring, to retire to <hi>Batavia,</hi> leaving
all the Goods and Effects of the <hi>Netherlandiſh</hi> Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
in their Lodge; which undoubtedly was by ſome
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> though perhaps without the knowledge of
their Maſters, in part ſtolen. Should not then the
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> had they not in that Fury been protected by
the <hi>Netherlandiſh</hi> Forces, have been in far greater
danger? Would there have been any appearance for
any of them, to have eſcaped with their Lives? And
nevertheleſs according to their Saying, It is the <hi>Dutch</hi>
that cauſed all theſe Troubles and Miſchiefs to befal
them. But the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were not then of that Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
nor uſed ſuch kind of Language, when they came
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:95727:14"/>
ſo ſolemnly to declare their Thankfulneſs to the <hi>Dutch,</hi>
for their good will and protection they had ſhewed
to them.</p>
            <p>But how little the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company doth agree with
it ſelf, and how often they are out and in, in their
Writings, doth hereby appear; That in what they
have depoſed by form of Demand, themſelves ſay,
That their Agent and the Council, the day after the
raiſing of the Siege, were with the King in his Caſtle,
to take off, and appeaſe, if poſſible, the Chagrin and
Wrath of the King, ſo hot againſt them: and that
they then found him by far leſs incenſed, than the
<hi>Hollanders</hi> ſaid he was. Furthermore, in their ſaid
Memorial, which they delivered over, together with
the foreſaid Pretences, and to which by the foreſaid
Demand they adhere; they ſay, That the ſame day
they were introduced to the King, who laid before
them many Accuſations, not ſo much as permitting
them to ſpeak a word for their Defence.</p>
            <p>It followeth then, that whereas they ſaid, when
they were brought in before him, they could not in
the leaſt perceive in his Poſture or Viſage any token of
Indignation, is a pure Untruth.</p>
            <p>But yet further, to convince the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company
of the Falſhood of what they impute to the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landiſh</hi>
Company, and that after ſo Odious a manner;
it is only needful to look over the Anſwer of the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlandiſh</hi>
Company, to the Complaints brought in
by Mr. <hi>Chudley</hi> and Sir <hi>John Chardin,</hi> in <hi>May</hi> 1683;
whereby the ſame doth teſtifie a ſuperabounding Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
and perfect Readineſs to contribute to all
means and ways of Re-eſtabliſhing of the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Company there, by employing their Credit and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
with the preſent King; as alſo to reconcile the
two contending Parties, according to a <hi>Medium</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:95727:14"/>
propoſed, and ſo conſequently to recall our Troops
out of the Kingdom of <hi>Bantam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now it can eaſily be conceived, they would not
have done all this, in caſe that by their means that
war had been raiſed, or that they had had an hand in
the chaſing of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> or had cauſed the ſame;
much leſs, if it had been true, as is maliciouſly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to them, that for many years ſince, they had
plotted for to draw, and by that means, to engroſs
the whole Pepper-Trade unto themſelves; and that,
as they affirm, to the ineſtimable Damage of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
Company, of which ſhall be further ſpoken here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.
And ſeeing then it is a falſe Fiction, that the
<hi>Dutch</hi> Company ſhould have driven the <hi>Engliſh</hi> out of
<hi>Bantam,</hi> although perhaps it might have been (which
nevertheleſs was never directly nor indirectly attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted)
that by ſuggeſtion they might have ſomewhat
contributed thereunto: yet hereby alſo their pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Action of Damage and Reparation doth fall of it
ſelf.</p>
            <p>But that of which alſo they have made an hideous
Cry and Tintamar, by an expreſs Complaint in their
foreſaid Memorial, which in <hi>May</hi> 1683 they preſented
to your Puiſſant Highneſſes, and which they more
fully dilated afterward; is, firſt, That the day after
the deliverance of the King, one <hi>James de Roy,</hi> Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
to the Company of Major Sir <hi>Martin,</hi> ſhould
have taken down the Flag named the <hi>Banner</hi> of St.
<hi>George,</hi> planted upon the Houſe of one Captain <hi>John
Fiſher:</hi> that the ſaid <hi>Fiſher</hi> thereupon making haſte to
his Houſe, found the ſaid <hi>de Roy</hi> with a part of the
Flag in his Hand, having torn the reſt, and given it
to the Soldiers to make Scarfs of.</p>
            <p>Again, the ſaid Soldiers had drunk out part of the
Drinking-Wares, and taken away the Remainder,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:95727:15"/>
together with his Houſe-hold-Stuff; and withal evilly
entreated him, and placed ſome <hi>Black-Moores</hi> in his
Houſe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that five days after the departure of the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> from <hi>Bantam,</hi> our Soldiers came into the Houſe
of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company, and had ſent ſome <hi>Moores</hi>
(of their Servants) to fetch off the Pavillion that was
diſplaid on their Lodge.</p>
            <p>Now ſuppoſe all this to be a true Story, and might
thereupon give credit at the Depoſition of one Man
only, to wit, the foreſaid Capt. <hi>Fiſher,</hi> and that alſo in
his own Caſe; for further Witneſſes are not brought
for Proof of this Fact: Yet it is conſiderable, the
Actor hereof was in Service of the King, and not, as
is very abuſively ſaid, the Lieutenant of Major Sir
<hi>Martin,</hi> and conſequently the Soldiers were <hi>Banta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers.</hi>
And it is worthy of Obſervation, foraſmuch
as this <hi>Jaques de Roy</hi> is ſo often brought upon the
Stage, that he is a Perſon, who ſomewhile before the
War, was retired from <hi>Batavia</hi> to <hi>Bantam,</hi> for to ſhun
his Creditors, whom the young King took into his
Service; who had in, and during the War, ſignaliz'd
himſelf by ſpecial Services; wherefore alſo he was
highly eſteemed by the ſaid King, though himſelf were
a Man of litttle worth.</p>
            <p>Again, although the foreſaid firſt Flag (for there is
mention made of two) might have been the Banner
of St. <hi>George,</hi> yet could it not bring any reſpect to a
private Houſe, and thereby to be freed from the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders
that in time of War are incident, more than to
any other Houſe. And what concerns the Banner, and
uſe made thereof, is that a thing to make ſo much
Diſturbance, that a Captain of the King ſhould with
his Soldiers take down from a private Houſe the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
Flag, after that the King and the whole Nation
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:95727:15"/>
lookt on him as an Enemy of his Perſon and of the
State?</p>
            <p>What concerns the Second part, although the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
thereof might perhaps be according to Truth,
which nevertheleſs is doubted of, and cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
it doth not touch the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company, yea tho
it had been done by their Men, but muſt be imputed
to the Diſorders in War.</p>
            <p>As to the third point, if the recital thereof be according
to Truth, and that they ſent ſome of their Black Servants
to take down the Banner, which notwithſtanding is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but a Report and Recital of ſome <hi>Chineſes;</hi> this
doth nothing to the Charging of the <hi>Netherlandiſh</hi>
Company: the ſaid <hi>Chineſes</hi> might be demanded, how
they came to know thoſe <hi>Moores</hi> were Servants of the
<hi>Dutch</hi> Soldiers, and not of the King, as is much
more probable; ſeeing it ſhould be an unuſual thing,
at leaſt unheard of among us, that ſimple Soldiers
ſhould have <hi>Moores</hi> to their Servants. But, <hi>poſito,</hi> that
the <hi>Dutch</hi> Souldiers might have been Executors of the
Kings Order therein; the Kings Right is inconteſtable,
and he might take away the Pavillion of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi>
after that he had baniſhed them out of his Country:
Yea, tho the Soldiers had done it without the Order
of the King, which is not likely, yet had it been no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe than a Military Inſolence, which alſo muſt
be aſcribed to the Diſorders of War, where the Laws
of Modeſty and Decency are ſeldom regarded; and
therefore, without Injuſtice, cannot be imputed to
them, who in the time of the War at <hi>Bantam,</hi> did
repreſent the Government of <hi>Batavia,</hi> who never were
behind-hand in that reſpect which they owe to
Crowned Heads. But what need is it to have recourſe
to Conjectures, whereas by a certain produced Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
it is apparent, that it was the King himſelf who
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:95727:16"/>
commanded the Flag to be taken down from the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Lodge. And what is ſaid of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Flags,
which after the Victory were planted upon the Caſtle,
and in other parts of the City, deſerves no Anſwer;
ſince it is a known thing, that we never pretended
any territorial Right in <hi>Bantam,</hi> much leſs put the ſame
in execution; but however the ſaid Flags ſerved to
no other purpoſe, than to make it known to the <hi>Dutch</hi>
Troops, who after the raiſing of the Siege, were poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the principal places of the City, according to the
uſual practiſe every where on like occaſions. The Flag
upon the Caſtle was ſet up by order of the King, to
ſhew honour to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> however placed under the
Flag of the King.</p>
            <p>Beſides they of the Engliſh Company complain,
That the day after the raiſing of the Siege, the <hi>Dutch</hi>
Reſident <hi>Kaeff,</hi> with a Troop of Soldiers, and ſome
Maſons, came into the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lodge, and ordered
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Agent forthwith to take away the Galleries,
and to nail up the Window: And that thereupon a
<hi>Dutch</hi> Renegate, who was in his Company, began
preſently to threaten him, That if the <hi>Engliſh</hi> did
not, he himſelf would do it: which alſo, as they ſay,
he really did.</p>
            <p>This ſeemeth to be an outragious act done to the
<hi>Engliſh;</hi> but if we look into the nature of the thing,
it will be found to be a meer trifle, which they ought
to be aſhamed to urge in this manner.</p>
            <p>The Hiſtory is this: Becauſe the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company
would not be troubleſom to any, they choſe their own
Lodge at <hi>Bantam</hi> for their Magazine of Arms, and
other proviſions. Now the Wall of their ſaid Lodge
touching part of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Companies dwelling-houſe,
and in that ſame Wall they formerly had had no other
opening beſide a Caſement; ſomewhile after, the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:95727:16"/>
               <hi>Engliſh,</hi> by permiſſion of the Old King, who let ſlip
no opportunity to affront and moleſt them, made great
wide windows to open and ſhut, and beſides that, a
Gallery alſo, which hanging four or five foot over the
ground of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> Lodge, gave the <hi>Engliſh</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to hear and ſee all whatever the <hi>Dutch</hi> did.
The young King conſidering that our ſaid Lodge, in
time of War, was like to be the great Magazine,
thought it requiſite to prevent ſuch dangerous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
as might be occaſioned by overtures, being
over a place of the Houſe, where the Powder and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Ammunitions of War did lye, and out or
through which Windows or overtures in the Wall,
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> at all times might come upon that place at
their pleaſure; and knowing the <hi>Engliſh</hi> would not
ſeal up thoſe Windows, nor ſuffer the Galleries to be
taken away, he thereupon ſent his ſervants with a
<hi>Dutch</hi> Renegado, to cauſe it to be done; and it may
perhaps be true, That the Reſident <hi>Kaeff</hi> was at that
time preſent, foraſmnch as it was done in the ſaid
lodge of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company, where, according to
his Office, he was to take care of the Magazine.</p>
            <p>What evil can herein be imputed to the Company?
and what accuſation can the <hi>Engliſh</hi> frame from this?
A thing, which way ſoever they take it, was carried
on by the Authority of the King, and according to
their ſaying, executed by a Renegado; the very
naming of whom, ſhews, that he was not in Service
nor under the Oath of the <hi>Netherlandiſh</hi> Company.</p>
            <p>And what beſides this they lay to the charge of the
<hi>Dutch</hi> Company is, firſt, that they ſhould have taken
from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> their Horſes, and ſome other things,
and have conſtrained them to take out the Powder
that was in their Ships and to bring it aſhore.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:95727:17"/>
Secondly, That what they, at the command of the
King to depart, in all haſte had laden in their boats to
bring aboard their Ships, in which neither the people
of the Country, nor the Soldiers did any ways hinder
them; but paſſing by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Chaloups which
kept the watch at Sea, they were by them arreſted,
under pretence, they had order to ſuffer nothing to
be carried aboard the Engliſh Ships, and in caſe they
perſiſted to do it, they ſhould be ſhot at, by which they
ſhould have been neceſſitated to return to Land with
their Boats.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That they complaining of ſuch violence
to Major Sir <hi>Martin,</hi> he in a jeſting way ſhould anſwer,
that all was done by order from the King, whereas
no Man on Land, Soldier, or others, had a hand in
thoſe Violences, but all was done by our Soldiers
only.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That the chief of the <hi>French</hi> requiting of
the King reſtitution of four Cheſts with Silver which
was taken from him, the King ſhould anſwer in the
preſence of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Commiſſary, that he knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
thereof; and that he would do no injury nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to them, nor to the <hi>Engliſh, Danes,</hi> or other
Strangers trafficking in his Country; and in caſe any
wrong had been done unto him, ſince the <hi>Hollanders</hi>
had ſet foot on Land, that he muſt require reparation
from the <hi>Dutch</hi> Commiſſary, or the General at <hi>Bata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, That at the laſt inſtance made, to cauſe the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> to quit <hi>Bantam,</hi> being, as they ſay, the day before
their departure, our Soldiers came into the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lodge,
robbed the Chambers, and took away all they found
there; whereupon the people of the Country (ſo far
were they from doing them the leaſt wrong) permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them to Seal up their Magazine, and undertook to
keep it ſafe for them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:95727:17"/>
What concerns the firſt point, foraſmuch as they do
not only not ſay, much leſs prove, that our men
ſhould have taken the Horſes and other goods from
the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> nor that they ſhould have conſtrained
them to fetch their Powder out of their Ships, therefore
the <hi>Netherlandiſh</hi> Company will paſs that by as a thing
which doth not concern them, and of which they are
wholly diſcharged by the often forementioned Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
annexed to the demand or pretence which the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Company depoſed and delivered in, and to
which they do refer themſelves; in which is expreſly
ſaid, that <hi>Pagoran Diepa Panerat,</hi> one of the principal
Miniſters of the young King, or rather the firſt Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of State, had done the ſame, although they put
it in ſuch general and Ambiguous expreſſions, in all
appearance, as if they would lay it to the charge of
our Men: Only what concerns the Powder, the <hi>Dutch</hi>
Company doth ſay, that in caſe it were true, that the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> were fain, by the order of the King, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lade
the ſame, and bring it to Land; that it was done,
not becauſe the King ſtood in need of it, for he was
abundantly furniſhed by them of <hi>Batavia;</hi> but only to
prevent that they might not deliver the ſame to his
Enemies; and beſides, it cannot be ill taken, that the
King in that confuſed ſtate of things, would oppoſe
and hinder the <hi>Engliſh</hi> from going ſo often to and fro
to their Ships.</p>
            <p>Concerning the ſecond point, namely, that we
ſhould have hindred the <hi>Engliſh</hi> from departing out of
<hi>Bantam,</hi> and alſo to have ſtopped their Boats, hath
not the leaſt appearance of truth in it; foraſmuch as
themſelves confeſs, that we aſſiſted them with our
Boats and Chaloups to carry their Goods and Wares
aboard their Ships, when none of the people of the
Country, or their Boats could be obtained to be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:95727:18"/>
to them therein; ſo little acceptance they had
with that Nation: And how can this hang together,
That we ſhould have procured their departure from
the King, and then when they were ready to depart,
to hinder it? Yea, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> diſagree in the very
Poſition laid down about it; for their foreſaid Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,
to which by their demand they refer themſelves,
dictates not that their men were ſtopt at Sea by our
Barks that kept watch, but that it was done by the
watch of the <hi>Netherlandiſh</hi> Company on Land, at the
mouth of the Haven; to wit, as having order to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
nothing to be carried from Land to the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Ships.</p>
            <p>The complaints which thereupon they ſhould have
made to Major Sir <hi>Martin,</hi> comprehended in the third
point, as if he had in a kind of mockage anſwered
them, That <hi>all was done by order of the King;</hi> What
doth this make to the thing? For put the caſe the
ſaid Major (which notwithſtanding is not granted)
might ſay, not in way of mockage, but in earneſt,
that it was to be imputed to the order of the King,
which goes farther, if thoſe orders had been executed
by our Soldiers; although that alſo is denied, and of
which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> do produce no proofs; yet could it
not any ways prejudice the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company, as not
being bound to be reſponſible for the Orders of the
King.</p>
            <p>Touching the King's Anſwer to the Chief of the
<hi>French</hi> his complaint, and that the King remitted him
as to that matter to <hi>Batavia,</hi> of which is ſpoken in the
fourth point, although it ſhould be all true, which
notwithſtanding is not proved, it might be that the
King did it in ſuch a manner to free himſelf from the
trouble of thoſe complaints, as well knowing that
one of his Miniſters had ſeized on the ſaid Cheſts with
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:95727:18"/>
Silver, which however it be, neither concerns the
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> nor obligeth the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company to be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
for the ſame.</p>
            <p>But to demonſtrate yet more fully how far the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
Company, in all their pretences, do err from the
truth, they ſay, as may be ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n, in the propoſal of
the firſt point, That the people of the Country, to
wit, of <hi>Bantam,</hi> the day before they, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
were cauſed to remove, did indeed come into their
Lodge, but without doing of them the leaſt Injury; and
yet they ſay in their foreſaid Memorial annexed to their
Demand, that at the ſame time they took away all
their Proviſion (driving the <hi>Engliſh</hi> out of the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
(except one named <hi>Wait)</hi> and took poſſeſſion
thereof; but a little after the <hi>Dutch</hi> Soldiers came,
who further made ſpoil, and carried away all they
found there: But this cannot be; becauſe the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
had, a day before their departure, carried away for
<hi>Batavia,</hi> in the Ships of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company, all their
moveables, to the very leaſt thing of any worth (their
departure, as themſelves ſay, being the 12th of <hi>April)</hi>
and ſo nothing could be found: And beſides, all the
time of their inhabiting of <hi>Batavia,</hi> which d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>red more
than a year, they never brought in any complaints,
by a Liſt or other way, ſhewing what the <hi>Dutch</hi> Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
had rob'd them of; but on the contrary, they
came and rendred their thanks to the Government
there, for all the aſſiſtance had been done unto them,
without the leaſt mention of wrong received; which
had they done, the Government there might forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
have cauſed enquiry to be made, and if it had
been true, procured ſatisfaction; but letting that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
ſlip, and being negligent therein, and then to
bring in their Complaints here, and that without any
proof, the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſay is a thing altogether unreaſonable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:95727:19"/>
As hath before been alledged, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company
from the beginning hath pretended re-eſtabliſhment at
<hi>Bantam</hi> from the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company, and to which in
their Demand, or Memorial of their Pretences, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
over to the Commiſſaries of both ſides, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
perſiſting, with requeſt, that the ſame may in
the firſt place, before all other things, be debated and
determined, taking for their foundation, that that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhment
had already been accorded and agreed to
by your Puiſſant Higneſſes, and by the <hi>Netherlandiſh</hi>
Company.</p>
            <p>But now not yet content with that, they pretend
by their foreſaid Demand, beſides the recalling of the
<hi>Dutch</hi> Troops, the delivering over the Caſtle of <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam</hi>
in its entire, for to put into it a ſtrong Gariſon,
pretending, that otherwiſe they would not be willing
to ſettle themſelves again there; yea, they require that
the whole City be delivered up, and put into the
hands of His Majeſty of Great <hi>Brittain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What concerns the firſt, It is true indeed that the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Company did pretend all this; but it is evident,
that the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company hath as little right to this, as
to give over the whole City with the Caſtle, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their further pretence: We who have only a
ſimple reſidence, without participation of any Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
which doth wholly reſide in the perſon of the
King, it is for us a moral impoſſibility to diſpoſe of that
which <hi>Privative</hi> doth belong to the King, and ſo to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſh
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> there againſt his will, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſion
into his Right, and violating his Authority:
For although the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company have their Troops in
<hi>Bantam,</hi> which ſerve the King for a Gariſon to defend
his City, yet that affords them no Territorial Right,
nor the leaſt power to bring in again thoſe whom he
hath baniſhed from thence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:95727:19"/>
And as they cannot by force of Arms oblige the
King to take in again the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and re-ſettle them
in <hi>Bantam</hi> without uſurping upon the Right of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and deſervedly to incur the Diſaffection and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
of all the Princes and Potentates of <hi>Indie;</hi> ſo can
they with as little ground do it by Threatnings, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Injury to their Fidelity; which muſt be the ſtay of
the Credit of the ſaid Company among the <hi>Indian</hi>
People; who otherwiſe would not rely upon their
Word, nor enter into Alliances and Combinations
with them.</p>
            <p>But they of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company aver, that herein
not only conſiſts their Intereſt, but they have alſo the
Promiſe of your Puiſſant Highneſſes; they only requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Execution of the ſame.</p>
            <p>As to their Intereſt, the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company will eaſily
grant, that the foreſaid Re-eſtabliſhment might be for
their Advantage, (although they, as hath before been
ſaid, declare, that except they have a Gariſon and the
Caſtle for their Security, they would not reſide there)
ſo alſo undoubtedly it would be for their Intereſt, if
the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company did admit them into thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
where we have our Spices, and which we poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs
by Propriety, with Secluſion of all others: And
ſo alſo it would be for the Intereſt of this State, and
the Inhabitants thereof, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
them the Navigation and Trade in the <hi>Barbadoes,
Caribes, New-England, the Virginies,</hi> and many other
Countries they poſſeſs in <hi>America;</hi> where they will not
ſuffer us, nor other Nations of <hi>Europe</hi> ſo much as to
paſs their Seas. But the Queſtion in this caſe is not
the Convenience or the Intereſt, but the Right. If
that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company could groundedly maintain,
that the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company is bound to re-ſettle them
there, and prove it by clear and convincing Reaſons
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:95727:20"/>
that they had driven them out of <hi>Bantam,</hi> the buſineſs
were at an End.</p>
            <p>But to come to their Second ground, <hi>viz.</hi> The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
of your Puiſſant Highneſſes, and of the <hi>Dutch</hi>
Company, which was made to them <hi>Anno</hi> 1683, that
they ſhould be reſettled there. To this we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſaid, and do now again anſwer, that thoſe Prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
do ſerve for an undeniable Proof, that the <hi>Dutch</hi>
Company ſought nothing more than to continue with
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company in an intimate Friendſhip and
Confidence, which by that Accident at <hi>Bantam</hi> did
ſeem in ſome meaſure to be interrupted; and that
they would rather decline the Advantages which by
ſuch exceſſive Expences they had acquired there, than
to remain continually in Contention and Quarrel with
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company: And hereby the <hi>Dutch</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
obliterate thoſe Aſperſions and Calumnies impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to them; as if in all appearance they for their
own Intereſt, and wilfully, had incited and fomented
the Differences, and War that followed thereupon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Father and the Son; and had two years
before formed that Deſign by correſponding with <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ra;</hi> and ſo contrived the Baniſhing of
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> out of <hi>Bantam.</hi> For if all this had been
true, they ſhould very badly have managed their Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs,
after that all was thus ſucceeded, and they
with ſuch exceſſive Charges attained what they aimed
at, they ſhould then without any preſſing neceſſity,
have made ſo little account of it; and that for the
meer Pleaſure of them, who for all the Pretences,
and juſtification of their Complaints made, had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>w in way of Proof. Indeed had the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
Company at that time reſted ſatisfied, the <hi>Dutch</hi>
Company ſhould have been obliged to perform the
ſame, how prejudicial ſoever it might afterward have
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:95727:20"/>
been to them. But foraſmuch as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
was then pleaſed wholly to reject and break off
thoſe Tranſactions, whereas we ſo deſirouſly longed
that they might be brought to a good End in <hi>England;</hi>
and for which, it is ſaid, the Lord Ambaſſador <hi>Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
was fully authoriſed, all the time that Buſineſs of
<hi>Bantam</hi> was in the Terms, as they were, during the
Negotiations and Treaty with Mr. <hi>Chudlie</hi> and Sir
<hi>John Chardin</hi> in the <hi>Hague,</hi> and which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
alſo cauſed to be broken off. Whereupon it falls
now to be enquired into, Whether the <hi>Dutch</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
ſince the caſe of things be wholly changed and
of another nature, be ſtill obliged to the ſame?</p>
            <p>It is evident, that at that time the State of the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of <hi>Bantam</hi> was not known, namely, Whether
the War between the Father and the Son were yet
remaining, or ended: If it were determined, whether
by an Accommodation, or by the Sword: If by the
Sword, who of the two, the Father, or Son, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
Conqueror, and thereby became Maſter of the
Kingdom. During which uncertainty, it cannot be
judged Imprudency, that the <hi>Netherlandiſh Faſt-Indie</hi>
Company (by whoſe Forces the Son was delivered
from his inevitable Ruin, and by whom he further

and with condition the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhould yield no further
Aſſiſtance to the Father: and in caſe the Father were
Victor, that then the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhould employ all their
Credit by the Father, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company might
enjoy a good Neighbourhood with them: And theſe
Proffers of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company, while things ſtood
thus at an uncertainty, were the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the King of <hi>Bantam,</hi> becauſe they endeavoured there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to prevent the Succors which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
pretended to ſend the Father; and alſo becauſe at
that time it was not yet known, how far the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
had made themſelves irreconcilable to him.</p>
            <p>During this uncertainty of things, the <hi>Dutch</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
made theſe Proffers; yea Sir <hi>John Chardin</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
projected an Accommodation between both the
Companies, in which mention was made of the with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing
of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Troops out of <hi>Bantam,</hi> and
what each Company ſhould be obliged unto in thoſe
occaſional Accidents, as are thereby ſpecified. But as
it pleaſed the ſaid Mr. <hi>Chudlie</hi> and Sir <hi>John Chardin</hi>
very unexpectedly to break off thoſe Treaties, which
already were ſo far advanced, and they alſo of the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Company on their part did reject the Proffers,
which not only your Puiſſant Highneſſes in their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
Anſwer to the Memorial of Sir <hi>John Chardin,</hi> had
made; but thoſe alſo which the Ambaſſador <hi>Citters</hi>
afterwards did make, in the name, and upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the <hi>Netherlandiſh</hi> Company, after that the
foreſaid Sir <hi>John Chardin</hi> was returned into <hi>England,</hi>
and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> began again to bring in new Demands,
after they had very diſdainfully rejected the former;
hereupon the <hi>Netherlandiſh</hi> Company judged, that they
ſtood no longer bound to theirs, eſpecially, when as
ſome while after, by tidings on both ſides in Letters
from the <hi>Indies,</hi> it was ſignified, that the War at <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam</hi>
was ended to the advantage of the young King,
who reobtained the Kingdom as poſſeſſor, had taken
the Father Priſoner, and ſubdued his Rebels; ſo that
conſequently the <hi>Netherlandiſh</hi> Company had now no
longer any ground nor pretext, either to treat with
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> about their reſetling in <hi>Bantam,</hi> as being
<hi>Territorium plane alienum,</hi> much leſs to promiſe the ſame,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:95727:21"/>
and the rather, becauſe the now reigning King having
conſidered the Conſpiracies of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> with his
Father and rebellious Subjects, hath declared them his
pernicious Enemies.</p>
            <p>Seeing then, from all what hath been ſaid, it clearly
appeareth, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company did rather chuſe
to expect the uncertain Lot of War, than to agree
with the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company, while it was time, about
their Settlement; it is therefore reaſonable that they
now acquieſce, and leave the <hi>Netherlandiſh</hi> Company
unmoleſted, as to their re-eſtabliſhment.</p>
            <p>It followeth therefore, that it is wholly beſides the
purpoſe, at preſent, to make uſe, or apply to their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
the foreſaid anſwer of your Puiſſant High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
to the foreſaid Memorial, after they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
the foreſaid Proffer, and had determined not
only to re-eſtabliſh themſelves by force of Arms, but
wholly to become the Maſters of <hi>Bantam,</hi> and to that
end to ſet out a formidable Power of Ships and Men at
Sea, though their Enterprize, as they themſelves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
in their foreſaid reply, was ſtopt by his Majeſty
of happy Memory, and not ſuffered to put forth to
Sea: now this was the reaſon that they having form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and being buſie about this deſign, that the Charges
thereof might not be fruitleſs, did not only reject the
Proffers aforeſaid of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company, but made
ſuch Exceſſive Extravagant Demands, as the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
up of the whole City of <hi>Bantam</hi> with the Caſtle,
although they well knew that it neither would nor
could be accepted of us; or in caſe they were accepted,
that then they had attain'd to what they aimed.</p>
            <p>So long then as the ſtate of things was at an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty,
and it might be in doubt who of the twain,
Father or Son, ſhould have the upper-hand, though
the Son ſeemed by far more likely to prevail; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:95727:22"/>
the <hi>Netherlands</hi> Company judged, that in ſuch a
Conſtitution of things, it could not be ill taken, that
they entred with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company into a Treaty,
how they might after the beſt way procure a Peace
between the two Kings, by interpoſing their Credit
and Service of Love, and obtain the re-eſtabliſhment
of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company: but all this being rejected by
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> with diſdain; and that Uncertainty which
then was, being brought to a Certainty, ſo as the
whole buſineſs is become of quite another nature;
that the <hi>Netherlandiſh</hi> Company ſhould yet be bound
to perform, what they in the uncertain ſtate of things
did ſhew themſelves willing unto, the <hi>Netherlandiſh</hi>
Company apprehendeth, that it in juſtice cannot be
required. For firſt, thereby, beſides other conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
they ſhould certainly be made loſers of the Sum
of Six times hundred thouſand Ryxdollers, which
the King of <hi>Bantam</hi> by evening Accounts is found in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted
to the Dutch Company, and of which a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
is made with him in particular, in which he
grants to their Company the Traffick in his Kingdom,
ſo long and until he ſhall come to be in a condition to
repay the ſame to the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company: But that
which beſides this, deſerves to be reflected upon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is,
That the King of <hi>Bantam</hi> hearing a rumour that the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Company perſiſted in their pretence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſettlement
in <hi>Bantam,</hi> with the calling back of our
Troops thence, wrote to the Government of <hi>Batavia</hi>
(even after he had ſurmounted all difficulties) that
in caſe they ſhould conſent therein, and withdraw our
Militia from thence, he ſhould not be able to continue
maſter in the work, but be neceſſitated to retire to

that they would at no hand forſake, and reduce him

to ſuch extremities, but perform their word given him
by ſolemn Contract. And how ſhould the <hi>Netherland<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

againſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company. What concerns
the ſecond part of the Dilemma, if it be the young
King to whom this right doth belong, and that it be
true, that he had acted againſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> as an Enemy
ungrateful, barbarous, and with antipathy to their

but in the mean while we cannot let paſs,
without taking notice, that while they are pleaſed to
heap up reproaches upon the young King, then they
ſay, <hi>he had acted againſt the Subjects of his Majeſty as an
enemy, ungrateful, barbarous, with an Antipathy of their
Blood, without the leaſt provocation;</hi> further, that he is
unworthy of alliance with them; but when the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
is to load the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and make them the Authors
of their expulſion out of <hi>Bantam,</hi> then they alter their
ſtrain, and ſay, <hi>that they could not ſo much as obſerve nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the words or geſture of the King, the leaſt thing mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſting
any diſpleaſure againſt the</hi> Engliſh, <hi>or that he had a

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Here they name the preſent King a</hi> Slave of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlandiſh

the Old King, when he ſate on his Throne, would willingly
have been a Slave of the King of <hi>England,</hi> and thereof
would have made his triumph.</p>
            <p>In their Reply they give the mentioned King the
name of a <hi>pauvre Idiot,</hi> a vile perſon, <hi>une Chetive Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
&amp;c. And in their Letter they wrote to him in
<hi>March,</hi> 1683. they ſtile him a <hi>wiſe King,</hi> to whom they
ſay, they will ſend a perſon with the Title of <hi>Envoy</hi> or
<hi>Extraordinary Ambaſſador,</hi> with full power to conclude
an ever-during League and Alliance with him.</p>
            <p>The ſame Title the King of Great <hi>Britain</hi> giveth

they gave in, That by our reſidence at <hi>Bantam</hi> we had
made the Pepper-Trade more difficult to them; but in
their forenamed Reply they ſay, that we made way to
Monopolize the whole: ſo far may men be blinded by
paſſion.</p>
            <p>To what the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company do further depoſe in
their foreſaid Demand, <hi>viz.</hi> That thoſe in pay, of the
<hi>Dutch</hi> Company, had upon the Coaſt of <hi>Mallabar</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted
their Men, given fire on them, and this alſo to
deprive them of the remainder of the Trade in Pepper
they as yet had there. The <hi>Dutch</hi> could have wiſhed,
they had more clearly declared themſelves as to the
place where, the aforeſaid Coaſt lying along the Sea
the ſpace of an Hundred Miles; as alſo to the year and
time when, together to what Ship or Bark, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
what occaſion: As on their part the <hi>Netherlandiſh</hi>
Company is ready to ſhew after what manner they
dealt with our men upon the Weſt Coaſt of <hi>Sumatra,</hi>
to wit, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Frigat .... in <hi>September</hi> 1683.
being upon the Coaſt before <hi>Ayer Bangi,</hi> and ſending
out his Chaloup with about Forty Armed Soldiers,
againſt our men ſitting in a Boat, ſhooting once and
again with Bullets: As the Ships, the <hi>Society,</hi> the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident,</hi>
the <hi>Eagle,</hi> and <hi>Berckly-Caſtle,</hi> who at their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn

               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:95727:25"/>
in <hi>July</hi> and the following months of the year 1681.
overwintering at the Iſland <hi>Mauritius,</hi> committed no
ſmall inſolencies and miſchiefs, eſpecially they of the
<hi>Preſident,</hi> and <hi>Eagle,</hi> robbing and carrying away all
what they found, notwithſtanding all the complaints
and proteſtations made by the people of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
of which we have authentick evidences in
hand to ſhew.</p>
            <p>We paſs by, That the <hi>Engliſh</hi> for ſo many years
have made it their conſtant work to debauch our men
at <hi>Bengale,</hi> on the Coaſt of <hi>Cormandel,</hi> at <hi>Bantam,</hi> and
elſewhere, to draw them out of our Service, to ſerve
them on their Ships homeward (being weakly mann'd)
againſt the proteſtations made from time to time, as is
to be ſhewn by evidences in hands of the <hi>Netherlandiſh</hi>
Company. That the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company is intended,
as themſelves have divulged, to ſet down and build a
Fortreſs on <hi>Priamang,</hi> ſeated on the Weſt Coaſt of <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matra,</hi>
(a Country under the Command of the <hi>Dutch</hi>
Company, and where they have a Fort lying) which
by the firſt Letters that come, we expect to hear that
it is already effected, they having ſent to that end,
divers Ships, with Men, Materials, and Warlike fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture:
The miſchief that hence will enſue, may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
be gueſſed at.</p>
            <p>It is a thing inconceivable, how they dare publiſh
to the World, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company by a contract
made with them of <hi>Macaſſar, November</hi> Anno 1667,
and as they ſay, Printed at <hi>Batavia,</hi> by which the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
Nation was ſecluded from Commerce in that
Country; and of which, after the expiration of
Eighteen years, they make complaints in their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings:
Whereas ſince that time, two ſolemn Treaties
have been made betwixt <hi>England</hi> and this State, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
the forenamed agreement of the year 1674-75, by
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:95727:25"/>
which all pretences and actions whatſoever, which
might have been againſt each other, were nullified as
if they never had been; and although this ſhould not
be urged, the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company is ready to juſtify what
they did, by holding forth to the World their right
in making ſuch kind of Contracts. But what in this
caſe falls into ſpecial conſideration, is, that the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
Contracts, made by the <hi>Netherlandiſh</hi> Company,
was during the War with <hi>England,</hi> or before the peace
concluded, <hi>Anno</hi> 1667. was, or could be known in
the <hi>Indies,</hi> or at <hi>Macaſſer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So then although all were true what is publiſhed in
a certain Writing, and by Mr. <hi>Skelton</hi> Envoy Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,
annexed to the foreſaid Memorial, preſented
to your Puiſſant Highneſſes, That we had violently
ſeized on the Factors of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company, carried
them away Priſoners to <hi>Batavia,</hi> and then ſpoiled their
Houſes (although the Company, upon their Faith
and Credit, are ignorant hereof) what could this
any way help the <hi>Engliſh?</hi> or why ſhould they thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
about it? Hath not <hi>England</hi> about this very
time taken by Force <hi>New-Netherland</hi> from our <hi>W<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Company? and can the <hi>Dutch Weſt-Indie</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
frame an Action or Pretence hereon? Without
doubt, No.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company finding themſelves deſtitute
of neceſſary Proofs to make good the Matter of Fact
they charge the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company with, which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
can only ſerve as the Foundation of what they
urge: as alſo being convinced of the unanſwerable
Confutation made by the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company, with moſt
evident demonſtration of the ungroundedneſs of the
Aſſertions of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company; they betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in their Reply to Reproaches, calumniating the
<hi>Dutch</hi> Company in the conduct of their Affairs, after
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:95727:26"/>
ſo odious a manner, and in ſuch extravagant terms,
as muſt needs make all men aſtoniſhed, how people
of Honour and Underſtanding ſhould ſo forget them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
yea, ſo far, as that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commiſſaries
themſelves, in the Conference with the Commiſſaries
who on our ſide were to decide the buſineſs, were
conſtrained to abhor and manifeſt their diſcontent
thereof. And although the <hi>Dutch</hi> wanted no matter to

and to diſabuſe the World of ſo many untruths

               </gap>imputed to them; yet they judged it better to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain,
and with a modeſt ſilence to paſs it by, than enter
into further Conteſt, and make the Rupture of the
Friendſhip (which is ſo neceſſary between both the
Companies) yet greater, and the Wound incurable.</p>
            <p>The Demand the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company made by recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,
conſiſted herein, That they at the earneſt

kept ſome Months, making uſe of them inſtead of
Magazines, and for preſervation of their Wares and
Effects, to the great Prejudice of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company,

            <p>It remains that we ſpeak a word or two of what
happened before <hi>Gamron</hi> in the Gulph of <hi>Perſia,</hi> over
which alſo the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company make their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints:
Firſt, In a certain Article in their Triplick,
and afterward by that Writing which the foreſaid Mr.
<hi>Skelton</hi> Extraordinary Envoy, annexed to the foreſaid
Memorial by him preſented the ... of <hi>May</hi> laſt to
your Puiſſant Highneſſes, of which mention was made
in the beginning. This Article contains, firſt, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
againſt the Conduct of the Fleet which lately
the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company had in the Gulph of <hi>Perſia,</hi> with
which they intended, as they ſay, to ſhut, or lock up
all the Havens of that great Kingdom.</p>
            <p>And the ſaid Memorial did further make like Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints,
That the foreſaid Fleet conducted by <hi>Reynier
Kaſembroot,</hi> with violence ſhould have hindred <hi>John
Goldsborough,</hi> Maſter of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Companies Ship
called the <hi>Merchant of Bengale,</hi> from unlading the ſaid
Ship with Boats, thereby detaining and diſturbing
him in all their Traffick and Buſineſs: But after Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination,
this Complaint will be found as ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
as any of the other.</p>
            <p>The caſe is this, That the <hi>Netherlandiſh</hi> Company
time out of mind, having a Comptoir or Lodge,
together with their Traffick at <hi>Gamron,</hi> and other
places in the Kingdom of <hi>Perſia,</hi> by vertue of an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
made with the King, and of Priviledges
granted unto them; the <hi>Perſians</hi> in many points ſet
themſelves in oppoſition againſt them, offering them
many outragious and unjuſt dealings: and foraſmuch
as no Reparation or Redreſs in the leaſt could be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by any Requeſts made, although accompanied
with extraordinary and coſtly Preſents, at laſt it burſt
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:95727:27"/>
forth into Deeds, for to repair the Injury done. And
this is the Fleet of Ships which the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company
for this End had in the foreſaid Gulph, with which
they took from the <hi>Perſians</hi> the Iſland <hi>Kiſmus,</hi> with
the Caſtle in the ſaid Gulph, not far diſtant from <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>
or <hi>Gamron,</hi> not for to keep, for it could not have
been ſerviceable to us, but with intollerable Charge;
only it was done to induce and neceſſitate the <hi>Perſians</hi>
to condeſcend to Reaſon, which it alſo effected; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the <hi>Netherlandiſh</hi> Company reſtored the Iſland
and the Caſtle to the <hi>Perſians</hi> again.</p>
            <p>What then concerns the firſt Complaint, That with
that Fleet the <hi>Netherlandiſh</hi> Company ſought to ſhut
up all the Havens in <hi>Perſia,</hi> the <hi>Netherlandiſh</hi> Company
is neceſſitated to ſay, that it is very ſtrange to them,
that they ſhould ſo wrongfully and maliciouſly miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtrue
the good Intention of the <hi>Netherlandiſh</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
            <p>Hath the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company with that Fleet of Ships
done them the leaſt wrong or hinderance, as to what
concerns their coming or departing in or from the
ſaid Havens? Yea, even during the time that the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlandiſh</hi>
Company lay with the whole Fleet before
<hi>Gamron,</hi> Have not the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſailed in and out as they
pleaſed? They cannot but ſay, Yea.</p>
            <p>What Reaſon had they then to judge ſo maliciouſly
of their Deſign?</p>
            <p>But in the foreſaid Triplick it is ſaid, That the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlandiſh</hi>
Company intended indeed to ſet on foot and
effect it, in caſe the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had not by hap appeared
there with a greater Number of Ships, not to be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
or forced by the <hi>Netherlanders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But before they were arrived there with any num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Ships together, did not the foreſaid Fleet, and
the ſaid <hi>Kaſembroot</hi> let their ſingle Ships go in and out
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:95727:27"/>
freely and unmoleſted, yea even their Boats and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lops;
and with them alſo their Ship <hi>Williamſon</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
with Goods fraighted for and belonging to the
<hi>Perſians?</hi> Surely they cannot deny it.</p>
            <p>And what concerns this great number of Ships,
which they ſay they afterward had there, if compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with the number, eſpecially the greatneſs of the
<hi>Netherlandiſh</hi> Ships, all mounted, man'd, and in gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
Equipage for War, they were ſtrong enough,
had they had order, to have kept them out of <hi>Gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Netherlandiſh Fleet</hi> lay a Year and ſome Months
before <hi>Gamron,</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were but a ſmall time
with their foreſaid number of Ships there; whereas
before and after there came other, yea ſingle Ships, to
and fro, and yet according to their own confeſſion no
ſtop or hinderance was done to any of them, ſave on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the Ship called the Merchant of <hi>Bengale</hi> before
mentioned, and of which ſhall be further ſpoken by
and by.</p>
            <p>From whence then is it evinced, that the <hi>Dutch</hi>
Company had ſuch a deſign, or what proofs do they
bring to juſtifie what they depoſe in their foreſaid
Reply? Not one only word.</p>
            <p>But to ſay how the caſe ſtands, the <hi>Netherlandiſh Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany</hi>
undertakes to ſhew, that the ſaid <hi>Kaſembroo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi>
commanding the ſaid Fleet in Chief in the Gulph of
<hi>Perſia,</hi> did all the time of his abode there, by expreſs
order and command, forbid, that no let or hinderance
ſhould in the leaſt be offered to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships in
their Navigation and Traffick in that Kingdom.</p>
            <p>And that the <hi>Dutch</hi> Companies management might
be rendred the more ſuſpected and odious, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
thus in their Triplick, Theſe are the means which
the <hi>Dutch Company</hi> uſeth, for to get great advantages
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:95727:28"/>
upon the <hi>Indian</hi> Princes, yea have thereby conſtrained
that great and mighty King of <hi>Perſia</hi> himſelf to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
ſuch Articles as they would, that he might
have his Havens again open and free.</p>
            <p>But beſides, that the <hi>Netherlandiſh Company</hi> hath not
by all thoſe exceſſive charges, Covenanted or acquired
any greater privileges or advantages than they always
formerly have had in the Kingdom, except only a
diſcharge from taking yearly a quantity of Silk at a
certain price, (at leaſt ſo far as concerns the laſt) accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the advice which the <hi>Dutch Company</hi> lately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
concerning the ſame.</p>
            <p>And in caſe the great Princes of the <hi>Indies,</hi> and the
King of <hi>Perſia</hi> himſelf were ſo eaſily to be forced by
ſuch a Fleet as the <hi>Dutch Company</hi> had there, we have
reaſon to demand why the <hi>Engliſh Company</hi> did not
make uſe of that occaſion, namely when they had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
ſuch a Fleet as they boaſt of before <hi>Gamron,</hi> for
to recover of the <hi>Perſians</hi> payment of the Toll or Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>om
of <hi>Ormus</hi> or <hi>Gamron,</hi> which they ſay was ſo
truly due unto them, but unjuſtly detained by the
<hi>Perſians,</hi> at leaſt as to the greater part thereof, and
which in the year 1654. they demanded, as to the
half thereof, amounting to many hundred thouſand
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of the <hi>Netherlandiſh Company,</hi> to wit, of the
Goods which the ſaid <hi>Dutch Company</hi> until that time
had brought and Negotiated there, but was then by
Committees on both parts denied to be due to them,
and they remitted to the <hi>Perſians</hi> themſelves, where
they ſo often importuned them by their Complaints;
yea, even to the threatning of them; but nevertheleſs
could never obtain any ſatisfaction: Would they not
in all that time wherein theſe pretences have ſince en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
to ſuch vaſt Sums, if it had been to be acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with ſuch facility, have uſed theſe ways and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>? Undoubtedly yea.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:95727:28"/>
And thereby we may well judg, what was the
Conſtitution of that Fleet they had there, and of
which they made ſuch high boaſts.</p>
            <p>But in caſe they ſhould yet attempt the ſame, could
the <hi>Netherlandiſh Company,</hi> although much prejudiced
thereby in their Traffick, as undoubted would ſo be,
could they thereupon lay any action to the charge of
the <hi>Engliſh Company,</hi> and make pretences upon them?</p>
            <p>Surely the <hi>Dutch Company</hi> would wiſh, yea, entreat
in a friendly way, that if ſuch a thing ſhould be, our
Ships might have the like uſage, as the <hi>Dutch Company</hi>
did ſhew to the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the ſecond Complaint, namely the hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
occaſioned to the Ship the <hi>Merchant of Bengale</hi> in
her Unlading, by detaining and diſturbing them in
their Traffick and Undertakings.</p>
            <p>Thus ſtands the caſe: The <hi>Dutch Company,</hi> as hath
been ſaid, having War with the <hi>Perſians,</hi> or being as
they ſay, <hi>In Statu Belli,</hi> and lying with their Fleet
before <hi>Gamron,</hi> there came tidings from Land, that
there was an intent to Board our Fleet by Fire-Ships,
and ſo cauſe us to leave the Road; whereupon we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to ſeize on all the <hi>Perſian</hi> Boats we could get,
and make them faſt behind our Ships: the foreſaid
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship lying in the midſt of our Fleet, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
preparation to unlade in <hi>Perſian</hi> Boats, the ſaid
<hi>Kaſembroot</hi> deſired them to be pleaſed to deſiſt, and not
to make uſe of <hi>Perſian</hi> Boats, eſpecially they being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
to take in their Loding in the night time to
be very early at Land to unlade, we offering them all
the Boats of our Ships to aſſiſt them, that we might be
certain, that they under the cloak of coming to the
foreſaid Ship, with their Fire-Ships, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aſſing by
our Watch, might not before we were aware, fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us; but they of the foreſaid Ship rejecting ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:95727:29"/>
proffer, there came among our Fleet a <hi>Perſian</hi> Boat,
man'd with ten or twelve <hi>Perſian</hi> Rowers, and one
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Mariner, having by him two Caſes with Roſe-water,
which the ſaid <hi>Kaſembroot</hi> cauſed to be brought
into his Ship; the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Interpreter preſently there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
making his Complaint, the former proffer of
our Boats was renewed, and at his going away, bid
to take with him the two Caſes of Roſe-water, which
he refuſing, they were put into his Boat, and ſo he
departed.</p>
            <p>This being the true Hiſtory, we demand, What
herein was done amiſs by the <hi>Dutch Company,</hi> to cauſe
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to make ſuch clamorous complaints about
it? Or whether if any hinderance came thereby to
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> (for damage they had none) they brought
it not upon their own heads?</p>
            <p>The Goods they accuſe us to have taken out of the
<hi>Perſian</hi> Boat (which nevertheleſs they themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
were again reſtored, and put into the Boat where
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Interpreter was) they aggravate, for to
make them, in all appearance, to ſeem of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
were only the foreſaid two Caſes of Roſe-water.</p>
            <p>In the contra-Proteſt, the aforeſaid <hi>Kaſembroot</hi> hath
made againſt the Proteſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> (and to
which they appeal) the whole carriage of the buſineſs
is nakedly and clearly made to appear, for which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
they alſo thought good, as the ſaid Extraordinary
Envoy annexed the ſaid Proteſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to his
foreſaid Memorial, here withal alſo to deliver over this
contra-Proteſt.</p>
            <p>Thereby more plainly to ſhew, firſt, the Proffer
we made of our Boats for their ſervice to unlode their
ſaid Ship, partly to take away the hinderance they
complained of, and on the other hand to prevent the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:95727:29"/>
miſchief, which by the going to and fro of the
Enemies Boats, (which they might have pretended to
be done only in the Name, and by the Order of the
<hi>Engliſh)</hi> could have befallen our Fleet.</p>
            <p>Again, That the Goods taken out of the <hi>Perſian</hi>
Boat, but again reſtored, were nothing but the ſaid

were rather prone thus unjuſtly to accuſe us, that we ſhould
have detained your Goods (which were only the two Caſes

into the Scute wherein he came from Land, at the ſame

them away with him. And foraſmuch as it ſeemeth to be
your wonted manner, by intricate and practiſed Inſertions to

that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> were as yet to be reſponſible unto

                  <p>He gives Reaſons why he did not wait for Orders

but they ſaid to them and the other <hi>Engliſh,</hi> That
if ever they entred more into the Fort, they might
expect nothing elſe but to be fallen upon.</p>
                  <p>That at the very ſame inſtant the <hi>Dutch</hi> Soldiers
and the <hi>Mallayans</hi> began to plunder, carrying away
all they thought was of any worth, and gave it into
the Hands of their Commanders: And while they
were thus pillaging, the <hi>Dutch</hi> Soldiers in contempt,
brake and tore in pieces the Flag of the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
which was ſet up there.</p>
                  <p>That after all theſe Violences, the foreſaid Officer,
by Order of the Commander, prayed him to retire
on the ſide of the <hi>Hollanders;</hi> promiſing in the name
of the Commander, they would reſtore the Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize,
Effects, Silver-work, Cannon, and all what
might appertain to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and what ſhould be

promiſed, anſwered him, He could do nothing in it;
and that what the <hi>Mallayans</hi> had taken, was juſtly
acquired, and they could not be conſtrained to render
the ſame: However, as for the Cannon, he would
endeavour they might be reſtored.</p>

But coming again to him, after he had ordered men
and a Boat to take in the Cannon, there came ſome of
his men and ſaid, That in caſe we would have the
Cannon, the <hi>Mallyans</hi> pretended to have 500 Dollars
for them.</p>
                  <p>Seeing then too apparently, that in this and in all
other things the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were meerly deluded, he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barqued
his Soldiers and Men that were left, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to <hi>Indrapanna</hi> the 25. of <hi>Auguſt.</hi>

                  <p>WE have received your Puiſſant Highneſſes Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and therewith your Reſolution of the
firſt of this preſent, with an inſertion of the Memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
preſented to your Puiſſant Highneſſes, with an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex
by the Marquis of <hi>Albiville,</hi> Envoy Extraordinary
of his Royal Majeſty of <hi>Great Britain;</hi> which ſaid Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial
containeth Complaints againſt the tranſactions
and doings of the Miniſters of the <hi>Netherlandiſh</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
at <hi>Maſlapatam</hi> upon the Coaſt of <hi>Cormandel,</hi> and
at <hi>Batancapas</hi> upon the Weſt Coaſt of <hi>Sumatra,</hi> with
their Requeſt of Reparation; concerning which, your
Puiſſant Highneſſes require information by us. We
may not omit, High and Mighty Lords, to propoſe,
with all dutiful reſpect to your Puiſſant Highneſſes,
That foraſmuch as the ſaid Appendix is in effect the
Contents of ſuch Letters which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company,
as they pretend, have lately received out of the <hi>Indies,</hi>
divers particulars are rehearſed in what manner the
things they complain of were there tranſacted, of
which we, by reaſon our Ships are not yet arrived,
tho expected every hour, cannot have perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg:
May it therefore pleaſe your Puiſſant Highneſſes
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:95727:41"/>
not to conſtrue it amiſs, that we defer the ſame a
while; however we ſay aforehand, that the ſaid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints,
as they are propoſed in the ſaid Memorial, are
of two parts.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Againſt the conduct of our people, in their
actings at <hi>Maſlapatnam:</hi> And ſecondly, upon the Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Coaſt
of <hi>Sumatra,</hi> with the wrong done to the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
at both places.</p>
                  <p>As to the firſt, we apprehend, that by the informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
we had the laſt yeart out of <hi>India,</hi> and by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hand, (ſetting aſide what we are yet expecting)
we want no matter fully to juſtify the tranſactions of
our people there, and to demonſtrate the ungrounded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the foreſaid Complaints.</p>
                  <p>And what concerns the ſecond, namely, That by
force we ſhould have hindred them, that they could,
nor might ſettle themſelves in the Country of the
Prince of <hi>Indrapanna,</hi> nor build Forts where they
pleaſed; whereas that Prince, according to what they
affirm, had made over that Country to them, although
we cannot directly diſcover the perfect ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of that buſineſs, until the Ships, which we
dayly expect be arrived; nevertheleſs, we are able, by
the information we had the laſt year concerning it, to
affirm from the contents of thoſe Letters, That the
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> by reaſon of the unhealthfulneſs of that
Country, and the mortality it brought upon their
men, with other difficulties, were intended, yea, did
actually prepare to depart thence, ſo that we thought
to have mentioned nothing more, nor troubled your
Puiſſant Highneſſes with that buſineſs, but have paſt
it by in ſilence; but ſeeing out the foregoing Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix
we find it otherwiſe, we ſhall nor may not neglect
to produce with the firſt opportunity unto your Puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
Highneſſes our juſt complaints, and withal to ſhew
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:95727:41"/>
the injuries, loſſes and intruſions of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> upon
the propriety and right, which we (as to the Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coaſt)
for a very long time have had and acquired,
and which we yet have the actual poſſeſſion and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of, and can prove, that they continually
have ſought to debauch, and draw from us theſe
Princes, who, in acknowledgment of the benefits and
ſervices they received from us, and amongſt many
other, that we had delivered them, at our exceeding
Charge and Expences, out of the hands of their
Enemies under whoſe yoke they were brought; and
moreover, at whoſe Requeſt we have by ſolemn
Contracts taken upon us, and promiſed to defend
them againſt all and every one who ſhould offer to
do any injury or violence unto them; and for which
they have declared us for their Soveraigns, and in
eſpecial alſo that forementioned Prince of <hi>Indraponna,</hi>
in whoſe Country they have built a Fort, endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forcibly to thruſt us out of our poſſeſſion, by
depriving us of the injoyment we had: And yet they
themſelves confeſs that our people on the Weſt-Coaſt
have proteſted againſt the injuries they did to them,
while they ſought to ſettle themſelves at <hi>Boucoulo</hi> and
<hi>Indraponna,</hi> Countries and places, as the real truth is,
belonging to us, of which the Contracts are in our
hands time out of mind; and yet they cannot deny,
that their people have ſet themſelves againſt us by
building of Forts to keep us out; yea, they complain,
that we, by raiſing a Fort, have injured and prevented
them, and yet this is all the damage and wrong, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their own ſaying, we have done them.
If, indeed, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> could make it out, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that they have a right to come into a Country,
of which the Soveraignty is made over to us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:95727:42"/>
other engagements we have there, tho as
they ſay, by conſent of the ſaid Prince (although
that is not by us owned as true) to build Forts
thereby to draw the Commerce into their hands,
with the ſecluding of us, to whom the right is
only belonging, and yet we not have juſt cauſe,
by raiſing a Fort to prevent them; or that hereby
they ſhould have a main Action againſt us: Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
this muſt needs come from another Law than
hitherto hath been known to the World. They
accuſe us, that we, by <hi>privative</hi> Contracts, have
ſought every where to keep them from Trading,
and yet they make their Appeal to ſuch like Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
which themſelves have made there. The
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Company ſhews, that they wilfully continue
in their cuſtom, to make always complaints, how
impertinent or ungrounded ſoever, thereby to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>occupy
the World, yea, to make an impreſſion even
in the Inhabitants of this State it ſelf, as if we
ſought nothing elſe, but made it our whole buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to oppoſe and be thwarting of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as
amongſt other their complaints, this alſo may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently
be ſeen in the buſineſs of <hi>Bantam,</hi> which
occaſioned ſuch commotion and clatter almoſt in all
places, and concerning which, the Information ſtated
by this Chamber above a year ago, and preſented
to your Puiſſant Highneſſes, hath clearly mani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eſted
what is to be judged of the carriage and conduct
of the <hi>Netherlandiſh</hi> Company in that matter, which
in the firſt was ſo odiouſly ſet forth. But foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as it is our intention, after the arrival of our
Ships, whoſe return from the <hi>Indies</hi> we dayly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
more amply, by the permiſſion of your Puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
Highneſſes, to treat of theſe and other things,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:95727:42"/>
when we ſhall have further light by the evidences
we expect in thoſe Ships, and to ſhew the injuries
offered us; we will herewith conclude, praying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
