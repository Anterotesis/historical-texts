         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

in time to come, and of a readier diſpatch
of Publique Deſignes then formerly, doth encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
me to offer to the view of the Publique theſe
Motions, which haply may finde acceptance; if
not ſo farre as to be ſet up by Authority; yet to be underſtood by
private Perſons, that they may finde their Conveniencie
therein.</p>
            <p>They concerne, as thou maiest ſee, chiefly the Advantages of
Husbandry, to remedie ſome Defects and Diſorders, which are
found therein; and to lay the foundations of Trade and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
to increaſe the ſame; and all this by ſome Orderly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances,
which may produce incredible Effects, if rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
and attended. If I ſhould intend to lay open the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievouſneſſe
of Diſorderlineſſe and Confuſion, I might fill a
Volume; it is either the root or the effect of all the evils of this
<pb facs="tcp:49516:3"/>
World; whether they afflict our Soul or our Body, and concern
our private or our publick Relations; and to bring our ſelves
and our affairs into a righteous Order, is the great Work which
every one ſhould attend within himſelf; and the greateſt good
which can be procured at any time unto others; and at this time
unto the Publique: it is therefore incumbent to all, equally to
ſerve one another herein, according to their utmoſt ability; and
except all concur to order themſelves aright both within
themſelves, and towards each other, we cannot be throughly
happy nor ſetled in any courſe ſuccesfully, becauſe it is in Humane
Societies almoſt as in a Watch; except all the Wheels be not only
ſound and well ſetled upon their own axle-trees; but fitly ordered
to correſpond with each other, there can be no Univerſall Motion,
becauſe the diſorderlineſs of one will diſturbe many from acting
in their Spheres; ſo it fals out in moſt matters of Humane So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
chiefly in Trade, and in ſome points alſo of Husbandry, as
by this following Diſcourſe will appear. Therefore, that which
one ſays is to be heeded; <hi>Quod omnes tangit ab omnibus cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri
debet. That which is the concernment of all, ought to
be the care of all;</hi> but no man can make this to be ſo; except the
ſpirits of men be raiſed to a pitch anſwerable to the worth of
things offered unto them. For as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith, <hi>Magno animo
de rebus magnis judicandum eſt; alias illarum vitium eſſe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debitur
quod noſtrum eſt. Great Matters are to be weighed
with a raiſed minde, otherwiſe the fault will ſeem to be in
them, which is in our ſelves.</hi> And although theſe things may
perhaps ſeem to ſome, of no great moment, yet if they be lookt
into duly, they will be found ſuch, as have an influence, upon the
Fundamentalls of the Settlement of Common-wealths. For if
Husbandry, and Trade at home and abroad be well regulated; all
hands may be Employed, and where all hands are at work, there
the whole ſtrength of a Nation, doth put forth its endeavours,
for its own advantage, which if it can be directed to do in an
<pb facs="tcp:49516:3"/>
Orderly Way; and with a joynt Concurrence of all parts to one
and the ſame effect; it is not to be imagined how ſucceſful ſuch
an Undertaking may be; As for myſelf, I have in my ſtation bin
faithful to offer Objects of this and ſome other kinde unto the
Publike, to provoke every one to minde the beſt things for their
own and the Publike Good; and although in this endevour, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
for many years I have continued in the midſt of ſome difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and all our Changes, and have ſpent my ſelf thereupon as
upon a neceſſary duty; yet I have found no great Encouragement
thereunto from abroad, more then what mine own reſolution (to
perſevere faithful unto the end in well doing) did ſuggeſt unto
me; nevertheleſs I hope I ſhall not faint. For I hope the Lord
will continue me in the Apoſtles minde, that I may ſay
from my heart, 2 <hi>Cor. 12. 15, 16. That I will very gladly
ſpend and be ſpent for the good of others,</hi> although for the
moſt part it proves a thankleſs office, and the more abundantly
one is found to love the Publike; the leſs he is loved: Yet let
it be ſo with me; I ſhall not at any time ſeek to burden any man,
but rather ſet my ſelf in doing things freely by this kinde of
Craft to catch men by their own advantages, to minde the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
and do good one to another as ſervants of each other through
love; for herein is the Law of Jeſus Chriſt fulfilled, and his
Kingdom advanced amongst us, when upon ſuch a ground truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unto him, we do all our Affairs heartily for his ſake, and not
as ſerving Men only or Our ſelves. And that thou mayeſt
Chriſtian Reader be inabled to walk in all thy Ways by this Rule,
is the Upright deſire of him, who ſhall always profeſs himſelf,</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Here preſent you with a
plain Diſcovery of that pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentiall
Contrivance for
the more advantageous ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
out of Lands, which I
have formerly acquainted
you with, and as you know
offered in vain to ſome of
the Company of Drayners
of the great Fen, as I had
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49516:7"/>
opportunity; That ſo I may not onely gratifie your
Publique-heartedneſſe and great Zeal for the Common
good, and teſtific my willingneſſe to be doing ſome
good in my generation, as God ſhall enable me, but
that I may in ſome ſort be blameleſſe to all Poſterity,
though thoſe Lands be not well divided or ſub-divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
ſince I have not onely offered my aſſiſtance, ſuch
as it is in private, but do here (and ſuppoſe not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
too late) freely offer it to the conſideration of all
men that are, or may be concerned in the ſame, or the
like nature, of what better uſe Lands divided, or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided,
according to the Plats here intended to every
mans view may be found or eſteemed. And leſt any
miſtake ſhould be in the not rightly underſtanding my
meaning, or the nature of the thing, give me leave to
trouble the World with a few of my Reaſons for, or
apprehenſions of that Advantage or Conveniency,
which may be more had and obtained by following
this Example.</p>
                  <p>I have been even called to a more then ordinary uſe
of, and love to all ſorts of Husbandry, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to Agriculture, wherein God hath been graciouſly
pleaſed to recompence my <hi>Zeal,</hi> and indeavour with
an increaſe of knowledge and experience in the wayes
of managing Agriculture and Husbandry; in all its
parts; and that not onely according to what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
known and practiſed, but by ſome Additionals,
which if well accepted, and rightly purſued, would tend
exceedingly to the proſperity, honour and plenty of
this whole Nation; but of this, as I have formerly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
you more largely (for you have thought fit to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49516:7"/>
hint it to the World in your <hi>Reformed Husbandman</hi>)
I ſhall therefore proceed and ſay, that that dear and even
naturall affection which I have to Husbandry, above
all other employments among men, may (perhaps)
have occaſioned my further enquiry into theſe affairs;
and by thoſe obſervations to which I have given my
ſelfe more then every man, I may have attained to far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
inſight then every man hath troubled himſelf to
take, which I freely preſent to my Native Countrey,
at leaſt ſo much as concerns the matter here in Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
namely, <hi>The ſetting out of Land, as to the beſt
Forme.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have obſerved that all or moſt part of the Lands,
Lordſhips, Mannors, Pariſhes, Farmes, and particular
Grounds, or Cloſes in <hi>England</hi> are not (or rather were
not at that time paſt, when they were firſt) ſet out in
any good Forme; too much of <hi>England</hi> being left as
waſte ground in Commons, Mores, Heaths, Fens, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes,
and the like, which are all Waſte Ground; but
ſome more, ſome leſſe; ſome being made a little better
uſe of then others; but all capable of very great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement,
as not now yielding (not one of forty of
them through <hi>England</hi>) the one fourth part of that
profit either to private or publique, which they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively
capable of.</p>
                  <p>I have obſerved in all places in <hi>England</hi> the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences
that come by the Want of Encloſure,
both to private and publique, the irregularity of theſe
Lands that are incloſed, the frequent, and (as things
now ſtand in relation to time paſt, and Land already ſet
out) unremediable intanglements or intermixture of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49516:8"/>
Intereſt of ſeverall perſons in the ſame Common, in
the ſame Field, in the ſame Cloſe, nay ſometimes in
the ſame Acre. The inconvenient paſſages made or
allowed between divers grounds, and that not onely,
when they belong to ſeverall men, but even when one
man is owner of divers grounds; and the truth is, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he that is poſſeſt of Lands, is a Lord or Tenant; if
Lord, he ſeldome alters that Form he found his Lands
in, whether he received them by Inheritance, or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe;
and if but Tenant, he would count it (for the
moſt part) loſt labour, although he did indeed under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
both the inconvenience and the right remedy:
but I fear neither Lord nor Tenant do ſo, or at leaſt
ſo, as to lay to heart the Croſſes or Loſſes they or
their neighbours do too frequently ſuſtain meerly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this accompt, or are too careleſſe or deſperate of
the remedie.</p>
                  <p>I have obſerved the careleſſeneſſe and wickedneſſe
of Servants and bad neighbours both; which a man
ſhall be ſure to meet, let him remove as often, and to
what place he will.</p>
                  <p>I have obſerved the proneneſs moſt of Cattel &amp; Poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
to break into forbidden places, but above all others,
commonly kept in <hi>England</hi> (not to ſpeak of Deer and
Goats, or of wilde fowl, or the like) Swine, Coneys,
and Pigeons, (and ſome ſorts of Poultry, at ſome
ſeaſons) are moſt inclined to and frequent actors of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief,
and that ſo great, that men dare hardly conſider
it ſeriouſly, but let it paſſe to avoid vexation.</p>
                  <p>Who is it that lives a Countrey-life, but knowes,
or may know, and upon enquiry finde, that one pair of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49516:8"/>
old Pigeons eates of one ſort or another of Corn,
and grain in the year at leaſt 6 buſhels, &amp; that there are
almoſt (if not altogether) as many ſuch pairs of Pidge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as there are men, women and children in <hi>England,</hi>
and it is plain, they can get none, but either of what
you have ſowne, or of what you ſhould reap, or of the
ſheadings in the field, which were better beſtowed on
your Swine or Poultry, or out of your barne, or rick,
or threſhing-floor, from whence I ſuppoſe you cannot
well ſpare it, or from the manger, ſtanding racks, or
dunghill, all which your pigs and hens muſt want ſo
much. I conclude as to this Creature, that there is no
ſuch enemy to the proſperity of <hi>England,</hi> of his bigneſs
ſo little taken notice of, or that yields ſo little return;
nay I dare affirm, that all the beaſts &amp; fouls in <hi>England,</hi>
(wilde fowl, which we cannot ſo eaſily prevent, and
Swine, and Coneys, which yet return abundantly more
profit excepted) do not equalize the loſſe and damage
ſuffered by this one ſort of ſmall birds; but let this
ſerve by way of digreſſion, for the truth is, the Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
here principally intended is for the better caſting
out of Lordſhips or Farmes in point of Forme, and
doth no other way remedy this, but as it contracts your
buſineſſe into a cloſe order, making it as eaſie to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and chaſe away this enemy in one ground, as in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
which is not commonly to be done in other
places.</p>
                  <p>The next deſtructive Cattel are Coneys, they will
eat down the Corn at the firſt coming up, ſometimes
to its deſtruction, they will eat it down all along till
Harveſt, and if it yet proſper in part, they will ſtand on
their hinder legs, and crop off the ear juſt at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49516:9"/>
and leave the ſtraw ſtanding, I have ſeen ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
fields in a confiderable part ſo ſerved, they will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
young Woods, by eating the bark away round
about a foot high, and in good meadow and paſture
make a thouſand croſſe paths, and in all grounds dig
holes under the roots of trees, corn, &amp;c. to a very great
prejudice; and this evill is ſomething the worſe, in that
there is no Fence in the common way againſt them, but
the dog or gun, which is not alwayes allowed,
yet to do this little beaſt right, it is not his fault but his
Maſters, or thoſe that keeps him in no better order, for
I do affirm, that few Creatures under heaven, (as they
may be managed) turn to greater profit to the Owners,
and yet may they be kept (all things conſidered) cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and (in a manner) free from doing any hurt to his
Owners, or their Neighbours; and ſo become a moſt
pleaſant, profitable, harmleſſe creature. And thus
to manage this Creature is moſt properly to be done
by ſuch, whoſe Lands are divided, or ſub-divided into
ſome ſuch Forme as theſe Charts expreſſe, and in ſuch
a Farme it is not uneaſie to make theſe Creatures to do
ſome eſpeciall ſervices even in his life-time.</p>
                  <p>The third moſt harmfull beaſt is the Swine, a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ſo ravenous, that children are ſcarce ſafe from a
lean ſow that hath pigs, and for her to eat her own pigs
is no very ſtrange thing; and to eat your Turkeys or
Goſlings a thing often ſeen. And as Swine are order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
there is hardly any thing ſafe from them; how will
they break through almoſt any hedge, not onely eat,
but root up &amp; deſtroy the Corn abundantly, as likewiſe
any graſs, trees, plants, or whatever corn is in their way,
or they can come at? what and how great and frequent
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49516:9"/>
are the loſſes abroad, and the naſty inconveniencies at
home occaſioned by this Creature? And herein they
differ, and are worſe then all other Cattle, that when
they are in the corn they are not eaſily ſeen, and (if
their owners or keepers miſſe them not) as too many
of thoſe that are called poor people, will not onely
willingly not miſſe them, but (I have ſeen it, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
by it) will on ſet purpoſe drive them thither by
which means they will ſometimes get a haunt of a piece
of corn, and go into it ſo cunningly, that a man can
ſcarce finde where, but being a good way in, they will
deſtroy wholly great ſpots of a rod or two together,
and when a man ſhall diſcover them, he had almoſt as
good let them alone, for without a dog they will but
play bo-peep, and be running from place to place, but
trample down and ſpoil more, and ſo they will do a
good while alſo, though you have a dog. Seriouſly,
Sir, I ſuppoſe, that though the Hog being fat, and dead
is excellent meat, and of ſo large a body, and good
price that he may be worth ſome pounds, yet there is
not one Hog of ten, but (beſides the corn given him,
after put up to fat) hath one way or other loſt, ſpoiled,
deſtroyed, or devoured twice his price. Moſt of which
inconveniences, as well the naſtineſſe as the dammage
is almoſt totally prevented by the right Uſe of this
Contrivance, which if, I may truely ſay, that with
ſome additions to the Common, or for the better ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of this Cattle, they are of exceeding Uſe
and Profit equall to Cowes, Sheep, or any other, if
not much beyond; but indeed all Cattle almoſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
ſo neceſſarily on one anothers fellowſhip, that he
that keeps one hath good reaſon to keep all; (but if any
alone, Sheep.)</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:49516:10"/>
The fourth neceſſary ſort of Creature fit to be about
a Farme, is Poultry of all ſorts; whether Water-fowl,
as Geeſe, Ducks, &amp;c. or Land-fowl, as Turkeys, Hens,
&amp;c. The firſt ſort are of ſpeciall Uſe, and require more
care then charge in the keeping, which care is eaſed ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much by this Contrivance, and thoſe many ill turns,
not unuſually done by Geeſe, prevented with an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
given to breed or keep many more without
charge. The ſecond ſort are exceeding profitable, if
bred and fed according to a ſafe and orderly Rule in a
place convenient, allowing a large walk, yet prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the harme they are apt to do. I am aſſured both by
reaſon and experience, that very great profit above all
charge may be had without much trouble by them that
keep great ſtore of theſe ſorts ſafe and well, which I
conceive will be much facilitated by this Contrivance.</p>
                  <p>All other greater Cattel, as Horſes and Mares, &amp;c.
Buls, Cowes and Oxen, &amp;c. and all ſorts of Sheep, as
they are apt to run into every Meadow, better paſture,
or corn-grounds they can come at: ſo are they eaſier
ſeen or prevented; and beſides, it troubles a man leſſe
to make ſatisfaction to his Neighbour, or to bear his
own loſſe patiently, when he conſiders, that ſuch Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
many times (though not alwayes) are the better for
what they have eaten, and may ſhortly one way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
make him ſome amends, either by their fat, or
Fleece, or milk, or labour, or the like, whereas all the
Pigeon, the lean Hog, or the Coney gets irregularly
is meerly loſt.</p>
                  <p>And the evill Contrivance and Inter-mixture of
wayes and Intereſts in moſt places of <hi>England</hi> is a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
reaſon, which many, even of the more Ingenious
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49516:10"/>
ſort of men, that would fain yet do not attempt or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
thoſe many, great, and viſible wayes of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
improvement that are in nature, and in view, and
that becauſe they have no place ſecure enough, but
may every day one before the other expect, that the
careleſneſſe or wickedneſſe of their Neighbours, or
their own children, or ſervants (yea, and by miſtake
ſometimes themſelves) may let in all or any ſorts of
theſe beaſts or fowls, (worſt of all Hogs or Coneys,
which in the common way have moſt liberty and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity)
to deſtroy all their labours and charges in an
inſtant; therefore ſay they (not very wiſely nor indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriouſly
though) it is better ſit ſtil then riſe up and fall.</p>
                  <p>Whereas if <hi>Engliſh</hi> men would be reſolutely and
ingeniouſly induſtrious by this, or ſome other, or bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Contrivance, Way, or Means (which I ſhall gladly
ſubſcribe to, when I ſee it) thoſe dangers may be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and this Nation become in an age or two, as much
(almoſt) beyond what it now is, as it now is beyond
<hi>Scotland</hi> for fertility, or <hi>Ireland</hi> for good Husbandry.
And we need hardly be beholden to any Nation under
heaven for any of their Commodities, except <hi>Spaniſh</hi>-Wines
and Spices, or ſome ſuch things, of which we
have no ſimple neceſſity.</p>
                  <p>I have obſerved, that in moſt parts of <hi>England,</hi> eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
in Champion Countreys, the Paſtures lie neer
home, and the Woods, Meads, and Corn-land lie at a
great diſtance. And ſomething like it in incloſed
grounds alſo, and that it is common to go through one
Cloſe into another, whereas it is plain, that the corne
or graſſe in the firſt Cloſe is liable to be eaten and tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
down by the Cattle that paſſe to and again to the
Cloſe beyond it. It is alſo very plain, that all Cattle
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49516:11"/>
that are well, luſty, and not of immediate Uſe, are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to carry themſelves to a greater diſtance, but that
Wood, Corn, Hey, or the like, require much time,
charge and pains to remove them; I appeal therefore,
whether it be not fitter to ſend ſuch Cattle further off,
and have your Corn and Hey, (and Wood too, if need
be) neerer home. And for your young, ſick or weak,
or infected Cattle in this Contrivance, there is provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
made for ſuch; as alſo for your Milch-Cowes at
Milking-time, ſo well, that till I ſee ſome better I reſt
contented with this.</p>
                  <p>I have obſerved, that when the foul or home-ſted is
too neer the dwelling houſe (as it is in moſt places) it
makes the Inhabitants liable to many inconveniences,
and offenſive ſights and ſmels, as well within doors, as
without; but here I refer my ſelfe whether that evil is
not remedied, and yet the Barns, Stables, &amp;c. neer e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
for inſpection, which is all the reaſon for their
being neer; for as you have it in this Contrivance, you
may at all time swith caſe view and take accompt of
your buſineſſe, and yet be as neat and ſweet as in a <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gemaſters</hi>
houſe in <hi>Holland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Finally, here your houſe ſtands in the middle of all
your little world (which you may build as your purſe
and fancy directs, though I could ſay ſomething as to
that in particular, which I take to be as effectuall if need
were) encloſed with the Gardens and Orchards, refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the beauty and odour of the bloſſomes, fruits
and flowers, and the ſweet melody of the chirping
birds, that again encompaſt with little Cloſes, that all
young, weak, or ſick Cattle may be foſtered under
your own eye without loſſe or inconvenience, and all
bound together as with a girdle, (and ſurely never had
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49516:11"/>
the old proverb, ungirt, unbleſt, a fitter or fuller ſenſe
or application) and all that covered again, as with a fair
large cloak of Meadow and Tillage, to which you may
commit the corner paſturage, the Cape if you pleaſe,
or the Sleeves to the Coat (for a Coat as well as a Cloak
will ſerve to cover either knavery or foolery) of old cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes
or negligence. Here you have your Bake-houſe
Brew-houſe, Darie, or the like; your Barns, Stables,
and Out-houſes in ſuch apt places as may ſerve indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
for all your occaſions. And no one ground to
paſſe through into another, no probability of being
treſpaſſed upon by others, or by your own, but the moſt
perfect right and ample Uſe of every foot of ground
incloſed entire, by all which (I doubt not) will make
good what I have ſometimes affirmed; that beſides all
other wayes of Improvement that may be farther ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
this alone in meer point of Contrivance is enough
to improve the value of your Eſtate one half part; <hi>viz.</hi>
that if it were really worth 100 <hi>li. per annum</hi> before,
it will thus become as really worth 150 <hi>li. per annum,</hi>
and the charge in caſting it into this forme, (eſpecially
where no fences are already) little more, in ſome caſes
not ſo much, though I muſt tell you, you cannot ſpare
in any caſe more unhappily then here. And beſides
profit, the caſe and pleaſure will be better felt then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt
in words.</p>
                  <p>Very much more might be ſaid in order to this, but
it would too farre exceed the bounds of a Letter, and
it is alſo not amiſſe to ſee how the World will accept
or reject this firſt: From the hands of him, who ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes

                  <head>An Experiment for the multiplying
of Corn, practiſed neer Paris in France, by ſome
of that new order of Friers, who are there
called Peres de lâ doctrine Chreſtienne.</head>
                  <p>INto two French pintes of rain-water, they did put a
certain quantity of Cow-dung well rotted, and as
much Sheeps-dung and pigeons dung. This water
they boiled, till but half a pinte was left, then they
ſtrained it through a linnen cloth, and in it diſſolved 3
ſmall handfuls of common ſalt, and as much Salt Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
This brine they ſet in ſome veſſel upon hot aſhes,
and in it they ſteeped their Seed-corn; which being
ſo ordered, and at the uſuall ſeed-time, being put into
barren ground<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> produced unuſuall increaſe, I my ſelfe
have ſeen one hundred and fourteen eares upon one
root, which, they told me, came from one ſingle corn
ſo prepared. This way of theirs differs not much
from that which I found in an old Manuſcript, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
diſlike. Take, ſaith he, rain-water that hath ſtood
in ſome pool or pond till it putrifie. Put into it good
ſtore of dung of horſes, kine, ſheep, goats, pigeons,
hens, and any other beaſt or bird that feeds upon graſs
or ſeeds. <hi>An quia herbarum, &amp; ſeminum Vita media
vegetativa in ſtercoribus illis reſtiterit exaltanda?</hi> Set
this mixture eight dayes in the Sun, (or if you be in
haſte, boil it over the fire half an hour, ſtirring it all the
while,) afterward ſtrain it, and then make it ſtronger by
putting into it more of the foreſaid ſorts of dung the
ſecond time. This having ſtood as before, ſtrain out,
and put into it ſome common ſalt, and a little Ox-gall.
Into this liquor put your ſeed-corn; float or ſcum off
all the light corns that ſwim; let the reſt lie in the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49516:12"/>
24 houres. Then take out your ſeed-corn, and
ſpread it thin upon a linnen cloth, and dry it in the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow.
Put this ſeed into barren ground (for in ſuch it
will thrive better then in a rich ſoil) you ſhall reap at
leaſt an hundred-fold.</p>

                  <head>Another Secret worthy to be tryed by all
ſuch as are lovers of the Advancement of Husbandry.</head>
                  <p>IN the choice of ſeed-corn, prefer that wheat which
is moſt weighty, as being more maſculine and fitter
for generation then the lighter graines. In the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of plants, the earth is conſidered as a female,
whoſe ſterility may be much helped by the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
melioration of the ſeed; As if you take water,
which hath bin made fat with horſdung wel rotted, and
afterwards diſſolve in it as many pounds of <hi>Sal terrae</hi> as
you intend to ſowe acres. In this water ſteep the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
weighty ſeed for 24 hours. So ſhall you have a
better crop then uſuall, though you ſowe but halfe the
uſuall quantity of ſeed, and though your ground be
not ſo often ploughed, nor be at all dunged; nay though
it were barren of it ſelfe. Your harveſt will be ripe
ſooner by a moneth, and by reaſon of the Salt-peter,
this corn will be fitter for ſtore-houſes; for there it
will lie ten years uncorrupted.</p>

                  <p>COncerning the <hi>Experiment</hi> from <hi>Paris</hi> about
ſteeping of Corn, I have told you heretofore
that ſteeping of Barley is uſed in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

 all ſoile, (except Drake) and alſo all light corn,
further to accelerate growth, if it be ſowne late; and
further, if pigeons dung be added, it may be as good as
half a dunging; and I think I ſpeak high enough, for that
little ſtrength that Corn draweth by this ſteeping can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
do wonders: and if all that Salt, Niter, Cow-dung,
Sheeps, Pigeons dung, of this brine were caſt upon the
earth, it would not dung a quarter of it, how then can
the Extract do ſo much? I cannot as yet ſee any great
reaſon for it, unleſſe perchance there be ſome occult vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vification
of the ſpirits of the Seed, which as yet I am
ignorant o, As for an 114 ears of Corn from one, it's
nothing: I have had from Oats 140 without any ſteep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or ſuch doings; yet I have uſed ſome Art, which
I may call a Secret; for I am perſwaded very few can
do it: but I'le tell it you, and I would all the World
did know, for it is a trifle: <hi>viz.</hi> when the Corn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth
to ſpread, to lay either clods or Tileſhards, or
any broad thing upon it to cauſe it to ſpread, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
let not any corn grow within a foot and a half of
it; and this is the great buſineſſe which every one may
try (the lands alſo ought to be excellently good.) Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
I have had above 2000 grains for one, or of one cut
in the midſt, and above 100 in one car without ſteeping.</p>
                  <p>As to the ſecond Experiment of Brine, I think of it
as of the former; onely I think it convenient to adde,
that firſt they are to blame, who think to medicine the
earth as Phyſicians do the Body, and therefore adde
ſuch varieties of Dungs, as Cows, Pigeons, Horſe,
Sheep, &amp;c. as ſo many <hi>Radices, Folia, Fructus, Semina,
&amp;c.</hi> and then adde Salt and Niter as Phycſiians do Gin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and Mace, then a little Salt and Oxe-gall, as they
do Musk and Amber-greeſe; then boil and ſtrain them
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49516:13"/>
                     <hi>Cape colaturam, &amp; diſſolve ut prius.</hi> I for my part think
that our old Grandame the Earth ought not thus to be
nurſed, and ſuppoſe there is more vanity in theſe then
in the Apothecaries Bills. Secondly, Niter is coſtly:
I fear the Crop will not pay the charges; for that I
ſuppoſe the Countrey-man will conſider, though our
projecting Husbandman do not. Thirdly, that it's
a vanity to overcharge any liquor with too great a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of materials. For we know that the power of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
thing is finite, and if you put Salt into water, ſuch
a proportion it will diſſolve, if you put above that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion,
it ſinketh to the bottome, and there lies undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved.
Fourthly, that the cauſe of Fruitfulneſſe is
not onely the <hi>vita media</hi> in dung; for when it is totally
corrupted, and the <hi>vita media</hi> gone, it is very fruitfull:
further, Chalke, Marle, Nitre, which are exceeding
fruitfull, have no <hi>vita media.</hi> But concerning Fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
I have ſent you a ſhort Diſcourſe which is onely
to ſhew you the difficulty of the Queſtion, and to ſtir
up ſome other to attempt it.</p>
                  <p>As for the Concluſion of the proceſſe (or Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
<hi>viz.</hi> you ſhall reap an 100 fold: let me but dig
Land, if it be not extreamly barren, I'le wager to have
the ſame increaſe without all theſe ſlibber ſlops.</p>
                  <p>As to the laſt Proceſſe which I like beſt, having the
greateſt probabilities; I anſwer, that to get this <hi>Sal
Terrae</hi> to ſupply every mans occaſion, is more then I
know how to obtain, and the trouble great; and I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
he that hath that Salt needeth not horſe-dung; for

to know how he would extract it, and how it differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

the graines will be excellent and long laſting.</p>

Diviſion, or ſetting out of Land, as to the beſt form.
With an Expoſition of the words Sal Terrae, what is to be
underſtood by them in the fore-mentioned Experiment of
Husbandry.</head>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>IN obedience to your Commands, I ſhall thus proceed to
give you further hints of the Advantages that may be had
by caſting Lands into ſome ſuch Forme, as the Plot or
Card Preſented you with formerly, doth more fully ſhew.
If you ſet your houſe in the Centre of your Lordſhip, or
great Farme, then are you equally diſtant (in a manner) to all
the parts thereof, which I take to be no ſmall conveniencie.
Againſt this I know it may be objected, that (eſpecially in
ſuch a place as the great Fenne) it will then be too far from the
great Dreynes, neer unto which it hath been thought fit to
ſet the Houſes, that Boats may come to the door, which they
may as well do, being with ſmall charge let into your houſe,
which charge or trouble being ſet againſt thoſe other incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences
of ſuch as are made or continued by ſetting
the houſe at the end of the Land for the Dreynes ſake,
will be found: inconſiderable. For Example. The common
way of caſting out their Levels or Proportions for Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are into pieces of 100 acres; (this is taken from
the level in the Iſle of <hi>Axholm,</hi> the caſting out of the hundred
in the great Fen being worſe then that;) this runs backwards
from the great Dreyn, where your Houſe ſtands, at leaſt
2200 yards, and all the paſſage you have to any of your
grounds is through all that is between that part and the
Houſe, ſo that part of your work or Harveſt lies a long
mile from home. Now the ſame proportion of 100 Acres
being caſt in a ſquare Forme, the equall ſides will be about
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49516:15"/>
127 rods; the half of which is about 64 Rods from the
Drayne to the Houſe or Centre of your Land, to which
to caſt a ditch from the main Dreyne of 15 foot wide, and
as deep as the Dreyn, may coſt, ſay 5 <hi>ſhil. per</hi> Rod, which is
too much, it amounts but to 16 <hi>li.</hi> and you have as good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
by boat, as if your Houſe had ſtood on the grand
Dreyn and better. 'Tis true, every Houſe that ſtands behinde
you, which are two in number more, upon the ſame length,
will coſt juſt as much more either of them, but with that
charge once for all, they are fitted with boatage for ever, and
the whole land laid ſo much more dry. Now put in the other
ſcale the Conveniencies and Profits, or prevention of loſſe
or charge (thus:) whereas before all your ground ſowed with
corn, or lying for meadow, ſaving that next your Houſe,
muſt have coſt you double, treble, quadruple, I, five times,
ſix times in ſome caſes, as far carriage as the ſame will do now,
as oft in the day, week, moneth, year, or all years to come,
as you ſhall have occaſion; which well conſidered, is a moſt
caſie purchaſe. Secondly, as oft as your ſelf or your ſervants
have occaſion to go to any of the farther Cloſes, much time
muſt be loſt in going and comming, which might have been
much better ſpent. Thirdly, you cannot drive any Cattel to
the fartheſt Cloſes, if they ſhould lie for graſſe, for which
they are fitteſt, but through thoſe neerer, which then may
be ſowed with Corn; and it is not eaſie to foreſee the loſſe
you may ſuſtain by the careleſſeneſſe of ſervants by ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Laſtly, (for there are many other Inconveniences and
Wayes to loſſe, which for brevities ſake I omit) if your own
Cattel be gotten into your own Corn, or your bad neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
into either Corn, Meadow, or Paſtures, they are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
ſo ſoon diſcovered at ſo great diſtances, <hi>as that form
allowes,</hi> and to put them out will prove half a dayes work
almoſt; all which put together, will ſo abundantly repay that
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49516:15"/>
ſmall Charge, that I ſuppoſe I need enforce this no farther;
and I believe, that the Landlord need not be at all the charge;
for the Tenants conveniencie will invite him to bear a great
part of it; for here as you ſee by the Card ſtriking a Circle
from your Houſe, at the Centre as wide as your Square will
admit, all your land (except the Corners, which are deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
for paſture for your ſtronger Cattel, and of leaſt preſent
uſe) will be at one and the ſame diſtance from you, and the
fartheſt (if there were any fartheſt) but the Semidiameter of
your Circle, which is but 350 yards, or ſeventeen ſcore and
ten to the fartheſt end thereof, and but 130 yards, or ſix
ſcore and ten to the neareſt end; the carriage alike eaſie and
ſhort, the inſpection and uſe or drift alike eaſie and of quick
diſpatch, and no going through any one into the other, but
having all in ſo cloſe an order, and ſo ready at your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
for all purpoſes, that you will be incouraged to make
more or better then common Uſes of ſome parts of your
Land, which may turne to your profit exceedingly, if you
be but a little vigilant. If your ground being either ſand (or
any thing but boggy, moriſh, or peat Land) then may you
plant Hedges, Orchards, Gardens, &amp;c. your Houſe ſtands
in the midſt, (which alſo I would build round, which Forme
I ſuppoſe to be of moſt beauty, uſe, and leaſt coſt to him
that will give his minde to conſider it rightly) I would allow
for the ſituation of my Houſe, and ſome Gardens next it, of
the delicater ſort half an Acre of Land, and next without
that for Orchards and Kitchin-Gardens, at leaſt one Acre,
and one half, or two Acres more, both caſt into a round
forme, one encompaſſing the other (for which and all that
follow, I refer, to the ſight of the Card it ſelf, which ſets
it forth more fully to the eye) without that again, I would
allow 9 Acres to be divided into ſeverall little Cloſes for the
Uſes in the Card mentioned; ſome bigger, ſome leſſer, as
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49516:16"/>
I ſhould ſee cauſe; and to binde all this together, I would
again encompaſſe all thoſe with one undivided ring, which
ſhould contain about four Acres (deducting out of all theſe
proportions reſpectively ſo much as was taken up with or in
hedges, ditches, walls, &amp;c.) double fenced, inwards from
the little Cloſes round about, and outward from the laſt
Circle of great Cloſes, out of every of which great Cloſes
(all of them at their neerer or ſmaller ends, <hi>butting</hi> upon this
ring) I would have a bridge or gate ſtrong and ſtanch, that I
might let in what I would; but that nothing might get in
without my leave. I would have from my Houſe four equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
quartered out-paſſages to this Middle ring, and from that
again ſtraight forwards to the Outſide of my Lands well
ditched, gated, fenced; I would ſet my Bake-houſe, Brew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe,
Waſh-houſe, Darie, or the like, without the ſecond
Circle, <hi>viz.</hi> juſt without my Kitchin-Garden and Orchards,
and within or at the neerer end to the Houſe of the little
Cloſes, and for the ſide of the Houſe, as whether to ſet this
on the North, or that on the South, &amp;c. of the dwelling-Houſe,
I leave to every mans diſcretion. As for my Barnes,
Stables, or Houſes, if any Swine-coates, Hen-houſes, Malt-Kilnes,
and all that uſually is called, or belongs to a <hi>Fold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead,</hi>
as rackes to feed Cattel without doors, &amp;c. I would
place at ſuch quarters as I thought fit, ſome at one quarter,
ſome at another, but all on the girdle or middle ring, in or
on which I would alſo make ſo many Coney-berries (where
the ground will any way bear it) as I can fore-ſee, can there
live, and be well maintained; where note; that they are not
onely to be maintained by the graſſe growing on the ring it
ſelfe; but at diſcretion to be let into all or any the other
great or ſmall Cloſes, at ſuch times, and for ſuch purpoſes,
as I ſhall finde convenient and ſafe, and when they ſhall do
me good ſervice and no hurt, and not otherwiſe; upon which
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49516:16"/>
tearmes alſo I will let in my ſheep, hogs, poultry, &amp;c. ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them all alwayes at command to be driven out again at
pleaſure, when they can do no more good, or are like to do
hurt there; thus will my dung be bred in ſuch places, from
whence with eaſe I can diſtribute it either inwards to my Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards
and Gardens, or outwards to my tillage, &amp;c. with
wonderfull eaſe.</p>
                  <p>Thus ſhall my Houſes not be in ſuch eminent danger all
at once, in caſe of any unfortunate fire; thus will thoſe kindes
of naſtineſſe, which is in many places too frequent, be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and yet the uttermoſt part of my Foldſtead for inſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
not above fiveſcore, or a good ſtones throw from my
dwelling-houſe, to which I can go at any time in a pair of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes,
and to the other Offices in leſſe then one; the corner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieces
that the grand Circle within the Square leaves, being
fartheſt off, yet are within leſs <hi>then twice</hi> twelveſcore, which
being (in generall, for upon particular cauſe you may at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
plough them for a time, and lay them down again) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted
to be paſture for your Milch-cowes, and all ſuch
ſtronger Cattel as you have not preſent uſe for, as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
they may be driven, as occaſion ſerves, with much caſe:
for this is highly worth conſideration in Husbandry (for the
thing is better known then conſidered) that a little difference
in diſtance (though it be but one Acres length, which is but
220 yards) occaſions a trouble or charge, not a little more
when ſowen with Corne, or let lie for Meadow, then when
grazed with ſtrong Cattel. For admit that piece to be ſquare,
then it contains 10 Acres, which may well yield at leaſt 20
wain-loads, or Cart-loads of corn, every of which is worth
ſix pence or foure pence at leaſt to carry an Acres length,
and ſo for every Acres length that ſhall be added;
whereas to drive an hundred Milch-cowes, a flock of
ſheep or the like, will require but a man or a boy, and his
dog. And of what advantage diſpatch is, (or may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49516:17"/>
happen to be eſpecially) is not eaſie to be valued. Now
as it is apparent to me; ſo I think it is or may be to all men,
that the Poſition is true, and that this Way meerly in the
Contrivance, without or beſides any other Improvement
ſhall make 100 Acres, to all intents and purpoſes as uſefull
and profitable, as 150 Acres can be (that being alſo without
any other Improvement then the meer common Forme of
caſting out and the uſes that Form is capable of) in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Forme. But that the common Forme is capable of
good improvement, I deny not, but I affirm this to be much
more; for this is apt for many Uſes which are altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
for, and not uſed, nor poſſibly to be uſed upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Forms of Farme, and to thoſe Uſes, to which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Farmes are, or may be put, theſe may be put alſo, but
with more eaſe, ſafety, profit and pleaſure abundantly. And
If my new Invention for Setting of Corn, and all its Parts,
were put in Execution (together with ſome other Inventions
or Contrivances for, in, or concerning other the parts of
Univerſal Husbandry, which God hath given into my hands
(and for which I praiſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

of good Land in this Forme, I fear it would be, or give
but too much of profit and delight for men to enjoy in this
life. I ſhall therefore, as to my own Intereſt, or action, in

ſelf to God, and to his righteous will and wiſe diſpenſation
how, how far, what friends or means he will raiſe for me, or

abſolutely impoſſible. As for the difference of that Salt from
Niter, that conſiſteth herein, that Niter is a Salt extreamly
ſpirituous and unctuous; of which two qualities the other
Salt ſtill ſubſiſting in its own groſſe, and as it were terreſtriall

                  <head>AN
Eſſay upon Mr. W. Potters Deſigne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
a Bank of Lands to be erected
throughout this Common-wealth.</head>
                  <p>THere is no man, but muſt live by the fruits, either
of his own labours or of what his friends have left
him. And becauſe no one perſon is fitted for all Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
nor any one Vocation fitted to produce all kinde of
neceſſaries for mans uſe, from hence there aroſe (from the
beginning) a neceſſity of ſome ſuch <hi>Medium</hi> of Commerce,
which we ordinarily call Money, to be currant, between ſuch
as have, either no reciprocal want, of each others commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
or no liking of each others conditions or price.</p>
                  <p>This Univerſal credit or <hi>Medium</hi> of Commerce, hath been
(through all former ages) placed in the metals of Gold and
Silver; other metals (by being made currant money, (by the
Authority of ſome States) beyond their intrinſick value)
having approved themſelves, to be very ſubject, either to the
inconvenience of being counterfeited, by diſhoneſt perſons,
or Neighbour Nations, or to be (by the injuſtice of the
Prince) ſometimes altered to a higher or lower value, a cheat
too ordinarily made uſe of, by the Kings of <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Inconveniencies that have bin found (by the latter ages)
in, theſe two metals of Gold Silver, are,
Firſt, that there hath not bin (at leaſt not yet) a ſufficient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of either of them, to ſupply all Nations towards that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49516:20"/>
of Trade, which a greater quantity of money (if it
could be had) would produce; It being an infallible Rule, that
money being that, which every man (his petty occaſions ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd)
ſeeks to employ in Land, Trade, at Intereſt, or ſome
ſuch other way, as may make him a yeerly return of gain)
the more there is of money in any Nation, the quicker alſo
muſt all thoſe wayes be, wherein money is ordinarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Inconvenience is, that all thoſe Countries, that
have inconſiderate Mines of Gold and Silver, or (perhaps)
none at all, muſt (for the obteining of a thing, ſo neceſſary to
the upholding of ordinary Commerce among themſelves
and with other Nations) part with ſo much of their beſt
Staple-Commodities, as will purchaſe the Gold and Silver
they want, from that great Merchant of Gold and Silver, the
King of <hi>Spain;</hi> whereas, (could there be ſome ſuch other
<hi>Medium</hi> of Commerce found out, as this Common-wealth
might (without paying or being liable, or beholding, to any
other Prince) raiſe, to, and within it ſelf) there would be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Millions worth of our Staple-Commodities (now) ſaved,
which muſt otherwiſe be parted with, to ſupply our preſent
want of money.</p>
                  <p>The third Inconvenience, which hath been found, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in Silver (the moſt common metall of the two) is; that
the keeping of it in a private Caſh is dangerous; the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
carrying of it from place to place, is both dangerous and
troubleſome; and the delivery and telling of it, from hand
to hand, is none of the leaſt buſineſſes in a Common-wealth,
eſpecially if verſed in Trade.</p>
                  <p>Towards the obviating of theſe laſt Inconveniencies, aroſe
that admirable Invention of a Bank; which (in ſhort) is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing, then a tranſmitting of the Ownerſhip of money,
(depoſited in a Publique Treaſury, and ſecured (there) by
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49516:20"/>
Publique Authority) from hand to hand, by aſſignation one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
without the danger and trouble of keeping, carrying, or
telling it.</p>
                  <p>This way of aſſignation of the Ownerſhip of money, or
credit in Bank, hath, (among Merchants) approved it ſelf, to
be of excellent uſe, for the diſpatch of all their buſineſſe of
payment.</p>
                  <p>But the Inconveniencies, which this kinde of payment, (by
way of aſſignation) hath not remedied, are</p>
                  <p>1 That it hath been (hitherto) applied, to the diſpatch
of buſineſſe of payments, among Merchants onely, and not
(ordinarily) to the concernments of the reſt of the people, of
the Nation, where the Bank is kept-</p>
                  <p>2 That it is a better way onely, of the uſe of Gold and
Silver, towards the diſpatch of the buſineſſe of Payment;
and not at all any new <hi>Medium</hi> of Commerce; money being
ſtill, that neceſſary requiſite to a Bank, without or beyond
which, a Bank can neither be raiſed nor extended; ſince the
having of more Credit, to be currant in a Bank, then there
is money to anſwer it, is no better then a publique Cheat; and
to be accounted, ſo much worſe, then in any private perſon,
in that Rulers have (by their Office) a more immediate Image
of God, and have been (in ſome places of Scripture) honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with that name, and ſhall not the Judge of all the earth
or of all Nations do right?</p>
                  <p>3 That money (depoſited (as above mentioned) in any
one place) proves, not onely a temptation to the ſword (as
lately in <hi>Holland</hi>) but (if once ſurpriz'd) becomes a certain
loſs to all the Owners, and an invincible opportunity, (in the
hand of the poſſeſſor) againſt the State or Common-wealth
in which ſuch Banks are kept.</p>
                  <p>Having thus hinted; firſt, the abſolute neceſſity (from the
beginning) of ſome <hi>Medium</hi> of Commerce; Secondly, the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49516:21"/>
Inconveniencies of thoſe metals (Gold and Silver) in which
this <hi>Medium</hi> of Commerce or Univerſall Credit, hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
been placed. And thirdly, the imperfection of Banks,
(thoug an excellent invention) becauſe they are but a lame
and ſhort remedy to thoſe Inconveniencies. That which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains,
is, (from a due conſideration, of every part of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes)
to hold forth (if it may be) ſome ſuch New <hi>Medium</hi> of
Commerce (in the place of Gold and Silver) as,</p>
                  <p>1 Shall be (at leaſt) of as true intrinſick value, as Gold and
Silver.</p>
                  <p>2 May be raiſed by this Common wealth, within it ſelf,
without any parting with our Staple-Commodities for it,
and without ſupplying the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ing of <hi>Spain,</hi> (who in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of wiſe men) is likelieſt to be our final and greateſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy.</p>
                  <p>3 May be extended, to ten times more, then ever this
Nation was owner of in money; to the incredible increaſe of
in-land Commerce, and (conſequently) of exportation and
forreign Trade.</p>
                  <p>4 May be managed, without any leaſt danger, either (of
loſs) to the Owners, or (of conqueſt) to the Common-wealth.</p>
                  <p>5 May be tranſmitted, between perſon and perſon, and
between place and place, with as much eaſe and ſecurity, as is
to be found in forreign Banks.</p>
                  <p>6 Will leave all the money (which either is yet remaining,
or ſhall hereafter (by a wiſe ordering of our Trade) increaſe
within this Nation) free for the Peoples uſe, without bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it, (as if the Rulers be juſt and true) is done in For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Banks.</p>
                  <p>7 If to the premiſſes there can be added; firſt, how the
private perſon may (readily without any trouble or charge)
obtein money, at three pound <hi>per Cent.</hi> Secondly, how ſuch
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49516:21"/>
a Revenue, may be raiſed to the Publique, as may (in a great
part, if not altogether) take away the neceſſity, of any future
Taxes whatſoever from the people, the Propoſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ions may
(perhaps) deſerve acceptance.</p>
                  <p>Now ſince the Propoſition to be made, towards ſo great
a ſcope, is no other, then a complication of ſeveral things,
already practiſed in the World, and ariſes chiefly from the
ground of reaſon, upon which Forreign Banks conſiſt; I
ſhall (therefore) by way of inlargement of what hath been
above hinted, concerning Forreign Banks, ſay;</p>
                  <p>1 That the manner of the Banks beyond the Sea, is that
one ſpecies of money (ſuch as Authority appoints) is brought
into a Bank, or Publique Treaſury.</p>
                  <p>2 That the money thus depoſited, is (inſtead of being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
out, carried and delivered) paſſed (from perſon to perſon)
by aſſignation onely of the Ownerſhip of ſo much money;
which (in the language of the place) is called credit in Bank
or Bank-credit.</p>
                  <p>3 That (becauſe all payments of Bils of Exchange muſt
(by a Law eſtabliſhed) be made at the Bank, it (from thence)
comes to paſs, that the Owners of the money in Bank
(though they may) do yet ſeldome or never take out their
money, but make their payments by aſſignation onely of their
credit in Bank, which goes (in a continual ſuit) from hand to
hand, with ſeldome or never taking the money out of the
Bank.</p>
                  <p>Towards the raiſing of thoſe Banks at the firſt, two Laws
were neceſſary from Authority, and eſtabliſhed (accordingly)
by them; firſt, that all payments of Bils (above twenty or
thirty pounds) ſhould be made at one place or Bank.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that all Payments to be made at that one place,
ſhould be made (alſo) in one ſpecies of Coine. After the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of publique Authorities, and of the Banks in For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:49516:22"/>
parts, it is (towards a far more valuable end) propoſed.</p>
                  <p>1 That there be (by Authority) a hundred ſeveral places
(or more if occaſion require) appointed in this Common-wealth,
where all payments whatſoever (above ten or twenty
pounds) ſhall be made and recorded, and this for avoiding of
difference in all ſuch payments.</p>
                  <p>2 That all payments (above ten or twenty pounds) be
enjoyned by authority, to be made in Bank-credit.</p>
                  <p>3 That there be no way, to raiſe this credit in Bank, but
by morgage of Land, for the ſecurity of thoſe who (from
time to time) ſhall be Owners of the Credit in Bank; And the
condition of the morgage to be, either to pay ſo much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
with intereſt at ſix pounds <hi>per Centum,</hi> within a twelve
moneth from the day, that Bank-credit ſhould (any way) fail
to be currant, or (in default of ſuch payment) the Land to
be forfeited without redemption, and to be divided, among
the Owners of the Credit in Bank.</p>
                  <p>From the premiſſes theſe conſequences will follow;</p>
                  <p>1 The making of all payments, at the ſeverall places a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-mentioned,
will raiſe ſo many Banks.</p>
                  <p>2 The injoyning of all payments above ten or twenty
pounds) to be made in Bank-Credit, will make money (in
payments above ten or twenty pounds) to be a ſeeker, to be
turned into Bank-Credit, being (it ſelf) not currant, in ten or
twenty pound payments, till ſo converted.</p>
                  <p>3 The raiſing of Bank-Credit, onely by or upon Land,
will avoid; all counterfeiting; (as in caſe of Copper-money)
all danger of ſurprize (as lately in <hi>Holland</hi>) there being (by
the Law of the Bank) no money to reſt there; all hazard to
them, that ſhall be (from time to time) Owners of all the
credit in the Bank, becauſe there is no credit in the Bank, but
what is ſufficiently ſecured in the ſame manners as money, that
is now borrowed upon Land.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:49516:22"/>
4 It will multiply Money, (or that which will ſupply the
place of Money) in the Land to two thirds, three fourths,
four fifths, (or (perhaps) more) of the value of the Lands
of the Nation, which can amount to little leſſe then a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
millions Sterling.</p>
                  <p>5 It will furniſh the Landed man with Bank-credit (cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
in payment) at two <hi>per Cent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6 By two <hi>per Cent.</hi> payable (yearly) to the publique, for
one thouſand, ſix hundred, ſixty ſix pounds, thirteen ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
and four pence of Banke-credit, upon every hundred
pound <hi>per Annum;</hi> the publique will receive (yearly) 33
pounds, 13 ſhillings, 4 pence out of every hundred pound,
<hi>per Annum,</hi> that is, one third of the Rents of all the Lands,
that are morgaged; which is almoſt or altogether double to
what is now raiſed upon Lands, and which (the whole reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
of Lands being rated but at ſix Millions <hi>per Annum</hi>)
comes to two Millions <hi>per Annum</hi> to the Publique, for the
defraying of all publique charges, without any neceſſiy of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Taxes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Memorandum,</hi> that all Lands, not morgaged to the
Bank, are left to pay the preſent taxes; and ſo there
will be no leaſt diſturbance to the preſent publique
Revenue.</p>
