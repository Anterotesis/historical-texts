            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>ALOMON</hi> ſayth, that there is a time for all things. The wiſdome of man therefore, is, to know his time, &amp; for all ſuch acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as hee vndertakes, to make choyce of the fitteſt, &amp; moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious time, to effect and bring them to paſſe. In worldly things which are moſt agreeable to our nature, we account the Morning the beſt &amp; moſt conuenient time
<pb facs="tcp:21099:5"/>
of all the day beſides: for reaſon &amp; experience do teach vs, that in the morning our memory is the quickeſt, our ſences the readieſt, our natural powers the ableſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reuiued, as it were, &amp; hauing recouered freſh ſtrength &amp; liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by reaſon of that ſweet ſleepe, and comfortable reſt, wherewith they were repoſed the night paſt. And therfore the Student for his ſtudy, the traueller for his iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, the labourer for his worke, and euery man in his place and calling, for ſuch proiects as hee hath, chuſeth the morning, as the fitteſt time, not onely to beginne, but alſo to further their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes.</p>
            <p>If therefore in things which are agreeable to nature, wee vſe the morning, as an helpe to further
<pb facs="tcp:21099:5"/>
vs in our actions, much more ſhould wee make choyce of the morning, for thoſe things which are leſſe agreeable to nature, or rather contrary to nature, yea in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, aboue nature, of which kind is praier, &amp; hearing of the word of God: for nature doth not ſtirre vs vp to prayer, neyther doth nature waken vs early in the morning to heare the word of God. Prayer, and hearing of the word, go with our nature, as againſt the ſtreame: and therefore it is very neceſſary, that the firſt thing that comes to our eyes in the morning, ſhould be the Temple, the firſt thing that comes to our eares, ſhould be the word of God, and the firſt thing that comes to our minde, ſhould be prayer and thankeſgiuing, that ſo we may walke with <hi>Eliah,</hi> al the
<pb facs="tcp:21099:6"/>
day after, in the ſtrength of thoſe things which wee haue heard out of the word of God: and ſo wee ſhall vſe our callings more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully &amp; conſcionably, we ſhall be directed what to doe, and what to leaue vndone, and whatſoeuer we doe, we ſhall do all things the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Gods glory, and the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of our owne ſoules continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in peace and patience.</p>
            <p>And truly, if wee conſider the practiſe of the Saints of God, wee ſhall find, that they haue obſerued the morning, as the fitteſt time for the exerciſes of their piety &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion.<note place="margin">

And as this hath bin the time, which the Saints of God haue chiefly choſen for the practiſe of their piety &amp; deuotion: ſo wee read in the Scriptures, that God hath powred his bleſsings vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men, more vſually at this time than at any other time of the day.

<pb facs="tcp:21099:7"/>
for water, in ſo much as the king of Iſrael cryed out for feare of the preſent danger, it pleaſed God in the morning, when the meate offering was offered, to ſend the three kings plenty of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, both for the army and for all their cattel.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 2.15.</note> The holy Ghoſt came downe on the Apoſtles in the morning: for it was the third houre, which was between 7. and 8. of the clocke: ſo that it may be truly gathered, that they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that houre exerciſed in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the word of God &amp; prayer.</p>
            <p>Vpon which grounds, you that are of the Pariſh of S. <hi>Antholins</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> &amp; you y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are the hearers of the morning Lectures there, are worthily to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended: the one, becauſe you haue founded a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture in that place, at the fitteſt

time of the day, which, as hath bin prooued, is the morning; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in appeares your godly wiſdome. The other, for repayring to heare the ſaid Lecture; wherin appeares your zeale and deuotion.</p>
            <p>Many Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregations haue done religiouſly in this kinde, but you ſurmount them all: for howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the word is to be preached in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon, (and no time or ſeaſon is vnfit for the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the ſame) yet they are to bee commended aboue the reſt, which make choyce of the fitteſt time for this purpoſe. There bee ſome, which dare deride and ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this morning exerciſe; but this ought not to derogate from the worthines &amp; excellency of it; for I neuer heard of any action, were it neuer ſo holy and vertuous, but
<pb facs="tcp:21099:8"/>
it alwayes had aduerſaries to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach it. And this is a ſure argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vnto me, that it is a ſeruice acceptable vnto God, aboue other of the ſame nature, becauſe it is more depraued &amp; ſlandered than any other: for the more diuine that any action is, the more enuy hath the deuil at it. Let none ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be diſcouraged, or take offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce at this Lecture, if they heare it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny way euil ſpoken of: but let this be my exhortation both to you that mayntayne it, &amp; to you that repayre to heare it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that you be not weary of well doing: for ſo is the will of God,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.15.</note> that by continuing in well doing, you may put to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence the ignorance and malice of fooliſh men.</p>

So that the torments of hel, and the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wherewith Sodom and Gomorrha were deſtroyed, are fire and brimſtone.

            <p>And ſurely, if euer we ſtood in néed of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts to admoniſh vs, of counſell to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warne vs, or of examples to terrify vs, we now ſtand in néede of them in this hard and flinty-hearted age of the world, wherein neyther precepts nor counſell, nor exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of other folkes harmes can any thing preuayle with vs to make vs beware: what things ſoeuer were written before,

            <p>The ſuddenneſſe of Sodoms deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on appeares, in that the Hiſtory reporteth, that it happened by the Sunne-riſe in the morning: ſo that their deſtruction came vpon them vnawares.

            <p>When Almighty God brought that vniuerſall floud vpon the old world, <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> was a Preacher vnto them of that age, and by preparing the Arke, he gaue them warning what was intended towards them.</p>
            <p>In like maner, when Iericho was layd leuell with the ground, the ruines of that City were in a maner made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt vnto the Inhabitants thereof, by the ſeuen dayes compaſſing of it about, and the ſound of the trumpets did, as it were, ſound foorth their deſtruction

            <p>And as for ſuch as periſh at ſea, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſayd to dye ſuddenly: for when a man ſets his foote into a ſhip, he well knows, that there is but halfe a foots breadth at the moſt betwéene him &amp; death; ſo that a mans entrance into a ſhip to goe to ſea, is, as it were, an entrance into ſome dangerous ſickenes: and commonly there is ſome ſtorme before a ſhipwracke, which is a good premonition of enſuing danger; &amp; when a man is vnder water, he is not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently depriued of life, but there is ſome
<pb facs="tcp:21099:15"/>
reluctation of Nature, in which time of reluctation, there may be many a déep ſigh ſent vnto God for mercy and forgiuenes; and as it is with thoſe that goe to ſea, ſo it is with thoſe that goe to fight: who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, that the chance of warre is vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine? &amp; therfore when a man goes into the field to fight, he ſhould make account that he lies him downe vpon his ſick-bed. The Drums and Trumpets are to him as ſo many bells, that ſound forth his dolefull knell: The Arrowes, the Pikes, the ſhot of all ſort, are meſſengers of death vnto him, ſo that he cannot be ſaid to die ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:<note place="margin">Who are ſayd to dye ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> but that man dyes ſuddenly, who being in perfect health, and frée from all immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent danger, is ſo depriued of life, that there is no reluctation of Nature to bée perceiued. And what are we to iudge of ſuch?

                  <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi> 1. Reaſons why In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.</note>The firſt reaſon why the infants and ſucking babes in Sodom were deſtroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed aſwell as thoſe of elder yéers was, becauſe they were the branches of ſuch curſed trées, &amp; children of ſuch vngodly parents: for howſoeuer it be true, that the Lord ſpeakes by the Prophet <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiel,</hi> that the child ſhall not beare the fathers ſin, it is true alſo that the Lord himſelfe ſpeaketh in the ſecond Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, <hi>He will viſit the ſinne of the fathers vpon the children</hi>: So that if a wicked and vngodly man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get a child, that child ſhal not beare the ſinne of the parents ſpiritually, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally, if it walke in good wayes, and betake it ſelfe to holy and vertuous courſes: but if the childe of vngodly parents liue neuer ſo carefully and conſcionably according to Gods will, yet the Lord will viſit the ſinnes of the parents vpon it corporally &amp; tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally, and if it walke in the wayes
<pb facs="tcp:21099:35"/>
of the parents, it ſhall beare the ſinnes of the parents eternally alſo. But ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that a childe of vngodly parents neuer come to commit ſinne actually, the Lord in his iuſtice may viſit the ſinnes of the parents vpon that childe both temporally and eternally, becauſe it is of the ſame nature that the pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts are: euen as the Huntſ-man finding a litter of ſome noyſome &amp; obnoxious beaſtes, killes them, though they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer did harme, becauſe their nature is to doe harme if they liue: euen ſo, God in his iuſtice may deſtroy the very infants and ſucking babes both temporally and eternally, though they neuer committed ſinne actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe their nature is corrupt and tainted by propagation from their parents. But you will ſay vnto mée, The like may bée ſayd of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of godly parents. No: For the godly haue a promiſe, that God will not onely bée their GOD, but the GOD of their ſéede alſo:
<pb facs="tcp:21099:36"/>
ſo that if the children of the godly dye while they hang vpon the breſt, or in the wombe, yet there is hope of mercy, by reaſon of the promiſe: but if the children of the wicked dye before they be of power to commit ſinne actually, there is no hope of mercy, but a fearful expectatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of iuſtice, becauſe there is no promiſe of mercy belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging vnto them.</p>
            <p>You ſée then the reaſon, why God deſtroied thoſe infants &amp; ſucking babes of Sodom, with this temporall iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of fire &amp; brimſtone, euen becauſe they were children of vngodly pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. And if he hath deſtroyed them eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he hath done no more then in his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice he might, becauſe he neuer made promiſe of mercy vnto them.</p>
            <p>The ſecond reaſon why God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed theſe children, was to increaſe the griefe and ſorrow of their parents: for commonly the miſeries of our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are more grieuous vnto vs, then our owne miſeries. <hi>Dauid</hi> tooke the death of his ſonne <hi>Abſalo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> ſo heauily,
<pb facs="tcp:21099:36"/>
that hée wiſht hée had dyed for him. And out of queſtion, when this people ſaw their children lie ſprawling in the fire, ſcorcht and burnt with the heate thereof, when they heard them ſcréeke and cry, and could not helpe them, it was as grieuous vnto them, as their owne miſerie; and therefore the Lord did it, euen to increaſe and inlarge their ſorrow.</p>
            <p>The third reaſon why the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed theſe children, was,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi> 3.</note> becauſe they ſhould not walke in the wicked &amp; abominable waies of their parents; for if they had liued, the nature which they drew from their parents, would haue drawne them to the ſinnes of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents: leſt therefore theſe children ſhould haue traced the ſinfull ſteps of their parents, the Lord takes them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in the ſame deſtruction with their parents.</p>

            <p>Laſt of all, concerning the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie of that deſtruction, which the LORD brought vpon this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey and people, it is ſaid,<note place="margin">All li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing creatures deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Sodoms ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw.</note> that <hi>Hee deſtroyed all that grew vpon the earth</hi>: or as <hi>Tremelius</hi> hath lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly tranſlated the ſame wordes thus, <hi>All that the earth brought forth, and nouriſhed, all cattell and beaſts of the field, all creeping things, and whatſoeuer was vpon the face of the earth, was deſtroyed in this ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw.</hi> And here we may iuſtly won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at the iudgements of God, which he extendeth not only vnto man, which hath iudgements &amp; will, nor vnto babes and ſucklings which are tainted with

Behold then, O ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full man, thine owne vngraciouſneſſe, thou doeſt not only procure vengeance to thy ſelfe by thy ſinne, but to euery thing elſe that doth ſerue thy ſinfull vſe.

them himſelfe, and by prouoking God with his ſinne, to plague, puniſh, and deſtroy them. And ſurely, but that the prouidence of God doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine theſe ſilly dumbe creatures, it is a maruell, that they doe not break their league with man, and ſhake off the yoke of obedience toward him: It is a maruell that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth doth not rent in ſunder vnder man, as he walkes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, ſéeing it is ſo plagued with bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſſe for the ſinne of man: It is a maruell, that our oxen and our horſes, with their hornes and hooues, doe not make warre againſt vs, ſéeing we are ſuch vnrighteous &amp; tyrannicall Lords ouer them, not content to haue their vſe and ſeruice, except wée plague them beſides into ſuch vndeſerued vengeance of GODS wrath by our ſinnes and tranſgreſſions. Let vs therefore forbeare and eſchew ſinne, and flye from it, as from a Serpent, ſéeing by it wée doe not onely draw downe Gods heauy iudgements vpon

for nothing doth ſeparate man from God, but ſinne; nothing doth prouoke God to puniſh, plague and deſtroy man, but ſin; nothing doth draw downe the iudgements of God vpon man, but ſinne; and ſinne it was, that moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the Lord to reuenge himſelfe thus ſeuerely vpon this land and people, as it appeares by the wordes of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God to <hi>Abraham,</hi>

            <p>Firſt, when wee make it our firſt worke in the morning, being no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner out of our beds, but our minde is vpon our meat; for which cauſe <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> denounceth a wo vnto that land,
<pb facs="tcp:21099:46"/>
whoſe Princes eat in the morning: for ſuch as eate in the morning, are fit for nothing all the day after. Secondly, wée offend in eating and drinking, when we are too curious and nice in our dyet, not contenting our ſelues with ordinary and common meates and drinkes, but longing after ſtrange and vnuſuall things, and thoſe muſt be moſt coſtly and curiouſly dreſt: this was the ſinne of the Iſraelites,<note place="margin">

            <p>The third ſinne in eating &amp; drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is, when we eate and drinke with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out meaſure, not reſpecting what will

            <p>Laſtly, we offend in eating &amp; drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, when wee gréedily deuoure the creatures like dogs, which haue it no ſooner in their mouthes, but it is down their throats.

was not heard of in the day of Sodoms iniquity; for their vncharitableneſſe onely extended it ſelfe to ſtrangers, as farre as can bee gathered by Hiſtorie.

there was ſomtimes an age of giuing, &amp; lending: but now our pride, our coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe, our ſelfe-loue, perſwade vs, that all is too litle for our ſelues; &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this modern age neither giues nor lends; It may be, when we dye, then we will and bequeath, but as long as we liue, we kéepe and hold faſt.

There was an age, when men would haue forborne much, and haue forgiuen much: but now we go to law for euery trifling treſpaſſe, and we take our debtors by the throat, and caſt them in priſon, till they pay the vttermoſt farthing. But it may be, the Sodomits were as vnmercyfull as

            <p>Neither was the name of Engroſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer heard of in the day of Sodoms iniquitie: Theſe are they,<note place="margin">Againſt Engroſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers. <hi>Amos</hi> 8.5.</note> which ſwallow vp the poore; for when they haue got a commoditie into their hands, they make the Ephah ſmall, and the ſhekell great, and falſifie the weights by deceit: then they buy the poore for ſiluer, and the néedy for ſhooes, &amp; ſell the refuze of the wheat,

and their commodities at their owne price.

            <p>The vnmercifull vſury of our age farre exceeds all that euer hath beene before vs:<note place="margin">Againſt vſury.</note> All ages before vs haue
<pb facs="tcp:21099:67"/>
condemned it for a ſinne, but we haue thoſe in this age, that dare vndertake to defend it to be no ſinne. Vſury hath alwayes drawne her name from by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: but now ſhee may well haue her name of deuouring; for vſury, as it is practiſed amongſt vs, doth not only bite, but deuoure. The Vſurer in time paſt was excommunicated, as a man not worthy of the ſociety and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Saints; hee was depriued of Chriſtian buriall, as though hee were not worthy to lye in the earth, but in hell; he was not permitted to make a will at his death, as though his goods were not his owne: but now they are accounted worthy of the beſt company, our Churches are profaned with their ſepulchres, and their wils and Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments haue as good approbation, as theirs, who haue gotten their goods moſt truely and vprightly. Thus we doe not onely defend the ſinne which our forefathers haue condemned, but wee approoue, reuerence, and iuſtifie

the ſinner, which GOD will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne: and therefore wee ſurmount all that haue beene before vs in our ſinnes.</p>
            <p>What ſhall I ſay to the workema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of our time?<note place="margin">Againſt the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merciful dealing of work maſters.</note> Neuer were there ſuch vnmercifull perſons heard of, as ſome of them bee: if I ſhould ſpeake what I could, it might ſéeme vncredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that euer there ſhould be ſuch vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifull courſes among Chriſtians. Theſe are they which grind the faces of the poore Tradeſman, by changing his wages ſeuen times, as <hi>Iacob</hi> ſaid to <hi>Laban</hi>: for eyther they deteyne the workmans wages, or they abate them, or they change them, or reckon them ſhort, or pay them in ſuch commodities as is to be wondred at. And ſurely, great pity it is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſome mercifull man or other doth not take in ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to redreſſe this oppreſſion of the workemaſters: but if the poore Tradeſman ſhould complaine, or ſéeke redreſſe, then hee ſhould loſe all, and cleane thruſt
<pb facs="tcp:21099:68"/>
himſelfe out of cuſtome for all worke. Thus muſt hee take all, and hold him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe content, or loſe all, and be content whether he will or not. Was there e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſuch a lamentable thing heard of, that the workeman liuing in his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, according to the law which God firſt layd vpon man, <hi>In the ſweat of thy browes ſhalt thou get thy liuing,</hi> ſhould notwithſtanding, contrary to that law, bee wronged of his wages which are the ſtay of his liuing? Oh ye vnmercifull men of the world, haue you none to oppreſſe but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poore work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man? haue you not read, <hi>Thou ſhalt not muzzell the mouth of the Oxe that treadeth out of the corne</hi>?

Thus are wee vnmercifull in giuing, vnmercifull in forgiuing, vnmercifull in lending, vnmercifull in paying, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifull in buying and ſelling: ſo that it may iuſtly be ſaid of vs, which was ſaid of the Sodomites, They ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then not the hand of the poore &amp; néedy.</p>
            <p>Thus haue we found, by comparing our ſinnes with the ſinnes of Sodom, that wee are nothing behind them in our ſinnes; if we excéed them not, wee are ſurely equall with them. It is ſaid of the ſinnes of Sodom, that they cryed in the eares of the Lord: and ſurely our ſinnes are as ſaucy and impudent, as euer were theirs; and if theirs cryed,<note place="margin">Sinnes of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, crying ſinnes.</note> ours are not tongue-tide, I warrant you: we reach home to them with our wickedneſſe. The ſinnes of Sodom were growne to their full height, &amp; ſo are ours. For it is impoſſible, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man or woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in theſe dayes, ſhould adde any thing to the ſins which they practiſe: ſo that as in a general plague, it is not ſuch a maruell at thoſe which

            <p>When the LORD had taken knowledge of the cry of the ſinnes of Sodom, and had found their ſins to be according to the cry, euen the next day he rained fire and brimſtone from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and deſtroyed them all. So, when the Lord ſhal finde our ſinnes at their full height, he will ſpéedily bring his iudgements vpon vs, and deſtroy vs: for as the huſbandman thruſts the ſickle into the Corne, when it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitly ripe; and as the Oxe is brought to the ſlaughter, when hee is fat: ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction comes vpon men, when the meaſure of ſinne is fulfilled.</p>
