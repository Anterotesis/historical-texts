            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the former. part of this <hi>Chapter</hi>
we have the famous <hi>dialogue</hi> that
passed betwixt the Lord Jesus, and
the Woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
whereof was this. Our bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<hi>Saviour</hi> did with unwearied care and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry
lay out himself for the gaining and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52743:3"/>
winning of souls, and the bringing of them to
the obedience of his Father. He sought not so
much how to make himself <hi>great,</hi> as how to
make others <hi>good.</hi> He made it his business to
rescue the poor sapsed and degenerated sons of
men out of the paws of <hi>Satan,</hi> whom he saw
hurrying them away towards destruction: and
reduce them into a state of peace and safety.
And though he met with great opposition herein
(the <hi>dragon</hi> and his <hi>angels,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 12. 7.</note> with united force,
and inflamed rage banding against him) yet, as
was foretold,<note place="margin">Isa. 53. 10, 11.</note> 
               <hi>the pleasure of the Lord</hi> did <hi>prosper
in his hand; and he saw of the travel of his
soul;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 4. 25.</note> the people following him in great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
from <hi>Galilee,</hi> and from <hi>Decapolis,</hi> and
from <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and from <hi>Judaea,</hi> and from
beyond <hi>Jordan,</hi> admiring his wisdom, and speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
well of his name. Which the envious <hi>Pharisees</hi>
(that <hi>viperous</hi> brood,<note place="margin">Mat. 3. 7.</note> impatient of whatever
tended to the Eclipsing of their own autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and esteem) taking notice of, laid their
heads together against him: and without having
any respect to the divine <hi>Majesty</hi> that shone in
his countenance, the <hi>innocency</hi> of his person, <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness</hi>
of his life, or <hi>eminency</hi> of his works, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted
how they might destroy him. Such was
their prodigious unthankfulness, and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness,
that the more love he manifested to
them, the more hatred they shewed to him.
The more he appeared <hi>for</hi> them, the more they
appeared <hi>against</hi> him. The more he laboured
to <hi>save</hi> them, the more they laboured to <hi>slay</hi>
him; thereby giving him occasion to complain
of them, as <hi>David</hi> once did of his enemies,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52743:3"/>
               <hi>they rewarded me evil for good.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 35. 12.</note> And he being
aware of their bloody design, departs from
amongst them; and being on his way, he comes
to <hi>Sychar</hi> a City of <hi>Samaria</hi> (it is the same
with that <hi>Shechem,</hi> and <hi>Sichem</hi> so often menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
in the Old Testament, where <hi>Joshuah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Josh. 24. 1.</note> and
<hi>Eleazar</hi> the <hi>High-Priest</hi> held the first <hi>Council</hi>
for the abolishing of strange <hi>Worship</hi>) and so he
leaves the proud, self-admiring <hi>Pharisees</hi> that
dealt so unworthily with him, and goes and
òpens the treasures of grace and love to the
despised <hi>Samaritans:</hi> thereby verifying that
sacred <hi>Oracle,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 11. 25</note> 
               <hi>thou hast hid these things from
the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them
unto babes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now at this <hi>Sychar,</hi> to which our <hi>Saviour</hi>
came, there was a <hi>Well</hi> called <hi>Jacobs</hi> Well. For,
we read in the history of the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> that
when <hi>Jacob came to Shalem a City of Shechem,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 33. 18.</note> 
               <hi>he
bought a parcel of Land, of the Children of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor
and there erected an Altar:</hi> and then (in
all probability) made this <hi>well,</hi> which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
till our <hi>Saviours</hi> time, being called by the
name of <hi>Jacobs</hi> Well.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Consenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neum vero cum eo loci habitarit etiam plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res pute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>os fodisse, In loc.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Contzen</hi> the <hi>Jesuite</hi>
thinks that when <hi>Jacob</hi> was at this place, he did
not only make <hi>this,</hi> but many <hi>Wells.</hi> Whether
this be true or no, doth not appear, but this is
evident, that if when he was at this place, he
made many <hi>Wells,</hi> either this only of them all
remained till our <hi>Saviours</hi> time, or else was in
a way of peculiar eminency, called <hi>Jacobs</hi> Well.</p>
            <p>It was about the <hi>sixth hour,</hi> that is, about
Noon, when our <hi>Saviour</hi> came to this Well.
He was weary with his tedious Journey, which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52743:4"/>
had lasted him, as may be computed, two or
three dayes, and here he sits down to rest him
and refresh him. And the <hi>Disciples</hi> being gone
into the City for provision, he continues there
alone. Presently there comes a Woman of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria</hi>
to draw Water: and he being willing to
make use of all occasions of doing good, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
into discourse with her; which continued
so long, till she perceived there was more
than ordinary worth in him; till she saw he
was a <hi>Prophet.</hi> And having such an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
she presently starts that great <hi>question</hi> so
much controverted betwixt the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans</hi>
about the <hi>place</hi> of Worship. Whether
she did it out of Womanish <hi>loquacity,</hi> or to pass
away the <hi>time,</hi> or to satisfie <hi>conscience,</hi> appears
not, but this is evident, that she did it.</p>
            <p>Now the Question it self was this; <hi>Whether
Garizim where the Samaritans Sacrificed, or
Jerusalem where the Jews Sacrificed, were the
true place of Worship?</hi> On the one hand,<note place="margin">Joseph An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiq. Judaic. l. 11. c. 8. Graecol. p. 382.</note> the
<hi>Samaritans</hi> held, that <hi>Garizim</hi> was it; on the
other hand, the <hi>Jews</hi> held, that <hi>Jerusalem</hi> was
it. The occasion of this difference (as divers
authors shew) happened thus. The <hi>Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi>
were the off-spring of those Nations,<note place="margin">Epiphan. t. t. l. 1. hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res. 14. p. 30. Ed. Paris.</note>
whom <hi>Salmanazar</hi> King of <hi>Assyria,</hi> placed in
the Cities of <hi>Samaria,</hi> after he had carryed the
ten <hi>Tribes</hi> captive; and at their coming thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
being <hi>Pagans,</hi> they worshipped not the
God of <hi>Israel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cunaeus <hi>de Rep. Hebr.</hi> l. 2. <hi>c.</hi> 16. <hi>p. (mihi)</hi> 208. 2 Kings 17. 25.</note> but the gods of the <hi>Nations</hi> from
whence they came. Hereupon, the <hi>Lord</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
with their Idolatry, sends <hi>Lyons</hi> amongst
them, which molested and slew them. And
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52743:4"/>
they apprehending it to be, because they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped
not the God of the land, they sent to
the King of <hi>Assyria,</hi> and informed him how
things stood. Upon that, he sends them one
of the captive <hi>Priests,</hi> who came and taught
them how they should fear the <hi>Lord;</hi> and so,
to make sure work, they worshipped both the
God of <hi>Israel,</hi> and their <hi>own</hi> God too. And
thus it continued t<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll towards the end of the
<hi>Persian</hi> Monarchy; at which time <hi>Manasses</hi> bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to <hi>Jaddus</hi> the <hi>High priest</hi> of those <hi>Jews</hi>
that were returned from <hi>Babylon,</hi> did contrary
to the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moses,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 7. 3.</note> which forbad contracting
of Matrimony with the forreign Nations, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>Nicazo</hi> daughter to <hi>Sanballat</hi> the <hi>Horonite,</hi>
then governour of <hi>Samaria;</hi> for which fact
<hi>Jaddus</hi> his brother and the other <hi>Jews,</hi> were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
incensed against him, and expelled
him from <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> Upon this, he betakes
himself to <hi>Sanballat</hi> his Father-in-law, <hi>who</hi>
courteously entertains him; and not only so,
but upon <hi>Alexander's</hi> the Great; overcoming
the <hi>Persians,</hi> he obtains leave of him to build a
Temple at <hi>Garizim,</hi> and there he places this <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasses</hi>
his Son-in-law, to perform the Office of
<hi>High-priest.</hi> Now this was very injurious to
the <hi>Jews</hi> and begat great confusion. For, if any
had eaten unlawful <hi>meats,</hi> trangressed the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi>
marryed strang <hi>Wives,</hi> or the like, and
were censured and ejected as <hi>unclean</hi> by the
<hi>Jews,</hi> they could presently run to <hi>Samaria,</hi> and
there be received. And this produced a woful,
and irreconcileable <hi>schism</hi> betwixt those two
people, insomuch that they lived in perpetual
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52743:5"/>
discord. The hatred betwixt them was so great,
that they held it unlawful to <hi>eat</hi> or <hi>drink</hi> with
one another.<note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> de Iure Nat. l. 2 c. 5. p. 177. Ed. Nov. Joh. 4. 9.</note> Hence that saying of this Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to our <hi>Saviour, How is it that thou being
a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a Woman
of Samaria?</hi> Nay such was the hatred of the
<hi>Jews</hi> to the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> that though they
granted leave to all Nations in the World, to
become <hi>Proselytes</hi> to their religion, yet would
they not grant it to them. Witness that solemn
form of <hi>excommunication,</hi> termed <hi>excommunicatio

against them by <hi>Ezra,</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah. They as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled
the whole Congregation</hi> (saith my Author)
<hi>into the Temple of the Lord, and brought 300 Priests,</hi>

               <hi>300 Trumpets, and 300 books of the Law, with as
many boyes. And when they sounded their Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets,

by all the sorts of excommunication, in
the mystery of the name Jehovah, and in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue,
and with the curse both of the inferiour
and superiour house of judgement, that no Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite
should eat the bread of a Samaritan (whence
they say, he who eateth bread of a Samaritan, is
as he who eateth Swines flesh) and let no Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan
be a proselyte in Israel, neither let them
have any part in the resurrection of the
dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as the <hi>Jews</hi> did thus prosecute their cause
against the <hi>Samaritans</hi> with much heat and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,
so likewise did the <hi>Samaritans</hi> theirs,
against them. Though they had the worse of
it, yet were they no less peremptory, and sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast
in their way than the former, being ready
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52743:5"/>
upon all occasions to maintain their opinion
and dispute for it. Witness the carriage of the
Woman in this place: she do's not barely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
the <hi>question</hi> to our <hi>Saviour,</hi> and then
wait to hear how he would determine it, but
stands up and reasons with him about it. <hi>Our
Fathers</hi> (saith she) <hi>worshipped in this Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
and ye say that in Jerusalem is the place
where men ought to Worship.</hi> Now our <hi>Saviour</hi>
in answer to this great <hi>question,</hi> and for the
composing of this long difference of no less
than 400 years continuance, tells her, that the
time was approaching wherein the Worship of
God should be confined neither to <hi>Garizim</hi> nor
<hi>Jerusalem;</hi> yet by the way lets her know, there
was a great deal of difference betwixt the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of the <hi>Samaritans</hi> and the <hi>Jews: Ye Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi>
(saith he) <hi>ye know not what, we know
what we Worship.</hi> There was no comparison
betwixt the Worship of the <hi>Samaritans</hi> and the
<hi>Jews.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> might miss it in the <hi>manner</hi>
of their Worship, but the <hi>Samaritans</hi> did not
only miss it in that, but likewise in the <hi>object</hi>
of it, for they worshipped they <hi>knew not what.</hi>
But in opposition both to the Worship of the
<hi>Samaritans</hi> and the <hi>Jews,</hi> he tells her, that <hi>the
hour cometh and now is, when the true Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
shall Worship the Father in spirit and in
truth, &amp;c.</hi> Which words imply as much as if
he had said; the <hi>question</hi> which thou now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundest
to me, and hath been disputed so
long, with so much heat amongst you, is now
of small moment; for God is about not only
to alter the <hi>place</hi> but the <hi>manner</hi> of his Worship.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:52743:6"/>
As he will not have his Worship limited either
to <hi>Garizim</hi> or <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> so neither will he have
it limited to the <hi>mode</hi> either of the one place or
the other, but will be worshipped after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>manner:</hi> and the manner wherein he will be
Worshipped is <hi>spiritual</hi> and <hi>simple; they that
Worship him, must Worship him in spirit and in
truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus I have, with what brevity I could
conveniently, led you down to the words of
the Text, and given you an account of the <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,</hi>
and <hi>occasion</hi> of them. To make any <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lysis</hi>
or division of them is needless, and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
without any further stay, I shall draw
from them this point;<note place="margin">Doct.</note> 
               <hi>That it is the duty of the
sons of men in these dayes of the Gospel to Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
God in spirit and in truth.</hi> Though all
<hi>Christians,</hi> nay all <hi>Nations</hi> agree that there
is a God, and that he is to be Worshipped, yet
they do not agree about the manner of it.
Some will have him to be Worshipped one way,
and some another, according as their <hi>light</hi> and
<hi>principles</hi> lead them. Some will have him to
be Worshipped <hi>immediately,</hi> others <hi>mediately</hi> or
remotely. Some, with slaying of <hi>beasts,</hi> and
bloody <hi>sacrifices;</hi> others, in a <hi>spiritual</hi> and
<hi>simple</hi> manner, without any such adoe. Some,
in the use of external <hi>rites</hi> and <hi>shadows;</hi> others
without them. Now our <hi>Saviour,</hi> who came
from his Fathers bosome, and most perfectly
understood his will, undertakes the determining
of this controversie, and shews after what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
he would have men to Worship him,
<hi>They that Worship</hi> (saith he) <hi>must Worship him
in spirit and in truth.</hi>

The point lyes so visibly in the Text, that I
need not send you to other places of Scripture,
to shew you the truth of it, and therefore, I
shall not spend time in that. The Method I
shall observe in prosecuting it, is this. 1. I
shall shew what is meant by <hi>Worship.</hi> 2. What,
by <hi>spirit.</hi> 3. What, by <hi>truth.</hi> 4. The <hi>reasons</hi>
of both branches, that is to say, wherefore, we
must <hi>worship</hi> God in <hi>spirit,</hi> and wherefore, in
<hi>truth.</hi> 5. I shall lay down one or two <hi>cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
And 6. come to the <hi>Vses;</hi> all which I
shall dispatch with plainness and brevity.</p>

the extraction, and derivation whereof
the <hi>Etymologists</hi> are not agreed. <hi>Zanchy</hi> thinks
it's derived of <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, which signifies a <hi>Dog,</hi> and
that it is a Metaphor taken from <hi>spaniels,</hi> that
use in subjection to their masters, to couch upon
the ground before them. And that which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
it somewhat more probable, is, that the
Hebrew Words <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">

<hi>worship,</hi> do also signifie to fall down, or lye
prostrate; as also that the Jews both in their
<hi>civil</hi> and <hi>religious</hi> worship used to do so.
However, others are against this derivation, and
assign another. <hi>Rivet</hi> thinks it is derived of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
which signifies to <hi>kiss;</hi> and that which renders
this more probable, is that <hi>kissing</hi> hath been a
very antient <hi>symbol</hi> of adoration. Witness that
of Job, <hi>If my mouth</hi> (saith he) <hi>hath kissed
my hand, this were an iniquity to be punished by
the judge, for I should have denyed the God that
is above.</hi> A bare <hi>kissing</hi> the hand he cannot
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52743:7"/>
mean, for that we may reckon amongst those
actions that are indifferent, neither good nor
bad; but he means such a <hi>kissing</hi> of the hand,
as was a ceremony belonging to <hi>idolatrous</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.<note place="margin">

               </note>
The Heathenish Nations (as <hi>Estius</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves)
Worshipped the Sun and Moon; and
when they saw either of them clearly shining
forth, they stretched out their hands towards
them, and then laid them upon their mouths
and <hi>kissed</hi> them: thereby signifying that if they
could have got to them, they would have kis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
them, as they did their hands. Their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
was, that if they could have access to their
<hi>idols,</hi> they <hi>kissed</hi> them; if not, they <hi>kissed</hi> their
hands in token of worshipful reverence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them. So that <hi>Job,</hi> by these words in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates
thus much: that, if he had done as his
Heathenish Neighbours did; if he had relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished
the true <hi>God,</hi> and plaid the <hi>Idolater,</hi>
as they did, then he had deserved punishment
indeed. And in other places of Scripture we
find Worshipping set forth by the same phrase.
God tells the Prophet <hi>Elijah,</hi> who thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
alone,<note place="margin">1 Kings 19. 18.</note> the only true worshipper, that he
had <hi>seven thousand that had not bowed unto, nor
kissed Baal.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hos. 13 2.</note> And the Prophet <hi>Hosea,</hi> complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the wickedness of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> amongst
other things that he charges them with, this is
one, that they said <hi>Let the men that sacrifice
kiss the Calves.</hi> Whereby it appears, that this
heathenish Ceremony did not keep it self
among the barbarous Nations, where it was
hatched, but crept amongst the <hi>Israelites</hi> with
whom it sound too much entertainment. And
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52743:7"/>
the same <hi>Rivet,</hi> thinks <hi>David</hi> alludes to this

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, is more than I dare affirm. In the
derivations of words, though sometimes the
descent be obvious, and afford light, yet many
times it is very obscure and uncertain; and in
such cases we must be cautious, what stress we
lay on them. Whether this <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, I leave to every one to
judge: there be learned men on both sides.</p>
            <p>Let us now from the Name, pass to the thing
denoted by it. The <hi>worship</hi> set forth by this
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, is twofold: it is either <hi>civil</hi> or <hi>reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious.</hi>
Civil worship is reverent behaviour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
men, whereby we testifie our respect to
them, proportionably to the eminency we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
in them. Though I call it <hi>civil,</hi> yet I do not
so speak,<note place="margin">

               </note> as if I thought it not at all <hi>religious,</hi>
(for (as a judicious author well observes) <hi>it is</hi>
commanded by God who is the author of <hi>religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and it hath some <hi>analogy</hi> with the worship
which is more properly <hi>religious</hi>) but for that
the object (from which acts do usually receive
their names) is <hi>civil.</hi> But to go on; the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
testified by this kind of worship, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
expressed in the <hi>incurvation</hi> or bowing of
the body. So <hi>Abraham,</hi> upon his meeting the
three <hi>Angels, bowed himself towards the ground.</hi>
And upon his treating with the children of
<hi>Heth,</hi> about a burial place for his wife he <hi>bows
himself to them.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 18. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 23. 7.</note> The word used in both places
by the <hi>Septuagint</hi> is the same with this in the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52743:8"/>
Text. What we use to say of <hi>grace</hi> in reference
to <hi>Nature,</hi> that it do's not <hi>destroy</hi> but <hi>rectifie</hi> it,
the like we may say of it in reference to <hi>civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity:</hi>
it do's not <hi>destroy</hi> it in men, but <hi>rectifie</hi> and
<hi>regulate</hi> it; teaching them to <hi>whom</hi> to shew it,
in what <hi>manner,</hi> and in what <hi>degree.</hi> It is so
far from being an enemy to <hi>civility,</hi> that it
greatly promotes it; it subdues the <hi>Nabalism</hi>
and churlishness of mens natures, takes away
the gall and bitterness of them, and makes
them kind and pleasing. Turn over the histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of all Nations and ages, and you shall not
meet with any persons, of more condiscending,
obliging, sweet deportment, than such as have
been most eminent for <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>holiness.</hi> Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<hi>Abraham</hi> in this place; he was a great
Lord, and a mighty Prince, and yet how sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missively
and courteously doth he carry him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to these children of <hi>Heth,</hi> who were his
inferiours in many respects? This being so, what
shall we think of a generation of men amongst
us, that having renounced, and as it were, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested
against the common tokens of <hi>civility,</hi>
carry themselves before Magistrates and others
to whom they owe obeysance, like a company
of <hi>barbarians</hi> that never knew what civility
meant, making a conscience of putting off the
hat, calling a man master, and the like? But no
marvel; for if it be <hi>religion</hi> that teaches men
manners, as certainly it is, we may not wonder
that having laid aside religion, they have also
laid aside their manners. This is <hi>civil</hi> worship;
but it is not this kind of worship the Text speaks
of, and therefore I shall say no more of that.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:52743:8"/>
               <hi>Religious</hi> worship is devout behaviour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God, whereby we acknowledge his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty
over us, and the dueness of our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to him, appearing before him, and wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon him, in the way he hath appointed in
his Word. This <hi>David</hi> speaks of when he saith,
<hi>O come let us worship and bow down, let us kneel

And this our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi>

Now this worship belongs not to either An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels

or reverence, which God hath reserved as
a prerogative peculiar to himself. Agreeable

<hi>Religious</hi> worship is of a far other nature than
civil is; it differs from it, not only <hi>gradually,</hi>
as the reverence we give to the King differs
from that we give to one of his judges, or
Ministers of state, but <hi>specifically</hi> or in kind.
As all acts are to be suited <hi>to,</hi> so they are to be

appellations and titles agreeable to them. Now
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52743:9"/>

And the worship we give them must
be answerable. When we worship the <hi>creature,</hi>
we must do it, with apprehensions and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

the <hi>Creator,</hi> we must do it with apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
and affections becoming the Creator.
When we appear before <hi>men</hi> and do reverence
to them, we must do it with apprehensions of
eminency, but such as is <hi>created, imperfect,</hi> and
<hi>finite;</hi> but when we appear before <hi>God,</hi> and do
reverence to him, we must do it with apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of eminency, and that, such as is <hi>uncreated,
perfect,</hi> &amp; <hi>infinite.</hi> There are two dangerous rocks,
we are apt to dash our selves upon; the one is,
the ascribing to the <hi>creature</hi> the perfections of
God, by conceiving of him &amp; carrying our selves
towards him as <hi>God;</hi> and the other is, the ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing

him as a <hi>creature.</hi> Now to give to the <hi>creature</hi> the
Prerogative of <hi>God,</hi> and to charge upon <hi>God</hi> the
defects of the <hi>creature,</hi> are equally absurd and
dangerous. It must therefore be our care that
our worship be suitable to the object to which
it is tendered. That is fit for the <hi>Creator</hi> that
is not fit for the <hi>creature;</hi> and that is fit for
the <hi>creature,</hi> that is not fit for the <hi>Creator.</hi> In
our worshipping the <hi>creature</hi> we must take heed
of going <hi>too far;</hi> and in our worshipping the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52743:9"/>
Creator, we must take heed of falling <hi>short.</hi>
As <hi>God</hi> would not have us give to him the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
he hath allowed the <hi>creature,</hi> so neither will
he have us to give the <hi>creature</hi> that honour he
hath reserved for himself; but we must <hi>give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Caesar, the things that are Caesars,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 22. 21.</note>

the things that are Gods.</hi> If we neglect to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship

of the <hi>second</hi> table; if <hi>God,</hi> then we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
violence to the commandments of the <hi>first.</hi>
To worship God and not man is to overthrow
that beautiful and comely order he hath esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
in the world; and to worship <hi>man</hi> and
not <hi>God</hi> is to deny him that natural right that
belongs to him, and prefer his own <hi>creature</hi>
before him, which must needs be a sin of a very
hainous nature. We must see therefore, that we
worship both <hi>man</hi> and <hi>God:</hi> man with the
worshhip belonging to <hi>him,</hi> and God with
the worship belonging to <hi>him;</hi> which what
it is more particularly, is the next thing I
am to speak of.</p>
            <p>2. I am to shew what is meant by <hi>worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
God in <hi>spirit.</hi> For the better understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whereof, let us <hi>first</hi> enquire what is meant
by the <hi>simple</hi> term, <hi>spirit.</hi> For, if it be a
true rule, that the way to finde out the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a <hi>complex</hi> term is <hi>first</hi> to take it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunder,
and seek out the meaning of the <hi>simple</hi>
terms included in it, then the way to find out
the meaning of the <hi>worshipping</hi> God in <hi>spirit,</hi> is
first to take the clause asunder, and seek out the
meaning of the <hi>simple</hi> term, <hi>spirit.</hi> We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tell what is meant by worshiping God in <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:52743:10"/>
till we have <hi>first</hi> found out what is meant
by <hi>spirit,</hi> and when we know that, we may
easily know the other. Now the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
or <hi>spirit</hi> is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a word of various
significations, too many here to be reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up. It is a word that the holy Ghost hath
made use of to express the highest and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nentest
<hi>beings</hi> in the world. There is not any
intelligent <hi>being</hi> whatsoever, but it is applyed
to it.<note place="margin">John 4. 24.</note> Sometimes its spoken of God, consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
both <hi>essentially</hi> and <hi>personally.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 11.</note> Sometimes of
<hi>angels</hi> both <hi>good</hi> and <hi>bad.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 1. 14.</note> Sometimes of the <hi>soul</hi>
of man,<note place="margin">1 Kings 22. 21.</note> and that not only <hi>vital</hi> but <hi>rational,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 8. 55.</note> as
it comprehends the understanding,<note place="margin">Eccl. 12 7.</note> conscience,
heart, will, affections, and all the powers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
And in this last sense, that is, as it is put
for the reasonable soul, it uses to be taken when
it is mentioned with the service and duty that we
owe to God. Though the sacred Pen-men put it
for several things, yet when they joyn it with
our duty to God, they mean by it the <hi>reasonable
soul,</hi> which as it is the interiour, so it is the superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
nobler, and better part of man, whereby
only he is capable of knowing <hi>God,</hi> understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his <hi>will,</hi> and doing him service. Witness these
passages; <hi>God is my witness whom I serve with
my spirit.</hi> And,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 9.</note> 
               <hi>I will pray with the spirit.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 15.</note> And,<note place="margin">Eph. 6. 18.</note>
               <hi>praying alwayes, with all prayer, and supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the spirit.</hi> And so our <hi>Saviour</hi> uses the word
in this place, by <hi>spirit</hi> he means the reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>soul,</hi> or <hi>inner</hi> man, as it stands in oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the <hi>body</hi> or <hi>outward</hi> man. The meaning
then, of worshiping God in <hi>spirit</hi> is this; that
we must not worship him only with the <hi>body,</hi> or
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52743:10"/>
               <hi>outward</hi> man, as heathens and hypocrites use to
do, but with the <hi>soul</hi> or <hi>inner</hi> man, which is that
which he in all holy addresses mainly looks after.
This I might have been larger on, but I shall have
occasion to say somewhat of it under the next
particular.</p>
            <p>3. I am to shew you the meaning of worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God in <hi>truth.</hi> And of this passage I may say
as <hi>Maldonate</hi> did of another;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Nescio an facilior fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isset locus si nemo eum exposuisset in</hi> Luc. 11. 11.</note> 
               <hi>perhaps it had been
easier, had not men obscured it by their expositions.</hi>
Having perused several writers upon it, I find
them very different in their apprehensions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
it. Such of their opinions as are most
remarkable, I shall give you an account of, and
then recommend to you that which I take to
be the true and genuine sense of it.</p>
            <p>1. Some think that by <hi>spirit</hi> in this place, we
are to understand the <hi>third</hi> person in the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>
and by truth the <hi>second;</hi> and that to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
God in <hi>spirit,</hi> and in <hi>truth,</hi> is to worship
the <hi>Father</hi> in the <hi>Son,</hi> and the <hi>Son</hi> in the <hi>Holy
Ghost,</hi> which is to worship the whole <hi>Trinity.</hi>
This way goes <hi>Athanasius;</hi> but as <hi>Tolet</hi> the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit</hi>
saith truly,<note place="margin">Epist. ad Serapion.</note> 
               <hi>it is difficult to accommodate this
to the context.</hi> Had this been our <hi>Saviours</hi> mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
he should rather have said,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Difficile est haec accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modare hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ic contex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tui.</hi> in Loc.</note> they that
worship him, must worship him in <hi>truth</hi> and in
<hi>spirit,</hi> than as it is here in <hi>spirit</hi> and in <hi>truth.</hi>
But the mistake is evident, and therefore I need
to say no more of it.</p>
            <p>2. Others think, to worship God in <hi>spirit</hi> and
in <hi>truth</hi> are one and the same thing; that to
worship him in <hi>spirit,</hi> is to worship him in <hi>truth;</hi>
and to worship him in <hi>truth,</hi> is to worship in
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52743:11"/>
               <hi>spirit;</hi> and so they will have the one to be an
exposition of the other. And they say to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
him in <hi>spirit,</hi> and in <hi>truth,</hi> is not to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
him under a <hi>visible</hi> representation or simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude,
as if he were a material substance or body.
For, the <hi>Samaritans</hi> worshipped him under the
image of a <hi>dove,</hi> and circumcised their children
in the name thereof. And so they will have our
<hi>Saviours</hi> words to imply as much as if he had an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
the woman thus. Thou enquirest of me
concerning the true place of worship, whether
it be mount <hi>Garizim</hi> or <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> which is a
thing now not very material, for as much as
the time is at hand, that the worship of God
shall be confin'd to neither of them. But there
is a greater difference betwixt us then that of
place, which thou takest no notice of, and that
is about the object of worship; <hi>ye worship ye
know not what, we know what we worship.</hi> q. d.
ye worship the true God as we do, but ye wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
him under a <hi>visible</hi> similitude, whereby it
appears ye know him not; <hi>but the hour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
and now is, that the true worshippers shall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
the Father in spirit and in truth,</hi> &amp;c. That is,
they shall not worship him under any <hi>visible</hi>
shape as you do, but shall conceive of him as
he is, namely a <hi>spirit.</hi> This was the opinion of
our learned country man Mr. <hi>Mede.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Diatrib. in loc.</note> But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the respect I bear to the author,
and his excellent works, I conceive this is none
of our <hi>Saviours</hi> meaning. For 1. how will it
be proved that the <hi>Samaritans</hi> worshipped God
under the similitude of a dove? <hi>L'empereur</hi> a
great master in critical learning,<note place="margin">Not. <hi>ad</hi> Benjam. Judelen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sem. p. 170.</note> denies it. And
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52743:11"/>
               <hi>Cunaeus</hi> doth not only acquit them from this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
idolatry of the Dove,<note place="margin">De Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pub.</note> but from all Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry
whatsoever.<note place="margin">Heb. l. 2. <hi>c. 16. p.</hi> 273.</note> He grants that they did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
live in idolatry, but withal saith that they
wholly renounced it, and that before the time
of <hi>Sanballat,</hi> following the religion prescribed by
<hi>Moses. 2.</hi> Grant they did worship God as is alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
under the shape of a Dove, yet the <hi>antithesis</hi>
or opposition in the words will not admit this to
be the sense of them. For, our <hi>Saviour</hi> doth not set
the worshipping of God in <hi>spirit</hi> and in <hi>truth</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in opposition to the worship of the <hi>Samaritans,</hi>
but also of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who conceived of God as a
<hi>spirit,</hi> and so worshipped him. Had he insisted on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
on the worship of the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> and set
worshipping God in <hi>spirit</hi> and in <hi>truth,</hi> only
in opposition to their worship, then this sense
had carried more probability along with it;
but it is evident that this worshipping God in
<hi>spirit</hi> and in <hi>truth</hi> stands in opposition as well
to the <hi>Jewish</hi> as the <hi>Samaritan</hi> worship, and
therefore this cannot be the meaning of them.</p>
            <p>3. Others think by worshipping God in <hi>spirit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Voi quid sit <gap reason="foreign">

               </note>
we are to understand the worshipping of him not
only with the <hi>outward,</hi> but the <hi>inner</hi> man, and
by worshipping him in <hi>truth,</hi> the worshipping
him in <hi>righteousness;</hi> telling us that <gap reason="foreign">

promiscuously. <hi>Those</hi> (say they) <hi>worship in
righteousness, that worship in truth, and those wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
in truth, that worship in righteousness.</hi> Thus
<hi>Heinsius.</hi> But this seems not to be the sense; For,
though it be very true, that to worship God in
<hi>spirit,</hi> is to worship him with the <hi>inner</hi> man, and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52743:12"/>
that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> are put some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the one for the other; yet this sense a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
not with the <hi>adversative,</hi> which we are to
have great respect to, as yielding much light to
the finding out the meaning of the words. Our
<hi>Saviour</hi> tells the woman, <hi>ye worship ye know not
what, we know what we worship,—but</hi> (saith
he) <hi>the hour cometh and now is, when the true
worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and
in truth.</hi> By which <hi>adversative</hi> it appears,<note place="margin">Haec verba manifestè significant dominum loqui de a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doratione novâ, quâe antea non erat &amp; quae initium haberet a Christo. t 3. <hi>de missâ.</hi> l. 1. c. 11.</note> that
the worshipping God in <hi>spirit</hi> and in <hi>truth</hi> is a
worshipping of him in such a way, as is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
both from that of the <hi>Samaritans</hi> and
the <hi>Jews.</hi> And so far <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is in the right
when he saith, <hi>these words manifestly signifie,
that our Saviour spake of a new way of worship,
which was not before, and which would have its
beginning from him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But according to this opinion, the worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God in <hi>spirit</hi> and in <hi>truth,</hi> is not different
from all former worship; in particular, not from
that of the <hi>Jews,</hi> for though many of them
were hypocritical and profane, yet were there
some amongst them that worshipped God with
the <hi>inner</hi> man, and in <hi>righteousness.</hi> To go no
further,<note place="margin">Luke 1. 6:</note> we read of <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth, who
were both righteous before God, walking in all the
commandments and ordinances of the Lord blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less.</hi>
It is not against the <hi>abuse</hi> of a lawful wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
that our <hi>Saviour</hi> speaks, but against the
worship it self according to its <hi>institution,</hi> which
he would have laid aside, and another kinde of
worship of his own appointment, substituted in
the room of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:52743:12"/>
4. Others think that worshipping God in <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>
is here set in opposition to the <hi>carnal, external</hi>
worship of the <hi>Jews;</hi> and worshipping him in
<hi>truth</hi> to the <hi>fictitious, false</hi> worship of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritans.</hi>
And so they will have the words of
our <hi>Saviour</hi> to amount to thus much: both
<hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Samaritans</hi> worship the Father, the one
at one place, and the other at another; The
one in a <hi>carnal</hi> way, the other in a <hi>false</hi> way:
but the time is at hand, that both the one and
the other shall worship him after another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
The <hi>Jews</hi> laying aside their <hi>carnal</hi> worship,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Illud in spiritu ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludit cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum Dei tantummo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem &amp;c.</hi> in loc.</note>
shall worship him in <hi>spirit,</hi> and the <hi>Samaritans,</hi>
laying aside their <hi>false</hi> worship, shall worship
him in <hi>truth.</hi> And this sense <hi>Pererius,</hi> with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Jesuits,</hi> gives of the words. But, not to
repeat what I have already alledged, which
shews this cannot be the meaning, I see no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
wherefore <hi>spirit</hi> should be restrained to
the <hi>carnal external</hi> worship of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and
<hi>truth</hi> to the <hi>fictitious, false</hi> worship of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritans.</hi>
For, there was want of <hi>spirit,</hi> not
only in the worship of the <hi>Jews,</hi> but also of
the <hi>Samaritans;</hi> and there was want of <hi>truth,</hi>
not only in the worship of the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> but
also of the <hi>Jews.</hi> I understand not therefore
how this limitation may be justified.</p>
            <p>5. Others think to worship God in <hi>spirit,</hi> is
to worship him with the <hi>inner</hi> man; and to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
him in <hi>truth,</hi> is to worship him without
the use of such <hi>ceremonies</hi> as were types of things
to come; Not without the use of all <hi>ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,</hi>
but only such as were shadows of things
to come. They say, the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Samaritans</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:52743:13"/>
before the coming of Christ, worshipped God
with bloody <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> and with many rites and
ordinances depending thereon; which prefigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
some thing to come, but <hi>Christ</hi> being come
that was prefigured by them, he lets the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
know that this kind of worship should cease,
and that God would be worshipped after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
manner, <hi>sc.</hi> in <hi>spirit</hi> and in <hi>truth.</hi> As if he
had said, God will not now be worshipped in
the types of things <hi>expected,</hi> but according to the
verity of what is already <hi>exhibited.</hi> After this
manner speak <hi>Maldonate</hi> and others. But I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
not wherefore we should restrain the
words only to the exclusion of such ceremonies
as are figures of things to come.<note place="margin">Spiritus corporeo op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon tur lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co, veritas figuris, &amp;c. <hi>in loc.</hi>
               </note> They are a
plain assertion of the <hi>spirituality</hi> and <hi>simplicity</hi>
of Gospel worship, which will consist no better
with other ceremonies, than such as are shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
of things to come. Should we worship
God in the use of as many ceremonies as the
<hi>Jews</hi> did, though they were not figures of things
to come, but of things past or present, yet our
worship would be no more in <hi>spirit</hi> and in
<hi>truth</hi> than theirs. Besides, it is to be observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that Christ at his coming, did not only ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate
such ceremonies as were typical, and sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
forth things to come, but such as by their
signification taught moral duties. I could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
in several ceremonies, that were no more
typical than the ceremonies in these times con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
for, be: and yet Christ at his coming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolished
them, and caused them to be laid aside,
removing every thing that might hinder the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
of that administration he intended to put
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52743:13"/>
his Church under. And therefore there is no
more warrant for the institution, observation,
or imposition of other ceremonies, than for those
which are typical, unless they are such as Christ
himself hath appointed. But hereby we see what
hard shift superstitious men will make, before
they will yield to the abolishing of those <hi>burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some</hi>
and <hi>sinful</hi> innovations they have introduced
into the worship of God, to the woful deprave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereof, and hindring us of that blessing that
otherwise we might expect upon it. Yet, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
all their heat, and tenaciousness,
they will grant us this, that from these words
of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> we may inferr the abrogation
of the <hi>Jewish</hi> ceremonies, and that concession
is sufficient for our purpose. Let those that
would have new ones, produce their warrant for
them. Let them shew but as good authority
for the <hi>institution</hi> and <hi>observation</hi> of them, as we
can do for the <hi>abolition</hi> and <hi>abrogation</hi> of these,
and we will joyn with them. Without question
had it been the mind of <hi>Christ</hi> that his Church
under the Gospel, should have worshiped him
in the use of ceremonies,<note place="margin">In Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licâ lege nulla sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentalia (id est ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniae sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum) sunt insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuta à Christo Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mino, &amp;c. in 12 q. 108. a. 2.</note> he would either have
kept up the <hi>old</hi> ones, or else when he abolished
them, he would have instituted <hi>new;</hi> but herein
(setting out what I shall hereafter except) he
is altogether silent. And with this agrees that of
<hi>Medina; In the evangelical law</hi> (sai<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h he) <hi>there
were no sacramentals (that is, ceremonies belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to sacraments) instituted of our Lord Christ
because of the dignity and excellency of our sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which are so precious, that although they
were presented to us naked without the props of ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52743:14"/>
they would yet be worthy of all venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
Now he being <hi>faithful in his house,</hi> and
ready to prescribe every thing that might tend
to the orderly government and welfare thereof,
and yet being silent herein, may satisfie us, it
was his pleasure, that such kind of worship should
cease.</p>
            <p>6. Others think to worship God in <hi>spirit,</hi> is
to worship him with the <hi>inner</hi> man; and to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
him in <hi>truth,</hi> is to worship him not only
without the use of such ceremonies as typifie
things <hi>to come,</hi> but all other ceremonies what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
(saving those of divine appointment)
whether they typifie things to <hi>come,</hi> or things
<hi>past,</hi> or <hi>present.</hi> And so they will have the words
of our Saviour to the woman, to imply as much
as if he had said thus. You that are <hi>Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi>
worship the Father at <hi>Garizim,</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi>
at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and both of you (besides your
Temples wherein you celebrate your sacred
mysteries) have many <hi>types</hi> and <hi>figures,</hi> many <hi>sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows</hi>
and <hi>ceremonies;</hi> but know, that now the
time of this kind of worship is expired: God
will have his Church under a <hi>new</hi> administration,
and will be worshipped after <hi>another</hi> manner;
He hath for many hundred years been wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped
by you at <hi>Garizim,</hi> and by the <hi>Jews</hi> at
<hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and by both of you, in the use of many
<hi>rites</hi> and <hi>ceremonies, but the hour cometh and
now is when the true worshippers shall worship the
Father in spirit and in truth,</hi> &amp;c. And this sense,
as it agrees best with the context, so it is that
which the most learned, judicious and ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox
writers both ancient and modern give of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52743:14"/>
the words. <hi>Eusebius</hi> hath a very remarkable
passage. Disputing against the <hi>Jews,</hi> and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning
many eminent persons of the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that worshipped God <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>it is manifest that those blessed men and friends
of God did not worship in any certain determinate
place, neither by symbols</hi> and <hi>types, but as our
Saviour and Lord hath said, in spirit and in
truth.</hi> The substance of what he saith is this;
that in the dayes of the Old-testament, there
were several choice persons, famous in their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations,
that worshipped God without the
use of <hi>symbols</hi> and <hi>types,</hi> and that at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Christ,</hi> that kind of worship spread
throughout all nations, according as the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi>
had foretold. His words are not to be
restrained only to such <hi>symbols</hi> and <hi>types</hi> as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figure
things to come (though I believe he
aimes at such too, because he writes against
the <hi>Jews,</hi> most of whose <hi>symbols</hi> and <hi>types</hi> were
of that nature) but to be extended to such
<hi>symbols</hi> and <hi>types</hi> as signifie things either past or
present. For the better conceiving whereof,
you are to note that these words <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and
<gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, are ordinarily put, not only for <hi>figures</hi> of
things to come, but for the <hi>signa, indicia, si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudines,
imagines, figurae,</hi> or <hi>exempla</hi>
of things whether <hi>past</hi> or <hi>present.</hi> Briefly, his
design is to hold forth to the <hi>Jews</hi> that the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of those eminent persons before the Law,
was <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>simple,</hi> and that the Law (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
another kind of worship was established) is

               <hi>abrogated,</hi> and that it being <hi>abrogated,</hi> it ought
to be so now. Hereupon he labours to perswade
them to lay aside their <hi>ceremonies,</hi>

            <p>And that spirit is set in opposition to what is

or <hi>figurative,</hi> is the opinion of divers
others of the Ancients, as the Jesuites themselves
confess. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> saith, its the opinion of
<hi>Chrysostome, Cyril, Euthymius. Maldonate</hi> goes
further, and saith it was not only the opinion
of them, but of <hi>Origen, Tertullian, Hilary, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copius,</hi>
and <hi>Theophylact</hi> likewise. And of the
same perswasion are writers of a latter time.
<hi>Bucer</hi> saith that <hi>even by this one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> word, all use of

more care ought Christians to have of this, who
being taught to worship God in spirit and truth,
ought first and last to have abhorred the idle, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable,
and deceitful forms and rites of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters.</hi>
And <hi>Farel</hi> writing to <hi>Calvin</hi> about a
popish fellow whose name was <hi>Carolus,</hi> saith
thus; <hi>when Carolus would obtrude his significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

Grotius,</hi> and the whole stream of Protestant
Writers. I had collected their words and set
them down, but finding that they took up more
room, than in so small a tract may well be
spared, I thought it convenient to lay them by.
Those that have a mind to peruse them, may
have recourse to their Commentaries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notations
on the Text, and there find them.
They do for the most part so distinguish, as
that they set <hi>spirit</hi> in opposition to what is <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
corporeal, external;</hi> and <hi>truth</hi> to what is
<hi>figurative, ritual,</hi> and <hi>ceremonial;</hi> but they do
not all, I confess, precisely observe that distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
yet they do all from hence declare against
the use of Ceremonies in New-Testament wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;
not only against the use of <hi>Jewish</hi> Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
but others likewise. I know some<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of
them (as well as the Ancients before them)
speak with reference to the <hi>Jewish</hi> and <hi>Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi>
Ceremonies (and so without question, our
Saviour did too; for what other, carrying the
least colour of authority or reason, were there
then for him to speak against?) but yet not so,
as if they thought those were the only <hi>ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi>
that fell under our Saviours censure. That
they never thought the <hi>Jewish</hi> and <hi>Samaritan</hi>
Ceremonies, were the only ceremonies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
by our Saviour, appears in this, that
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52743:16"/>
they alledge this place against the <hi>Papists,</hi> and
their Ceremonies, accounting it a good and solid
argument against them. Besides such as have
commented upon it, and so have taken occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to urge it against them,<note place="margin">Panstrat. t. 3. l. 20. c. 6. sect. 22, 26. <hi>p.</hi> 756, 757. De Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jud. Eccl. Rom. <hi>c. 29. p.</hi> 580.

Bucan,</hi> with many more, in writings of another
nature, improve it against them. Now if it be
a good argument against the Ceremonies of the
Papists, why may it not likewise be so against
the Ceremonies of others, who have derived
them from them? Indeed <hi>Contzen</hi> the Jesuite,
saith that <hi>spirit</hi> and <hi>truth</hi> are here opposed to
<hi>hypocrisie,</hi> and the <hi>vanity</hi> of certain of the <hi>Jews,</hi>
and all the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> rather than to <hi>figures;</hi>
but herein he is not only contradicted by the
body of <hi>Protestant</hi> writers, but by his own
friends, <hi>Bonaventure, Jansenius,</hi> nay <hi>Ribera</hi>
and others of his own order, in what they
have writ on the place. In a word, our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi>
well foreknew not only how loth the
<hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Samaritans</hi> would be to part with
those Ceremonies, which they had so long
made use of, but likewise how prone others
in after-ages would be to a Ceremonious, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious,
pompous Worship, and therefore
saw it needful to speak, not only against the
Ceremonies of the <hi>Samaritans</hi> and <hi>Jews</hi> in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
but also, all Ceremonies in general;
and this he doth in these words, <hi>They that
worship him, must worship him in spirit and in
truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. I am now to give you the <hi>grounds</hi> of the
<hi>point,</hi> and shew you wherefore it is the duty of
the sons of men in these dayes of the Gospel
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52743:16"/>
to worship God in <hi>spirit</hi> and in <hi>truth;</hi> And I
shall first speak of worshipping him in <hi>spirit.</hi>
Now they ought to do that for these <hi>Reasons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Because it is the will and pleasure of God
whom they are to worship,<note place="margin">Dei volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas est ratio rationum, nec tantum recta sed regula. Bonavent. in sent. l. 1. dist. 41. q. 2.</note> that they should
so do.<note place="margin">Qui in om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sam inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rere velit abyssum scrutatur &amp; abysso profundius quid, quia voluntas Dei causa cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarum est. <hi>Mornaeus</hi> de verit.

any thing what a <hi>deity</hi> means, is a sufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
<hi>The will of God</hi> (saith the <hi>Seraphick</hi> Doctor)
<hi>is the reason of reasons, and not only right, but
the rule of our proceedings.</hi> And latter writers
speak to the same purpose. As his <hi>power</hi> is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited
and his <hi>wisdome</hi> infinite, so his <hi>authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
is supream, and his <hi>freedome</hi> absolute, and
therefore he may both do what he will himself;
and appoint what he will have us to do, and it
is not for such worms as we are, either to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist,
or censure him. Earthly Potentates we
may censure, for they are under Law themselves
as well as we, but it is not so with God; he
is not under any Law, save the Law of his own
most holy and righteous will, in the choice and
determination whereof we stand bound, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
both of that natural and professed allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
we owe to him, under the harshest ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments
and distastfullest occurrences to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiesce
and rest satisfied. He needs not the
advice or help of any of his creatures whether
<hi>Angels</hi> or <hi>men</hi> to assist him in the management
of his affairs. He made the world without
them, redeemed his Church without them, and
he knows how to govern it without them. And
the reason wherefore he doth this, and not that,
and appoints this, and not that, is not any natural
necessity, or debility that is in him, for he is
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52743:17"/>
al-sufficient, but it is his own pleasure. I may
say in this case as our Saviour did in the like:<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
so O Father, because it seemed good in thy
sight;</hi> or as it is in the original, <hi>because it was
thy good pleasure.</hi> Now that it is the will and
pleasure of God, that we should worship him
<hi>in spirit,</hi> is evident. <hi>And now Israel</hi> (saith he)
<hi>what doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but

               <hi>to walk in all his wayes

not only require us to serve him, but to serve
him with the <hi>heart,</hi> and not only with the heart
in an indefinite way, but with every part of it.
The heart is a thing he stands so much on, that

               </gap> but
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, not <hi>sacrifice,</hi> but <hi>sacrifices,</hi> to intimate
to us that this one sacrifice is instead of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sacrifices. And with this doctrine of the
old-testament agrees that of the new. <hi>We must</hi>
(saith Paul) <hi>do the will of God, from the heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:52743:17"/>
This phrase <hi>from the heart,</hi> doth not here stand
in opposition to, <hi>with the heart,</hi> as sometimes
it doth, but in coincidency with it. He doth
not mean we must serve him from something else,
and not <hi>the heart,</hi> but from <hi>the heart</hi> and nothing
else. He would have our service to be cordial,
sincere, hearty service, free from that abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
hypocrisie and formality, that attends the
performances of unsanctified, carnal, graceless
men. But that God would have us to worship
him <hi>in spirit,</hi> I need not go so far for proof of;
the very text shews it. <hi>Such</hi> (saith Christ)
<hi>the Father seeks to worship him;</hi> thereby intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
that he doth not only allow of such kind of
worship, but require it, expect it, and take com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency
in it.</p>
            <p>2. Because to worship God in <hi>spirit</hi> is more
agreeable and sutable to his nature than other
kind of worship. <hi>Sutableness</hi> is desirable in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing, and therefore should not be neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the servcie of God. As we would have him
to furnish us with <hi>sutable</hi> mercies, so we should
yeild to him <hi>sutable</hi> service. Now to worship
God in <hi>spirit</hi> sutes better with his nature, than
other worship doth. He is not made up of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and form, subject and accident, act and
power, or the like ingredients, proper to crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
beings, but is a most <hi>simple essence.</hi> He
consists not of a gross, corporal substance like
the Heathen <hi>Idols</hi> made of <hi>silver</hi> and <hi>gold,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 134. 15.</note> that
<hi>have mouths and speak not, eyes and see not, ears
and hear not,</hi> but is a most pure <hi>spirit,</hi> as void
of matter, as he is of either sin, or mortality.
Hence that of the Prophet, <hi>to whom will ye

tell us, that he is a <hi>spirit?</hi> And if he be a <hi>spirit,</hi>
then to worship him in <hi>spirit,</hi> must needs be
more proper than to do it in another way. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this manner our <hi>Saviour</hi> himself reasons;
<hi>God is a spirit, and they that worship him, must
worship him in spirit.</hi> It is <hi>Argumentum à

said, God is a <hi>spirit,</hi> and therefore they that
worship him, must worship him in <hi>spirit.</hi> For
though the <hi>illative,</hi> or <hi>rational</hi> particle, be not
<hi>expressed,</hi> yet it is evidently <hi>implyed;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we must not look upon the words as a
bare <hi>precept</hi> only, requiring us to worship God
in <hi>spirit,</hi> but also as a rational <hi>argument,</hi> to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52743:18"/>
induce us to it. And indeed, what can be more
rational than, that if God be a <hi>spirit,</hi> we should
worship him in <hi>spirit?</hi> For, if it be reasonable
that since men have <hi>bodies,</hi> we should reverence
them with the <hi>body,</hi> it must then needs be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
that since God is a <hi>spirit,</hi> we should
worship him with the <hi>spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Because to Worship God in <hi>spirit,</hi> is the
most excellent kind of worship. As it is such
worship as agrees both with his <hi>will</hi> and <hi>nature,</hi>
so it hath a peculiar excellency in it, above all
other worship, and that in respect of the effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
or subject, from whence it proceeds, which
is the <hi>inner man,</hi> or <hi>reasonable soul.</hi> And what
a rare and excellent piece that is, is worthy the
pen of an Angel to describe. It is not a thing
of such mean and homely <hi>extraction</hi> as the body
made up of earth, water, and other elements,
ready to tumble into the grave, not and putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie,
every day; it's of a more divine and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<hi>descent,</hi> and of a more refined and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
<hi>nature,</hi> indued with several noble,<note place="margin">

The Jewish <hi>Rabbi</hi>'s have such an high esteem of
it, that they <hi>compare</hi> it in divers respects to <hi>God</hi>
himself. And not only they, but <hi>Plato, Tully,

fairest <hi>flower</hi> in all the reasonable creature, the
<hi>jewel</hi> in the Cabinet, the <hi>diamond</hi> in the ring, and
so pretious that it is of more worth than all the
riches of the <hi>Indies,</hi> nay than all the <hi>World.</hi>
According to that of our <hi>Saviour; what is a
man profited,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 16. 26.</note> 
               <hi>if he shall gain the whole world
and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give
in exchange for his soul?</hi> Hence it is that wise
men, who understand somewhat of the <hi>nature</hi>
of it,<note place="margin">Psal. 22. 20.</note> set such an high value upon it. <hi>David</hi>
calls it his <hi>darling. Deliver</hi> (saith he) <hi>my soul
from the sword, my darling from the power of
the dog.</hi> The word here rendered <hi>darling,</hi> is
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which signifies <hi>my only one,</hi> and so is
rendred by <hi>Pagnine</hi> and others. Whereby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
he valued his <hi>soul</hi> so much, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
nothing else besides it. Nay he was so
choice and tender of it, that he would trust it
with <hi>none</hi> but God, and therefore commends it
to him.<note place="margin">Psal. 31. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Into thine hands</hi> (saith he in another
place) <hi>I commit my spirit:</hi> He looked upon
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52743:19"/>
the worth of it as so <hi>great,</hi> and the welfare
of it as so much <hi>concerning</hi> him, that he thought
none fit to be trusted with it but <hi>God,</hi> and
therefore passing by all others, both <hi>men</hi> and
<hi>angels,</hi> he commits it only to him. He esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not any <hi>place</hi> safe enough, but the Cabinet
of Gods gratious providence, wherein he locks
up the <hi>souls</hi> of all his servants; and therefore
he commits it to him, to be preserved and kept
by him. And hence it is likewise that God
himself makes such account of it, and stands so
much on it, calling for it from every <hi>person,</hi> and
looking for it in every <hi>duty;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 23. 26.</note> 
               <hi>My son</hi> (saith he)
<hi>give me thy heart.</hi> He doth not say, thy <hi>body,</hi> thy
<hi>head,</hi> or thy <hi>hand,</hi> but thy <hi>heart.</hi> He stands not
so much upon those things, as he doth upon the
<hi>heart.</hi> That he looks for in every <hi>ordinance</hi> and
in every <hi>performance.</hi> And hence it is likewise
that <hi>Satan</hi> aims so much at it, laying all the
<hi>baits</hi> he can to insnare it, mattering neither one
thing,<note place="margin">Job 1. 7.</note> nor other,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 5. 8.</note> so he can but gain it. <hi>He
goes about like a roaring lyon,</hi> ranges up and
down, compasses Sea and Land, and all to make
a prey of <hi>souls.</hi> Other <hi>Lyons</hi> prey upon <hi>bodies,</hi>
but he preys upon <hi>souls.</hi> Now all these things
bespeak the <hi>excellency</hi> of the <hi>soul.</hi> Were not
the nature of it very pretious, neither <hi>man,</hi>
nor <hi>God,</hi> nor <hi>Satan</hi> would make such account
of it. And by how much the soul is more <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent,</hi>
by so much the <hi>worship</hi> performed
by it, is the more <hi>excellent.</hi> By how much
the <hi>soul</hi> is more <hi>excellent</hi> than the <hi>body,</hi> by so
much the <hi>worship</hi> of the <hi>soul</hi> is more <hi>excellent</hi>

worship of the gods</hi> (saith he) <hi>is that we

most <hi>excellent</hi> part of man and worshipping in
<hi>spirit,</hi> be the most excellent kind of <hi>worship,</hi> then
certainly it belongs to God, and ought to be
rendered to him. For, as he is the donor and
Lord of all we have, so he is worthy of, and
looks for whatever is most <hi>excellent</hi> from us.
If the <hi>first-born</hi> he the most excellent, he looks
for that; if our <hi>first-fruit</hi> be most excellent,
he looks for that; and if there be a <hi>male</hi> in our
flock, he looks for that: and will not take it
well if he be denyed. Since then, worshipping
him in <hi>spirit,</hi> is the most <hi>excellent</hi> kind of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,<note place="margin">Exod. 22. 29.</note>
we may well make account he expects it
from us.</p>
            <p>4. Because till we worship him in <hi>spirit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mic. 7. 1.</note> we
worship him in <hi>vain.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mal. 1. 14.</note> Though a man spend ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so much time and treasure in worshipping
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:52743:20"/>
God, yet if his <hi>spirit</hi> ingage not in it, all is to
no purpose. Though he should with the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
offer whole <hi>Hecatombs</hi> of sacrifices, yet if
his <hi>spirit</hi> concurr not in the work, all would
be ineffectual. This the <hi>Scripturs</hi> is most clear
in; witness that of the Prophet: <hi>Wherewith
shall I come before the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mic. 6. 6, 7, 8.</note> 
               <hi>and bow my self
before the high God? shall I come before him
with burnt offerings, with Calves of a year old?
will the Lord be pleased with thousands of Rams,
or with ten thousands of Rivers of Oyl? shall I
give my first-born for my transgression, the
fruit of my body for the sin of my soul? He
hath shewed thee O man what is good, and what
doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly,
and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy
God.</hi> The people were convinced that it was
their duty to please God, but they knew not
how to do it. They thought great and costly
Sacrifices, of <hi>Calves, Rams, Oyl,</hi> and such like
things would have done it; but the Prophet
teaches them another lesson: he lets them
know, that was not the way, and withall shews
them, there was something else, which they
minded not, that was more acceptable to him
than any such matters, and that was <hi>justice,
mercy,</hi> and <hi>humble walking.</hi> These he shews were
far more pleasing to God than all those Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious
and costly Sacrifices they kept such a
stir with, and put so much confidence it. Both
the <hi>Israelites</hi> and <hi>jews,</hi> in the time of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacy
were much in external <hi>sacrifices</hi> and
services;<note place="margin">Hos. 6. 4.</note> and what were they better for it?
<hi>O Ephraim</hi> (saith God) <hi>What shall I do unto
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:52743:21"/>
thee? for your goodness is as a morning cloud,
and as the early dew, it goeth away.</hi> What is
emptier than the <hi>morning cloud,</hi> and what is
lighter than the <hi>early dew?</hi> a blast of wind
dispels the one,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Alludit ad Israelita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, &amp; Judaeorum justitiam quae tota fita erat in externis sacrificiis &amp; Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niis</hi> Zanch. in loc.</note> and a beam of the Sun exhales
the other. How came it to pass then, that the
goodness of <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> had no more
substance and solidity in it? why, because they
rested in their external services and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances,
not regarding in the mean time, that
which they should mainly have looked after.
Nay, God doth not only make light account
of <hi>unspiritual</hi> services, but he rejects and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hors
them as things abominable; <hi>Bring</hi> (saith
he) <hi>no more vain oblations, incense is an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
to me.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 1. 13.</note> Though the Sacrifices they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
him, were of his own appointment, and
typified the death of his Son who was so dear
to him, yet in regard they proceeded not from
the <hi>heart,</hi> but were tendered to him in an <hi>hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical</hi>
way, he refuses to receive them,
speaks of them under terms of highest dislike
and disdain, tells them plainly they were hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and loathsome to him. And he doth not
only reject and abhor such kind of service, but
severely punishes it.<note place="margin">Isa. 29. 13, 14.</note> 
               <hi>For as much</hi> (saith he)
<hi>as this people draw near me with their mouth;
and with their lips do honour me, but have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
their heart far froms me, and their fear
towards me is taught by the precept of men:
therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous
work amongst this people, even a marvellous
work, and a wonder, for the wisdom of their wise
men shall perish, and the understanding of their
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52743:21"/>
prudent men shall be hid.</hi> And this truth the
modern <hi>Jews,</hi> though a people very prone to
rest in outward services, do confess and own
in an eminent manner. <hi>Buxtorf</hi> saith, <hi>that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the very walls of their Synagogue,</hi>
               <note place="margin">De Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brev. <hi>p.</hi> 186.</note> 
               <hi>they have
this sentence written, Prayer without the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

or prayer-book,<note place="margin">Spicileg. <hi>p.</hi> 64.</note> they have this pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
to the same purpose; <hi>Where withall shall I
come before his face, but with my spirit, for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is more pretious to a man than his soul?</hi>
And the <hi>Papists</hi> too, for all their <hi>peregrinations,
processions, images,</hi> and gawdy stuff, speak after
the same manner.<note place="margin">

               <hi>Estius</hi> writing upon the
Text, saith, <hi>Our Saviour requires that kind of
worship which is most excellent, and which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
necessary, and without which bodily wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
is unprofitable and vain.</hi> Nay the wiser
sort of the very Heathens own it. <hi>Plutarch</hi>
saith, <hi>Its incredible that the gods delight in the
outward beauty of creatures.</hi> And if he held
that the gods delight not in the outward beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of creatures, we may fairly conclude he
also held, that they delight not in the outward
dress of services, when there is nothing of
inward <hi>affection</hi> and <hi>devotion.</hi> It appears then
not only from Scripture (the sentence whereof,
is of it self sufficient in all matters of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
but from the confessions of those very
<hi>sects</hi> that are likeliest to think otherwise, that
God is to be worshipped with the inner man
as well as with the outward, and that the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
of the latter without the former are vain
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:52743:22"/>
and ineffectual; and therefore it concerns us
if we should worship him in an acceptable, suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessfull
way, to ingage the one in it, as well as
the other.</p>
            <p>And thus I have given you the reasons of
the former branch of the Doctrine, shewing
you wherefore the sons of men ought in these
dayes of the Gospel to worship God in <hi>spirit;</hi>
not that I think it is so their duty, to do it now,
as that it was not their duty to do it in the
dayes of the Law, or that he did not require it,
or expect it then, or that many did not then
do it, but that he requires it and looks for it
<hi>now</hi> in a peculiar way, affording greater means
to enable them to it, now, than he did then.
<hi>Paul</hi> in that famous Sermon of his to the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi>
saith,<note place="margin">Act. 17. 30.</note> 
               <hi>Now God commandeth all men every
where to repent;</hi> not that he did not command
them to do it <hi>before,</hi> for he did it all along both
by his <hi>Prophets</hi> and his <hi>Providences;</hi> but that
now he commanded them to do it in a more
especial manner, presenting to them greater <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centives,</hi>
and laying before them stronger <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi>
to do it. And the like may be said in the
present case.</p>
            <p>I shall now proceed to the latter <hi>branch</hi> of
the Doctrine, and shew you wherefore the sons
of men ought in these dayes of the Gospel to
worship God in <hi>truth.</hi> The reasons thereof
are these;</p>
            <p>1. Because God himself hath ordained and
appointed them to worship him in that way.
And were there nothing else, this <hi>fingle</hi> reason
were sufficient, not only to warrant their doing
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:52743:22"/>
of it, but incite them to it. For, as he may just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
challenge <hi>worship</hi> from us, so he may justly
prescribe what <hi>way</hi> he will be worshipped by us.
His <hi>Church</hi> is his Kingdom, and it belongs to
him to make laws for his own Kingdom, and set
dówn what way his subjects therein shall express
their respect to him, and serve him. It is not
for us to set down wayes of worship our selves,
but to observe the way that he in his word hath
set down for us. And the way that he therein
hath set down for us, is this, that we do it in
<hi>truth,</hi> that is, without the use of Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.
If you inquire after the part wherewith
you are mainly to serve him, he tells you, You
must do it in <hi>spirit;</hi> and if you inquire after
the external mode or dress, he tells you, You
must do it in <hi>truth,</hi> not in a gawdy, pompous
manner, but in a way of holy <hi>simplicity</hi> and
plainness. This is the way that he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
and he would have us in all cases,
how difficult, and strange soever they be, to look
upon his appointment as a sufficient ground for
us to proceed upon. It was a difficult task that
<hi>Joshuah</hi> was to undertake, when he was to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<hi>Moses</hi> in the government and conduct of
<hi>Israel,</hi> and to lead them over <hi>Jordan</hi> among the
<hi>Canaanites,</hi> whom he was to dispossess and
drive out before them; yet God would have
him to look upon his command as a sufficient
ground for him to undertake the business.
<hi>Arise</hi> (saith he) <hi>go over Jordan,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Josh. 1. 2, 9.</note> 
               <hi>thou and all
thy people, into the Land which I give unto them;
have not I commanded thee?</hi> q. d. Though the
difficulties thou art to encounter with be great,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:52743:23"/>
and the dangers that lye before thee be many,
yet surely at my command thou maist venture
upon the work; why, know for thy incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement,
that I have commanded thee. Nay
the very <hi>Heathens</hi> had such apprehensions of
God, that they thought there was no neglecting
of his commands, but that they ought by all
means to be observed and obeyed.<note place="margin">Ezra 7. 23.</note> 
               <hi>Whatsoever</hi>
(saith Artaxerxes) <hi>is commanded by the God
of Heaven, let it be diligently done.</hi> We may
dispure of cases before God determine them,
but when he hath once passed sentence, all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputings
must cease. Till his command come
forth, we are at liberty, and may take which way
we please, but when that is once out, then our
liberty ceases, and we must take that way only
that he therein chalks out for us. Then we
must turn all our disputings and contests into
silent submission; and all our inquiries and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
into cheerfull obedience. If then, God
hath appointed us to worship him in <hi>truth,</hi> as
it plainly appears by the <hi>Text</hi> he hath, then we
ought without any disputing or drawing back
to do it.</p>
            <p>2. That the Scriptures may be fulfilled. The
Scriptures are not only <hi>doctrinal,</hi> but <hi>propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal;</hi>
they do not only contain <hi>precepts</hi> of holy
living, but <hi>predictions</hi> of things to come to pass
in after-times. As God hath therein set down
whatever he <hi>would</hi> have us to do, so he hath
there set down, much of what he himself <hi>will</hi>
do. And amongst other things he hath declared
he would do, this is one, that he would put
his Church in the dayes of the New-Testament,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:52743:23"/>
under a <hi>spiritual</hi> administration, wherein he will
not have her worship him as in times past, in
the use of <hi>shadows</hi> and <hi>ceremonies,</hi> but in a more
<hi>plain</hi> and <hi>simple</hi> manner, even in <hi>truth. Behold
the dayes come</hi> (saith the Lord) <hi>that I will
make a new Covenant with the house of Israel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 31. 31.</note>
               <hi>and with the house of Judah.</hi> Upon our viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>covenant</hi> of works, God was pleased
to grant forth a <hi>Covenant</hi> of grace, promising
therein pardon and salvation to the penitent
and believing. And this covenant he thought
fit to have dispensed under a double admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,
that of <hi>Moses,</hi> and that of <hi>Christ.</hi> The
former he appointed to be carryed on in a way
of <hi>types</hi> and <hi>figures,</hi> agreeable to the state of
the church in the <hi>Old</hi> Testament; the latter, in
a way of <hi>spirituality</hi> and <hi>simplicity,</hi> agreeable
to the state of the Church in the <hi>New.</hi> And
this it is that the <hi>Prophet</hi> relates to, in this place,
when he speaks of a new <hi>Covenant.</hi> For, we must
not think that the <hi>Covenant Israel</hi> was under
in the time of the <hi>Old</hi> Testament, and the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi>
we are under now, in the time of the
<hi>New,</hi> are two seral <hi>Covenants,</hi> essentially and
substantially different, but one and the same
<hi>Covenant,</hi> passing under two distinct admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations;
the former of which was <hi>typical</hi> and
<hi>ceremonious,</hi> the latter <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>simple.</hi> The
covenant that they were under <hi>then,</hi> and we
are under <hi>now,</hi> differ no more than one and
the same person differs from himself in several
<hi>habits</hi> or <hi>dresses</hi> Briefly, the words of the
Prophet imply as much as if he had said, in the
dayes of the New Testament when <hi>Jesus</hi> Christ
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:52743:24"/>
the bridegroom of the Church shall come down
from Heaven to her, she shall put on new vest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
go in a new garb, and serve him in a new
manner, not in that <hi>ceremonious, puerile</hi> dress
she was in before, but in a more <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>grave</hi>
habit, even in <hi>truth.</hi> And with this agrees
that which God spake by a Prophet of a latter
standing;<note place="margin">Mal. 1. 11.</note> 
               <hi>in every place</hi> (saith he) <hi>incense
shall be offered to my name, and a pure offering.</hi>
Its usual with the sacred pen-men (as the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi>
themselves who alledge this place for the
<hi>Sacrifice</hi> of the <hi>Mass,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vid <hi>Rainol.</hi> his Conf. with <hi>Hart. c.</hi> 4. <hi>divis,</hi> 4. <hi>p.</hi> 473.</note> confess) to speak of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel</hi>
Ordinances and duties under <hi>legal</hi> terms;
and so this Prophet doth in this place. By <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense</hi>
and <hi>offering,</hi> he means not such as the <hi>ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial</hi>
law required, and as the <hi>Jews</hi> in the
Old Testament in conformity thereunto, used,
(he well knew that such things upon the death
of <hi>Christ</hi> the great <hi>Sacrifice</hi> were to be laid
aside) but he means somewhat of a more <hi>spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi>
nature, having analogy or agreement
therewith, as prayer, thanksgiving, and the like,
which are our Gospel <hi>incense</hi> and <hi>offering,</hi> and
which we are to tender to God in <hi>these</hi> dayes,
as they did their bloody Sacrifices, and such like
matters in <hi>those:</hi> of this there is no doubt; all
the question is, what is meant by this attribute
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>pure:</hi> and wherein the <hi>purity</hi> of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
<hi>incense</hi> and <hi>offering</hi> doth consist.<note place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Mede Diat. in loc.</hi>

and <hi>Gentiles</hi> was, <hi>modo corporuli,</hi> by slaying of
Beasts and such like work, but in a <hi>spiritual</hi>
manner, by putting up of <hi>prayers,</hi> giving of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:52743:24"/>
               <hi>thanks,</hi> singing of <hi>Psalms,</hi> with other duties of
that nature. Others think, it denotes <hi>consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiam
offerentis,</hi> the good Conscience of the
offerer, not polluted with misapprehensions, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief,
hypocrisrie, as the Consciences of both
<hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> were, but sound, believing,
and upright. Others (restraining the words
to the Sacrament of the <hi>Eucharist</hi>) think it
denotes <hi>rem significatam,</hi> or the thing repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
in it, which is <hi>Jesus</hi> Christ, who is a
sacrifice, not like one of the <hi>Jews,</hi> corrupt and
polluted, but immaculate, and perfect, without
spot or blemish. But the first seems to be most
probable, and therefore is embraced not only
by <hi>Justin Martyr,</hi> and <hi>Tertullian</hi> among the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients
(as the above mentioned Author con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses)
but likewise by the ablest and soundest
modern writers. <hi>A Lapide</hi> mentions it as the
common opinion of the <hi>Protestants;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Calvinus <hi>&amp; haercties qui negant omnè sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficium legis novae pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prie di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum, acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piunt obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticam,</hi> &amp;c. in. loc.</note> 
               <hi>Calvin</hi>
(saith he) <hi>and the hereticks, who deny all sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice

offering mystically, that is to say, for the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God by faith, hope, charity, prayer, invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
praise, and pious works, especially those
of mercy, almes, and conversion of souls.</hi> And
he confesses that <hi>Clarius</hi> and <hi>Vatablus</hi> were of
the same mind. The sense then, of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
we may take to be this, that the Church
of God in the dayes of the New-Testament
is to worship him in a more <hi>pure, spiritual, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
manner then heretofore. Though the
worship she yielded to him in the time of the
Old Testament was of Divine institution, yet
was it not so <hi>pure</hi> as this here foretold, because
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:52743:25"/>
it was attended with, and wrapped up in so
many <hi>outward</hi> ceremonies. Her worship then
was a <hi>mixt</hi> kind of worship, partly consisting
of <hi>outward</hi> ceremonies, and partly of <hi>inward</hi>
devotion; but the Prophet here foretells, that
when the time of <hi>reformation</hi> should come,
she should serve him after another manner;
that she should then offer him <hi>a pure offering.
Calvin</hi> makes this place parallel with the Text,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dicit nune in Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem verita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem &amp; nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam doceri,</hi> &amp;c. in loc.</note>
looking upon it as a prophesie of the <hi>spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality</hi>
and <hi>simplicity</hi> of <hi>Gospel</hi> service, which is
not to be folded up as the <hi>legal</hi> was, in <hi>rites</hi>
and <hi>ceremonies,</hi> but to be carryed on in a grave
and plain manner. To be short, as our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi>
in the Text sets <hi>truth</hi> in opposition to <hi>cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,</hi>
so doth the Prophet in this place set
<hi>pure:</hi> both of them holding forth this truth,
that God would have his Church in these days
of the Gospel to worship him without the use of
them. Now if it be true, that the <hi>Scriptures</hi>
have foretold, that God would put his Church
in the dayes of the Gospel under a <hi>spiritual</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration,
and have her to worship him in
<hi>truth,</hi> then we ought all to do it. We must
not only take notice of prophecies, but (so far
as the keeping of our places, and callings will
permit) contribute our assiftance towards the
fulfilling of them. God often joyns the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment
of his prophecies, and the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of our duty together, so that the one is
done, in, and with the other. And thus it is
in this case; and therefore if we would see
him accomplish the <hi>one,</hi> we must betake our
selves to the performance of the <hi>other.</hi> We
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:52743:25"/>
must not (as many do) get prophecies into
our minds, and then stand gazing to see what
will be done, but we must out of a true zeal
to the name of God which is concerned therein,
do what we can to help them to the birth. God
foretells in the forementioned places, that <hi>all
shall know him</hi> and <hi>call upon him;</hi> now we
must not only wait to see these things accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished,
but we must endeavour in the places
wherein we are, that they may be accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
So he doth in like manner foretell, that
his people in the New-Testament shall worship
him in <hi>truth,</hi> that is, without Ceremonies;
now we must not stand looking about us to see
what others will do, and do nothing our selves,
but we must put to our helping hand, and do
what we can towards the promoting and furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of the work.</p>
            <p>3. Because the time designed by God for
our worshipping of him in <hi>truth</hi> is come. As
the time designed by him for his peoples wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping
him in the use of <hi>Ceremonies</hi> is expired,
so the time designed by him for their worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
him in <hi>truth</hi> is come. That he once al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
nay commanded them to worship him
with <hi>ceremonies is</hi> granted, but that administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was not to be <hi>perpetual,</hi> but <hi>temporary;</hi> it
was not to continue <hi>alwayes,</hi> but (as some of
the Jewish <hi>Rabbi's</hi> themselves confess) to abide
for a certain season,<note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monid.</hi> de Fund. <hi>cap. 9.</hi> p. <hi>121.</hi>
               </note> and then to be laid aside.
But choose what they say, <hi>Paul</hi> is very clear
in it; <hi>The Law</hi> (saith he) <hi>was our School
master, to bring us unto Christ, that we might
be justified by faith.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 24, 25.</note> 
               <hi>But after that faith is
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:52743:26"/>
come, we are no longer under a Schoolmaster.</hi> By
<hi>faith</hi> he means not <hi>actus animae,</hi> or that grace
whereby we are justified, but <hi>tempus Evangelii,</hi>
or the dayes of the New-Testament, in which
there is no necessity, of such <hi>Ceremonies</hi> as the
Church before the coming of the <hi>Messias</hi> stood
in need of. The <hi>Ceremonial</hi> Law was no other
than <hi>Evangelium velatum,</hi> or Gospel with a
mask, or veil upon it, directing to, and pointing
at Christ in all the parts of it. Amongst all those
rites that they used, there was not one, but it had
its signification, and there were very few of them,
but they did in some degree, or other, referr
the <hi>Jews</hi> to Christ, and Preach him to them. We
must not think that all those <hi>ceremonies</hi> God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
them were empty <hi>ciphers,</hi> signifying no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
(that were to reproach both his wisdom
and goodness) no, they served as so many
<hi>stars</hi> to light them in those dark times to their
expected <hi>Messias,</hi> who was typified by them.
And herewith agrees that speech of a worthy
and elegant Author;<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> of the style of Script. <hi>p.</hi> 82.</note> 
               <hi>The Ceremonial Law</hi>
(saith he) <hi>was like the manger to the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards,
holding forth the infant Jesus wrapped
in his swadling cloaths.</hi> But that you may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
see that the <hi>ceremonious</hi> administration was
not to be <hi>perpetual</hi> but only for a <hi>season,</hi> the
same Apostle tells us, that the Church was under
it,<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 2.</note> 
               <hi>till the time appointed of the Father;</hi> and what
time is that? why, time of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> in
which such an administration is both <hi>unnecessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
and <hi>unreasonable.</hi> And, as if this were not
sufficient,<note place="margin">Heb. 9. 10:</note> he tells us in another book, that the
<hi>legal</hi> ordinances were imposed on the <hi>Jews</hi> only

that is, the coming of <hi>Christ,</hi> who was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
by God to reform the Church. In the
absence of the <hi>Sun</hi> the <hi>Stars</hi> give us light, but
when it rises, they disappear; so, before the
coming of <hi>Christ,</hi> God taught the <hi>Jews</hi> by the
<hi>ceremonies,</hi> but when he was come, he appointed
them to be laid aside. Then it was that the <hi>day</hi>
of the Gospel administration brake forth,<note place="margin">Cant. 2 17</note> and
the <hi>shaddows of the morning</hi> fled <hi>away.</hi>
            </p>

Syntag<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> part. 1. disput. 24 de Conseq. sect. 6. p.</hi> 345.</note> let us here note that the thre
is a thereefold <hi>period</hi> of time, to which the <hi>cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies</hi>
may in different respects be referred.
There was a <hi>time</hi> when they were <hi>necessary</hi> and
<hi>requisite;</hi> a <hi>time</hi> when they were <hi>indifferent</hi> and
<hi>tolerable;</hi> and a time when they became <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull</hi>
and <hi>sinfull.</hi> They were <hi>necessary,</hi> from
the <hi>time</hi> of their institution to the death of
<hi>Christ,</hi> which they were appointed to prefigure.
Though <hi>Christ</hi> came to abolish them,<note place="margin">Luk. 2. 21. Mat. 5. 23.</note> yet he
did not do it till the time of his death, because
till then there was nse for them. That he did
not abolish them upon his <hi>birth,</hi> appears by
his Parents <hi>circumcising him,</hi> and <hi>offering for
him according to the Law.</hi> And that he did
not abolish them upon his <hi>preaching,</hi> appears
by the directions he gives to such as brought
their <hi>gifts to the Altar;</hi> by his commanding
the <hi>Leper</hi> to <hi>shew him self to the Priest, and offer
the gift that</hi> Moses <hi>commanded;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 8. 4. Luk. 22. 15.</note> and by his
celebrating the Paschal <hi>Supper</hi> with his Discipler.</p>
            <p>They were <hi>indifferent</hi> from the <hi>time</hi> of his
<hi>death,</hi> till the destruction of the <hi>Temple,</hi> which
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:52743:27"/>
was it self the grand <hi>ceremony,</hi> and fear of the
rest. That they were not then <hi>necessary,</hi> doth
abundantly appear by the discourses of <hi>Paul</hi>
touching their abrogation, some passages where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
I gave even now; as also, by his publick
disowning the <hi>Jewish</hi> Priesthood. When the
<hi>Jews</hi> blamed him for reviling <hi>Ananias,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 23. 5. saying <hi>revilest thou Gods High-Priest?</hi> he answered, <hi>I wist not brethren, that he was the High-Priest.</hi> q d. You look upon him as Gods <hi>High Priest,</hi> and own him for such, Non nove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram quod sit sacerdos, suppeditari capite adb 8. ubi docet Apostolus non ultra in terris sed in coelis quaerndum <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>&amp;c. Clop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penb. Schol. Sacrif.</hi> p. 153. <hi>Rev. 8. 3. Act.</hi> 16. 3. 18. 18. 21. 24.</note> but I know no such thing.
The time was, when your <hi>Priest-hood</hi> was
of divine institution, and I owned it as such:
but now the case is otherwise; <hi>Jesus</hi> Christ
hath now taken that office wholly upon himself,
being set down at his Fathers right <hi>hand,</hi> where
having a Golden <hi>Censer</hi> and much incense in it,
he offers <hi>it with the prayers of all Saints, upon
the golden Altar which is before the Throne.</hi>
That they were not then <hi>sinfull,</hi> appears by his
<hi>circumcising</hi> of <hi>Timothy, shaving</hi> his <hi>head</hi> after
the manner of the <hi>Nazarites, purifying</hi> himself
according to the Law. These things at that
time he accounted <hi>indifferent,</hi> and for the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of the Gospel he conformed to them.
Had the Apostles immediately upon the death
of <hi>Christ,</hi> utterly renounced the <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> and
thrown them out of the Church, it would in
all probability have been a great hinderance to
the Gospel, especially as to the <hi>Jews,</hi> who
had such a setled esteem of them; and therefore
in point of <hi>prudence,</hi> and for the <hi>furtherance</hi>
of the Gospel (which they were to use all law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
means to promote) they took another
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:52743:27"/>
course; they did not assoon as ever they
saw <hi>Christ Crucified,</hi> run into the <hi>Temple,</hi> and
pull all to piece, but they first proved the
<hi>Ceremonial</hi> Law abrogated, and that the use
thereof was not <hi>necessary</hi> but <hi>indifferent:</hi> and
when they saw that took, and that the Gospel
had got some footing; and also perceived that
some pressed the observation of the <hi>Ceremonies</hi>
to a bad end,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ceremoniae veteres co tempore non quidem obl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igabant amplius; cum tamen templum nondum esset destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum, &amp; illud temnpus hoaeest-concedere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur earum sepulturaa, erant obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vationis liberae.</hi> Jo. Crocius AntiWeigel. part 2. p. 156.</note> they boldly protested against
them, and asserted their own liberty. Besides,
though the Apostles were not ignorant that the
<hi>ceremonies</hi> were only of <hi>positive</hi> and <hi>temporary</hi>
right, and that they did in law expire and dye
with <hi>Christ,</hi> yet they withall knew that they
were originally of <hi>divine</hi> institution and had
been long used by the Jewish Church with much
<hi>benefit;</hi> and therefore they took themselves
bound to give them decent and honourable
<hi>burial.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They became <hi>unlawful</hi> upon the destruction
of the <hi>Temple,</hi> and so they have been from that
time till this, and so they will remain till the
end of the world. <hi>Josephus</hi> tells us that a little
before the utter destruction of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> the
Priests on the day of <hi>Pentecost,</hi> going into the
inner <hi>Temple,</hi> to offer their accustomed Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
they at first felt the place <hi>move</hi> and <hi>tremble,</hi>
and afterwards heard a Voice saying, <hi>Let us
depart hence.</hi> And he likewise tells us a little
after,<note place="margin">De Bell. Jud. 1. 7. c. 12, 13. Joh. 11. 50.</note> that the Priests being taken, and desiring
<hi>Titus</hi> to spare theie lives, he (being moved,
as it were, by a <hi>divine</hi> impulse, as <hi>Caiaphas</hi> was
before him) answered, <hi>that it was fit, that
they should perish with the Temple. Grotius</hi>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:52743:28"/>
speaking on the <hi>Text,</hi> of the abolishing of the
<hi>ceremonial</hi> Law, faith, <hi>it was first done at the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication
of Christian liberty, called the time of
reformation; afterwards, by the destruction of
the two temples, that at</hi> Garizim, <hi>the other at</hi>
Jerusalem. It did doubtless <hi>de jure,</hi> or in <hi>law</hi>
expire,<note place="margin">Factum hot primum quidem pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licatione Christianae libertatiis, quod tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionis di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citur, &amp;c.

the <hi>veile</hi> of the <hi>Temple</hi> signified, but it did not
<hi>de facto, actually,</hi> or as to all use of it, expire
till the destruction of the Temple it self. But
since that time it hath utterly ceased, the
Church of <hi>Christ</hi> having all along disclaimed it
with the <hi>worship, sacrifices,</hi> and all the <hi>rites</hi> and
<hi>ordinances,</hi> pertaining to it. The Apostle <hi>John</hi>
speaking of her,<note place="margin">Rev. 12. 1.</note> with relation to her condition
about the time of <hi>Constantine,</hi>
               <note place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> in loc. Prov. 1. 9.</note> presents her to
us in a glorious and triumphant state, <hi>cloathed
with the Sun, having the Moon under her feet,
and on her head a Crown of twelve stars;</hi> all
which seems to bespeak her utter renouncing
of <hi>Judaism.</hi> She stands shining, not with <hi>legal</hi>
righteousness, but with the righteousness of <hi>Jesus</hi>
Christ. She uses not the <hi>ceremonial</hi> ordinances
here denoted by <hi>Moon</hi> (in regard, several of
them depended on it, and were in other respects
like it) but looking on them as <hi>beggarly ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
she treads them under her feet. She
professes not the doctrine of the <hi>twelve
tribes,</hi> as formerly she did, but of the
<hi>twelve Apostles,</hi> which she wears as <hi>an orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of grace, to her head, and chains about her
neck.</hi> And after this manner she hath carryed
her self all along, rejecting the <hi>Jewish</hi> paeda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogy
as antiquated, and out of date, never
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:52743:28"/>
to be used more by her, save to mind her of
her former state, and Gods dealings with her
therein. I know there are some Christian
Churches,<note place="margin">Brerewoods <hi>enq.</hi> p. 153. 156, 165.</note> that make use of some of the <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
rites</hi> at this day. The <hi>Ethiopians</hi> (as also
the <hi>Jacobites, Aegyptians, Habassines</hi> and
others) to <hi>baptism</hi> joyn <hi>circumcision;</hi> yet do
they not do it upon a <hi>sacramental,</hi> but <hi>politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi>
account, that by that mark they may be
distinguished from other Nations to be the
seed of <hi>Abram.</hi> And there are some of our
reformed <hi>Divines</hi> that would excuse them, but
others condemn them of <hi>superstition,</hi> and lay
down very weighty arguments against their
practice in this particular. And it is not so
considerable what some <hi>particular</hi> Churches do,<note place="margin">

as what the <hi>universal</hi> doth; or what a <hi>corrupt</hi>
Church doth, as what those do that are more
<hi>reformed</hi> and <hi>pure;</hi> or what any Church doth
<hi>without</hi> warrant from the word, as what it doth
<hi>by</hi> it. It is evident from what I have alledged
out of Scripture, that the <hi>ceremonial</hi> law is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
abolished, and the antient Church took it
to be so; if therefore any endeavour whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>directly</hi> or <hi>indirectly</hi> to revive or keep it
up, it is little as to matter of argument to be
heeded. And so much for proof of this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
that the time designed by God, for
his peoples worshipping him in the use of <hi>cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies</hi>
(particularly of the <hi>Jewish)</hi> is expired.
As for those that would have others, let them
shew their warrant for them; but of that I
shall perhaps speak hereafter.</p>
            <p>4. Because the worshipping of God in <hi>truth</hi>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:52743:29"/>
is such a kind of worship as is more <hi>proper</hi> for,
and doth better become the Church in these
dayes of the Gospel, than other kind of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
We must distinguish of times; that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration
that may fit the Church at one
time, may not at another. To have worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
God without the use of <hi>ceremonies,</hi> would
not have fitted her in the time of the <hi>old
Testament;</hi> and to worship him <hi>with</hi> the use
of them, will not fit her in the time of the
<hi>New.</hi> The Apostle compares the Church of
the Old-Testament to an <hi>infant,</hi> and shews how
God furnished her with such an administration
as became her infancy;<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 1.</note> intimating withall,
that now in the time of the New-Testament
she is come to more <hi>maturity</hi> and <hi>perfection,</hi> and
that thereupon he hath pur her under a new
administration, even such a one as is <hi>suitable</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it. That there is much difference betwixt the
administration,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> the Church was under in the time
of the <hi>Old</hi> Testament, and that she is <hi>now</hi> under, in
the time of the <hi>New,</hi> is evident to all. <hi>Eusebius</hi>
speaking of the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Law, calls it the <hi>tutor</hi> or
<hi>guardian of puerile and imperfect souls.</hi> Hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God appointed his Church the use of such
<hi>types</hi> and <hi>figures.</hi> as might help her to some
apprehensions and conceptions of future things,
but the <hi>day spring</hi> from on high having visited
her,<note place="margin">Demonst. Evang. <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 6. <hi>p.</hi> 16.</note> she is now in such a condition that she
needs not those <hi>rudiments</hi> that formerly she
did; and it is greatly injurious to her for any
to attempt the reducing her back to the use
of them. She doth not now look at Christ
through the Window, or behold him through

a man, and <hi>ruler</hi> of all the Land of <hi>Aegypt.
When I was</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>a child, I spake
as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a
child, but when I became a man, I put away child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
things.</hi> Thus it is with the Church: she
hath her <hi>progressions</hi> and <hi>periods,</hi> as well as every
single person;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 11.</note> and that garment which became
her in her <hi>minority,</hi> will not at all become her,

<hi>Augustine,</hi> illustrates this by a very fit simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude;
<hi>There was</hi> (saith he) <hi>a youth that being
diseased, addressed himself to</hi> Vindecianus <hi>the
Physician, who gave him a Medicine fit for his
age, and cured him. A good while after, the
youth being become a man, be fell into the same
disease again, and applyes the receipt he used be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
but it agreed not then with him. Here up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
be betook himself to his Physicain telling him
he wondered, he would give him such Physick as
would hurt him. The Physican demands of him,
when he gave him that Physick? he told him
when he was a youth, at which time it cured
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:52743:30"/>
him, whereas it was now likely to kill him. The
Physician replyed, that the physick proved not good,
because it was not taken at his command; that
that which was wholsome to him being a youth,
was now deadly to him being of age.</hi> The like
we may say of the Church: when she was in
her <hi>youth,</hi> a ceremonious, pompous administ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
appointed her by God, was <hi>proper</hi> for her
and <hi>whol some,</hi> but now she being come to age
(and God nowhere appointing it her) it
would be <hi>mortal</hi> and <hi>deadly.</hi> And what if after
all this I bring you a famous <hi>heathen</hi> that by
the very light of nature gives suffrage for
us in this point? Hear then what <hi>Plato</hi> saith,
<hi>Men ought of worship God, not counterfeiting
with shadows, but pursuing vertue in truth.</hi>
Had not the man lived before our <hi>Saviour,</hi>
I should have thought he had fetched this truth
from him, as well as he did many others from
<hi>Moses;</hi> but he dyed so long before his time,
that we may take it for granted, it was the
naked suggestion of the light of nature,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. In Epino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid.</note> which
teaches, it is fitter for us to worship God in a
<hi>plain simple</hi> way, than with <hi>figures</hi> and <hi>sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows.</hi>
And so much for the reasons also of
this second <hi>branch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. Having thus dispatched the <hi>reasons</hi> of the
point, I shall now for preventig of mistakes,
lay down some <hi>cautions</hi> or <hi>limitations;</hi> and I
shall confine my self to these two.</p>
            <p>1. Though it be the duty of the Sons of men
to worship God in <hi>spirit,</hi> or with the inner
man, yet we must not understand this (as some
have dangerously done) to the prejudice, or
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:52743:30"/>
exclusion of worshipping him with the <hi>body</hi> or
<hi>outward</hi> man. Such was the sottishness of that
raving impostor <hi>Hen. Nicholas,</hi> that he taught,
that all <hi>ordinances,</hi> hearing,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>See his Epist. to the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of</hi> Warwick. sect. 5, 7, 10.</note> preaching, Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
learning, baptism, the Lords Supper; all
<hi>confessions</hi> of Christ before men, all <hi>externalls</hi>
in religion, were things of no worth, indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
free, trivial, laid on us by no law of God.
This, I confess, is doctrine likely for that <hi>wild</hi>
head of his to devise, and that <hi>blasphemous</hi>
tongue of his to utter, but far different from
what the Holy-Ghost dictaed to the Prophets
and Apostles. As God would not have us to
worship him with the body <hi>only,</hi> so neither
would he have us to worship him with the soul
<hi>only,</hi> but with <hi>soul</hi> and <hi>body</hi> both <hi>together.</hi> He is
maker and Lord, both of the one, and the other,
and therefore he expects to be worshipped with
the one, as well as with the other. When he calls
so much for our worshipping him in <hi>spirit,</hi> he
doth not thereby exclude, or discharge us from
worshipping him with the <hi>body;</hi> he never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
any such thing. He calls upon us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
to worship him with the <hi>spirit principally,</hi>
but not <hi>only.</hi> Thus the Saints of old, (acted
and guided by the <hi>Holy Ghost)</hi> ever under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
him, and therefore did not only imploy
their <hi>spirits</hi> in worshipping him,<note place="margin">Act. 20. 36. Joh. 11. 41. Psal. 77. 1. 134. 2. Luk. 18. 13.</note> but their <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi>
also. To instance in the duty of prayer;
therein they bowed their <hi>knees,</hi> lifted up their
<hi>eyes, voice, hands;</hi> smote upon their <hi>breasts,</hi> and
the like; thereby teaching us, that when we
imploy our selves in the worship of God, we
must not only ingage the <hi>soul,</hi> but the <hi>body</hi>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:52743:31"/>
likewise.<note place="margin">Treatise of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. <hi>part. 2. p. 138.</hi>
               </note> And <hi>Amyrald</hi> (who writes against
such <hi>quodlibetick</hi> spirits) tells us, that <hi>there never
was any Nation, that thought it enough to serve God
in thought only, without making demonstrations
of their devotion, by gestures, and external acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
And though bodily exercise as it is sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle,
and divided from the spirit, doth (as the
Apostle saith) <hi>profit little,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 8.</note> yet when it joyns
with it, it profits much. It <hi>assists</hi> the <hi>spirit,
elevates</hi> the heart, <hi>inflames</hi> the affections, <hi>excites</hi>
to devotion, and makes us far more lively in
the service of God, than otherwise we should
be. What difference is there commonly in the
intention of mens affections, betwixt their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
only <hi>inwardly</hi> in the <hi>spirit,</hi> and outwardly
with the <hi>voice?</hi> what <hi>deadness</hi> and <hi>straitness</hi> do
usually attend the one, and what <hi>life</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement</hi>
the other? Hence we find that the
ancient <hi>Christians,</hi> when they set upon the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of God, did on purpose take in the <hi>body</hi> to
assist the <hi>soul,</hi> and further their devotion in it.
Witness that of <hi>Augustin: by words</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vertis &amp; aliis signis ad augen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum deside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum nos ipsos acriùs excita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus. <hi>Ep. 121.</hi> Adjungi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur vox tali oratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, &amp;c. 22. q 83. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>2. c.</note> (saith he)
<hi>and other signes we greatly excite our selves to
increase holy desire.</hi> And upon this and such
like grounds, <hi>Aquinas</hi> teaches, <hi>that prayer,
though secret, may be vocal;</hi> or, that in our clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set-performances,
when we have no spectators
but <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Angels,</hi> we may use the voice.
<hi>Anatomists</hi> say, there are certain strings that
come from the heart to the tongue, so that
the <hi>agitation</hi> and <hi>motion</hi> of the tongue, doth stir
and shake the heart, and thereby awaken and
affect it, rendring it more vigorous and lively in
its present services. If therefore, when we
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:52743:31"/>
are waiting upon God in secret, we find our
hearts <hi>dead</hi> and <hi>liveless,</hi> we may make use of
the tongue, for the quickning of them, and
rendring them more fit, for the enjoyment of
communion with him, and better carrying on
of his service. The truth is, such is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposition
of our hearts to good, that they
are apt, like <hi>Eutichus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts. 29. 9.</note> to drop <hi>asleep</hi> in the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of God, and therefore we have need of
something to awaken them; and if we find
the voice will do it, we may use it. If we find
them lively and in good frame, and fit for the
service we are about, we may then spare it, and
pray as <hi>Hannah</hi> did,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 1. 13.</note> 
               <hi>in her heart;</hi> but if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
we may, and ought to use it. This I speak
of the duty of prayer, and that prayer which is
secret; the use of the voice is also necessary
when one prayes in the person of many, as the
<hi>Master</hi> in his family, or the <hi>Minister</hi> in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.
Those that are to joyn with them,
are to know what Petitions they make, and say
<hi>Amen</hi> to them, which they cannot do, except
they use the voice. And as the voice is thus to
be used in the worship of God, so must other
parts of the <hi>body,</hi> as the occasion serves, and the
nature of the duty requires. And this is the
common Doctrine of Protestants; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is an unworthy slander of <hi>Maldonate</hi> the
<hi>Jesuite,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Adorare, interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantur sola<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fide ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rare <hi>in loc.</hi> Psal. 120. 3.</note> that the <hi>Calvinists</hi> interpret worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
in <hi>spirit, a worshipping with faith alone,</hi> as
if they were Solifidians, and against all exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
services. Now <hi>what shall be done to thee
thou false tongue, sharp arrows of the Almighty

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:52743:32"/>
that the Devil ran away with <hi>Luther,</hi> that <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi>
dyed blaspheming, that <hi>Beza</hi> recanted, that
<hi>Junius</hi> had a cloven foot. Nay, this is as true
as that their St. <hi>Patrick</hi> caused the stoln Sheep
to bleat in the belly of him that had eaten it,
that St. <hi>Lupus</hi> shut the Devil all night up in a
Tanckard, that St. <hi>Dunstan</hi> held him fast by the
nose with a pair of Tongs, that St. <hi>Dominick</hi>
made him hold him the Candle till he burnt his
fingers, with abundance of such ridiculous,
childish fables, which yet their deluded vulgar,
take to be as true as the Gospel it self. Let

likewise for <hi>prayer,</hi> giving of <hi>thanks</hi> and <hi>inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency</hi>
of life. Nay their own <hi>Cajetan</hi> hath
spoken as much, if not more, upon this Text
for <hi>internal</hi> worship, than <hi>Calvin</hi> hath done.
<hi>In spirit, that is,</hi> (saith he) <hi>not in the Mount,

               </note> 
               <hi>not in any place, not with tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
worship, not with the tongue, but with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
worship consisting in spirit, that is, in the
mind, as it bears the office of the spirit, and layes
out it self in spiritual matters.</hi> What if <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi>
had said all this, then the angry <hi>Jesuite</hi>
would sure have opened his mouth indeed.
But we may not wonder that the Jesuites car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
it thus towards us. Their friend <hi>Jarrigius</hi>
hath told us what kind of dealing we are to
expect from them.<note place="margin">Answer to the Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of <hi>Beauses.</hi> p. <hi>30.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>It is</hi> (saith he, speaking to
one of them) <hi>your ordinary custome, according
to the secret and mysterious rules of the society,
to impose things upon the pastors of the reformed
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:52743:32"/>
Churches, in your injurious and treacherous refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
and make the world believe they say
what never came into their thoughts.</hi> A Jesuites
tongue then, is no slander; but no more of
this.</p>
            <p>2. Though it be our duty in these dayes of
the Gospel to worship God in <hi>truth</hi> or without
the use of <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> yet we do not understand
this to the exclusion,</p>
            <p>1. Of such Ceremonies as are of <hi>divine</hi> insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.
When <hi>Christ</hi> abolished the <hi>Jewish</hi> and
<hi>Samaritan</hi> Ceremonies, he instead thereof insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
some of another nature, that were to
continue. Of this sort are <hi>water</hi> in Baptism,
<hi>bread</hi> and <hi>wine</hi> in the Supper,<note place="margin">Primum omnium constat in ceremonia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arum albo esse sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menta, <hi>&amp;c.

Conf. art 21. p. 40.</hi>
               </note> with the several
actions pertaining to them. That these are
Ceremonies, both <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Protestants</hi> (as
<hi>Chamier</hi> shews) grant; and that they are
of <hi>divine</hi> institution, none but <hi>infidels</hi> will
deny. And these ceremonies (notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what hath been said) we willingly own
and observe, and both desire and endeavour
that others may do the like. And therefore
the <hi>Papists,</hi> as they wrong us in the former
case, so they do in this, telling the world
that we are against all Ceremonies whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.
This was it that occasioned that request
of the <hi>Lutherans</hi> to the <hi>Emperour Charles</hi>
the fifth at the Diet in <hi>Augusta: Let not</hi>
(say they) <hi>your imperial Majesty give credit
to those, who, that they may the better render us
odious, disperse strange calumnies against us.</hi> They
<hi>give it out that we abolish all ceremonies, and
all good manners in the Churches. These things
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:52743:33"/>
are notoriously false; we do not only preserve
such ceremonies as are of divine institution with
highest respect, but that we might increase the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
of them, have also taken away certain
late abuses, which have by the corruption of the
times been brought in, without any certain autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
contrary to Scripture, contrary to the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
canons, contrary to the example of the ancient
Church.</hi> So far they. We think it meet to
distinguish betwixt the <hi>institutions</hi> of God, and
the <hi>inventions</hi> of men; as for the <hi>former,</hi> we
readily embrace them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as for the <hi>latter,</hi> we
utterly renounce, and disclaim them.</p>
            <p>2. Neither <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> understand it to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
of such <hi>circumstances,</hi> as are necessary to
the solemn and decent carrying on of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God. As our <hi>Saviour</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what he saith in the <hi>Text,</hi> allows us the use
of the <hi>ceremonies</hi> above mentioned, so he doth
likewise, the use of such <hi>circumstances,</hi> as are
requisite to the orderly management of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
The main things belonging to his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
God himself hath determined, as what
<hi>ordinances</hi> he will have used, what <hi>discipline</hi> he
will have exercised, what <hi>officers</hi> he will have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed,
and what <hi>duties</hi> he will have performed;
and these must by all means be kept <hi>sacred</hi> and
<hi>inviolable.</hi> It lies not in the power of <hi>Church,
State,</hi> or any humane authority whatsoever, to
reverse or alter <hi>all,</hi> or <hi>any</hi> thing thereof; nay
it were intolerable presumption, so much as to
attempt it. What presumption then is the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> guilty of, that <hi>forbids</hi> so many things
that God <hi>allows</hi> and <hi>commands;</hi> and <hi>allows</hi>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:52743:33"/>
and <hi>commands</hi> so many things that he <hi>forbids?</hi>
therein (like their predecessors the <hi>Scribes</hi> and
<hi>Pharisees)</hi> making <hi>the commandment of God of
none effect by their tradition.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 15. 6.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Other things there are that be of less mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as the proper <hi>modes</hi> and <hi>circumstances</hi>
wherewith the forementioned institutions are
to be carryed on; and these he hath not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
<hi>himself,</hi> but left to the prudence of
the <hi>Church,</hi> in the choice and determination
whereof, she is to steer her course by those
general rules, the Holy-Ghost hath set down
in Scripture, for the guiding her in this matter.
To have set down particular directions for
every individual case that occurs and varies every
day would have been in endless matter,<note place="margin">Leges à me edentur non perfectae: nam esset infinitum. <hi>Cicero. t. 2. de Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gib. l. 2. p. 326.</hi>
               </note> and
have swell'd our rule, that now lyes in a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
compass, to no less than a stupendious vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminousness;
and therefore the Holy-Ghost
waving that, as both a needless and unprofitable
work, gave us only <hi>particular</hi> directions for
<hi>fundamentals,</hi> and <hi>general</hi> directions,<note place="margin">De rebus ad gubernati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siae perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nentibus Apostoli certos quos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam canones tradiderunt quos ordine subjiciemus, &amp;c. <hi>Cent. 1. l. 2. c. 7.

impowring and appointing the
Church, to accommodate and apply them to
particular cases so as might tend most to the
advantage and furtherance of the Gospel, and
her own edification and benefit. To tell you
what and how many these directions be, would be
a work too great for this place. Those who have
a mind to know them, may have recourse to
the <hi>Centuriators</hi> of <hi>Magdenburg,</hi> who have
with much diligence and exactness, collected
and digested them in the very words of the
Scripture, into an intire <hi>systeme</hi> of <hi>Canons</hi> or
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:52743:34"/>
rules of Church-Government. I shall only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
in those noted words of the Apostle to
the Church of <hi>Corinth. Let all things</hi> (saith he) <hi>be
done to edifying.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 26. 40. <gap reason="foreign">

and in order. Clemens Romanns</hi> who was his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
labourer, and wrote an Epistle to the same
place, hath a passage to the same purpose. <hi>We
ought</hi> (saith he) <hi>to do all things in order.</hi> That is
to say, in order to the due carrying on of Gods
worship, we must make choice of a fit <hi>time,</hi>
convenient <hi>place,</hi> decent <hi>habit,</hi> suitable <hi>gesture,</hi>
and such proper <hi>utensils</hi> as the nature of the
ordinance, and service we are about call for,
labouring by all means to avoid irreverence,
disorder and scandal. But whiles we are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
these and such like expressions, for a
liberty in this kind, we must take heed of stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them too far, and going beyond our bounds,
lest we fall into the <hi>tents</hi> of the <hi>Philistines.</hi> It
was through this passage that <hi>superstition</hi>
wound in her head, and afterwards introduced
the whole fardle of humane <hi>inventions.</hi> It is
through this gap that light and sensual men have
brought their innovations and vanities into the
worship of God, to the great prejudice of <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
and reproach of the <hi>Christian</hi> cause.
For whiles they pretend to do it for <hi>edifying,</hi>
they do little less than subvert the very <hi>worship</hi>
of God it self, presenting him with a company
of childish, foolish <hi>ceremonies</hi> instead of <hi>inward</hi>
devotion, managing the work that should be
carryed on with so much <hi>seriousness, spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality</hi>
and <hi>simplicity,</hi> as if it were a meer sport
or play, ordained on purpose for the gratifying
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:52743:34"/>
of the flesh. And whiles they pretend to do it
for <hi>decency</hi> and <hi>order,</hi> they beget little else than
disorder and confusion.</p>
            <p>I know very well, that many amongst us who
make the Scripture like the <hi>Materia prima,</hi> and
draw <hi>quidlibet ex quolibet,</hi> put great confidence
in this place of the Apostle, touching <hi>decency</hi> and
<hi>order,</hi> urging it upon all occasions in defence of
the Ceremonies. Dr. <hi>Burgess</hi> treading the steps
of <hi>Hosius, Eckius,</hi> and other Papists, who urge
it for their <hi>Sacramentals,</hi> makes great account of
it, telling us, it is the only place for the Churches
Power, in constituting Ecclesiastical <hi>Ceremonies;</hi>

but how little it makes either for him, or them,
divers learned men have at large shewed. And
the thing is of it self evident; for 1. The Apostle
speaks not of constituting, or making any <hi>New</hi>
matters, but of the due disposal and managing
of such things as were <hi>already</hi> made. 2. We must
understand him of such things as he in that
place discourses of, which occasioned this his
advice, and those were not <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> but meer
<hi>Circumstances</hi> of Order. He requires, that he
that <hi>speaks</hi> in the Church, speak in a <hi>known</hi>
tongue, so as he may be <hi>understood;</hi> that the
<hi>Prophets</hi> when they prophesie, do it <gap reason="foreign">

of others; that the <hi>women</hi> in Religious
Assemblies, keep <hi>silence,</hi> and the like; and what's
all this to mystical, doctrinal <hi>Ceremonies?</hi> 3. He
propounds a Rule, by which these, and such like
matters, must be regulated; <hi>let all things</hi> (saith
he) <hi>be done, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

            <p>But to return where I was; that Christ in <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstantials</hi>

of transgressing her bounds, and going too far;
and that both as to the <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>number</hi> of her

must (if she expect to be obeyed) take heed of
framing such things as are liable to just excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and imposing them on her members with
rigour and severity. Christ hath dealt tenderly
with <hi>her,</hi> and it may not become her to deal
austerely and harshly with <hi>them.</hi> As they, on
the one hand must remember to shew her <hi>filial</hi>
respect, beware of contemning her <hi>Authority,</hi>
and not but upon very weighty grounds reject
what she recommends to them; so, she on the

forth into an unbridled licentiousness, as the

<hi>Vses</hi> of the point.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:52743:36"/>
And 1. May be for <hi>Information,</hi> to teach us
these two particulars. 1.<note place="margin">Vse I.</note> That the Catholick
Church is <hi>invisible.</hi> Amongst other points dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
betwixt <hi>us,</hi> and the <hi>Papists,</hi> this is one,
<hi>Whether the Catholick Church be invisible?</hi> we
say it is, they say it is not. Dr. <hi>Whitaker</hi> (to
mention no more) hath learnedly and judicious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
discussed this point; and amongst other Texts,
which he urges for confutation of them,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Si ea sola sit vera Christi Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholica Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesia quae spiritu &amp; veritate Deum colit &amp; venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, tum Ecclesia Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholica est invisibilis, &amp;c. t. 1.</hi> Controv. 2. q. 2. de Eccles. p. 461.</note> this I
am now upon, is one. His Argument runs thus;
<hi>If that only (saith he) be the true Catholick
Church of Christ, that does worship and serve God
in spirit and in truth, then the Catholick Church
is invisible; but the former is true, and therefore
so is the latter.</hi> And indeed the consequence is
evident; for such as the worship is, such is the
Church. If the Worship be invisible, so is the
Church. If we see not who they are that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
God in <hi>spirit</hi> and in <hi>truth,</hi> we neither see
which is the true Church; for, that is <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
Christ hath appointed, and does enable that
Society which is his true Church, to worship him
with. Were the Church a body meerly <hi>politick,</hi>
like other incorporated Societies, the Papists
might upon better grounds, tell us, it is as visible
as the Commonwealth of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> or the
Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> but it is not so;
it is, as the Apostle calls it, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>a spiritual house,</hi> standing on a <hi>spiritual</hi> founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
made up of <hi>spiritual</hi> materials, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd
after a <hi>spiritual</hi> manner.<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 5.</note> Or were it a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
meerly <hi>Physical,</hi> they might on better grounds
plead for its <hi>Visibility,</hi> but it is not so: it is a
<hi>mystical</hi> body, and a <hi>spiritual</hi> body. Now that
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:52743:36"/>
which is <hi>spiritual,</hi> is not the object of <hi>sense,</hi> but
<hi>faith,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 44. Heb. 11. 1.</note> which <hi>is the evidence of things not seen.</hi>
The Church therefore being thus <hi>spiritual,</hi> is not
<hi>visible</hi> to the <hi>Eye,</hi> but <hi>credible</hi> (if I may so speak)
to the <hi>Mind.</hi> Hence that passage in the Creed,
<hi>I believe the holy Catholick Chruch;</hi> intimating,
its certain there is an holy <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> but
withal, that its <hi>invisible.</hi> Indeed, in respect of
its <hi>accidental</hi> and <hi>external</hi> form, it's <hi>visible,</hi>

               </note> and
as visible as other Societies; but in respect of its
<hi>essential</hi> and <hi>inward</hi> form, which is that which
gives it its being, and is mainly to be looked af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
it's altogether <hi>invisible.</hi> To know who
they be that <hi>profess,</hi> as Church-Members, is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
but to know who they be that believe, <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi>
and <hi>live</hi> as such, is not so. And thus much
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> grants; and what's this but to grant
us all we contend for, and say as we do?</p>
            <p>2. That a <hi>ceremonious</hi> Worship in the days of
the Gospel, is utterly unlawful and unwarrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
contrary to the <hi>will</hi> of God, the <hi>design</hi> of
Christ, and the <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>dispensation</hi> he hath
put his Church under.<note place="margin">Novas fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guras vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umb as ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las in Ec clesiam invehere nefariam esse auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciam, &amp;c. In loc.</note> This is <hi>Beza</hi>'s inference.
<hi>To introduce</hi> (saith he) <hi>new Figures, or any Shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
into the Church, we affirm out of the Word of
God (who does so expresly condemn all Will Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and in times past prohibited the bringing of
strange Fire to his Altar) is wicked audacious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
If it belong to God to prescribe his own
Worship, and he hath been pleased in his word to
do it, therein telling us that he will be worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
in <hi>spirit and in truth,</hi> (that is, as you have
heard, with the inner man, and in <hi>simplicity,</hi>
without the use of <hi>(ceremonies)</hi> then to introduce
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:52743:37"/>
and set up a <hi>ceremonious</hi> Worship, must needs be
<hi>wicked audaciousness.</hi> It is no less then an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronting
his <hi>Majesty,</hi> a contemning his <hi>Authority,</hi>
a resisting of his <hi>Will,</hi> and so no doubt will be
interpreted by him. Had he only commanded
us to worship him in <hi>general,</hi> and left the <hi>specifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi>
or manner of it to us, then we had been
free, and might have worshipped him either one
way or other, either <hi>with</hi> Ceremonies, or <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,</hi>
as our own inclinations had carried us. But
after he hath not only called upon us to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
him, but hath determined the manner of his
Worship, and said plainly, This kind of Worship
does best <hi>suit</hi> with me, this kind of Woship I
<hi>will</hi> have, this kind of Worship I <hi>seek</hi> after; for
us to go and set up another kind of Worship of
our own heads, and offer that to him, what is
it but to <hi>mock</hi> him? What is it but to tell him he
shall not be worshipped as <hi>he</hi> will, but as <hi>we</hi> will,
than which, what can be greater impudence?</p>
            <p>The second <hi>Vse</hi> may be for <hi>Reprehension,</hi> to
reprove two sorts of Persons.</p>
            <p>1. Such as worship God,<note place="margin">Vse II.</note> but not in <hi>spirit.</hi>
There are many that think if they do but wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
him with the <hi>outward</hi> man, they need not
trouble themselves about the <hi>inner;</hi> if they do
but present and engage their <hi>Bodies</hi> in the work,
it matters not what they do with their Spirits.
Though they hear that God is a <hi>Spirit,</hi> and would
have <hi>spiritual</hi> Worship, that he <hi>prefers</hi> it above
all other Worship, nay, that all other Worship is
<hi>vain</hi> without it, yet when they approach to him,
they present him with their <hi>Bodies,</hi> but with-hold
their <hi>Spirits.</hi> Thus the Worshippers of <hi>Baal</hi> used
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:52743:37"/>
to carry themselves;<note place="margin">1 King. 18. 26, 28.</note> witness <hi>Ahabs</hi> Prophets,
of whom the Scripture testifies, that when (upon
that famous contest betwixt <hi>Elijah,</hi> and <hi>them)</hi>
they prayed to <hi>Baal)</hi> they <hi>cryed aloud, leaped
upon the Altar, cut themselves after their manner,
with Knives and Lances, till the blood gushed out
upon them.</hi> They laid not out themselves in <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency</hi>
of holy affection, or <hi>spiritual</hi> importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but in shouting and making a noise, thinking
(according to the manner of the Heathens) that
they should <hi>be heard for their much speaking.</hi> And
when that would not do,<note place="margin">Mat. 6. 7.</note> they <hi>leap</hi> and <hi>cut</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
hoping thereby to stir up their careless
sleepy <hi>Deity</hi> to audience.</p>
            <p>But it is not <hi>Heathens</hi> only, that have content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
themselves with <hi>out-side</hi> Worship: Others
that either did or might have known better,
have done the like. Thus the <hi>Jews</hi> carried
themselves, as appears by that sad complaint of
God by the Prophet <hi>Isaiah: This People</hi> (saith
he) <hi>draw near to me with their mouth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa 29: 13</note> 
               <hi>and with
their lips do honour me, but have removed their
heart far from me.</hi> They worshipped God with
the <hi>outward man,</hi> with the <hi>incurvation</hi> of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
but not with the <hi>inner</hi> man, not with the
heart. Though they had heard much of the
<hi>Omnisciency</hi> of God, his <hi>indignation</hi> against Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie,
his <hi>calling</hi> for the heart, and the <hi>vanity</hi>
and <hi>detestableness</hi> of all services without it, yet did
they with-hold it from him. And thus the <hi>Scribes</hi>
and <hi>Pharisees</hi> behaved themselves in after times,
as appears by our <hi>Saviour,</hi> who complains of
them in these very words of the Prophet <hi>Isaiah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 15. 7, 8.</note>
which I have now recited: <hi>Ye Hypocrites</hi> (saith
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:52743:38"/>
he) <hi>Well did Esaias prophecy of you, saying, This
People draweth nigh unto me with their mouth,
and honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is
far from me.</hi> That which God looketh <hi>most</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that they kept <hi>furthest</hi> from him, that which
would have been most <hi>acceptable,</hi> that they were
<hi>lothest</hi> to part with. They made a great ado a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
their <hi>outward</hi> actions, and look'd that they
were acurate and decent, and in the mean time
their hearts which he call'd for, they <hi>with-held</hi>
from him.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>Papists,</hi> though they arose too late to
be mentioned in Scripture, yet are (as all know)
notorious for their vanity, both as to their <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi>
and <hi>Practice,</hi> in this particular. As to
their <hi>Doctrine,</hi> hear what the Jesuites (that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
of <hi>Angels,</hi> that flight of <hi>Phoenixes,</hi> as they
stile themselves) teach.<note place="margin">Myst. of Jes. p. 51, 123, 134.</note> Among other rare <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximes,</hi>
which they have fram'd to facilitate the
exercise of holy things, take these instead of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
They say it is enough to be bodily <hi>present</hi>
at the <hi>Mass,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Additio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, p. 82.</note> though a man be <hi>absent</hi> as to the
mind; provided he behave himself with a certain
<hi>external</hi> reverence: That a man fulfills the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of hearing <hi>Mass,</hi> even though he have not
the <hi>intention</hi> to hear it: That when two Persons
say over their <hi>Breviaries</hi> at the same time, they
may repeat each of them his Verse at the same
time, not troubling themselves about any thing
of <hi>attention,</hi> to what they do, because it is not
any way <hi>necessary.</hi> Nay, in order to Peoples
obtaining of Heaven (because they will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
be at the trouble of any <hi>active</hi> Devotions)
they let them know, it's sufficient for them to
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:52743:38"/>
have always a pair of <hi>Beads</hi> about the arms, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the manner of a Bracelet, or to have a <hi>Rosa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
about them, or some <hi>Picture</hi> of the Virgin.
These are strange <hi>Maximes</hi> (you'ld think) yet are
they deliver'd to us by no meaner men, than <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spar
Hurtado, Vasquez, Caramuel,</hi> and such
like. And if we leave them, and go to the <hi>Papal
Chair,</hi> the pretended seat of Apostolical Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and infallibility, what liberal Indulgences
does his Holiness grant upon most frivolous and
childish grounds? In the Chruch of St. <hi>Eusebius</hi>
at <hi>Rome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pet. Du Moulin</hi> Confut. of Purgatory <hi>c.</hi> 1. p. 8, 9.</note> they have (as a good Author tells us)
seven thousand four hundred fifty and four
<hi>Quarentines</hi> of days of <hi>very Pardon.</hi> for such
as shall bring thither any honest offering, and
afford (as the words of the Bull do run) <hi>manus
porrigentibus adjutriees,</hi> their helping hands to
such as seek to them. In the Church of <hi>St. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-deliver-us-from-the-pains-of-hell,</hi>
(for that is
the Churches name) there are daily granted
eleven thousand years of indulgence to such as
shall bring an honest offering; that is to say,
shall give (not to the poor indeed, but) to the
rich <hi>Monks.</hi> In the Church of St. <hi>Praxede,</hi> you
have daily twelve thousand years of <hi>very Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
and as many <hi>Quarentines of days,</hi> with the
<hi>remission</hi> of the third part of your sins, in such
manner, that visiting the Church <hi>three</hi> days in a
row, you shall purchase plenary <hi>pardon</hi> of all
your sins, and six and thirty thousand years by
provision, besides the <hi>Quarentines,</hi> which the
Popes have since increased, to sixscore thousand
years for every day.<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Edw. Sandys Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rop. Spec. p.</hi> 23.</note> And another Author of
eminent note, who was amongst them, tells us,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:52743:39"/>
that Pope <hi>John</hi> the twentieth, that he might
make things yet more easie, granted forth an
Indulgence, that every inclining of the head at
the Name of <hi>Jesus,</hi> should get twenty years par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.
And <hi>Hassenmallerus</hi> informs us, That being in
<hi>Rome,</hi> Cardinal <hi>Farnsey</hi>'s Notary gave him an
Image blessed by Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the Fifth,<note place="margin">Vid. Cham. Epist. Jes. <hi>p.</hi> 116.</note> in which
were inscribed these words; He <hi>that on the feasts
of the blessed Virgin Mary, falling down before this
Image, thrice saith his</hi> Pater-Noster, <hi>and</hi> Ave-Maria,
<hi>gains two thousand years Indulgence: and
he who devoutly worships it every day, gains twelve
thousand years Indulgence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you see what incouragement those that
pass for Guides and Leaders amongst them, give
their people, to rest in <hi>external</hi> services. What
their <hi>practice</hi> then is, they being generally
so Ignorant and Carnal as they are, you
may. (had you nothing of your own Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or common same to inform you) easily
imagine.</p>
            <p>But we need not travel so far from home for
instances of this nature: there are many, even
among our selves that stand deeply guilty of this
sin, serving God sometimes with their <hi>Bodies,</hi>
but seldom or never with their <hi>Souls.</hi> There
are many amongst us of such a frame, that if
they do but observe the <hi>Bell,</hi> come together into
the presence of God at the hour of Prayer, and
there abide a while with their <hi>Bodies,</hi> though
their <hi>Souls</hi> are at <hi>the ends of the earth,</hi> they think
they have done all that is commanded, and may
expect a blessing. They think if they can but
follow the <hi>Calendar,</hi> go over their <hi>Divine Offices</hi>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:52743:39"/>
(as they call them) stand up, kneel down, cringe,
bow, and answer in their turns, they have (chuse
where the heart is all this while) done God good
service. But alas, what's all this to the purpose?
What's all this in comparison of what God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires?
What's all this in comparison of one
serious, hearty, humble prayer, accompanied
with ture <hi>contrition,</hi> and lively <hi>faith? Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus
Copronimus,</hi> the Eastern Emperour was
wont to say, <hi>Quid sine pectore corpus? what's
the body without the soul?</hi> What are stately <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrals,</hi>
melodious <hi>Musick,</hi> costly <hi>Hangings,</hi>
rich <hi>Vtensils,</hi> gawdy <hi>Vestments,</hi> and all the <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures</hi>
and <hi>postures</hi> imaginable, without a praying
heart? Though our Worship be never so splendid
and pompous, decked with the most exquisite
humane ornaments, yet unless the <hi>heart</hi> ingage
in it, it is in vain, nay odious and abominable.
It is to be wished then, that men would stand less
upon matters of this <hi>nature,</hi> and look more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the <hi>heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Such as worship God but not in <hi>truth.</hi> Many
are of such a temper, that they know not how
to worship him, unless it be in a <hi>ceremonious</hi> way.
They have so inur'd themselves to <hi>Ceremonies,</hi>
and taken such affection to them, that they
scarcely know how to do any thing in the service
of God without them: so that take away them,
and you serve them as <hi>Jacob</hi> did <hi>Laban:</hi> you
<hi>take away their gods,</hi> and with them,<note place="margin">Gen. 31. 30.</note> their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
happiness, and all at once. Though they
hear over and over again, that God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
against such kind of worship, told them,
that it is not pleasing to him, that the time of it
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:52743:40"/>
is expired, and the like, yet they are not satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
but they must, and will have it. And herein
they much aggravate their sin, that not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renting
themselves with those <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> which
are of divine institution (whereof I gave you
account before) they frame others of their own
heads, which they do not only <hi>equal</hi> with, but
<hi>prefer</hi> before them. Thus the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees;</hi>
as if all those <hi>Ceremonies</hi> God appointed
by <hi>Moses</hi> had been too few, they must have some
of their own, which they were very exact (chuse
what became of the other) in the observation of.
What a stir did they keep about washing of
<hi>hands,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mark 7. 4.</note> 
               <hi>cups, pots, brazen vessels, tables,</hi> and such
like things, which they did not only use them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
but impose on others, and that with so
much zeal and rigour, that they were ready to
quarrel with <hi>Christs</hi> Disciples, because they did
not do, as they did? And what ado likewise did
they make with their <hi>Phylacteries</hi> and <hi>fringes?</hi>
not contenting themselves with those prescribed
by God,<note place="margin">Numb. 15. 38, 39.</note> they would have <hi>greater,</hi> such as would
be more <hi>seen,</hi> and with a louder <hi>voice</hi> proclaim
their zeal and sanctity. <hi>They made broad</hi> (saith
the Evangelist) <hi>their Phylacteries, and enlarged
the borders of their garments.</hi> They thought those
appointed by the Law were too little,<note place="margin">Mat. 23. 5.</note> and did
not sufficiently bespeak their good affection and
devotion (which they desired all might take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of, and admire them for) and therefore they
made them such as would be seen further, and
speak lowder, and these they wore with much
pride and ostentation.</p>
            <p>And in this <hi>ceremonious,</hi> superstitious humour,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:52743:40"/>
the <hi>Papists imitate</hi> them to the life. As they imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
them in their <hi>Hypocrisie,</hi> so they do like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
in their <hi>superstition.</hi>
               <note place="margin">

to. Nay, as if that were not sufficient, they

            <p>And how far many amongst us, that pretend
to be come out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and to have cast of
communion with her, do symbolize with them,
I need not tell you. Now what manifest dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeying,
nay, presumptuous contradicting is
this of <hi>Jesus</hi> Christ? Will he have the Law of
Ceremonies <hi>abrogated,</hi> and will men (and such
too as pretend to be his obedient servants) have
it <hi>continued?</hi> Does he say, God must be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped
<hi>without</hi> Ceremonies? and do they say,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:52743:41"/>
he shall be worshipped <hi>with them?</hi> What's this
but a thrusting themselves into his <hi>Throne,</hi> an
invading of his <hi>Authority,</hi> and a laying hold on
his <hi>Soveraignty</hi> and <hi>Dominion?</hi> What's this but
to charge him with <hi>insufficiency,</hi> and say, he is
unfit to govern the Church, or be the Head of
it? And is this the respect they have for him?
Is this the thanks they give him for their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption:
for his saving them from the curse of
the <hi>Moral</hi>- Law, and yoke of the <hi>Ceremonial?</hi>
Who would ever think that any that carry the
names of <hi>Christians,</hi> and desire the setting up
of his <hi>Kingdom</hi> and Government, should deal
thus unworthily with him? Either he is our
Lord, of not; fnot, why do we <hi>profess</hi> he is?
if he be, why do we not <hi>obey</hi> him?</p>
            <p>The third <hi>Vse</hi> may be for <hi>Exhortation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vse III.</note> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
all to worship God in <hi>spirit</hi> and in <hi>truth.</hi>
This is the Worship God himself hath prescribed,
and by his Son propounded to us, and therefore
let us all, without any <hi>disputing</hi> or <hi>drawing</hi> back,
close with it.</p>
            <p>1. Let us worship him in <hi>spirit.</hi> When ever
we come into his presence, let's beware we leave
not our <hi>spirits</hi> behind us;let's be sure we take
them along with us, and engage them in the
work. What ever service or duty we set upon,
let's be sure to imploy our <hi>spirits</hi> in it. <hi>Let thine
heart</hi> (saith God) <hi>keep my Commandments.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 3. 1.</note> The
<hi>heart</hi> is the thing he chiefly <hi>calls</hi> for, <hi>expects,</hi> and
<hi>eyes</hi> in all our performances; and therefore
when ever we address our selves to him, let's be
sure to <hi>bring</hi> our <hi>hearts</hi> along with us, <hi>present</hi>
them to him, and <hi>keep</hi> them in order, whiles they
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:52743:41"/>
are before him. When we go into his presence
to <hi>sanctifie</hi> his name, and <hi>humble</hi> our selves,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 15.</note> let's
do it with the <hi>heart.</hi> When we <hi>pray</hi> unto him,
<hi>praise</hi> him,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 7. 14. Isa. 26. 9. Psal. 9. 1. Col. 3. 16. 1 Chron. 30. 19.</note> 
               <hi>sing</hi> Psalms, let's do it with the heart.
When we <hi>read</hi> or <hi>hear</hi> his Word, <hi>receive</hi> the
Sacrament, or <hi>celebrate</hi> any other Ordinance;
let's do it with the heart. One <hi>grain</hi> of heart-ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
is of more account with him than <hi>Mountains</hi>
of all other services whatsoever. He would rather
have one <hi>bleeding heart</hi> offered to him upon the
<hi>Altar</hi> of his Sons <hi>Merits,</hi> than many thousands
of <hi>Oxen</hi> upon <hi>Altars</hi> of <hi>Stone.</hi> He is more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with the <hi>sighs</hi> of a contrite <hi>heart,</hi> than the
costliest <hi>incense</hi> that ever was presented to him.
The <hi>heart</hi> is the thing he hath pitch'd upon, and
he will either have it or nothing. He stands so
much upon it in all our sacrifices, that though
other things be mean, yet if <hi>that</hi> be there, to
animate and put life into them, he will accept of
them; and if other things be never so costly,
and <hi>that</hi> be wanting, he will not endure them.
Set the <hi>heart</hi> aside,<note place="margin">Isa. 66. 3.</note> and <hi>he that killeth an Oxe, is
as if he slew a man: He that sacrificeth a Lamb,
as if he cut off a Dogs neck: He that offereth an
oblation, as if he offered Swines blood: He that
burneth Incense, as if he blessed an Idol.</hi> Alas,
men mistake the nature of Religion, imagining it
consists in that it does not. They look to their
<hi>outward</hi> actions, and keep a great stir about
them, whereas he regards them not any further
than the <hi>heart</hi> concurs with them. What cares he
for the expression of the <hi>tongue,</hi> lifting up the
<hi>eyes,</hi> smiting the <hi>breast,</hi> bowing the <hi>knees,</hi> or any
such <hi>outward</hi> actions? he matters them not a jot
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:52743:42"/>
further than the <hi>heart</hi> joyns with them. What
cares he for a mans making a good <hi>Profession,</hi>
unless he have good <hi>affection;</hi> for his speaking
like an <hi>Angel,</hi> unless he mean <hi>accordingly;</hi> for
his seeming to be <hi>holy;</hi> unless he be so <hi>indeed?</hi>
What cares he for a mans <hi>outward</hi> ingaging in
the common duties of Religion, while he <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly</hi>
hates them; for his giving him the <hi>knee</hi>
in prayer, while he denies him the <hi>heart;</hi> for his
<hi>hearing</hi> the word while he does not <hi>believe</hi> it?
What cares he for his <hi>sitting</hi> with Christ at the
<hi>Sacrament,</hi> while he hath a design to <hi>betray</hi> him?
for his going in <hi>Pilgrimage</hi> to his Sepulchre,
while he daily <hi>crucifies</hi> him at home; for his
wearing <hi>hair-cloath</hi> on his back, while he nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes
<hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Hypocrisie</hi> in his soul? Do you
care for a man that <hi>smiles</hi> in your face, and
speaks you fair, but <hi>inwardly</hi> hates you, and
plots your ruine? No more does God care for a
mans <hi>specious</hi> pretences, unless his <hi>heart</hi> be with
him. If therefore you would worship God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly,
acceptably, comfortably, see that you
worship him in <hi>spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now that I may the better evince to you the
reasonableness of this worshipping God in <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
and provoke you to it, I shall offer to your
thoughts these following <hi>Queries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Whether hath not God propriety in your
<hi>souls,</hi> as well as in your <hi>bodies?</hi> Did not he make
the <hi>one,</hi> as well as the <hi>other?</hi> Did not he redeem
the <hi>one,</hi> as well as the <hi>other?</hi> Hath he not fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
you with proper and suitable supplies
for the <hi>one</hi> as well as the <hi>other?</hi> Nay, have not
you solemnly resign'd to him the <hi>one,</hi> as well as
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:52743:42"/>
the <hi>other?</hi> If you have, with what colour or
shew of reason, can you with-hold from him
the <hi>one,</hi> any more than the <hi>other?</hi> If we consult
the Scripture, we shall find, that though God
challenge a propriety both in <hi>soul</hi> and <hi>body,</hi> yet
he challenges a propriety in the former in an
especial manner,<note place="margin">Psal. 24. 4.</note> calling it his <hi>soul. That hath
not</hi> (saith he) <hi>lift up my soul to vanity.</hi> In the
Original, according to the <hi>Kethib,</hi> or <hi>Line,</hi> it is,
as our translation renders it. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>his soul,</hi> but
according to the <hi>Keri,</hi> or <hi>Marginal correction,</hi> it
is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>my soul;</hi> God thereby intimating that
the soul is <hi>his,</hi> and that in a <hi>peculiar</hi> manner, as
a thing that he hath title to in many respect.
But if you think this not clear enough, hear
what he saith in another place.<note place="margin">Ezek. 18. 4.</note> 
               <hi>All souls</hi> (saith
he) <hi>are in me.</hi> All Souls! yes, and all bodies
too; but <hi>souls</hi> are his in an eminent way. Every
<hi>soul</hi> in the world is his, made by him, under his
eye, and at his disposal. The souls of Parents and
Children, rich and poor, Princes and people, are
all his. Now, if the soul, as well as the body be
Gods, what more equal, than that you should at
his command worship him with it? were it your
own, you might with-hold it, but being his, and
that too, which he mainly respects, &amp; looks after,
you cannot without guilt of high injustice do it.</p>
            <p>2. Whether is he not worthy of your <hi>souls,</hi>
and the best service you are capable of doing him
with them? Though the <hi>soul</hi> be (as you have
heard) an excellent being, yet sure if it were far
better than it is, it were not too good for him.
What, did he not think it too good to bestow
it on you, and that before it was tainted with the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:52743:43"/>
least spot of sin, and will you think it now too
good for him? Nay, did he not think his own
<hi>Son,</hi> with all the blessings of the Covenant of
Grace too good for you, and yet will you think
your <hi>Souls</hi> too good for him, and with-hold
them from joyning with your <hi>Bodies</hi> in his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship?
There is not a Soul, no nor an Angel in
Heaven, that thinks himself too good to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in his service, but is ready to undertake
the meanest Office for him; and shall we poor
Mortals think our selves, or any thing belonging
to us, too good to be laid out for him? By
no means. We should rather say, Come Lord,
here is my Soul, take it to thy self, and use it as
thou wilt. It is indeed my <hi>Darling,</hi> but were
it ten thousand times better and dearer to me
than it is, I should not think it too good for
thee. Such as it is, it is thine; Oh that it were
better for thee!</p>
            <p>3. Whether should you not let him have that
in your Worship, which he <hi>judges</hi> and <hi>measures</hi>
all by? That you ought without question to do,
and consequently you ought to let him have the
heart, for that he <hi>reckons</hi> all by. <hi>Solomon</hi> saith
of a man,<note place="margin">Prov. 23. 7.</note> 
               <hi>As he thinketh in his heart, so is he;</hi>
that is, both in <hi>himself,</hi> and in Gods <hi>account:</hi>
As God finds his <hi>heart,</hi> so he esteems of him; if
he find it <hi>good,</hi> he esteems him <hi>good;</hi> and if he
finds it <hi>bad,</hi> he esteems him <hi>bad.</hi> And as he esteems
of every man by his heart, so he esteems of his
service by it. If the <hi>heart</hi> be in it, he accounts
it <hi>good,</hi> and if the heart be not in it, he accounts
it <hi>bad.</hi> Let a man but give God his <hi>heart,</hi> and
he over-looks other infirmities, and if he deny
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:52743:43"/>
him that, let him do never so much, it's all lost
labour. The Scripture affords instances of both:
On the one hand,<note place="margin">1 King. 15. 14.</note> 
               <hi>Asa,</hi> though a good King,
miss'd it in many things: he executed not the
Law upon his <hi>idolatrous</hi> Mother, remov'd not
the <hi>high-places,</hi> and the like; yet because his
<hi>heart</hi> was right, God accepted him. On the
other hand, <hi>Jehu,</hi> though a bad King, did many
good Works;<note place="margin">2 King. 10. 31.</note> destroyed <hi>Ababs</hi> house, slew the
Worshippers of <hi>Baal,</hi> with other good service;
yet because his <hi>heart</hi> was not right, all was in
vain. The <hi>Jesuites</hi> indeed, as if they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to make themselves the <hi>laughing-stocks,</hi> as
well as the <hi>hatred</hi> of all good Christians, speak
so lightly of the Souls engaging in the service of
God, as if it were indifferent whether a man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
what he does,<note place="margin">Vid. Becan. t. 3. c. 8. q. 1 sect. 10.</note> or not; nay, whether
he do it by himself or by another. Hence they
use, as a learned <hi>Writer</hi> of our own tells us,<note place="margin">Jesuitis est in more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leae lusu interse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendere, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Ames. Bell. Enerv. t. 2. p. 23 4.</note> to
cast the <hi>Die</hi> which shall say <hi>Prayer</hi> for the other.
Whether such Devotion as this be proper, or
like to find acceptance, let any one that hath but
one grain of a Christian <hi>Spirit</hi> left him, judge.</p>
            <p>4. Whether do you not employ your <hi>Souls</hi> in
far <hi>meaner</hi> and lower Offices than the service of
God? When you go forth into the World, do
not you take them along with you? When you
go out into your <hi>Shops,</hi> into the <hi>Market,</hi> into the
<hi>Fields.</hi> have you not them with you? Do you
not use their assistance in every Bargain, advise
with them in every <hi>Business,</hi> and do what ever
you do with their concurrence? Do not you
make them <hi>Hewers</hi> of Wood, and <hi>Drawers</hi> of
Water, cause them to attend on every vain and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:52743:44"/>
frivolous undertaking, and prostitute them to the
very <hi>Dunghils?</hi> Nay, do you not <hi>vex</hi> and <hi>grieve</hi>
them with anxious and thorny Cares, about the
<hi>poorest</hi> and <hi>basest</hi> matters, insomuch that you
sometimes make them weary of their Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and long to be divorced from them? And
will you thus employ your Heaven-born <hi>Souls,</hi>
innobled with such <hi>rare</hi> and <hi>excellent</hi> faculties in
things of this nature, and yet think them too
good to be employed in the service of God,
wherein the glorious Angels themselves so much
delight? What's this but most wretchedly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>base
your selves, and provoke God that gave
you your <hi>Souls,</hi> to tear them away from you?</p>
            <p>5. Whether would you not have God to let
you have his heart in all that he does for you?
When he bestows upon you <hi>Corn,</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> and
such-like benefits, would you not that he should
do it with his Heart, without designs of <hi>dereli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
or <hi>obduration?</hi> Would you be content that
whiles he stretches forth his <hi>hand</hi> of bounty, and
fills your <hi>mouths</hi> with his <hi>outward</hi> blessings, he
should in the mean time with-hold his <hi>heart</hi> from
you?<note place="margin">Gen. 4. 14.</note> Alas, what did it avail <hi>Cain</hi> to be <hi>Adam</hi>'s
first-born, and Heir of all the World, when God
would not <hi>own</hi> him? Or what did it avail <hi>Esau</hi>
to be the first born of the wealthy <hi>Isaac,</hi> and
elder Brother to the Princely <hi>Jacob,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 16. 13</note> when the
Lord hates him? Upon these and such-like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiderations,
I cannot but think but you would
have God, whatever he does for you, to let you
have his heart with it. Every good man saith,
Lord, whatever thou dost for me, let me have thy
<hi>heart</hi> with it: Though thou <hi>give me the Bread of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:52743:44"/>
Adversity, and the Water of Affliction,</hi> yet let
me have thy <hi>heart</hi> with it: Though I have never
so little from thee, let me have thy <hi>heart</hi> in it.
Now what you would that <hi>God</hi> should do to you,
<hi>the same do ye to him.</hi> If ye would that he
should let you have his heart in what he does for
you, let him have <hi>yours,</hi> in what you do for
him.</p>
            <p>6. Whether would you not have your ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<hi>accepted</hi> of <hi>God?</hi> If you would not, what do
you <hi>tender</hi> it for? Do you think it worth the
while to <hi>mock</hi> him, or that you may do it with
<hi>safety:</hi> If you would have your service <hi>accepted,</hi>
then ingage your hearts in it: for, assure your
selves, do what you will, all is in <hi>vain</hi> without
it. <hi>Simon Magus</hi> believed, was baptized, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
with <hi>Philip,</hi> and wondered at the Miracles
and Signs which were done; and what was he
the better for all this?<note place="margin">Act. 8. 21.</note> 
               <hi>Thou hast neither part nor
lot</hi> (saith Peter) <hi>in this matter; for thy heart is
not right in the sight of God:</hi> Observe here how
far this man went; he acknowledged the truth
of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> received the Seal of the <hi>Covenant,</hi>
associates himself with the Servants of <hi>Christ,</hi>
(which others were afraid to do) is affected with
their <hi>wonders,</hi> desires <hi>ability</hi> to do the like, and
that so earnestly that he offers <hi>money</hi> for it; but
his <hi>heart</hi> is not right, and that mars all. Had it
been <hi>right,</hi> though he had done <hi>less,</hi> it would
have been <hi>enough;</hi> but that being <hi>wrong,</hi> though
he did <hi>more,</hi> it was too <hi>little.</hi> Faith and Holiness
are so necessary to the acceptance both of our
Persons and Services, that without them all is in
vain. Herein the Scripture is most plain: For
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:52743:45"/>
one and the same Apostle shews that without
the former it is <hi>impossible to please God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 6. 12. 14.</note> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the latter it is impossible to <hi>see</hi> him. Now
this being so, be sure when ever you present your
selves before the Lord, to have your <hi>hearts</hi> and
<hi>affections</hi> with you, and engage them in his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 58.</note>
and then <hi>your labour shall not be in vain in
the Lord,</hi> as the labour of Hypocrites, and all
such <hi>painted Sepulchres,</hi> is; but then you shall
<hi>make your way prosperous,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Josh. 1. 8.</note> 
               <hi>and then you shall have
good success.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Let's worship God in <hi>Truth.</hi> Whiles <hi>Jews,
Pagans,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Optarim omnia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam <hi>simplicissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mè fieri, &amp;c.</hi> P. Martyr, Ep. Amico cuid. in Angl. p. 1127. Col. 2. 8.</note> and such as symbolize with them, do
contrary to his Command, worship him in the
use of <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> let us in obedience
to it, worship him in <hi>truth.</hi> Let's <hi>beware lest
any man spoil us through Philosophy and vain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
after the Tradition of men, after the Rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the World, and not after Christ.</hi> The
Jewish <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> which we are mainly to look
after, as having been once of Divine Institution,
were crucified (as you have already heard) with
Christ, and died with him; and the Christian
Church did after a time decently (as it were) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terr
them, and lay them in their grave; and let
not us now offer to dig them up again. This in
<hi>Augustines</hi> account were no less than <hi>to offer vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
to the Diceased;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Non esset pius funeris deductor sed impius sepulturae violator. <hi>Ep. 119.</hi>
               </note> than which, what can be
more inhumane and barbarous? Though there
was a time when they were <hi>salutaria exercitia,</hi>
wholsome and useful Rudiments, yet now its not
so; now they are no better than <hi>foetida cada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vera,</hi>
filthy Carcases; fitter with those menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
by the Prophet,<note place="margin">Isa. 65. 4.</note> to <hi>remain among the graves,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:52743:45"/>
and lodge in the monuments,</hi> than abide among
the living; and therefore let's not own them, or
have any thing to do with them. God ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the <hi>Levitical</hi> Law (which was the Jews
<hi>Ritual</hi>) that if any man touched a <hi>dead</hi> Body,<note place="margin">Numb. 19. 16.</note>
he should be unclean. If then their <hi>Ceremonies</hi>
are dead, let's beware of touching them, lest we
become <hi>unclean.</hi> And as for other Ceremonies,
which are of latter date, and humane instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
let's take heed likewise how we own them,
or have any thing to do with them. I may say of
the one sort and the other, as <hi>Solomon</hi> did in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
case,<note place="margin">Pro. 20. 10</note> 
               <hi>Both of them are alike Abomination to
the Lord.</hi> The former once were lawful, but
now are unlawful; the latter never were lawful,
nor ever will be lawful; and therefore as we
desire to keep our selves <hi>pure,</hi> let's abstain from
both of them, and utterly renounce and disclaim
them.</p>
            <p>Now that I may the better hold forth to you
the necessity of worshipping God in <hi>Truth,</hi> and
the unwarrantableness of worshipping him in
the use of <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> I shall offer to you these
following <hi>Queries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Whether is there so much as one <hi>word</hi> or
<hi>syllable</hi> in all the holy Scriptures for any such
kind of <hi>Worship?</hi> If you are <hi>Christians,</hi> you
take the Writings of the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apostles</hi>
for the Word of God; and if you are <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,</hi>
you take them for a compleat and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<hi>Rule</hi> of Divine and Religious Worship.
The Holy Ghost hath there declared both to
<hi>whom</hi> such kind of Worship belongs, and the
<hi>manner</hi> wherein it is to be performed. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:52743:46"/>
you will act regularly, and do nothing but
what is just and warrantable, shew us by what
<hi>Prophet</hi> or <hi>Apostle</hi> he hath allowed you to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
in the use of <hi>Ceremonies.</hi> In the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
he foretells the <hi>abolishing</hi> and <hi>ceasing</hi> of
Them.<note place="margin">Dan. 9. 27. Cant. 2. 17.</note> The Church of those times being afflicted
with the burden of them, <hi>prayes</hi> for support till
the time of their <hi>ceasing</hi> should come. Christ
no sooner sets upon preaching,<note place="margin">Mat. 11. 28 15. 3.</note> but he invites
People from them, <hi>justifies</hi> them in the refusal of
them; and afterwards laying down his Life to
<hi>redeem</hi> them from them,<note place="margin">Col. 2. 14.</note> 
               <hi>he blots out the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing
of Ordinances that was against them, takes
it out of the way, and nails it to his cross.</hi> The
Apostles,<note place="margin">Act. 15. 28.</note> Elders and Brethren <hi>at Jerusalem,</hi> dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by the Holy Ghost, who sat <hi>President</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them, decreed against them. And as if
all this were too little, <hi>Paul</hi> who had once such
esteem and <hi>Zeal</hi> for the <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Traditions</hi> of
his Fathers, speaks of them with words of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
<hi>contempt</hi> and <hi>indignation;</hi> calls them all to
nought,<note place="margin">Heb. 9. 10.</note> terms them <hi>carnal Ordinances, Rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the World,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Col. 1. 8.</note> 
               <hi>beggarly Elements,</hi> and the
like.<note place="margin">Gal. 4 9.</note> Thus I have shewed you that both Prophets
and Apostles speak much against Ceremonies, do
you now shew where they speak any thing for
them.</p>
            <p>2. Whether if the holy Scriptures have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all for them, is it not apparent <hi>supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
to institute them, or worship God in the use
of them? If <hi>Tertullian</hi> be not mistaken, it is:
<hi>Those Ceremonies</hi> (saith he) <hi>are vain, which
are used without any Authority of Divine or
Apostolical Command, and are to be accounted
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:52743:46"/>
superstitious; and even therefore to be repressed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sed quoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am unum aliquod at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigimus va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuae obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, non pigebit catera quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare quibus meritò va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitas ex probranda, siquidem si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne ullius aut Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nici, aut Apostolici praecepti auctoritate fiunt. Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jusmodi enim non religioni sed super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitioni de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putantur, <hi>&amp;c. De Orar. cap. 12. p. 23. Ed. Pam.</hi> Superstitio vitium est Religioni appositum secundum exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum, <hi>&amp;c. 22. q. 92. a. 1. c. Acts 17. 22. Mark. 7. 5, 6, 7. Col. 2. 20. Gal. 4. 10.</hi>
               </note>
               <hi>because they make us in some sort like the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</hi>
And if <hi>Zanchy, Vrsin, Viret</hi> with other
Orthodox and learned writers on the <hi>second</hi>
commandment, are not mistaken, it clearly falls
within the compass of it. Nay, if the very
descriptions that the schoolmen give of <hi>super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition</hi>
may pass, it stands justly chargeable with
it. <hi>Aquinas</hi> places it in the <hi>excess</hi> of religion,
as when a man gives divine worship either <hi>to
him,</hi> it belongs not to, or in that <hi>way,</hi> it ought
not to be given. And speaking of <hi>four</hi> kinds of
superstition, he places the <hi>first</hi> in the giving of
worship to the true God, <hi>modo tamen indebito,
but after an undue manner.</hi> It consists not only
in the worshipping of a <hi>strange</hi> deity, but in
the worshipping of the <hi>true</hi> Deity in a strange
manner, such as he hath not appointed. He that
adds institutions to his institutions, nay so much
as a ceremony to the ceremonies, he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
is guilty of it. And therefore as the
<hi>Athenians</hi> were guilty of it in their ignorant
worsh<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pping of their <hi>unknown God,</hi> so likewise
were some both of the ancient <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians;</hi>
the <hi>former</hi> in their <hi>washing</hi> of hands
before meat; the <hi>latter</hi> in their <hi>abstaining</hi> from
certain meats, and <hi>observing</hi> of <hi>dayes.</hi> And
what a great sin it is to be guilty of it, we may
gather from Gods proceedings against <hi>Saul</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his miscarriage in the <hi>business</hi> of the <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>llkites.</hi>
For the injury they offered to the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:52743:47"/>
               <hi>Israelites</hi> when they came from <hi>Egypt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 15. 3.</note> the
Lord appoints <hi>Saul</hi> to go and destroy them,
both <hi>man</hi> and <hi>woman, infant</hi> and <hi>suckling, ox</hi>
and <hi>sheep, camell</hi> and <hi>ass.</hi> And he accordingly
went against them and smote them, but did not
<hi>fully</hi> observe his commission; for, to say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of other things, he spared the <hi>best</hi> of the
<hi>sheep,</hi> and of the <hi>oxen,</hi> and of the <hi>fatlings,</hi>
and the <hi>lambs,</hi> and all that was good. And
this he did (if he himself say true, and we
do not find that <hi>Samuel</hi> charges him with
falshood in it) that he might <hi>sacrifice</hi> them to
the Lord in <hi>Gilgal. Saul</hi> then, out of a <hi>super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious</hi>
humour would offer that to God
which he would not have offered to him. And
whats the issue of it? why, he is so incensed
against him for it, that he takes him and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vests
him of his <hi>royal</hi> ornaments, deposes him
from being <hi>King,</hi> and casts him out of his <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour</hi>
for ever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saul</hi> committed several miscarriages before,
but God was not so displeased with any of them
as he was with this. We do not find that he
ever smiled upon him, or owned him after this
time. Now if it be <hi>superstition,</hi> to do that in
the worship of God that he hath not appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and such a dangerous thing to be guilty of
it, you had best consider before you go any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
whether you may either <hi>lawfully,</hi> or <hi>safely</hi>
use such Ceremonies in his worship as <hi>he</hi> hath
not appointed, but have been devised by
<hi>men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Whether should you not imitate the <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive</hi>
Church? If ever the Church were wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:52743:47"/>
of imitation,<note place="margin">Vid. Euseb. Hist. Eccl. l. 3. c. 32. gr.</note> it was during her <hi>primitive
state.</hi> Then, as <hi>Egesippus</hi> shews, she was a <hi>pure</hi>
and <hi>incorrupted</hi> Virgin. So she continued for
somewhat above an <hi>hundred</hi> years after our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours
time; so long she remained free from
those superstitions and errours that after, like a
mighty flood, brake in upon her. Now during
this space of her Virgin <hi>purity,</hi> whether had she
any of those Ceremonies that at this time are,
with so much heat, contended for, amongst
us? The learned <hi>Camero</hi> (to mention no
more) is peremptory in the negative.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Considere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus quaeso primitivam illam Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siam, &amp;c.</hi> De Eccl. Rom c. 10. p. 560.</note> 
               <hi>Besides</hi>
(saith he) <hi>water in baptism, bread and wine in
the Lords Supper, imposition of hands, and anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the sick, she had not any ceremonies at all.</hi>
Christians then contented themselves with the
institutions of Christ, and rejoiced in the liberty
wherewith he had set them free, without trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
themselves or others, with the devising
or imposing of any humane <hi>rites</hi> or <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Whether ought you not to maintain your
<hi>Christian liberty?</hi> you think you ought to
maintain your <hi>civil liberties,</hi> and will venture
at law all you have, before you will let them go:
and ought you not to make as great account of
your <hi>Christian,</hi> and <hi>spiritual</hi> liberty, as of your
<hi>civil?</hi> I am sure <hi>Paul</hi> did. Though he were a
man of a most peaceable, condescending spirit,
yet herein he was resolute.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 12.</note> 
               <hi>All things</hi> (saith
he) <hi>are lawfull to me, but I will not be brought
under the power of any.</hi> And the same path
he went in himself, the same he perswades
others to go. <hi>Be ye not</hi> (saith he) <hi>the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:52743:48"/>
of men.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 23.</note> When he speaks of <hi>civil</hi> mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
then he doth all he can to stir them up to
yielding and complying, labouring to prevent
law-suits and the evils that attend them.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 5, 6, 7.</note> 
               <hi>Is it
so</hi> (saith he) <hi>that there is not a wise man
amongst you, no not one that shall be able to
judge between his brethren? But brother goeth
to law with brother, and that before the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.
Now therefore there is utterly a fault
among you, because ye go to law one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
why do ye not rather take wrong? why do
ye not rather suffer your selves to be defrauded?</hi>
This is his language as to <hi>civil</hi> matters: therein
he uses all his art, and interest, to perswade
them to mutual submission and forbearance, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vising
them rather to recede from their own
rights, and suffer themselves to be <hi>defrauded,</hi>
than to ingage in vexatious law-suits, to the
dishonour of the Gospel. But when he comes
to speak of <hi>spiritual</hi> matters concerning their
Christian liberty, he discourses after another
manner. Therein he will have them to be sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast
and unmoveable, not inslaving themselves
to the wills of men, or becoming their servants.
What it is to be the servants of men <hi>Ambrose</hi>
tells us.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Servi ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum sunt, qui humanis se subjiciunt superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onibus.</hi> In 1 Cor. 7. 23.</note> 
               <hi>They are the servants of men</hi> (saith
he) <hi>that subject themselves to humane supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
Doubtless, as God will call you to an
account for his word and ordinances, so he will
for your <hi>Christian liberty,</hi> and therefore it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
you to take heed how you let it go.</p>
            <p>5. Whether should you not so far as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
you may hold <hi>communion</hi> with the best <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Churches?</hi> without question it is the will
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:52743:48"/>
of Christ, that you should so do. If there be one
Church more Orthodox and holy than another
you should endeavour <hi>communion</hi> with it. And
if so, how can you imagine it lawfull, to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
God in the use of those <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> which
the best <hi>reformed Churches</hi> have declared against
and abolished, as not only unnecessary and
burdensome, but superstitious and scandalous?

and utter renouncing of them (whereof
you may see plenty in others) <hi>Suartez</hi> menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

that it is unlawfull to worship God with any
other <hi>worship,</hi> than that which is commanded
in the <hi>Scriptures.</hi> And that you may not think
he speaks with reference only to the substance
of worship, hear what he saith in another place.
<hi>The hereticks</hi> (saith he) <hi>of our time, say that
every Ceremony, and every kind of worship that is
not commanded by God himself, or is not contained
in the Gospel, is superstition: yea, they call it
idolatry.</hi> And if the <hi>Protestant</hi> Churches pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
such doctrine, and act accordingly, and that
without sin, how can you without sin <hi>separate</hi>
from them? how will you free your selves
from the charge of <hi>schism,</hi> which is an evil so
much condemned by Christ, and prejudicial to
the honour and welfare of his Church?</p>
            <p>6. Whether leaving both the practice of the
<hi>primitive</hi> Christians, and the <hi>communion</hi> of the
best <hi>reformed</hi> Churches, and you lawfully go
and comply with <hi>Idolaters</hi> in the use of those
things, they have grosly <hi>abused</hi> in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane
mysteries? Herein the Scripture is very
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:52743:49"/>
plain.<note place="margin">Lev. 18. 3.</note> 
               <hi>After the doings</hi> (saith God) <hi>of the
land of Egypt wherein ye dwelt shall ye not do:
and after the doings of the land of Canaan whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I bring you, shall ye not do: neither shall
ye walk in their ordinances.</hi> And in another
place:<note place="margin">Deut. 12. 29, 30.</note> 
               <hi>When the Lord thy God shall cut of the
nations from before thee, whither thou goest to
possess them, and thou succeedest them, and dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest
in their land: take heed to thy self, that
thou be not snared by following them, after that
they be destroyed from before thee; and that thou
inquire not after their Gods saying how did these
Nations serve their Gods? even so will I do
likewise.</hi> As God would have us to stand in
a close <hi>union</hi> to him, and one another, so he
would have us to stand at the utmost <hi>distance</hi>
from idolaters. And upon this ground the <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients</hi>
declined the use of many things though
in themselves lawfull, because they were used
and <hi>abused</hi> by Idolaters. <hi>Tertullian</hi> would
not have his <hi>Christian</hi> souldier, to go with a
<hi>Lawrel</hi> upon his head, and that because the
<hi>heathens</hi> used to do so. And <hi>Bishop Jewel</hi> hath
several other instances of the same nature. And
ought not we in these dayes to detest <hi>idolatry</hi>
and avoid <hi>communion</hi> with such as are guilty of
it,<note place="margin">Defence of his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pol. part <hi>3. c.</hi> 5. <hi>div.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 346.</note> as well as the servants of God have done in
former dayes? Is it not as odious to him, and
ought it not to be resisted by us, as much <hi>now,</hi>
as ever? If therefore the <hi>ceremonies</hi> imposed
be such as had their birth amongst idolatrous
<hi>pagans,</hi> and other enemies to God and his
truth, and have been not only used, but noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
<hi>abused</hi> by them, how can you without
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:52743:49"/>
apparent guilt make use of them? And thus I
have given you the <hi>Quaere's,</hi> I thought good
to offer to you, both concerning the worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
of God meerly with the <hi>outward</hi> man, and
the worshipping of him in the use of <hi>ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies;</hi>
consider of them and deal faithfully.</p>
            <p>I shall now in the last place, acquaint you
with the common <hi>impediments</hi> of worshipping
God in <hi>spirit</hi> and in <hi>truth;</hi> and shew you
whence it is that men are so ganerally averse
to worship him that way. And in pursuance
of the method propounded to my self, I shall
<hi>first</hi> speak of those that concern the worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
of him in <hi>spirit;</hi> and they are these.</p>
            <p>1. Their <hi>misapprehensions</hi> of God, his nature,
essence, and will. I have told you already, that
God is a most <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>simple</hi> being, and would
have worship <hi>suitable</hi> thereunto; but men are
apt to think otherwise of him. They are apt
to think he is a being cloathed with such gross
<hi>matter</hi> as we poor mortals, that dwell in taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles
of clay, carry about with us, and that he
would have such kind of <hi>worship,</hi> and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
they give it to him.<note place="margin">Psal. 78. 41.</note> 
               <hi>They limit the
holy one of Israel;</hi> they measure him by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
his properties by theirs, and his will by
theirs, and think what pleases them, pleases
him.<note place="margin">Psal. 50. 21.</note> 
               <hi>Thou thoughest</hi> (saith God) <hi>that I
was altogether such an one as thy self.</hi> Now
this is a most unreasonable and unjustifiable
thing; for what proportion is there betwixt
that which is infinite, and that which is fiuite;
bewixt a most spiritual and simple being,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:52743:50"/>
and a soul attended with impotent and carnal
passions, and cloathed with gross and sinfull
matter, still drawing it to objects and pleasures
suitable to it self? none at all.<note place="margin">Isa. 55. 8, 9.</note> 
               <hi>My thoughts
are not your thoughts, neither are your wayes,
my wayes, saith the Lord. For as the Heavens
are higher than the earth, so are my wayes
higher than your wayes, and my thoughts than
your thoughts.</hi> If the thoughts and wayes of
a <hi>man</hi> are so far above the thoughts and wayes
of a <hi>beast,</hi> which yet is his fellow creature,
made of the same elements with him, how far
must the thoughts and wayes of <hi>God,</hi> needs be
above the thoughts and wayes of man? We
must not measure the <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>will</hi> of God
by ours (that's an unsafe way) but by what
he hath revealed of himself in his word, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
he hath made known both his <hi>nature</hi> and
<hi>will</hi> to us, and set down what he will have
us to do. And therefore since he hath therein
declared he will be worshipped in <hi>spirit,</hi> we
must without consulting with <hi>flesh</hi> and <hi>blood</hi>
worship him that way.</p>
            <p>2. The secret and close <hi>enmity</hi> that is in them
to all <hi>divine</hi> and <hi>spiritual</hi> matters. Though
they are indued with <hi>reasonable</hi> souls, and are
thereby capable of <hi>conversing</hi> with God, and
holding <hi>intercourse</hi> with Heaven, yet through
the miserable <hi>depravation</hi> that hath seifed upon
their <hi>natures,</hi> they are utterly averse to it, and
all <hi>spiritual</hi> services.<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 9.</note> 
               <hi>The carnal mind</hi> (saith
<hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>is enmity against God. Carnal</hi> men
have <hi>carnal</hi> minds, and are for <hi>carnal</hi> things,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:52743:50"/>
and have in them an <hi>enmity</hi> to <hi>God, Christ,</hi> and
all <hi>spiritual</hi> services. By how much any ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
is more <hi>spiritual,</hi> by so much they are the
more at <hi>enmity</hi> with it. They would rather be
dealing with <hi>carnal</hi> matters though never so
base, than things <hi>spiritual</hi> though never so
pretious and excellent. They would rather
with the filthy <hi>Swine,</hi> embrace a <hi>dunghill,</hi> than
with the glorious <hi>angels,</hi> hehold the face of
God. The <hi>reasonable</hi> soul, instead of exercising
its authority over the <hi>sensitive</hi> powers, and
holding them in subjection, do's captivate and
inslave it self to them. Instead of sublimating
and raising them up to high and eminent ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices,
it indulges them in their bruitish and
boundless extravagancies, to the utter indispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
both of it self and them to all <hi>spirituall</hi>
and holy undertakings. For the cure hereof,
we must pray hard to God that he would sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
this <hi>enmity</hi> of our souls, <hi>stir</hi> up the several
faculties thereof to the discharge of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
functions, and cause us to <hi>delight</hi> in his truth
and wayes.</p>
            <p>3. Their <hi>immersing</hi> and <hi>drowning</hi> their souls
in the though <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> cares of worldly matters.
The world hath ever since the transgression in
<hi>Eden,</hi> and the depravation of our natures there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
been an enemy to God and his kingdom.
It doth not only intice the hearts of the sons of
men from him, but doth utterly indispose them
for the right serving of him. They let out
their hearts so much upon it, are so far in love
with it, and so eager in the pursuit of it that
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:52743:51"/>
when they come to set upon the serving of him,
they cannot get them off it. They can no more
remove them, than they can remove mountains.
Or if they can go so far, as to hale them into
the presence of God, yet if Heaven it self lay
upon it, they cannot keep them one <hi>hour</hi> there.
when a man hath been all the <hi>week</hi> long busie
about the world, how unfit is he upon the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi>
day to do any thing for God? what a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of matters hath he then to review and
exercise his thoughts upon? He hath <hi>ground</hi>
which he hath purchased to view,<note place="margin">Luke 14. 18.</note> and <hi>oxen</hi>
which he hath bought to try, and multitudes of
other matters to look after. He can perhaps
make shift at the close of the week to loose his
<hi>hands</hi> from the world, but he cannot loose his
<hi>heart</hi> from it. They are easily taken off it, but
his heart is not so. That goes and takes a view
of all the <hi>ear</hi> hath heard, the <hi>tongue</hi> hath spoken,
and the <hi>hand</hi> hath done, and passes a judgement
upon them all, weighing how far they were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
to his credit, and advantage, and how far
not. And herein he is so intent that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
spare his <hi>heart</hi> one hour, no, nor one quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of an hour, for God. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> is so common
that there is not a man that deals much in the
World, but his <hi>heart</hi> will Eccho to what I say, and
readily assent to it. If therefore we would serve
God with our <hi>hearts,</hi> we must first disintangle
them from the world, keep them at a further
distance from it, and free them from that mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
vassalage and bondage, they daily (to the
unspeakable debasing of them) lye in, to it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:52743:51"/>
4. Their <hi>forgetting</hi> that Gods <hi>eye</hi> is upon
them, viewing and taking notice of all they
do. They look after the <hi>eyes</hi> of men, take
care to keep their miscarriages from being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
by them: and so secure their reputation
with them; and in the mean time, they forget
that there is an all seeing <hi>eye</hi> upon them, that
observes all the treacheries, backslidings, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drings
of their inconstant <hi>hearts,</hi> and weighs
<hi>every</hi> of their actions with all the circumstances
belonging to them, in a most righteous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring
ballance. And what greater folly can
there be than this? shall we stand in awe of
<hi>men,</hi> and not of <hi>God?</hi> shall we prefer their
esteem, and acceptance with them, before the
esteem of God, and acceptance with him? Is it
<hi>God</hi> that we are to serve, or <hi>men?</hi> Is it <hi>he</hi> that must
sit in judgement upon us or <hi>they?</hi> Is it <hi>he</hi> that
must reward us or <hi>they?</hi> If it be <hi>he</hi> that must do
it, then lets henceforth have respect to his <hi>eye,</hi>
and see that our services be pleasing to him, choose whether they please <hi>men</hi> or no.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 3.</note> 
               <hi>With me</hi>
(saith <hi>Paul) it is a very small thing that I should
be judged of you, or of mans judgement.</hi> Alas,
what will it avail us, to have <hi>them</hi> think well of
us, when <hi>he</hi> thinks ill? what will it profit us to
be acquitted by <hi>them,</hi> and condemned by <hi>him,</hi>
or to be owned by <hi>them</hi> and rejected by <hi>him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. Their <hi>security,</hi> and want of care, and
watchfulness over themselves. Though they
know their souls are treacherous and deceitful,
and that they are apt to backslide, and give
them the slip in the service of God, yet they
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:52743:52"/>
will not be got to watch over them, but set them
at liberty, letting them rove and wander up and
down whither they please. Though they know
they have deceived them a thousand times, to
the losing the benefit of many a pretious ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
and duty, whereby they might have been
edified and furthered in the way of God, yet
they still trust to them, letting them take their
liberty and do what ever they please. Now this
is a very unwise course, and can lead to nothing
but destruction and ruine. We must remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
what kind of souls we have; they are not
<hi>innocent</hi> but <hi>sinfull;</hi> not <hi>prone</hi> to holy under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings,
but greatly <hi>averse</hi> to them; not <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi>
but <hi>treacherous;</hi> and therefore, if we will
have them to ingage in the service of God, we
must watch over them, and look to them. When
ever we set upon duties, we must inquire after
them, call them home from their accustomed
wandrings: and when we have them, we must
mind them of what we are going about; and
with all the art, and skill we can, urge them
with the solemnness and importance of the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
giving them no rest untill we have brought
them into an awfull and holy frame, and fitted
them for the work of God. And when we have
ingaged them in the work, that we may the
better keep them to it, we must set a <hi>guard</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, and carefully watch all the back doors,
and secret passages, through which they use to
steal away from us. And when ever we see
them begin to stir, we must presently resist and
restrain them, accounting that which is done
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:52743:52"/>
without them, is <hi>vain,</hi> and to no purpose. As
Masters stand over their idle and unfaithful <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,</hi>
to keep them to their work, so must we
stand over our <hi>Souls,</hi> to keep them stedfast and
lively in the Duties we have in hand, that so we
may <hi>serve God acceptably, with reverence and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fear, because he is a consuming Fire.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 28, 29.</note>
            </p>
            <p>6. Their spiritual <hi>slothfulness</hi> and lothness to
take pains with their Souls. They are convinced
that they ought to worship God in <hi>spirit,</hi> and
that such kind of Worship is the likeliest to please
him; but rather than they'l be at the pains to
bring themselves to it, they'l let it alone, and
worship him that way that is less difficult, choose
whether it please him or no. They find that to
take their thoughts and affections off their usual
objects, gather them together, engage them in
the service of God, and there keep them close
to it, is a business that requires some <hi>pains;</hi>
which rather than they'l take, they'l come with
their Bodies alone into his presence, and present
them to him, leaving their <hi>Souls</hi> behind them,
as diligent in the pursuit of secular matters as
ever. Or if they do bring their <hi>Souls</hi> with
them, yet they do not <hi>keep</hi> them with them.
They have their company no longer than the
<hi>Servants</hi> that attend on them; they bring them
to their <hi>seats,</hi> and there leave them. For the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressing
of this Evil, we must call to mind the
equity and necessity of the <hi>Souls</hi> engaging and
concurring with us in the service of God; and
consider, that whatever we do without them
signifies just nothing. And hereupon we must
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:52743:53"/>
exercise all the Authority we have over them,
use all the Interest we have in them, follow them
from place to place, and not let them rest till we
have prevailed with them to accompany us into
his presence, and joyn with us in the several du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
we are to perform.</p>
            <p>Having thus spoken of the several <hi>Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
that concern the worshipping of God in
<hi>spirit,</hi> I shall <hi>now</hi> proceed to those that concern
the worshipping him in <hi>truth,</hi> and shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
conclude this present discourse.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Is Satan,</hi> who does all he can to keep men
from worshipping God in that <hi>simple, plain</hi> way
that he hath appointed; stirring them up to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
him in a <hi>ceremonious superstitious</hi> manner,
which he well knows will be so far from being
acceptable to God, or advantagious to them,
that it will rather draw down his wrath upon
them. He hath disobeyed God <hi>himself,</hi> and
would have <hi>them</hi> to do so too. He is become an
Enemy to God <hi>himself,</hi> and would have <hi>them</hi> to
be so likewise. He hath undone <hi>himself,</hi> and does
all he can to bring them into the same condition.
When we were <hi>in</hi> happiness, be never rested till
he had got us <hi>out</hi> of it, and now we are out of it,
he does all he can, to keep us <hi>from</hi> it. As it was he
that perswaded our first Parents to eat of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
fruit,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11. 3 1 Chron: 21. 1. Luk. 22. 3. Act. 5. 3. Mat. 13. 39 1 Thes. 2. 8 Ephes. 2 2.</note> so it was he that perswaded <hi>David</hi>
to number <hi>Israel, Judas,</hi> to betray <hi>Christ, Ananias</hi>
and <hi>Saphira,</hi> to lie to the <hi>holy Ghost.</hi> It was he
that sowed the <hi>tares</hi> among the <hi>Wheat,</hi> hindred
<hi>Paul</hi> from going to the <hi>Thessalonians;</hi> and it is
he that works in the <hi>Children</hi> of Disobedience.
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:52743:53"/>
He does all he can to draw men to down-right
<hi>Atheism;</hi> but if he cannot bring them to that,
he labours to draw them to <hi>idolatry</hi> and <hi>supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
If he can, he'll keep them from worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
God <hi>at all;</hi> but if he cannot prevail with
them to go so far, he then labours to keep them
from worshipping him after the <hi>right manner.</hi> If
he can, he'll keep them from doing <hi>so much</hi> as
<hi>God</hi> requires; but if he cannot perswade
them to that, he then labours to draw them <hi>to
more.</hi> If he can, he'll perswade them to deny the
<hi>authority</hi> and <hi>truth of the Scriptures;</hi> but if he
cannot get them to that, he'll urge them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
their <hi>sufficiency and perfection;</hi> and hereby he
makes way for the bringing in of <hi>humane Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Traditions, Ceremonies,</hi> and any thing that
<hi>superstitious</hi> heads have a mind of. <hi>Calvin</hi> lays
it down as an undoubted truth,<note place="margin">Verum qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem est ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus mali perpetrari quò non eos incitet Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan.</note> That there is not
<hi>any</hi> evil perpetrated by men, to which they are
not incited by <hi>Satan.</hi> And he himself confesses
that he goes <hi>to and fro in the earth, and walks up
and down in it.</hi> And for what end does he this?
Not to take the <hi>air,</hi> for he needs it not; or if he
did, he might do it in a narrower compass; nor
to <hi>acquaint</hi> himself with the World,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>In</hi> Joh. 13. 2.</note> for he knows
it well enough already;<note place="margin">Job 1. 7. 1 Pet. 5. 8.</note> but he does it for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
end, and that is, as the Apostle shews, <hi>to seek</hi>
out <hi>whom he may devour:</hi> and herein he is so dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
and unwearied, that he <hi>compasses Sea and
Land to make one Proselyte.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 23. 15</note> And that he may
the better carry on this his <hi>infernal</hi> design, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
the several <hi>Constitutions, Dispositions,</hi> and
<hi>Interests</hi> of men, and accordingly lays his <hi>baits</hi>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:52743:54"/>
for them. One, he sees inclined to Unbelief and
<hi>Atheism,</hi> and tempts him to that; another, to
<hi>Profaneness</hi> and <hi>Debauchery,</hi> and tempts him to
that; another, to <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Superstition,</hi> and
tempts him to that. The <hi>Jews</hi> were a People ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
addicted to <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Superstition,</hi> and
he being aware of it, lays hold on all opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and means to provoke them to it. Hence
we find that when <hi>Moses</hi> was dead, and God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<hi>Michael</hi> the <hi>Archangel</hi> to take his <hi>Body</hi>
and bury it in some <hi>secret</hi> place, out of the way,
<hi>Satan</hi> stands up, and resists him. He well knew
that if the <hi>Israelites</hi> had but known where the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi>
of so great a <hi>Prophet</hi> had sain, they would with
little ado have been drawn to <hi>worship it;</hi> and
therefore when he saw the <hi>Angel</hi> going to interr
it, and lay it out of the way, he withstands him,
and disputes with him. The one was not more
forward to <hi>suppress</hi> and <hi>prevent</hi> an occasion of
Idolatry, than the other was to <hi>promote</hi> and <hi>fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
it. The Book called <hi>Petoreth Mosche,</hi> or <hi>The
passage of Moses out of this Life,</hi> describes this
strife which was betwixt them. Whether the
Book be <hi>Apocryphal</hi> or no, I leave to others to
judge; but the thing it self is not, for the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
<hi>Jude</hi> mentions it.<note place="margin">Jude 9.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The Scripture in like manner tells us that both
<hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> sacrificed to <hi>Devils:</hi> And who
stirred them up to such kind of wild <hi>Sacrifice,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 106. 37.</note>
but the <hi>Devil?</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 20.</note> Men would never be transported
with such <hi>inhumane fury,</hi> and <hi>barbarous Devotion</hi>
as to cut and lance themselves, and sacrifice their
Sons and Daughters, did not <hi>Satan,</hi> who reigns
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:52743:54"/>
in their hearts, and keeps under those Principles
of Nature that are in them, provoke them to it.
What work he makes among the poor <hi>Indians,</hi>
and what stratagems and devices he uses, that he
may draw those poor ignorant <hi>Souls</hi> to worship
him as God, and prevail with them to give to
him that honour that belongs to God, and
what it is that puts him upon it, with other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of that nature,<note place="margin">Hist. Ind. l. 5. c. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Acosta</hi> and others shew.
And the time was, when he carried on his work
in these Nations with a full career, prevailing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all to yield homage to him. And though upon
the breaking forth of the Gospel (of the <hi>sound</hi>
whereof he was impatient) he removed his
<hi>Court,</hi> and betook himself into the barbarous
<hi>Nations,</hi> where he might manage his Affairs
with less contradiction and more security, yet
he hath not altogether left us. Though he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
not so openly as in times past, nor so <hi>auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously</hi>
as to solicite to the plain worshipping of
<hi>Idols;</hi> yet he is still, though more privately, and
in a way less liable to suspition, carrying on his
design amongst us. Some, he draws to <hi>Profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
others to <hi>Superstition;</hi> some to contemn <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,</hi>
others to <hi>corrupt</hi> them. If he can, he
keeps men <hi>from</hi> the House of God, but if he
cannot do that, he follows them <hi>thither,</hi> and
there makes them either <hi>careless</hi> or <hi>supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious.</hi>
When therefore we find our selves <hi>averse</hi>
to worship God in that <hi>plain, simple</hi> manner he
hath required, and carried forth with a desire of
humane <hi>Ceremonies</hi> and <hi>Inventions,</hi> let's suspect
<hi>Satan</hi> is dealing with us. When it is once come
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:52743:55"/>
to this, That we prefer two or three <hi>humane,
needless, indifferent</hi> Ceremonies, attended with
such circumstances as render them loathsome,
before the <hi>Peace</hi> of the Church, <hi>Preaching</hi> of the
Word, and <hi>Saving</hi> of Souls, we may well fear
he is at work in us. He is an invisible <hi>Agent,</hi> a
secret <hi>Promoter,</hi> one that plays in the <hi>dark;</hi> and
therefore though we see no external appearance,
yet let's not upon that account, conclude our
selves free from him. He may be busie at work
<hi>within</hi> us, when we think he is far enough
<hi>from</hi> us.</p>
            <p>2. Is <hi>Sensuality,</hi> or an inordinate affecting of
sensual things, or an over-readiness to gratifie
humour, and please the senses. There is scarcely
any thing that does render a man more averse
to worship God in <hi>simplicity,</hi> and carry him
away after an <hi>external, pompous, ceremonious</hi> Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
than <hi>sensuallity,</hi> or an affecting of <hi>sensual</hi>
things. By how much any man is more sensual,
by so much he is the more for a <hi>ceremonious</hi>
Worship. And so on the other hand, by how
much any man is more <hi>spiritual,</hi> by so much he
is the more for a <hi>spiritual,</hi> simple Worship. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that of the Apostle, <hi>They that are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Flesh, do mind the things of the Flesh; but
they that are after the Spirit, the things of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 5.</note>
The <hi>Israelites</hi> were a <hi>carnal, sensual</hi> People,
and what was the issue of it? Why, they must
have such <hi>gods</hi> as they might <hi>see</hi> going <hi>before</hi>
them.<note place="margin">Exod 32. 1</note> They had a God <hi>before,</hi> and one that had
done great things, insomuch that one would
have thought that if ever People were contented
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:52743:55"/>
and pleased with a God, they should have been
contented and pleased with him. But here was
the ground of their dislike, that he was a <hi>Spirit,</hi>
and therefore being weary of him, they call to
<hi>Aaron</hi> to make them other kind of Gods, even
such as they might <hi>behold</hi> with their <hi>Eyes,</hi> and
<hi>see</hi> going <hi>before</hi> them: Not that they thought a
<hi>God</hi> could be made, or that <hi>Aaron</hi> could do it,
or that that <hi>Calf</hi> which he made, was the <hi>God</hi>
that brought them up out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> but they
would have some visible <hi>representation</hi> and <hi>simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi>
of that <hi>God,</hi> which they might see, and do
worship to him by. As Children delight in <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies</hi>

            <p>3. Is <hi>prejudice,</hi> or a precipitant, preposterous

and then will not endure to <hi>hear</hi> it. They
either upon <hi>no</hi> grounds at all, or else such as
are very <hi>light</hi> and unwarrantable take up a <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice</hi>
and disaffection to it, and then they are

though men, if they will but look with Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-eyes,
cannot but see this worshipping
God in <hi>truth</hi> is of <hi>divine</hi> institution, yet many
of them having someway, or other taken up a
<hi>prejudice</hi> against it, they do not only refuse to
close with it, but <hi>hate</hi> and <hi>persecute</hi> it.</p>
            <p>Now the grounds on which they proceed, and
build their <hi>prejudice</hi> are commonly such as
these.<note place="margin">Mark. 1. 27.</note>
            </p>
            <p>1. They think worshipping God in <hi>truth,</hi>
is but a <hi>new</hi> kind of worship,<note place="margin">Act. 17. 19. Ethnici spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie novita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis primos Christianos in odium adducebant &amp; antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis suae monumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta, non superbè mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus quam falsò osten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabant. <hi>De Prejud.

invented the other day, destitute of that
antiquity, that <hi>ceremonious</hi> worship is attended
with. It hath been an usual thing for the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of the truth, to charge it with <hi>Novelty.</hi>
The <hi>Jews</hi> charged the doctrine of <hi>Christ;</hi> and
the <hi>Athenians,</hi> the doctrine of <hi>Paul</hi> with it.
And <hi>Camero</hi> tells us out of <hi>Symmachus</hi> that the
<hi>heathens</hi> objected it against the <hi>primitive</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
accounting their <hi>religion</hi> as no better
than a meer <hi>innovation,</hi> and thereupon insulted
over them. But we must not look upon every
thing <hi>new,</hi> that every one takes to be so. The
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:52743:57"/>
Scriptures contain not only the ancient <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons</hi>
but the ancient <hi>records</hi> of the Church;
and if we search them we shall find that
though a <hi>ceremonious</hi> worship was in the
Church for some ages, yet it was not so
<hi>from the beginning.</hi> When we would know
the ancientness of the priviledges of a <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>
or any other <hi>society,</hi> we presently run
<hi>ad fundationis tabulas,</hi> to the <hi>records</hi> or wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
wherein those priviledges are set down.
And so we are to do in this case; If we
would know the ancrentness of this worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
God in <hi>truth,</hi> we must go to the holy
<hi>Scripture,</hi> and there we shall find an account
of it. It will tell us, it is <hi>ancienter</hi> than any
kind of worship whatsoever. Perhaps, you
think it is a <hi>new</hi> kind of worship invented by
a company of precise persons addicted to <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity</hi>
and <hi>novelty</hi> in these <hi>late</hi> times, but
herein you are much mistaken; For, it is
not only the worship instituted by <hi>Christ</hi>
himself, and practised by the <hi>primitive</hi> Church
but the worship that was used (as you have
heard before out of <hi>Eusebius</hi>) by <hi>Melchise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deck.
Noah, Enoch,</hi> and other ancient <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs</hi>
that lived in the beginning of the world,
and served God acceptably without any of
those <hi>ceremonies</hi> that so many in these dayes
keep such a stir about.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>See Dr.</hi> Sam. Bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton <hi>fully on this in his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignment of Errours. p.</hi> 145.</note> We shall desire no
more for the determining of the present
controversie, but that we may go back to
the <hi>beginning,</hi> and try our worship by the
ancientest Churches, both of the <hi>Old</hi> and
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:52743:58"/>
               <hi>New-Testament.</hi> If we do not make it to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
that this kind of worship was used by
<hi>both</hi> of them, and that <hi>before</hi> any other, we
will never plead for it more.</p>
            <p>2. They alledge that they are <hi>unaccustom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
to it: They say it is such a kind of worship
as neither they nor their fathers have been
used to, and this they look upon as matter
of just exception. Their fathers have served
God in a <hi>ceremonious</hi> way, and <hi>they</hi> hitherto
have done so too and therefore think it
is not fit now to change. Though <hi>customes</hi>
are never so bad, yet when men have once
used themselves to them, they know not how
to leave them. According to that of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Jer.</hi> 13. 23. Vincere consuetudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem dura est pugna. <hi>Aug.</hi> in <hi>Psalm</hi> 30.</note>
               <hi>can the Ethiopian change his skin, or
the Leopard his spots, then may ye do good; that
are accustomed to do evil.</hi> Its a very hard
thing for men to leave those wayes that they
were born and brought up in, and that they
have been accustomed to. This is it that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<hi>Jews</hi> from turning <hi>Christians, Papists</hi>
from turning <hi>Protestants,</hi> and many <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants</hi>
from that purity they should, and
otherwise might attain to. Amongst other
articles that the <hi>Jews</hi> put in against <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan</hi>
and <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 6. 14. 21. 21.</note> this was one, that they
<hi>preached against their customes.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 4. 20.</note> And this
very thing the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> urges to
our Saviour; <hi>Our Fathers</hi> (saith she) <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped
in this mountain.</hi> And no doubt. it
was the common <hi>argument</hi> used by the <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans</hi>
against the <hi>Jews.</hi> By <hi>fathers,</hi> she
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:52743:58"/>
means not here <hi>immediate</hi> predecessors (that
had been a filly plea) but those ancient <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs
Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph</hi> and
others,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Montagu</hi> in his Acts and Mon. of the Church in the old t. <hi>c. 7. sect. 135. p.</hi> 469,</note> who (as some think) did at some
time or other, worship upon that hill; the
three first, when they sojourned in the land
of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and the last, when he went up
out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to bury his fathers body in the
Cave of <hi>Macpelah.</hi> Now the <hi>Samaritans</hi>
having this conceit in their heads, thought
(notwithstanding all that God had done
about his worship since the dayes of those
<hi>Patriarchs</hi>) that this was a sufficient proof
that <hi>Garizim</hi> was the place of worship. In
like manner <hi>Symmachus</hi> tells us, <hi>the faith of
so many ages is to be kept,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Symmach. <hi>Epist. l. 10. Ep.</hi> 54. August. <hi>Ep. 48. ad Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centium.</hi>

               <hi>and the Parents are

theirs.</hi> And the <hi>Donatists</hi> used the same plea;
<hi>its hard</hi> (say they) <hi>for us to leave the tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our Parents.</hi> Thus do many preferr
the occasional acts of some good men, and
customes taken up therefrom, before the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
institution of God in his word. For
the correcting of which errour, we must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that God made not the <hi>practices</hi> or
<hi>customes</hi> of men the rule of our proceedings
(he was so far from that,<note place="margin">Jer. 10. 3. Ezek. 20. 18.</note> that he <hi>every</hi> where
<hi>declares</hi> against them and <hi>diswades</hi> us from
them) but the holy <hi>Scriptures,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 4. 2, 3. Mat. 5. 21, 27, 33, 38, 43.</note> and with them
we must consult. And therefore we must take
our worship to them, and measure it by
them; if it be according to them we must
<hi>retain</hi> it though it seem never so <hi>new;</hi>
and if it be not according to them, we
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:52743:59"/>
must <hi>reject</hi> it, though it seem never so <hi>old.</hi>
If it be according to them, it is not want of
<hi>custome</hi> that can make it <hi>bad;</hi> and if it be not
according to them, it is not length of <hi>custome</hi>
that can make it <hi>good.</hi> And yet how few
amongst us can render any other reason for
the <hi>cermonies</hi> under dispute, but that <hi>learned</hi>
and <hi>holy</hi> men, martyrs and others that were
their ancestors used them before them? And
what a poor reason is this? Because men are
<hi>learned</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> are they therefore infallible!
Or because they might use <hi>ceremonies</hi> in their
times while the sun was low, and reformation
in the birth, may we do it in our times when
the sun is in its <hi>meridian</hi> height; and reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
out of those dangers of abortion, it la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
under before? Is it not reason that as
they resormed according to the <hi>light</hi> and <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages</hi>
of their times, we should also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
according to the <hi>light</hi> and <hi>advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages</hi>
of ours? Had those renowned wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies
that began the <hi>reformation,</hi> and sealed it
with their blood, argued as we do, and stuck
in the steps of their ancestors as we do in ours,
where had the <hi>reformation</hi> been? But we so
far weigh what they did <hi>not,</hi> that we forget
what they <hi>did.</hi> We urge what they <hi>retained,</hi>
not what they <hi>laid</hi> aside. The truth is, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
all the esteem and reverence we
pretend to have for them, we so far come
short of them, that I know not whether, they
are more to be admired for their <hi>zeal,</hi> or we
abhorred for our <hi>lukewarmness.</hi> God doth
not only look that we should know as <hi>much</hi>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:52743:59"/>
as our ancestors, but that we should know
<hi>more,</hi> not only that we should be as <hi>good</hi> as
they, but that we should be <hi>better.</hi> And
had we but followed their example, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
had been in greater <hi>glory,</hi> and the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God in another kind of <hi>dress</hi> than
now it is.</p>
            <p>3. They think its not so <hi>decent</hi> as a <hi>cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious</hi>
worship is. They say the worship of
God should be <hi>decent,</hi> but that this is <hi>unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.</hi>
One of them tells us, that <hi>without the
Ceremonies,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> in the life of Mr. <hi>Hooker. p</hi> 27.</note> 
               <hi>as a good face without hair en its
head, the reformed religion would have appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
bald, and uncomely.</hi> Belike then, religion
all along in our <hi>Saviours</hi> time and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
and those <hi>pure</hi> ages following, crowned
with so many glorious martyrs, was but as a
<hi>bald</hi> head, uncomely and illfavoured. And
yet if it were so, how as none of the <hi>burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
and <hi>shining</hi> lights of those ages, took no
notice of it? Comeliness was respected and
endeavoured then, as well as now: and yet
we read of no such <hi>observations</hi> and <hi>ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi>
so much as once used or named by them,
which by the men of this generation are look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon as the only <hi>ornaments</hi> of religion and
preservatives of <hi>comeliness.</hi> In consideration
whereof, I think I may upon good grounds,
say to them, as <hi>Paul</hi> to the men of <hi>Athens;
I perceive that in all things, ye are too super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious.</hi>
Its not the reformed religion (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comely,<note place="margin">Act. 17. 22.</note>

            <p>4. They think it's not so <hi>edifying</hi> as a <hi>cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious</hi>

excite to <hi>Devotion,</hi> so as a <hi>ceremonious</hi> Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
does. But did Christ judge it to be <hi>edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying,</hi>
and will men now come after him, and
say it is <hi>unedifying?</hi> Did not he know what
would tend most to the <hi>promoting</hi> of his own
Work, and the carrying on of his own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
and Interest? Will men be <hi>wiser</hi> than
Christ? Will they adventure to <hi>censure</hi> his
proceedings, <hi>examine</hi> his determinations, and
<hi>rectifie</hi> his appointments? Will they take upon
them to find <hi>fault</hi> with his Institutions, and
supply the defects of them with their own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions?

censure and find fault with the performances

but for a man to censure and find fault with

This no doubt would have been the language
of many amongst us, against this faithful ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
of God. But we must not measure the
proceedings of good men, by the foolish, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
judgements of carnal ones, who would
rather see the interest of God and his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
perish and come to nothing, than ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
themselves to the least hazard in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
it.</p>
            <p>To this example of <hi>Moses,</hi> we may add
that of <hi>Paul;</hi> What a <hi>peaceable</hi> man was
he? who ever loved <hi>peace</hi> more, desired it
more, preached it more, wrote for it more,
or endeavoured it more then he? yet would
not he <hi>give place to the false Apostles by sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
no, not for an hour.</hi> What,<note place="margin">Gal. 2. 5.</note> 
               <hi>not for an
hour?</hi> who in such a juncture of things
would not have born much longer? but he
would not do it: he would not <hi>lye for God,</hi>
or use any indirect, base means for the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
about of his design.</p>
            <p>And if we come to after-times, we find the
<hi>orthodox</hi> Christians carryed themselves after
the same manner. They would rather hazard all, then part with one <hi>syllable,</hi> nay one <hi>let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
of that name wherein the <hi>divinity</hi> and
<hi>honour</hi> of Christ was concerned. When the
<hi>Arrians</hi> desired them to admit one <hi>word,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Theodor. Hist. Eccl. l. 2. c. 18, 19<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note>
nay but one <hi>letter</hi> more into their <hi>Creed,</hi> that
is, to use <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, instead of <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
that if they would do it, they would be
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:52743:66"/>
at peace with them, yet they would not do it.
And we read likewise of <hi>Basil,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Id. l. 4. c. 17.</note> that when the
<hi>Prefect</hi> asked him for a time to obey, and not
suffer so many <hi>Churches</hi> to be troubled for a
<hi>small subtilty</hi> of opinions, he told him, that
those who are instructed in the holy <hi>oracles</hi>
are not suffered to alter one <hi>syllable</hi> of divine
determinations, but for them are to endure
(if called to it) all kinds of death.</p>
            <p>Nay we may learn this lesson from the very
enemies of the truth themselves. For, when
<hi>Cassander</hi> taught that Princes ought to find
out some way of <hi>peace</hi> betwixt the <hi>Catholicks,
Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calvinists,</hi> and in the mean time
to allow every one his own faith:<note place="margin">t. 2. <hi>de Laicis</hi> l. 3. c. 19.</note> 
               <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
was much displeased, and blamed him for it;
alleadging that the holy <hi>fathers</hi> taught we
must not only keep the articles of the <hi>Creed</hi>
inviolable, but all other <hi>dogmata fidei,</hi> or
points in religion, though they seem but
small. And,<note place="margin">See his Letter to <hi>Blackwell</hi> in K. <hi>James</hi> his works. <hi>p.</hi> 261.</note> writing to <hi>Blackwell, Arch-priest</hi>

you, those who say, they are but subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of opinions, that are contained in the Oath
that is offered to the Catholicks, and that you
are not to strive against the Kings authority
for such a little matter. But there are not
wanting also amongst you, holy men like unto
Basil</hi> the great, who will openly avow,
that the very least syllable of Gods divine
truth, is not to be corrupted though many
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:52743:66"/>
torments were to be endured, and death it self
set before you. Now if <hi>Papists</hi> thus stand so
much on their <hi>minuta dogmata,</hi> why should
not we? If they oppose the <hi>Cassandrian</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation,
its sure time for us to do it.
If they refuse to close with us because we
observe not the <hi>presumptions</hi> of men, we may

The <hi>young man</hi> our <hi>Saviour</hi> had to

made such a shew of respect to him, no soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
hears talk of parting with his <hi>estate</hi> for

Christ with so much seeming <hi>zeal,</hi> as if he
wanted nothing, but a little instruction to
make him perfect, and fit him for the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
of <hi>Heaven.</hi> He bears it out, as if he
had been ready to have laid himself, and all he
had down at the feet of Christ, but the issue
shews he meant no such thing; he no sooner
hears that he was like to cost him so dear,
but he presently turns his back upon him, and
leaves him. Like a young <hi>traveller</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:52743:67"/>
a voyage, he is confident at the first,

what dangers the angry visage of the boyling

presently falls, and he becomes another man.
Whiles our <hi>Saviour</hi> speaks to him of things

to Christ and his cause. Thus it hapned to
the <hi>Disciples;</hi> the <hi>swords</hi> and <hi>staves</hi> of the
multitude, frighted them away from Christ,

are of opinion, that they did not sin, in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking

<hi>Gerhard</hi> saith, this flight of theirs, was not a

it amongst their <hi>errours</hi> in <hi>manners.</hi> As for
the words alledged for their dismission,
though they <hi>obliged</hi> the Souldiers to let them

            <p>Summer <hi>birds,</hi> when Winter comes, hide

So long as the Sun shines on <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>

what kind of thoughts will those that are

a sin highly dishonourable to God, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial

back upon the sight of approaching <hi>troubles,</hi>
and refuse to suffer for him. He long ago laid

               <note place="margin">Jer. 9. 3.</note> Valiant, they were,
as any people in the World, but not for the
Truth. They were couragious for <hi>themselves,</hi>
but cowardly for <hi>God.</hi> And this was an aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of their Cowardize; for this shew'd it
proceeded not from any natural <hi>imbecillity</hi> of
the affections, but from want of true <hi>Piety,</hi>
which if they had had, they would have been
as valiant for him as they were for themselves.
And what by one Prophet he lays to the
charge of the <hi>Jews,</hi> he doth by another lay to
the charge of the <hi>Israelites; Ephraim</hi> (saith
he) <hi>is like a silly Dove without heart.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hos. 7. 11.</note> At other
times <hi>Ephraim</hi> had spirit enough, but when he
was to ingage for God, then he had no <hi>heart.</hi>
And thus it is with many amongst us: they
have heart enough for <hi>themselves,</hi> but none
for <hi>God.</hi> If they see their Names, Estates,
or carnal Interest, any way touched, they are
all on a <hi>fire,</hi> and ready to be burnt up with the
<hi>flames</hi> or their own <hi>zeal:</hi> but they can see
the Name, Truth, and Interest of God assault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and torn all to pieces, and never stir. In
their own matters, they are as if they were all
<hi>heart,</hi> but in the Cause of God, they are as if
(with <hi>Ephraim)</hi> they had no <hi>heart</hi> at all. Oh
it's sad that men should have an <hi>heart</hi> for
themselves, and none for God; that they
should have courage in their <hi>own</hi> Cause, and
none in his. This God takes unkindly, and will
severely punish.</p>

Though God call us sometimes to <hi>suffer</hi> for
him, yet we need not think much at it, for
he promises us ample <hi>recompence;</hi> he engages
that whatever we suffer for him in our Names,
Enjoyments, Relations, Friends, Liberty, or
any other thing, he will abundantly make us
amends. <hi>Verily</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>I say unto you,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 19. 28, 29.</note>
               <hi>That ye which have followed me in the Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
when the Son of man shall sit in the Throne
of his glory, ye shall sit upon twelve Thrones,
judging the twelve Tribes of Israel: And every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one
that hath forsaken Houses, or Brethren, or
Sisters, or Father, or Mother, or Wife, or
Children, or Lands, for my Names sake, shall
receive an hundred fold, and shall inherit ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Life.</hi> Suffering then, for Christ and
Religion, is rather a kind of <hi>gainful</hi> Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize,
than any real <hi>loss.</hi> Who ever counted it
loss, to part with a summ of money upon good
security, to receive it again at such a time
with due <hi>Interest?</hi> why, this is the Condition
of the Servants of God. He is so well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with their Sufferings, that he ingages to
make up whatever they lose upon his account.
He assures them that whatever they part with
for him, they shall have it repayed to them, an
<hi>hundred</hi> times over; and surely that's good <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest.</hi>
But yet, lest that should not be thought
enough, he tells them, that in the end they shall
inherit <hi>everlasting Life.</hi> And upon these and
such-like grounds, the Servants of God have
in all Ages stood up in the defence of <hi>Religion,</hi>
and his true Worship, notwithstanding all
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:52743:70"/>
the miseries they thereby rendred themselves
liable to suffer. Though the Enemies of God
and his Truth, inflicted on them the greatest
tortures, the Devil, with all his malice and
subtilty, could help them to invent, yet they
entertain'd them <hi>cheerfully,</hi> and endur'd them
<hi>patiently;</hi> and not only so, but rejoyced in
them, as <hi>Ensigns</hi> of highest honour, praising
God, that he would make use of them to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
for his Name, and bear witness to his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
Truth. Nay, sometimes they were
acted by such a spirit of heroick Zeal, that
they desired Sufferings, and put themselves
upon them. When the <hi>Prefect</hi> urged <hi>Basil</hi> to
comply with the <hi>Emperour,</hi> and threatned
him with death, if he denied:<note place="margin">Socrat. Eccles. Hist. l. 4. c. 26. gr.</note> he gave him
this resolute and stout answer, <hi>Thou threatnest
me with death</hi> (saith he) <hi>and I would it would
fall out so well on my side, that I might lay down
this carcase of mine in the Quarrel of Christ, and
in the defence of his Truth, who is my Head and
Captain.</hi> And when the <hi>Prefect</hi> pressed him
to remember himself, and obey the <hi>Emperour,</hi>
he rejecting all, told him,<note place="margin">Gaudco to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to corde mihi pro optima causâ in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferri mala, ne<expan>

himself unworthy of such a <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</hi>
To these, were it needful, I might add
the Examples of multitudes more of blessed
Saints, who cheerfully hazarded all for Christ
while they were on Earth, and now are recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

their Reward with him in Heaven: But
the case is so well known, that none except

            <p>Now things being thus, what shall we think

<hi>safety,</hi> their very Rule, aiming at it in

or <hi>part</hi> with it; either be of <hi>one</hi> way, or <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
so they may but sleep in a whole skin,
and preserve themselves from trouble. They
will dishonour <hi>God,</hi> venture their <hi>Souls,</hi> or do
any thing rather than expose themselves to
danger. If Providence call them to suffer for
the Truth, they'l find out an hundred un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard-of,
impertinent silly distinctions, but
they'l evade it. When ever their Souls
upon any Convictions begin to talk of Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
they presently take them &amp; <hi>rebuke</hi> them,
saying as <hi>Peter</hi> to Christ,<note place="margin">Mat. 16. 22.</note> 
               <hi>Be it far from thee,
this shal not be unto thee.</hi> Certainly such persons
as these are an offence to Christ, and savour
not the things that be of God, but the things
that be of Men.</p>
            <p>And thus I have shewed you, both the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments,</hi>
that hinder men from worshipping
God in <hi>Spirit,</hi> and those likewise, that hinder
them from worshipping him in <hi>Truth.</hi> Let us
now see how far we are concerned in them;
how far they, or any of them, stand in our
way, and accordingly let us get them remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:52743:71"/>
The worshipping of God in <hi>spirit</hi> and in
<hi>truth,</hi> is the Worship he would have; this he
will only <hi>accept</hi> of, and this he will only <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward:</hi>
and therefore let us be sure to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
him with this kind of Worship, not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
our selves by any endeavours, or means
whatsoever to be taken off it. It is but a
while, and <hi>Jesus</hi> Christ who instituted this
Worship, will come again and vindicate it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all that oppose it. It is but a while, and
he will come to his <hi>Temple,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 2. 15.</note> whip out the <hi>Buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>
and <hi>Sellers,</hi> and purge it from the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
and defilements, that cleave unto it. It
is but a while, and he will call all Nations
down into the Valley of <hi>Decision,</hi> and there
he will plead with the <hi>Troublers</hi> of his Church,
and such as have muddied the Waters of his
<hi>Sanctuary,</hi> and polluted those Silver Streams
with their sinful mixtures, and then it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
whether the outward <hi>ceremonious</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping
of God, or the worshipping of
him in <hi>spirit</hi> and in <hi>truth,</hi> be the true Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, lets keep close to <hi>God,</hi> stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
our <hi>duty,</hi> and both cheerfully and constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
(notwithstanding all the troubles we may
thereby expose our selves to) persist in the
<hi>performance</hi> of it. Though men frown upon
us, and threaten us with <hi>Censures, Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Banishment, Confiscation,</hi> and all the
evil humane might and cruelty can do us; yet
let's not be moved, but count our selves hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
we have an opportunity to do, or <hi>suffer</hi> any
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:52743:71"/>
thing whereby we may testifie our respect to
so good a cause. Whose is all we have but
Gods? and for what end did he put it into
our hands, but that we should lay it out for
him? As therefore the <hi>primitive</hi> Christians
<hi>sold their Lands and Houses, brought the prices
thereof, and laid them down at the Apostles feet;</hi>
So let us bring our Estates,<note place="margin">Act. 3. 35.</note> 
               <hi>Enjoyments, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
Lives,</hi> and all we have, and lay it down
at the feet of <hi>Christ,</hi> being willing to <hi>sacrifice</hi>
all, so we may but further his opposed
Interest, and bear witness to his despised
Truth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bucer</hi> in an Epistle to <hi>Calvin,</hi> tells him,<note place="margin">Supersint &amp; qui ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lint libenter redimere, vitâ suâ Reipublicae pristinam colendi Christi li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertatem. <hi>Ep. 96. p. (mihi)</hi> 203.</note> That
there were some that would willingly <hi>redeem</hi>
to the Commonwealth, the ancient <hi>liberty</hi> of
worshipping Christ with their <hi>very lives.</hi> True
<hi>Grace</hi> and Christian <hi>Zeal,</hi> are of an heroick na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
ready to endure any thing for Christ,
his Worship, and Truth. If therefore we will
evidence our Grace to be true, and our Zeal
to be Christian, we must be willing to suffer.
It is a vanity to think of passing to Heaven
without <hi>suffering;</hi> the Saints have hitherto
found the way thither paved with <hi>troubles,</hi>
and we may not think of finding it otherwise
now. <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great, as <hi>piously</hi> as <hi>wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily,</hi>
told <hi>Acesius</hi> the <hi>Novatian,</hi> that if he
would not take up with <hi>Persecution,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Socrat: Hist. Eccl. li. 1. c. 10. gr.</note> and such
like dealing, he must provide him a <hi>Ladder,</hi> and
climb <hi>alone</hi> to Heaven. Unless we will either
be content <hi>without</hi> Heaven, or find some <hi>other</hi>
way to it, than the Saints have yet found, we
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:52743:72"/>
must look for <hi>troubles.</hi> They have been found
in the way of Heaven hitherto, and so they
will be to the end of the World. If then, we
will go the way of Heaven, let's make account
to <hi>meet</hi> with them, and <hi>prepare</hi> for them; and
when they fall upon us, let us with all holy
<hi>submission,</hi> and Christian <hi>cheerfulness</hi> undergo
them. In a word, whatever comes of it, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Prosperity or Adversity, Liberty or
Bonds, Life or Death, since God hath made
it our <hi>Duty,</hi> let us make it our <hi>Practise,</hi> to
worship him in <hi>Spirit</hi> and in <hi>Truth.</hi>
