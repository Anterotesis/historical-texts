            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Court Barron.</p>
               <p>And thus you haue heard in briefe, the cauſes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
you are bound to come to this Léete and Court
Barron.</p>
               <p>Alſo to the entent that this your Oth which you haue
taken, may be the better knowne, I thinke it good by
your patience ſomewhat to ſay concerning the ſame.</p>
               <p>Firſt in ſwearing, thrée things chiefly ought to bée
conſidered: The firſt is, that you ſweare truely, that is,
you muſt ſeclude all fauour and affection to the parties,
not fearing the rich, nor pitying the poore, not conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the ſimplenes of any perſon, nor the ſmalnes of the
offence, but hauing the truth onely before your eyes,
for loue thereof ſay and ſpeake that which you knowe
to be true, and no further.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, you muſt ſweare in righteouſnes, that
is, for the very zeale and deſire you haue in the declaring
of the truth, for the executing of iuſtice, for the obſeruing
of couenants, honeſt promiſes, Statutes, lawes, &amp; good
Cuſtomes, and hauing a reſpect in doing and performing
theſe things, you doe that which is to the glorie of God,
the honor of the Quéene, the preſeruation of the people
and Common-weale: and this manner of ſwearing is
commanded of almightie God<note n="*" place="margin">Caput. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Deutronomie,</hi> ſaying:
<hi>Thou ſhalt feare the Lord thy God and ſerue him, &amp; ſhalt
ſweare by his name.</hi> That is, we muſt ſerue God onely,
feare him and confeſſe his holy name, which is done by
ſwearing lawfully. Swearing alſo in many other places
of Scripture is commanded, but the ſame conditionally,
which is, we muſt ſweare in truth, in iudgement, and in
righteouſnes, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, in ſwearing and taking an oth, you muſt doo
it with iudgement, not raſhly nor vnaduiſedly, but ſober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb facs="tcp:8792:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
conſidering what an Oth is: and to put you in minde
thereof, I will in fewe words declare what an Oth is.
An Oth is the calling or taking to witneſſe of God his
name, to confirme the truth of that we ſay. And S. <hi>Paul</hi>
ſayth,<note n="*" place="margin">Hebrues <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> verſ. 16. 1<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>An oth for confirmation is among men an end of
all ſtrife.</hi> For in doubtfull and obſcure matters, where
the knowledge of men faileth, we flye vnto God, that he
which is the onely truth, may giue teſtimonie vnto the
truth, and he which vſeth God for a witneſſe, doth alſo
call for reuenge of periurie at his hands, if he deceiue and
ſpeake not the truth: alſo in laying your hands vpon
the booke, you doe ſweare, truely to enquire and make a
true preſentment of thoſe things wherwith you be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
and not to let from ſaying the truth, and doing truly,
for fauour, feare, loue or malice of any perſon: you muſt
conſider that in the ſame booke is conteyned God his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting
truth and moſt holy word, whereby we haue
remiſſion and forgiuenes of our ſinnes and euerlaſting
life. Alſo in the Goſpell book is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tained God his plagues
and threats to obſtinate ſinners, periured men, falſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe-bearers,
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demners of innocent and guiltleſſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
ſo that if you willingly forſweare your ſelues, you
vtterly forſake God, his mercie and truth, the merites of
our Sauiour Chriſt, his natiuitie, life, paſſion, death, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
and aſcention, the ioyes of heauen and euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
life, betaking your ſelues to the diuell the author of
all lyes, periurie and deceit: and by forſwearing, and
forſaking the truth, you doe forſake Chriſt, the light and
truth it ſelfe. And although that periurie doe eſcape
ſometime vneſpied and vnpuniſhed, and be kept ſecrete
betwéene ſome of you and others, yet your hearts will
iudge and repute one an other falſe, and be ſuſpitious of
each others doings: but God being faithfull he will not
deny himſelfe, and therefore he will not ſuffer the profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of his name to be vnpuniſhed: alſo at the laſt day,
when the ſecrets of all mens hearts ſhall be opened, then
<pb facs="tcp:8792:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the truth and your owne conſciences ſhall accuſe you,
and Chriſt the righteous Iudge ſhall iuſtly condemne
you to euerlaſting death and damnation. For this ſinne
of periurie God by his<note n="*" place="margin">Malac. 3.</note> Prophet hath threatned to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh.
Wherefore let vs pray vnto God that we may vſe
ſuch othes as be godly &amp; lawfull, that is, that we ſweare
not raſhly, in trifles, or in matters of no waight, but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
it is néedfull and neceſſarie onely: alſo that we doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
the ende, that our othes may ſerue to the honour of
God, and to the boulting out and teſtifying of a trueth.
And thus hauing put you in minde of your dueties and
Othes, the which I truſt you will diligently weigh and
conſider in performing and doing the ſame, to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of your conſciences: I will procéed no further there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
but declare vnto you the Articles of your charge.</p>
