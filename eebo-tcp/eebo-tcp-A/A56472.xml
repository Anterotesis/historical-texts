            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="3">

               <p>SInce the writing of the precedent Epiſtle, Advertiſement is come, that Almighty God of his infinite Mercy hath delivered you at length (dear Catholics) from your old Perſecutor, and, as we hope, will alſo ſhortly from your Perſecution; His Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty be thanked everlaſtingly for the ſame. Here generally the applauſe is no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, than it was in old time among the Chriſtians, upon the entrance of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> into the Empire after <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> or of <hi>Jovinian</hi> after <hi>Julian.</hi> But the former Example ſeemeth more like, for that good <hi>Conſtantine</hi> was of a different Religion when he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, yet of ſingular hope to become ſuch as afterward he did, both in reſpect of his excellent Parts,<note place="margin">S. Paulin. ep. <hi>11.</hi> ad Severum.</note> and of his pious Mother St. <hi>Helena.</hi> The difference of the two Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers is, That the Empreſs <hi>Helena</hi> did aſſiſt her Son here upon Earth, as St. <hi>Paulinus</hi> writeth, <hi>towards the Truth and Piety of Religion;</hi> but Queen <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> being violently deprived of this Life, will do it (we truſt) by her Prayers in Heaven. The Compariſon alſo is not improper in this, for that perhaps this our new King is the firſt that hath been abſolutely Lord of the whole Iſland of <hi>Britanny</hi> (with the Parts annexed thereunto) ſince <hi>Conſtantine.</hi>

We know what Commendation a Heathen Author gave to <hi>Conſtantine</hi> while he was yet no Chriſtian; and this in public Audience, at the day of Marriage with the Daughter of <hi>Maximianus Herculeus,</hi> both the Emperours being preſent, and hearing him:<note place="margin">The moral ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> before he was a Chriſtian.</note> 
                  <hi>Neque enim</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Forma tantum in te Patris; ſed etiam Continentia, Fortitudo, Juſtitia, Prudentia, ſeſe votis gentium praeſentant;</hi> Not only the Form and Beauty of your Father <hi>(Conſtantius)</hi> doth appear in you; but alſo his Continency, his Fortitude, his Juſtice, his Wiſdom, do repreſent themſelves in you, according to the full deſire and wiſh of all Nations.<note place="margin">Euſeb. l. <hi>8.</hi> hiſt. c. <hi>26.</hi>
                  </note> Thus ſaid he of that <hi>Conſtantine:</hi> Whereupon <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſheweth, That the Chriſtians of that time conceived ſo great Love towards him, (tho' he were not yet a Chriſtian) as his Adverſary <hi>Maxentius</hi> hearing of his coming towards <hi>Rome,</hi> was glad to feign that himſelf would be a Chriſtian alſo, to retain ſomewhat thereby of their affections from <hi>Conſtantine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. We read of divers excellent Men in Chriſtian Religion, who were preſumed and foretold that they would be ſuch, before they were Chriſtians indeed; and this only upon the foreſight of their good Natures and vertuous Inclinations; as, St. <hi>Martyn,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards Biſhop of <hi>Tours;</hi> St. <hi>Nectarius,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Millain,</hi> and St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Hyppo:</hi> albeit of St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi>'s Converſion from the Hereſie of the <hi>Manichees</hi> to Catholic Religion, St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> added another Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture alſo, or rather Prophecy; to wit, that the Prayers and Tears of his good Mother St. <hi>Monica,</hi> could not ſuffer ſuch a Son to periſh. All which you ſee how far it maketh for Us, and for our Hope, of this ſecond <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> who wanted not alſo a holy Mother to Pray and ſhed Tears abundantly for him whil'ſt ſhe lived, that he might be ſuch as we moſt deſire now; whereof my ſelf amongſt others can be a true Witneſs, and this from her own teſtimony.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And for that I cannot perſuade my ſelf that ſo holy Endeavors of ſuch a Mother in ſuch a Cauſe, can be fruſtrate with Almighty God, I do not only hope well, but do attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute hereunto in great part the many Bleſſings that have fallen upon this King ever ſince; but principally His Majeſty's Preſervation and ſtrange Delivery from infinite Dangers,<note place="margin">The ſtrange de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances of His Majeſty from many perils.</note> and moſt imminent Perils, as all men know; ſo as neither <hi>Cyrus,</hi> nor <hi>Romulus,</hi> nor <hi>Moyſes</hi> himſelf, was more ſtrangely preſerved than this King hath been ſince his Infancy. And for that God doth never commonly work thoſe great Effects but to great Ends, you Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholics of <hi>England</hi> may with reaſon hope well thereof, eſpecially if any thing came by his ſaid good Mothers Interceſſion, who loved you all ſo dearly, as whatſoever ſhe asked at God's hands for the Life and Proſperity of her dear Son in this World, a great part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was meant (no doubt) for You, and your Good, if ever you came to be under his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as now God hath brought you.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Another effect of this holy Queens Prayers for her only Son, I hold to be that other Bleſſing before-mentioned of ſo many rare Parts diſcovered in His Majeſty's Perſon; which truly, tho' I have had ever in great eſteem upon the reports of other men, yet hath
<pb facs="tcp:104638:4"/>
the ſame been exceedingly increaſed upon the late reading of a Book, written (I ſuppoſe) ſome years agon by His Highneſs, but printed in <hi>London</hi> this very year, 1603.<note place="margin">The King's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Book entituled <hi>Baſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licon Doron.</hi>
                  </note> This Book is entituled in the Greek Tongue, <hi>Baſilicon Doron;</hi> to wit, A Kingly Gift ſent by His Majeſty unto the Prince, his eldeſt Son, (now alſo our Lord) being in truth a Golden Gift in reſpect of the excellent matter contained therein; and it diſcovereth ſo many rare Parts in the Writer, as may juſtly give all Catholics good hope to ſee one day that fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in His Majeſty which moſt they deſire. And would to God this ſingular Treatiſe had appeared earlier to the World.</p>
               <p n="6">6. For ſetting aſide one Point only therein handled, which is Religion, (wherein His Majeſty muſt needs ſpeak according to his Perſuaſion and Education in that behalf;) all other matters are ſuch, and ſo ſet down, as you will exceedingly delight therein, and profit alſo thereby, if you read with attention, and ponder all well; but eſpecially Three Points above other I noted, with no ſmall admiration to my ſelf, which I ſpeak in all ſincerity of truth, as in the ſight of Almighty God. The firſt is,<note place="margin">Three rare Points of His Majeſty's Book.</note> the great variety of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect Learning, in ſuch a Perſon, and ſo occupied otherwiſe, as His Majeſty is. Secondly, the great maturity of Judgment, in applying the ſame ſo fitly to the peculiar Affairs of <hi>Scotland.</hi> The third is, the fervent and extraordinary affection of Piety towards God and Godlineſs, uttered in ſo effectual words, and upon ſo good occaſions throughout the whole Book, as a man may eaſily ſee it cometh from the heart. And how highly this one Point of Piety is to be eſteemed in ſo High and Mighty a Prince, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in theſe our days, when Contentions in Religion have wrought ſo great coldneſs of Religious Piety in many Great Mens Hearts, every Wife and Pious Man will eaſily conſider.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But I will go no further in this matter, leſt I may ſeem to flatter, which I hate with my heart, and His Majeſty deteſteth the Vice moſt prudently and Chriſtianly in this his Book: Only I will add for our common comfort, That it ſeemeth impoſſible unto me, that ſuch a Wit, and ſo godly-affected a Mind, as God hath beſtowed upon His Majeſty, can be long detained with the vanity and inanity of Sects and Hereſies, where no Ground, no Head, no certain Principle, no ſure Rule or Method to try the Truth,<note place="margin">No reaſon to be yielded why a man ſhould be rather of one Sect than another.</note> no one Reaſon at all can be found, why a man ſhould rather be of one Sect than another; but only every ones own Will, and particular Judgment, grounded (as each one will pretend) upon the Scriptures, whereof yet himſelf only will be the Judge and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter. Which things being of themſelves moſt abſurd, in ſo weighty a Cauſe as Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is, that concerneth the Eternal Salvation of our Souls, it is to be hoped that His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, having the former two parts of Judgment and pious Affection in that Excellency as hath been ſaid, will eaſily come in time to diſcover the ſame, and therewithal the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſubſtantial Grounds and clear Demonſtrations for the Catholic Religion, whereunto this Treatiſe alſo of the firſt planting of Chriſtian Religion in our Country, may (in my Opinion) give no ſmall help and light, if it might pleaſe His Majeſty to beſtow the caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his eye upon the ſame.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Wherefore, to conclude this Addition to my former Letter, God having wrought ſo ſtrangely this Change, as here is reported, with ſo general Peace and Applauſe of the whole Realm, you are to expect at His Divine Majeſty's hands the Effects that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to his Fatherly Love and Care, ever hitherto ſhewed towards you. And as for the Perſon now advanced, I know moſt certainly, that there was never any doubt or dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference among you, but that ever you deſired his Advancement above all others, as the only Heir of that Renowned Mother, for whom your fervent Zeal is known to the World, and how much you have ſuffered by her Adverſaries for the ſame. Yet do I confeſs, that touching the diſpoſition of the Perſon for the Place, and manner of his Advancement, all zealous Catholics have both wiſhed and pray'd, that he might firſt be a Catholic, and then our King; this being our bounden Duty to wiſh, and his greateſt Good to be obtained for him. And to this end, and no other, I aſſure my ſelf, hath been directed whatſoever may have been ſaid, written, or done by any Catholic, which with ſome others might breed diſguſt.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Now, it hath not pleaſed Almighty God to give us our deſires in the order of our wiſhes, but firſt to make him our King,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>1</hi> Reg. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> and then to leave us in hope of the other at his due time. What ſhall we ſay in this and all the reſt, but, as <hi>Heli</hi> did, <hi>Dominus eſt, quod bonum eſt in oculis ſuis, faciat:</hi> He is Lord, let him do as he thinketh beſt? And with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, Humility, Longanimity, and Obedience, ſeek by continual Prayer to haſten that time of our full Joy by His Majeſty's Converſion, which we truſt in his everlaſting Wiſdom and infallible Providence is already determined to be <hi>ſuo tempore.</hi> And in the mean ſpace, ſeeing it is here reported, that Catholics, according to their Abilities, have ſhewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb facs="tcp:104638:5"/>
in every Country both ready and forward to advance His Majeſty's preſent Admiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Crown, I do not doubt but they ſhall find the Effects of his Clemency for their delivery out of ſuch Afflictions, Calamities and Oppreſſions, as lately they have ſuffered by the inſtigation principally of ſuch people, whoſe Manners are moſt excellently and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently deſcribed by His Majeſty in the ſecond Book of his worthy Treatiſe, as to himſelf well experienced.</p>
               <p n="10">10. And it is no ſmall comfort in this behalf to have a King of whom we may truly uſe the words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hab. <hi>5.</hi>
                  </note> which he ſpoke of Chriſt, <hi>Didicit ex eis quae paſſus eſt, &amp;c.</hi> He hath learned by that himſelf hath ſuffered by the ſame kind of Men. And truly, tho' in his own Perſon he cannot be ſaid (nor would perhaps) to have ſuffered properly for Catholic Religion, as You have done; yet if we reſpect his neareſt, either in Nature, Blood, or Affection, and their Number, Rank, and Quality, that among them have ſuffered for the ſame Cauſe, He may be ſaid to have ſuffered perchance far more than You; for that more of his Princely Blood hath been ſhed in <hi>England, France,</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> about the quarrel of Catholic Religion, than of all other Chriſtian Princes joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
               <p n="11">11. And foraſmuch as His Majeſty doth vouchſafe of his Princely Gratitude to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs in one part of his Inſtructions to his Son the Prince, That in all his Troubles, Streights, and Dangers, he hath found none ſo ſure and confident unto him, as thoſe that remained Loyal and Faithful to his good Mother the Queen, (who all for the moſt part were known to have been good Catholics) it is to be hoped that he will make the ſame Account alſo of You, that remained Conſtant and Dutiful, not only to Her Majeſty while ſhe lived, but to God's Divine Majeſty alſo, in ſtanding and ſuffering for your Conſcience in Religion; which was the Mark and Badge (if you remember) whereby the foreſaid famous Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> Father to our <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> did try his Chriſtian Courtiers, tho' he were a Pagan himſelf; rejecting thoſe who upon his Commandment and Invitation had yielded,<note place="margin">Euſeb. l. <hi>1.</hi> de vit. Conſtant. c. <hi>11.</hi>
                  </note> and done againſt their own Religion; and retaining and honoring others, that had been Conſtant even againſt himſelf: Which fact <hi>Euſebius</hi> recounteth, with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding praiſe of the Man's Judgment, Juſtice, and Piety therein; whoſe Example I hope our now King will imitate, and you follow the Example of the better ſort of thoſe Chriſtians, whom <hi>Conſtantius</hi> for their Conſtancy ſo much eſteemed and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced.</p>

            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> My <hi>firſt deſign</hi> was to have written only ſome few Leaves or Sheets of Paper in anſwer to Sir <hi>Francis Haſtings,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sir <hi>F. Haſtings</hi> in his <hi>Reply,</hi> pag. 192.</note> who in his <hi>Reply to the Seventh Encounter of the Warder</hi> (which <hi>Encounter</hi> concerneth principally the Biſhop and See of <hi>Rome</hi>) would ſeem to diminiſh that obligation of gratitude, which the <hi>Warder</hi> ſaid that <hi>England</hi> had above many other Nations to that See, for <hi>Two Converſions</hi> of our People to <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> receiv'd from thence. The <hi>Knight</hi> (I ſay) endeavored to ſtrike out or diminiſh that Obligation, by calling in doubt the ſaid <hi>Converſions,</hi> or cavilling at leaſt at ſome particulars thereof: Whereupon I thought it needful not only to confirm that which had been written before of the <hi>Two</hi> foreſaid Converſions under Pope <hi>Eleutherius</hi> and Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> I. but alſo to add a <hi>Third,</hi> more ancient than theſe <hi>Two,</hi> to wit under S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> himſelf, and ſome other <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> And albeit all this was meant ſo briefly (as I have ſaid) in the <hi>firſt deſignment;</hi> yet when I came to the <hi>Work</hi> it ſelf, it grew more long, and could hardly be diſpatched in ſo many <hi>Chapters,</hi> as I had purpoſed <hi>Leaves</hi> or <hi>Sheets</hi> at the beginning.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> The reaſon of this <hi>increaſe</hi> was, for that coming to the examination of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I found Sir <hi>Francis</hi> to have taken all that he had ſaid concerning that Point, out of <hi>John Fox,</hi> tho' he cited him not; and <hi>Fox</hi> again the moſt part of his Cavils out of the <hi>Magdeburgians:</hi> So as of neceſſity I was forc'd to encounter all theſe <hi>Three Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries</hi> together, to <hi>examin</hi> their <hi>Arguments,</hi> diſcover their <hi>Frauds,</hi> and refel their <hi>Follies.</hi> Which to do with any ſufficiency,<note place="margin">How the firſt Part of this Treatiſe was increaſed.</note> (as alſo with the <hi>clearneſs</hi> and <hi>perſpicui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> which I deſir'd) drew the matter on to a <hi>bigger Bulk</hi> than well could be ſet forth as a <hi>Part</hi> only of that <hi>Encounter</hi> whereunto it belonged: Whereupon, at the perſuaſion of ſome <hi>Friends,</hi> reſolution was taken to have it divulg'd in a <hi>ſeveral Treatiſe,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath been ſhewed in the end of the <hi>Second Encounter</hi> already printed.</p>

               <hi>18.</hi> But we on the contrary ſide do follow the courſe of the other party in coming to particulars, ſetting down firſt how Chriſt's Church and Religion began, by whom,<note place="margin">The applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the two former Examples.</note> and under whom; who were the firſt beginners, promoters and profeſſors thereof, what they taught, what they did, whom they left their ſucceſſors, with what promiſe and aſſurance of continuation, and finally how they endured unto this day. And all this is handled in the firſt part of this Treatiſe. And then in the ſecond is declared the other point before mentioned; to wit, that the adverſe heretical part, had never any houſe at all, and much leſs any ſuch as hath been ſpoken of; that is to ſay, they had never any Church or certain Family agreeing with it ſelf, nor ever any certain Profeſſion of any one Faith or Religion like in all points to it ſelf, or to that of any others, were it good or bad, falſe or true, Heretical or Catholic. And this is obſerved from the beginning of the world to our time, as you ſhall ſee manifeſtly proved afterwards in the proſecution of this work; deſiring thee (gentle Reader) to take the pains to read it over with ſome attention for thine own utility; tho' I preſume that thy contentment alſo in reading thereof will eaſily equal thy pains, the argument being hiſtorical, and not devoid of grateful variety both of times, men and affairs.</p>

            <p n="20">
               <hi>20.</hi> The firſt of which points is,<note place="margin">The firſt point how our arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Faith are above man's Reaſon.</note> That Almighty God for man's greater humility and merit in believing, hath placed the greater part of the object of our faith and belief (that is to ſay, the things which are to be believed) above the ordinary reach of man's reaſon, and invironed them with ſuch difficulty and obſcurity, in reſpect of our frailty, as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the light of his grace, and the concurſe and free motion of our own will and good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor, they are not to be attained unto. And this (as I ſaid) as well for man's humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, in reſpect of the heighth of God's myſteries revealed by faith; as alſo that man may merit by his free and willing concurſe to belief; which he would not do if the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles or object of our faith were ſo clear as there were no obſcurity or darkneſs in them: for then, according to the grounds of philoſophy, man's underſtanding perforce muſt yield thereunto, and conſequently our will alſo; whereof would enſue the loſs of all merit and reward, according to that Saying of S. Greg. <hi>Non habet fides meritum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Greg. hom. <hi>36.</hi> in Evang.</note> 
               <hi>ubi humana ratio praebet experimentum;</hi> Faith hath no merit where man's reaſon doth make the thing evident. And long before him S. Athan. <hi>Fides de re evidenti concepta,</hi>

               <hi>Fides dici non poteſt;</hi> Faith conceived of an evident matter, cannot be called Faith. And briefly, but pithily S. Aug. <hi>Laus fidei eſt; ſi, quod creditur, non videtur;</hi> The praiſe or merit of Faith ſtands in this, that the thing be not ſeen which is believed. And in another place, <hi>Credo, quod neſcio: &amp; propterea ſcio, quia ſcio, me neſcire quod neſcio;</hi> I do believe that which I know not: and thereby I come to know, for that I know my ſelf to have been ignorant in that which indeed I knew not. And finally S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> maketh this plain, when giving a definition of Faith, he writeth thus:<note place="margin">Hebr. <hi>11.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Eſt autem fides ſubſtantia ſperandarum rerum, argumentum non apparentium;</hi> Faith is the ſubſtance or ground of things hoped for (in the next life) and an argument of ſuch things as be not apparent or manifeſt to humane ſenſe or reaſon.

               <hi>21.</hi> But now concerning the cauſes of this difficulty or obſcurity in matters of belief,<note place="margin">Firſt cauſe of obſcurity in Faith.</note> the ſame Fathers do aſſign <hi>2</hi> or <hi>3</hi> for principal. The firſt is the heighth and ſublimity of the the articles and myſteries themſelves that are to be believed, which being of God's Secrets, do ſurpaſs the baſe capacity and reaſon of man. As are (for example) the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:104638:8"/>
of the world of nothing, the trinity of perſons in one nature of divinity, the incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Son of God, and his birth without violating his mothers virginity, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of our bodies, the being of Chriſt in the Sacrament, and the like; which hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man reaſon cannot reach unto,<note place="margin">Second cauſe.</note> tho' they be not contrary to it, but above it. Another cauſe is (as S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> noteth) the Majeſty of Almighty God, who will be believed at his word,<note place="margin">Ambr. l. <hi>1.</hi> de Abraham c. <hi>3.</hi>
               </note> without being asked for proof or reaſon for the ſame. <hi>For if</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>a grave honorable perſonage in this life, (eſpecially if he be of high authority, and our ſuperior) will take it in diſdain to be asked a proof for that he affirmeth; how much more ought God to be credited without proof of human reaſon, when he propoſeth unto us a matter above our reach or capacity?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="22">
               <note place="margin">Third cauſe.</note>
               <hi>22.</hi> The third cauſe is that which before I touched, that Man might merit more by believing that which he ſeeth not evident, according to the Saying of Chriſt to S. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,<note place="margin">Joan. <hi>2.</hi>
               </note>

And for all theſe cauſes, if we conſider the matter well, we ſhall find that God hath proceeded ſtrangely to man's eye from the beginning of the world, in revealing the myſteries of our Faith unto us; diſcovering his will on the one ſide, with infinite teſtification of his love and deſire that we ſhould know them; and yet on the other ſide, with ſuch reſervation in thoſe revelations, as the matter might ſtill be difficult, hard, or obſcure, in ſome reſpect; and this for the greater merit (as hath been ſaid) of the believer.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.6.7.8.</note> As for example, before the flood he appeared to divers Patriarchs from time to time, cauſing them to preach and open to others his will, and the truth of that Faith which they were bound to believe; but yet he appeared not to all in thoſe days, which he might have done if he would, and thereby have made the matter more clear and out of doubt: but he would have them believe others by words and tradition.

               </note> And then again four or five hundred years after that, when he determined to bring the <hi>Hebrew</hi> people out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and to give them a written Law, he appeared not evidently to all the people, but choſe <hi>Moſes</hi> to ſend unto them in his name, and ſpake to him out of a fiery buſh at the beginning, and at other times out of a cloud on the top of a hill.

The cauſe whereof is, for that Faith is grounded upon a more certain foundation than is human ſcience, to wit, upon the credit and authority of God himſelf: wherein alſo is to be noted, that theſe Inductions and Arguments of credibility, may be much more evident to ſome than to others. As for example, the Miracles done by God in bringing home of the <hi>Jews</hi> from <hi>Egypt,</hi> were much more evident to thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> that then lived, and were preſent and ſaw them, than to others that came afterwards. Albeit the Faith and Belief of ſome of the later, might be as firm and conſtant as the former. And ſo the Miracles of Chriſt and his Apoſtles were more evident to thoſe that ſaw them, than unto us that hear them only by relation; tho' yet our Faith may be as good and firm, yea more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable and meritorious than theirs, in that we believe them without ſeeing, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the aforeſaid Saying of our Saviour to S. <hi>Thomas.</hi> And this is the great Piety and Mercy of Almighty God, that we that come after in the end of the World ſhall loſe nothing (if we will) by our ſo late coming, but may be equal in merit to the firſt.</p>

               <p>THe purpoſe of this firſt Part (gentle Reader) is, to declare by evident demonſtration, both of Histories, Reaſons, Antiquities, and Succeſſion of Times, and by confeſſion and other teſtimonies of the Adverſaries themſelves, That this our Iſle of <hi>England,</hi> and People thereof, the <hi>Britans, Saxons,</hi> and <hi>Engliſh,</hi> have at three ſeveral times received Chriſtian Faith from <hi>Rome,</hi> and by <hi>Romiſh</hi> Preachers. <hi>Firſt,</hi> under the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> in the firſt Age after Chriſt; And <hi>then</hi> under Pope <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> in the ſecond Age; And <hi>thirdly,</hi> under Pope <hi>Gregory,</hi> in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ſixth Age: And that <hi>this</hi> Faith and Religion was no other than the <hi>Roman Catholic Faith,</hi> generally received over all <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> in thoſe days; And that it was <hi>One,</hi> and the <hi>Self-ſame</hi> Faith, at all theſe three times; and that the ſame was continued and profeſſed after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in <hi>England</hi> publicly for almoſt <hi>1400</hi> years together, to wit, from the Apoſtles days, unto the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. under divers Nations, States, Governments, and variety of Times, by <hi>Britans, Saxons, Danes, Normans,</hi> and <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and that the ſelf-ſame Faith continueth at this day in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and Chriſtian Catholic World abroad, without change or altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any one ſubſtantial Article, or Point of Belief; and that all Cavils and Calumniations of Heretics and Sectaries in this behalf are vain and fooliſh, and moſt manifeſtly here confuted.

And if it be moſt certain, and cannot be denied, that theſe two ſo great and univerſal benefits rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered are the higheſt under Heaven that our Land could receive from any mortal then, and that the Obligation of this double Spiritual Birth of ours is ſo much greater than the Bond we owe to our carnal Parents, by how much more weighty and important is our Eternal Salvation than our Temporal Life and Generation: let all men conſider the barbarous ingratitude of this man, that barketh with ſuch ſpite againſt the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Mother of our Chriſtianity, and againſt her Biſhops, the Workers of ſo high a Bleſſing to us. And with this conſideration I leave the modeſt and diſcreet Readers to judge of the matter, as Reaſon and Religion ſhall induce them, and not as the rage of this and other ſuch raving people would incite them.</q>

               <p n="3">3. Thus I wrote then, and to this declaration and concluſion of mine, our Knight taketh upon him now to anſwer in theſe words: <hi>Whereas this</hi> Roman <hi>Advocate ſaith,</hi>

                  <hi>That this Land ought to bear more reverence to the See of</hi> Rome <hi>than other Nations, for that it hath received more ſingular benefits from thence, namely, that it was converted from Paganiſm to Chriſtian Religion by the ſpecial Diligence, Labor, and Induſtry of the ſame See; I anſwer, Firſt, That it is apparent by ſundry Teſtimonies, that this Land was converted to the Faith long before that time by you ſpecified, and not by the Biſhop of</hi> Rome. Gildas <hi>teſtifieth that</hi> Britanny <hi>received the Goſpel in the time of</hi> Tiberius <hi>the Emperor, and that</hi> Joſeph <hi>of</hi> Arimathea <hi>was ſent by</hi> Philip <hi>the Apoſtle from</hi> France <hi>hither, where he remained till his death. And</hi> Bede <hi>(our Country man likewiſe) doth teſtifie, That in his time this Land kept</hi> Eaſter <hi>after the manner of the</hi> Eaſt Church; <hi>by which my be gathered, that the firſt Preachers came hither from the</hi> Eaſt <hi>parts of the World, and not from</hi> Rome. <hi>More proofs might be ſet down, but I ſpare them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Mark (good Reader) what manner of Anſwer this is to my former Speech. and how directly theſe people do go to the matter. I ſaid before, That the Iſle of <hi>England,</hi> wherein ſo many at this day do rail againſt <hi>Rome,</hi> hath more obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Love towards the ſame for benefits received, than divers other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; for that the people of this Iſland have been twice converted by men ſent from thence; once, under Pope <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> almoſt 200 years after Chriſt, and again under Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, about the year of our Lord 600. Now to this the Kt. thinketh to have anſwered well, by affirming two or three things; Firſt out of <hi>Gildas, That</hi> Britanny <hi>received the Goſpel in the time of</hi> Tiberius <hi>the Emperor,</hi> before any or theſe two Converſions named by me: Which how like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is, (<hi>Tiberius</hi> living but five years after Chriſt's Aſcenſion) ſhall after be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined. Secondly, That <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> was ſent by <hi>Philip</hi> the Apoſtle out of <hi>France</hi> into <hi>Britanny,</hi> which yet the true <hi>Gildas</hi> hath not: But by theſe two Examples the Knight would ſhew, That in <hi>Britanny</hi> the Faith of Chriſt was not firſt of all planted from <hi>Rome,</hi> nor by the Popes thereof, or by their induſtry. And to the ſame effect he allegeth out of <hi>Bede, the uſed of obſerving</hi> Eaſter <hi>after the manner of the</hi> Eaſt Church <hi>remaining amongſt the</hi> Britans <hi>in his
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:104638:12"/>
time;</hi> whereof he inferreth, as you ſee, <hi>That it is moſt like that our firſt Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were from the</hi> Eaſt, <hi>and not from the</hi> Weſt Church.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But ſuppoſe all theſe things were true; do they overthrow that which I ſaid before in my <hi>Ward-word,</hi> that the <hi>Britans</hi> were converted under Pope <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> or the <hi>Saxons</hi> under Pope <hi>Gregory,</hi> and by ſeveral Preachers ſent from <hi>Rome</hi> by them?<note place="margin">How imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of the Knight is.</note> They prove only that before theſe two public Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which we owe to the Church and Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> there might be ſome ſparkles of Chriſtian Faith alſo in <hi>Britanny</hi> by other means; which I never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd, but only ſaid that I would have <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> grateful to <hi>Rome</hi> for theſe two; which Converſions no man can deny, without apparent impudence, as after more amply ſhall be ſhewed, where alſo theſe Examples alleged out of <hi>Gildas</hi> and St. <hi>Bede</hi> ſhall be examined, how far they are true, or do make for the purpoſe here in hand.</p>

So that this firſt part of Sir <hi>Francis</hi>'s Anſwer being nothing to the purpoſe, as you ſee, tho' all were granted, which he allegeth; Let us hear his ſecond part. <hi>Secondly,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>tho' it be granted that</hi> Eleutherius <hi>ſending hither Preachers from</hi> Rome <hi>in King</hi> Lucius <hi>his time, did friſt convert this Land to the Chriſtian Faith,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">I ſay.</note> 
                  <hi>I ſay that there is not now the ſame Faith in</hi> Rome <hi>that was then: There were then no Maſſes ſaid, no ſetting up of Images in Churches,</hi> &amp;c. Here now, if we will take Sir <hi>Francis</hi>'s word, we have a ſure warrant by his <hi>[I ſay]</hi> that the Faith in <hi>Rome</hi> is not the ſame now, that it was in Pope <hi>Eleutherius</hi> his time; and that in particular, <hi>there were neither Maſſes then, nor Images.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you may note, firſt, that cunningly he holdeth his peace of the Converſion of <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> under St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> (which moſt concerneth us that be of this Nation) for that he dareth not deny that both Maſs and Images were in uſe in his time in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church and Faith; and ſo brought into <hi>England</hi> by St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> that converted us:<note place="margin">Bed. lib. <hi>1.</hi> hiſt.

                  </note> which is evident in St. <hi>Bede</hi> in every place of his Story, and particularly where he relateth the firſt entrance of St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> and his Fellows into <hi>Canterbury,</hi> in Proceſſion, with a Croſs and Image of our Savior in a Banner, and that they ſaid their firſt Maſſes there in an old Church of St. <hi>Martin,</hi> builded, as he ſaith, by the old Chriſtian <hi>Romans</hi> before their departure out of <hi>Britanny.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. And for the time of <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> under whom the <hi>Britans</hi> were converted, tho' it were not hard alſo to prove the ſame particulars; yet will I not take that diſputation now in hand, but ſhall leave it to a better occaſion afterward in this Treatiſe; where, without ſtanding upon theſe particular two Doctrins of Maſs and Images, here mentioned by the Knight, I ſhall ſhew more general and firm Arguments that the Faith of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> under <hi>Eleutherius,</hi>

               <p n="8">8.

And the like might we ſhew about the uſe of Images, but that it were over long for this place; our intention being only to treat of the Converſion of our Countrey to Chriſtian Religion; and to note by the way, Which is moſt to be credited by a diſcreet man,<note place="margin">

               <p n="15">15. And thus much of the Time and Occaſion whereby Chriſtian Religion began firſt in <hi>Britany,</hi> within the firſt fifty years after Chriſt's Aſcenſion; whereto alſo we may add the Teſtimony of <hi>Nicephorus,</hi>

Tho' who indeed were the very firſt Teachers in <hi>Britanny,</hi> and Preachers in particular, or Helpers thereunto, is not ſo certain; our ancient Hiſtoriographers, by reaſon of the variety of Times, and our Countries Calamities, having left no clear Teſtimony thereof. True it is,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:104638:14"/>
that our later Writers of the Engliſh Nation,<note place="margin">Holinſh. in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript. Britan. rom. <hi>1.</hi> cap. <hi>9.</hi> Cambd. in ſua Brit. p. <hi>162.</hi>

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it may be inferred, that if it be true that ſhe ſent thoſe firſt Meſſages, Books or Meſſengers of Chriſtian Knowledge into her Country, ſhe was alſo the firſt, or one of the firſt Helpers to that Converſion.</p>
               <p n="17">17. But now the proofs of this mater are not ſo ſtrong as I could wiſh or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, for the Honor of our Country; but let us hear them as they be. <hi>Firſt,</hi> the proof that ſhe was a <hi>Britain,</hi> is by certain Verſes of <hi>Martial</hi> the Poet, written unto her in his Epigrams, thus:
<q>
                     <l>
                        <note place="margin">Mart. lib. <hi>11.</hi> Epig. <hi>35.</hi>

                     <l>Edita, cur Latiae pectora plebis habet?</l>
                  </q>
Whereas <hi>Claudia Ruffina</hi> is born of the <hi>Britans</hi> (that paint themſelves) how cometh it to paſs that ſhe hath gained ſo much the good wills of the <hi>Italian</hi> People? And then he goeth forward to praiſe her alſo for her Beauty, exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Beauty either of <hi>Italians</hi> or <hi>Grecians.</hi> He commendeth her beſides for three Children which ſhe had born to her Husband, and theſe Children our men would interpret to be the foreſaid two Virgins <hi>Praxedes</hi> and <hi>Pudentiana,</hi> together with <hi>Novatus</hi> their Brother, all Children of <hi>Pudens</hi> the Senator above-named.</p>
               <p n="18">18. But altho' I could wiſh much (as I ſaid) for the Honor of our Nation, that this thing were true, eſpecially her being the Wife to <hi>Pudens,</hi> and Mother of the foreſaid Children, that were all Saints; yet have I great Arguments to the contrary:<note place="margin">Arguments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſtory of <hi>Claudia Ruffina.</hi>
                  </note> Whereof the firſt is the ſilence of all Antiquity in this behalf. <hi>Martial</hi> alſo being a Heathen, and Enemy to Chriſtians, would hardly have commended her ſo much, and written Epigrams to her of her rare Beauty, if ſhe had been a Chriſtian, which was the moſt odious thing that might be in thoſe days; nor could ſhe be ſo Beautiful in his time, living under <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> and dying under <hi>Trajan,</hi> during whoſe Reign it appeareth in <hi>Martial</hi> that theſe Verſes were written; for ſo much as ſhe muſt needs be very old in thoſe days,<note place="margin">Baron. in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr. ad diem <hi>19</hi> Maii.</note> ſeeing that <hi>Pudens</hi> his Houſe, placed <hi>in declivo Montis Scauri,</hi> in the ſide of the Hill called <hi>Scaurus,</hi> was the firſt (by Tradition of all Antiquity) that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and afterward St. <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> and is at this day a Church dedicated to his Daughter St. <hi>Pudentiana;</hi> and from the arrival of St. <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> until the time of <hi>Trajan,</hi> were almoſt ſixty years. So as if ſhe were Wife of <hi>Pudens,</hi> and Mother of thoſe Children, when St. <hi>Peter</hi> came to <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhe muſt needs be very aged, when <hi>Martial</hi> wrote thoſe Verſes of her Beauty.

                  </hi> What ſenſe, I ſay, or conſtruction can this have?

And it may be it was written after Dinner by theſe good <hi>Germans,</hi> when they had drunk hard, and ſo I leave it to their own Explication; though in what ſenſe ſoever they ſpeak it, or it may be underſtood, a moſt fond Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture it is for that which they pretend, (as we have ſhewed) to wit, that the firſt Preachers of <hi>Britanny</hi> came from the Eaſt.</p>

So as our <hi>German</hi> Heretics appointing him, for his more credit, to have lived in the year of Chriſt 700, do add of their own benevolence to his Antiquity 450 years, which is ſomewhat more than <hi>Fox</hi> took from St. <hi>Bede</hi> a little before, to diſcredit him, and make him ſeem a young Author.<note place="margin">Notable Falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of <hi>Fox</hi> and <hi>Magdebur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians</hi> in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting of Times.</note> And theſe Confederates do proceed ſo ridiculouſly in this kind of Cozenage, as the one affirming St. <hi>Bede</hi> to have lived 1000 years after Chriſt, and the other that <hi>Geffry</hi> of <hi>Monmouth</hi> lived 700, they come between them both to make the ſaid <hi>Geffry</hi> to be 300 years elder than St. <hi>Bede,</hi> whereas he was indeed 450 years younger, the difference is in all 750 years. And this is not of Error, as hath been ſhewed, and is moſt plain, but of Envy, deſiring to prefer <hi>Geffry,</hi> that ſeemeth to favour them ſometimes in his Narrations about St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> and to put back St. <hi>Bede,</hi> that is every where and wholly againſt them.

                  <p>Of the Second Converſion of <hi>Britanny</hi> under King <hi>Lucius,</hi> by Pope <hi>Eleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therius,</hi> and Teachers ſent from him, about the year of Chriſt <hi>180;</hi> and of the notorious abſurd Cavillations of Heretics about the ſame alſo.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>ALL that hitherto hath been ſpoken is about the firſt Preaching of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion in <hi>Britanny</hi> by particular men within the firſt Age, or hundred years after Chriſt; which our <hi>Roman</hi> Enemies, only upon Envy and Animoſity, without any one Teſtimony of Antiquity, will needs take from <hi>Rome</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and give it to the <hi>Grecians</hi> of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and to the Eaſt parts, as you have heard. Now do follow two other more famous and public Converſions of the ſaid Iſland under the two renowned Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> and by their ſpecial Induſtry; which are acknowledged and regiſtred by the whole Chriſtian World, and do ſo much preſs the Spleen and move the Gall of our <hi>Rome</hi>-biters, as they leave no corner of their Wits unſifted to diſcredit or reject the ſame.</p>

The firſt Converſion was (as the Warder ſaith) under Pope <hi>Eleutherius</hi> towards the end of the ſecond Age after Chriſt; when King <hi>Lucius</hi> of <hi>Britanny</hi> hearing of the great and horrible Perſecutions of Chriſtians in <hi>Rome,</hi> and of their often Martyrings, and that they remained conſtant notwitſtanding in their Chriſtian Faith, to all mens admiration, and that their number did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe daily, even of the chiefeſt Nobility, and that two worthy Senators in particular, <hi>Pertinax</hi> and <hi>Tretellius,</hi> had been lately converted from Paganiſm to profeſs Chriſt; yea, that the Emperour himſelf, <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> then living, began to be a Friend to Chriſtians in reſpect of a famous Victory ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by their Prayers,<note place="margin">Baron. in annal.

And underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the chief Fountain thereof to be at <hi>Rome,</hi> contented not himſelf either with Inſtructions he might have at home by Chriſtians there, nor yet from the Chriſtian Biſhops flouriſhing then in <hi>France,</hi> as St. <hi>Irenaeus, Photinus,</hi> and others, but ſent men to <hi>Rome</hi> to demand Preachers of <hi>Eleutherius</hi> the Pope; who directed to him two <hi>Romans,</hi>

For that about the particular times wherein things were done, there is often found no ſmall variety among principal Writers, and about principal Points and Myſteries of our Faith; as, about the coming of the <hi>Magi,</hi> and Martyrdom of the Infants; about the time of Chriſt's Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, yea alſo of his Paſſion, what Year and Day each of theſe things happened; which yet doth not derogate from the certainty of the things themſelves.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And this is his firſt Cavil, or rather light Skirmiſh,<note place="margin">Firſt Cavil.</note> whereby he would ſomewhat batter or weaken the credit of the Story, before he cometh to lay the full Aſſault, which enſueth immediately, with ſeven double Cannons planted by him, which he calleth <hi>ſeven good conjectural Reaſons,</hi> againſt the Tradition of Antiquity about this Converſion of <hi>Britanny</hi> from Pope <hi>Eleuthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius.</hi> Wherein notwithſtanding you muſt note, That he propoſeth the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie as tho' his purpoſe were only to prove that Pope <hi>Eleutherius</hi> was not the firſt that converted <hi>England;</hi> which thing,<note place="margin">The effect of 7 Cannons planted by <hi>Jo.

                  </note> as it might be granted in the ſenſe before often touched, if he ſpake or meant plainly, ſo finding him to deal guilefully, and to go about to prove in the end (as appeareth by his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion) that <hi>Eleutherius</hi> converted not King <hi>Lucius</hi> at all, but only helpt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps to convert him, or to inſtruct him better in Religion (being a Chriſtian before) I am conſtrained to examin briefly the Force (or rather Fraud and Folly) of theſe his ſeven Arguments, to the end you may judge thereby, how he behaveth himſelf in ſo main a Volume as his <hi>Acts and Monuments</hi> do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, ſeeing that in this one matter he beareth himſelf ſo fondly and mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly, And for brevities ſake I will reduce the ſaid ſeven Arguments to three general Heads or Kinds; ſhewing firſt, that all are <hi>Impertinent;</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that ſome, beſides Impertinency have alſo <hi>groſs Ignorance;</hi> thirdly, that others, beſides theſe two commendations, have <hi>Fraud</hi> and <hi>plain Impoſture</hi> in them.</p>

                  <hi>and that</hi> Nicephorus <hi>ſaith that</hi> Simon Zelotes <hi>preached the Goſpel in</hi> England. All which three Arguments, as they do ſerve to no purpoſe here, but to ſhew that <hi>Fox</hi> ſtealeth all out of the <hi>Magdeburgians,</hi> ſo no other Anſwer is needful to be made unto them, than that which before hath been written; ſeeing that, all being granted that here is ſaid, yet proveth it nothing that <hi>the Faith of</hi> Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanny <hi>came not from</hi> Rome; and conſequently all is impertinent.</p>

Of the ſecond ſort both <hi>Impertinent</hi> and <hi>Ignorant</hi> Arguments, are his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and third probations: <hi>My ſecond reaſon is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>out of</hi> Tertullian, <hi>who living near-about, or rather ſomewhat before this</hi> Eleutherius, <hi>teſtifieth in his Book</hi> contra Judaeos, <hi>that the Goſpel was diſperſed abroad by the ſound of Apoſtles in divers Countreys; and then among other Kingdoms he reciteth alſo the parts of</hi> Britanny, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus you ſee how impertinent it is to the purpoſe we have in hand; for that it concludeth not but that Pope <hi>Eleutherius</hi> after the Apoſtles time might convert King <hi>Lucius</hi> and his People publicly by <hi>Fugatius</hi> and <hi>Damia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> as we affirm. And then ſecondly, it includeth notorious Error and Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,<note place="margin">

                  </note> in that he ſaith <hi>Tertullian lived before Eleutherius;</hi> for that it is prov'd out of <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s own Works and Words, eſpecially in his Book <hi>de Pallio,</hi> (wherein he yieldeth the reaſon wherefore he changed his Habit from a Gown to a Cloak, as Chriſtians were wont to do in thoſe days) that he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to the Chriſtian Faith in the tenth year of Pope <hi>Victor,</hi> that was Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor to <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> which was <hi>Anno Domini</hi> 196. And moreover, he wrote his Book <hi>contra Judaeos,</hi> cited by <hi>Fox,</hi> divers years after that again, as <hi>Pame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> and others do demonſtrate in his Life.<note place="margin">Jac.

                  </note> So as <hi>Eleutherius</hi> reigning fifteen years before <hi>Victor</hi> (as all Authors do agree) it followeth that he was Pope twenty five years before <hi>Tertullian</hi> was a Chriſtian: And forſomuch as the Converſion of <hi>England</hi> is aſſigned to have been in the fifth year of <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> it followeth that <hi>Tertullian</hi> was not a Chriſtian in twenty years after that time.

And it is not only Ignorance, but wilful Malice and Impoſture alſo, in <hi>John Fox,</hi> to make his Reader believe (as before in <hi>Tertullian,</hi> ſo in this Man) that he was either Equal or Elder than Pope <hi>Eleutherius.</hi> And for this cauſe, that <hi>Origen</hi> in his foreſaid Homily muſt needs mean of a former Converſion of <hi>Britanny,</hi>

               <p>Thus ſaith he, and citeth for his proof in the Margin, <hi>Ex Epiſtola Eleutherii ad Lucium;</hi> and by this laſt and ſtrongeſt Argument of his, the ſilly Fellow thinketh to ſtrike the Nail dead, and to prove that King <hi>Lucius</hi> was a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian before he received Preachers from Pope <hi>Eleutherius;</hi> and conſequently, that all is falſe which Antiquity hath held, attributing the Converſion of that Kingdom, and of the King himſelf, to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi> For which cauſe <hi>Fox</hi> addeth preſently, <hi>Peradventure</hi> Eleutherius <hi>might help ſomething either to convert the King, or elſe to increaſe the Faith newly ſprung up then among the People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">13. So defineth he the matter; and conſider, I pray you, what he attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buteth to <hi>Eleutherius</hi> in this Converſion: <hi>Peradventure</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>he might help ſomething to King</hi> Lucius <hi>his Converſion.</hi> And is not this a great matter, eſpecially being qualified (as it is) with the reſtriction <hi>Peradventure?</hi> If a man ſhould ſay of <hi>Aeſop</hi>'s Fables, that <hi>peradventure ſome of them in ſome points might be true;</hi> were it not as much as <hi>John Fox</hi> doth attribute to all this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of Authors for this Converſion under Pope <hi>Eleutherius;</hi> ſeeing he ſaith not abſolutely, <hi>Eleutherius did convert King</hi> Lucius, or help indeed thereunto, but that <hi>peradventure he might help ſomething,</hi> &amp;c.? You may mark the diminutives uſed by <hi>Fox</hi> to leſſen the benefit, to wit, <hi>peradventure, might, ſomething,</hi> &amp;c. and thereby conſider what a holy ſtomach he hath to <hi>Rome,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Contempt of the Teſtimony of Antiquity.</note> and what little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count he maketh of the Authority or Conſent of all Antiquity, when they make againſt him.</p>
               <p n="14">14. But now let us weigh further his Proofs, and by them alſo his Frauds and Impoſtures. Firſt of all for Proofs, that King <hi>Lucius</hi> was a Chriſtian be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he dealt with <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> he alledgeth the Epiſtle it ſelf of <hi>Eleutherius;</hi> which he ſetteth down as authentical, citing only in the Margin, <hi>Ex vetuſto codice Regum antiquorum,</hi> taken out of an old Book of old Kings, but telleth not where we ſhall find this old Book; and it may be (perhaps) of as good credit (if it were found) as the Book of <hi>Gildas</hi> before alledged, <hi>De Victoria Aurelii Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſii,</hi> or as many other fabulous things be in the Story of <hi>Geffrey of Monmouth,</hi> and <hi>John Fox</hi> after him.</p>

                  </note>15. And indeed if we conſider the beginning of the firſt words of the Epiſtle it ſelf, we ſhall find certain doubts, which neither <hi>Fox</hi> nor his Fellows will ever be able to ſolve; as firſt of all, that it was written after <hi>Eleutherius</hi> was dead; for ſo it appeareth by the Account of Time noted in the Title, which is this in <hi>Latin,</hi> as <hi>Fox</hi> relateth: <hi>Anno Domini</hi> 169 <hi>à Paſſione Chriſti ſcripſit D.</hi> Eleutherius <hi>Papa,</hi> Lucio <hi>Regi</hi> Britanniae <hi>ad correctionem Regis &amp; Procetum Regni,</hi> &amp;c. Which words <hi>Fox</hi> omitteth to tranſlate into <hi>Engliſh,</hi> for that they make againſt him, and therefore would not have his unlearned Reader to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the abſurdity thereof; for they ſay, <hi>That Pope</hi> Eleutherius <hi>wrote this Epiſtle to</hi> Lucius <hi>King of</hi> Britanny, <hi>to correct both Him and the Nobility of his Kingdom, in the year</hi> 169 <hi>after the Paſſion of Chriſt:</hi> To which 169 years if we add other 33, which Chriſt lived before his Paſſion, they make 202; which is 19 years after <hi>Eleutherius</hi>'s Death, who dy'd in the year of Chriſt 184, as all Authors agree. For which cauſe <hi>Fox</hi> himſelf, in this very place, and elſewhere often, doth appoint the Converſion of King <hi>Lucius</hi> to have been in
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:104638:26"/>
the year of Chriſt 180, and the <hi>10th</hi> of <hi>Eleutherius</hi> his Reign; but this Epiſtle appointeth it 22 years after, to wit, <hi>Anno Domini</hi> 102. So wiſe a man is <hi>Fox</hi> in bringing it in!</p>
               <p n="16">16. Secondly, this Epiſtle was written in <hi>Latin,</hi> and ſo ſhould <hi>Fox</hi> have delivered the ſame unto us wholly, if he had dealt plainly:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Fox</hi>'s ſubtilty in concealing the Original in <hi>Latin.</hi>
                  </note> But he hath not ſo done, but only giveth us the Title in <hi>Latin,</hi> without any Interpretation, as now hath been ſaid; and the remnant (or at leaſtwiſe ſo much as he thought convenient) in <hi>Engliſh</hi> only, and this of his own Tranſlation, without letting us ſee the Original; and ſo he playeth the <hi>Fox</hi> in every thing. But, to return again to this <hi>Latin</hi> Title of the Epiſtle, there is another cauſe why <hi>John Fox</hi> would not tranſlate it into <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and this is, for that it is ſaid therein that it was written by the Pope <hi>ad correctionem Regis, &amp; Procerum Regni,</hi> &amp;c. to correct the King, and Nobility of the Realm: which proveth that the Pope took himſelf to be their Superior alſo in thoſe days, and they to be ſubject to his correction. For which cauſes <hi>Fox</hi>'s Scholars, <hi>Holinſhead, Hooker,</hi> and <hi>Harriſon,</hi> do leave out this Title altogether in their Chronicles; for that the word <hi>Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> upon the King and Nobility, is an odious thing in theſe days, eſpecially from Popes.</p>
               <p n="17">17. And thus much of the Title, and Fraud uſed therein. Now let us paſs to the Body of the Epiſtle. Thus it beginneth in <hi>John Fox</hi>'s Tranſlation;<note place="margin">Fox pag. <hi>96.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Ye require of us the</hi> Roman <hi>Laws and the Emperours to be ſent over unto you, which you may practiſe and put in are within your Realm. The</hi> Roman <hi>Laws and the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours we may ever reprove, but the Law of God we may not. You have received of late, through God's Mercy, in the Realm of</hi> Britanny <hi>the Law of Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. Thus ſaith the Epiſtle, and out of theſe laſt words <hi>John Fox</hi> doth frame his former ſeventh Argument, That King <hi>Lucius</hi> had received the Faith of Chriſt <hi>before he ſent to</hi> Eleutherius <hi>for the</hi> Roman <hi>Laws.</hi> Well, ſuppoſe it was ſo, and that this ſending was a ſecond Embaſſage ſome years after his Converſion; how doth this infer that King <hi>Lucius</hi> was a Chriſtian before he dealt with <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> or before he ſent the firſt time unto him; and ſo that he was rather converted by <hi>Grecians</hi> than by <hi>Romans,</hi> as the next immediate words of <hi>Fox</hi> are? <hi>And that hence it may be inferred that</hi> Eleutherius <hi>did rather help perhaps to his Converſion, or to increaſe the Faith newly ſprung up, than convert him.</hi> Are not theſe notorious ſhifts, and ſhameleſs windings of our <hi>Fox,</hi> to delude his Reader.</p>
               <p n="18">18. But you will ask me perhaps, how I do prove that this was a ſecond Embaſſage ſent by King <hi>Lucius to</hi> Eleutherius, <hi>and the Pope's Anſwer to the ſame?</hi> Whereto I ſay, that this is confeſſed and proved by <hi>Fox</hi> himſelf; who writing of King <hi>Lucius</hi> ſaith, That ſome years after his Converſion, when he had put his Realm in Order for matters of Religion, he wrote again to have the Civil and Imperial Laws ſent over to him, whereby to govern his Kingdom accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Chriſtian Religion.</p>
               <p n="19">19. All this, I ſay, doth <hi>Fox</hi> ſet down afterward very particularly,<note place="margin">Fox Act and Monument pag. <hi>96.</hi> col. <hi>2.</hi> n. <hi>30.</hi>
                  </note> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that after King <hi>Lucius</hi> and his Realm had received the Baptiſm of Chriſt, were made Chriſtians, and had turned twenty-eight Heathen Flamens, and three Archflamens, that were before of Gentiles, into ſo many Chriſtian Biſhops and Archbiſhops: All this being done and well ſettled,<note place="margin">Act &amp; Mon. ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>the foreſaid King</hi> Lucius (ſaith he) <hi>ſent again to the ſaid</hi> Eleutherius <hi>for the</hi> Roman <hi>Laws, thereby likewiſe to be governed, as in Religion now they were framed accordingly: <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto whom</hi> Eleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therius <hi>again writeth after the tenor of theſe words following;</hi> Ye require of us the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="20">20. Whereby it is evident, that this Letter of <hi>Eleutherius</hi> (if it be true, and not feigned by <hi>Fox</hi>) was written to King <hi>Lucius</hi> ſome number of years after his Converſion, ſeeing he could not ſetttle his Realm, as here <hi>Fox</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth,

but in ſome good ſpace of time. <hi>Holinſhead, Hooker,</hi> and <hi>Harriſon</hi> (Diſciples alſo of this <hi>Fox</hi>) in this do take upon them to determine the Time, (tho' I know not by what Authority) ſaying, That it was three years after King <hi>Lucius</hi> his Converſion and Baptiſm.<note place="margin">Holinſh. p. <hi>24.</hi> deſcript.

But now to the ſubſtance of the Letter it ſelf, or rather of the piece or parcel that it hath pleaſed <hi>Fox</hi> and theſe his Scholars to impart with us. You muſt note firſt, That theſe good Scholars ſeeing their Maſter to have left us this <hi>Engliſh</hi> Epiſtle of <hi>Eleutherius</hi> ſo imperfect and curtail'd, as it ſeemeth to have neither end or juſt beginning, do ſay that the reſt was loſt, which yet <hi>Fox</hi> telleth us not. Secondly, they ſeeing the Title to make much againſt them, left it out, as before hath been ſaid. Thirdly, touching the very Corps it ſelf of the Epiſtle ſet down by him, they put it down ſo different both in Words, Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, Authorities, and Texts of Scripture, from that which <hi>Fox</hi> hath; as it ſheweth either the thing to be wholly feigned by Them, or their Maſter; or that they have a great Liberty and Priviledge to alter the ſame at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</p>
               <p n="23">23. And this would be ſufficient for this matter; but further perchance you might demand, Why this Epiſtle of <hi>Eleutherius</hi> is alledged and urged ſo earneſtly by them, ſeeing it ſeemeth to make ſo little for them? Whereunto I anſwer,<note place="margin">Firſt Cauſe.</note> That the chiefeſt Cauſes ſeem to be two or three. The firſt, That <hi>Fox</hi> might frame thereupon his former fooliſh Argument, That foraſmuch as by this Epiſtle it appeareth that King <hi>Lucius</hi> was a Chriſtian when this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle was written by <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> it may ſeem that <hi>Eleutherius</hi> converted him not, nor any other ſent from <hi>Rome;</hi> the falſhood and childiſhneſs of which Argument hath been ſufficiently laid open before.</p>
               <p n="24">
                  <note place="margin">Second Cauſe.</note>24. The ſecond Cauſe is, to found two points of Doctrin thereon. The one, That Scriptures only are ſufficient to govern any Kingdom without other Eccleſiaſtical, Civil, or Temporal Laws; which yet themſelves do not pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, where they have Dominion, as experience teacheth us. The other point is, That every King is God's Vicar, that is to ſay, abſolute and ſupreme Head in all Cauſes as well Spiritual as Temporal within his Realm; and to this end is brought in the Teſtimony of this Letter of <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> not only by <hi>Fox, Holinſhead, Hooker, Harriſon, Haſtings,</hi> and other of that Crew, taking one from another that Argument; but even their great Champion <hi>Jewell,</hi> as <hi>Holinſhead</hi> relateth in the firſt Volume of his Stories.</p>

                  </note>25. <hi>The Reverend Father</hi> John Jewell (ſaith he) <hi>ſometime Biſhop of</hi> Salisbury, <hi>writeth in his Reply unto</hi> Harding<hi>'s Anſwer, That the ſaid</hi> Eleutherius, <hi>for general Order to be taken in the Realm and Churches here, wrote his advice to</hi> Lucius <hi>in manner and form following:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jewell fo. <hi>119.</hi>
                  </note>

                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:104638:27"/>26. Theſe are the words alledged by Maſter <hi>Jewel</hi> out of this Epiſtle; which differ not much from that which is in <hi>Fox</hi> and <hi>Holinſhead:</hi> But both of them do add a third Clauſe out of the ſaid Epiſtle, which is this;<note place="margin">Fox Acts and Mon. p. <hi>96.</hi> Hol. deſcript.

You ſhall be a King while you rule well; but if you do otherwiſe, the name of a King ſhall not remain with you, but you ſhall utterly loſe and forgo it, which God forbid.</hi> And then maketh <hi>Holinſhead</hi> this Annotation in theſe words; <hi>Hitherto out of the Epiſtle that</hi> Eleutherius <hi>ſent unto</hi> Lucius; <hi>wherein many pretty Obſervations are to be collected, if time and place would ſerve to ſtand upon them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="27">27. So he ſaith; but what Annotations theſe are he declareth not, tho' it be eaſie to gueſs by others which he maketh in other places: For that in the very next page before he maketh us a very grave Diſcourſe,<note place="margin">The firſt point of <hi>Eleutherius</hi>'s Epiſtle.</note> 
                  <hi>How that</hi> Lucius <hi>ſent to</hi> Rome <hi>the ſecond time for a Copy of ſuch politic Orders as were then uſed in the Regiment of the Church; but that</hi> Eleutherius, <hi>for divers reaſons, thought it beſt not to lay any more upon the Necks of the New Converts of</hi> Britanny, <hi>than Chriſt and his Apoſtles had already ſet down to all men in the Scriptures.</hi> And is not this a wiſe Diſcourſe? as tho' no Temporal Laws were to be made in a Chriſtian Commonwealth, but only thoſe that are ſet down in Scriptures. Who ſeeth not the madneſs of theſe Concluſions or Illations? Nay, who doth not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how greatly this matter is againſt themſelves? That King <hi>Lucius</hi> dwelling ſo far off from <hi>Rome</hi> as he did; yea, being otherwiſe an Enemy to the <hi>Roman</hi> Nation, as theſe men confeſs that he was, did notwithſtanding ſo highly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, even in thoſe ancient days, the See and Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> that he ſubmitted himſelf thereto, and demanded from thence direction, not only in matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and Eccleſiaſtical Laws, but in Temporal and Civil alſo; and <hi>Eleutherius</hi> knowing his own Authority over him and his, doubted not to appoint them what was to be done. And albeit Mr. <hi>Jewell</hi> doth call it an Advice, as you have heard, yet the Title of the Epiſtle implieth more, ſaying, that it was <hi>ad corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionem Regis &amp; Procerum Regni,</hi> as above we have declared. And this for the firſt point contained in this Epiſtle.</p>

And doth not here the Apoſtle confeſs expreſly, that Temporal Lords and Princes, yea tho' they were Pagans, are Chriſt's Vicars and Subſtitutes in their Government of Temporal Affairs? But yet I do not think that either <hi>Fox</hi> or <hi>Holinſhead</hi> will ſay that they were Chriſt's Vicars alſo in Spiritual Affairs, or Heads of the Church within their Realms, as by this Epiſtle of <hi>Eleutherius</hi> they would make King <hi>Lucius</hi> ſeem to be.</p>

Secondly, for that neither <hi>Fox</hi> nor <hi>Holinſhead</hi> would deliver it unto us in <hi>Latin</hi> as it was written.

                  <hi>that it be as they would have it, (and indeed the moſt part of our</hi> Engliſh <hi>Stories do confeſs it) neither will I greatly ſtick with them therein: yet what have they got thereby, when they have caſt all their gain? In few words, to conclude this matter, if ſo be that the Chriſtian Faith and Religion was firſt derived from</hi> Rome <hi>by</hi> Eleutherius, <hi>let them but grant to us the ſame Faith and Religion that was taught in</hi> Rome, <hi>and from thence derived hither by</hi> Eleutherius, <hi>and we will deſire no more: For then was there not any <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Pope,</hi>

                  </note>2. Thus ſaith the <hi>Fox,</hi> granting by Teſtimony of moſt Writers that which before he laboured ſo much to impugn. Now let us hear the Cub, how well he hath learned to bark after his Sire: <hi>Tho' it be granted</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that</hi> Eleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therius <hi>ſending hither Preachers from</hi> Rome <hi>in King</hi> Lucius <hi>his time, did firſt convert this Land to the Chriſtian Faith; I ſay, there is not now the ſame Faith in</hi> Rome <hi>that was then: There were then no Maſſes ſaid, no Tranſubſtantiation known, no ſetting up of Images in Churches, no <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Pope,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Here you ſee the ſelf-ſame Speech, with the ſelf-ſame Spirit, betwixt the Cub and the Fox, the Scholar and the Maſter; but that the Scholar altereth ſomewhat the order, to cover thereby his borrowing from the other: Nay, we may note another thing alſo, which is uſual in ſuch people; the Scholar is more earneſt and eager than his Maſter of whom he took it, and more over-laſhing; ſo as what the one ſpeaketh but doubtfully, the other affirmeth moſt reſolutely; what the one ſaith, the other ſweareth. <hi>Let them grant us</hi> (ſaith <hi>Fox</hi>) <hi>the ſame Faith which was then at</hi> Rome, <hi>and we deſire no more.</hi> This was ſomewhat modeſt, tho' Falſe and Hypocritical; for he meaneth it not, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever you grant him, or prove againſt him. But what ſaith his Scholar? <hi>I
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:104638:28"/>
I ſay</hi> (quoth he) <hi>there is not now the ſame Faith in</hi> Rome <hi>that was then.</hi> This is more reſolute and peremptory as you ſee: For who ſaith it I pray you? <hi>I ſay it</hi> (quoth he) as tho he would challenge the field of him that will dare to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it, or prove the contrary. But who are you (Sir) that we ſhould yield unto you this Pythagorical Authority of <hi>ipſe dixit?</hi> granting all things upon your own Aſſertion without further proofs? if you be the Man that ſo often be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have been made a mouſe, and your Credit ſo many times ſhaken by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your falſe dealing, then may it be now an Argument rather to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: to wit, Sir <hi>Francis</hi> ſaith this or that without alledging any Proof, <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go</hi> it is probable that the matter is either feigned or falſified, and this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence you ſhall ſee much confirmed both in him and his Father <hi>Fox,</hi> by this that here we are to examin.</p>
               <p n="4">4. For firſt, both of them do affirm (as you have heard) and that with great Aſſeveration, that in the Time of <hi>Eleutherius</hi> the Pope, that is to ſay, in the ſecond Age after Chriſt, <hi>there was not the Faith in</hi> Rome <hi>that now is:</hi> For that there was no mention or knowledge then, <hi>either of any univerſal Authority of the Church or Biſhop of</hi> Rome, <hi>or of the name or uſe of Maſſes, or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice propitiatory, or of Tranſubſtantiation, or of Images uſed in Churches, and the like.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. To which vain Arguments of both theſe poor Men, I might anſwer ſufficiently, by telling them (if they will learn) that albeit it were true in ſome ſence, that theſe Doctrins, which here they alledge and ſome other in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie between us, were not found in the Second Age, when Pope <hi>Eleuthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> lived, ſo expreſly ſet forth, as in other Ages afterward, when better Occaſion was offered, and the Times did more permit the ſame: yet is this no good Argument to prove, that they were not believed then alſo in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic Church. For if this Conſequence ſhould be admitted, then as well might it be admitted alſo againſt many other principal Points and Articles of our Faith, which are acknowledged and believed by Proteſtants alſo at this day, tho not expreſly handled, diſcuſſed or determined in thoſe firſt two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years after Chriſt: as for Example, the Name and Doctrin of the <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Trinity, the two diſtinct Natures, and one Perſon in Chriſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Points of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly handled or determined by the Church within the firſt two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years.</note> 
                  <hi>his two diſtinct wills, the Virginity of our Bleſſed Lady both before and after her Child-birth, the Proceeding of the Holy Ghoſt, as well from the Son, as from the Father,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="6">6. All which Points and ſome others are not found to be handled ſo clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and diſtinctly by Authors of the firſt two hundred Years, as afterward, partly for that they were occupied in other matters againſt Gentiles and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks that touched not theſe Points and partly for that General Councils could not yet be gathered together, to diſcuſs and declare them diſtinctly; tho no good Chriſtians will or may doubt, but that they were believed in the Church before, from Chriſt downward, and that the General Councils that determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them afterward for Articles of true Belief againſt Heretics, that had cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them in queſtion, did not ſo determine them, as if they had made them Articles which were not before (for this the Church could not do, as is held by all Catholics) but only that they being Articles of True and Catholic Belief before, the Church did now declare them to be ſuch.</p>
               <p>Wherefore this being ſo, I might anſwer (and I ſee not how they could reply) that <hi>John Fox</hi> and his Scholar may as well deny and call in queſtion all or any of theſe foreſaid Articles, as the other, which they recite. For that they were as little, or perhaps leſs ſpecified in the firſt two hundred Years, than theſe which they object.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But I will deal more liberally with our Miniſter and Knight,<note place="margin">Two ways of Proof; the one negative, the other af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative.</note> and will ſeek to ſatisfie them with Reaſon, who do brabble and argue againſt us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Reaſon. I ſhall endeavour to do the ſame by two ways, hoping to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:104638:29"/>
make their Folly appear to every indifferent Man by them both. The firſt ſhall be <hi>via negativa,</hi> the negative way, by putting them to ſome proof. And the ſecond ſhall be affirmative, ſhewing them what Proofs may be brought for our ſide. Nothing doubting but that each ſhall be ſufficient to ſatisfie the equal Reader: Let the firſt kind of Argument then, by the way of negative, be this.</p>
               <p n="8">8. We deny that the Faith now held in <hi>Rome,</hi> and namely the Articles here mentioned of the <hi>Pope, Maſs, Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> and <hi>uſe of Images,</hi> were not believed in Pope <hi>Eleutherius</hi>'s days, as now for the ſubſtance of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin. And let them prove it if they can, and if they ſay, that it is hard to prove a negative, we are content that they prove only an affirmative, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the ſaid negative may be inferred, to wit, that any one of theſe Doctrins did begin to enter into the Church after <hi>Eleutherius.</hi> And to this Proof they are bound in all equity and reaſon, as we ſhall ſhew by our ſequent Diſcourſe. For if it be true, that the Articles and Points of Doctrin here mentioned by <hi>Fox</hi> and Sir <hi>Francis</hi> wherein they differ from us,<note place="margin">The firſt way of argument negative a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants.</note> be indeed not things heard of, or believed at <hi>Rome</hi> in the time of Pope <hi>Eleutherius</hi> (which yet they denie not, but that in other Ages after they were generally received) then followeth it, that <hi>Fox</hi> and his Fellows muſt ſhew the Time, Place, Men, and Occaſion of their beginning, to wit, when, where, and by what Men, and upon what Cauſes, and with what Authority, or Induction or Violence, or by what Deceit, or with what Contradiction of others, theſe Doctrins entred firſt, and were continued in the Church. All which Points we can ſhew of every other Error or Hereſie, that hath riſen and was held for ſuch, from Chriſt's Time to ours.</p>
               <p n="9">9. And if either <hi>Fox</hi> or his Cub, or any of that Kennel can or will ſhew this, and joyn iſſue with us upon this one Point, we do accept thereof, and the matter may be quickly diſpatch'd. But if this cannot be done, then muſt we follow the Rule of St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> held by him for infallible in ſuch Affairs:<note place="margin">The firſt ground of St. <hi>Auguſtins</hi> rule.</note> to wit, <q>That when any Doctrin is found generally received in the known viſible Churh, at any Time, or in any Age, whereof there is no certain Author, Time, or Beginning found: then is it ſure, that all ſuch Doctrin hath come down from Chriſt and his Apoſtles.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. This doth that holy Doctor and great Pillar of Gods Church Saint <hi>Auguſtin</hi> affirm and reiterate in every place of his Works againſt Heretics of his Time, which argued, as our Men do, by denying only, and putting Catholics to Proof. As for Example, againſt the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> denying the cuſtom of baptizing Infants, for that it was not in Scripture, nor recorded by Fathers of the firſt Ages,<note place="margin">Ang. l. <hi>4.</hi> de Bapt. cont. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat. c. <hi>6.</hi>
                  </note> Saint <hi>Auguſtin</hi> anſwereth thus, <hi>Illa conſuetudo, quam &amp; tunc homines ſurſum verſum aſpicientes non videbant à poſterioribus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutam, rectè ab Apoſtolis tradita creditur.</hi> 
                  <q>That Cuſtom of Baptizing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, which Men before us in the Church looking upward to Antiquity, did not find to have been ordained by them that came after the firſt Ages, is rightly believed to have been delivered by the Apoſtles.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. And again in another place ſpeaking of Eccleſiaſtical Cuſtoms, he ſaith, <hi>Quod univerſa tenet Eccleſia,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lib. <hi>4.</hi> de bapt. c. <hi>24.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>nec Conciliis inſtitutum ſed ſemper retentum eſt, non niſi anthoritate Apoſtolica traditum rectiſſimè creditur.</hi> 
                  <q>That, which the univerſal Church doth hold, and was not inſtituted by any Council, but hath been ſtill retained in the Church, this we may moſt juſtly believe to have come from no other Authority, than from the Apoſtles.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And the like Speeches unto this hath St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> in divers other places both of this Book againſt the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> as <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 7. and <hi>l.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 23. as alſo <hi>lib. de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitat. Eccleſiae. c.</hi> 19. <hi>&amp; Epiſtola</hi> 118, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And as for that he ſpeaketh of Inſtitution by Councils, he meaneth of Cuſtoms and Ceremonies, and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:104638:29"/>
not of Articles of Belief. Which no Council can appoint, but only declare and expound, as before we have ſhewed.</p>
               <p n="12">12. This Poſition then of St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> is moſt true and conſonant to the Doctrin of all other Fathers in that behalf, that when any thing is found ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally received in the Church, and no Author, Inſtitutor, or Beginning can be found thereof, this without all doubt cometh down from the Apoſtles. And of this poſition may be alledged two infallible grounds.<note place="margin">Two reaſons why that which is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally received in the Church and hath no known begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, may be preſumed to come from the Apoſtles <hi>Ioan.</hi> 14.15, 16. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.</note> The one of Faith, the other of evident Reaſons. For in Faith who can think ſo baſely of Chriſts Power or Will in performing his Promiſes made unto his Church, to conſerve her in all Truth unto the Worlds end, as that he ſhould permit her notwithſtanding to admit or teach generally any one falſe Article of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, and much leſs, ſo many as theſe men object againſt us? For whereas he promiſed his Holy Spirit to be with her unto the Worlds end, and that ſhe ſhould be the <hi>Pillar</hi> and <hi>Firmament</hi> of Truth to direct others, and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that <hi>hell gates ſhould never prevail againſt her:</hi> How ſhould all this be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, if ſhe fell into thoſe Errors, of which Proteſtants accuſe her? or what greater Victory could the gates of Hell have againſt her, than that from an Apoſtolical Church, of whom Chriſt ſpake, ſhe ſhould become an Apoſtatical Church, as theſe Men do call her? which is the greateſt Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy againſt Chriſt and his Divinity, that poſſibly can be imagined, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it doth evacuate his whole Incarnation, Life, Death, Doctrin, Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and other Benefits of his coming, which were all imployed to this end, to make unto himſelf a Church and Kingdom in this world, that ſhould direct Men in all Truth to their Salvation. And this being taken away, and the other granted, that the Church her ſelf may fall into Error and falſe Doctrin; then is there no certainty in any thing. And conſequently it cannot be that any erroneous Doctrin ſhould be taught or received general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the Church. And this is the firſt ground of St <hi>Auguſtin</hi>'s Aſſertion.</p>
               <p n="13">13. But beſides this, there is another founded in Reaſon and Experience,<note place="margin">The ſecond ground of St. <hi>Augustin</hi>'s rule.</note> which cannot be denied. And for that it is a conſideration of great Importance and may ſerve the Reader to many purpoſes of moment, for diſcerning of Doubts and Controverſies; I ſhall deſire him to be attent in peruſing the ſame. We do find by Experience, and that not only in Eccleſiaſtical, but Temporal Affairs alſo: That when Orders, Laws and Cuſtoms are once ſettled in any Common-wealth, it is hard to alter or take them away, or to bring in things oppoſite or different to them, without ſome Reſiſtance, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, Contradiction, or at leaſt ſome Memory thereof, how, why, and by whom it was done. As for Example, if a Man would go about to bring in any Innovation in the particular Laws of <hi>London,</hi> and much more in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Laws of all the Land: no doubt, but he ſhould find ſome Reſiſtance therein, ſome that would diſpute about the matter, alledging Reaſons to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: others would reſiſt and oppoſe themſelves; and when all did fail, at leaſtwiſe ſome Record, Story or Memory would be left of this Change.</p>
               <p n="14">14. But much more if this matter did concern Religion, which is moſt eſteemed above other Points. As for Example, if a Man would begin to teach any Points of Doctrin at this Day in <hi>England</hi> contrary or different from that which is there received, and eſtabliſhed by public Authority; he would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently be noted and contradicted by ſome no doubt: as we ſee the <hi>Puritans, Browniſts, Family of Love,</hi> and other ſuch newer Teachers have been, and the Hiſtory thereof is notorious, and will remain to Poſterity.</p>
               <p n="15">15. And this is the very reaſon alſo, why all Heretics and Hereſies from the beginning did no ſooner peep up in the viſible Catholic Church, but that they were noted, impugned confuted, and finally caſt out from that body, to the Devils dung-hill. And the Records thereof do remain, who were the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:104638:30"/>
Authors and Beginners, who the Favourers and ſetters forward, at what time, upon what occaſion, under what Popes and Kings, and other ſuch-like Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. And this will endure to the end of the World.</p>
               <p n="16">
                  <note place="margin">The proper ſtate of the Queſtion.</note>16. This then being ſo, we now come to the ſtate of our Queſtion, and to joyn with the Proteſtants upon this Iſſue, That ſeeing the Doctrins before mentioned, of the <hi>Popes Authority, Sacrifice of the Maſs, Tranſubſtantiation, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Images,</hi> and the like, were found to be generally received and believed in the Viſible and Univerſal Catholic Church of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> when <hi>Martin Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> firſt began to break from the ſame; yea, and many Ages before, by their own confeſſion, they muſt ſhew us when the ſaid Doctrins were brought in afterwards to the Church, not being there, nor believed therein before; to wit, by what Man or Men, with what Authority, Conſtraint, or Perſuaſion, with what repugnance of them that miſliked the ſame, and other like Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances before mentioned; which if they be not able to do, moſt certain it is, that whatſoever they prattle againſt theſe Doctrins, ſaying they were not in <hi>Eleutherius</hi>'s time, it is nothing but Cavils and Heretical Shifts.</p>
               <p n="17">17. And now that they cannot ſhew any ſuch particularities for the entrance or admittance of theſe Doctrins into the Church, is moſt evident: For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever time they aſſign for their beginning, we can ſtill ſhew, that before that time they were in uſe, if they mean of the Things themſelves, and not only of Words or Phraſes.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> ever in the Cath. Church.</note> As for example, when they object, That in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Lateran</hi> under Pope <hi>Innocentius</hi> III. in the year of Chriſt 1215. the word <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> was firſt uſed; we anſwer, That albeit that word was then added for better explication of the matter, as theſe words <hi>Homouſion, Conſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial, Trinity,</hi> and the like, were by the firſt General Council of <hi>Nice;</hi> yet the ſubſtance of the Article was held before, from the beginning, under other equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent words of <hi>Change and Immutation of Natures, Transformation of Elements,</hi> and the like. As for Example, that of St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſpeaking of the words of Chriſt in the Conſecration,<note place="margin">Amb. l. <hi>4.
5,</hi> &amp; <hi>9.</hi> de Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentis.</note> 
                  <hi>Non valebit ſermo Chriſti, ut ſpecies mutet elemento<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum?</hi> 
                  <q>Shall not the words of Chriſt be of power to change the Natures of Elements?— And again, <hi>Sermo Chriſti, qui potuit de nihilo facere, quod non erat, non poteſt ea quae ſunt in id mutare, quod non erant?</hi> "The Speech of Chriſt that was able to create of nothing that which was not before; ſhall it not be able to change things that are already into that which they were not before?</q> He meaneth the Bread and Wine into the Body and Blood of Chriſt, as himſelf doth expound.</p>
               <p n="18">18. So as here we ſee the change of the Natures of Elements, and of the Subſtance of one Body into another, averred by St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> long time before the Council of <hi>Lateran;</hi> which is the ſame that we mean by <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi> And conform to this do ſpeak alſo other ancient Fathers, as well <hi>Greek</hi> as <hi>Latin;</hi> and one thing is ſpecially to be noted, That both the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Church did agree therein in the ſaid Council; there being preſent two Patriarchs of the Greek Church,<note place="margin">The Council of <hi>Lateran</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Innocentius</hi> III. <hi>Anno</hi> 1215.</note> to wit, thoſe of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> and <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> and others both Archbiſhops, Biſhops, and Prelates: So as of both Churches the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops were 70, the Biſhops 412, Abbots and Priors 800, and Prelates in all 1215, together with the Legats, Doctors and Embaſſadors of both Empires, Weſt and Eaſt, as alſo of the Kings of <hi>France, Spain, England, Hieruſalem,</hi> and others. So as this point of Doctrin about <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> was not han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in corners, but publicly: and the Council doth not deliver the ſame as any New Doctrin, but only as an Explication of That which ever had been held before.</p>
               <p n="19">19. And the ſame is anſwered to the other-like Heretical Cavils about other points here objected by <hi>Fox</hi> and Sir <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Pope, the uſe of the Maſs, and Propitiatory Sacrifice, the ſetting up of dead Mens Images,</hi> and the like. For
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:104638:30"/>
if they underſtand by the firſt the Primacy and Supreme Authority Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical of the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> and her Biſhops; and by the ſecond, the Chriſtian external Sacrifice of the Body and Blood of our Savior, inſtituted by himſelf as the Complement of all other Sacrifices that went before; and by the third, Sacred Memories and Images of Chriſt and his Saints, that are not dead, but living and reigning everlaſtingly in Heaven: then are all theſe Doctrins (howſoever diſguiſed by Heretics with different words, to make them more odious) moſt true and Catholic Doctrins, and received in the Church from the beginning, and continued from the Apoſtles downward.</p>
               <p n="20">20. And albeit theſe People, to continue cavilling, do alledge divers times,<note place="margin">A ſilly ſhift of the Heretics.</note> that the firſt of theſe Articles, <hi>about the Popes Supremacy,</hi> did begin firſt under Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great and <hi>Phocas</hi> the Emperor, about the year of Chriſt 600; and that the laſt, <hi>about the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Images,</hi> was decreed in the ſecond General Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> about the year 700; and that the other of the <hi>Uſe of Maſs</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan by little and little they cannot tell when: yet is this all moſt ridiculous, and themſelves dare not ſtand to any certain time by them aſſigned; for that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently we appoint another time before that wherein theſe things were alſo acknowledged; which they cannot do in the Hereſies by us objected to them, for that we ſhew indeed the very true time wherein they began, and had their off-ſpring, together with the proper Authors, Places, Occaſions, and other-like particularities, recorded not by our ſelves, but by other authentical Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters before us, ſo as reaſonably there can be no doubt thereof. And herein ſtands the true difference between us: We really and ſubſtantially ſhew the Beginning and Authors of their Hereſies, for that they are Hereſies indeed; but They cannot ſhew the Beginning or Author of any of our Articles of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief ſince Chriſt and his Apoſtles, for that they are no Hereſies, but Catholic Doctrins, and have ever endured from Chriſt downward; tho' in ſome Ages more than other, they have been expounded or declared by Fathers and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, according to the neceſſities of the time; and this is one proper Office of the Holy Ghoſt, appointed for Guider of the Church to explain matters, as doubts do ariſe.</p>
               <p n="21">21. Wherefore this is the firſt way of trial whether the foreſaid Articles of the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, taught at this day, about <hi>Tranſubſtantiation, Maſs,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Inference upon all the former Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> and the like, be the ſame that Pope <hi>Eleutherius</hi> held, and ſent into <hi>Britanny,</hi> or not. And I do call all this kind of Argument <hi>Negative,</hi> both in reſpect of our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, that deny them to have been then in uſe, and of Us, that deny them to have been brought in afterward: And they ought to prove the ſecond, ſeeing they cannot deny but that they were once generally in uſe, and received over <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi> Whereof we do make the former moſt infallible Inference with St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> That foraſmuch as they were once in uſe, and generally received, and no particular beginning can be ſhewed of them or of their entrance: <hi>Ergo,</hi> They came from the Apoſtles themſelves.</p>
               <p n="22">22. To this Inference the Sectaries and Heretics of our time have one only ſhift more; which is, That albeit theſe Doctrins have for many Ages been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived generally in the Church of <hi>Chriſtendom;</hi> yet that they crept into the ſame by little and little, and finding no reſiſtance, began at laſt to be univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally believed. But this creeping Inſtance can have no place here by any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability: For, to ſay nothing of the Providence of God in protecting his Church from ſuch creeping Errors, nor yet of the Promiſes of Chriſt before-mentioned to the ſame effect,<note place="margin">That Hereſies could not creep into the Church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being eſpied.</note> Reaſon it ſelf doth demonſtrate alſo that this poſſibly could not be; For if the Doctors and Fathers of the Church did note and diſcover from time to time every leaſt Hereſie or Error that did peep up in their days, and this not only in Heretics, but in divers principal Fathers alſo that held any particular Opinions, as is manifeſt in St. <hi>Cyprian, Lactantius, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobius,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:104638:31"/>
Caſſianus,</hi> and others; If this diligence (I ſay) were uſed by them in all other occaſions, how could it happen that ſo many, ſo manifeſt, and ſo important Doctrins, as are in controverſie between Us and Proteſtants, ſhould be let paſs without Note or Contradiction, if they had been either New or Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous? How ſhould it come to paſs (I ſay) that no one of theſe ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſhould ever impugn any of theſe Doctrins, if they were New Opinions, and brought into the Church contrary to the Doctrin that was before, as theſe men do ſay? Yea, how ſhould it fall out that no one Record in the World ſhould be left by our Anceſtors, that at ſuch a time, by ſuch or ſuch occaſions, began the Doctrin <hi>of Purgatory, of Praying to Saints, of the Real Preſence, of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Images, of Maſs and Sacrifice, of ſeven Sacraments,</hi> and the like, that were not held in the Church before?</p>
               <p n="23">
                  <note place="margin">An experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> 23. And that this is impoſſible, may be ſhewed by this experimental Dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which now I will ſet down. Let us imagin that none of theſe Doctrins were in the firſt Age under the Apoſtles; and namely, that then there were but <hi>two Sacraments, no Purgatory</hi> at all, or any <hi>External Sacrifice</hi> held. We ask them concerning the ſecond Age, wherein <hi>Juſtinus, Polycarpus, Irenaeus, Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi> and <hi>Tertullian,</hi> were chief Teachers, whether theſe Doctrins were in this Age, or no? If they deny it, tho' we might prove the contrary out of their Works; yet, not to paſs from this firſt kind of Argument, we ask the like of the third Age, under <hi>Origen, Cyprian, Dionyſius Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drinus, Pamphilus, Arnobius,</hi> and the reſt? And if they deny of this Age alſo, that theſe Doctrins were not held by them, we go to the fourth Age, under <hi>Athanaſius, Hilarius, Optatus, Baſil, Nazianzen, Ambroſe, Hierom, Chryſoſtom, Epiphanius, Cyrillus:</hi> In whoſe Writings every where there is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all theſe Doctrins, as afterward in our ſecond Argument we ſhall ſhew out of the Proteſtants themſelves; and namely the <hi>Magdeburgians,</hi> that profeſs to note all.</p>
               <p n="24">24. Now then, I ask our Adverſaries touching this creeping Inſtance, how could theſe Doctrins ſo creep into the Catholic Viſible Church in this fourth Age for example, and be received ſo generally over all Nations, Countreys, and Kingdoms, by theſe principal Lights, Captains, Watchmen, and Guiders of the ſame, as no Note, Detection, Reſiſtance or Memory ſhould be left of any Doubt, Diſpute, or Oppoſition made againſt them? Is this likely? Is this poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible? Read all the Fathers Works over, and find, if you can, but one place wherein one Father did ever hitherto note another for holding <hi>Purgatory, Praying to Saints, believing the Real Preſence,</hi> or the like, as they did <hi>Cyprian</hi> (tho' otherwiſe a moſt Learned and Holy Man) for teaching Re-baptization of Heretics, and ſome other Fathers for other particular Opinions different from the Catholic Doctrin of that Age. Whereof we may infer, That they would have done the like alſo in theſe other points, if they had been held for new or erroneous in thoſe days.<note place="margin">A Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of much importance.</note> And hereof alſo may be inferred another Sequel or Obſervation of very great moment againſt our Heretics, That when ſoever any Doctrin is found in any of the ancient Fathers, which is not contradicted nor noted by any of the reſt as ſingular, that Doctrin is to be preſumed to be no particular Opinion of his, but rather the general of all the Church in his days; for that otherwiſe it would moſt certainly have been noted and impugned by others. Whereby it followeth, that one Doctor's Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Saying in matters of Controverſie not contradicted or noted by others, may ſometimes give a ſufficient Teſtimony of the whole Churches Sentence and Doctrin in thoſe days; which is a point very greatly to be conſidered.</p>
               <p n="25">
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:104638:31"/>25. But yet further, to all this may be added another Conſideration of no ſmall weight, which is the difficulty of bringing in certain Doctrins,<note place="margin">The difficulty of bringing in five new Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.</note> if any man would have attempted it; as for Example, the Doctrin of <hi>Seven Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:</hi> If there had been but <hi>Two</hi> only before in the Apoſtles time, it had been an extreme great Novelty to have added <hi>Five</hi> more, which never would have been admitted without much ſtrife and reſiſtance, ſeeing all Catholics do hold, that Chriſt only could inſtitute Sacraments, for that He only could aſſure the Promiſe of Grace made thereunto, as excellently doth declare the Council of <note n="*" place="margin">Seſſ. <hi>7.</hi> cap. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Trent,</hi> and long before that again the <hi>Maſter of Sentences;</hi> and <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>4</hi> diſt. <hi>5.</hi> q. <hi>10</hi> art. <hi>2.</hi> &amp; part. <hi>3.</hi> q. <hi>64.</hi> act. <hi>4.</hi>
                  </note> St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> in the name of all Catholics, did leave that Doctrin regiſtred, and there can be no doubt thereof.</p>
               <p n="26">26. Wherefore this Truth being admitted, That the whole Church hath no Authority to inſtitute any Sacrament, or to alter any thing about the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial parts thereof; to wit, the Matter, Form, or Number, (as the ſame Council of <hi>Trent</hi> in another place declareth;<note place="margin">Seſſ. <hi>21.</hi> c. <hi>7.</hi>
                  </note>) how was it poſſible that five whole Sacraments ſhould be added or brought into Catholic Doctrin, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and believed throughout <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> without any reſiſtance or oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at all, if there had been but two only inſtituted by Chriſt, and exerciſed by the Apoſtles in the firſt Age? How, I ſay, could five more be brought in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward? By whom? at what time? in what Countrey? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Impoſſibilities</hi>
                  </note> For if any one had begun to do it, others would have reſiſted; it being a matter of ſo high moment. And if one Countrey, Province or Church had admitted them, another would have refuſed; or at leaſtwiſe there would have been ſome Doubt or Diſputation, and ſome general Meeting and Synod, or Council ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered about that matter; and ſome parts would have admitted <hi>one</hi> Number, and ſome <hi>another,</hi> as we ſee that the Sectaries of our time have done ſince the matter hath been called in queſtion by them; ſome allowing <hi>five,</hi> ſome <hi>four,</hi> ſome <hi>three,</hi> ſome <hi>two.</hi> But no memory of any of theſe differences being to be found among Catholics, moſt certain it is that <hi>this Number</hi> came down from Chriſt and his Apoſtles themſelves.</p>
               <p n="27">27. The like, or greater difficulty,<note place="margin">The difficulty of bringing in the uſe of Confeſſion.</note> would alſo have been about the uſe of Sacramental Confeſſion, if it had not been appointed by Chriſt, and put in ure preſently, and ſo continued from time to time: For that it being a thing in it ſelf moſt repugnant to man's ſenſual Nature, to be bound to open his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſins to another, with that Humility and Subjection which Catholic Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin doth preſcribe in the uſe of that Sacrament; clear it is, that if it had not been in ure even from the Apoſtles time, and that as a matter of abſolute neceſſity, it could never have been received afterward, nor yet brought in by any Human Power, Art, or Device. For who (I pray you) ſhould or could bring in ſuch a thing of ſo great repugnance and difficulty upon the whole Chriſtian Church? Will they ſay any Pope? Let them name either Him or Them, together with the Time, and other Particularities; which they never will be able to do.</p>
               <p n="28">28. Beſides this, I ask them further, What Pope would ever have attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted this, if it had not been by Obligation before him; ſeeing that Popes themſelves, the more Great and Eminent they be above others, the more na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural repugnance muſt they needs find in themſelves, to go and kneel down at the feet of an inferior Prieſt, and confeſs unto him their moſt ſecret ſins? And the like may be ſaid of Temporal Princes and Emperours; who if any Pope or Power Eccleſiaſtical would have laid ſuch a burthen upon them, not uſed nor of obligation before, how would they have yielded unto it? which of them would not have anſwered, that ſeeing their Fathers and Anceſtors were ſaved without this ſubjection, and irkſom obligation of revealing their particular ſins, they would hope to be ſo alſo? And finally, ſome great Difficulty, Doubt,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:104638:32"/>
or Contention would have been about this matter, before it could have been ſo brought in, and eſtabliſhed all over the Chriſtian World, as we ſee by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence it was; and at leaſtwiſe ſome memory would have remained thereof in Hiſtories, which we find not, and conſequently we may conclude that there was never any ſuch thing. And this is ſufficient for our firſt Argument. Now let us paſs to the ſecond.</p>

                  <p>It is proved by the ſecond kind of <hi>Affirmative</hi> or <hi>Poſitive</hi> Arguments, That the Points of Catholic Doctrin, before denied by <hi>Fox</hi> and Sir <hi>Francis,</hi> were in uſe in Pope <hi>Eleutherius</hi> his Time, and in other Ages im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately following; and this by Teſtimony of <hi>Proteſtant Writers</hi> themſelves.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>ALbeit the Reaſons and Conſiderations before alledged, whereby our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries are willed to ſhew the beginning of ſuch Articles and Points of our Catholic Doctrin as they deny to have come down from the Apoſtles Time, were ſufficient to put them to ſilence, being not able to perform any part thereof, and conſequently alſo may open the eyes of any ſtudious Reader to ſee the Infirmity of Their Cauſe, and the Strength and Truth of Ours; yet will we, for greater ſatisfaction of all ſorts, paſs over to the other part alſo of <hi>Poſitive</hi> and <hi>Affirmative</hi> Proofs, which are ſo abundant in this behalf, as if I would ſet them down all, this only point would require a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Treatiſe; wherefore I mean to abreviate the matter, as much as I may.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <note place="margin">Two means of proofs by ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Authors.</note>2.

For if I ſhould cite the places, as for Example in the ſecond Age, St. <hi>Irenaeus lib.</hi> 5. <hi>adverſ. haereſ.</hi> for the Supremacy of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the ſame, <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 77. and with him <hi>Juſtinus Martyr, q.</hi> 103. together with <hi>Theophilus, Athenagoras, Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi> for Freewill, and the ſame <hi>Clemens, lib.</hi> 5. <hi>ſtromatum,</hi> and divers others of that Age, for the Merit of Good Works, for the manner of doing Penance, and the like; and if I ſhould alledge the ſaid <hi>Irenaeus, lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 32. for the Sacrifice of the Maſs, and <hi>Juſtinus Martyr Apolog.</hi> 2. and <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus, lib.</hi> 7. <hi>Stromatum,</hi> about the Rites and Ceremonies of the ſaid Maſs, and the ſame <hi>Juſtinus, q.</hi> 136. and the ſame <hi>Irenaeus, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 18. for the Ceremonies of Baptiſm and Chriſm uſed in thoſe days: If (I ſay) I ſhould alledge theſe, and other Authors of that time, for poſitive Proofs of Catholic Articles againſt Proteſtants in <hi>Eleutherius</hi>'s days, the matter would firſt grow to be very long; for that I muſt alledge the places at length, ſeeing that otherwiſe the quarrelling Adverſary would ſay that I left out the Antecedents and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequents,<note place="margin">Ordinary ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villation of the Adverſary.</note> as themſelves are wont to do, when they mean not to have any Text rightly underſtood; Secondly, they would quarrel with us (when they ſee themſelves preſt) about the Authors Books, whether they be truly theirs or no; and thirdly, about the Tranſlation, Words, and Senſe.

                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:104638:32"/>3. But now finding that certain Authors of their own Religion, (if they be of their Religion) I mean the <hi>Magdeburgians,</hi> called otherwiſe <hi>Centuriatores,</hi> have taken upon them to ſet down the whole Story of the Church, and have herewithal treated as well of the Doctrin, as alſo the Doctors of every Age; I have thought beſt to take my Proofs out of them, being Confeſſions, as it were, againſt themſelves and their Mates the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> (tho' not very friendly Mates in many matters of Doctrin, as you ſhall hear) and their Story being the very Ground and Fountain of all <hi>John Fox</hi> his Volume of <hi>Acts and Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> except only thoſe things which concern <hi>England</hi> in particular; wherein whether he or they behave themſelves with leſs Honeſty or Conſcience, is hard to ſay: but in this Treatiſe you ſhall have divers taſts of them both.

But amongſt other points eſpecially to be noted to our purpoſe, that preſently after the Apoſtles in the ſecond Century, they make this Chapter, repeating the ſame in every Age after: <hi>Inclinatio Doctrinae,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A proud title againſt the Fathers Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.</note>

               <p n="5">5. This is the Title of this Chapter in every Age, and thoſe laſt words ſeem to be added, thereby to inſinuate to the Reader that the ſaid Doctors inwardly did hold perhaps many more Errors, and Straw-opinions, in theſe mens judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, than they left openly in writing. And by this arrogant Title you may ſee theſe four good Fellows mean to judge and cenſure all from the beginning of Chriſtian Religion unto their days; and among others they will cenſure <hi>John Fox</hi> alſo, and his Fellows, as you may ſee in the Preface of one of their Centuries, dedicated unto the Queen of <hi>England</hi> the third year of her Reign, 1560, where having told her Majeſty a long Tale of the Goſpel and pure Word of God, naming the ſame above half a hundred times (if I have counted right) in this one Epiſtle, and ſhewing how Princes muſt have no other Rule of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment than the ſaid Word (but yet underſtood as theſe men will interpret it) they tell her alſo, that they now do bring her Antiquity to look upon, yet complaining that few in ancient Times did write <hi>luculenter, &amp; cum judicio,</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>The ſame Argument is continued, and it is ſhewed out of the <hi>Magdeburgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> how they accuſe and abuſe the Fathers of the Second and Third Age, for holding with Us againſt Them.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>DIvers are the ſhifts and frauds, and manifold the abuſes, which Proteſtant Writers, and namely the <hi>Magdeburgians,</hi> do offer to the ancient Fathers,<note place="margin">Three manner of fraudulent ſhifts in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crediting the Fathers.</note> in examining their Sentences about Controverſies in Religion: Whereof one principal may be accounted, that of four or five places, or more, that may be alledged out of them for Us and our Doctrin, in the queſtion propoſed, they will not cite two, left the multitude of Authorities (if they alledge all that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> in the Fathers are found) ſhould give our Cauſe too much credit. Secondly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> of four or five parts of the Fathers words, contained in the places by them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, theſe good Fellows do cut off ordinarily three, leſt if they did ſet them down at length, with their Antecedents, and Conſequents, their Opinions might appear more probable and plauſible than theſe men would have them: And of this you have had an Example in the firſt Authority alledged by me even now out of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> about the Principality of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> which being ſet down ſomewhat at length, as it is in the Author, maketh the matter clear; but ſhuffled up in four or five words, after a moſt cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail'd manner (as the <hi>Magdeburgians</hi> do alledge them) do ſcarce make any ſenſe at all: which is the thing the Alledgers do deſire, thereby to diſcredit the Author.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Their third fraud is, that having alledged the firſt Authorities for Us,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> and againſt themſelves, they deviſe divers pretty and witty ſlights to diſcredit them again; as ſometimes ſaying, that in other places the ſaid Father expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth or contradicteth himſelf; ſometimes, that he ſpeaketh raſhly, or incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiouſly, or without Scripture, and other ſuch contemptuous rejections. As for Example, talking of St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> that famous Biſhop, Doctor, and Martyr, and the Chriſtian Phoenix of his Age (as St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> judgeth of him) theſe men do handle him in this ſort.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Cyprianus <hi>ſine Scriptura loquitur, Cyprian</hi> ſpeaketh without Scripture;<note place="margin">Cent. <hi>3.</hi> c. <hi>4.</hi>
                  </note> Cyprianus <hi>ſuperſtitiosè fingit, Cyprian</hi> doth feign ſuperſtitiouſly; Cyprianus <hi>malè judicat, Cyprian</hi> judgeth naughtily, and the like. Nay, they endeavor to diſcredit the whole multitude of Doctors and Fathers in every Age: As for Example, in the beginning of the firſt Age next after the Apoſtles, they write thus: <hi>Tameſit haec aetas Apoſtolis admodum vicina fuit,</hi> &amp;c.<note place="margin">

                  </note> 
                  <hi>Albeit this Age wus neareſt to the Apoſtles, yet the Doctrin of Chriſt and his Apoſtles began to be not a little darkened therein, and many monſtrous and incommodious Opinions are every-where found to be ſpread by the Doctors thereof. Perhaps ſome cauſe hereof might be, for that the Gift of the Holy Ghoſt in theſe Doctors, did begin to decay, for the ingratitude of the World towards the Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Lo here what a Preface this is, to make contemptible to the Reader all the Fathers of the very firſt Age after the Apoſtles!

                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:104638:35"/>5. And this is now ſpoken by them by way of prevention, to diſcredit ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally the Fathers of theſe firſt Ages, when they ſay any thing againſt them: But when they come to particulars,<note place="margin">

               <p n="24">24. And as for her Majeſties time that now is, clear it is that neither of both the former Doctrins or Goſpels have formally, or fully been admitted: I mean neither the <hi>Lutherans</hi> or <hi>Zwinglians,</hi>

And yet he goeth further: <hi>Deſperatiùs errant, quo non ab Apoſtolis, vel Apoſtolorum ſucceſſoribus, ſed à Tyrannis,</hi>

               <p n="17">17. Here you ſee that Prieſthood in thoſe days was not wont to be given by the Authority of Lay Princes, but by the Succeſſors of the Apoſtles, to wit, Biſhops.

                  </note> 
                  <q>There was a Church near to the City on the Eaſt ſide, built in old time in the honor of St. <hi>Martin,</hi> while yet the <hi>Romans</hi> did hold <hi>Brittany, &amp;c.</hi> Wherefore in this Church, <hi>Auguſtin</hi> and his company did firſt uſe to meet together, to ſing Pſalms, to Pray, to ſay Maſſes, to preach, and to baptize the People, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

been different in any one Point of Faith; but alſo the ſame is clear, as well by their own Writings that are extant, and by their Lives written by others, as alſo by divers things recounted by St. <hi>Bede</hi> in his Story of their Doings in <hi>England:</hi> as namely where he writeth of St. <hi>German,</hi> how he cured the <hi>Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> Daughter of Blindneſs by his Prayer,<note place="margin">Relics of Saints. <hi>Ibid. c.</hi> 18.</note> and by applying the Relics of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Saints unto her Eyes in the ſight of all the People. <hi>Deinde</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Germanus plenus Spiritu ſancto;</hi> &amp;c. <q>Then St. <hi>German</hi> full of the Holy Ghoſt, did invoke the Name of the Bleſſed Trinity, and preſently took from his ſide a certain Box of <hi>Saints</hi> Relics, that he was wont to carry about his neck, and with his hands did put them upon the maids eyes, which out of hand received perfect ſight therewith.

                  </note> and much praiſed both by <hi>Fox</hi> and <hi>Bale,</hi> as true Teachers in thoſe days, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Fox</hi> writeth thus: <q>In this Age (to wit after the Peace reſtored to the Church by <hi>Conſtantine</hi>) followed here in the land of <hi>Britanny; Faſtidius, Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianus, Patricius, Bacchiarius, Dubritius, Congellus, Kentegernus, Helmotus, David, Daniel, Sampſon, Elnodugus, Aſſaphus, Gildas, Henlanus, Elbodus, Dinothus, Samuel, Nivius,</hi> and a great ſort more, which governed the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> Church by Chriſtian Doctrin a long ſeaſon: albeit the civil Governours for the time were diſſolute and careleſs, (as <hi>Gildas</hi> very ſharply doth lay to their Charge) and ſo at length were ſubdued by the <hi>Saxons.</hi> And all this while about the ſpace of 400 years (to wit from the time of King <hi>Lucius</hi>) Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion remained in <hi>Britanny</hi> uncorrupt, and the word of Chriſt truly preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, until about the coming of St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> and his Companions from <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. Here now you ſee the chief Teachers of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Church (Nineteen in number) for the ſpace of 400 years (as <hi>Fox</hi> avoweth) ſet down in order, and highly praiſed by him; but neither his Order or Argument is worth a ruſh.<note place="margin">Neither Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der nor Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument good in <hi>Fox.</hi>

And for his Argument, how many lies and errors it containeth, ſhall eaſily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by the Sequel of this Diſcourſe. For firſt concerning two of the chief in this Catalogue contained, (to wit, <hi>Dubritius</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> Archbiſhops of the <hi>Britans</hi>) you have ſeen before, that they were <hi>Roman</hi> Catholics and canonized many Ages after their Death by <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhops, which they would never have

done, if they had differed from them in any Point of Religion. But now let us ſee of the reſt, for I ſee not what reaſon there is, why <hi>Fox</hi> ſhould ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend theſe two.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The Deduction of the aforeſaid Catholic <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, planted in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> by St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> from his time to our days; And that from King <hi>Ethelbert,</hi> who firſt received the ſame unto King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. there was never any public interruption of the ſaid Religion in our Land.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>HAving ſhewed before, how that the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholic Faith was firſt preached in our Iſland under the Apoſtles, and then again in the next Age under Pope <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> and thirdly four Ages after that again under Pope <hi>Gregory;</hi> and that all this was but one and the ſelf-ſame Religion, continued, renewed, and revived in divers times, under divers States and People of the Realm; there may ſeem to remain only now two other points conſiderable in this affair: The firſt, Whether this Religion brought in by St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> to <hi>England</hi> were held at that day for the only true Religion of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> and ſo accepted by all the World? The other, Whether that Religion then planted hath come down, and been continued in <hi>England</hi> ever ſince, by continual Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, until the firſt public alteration made thereof in our days? For if this be ſo, then is the demonſtration eaſie to be made even from the Apoſtles Times to Ours.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And for the firſt, tho' we have handled the ſame ſomewhat before,<note place="margin">That the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion brought in by St. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> was Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic.</note> yet briefly we will add now, That there can be no doubt at all in this matter with men of Reaſon and Judgment, but that St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> and his Fellows brought in with them the whole Body of Religion, as well touching Articles of Belief, as Ceremonies, and Eccleſiaſtical Cuſtoms, which were at that time in uſe at <hi>Rome</hi> whence they came, and in other Catholic Countreys by which they paſſed, namely, <hi>Italy, France,</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Greg. in epiſt ad Aug.</note> from which Countreys Pope <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> himſelf exhorteth them by his Letters to take ſuch good Eccleſiaſtical Uſes as they ſhould ſee moſt agreeable to Piety, Edification, and Devotion; which is a ſign that all thoſe Countreys agreed fully in Faith and Belief with <hi>Rome</hi> at that day, and were perfectly Catholic, tho' in ſome external Ceremonies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to Devotion there might be difference. And foraſmuch as the <hi>French</hi> Biſhops St. <hi>German,</hi> St. <hi>Lupus,</hi> and St. <hi>Severus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Bed. l. <hi>1.</hi> hist. c. <hi>18, 19, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> 150 years (as hath been ſaid) before the entrance of St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> planted in <hi>Britanny</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Catholic Faith againſt the <hi>Pelagians;</hi> and theſe men coming from <hi>Rome,</hi> found no fault therewith, moſt certain it is that all was one. And finally if we do conſider the Works, Writings and Actions of Pope <hi>Gregory,</hi> related by us before, partly out of St. <hi>Iſidore,</hi> living at that time in <hi>Spain,</hi> partly out of his own Epiſtles yet extant, written to the chiefeſt Biſhops of the Chriſtian World, and their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to him again, together with their agreement in Faith and Religion. If we do conſider alſo the Hereſies condemned in his days by Him and his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as the <hi>Eutychians, Monothelites,</hi> and others, which our Proteſtants alſo do condemn for Hereſies at this day. By all this (I ſay) and by infinite other Arguments and Demonſtrations that may be made, it is moſt evident, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſt had no Viſible Church or Catholic Religion in thoſe days,<note place="margin">Either no true Church or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was in St. <hi>Gregory</hi>'s time, or elſe it was the <hi>Roman.</hi>
                  </note> (which were moſt fooliſh and wicked to imagin) or that the Religion of St. <hi>Gregory</hi> and his Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and others of others of the ſame Communion, was in that Age the only true Catholic Church, and conſequently had in it the only true Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Faith and Religion of Chriſt whereby Chriſtians might be ſaved; which alſo is proved moſt evidently by infinit Miracles wrought in <hi>England,</hi> and in
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:104638:47"/>
divers other Countreys, upon manifold occaſions, during this time of our Primitive Church, as ſhall appear more in particular in the deduction of our ſecond point; which is the continuance of this ſame Religion from St. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> to <hi>Thomas Cranmer,</hi> the firſt and laſt Archbiſhops of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> following by Succeſſion the one the other for the ſpace of above 900 years; the <hi>firſt</hi> dying a <hi>Saint,</hi> the <hi>laſt</hi> ending in <hi>Apoſtacy,</hi> as after ſhall be ſhewed.</p>

And this Faith being once planted, did take ſuch deep Root by the ſaid watering of Chriſt the Author thereof, as it continued and held out from time to time, through all difficulties and differences both of times, Men, and State, and by Peril, Diviſions, Enmities, and cruel Wars, that fell out every day between thoſe Seven Kingdoms, until they were united all under one Monarchy ſome 200 years after; to wit, under King <hi>Egbert,</hi> King of the Weſt-Saxons. And from him again the ſame indured other 200 years unto King <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor before the Conqueſt.</p>
               <p n="17">17. And that which is worthy alſo the noteing in this caſe, is, that during the time of all this Enmity, Emulation, Suſpicions, Jealouſie of Kingdoms and States, and Bloody Battels between theſe Kingdoms for the ſpace of the foreſaid 200 years, from their Converſion to Chriſtianity until they came to be a Monarchy:<note place="margin">One Catholic Religion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der States that were enemies.</note> They all lived under one Arch-biſhop and Primate of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> holding their due ſubordination and good correſpondence with him, and by him with the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> and other Catholic Countries for matters of Faith and Eccleſiaſtical Affairs, no otherwiſe than if they had been all Friends, yea Subjects and Provinces of one and the ſelf ſame Kingdom, and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:104638:48"/>
this is the vertue and force of Catholic Union. Whereas amongſt Sectaries, every little difference of Temporal States, (yea of Towns, Cities, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments) doth preſently cauſe a diverſity alſo in Faith and Religion.<note place="margin">Diverſity of States work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth diverſity of Religion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</note> As we ſee at this day, that <hi>Saxony</hi> (for example) where the name of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants firſt began, being under a different Prince hath a great difference alſo in Religion from other parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> that call themſelves Proteſtants, and the Kingdoms of <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Swedeland,</hi> tho' they profeſs all Lutheraniſm, yet is the manner ſo different in theſe different States, as not only the one will not depend of the other in any ſort of ſubordination or Eccleſiaſtical Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction (as in <hi>England</hi> we ſee they did) but neither do they agree in any one Form of Religion, or ſubſtance of belief in all points, no nor in one ſtate it ſelf, where all profeſs themſelves to be Lutherans, as in <hi>Saxony,</hi> where the higher Saxons allow only rigid or ſtreight Lutherans: But the lower <hi>Saxony</hi> alloweth only the ſofter ſort, and expelleth the rigid or ſevere Lutherans; as the other do them, where they get Dominion.</p>
               <p n="18">18. <hi>Geneva</hi> and <hi>Berne</hi> are both Cities and States of the <hi>Switzers,</hi> and both of them profeſs Proteſtancy, tho' not according to <hi>Luthers</hi> Doctrin. But yet the Temporal State of the ſaid two Towns being different, the Magiſtrates have appointed a different and diſtinct Form.

                  <p>How Catholic Religion hath continued and perſevered in <hi>England</hi> during the times and Reigns of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth and his three Children, King <hi>Edward,</hi> Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> notwithſtanding all the troubles, changes, alterations and tribulations that have fallen out, and that the ſame Religion is like to continue to the Worlds end, if our ſins hinder not.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE deduction which we have hitherto made of Catholic Religion from our firſt Converſion, under St. <hi>Gregory</hi> and King <hi>Ethelbert</hi> of <hi>Kent,</hi>

                  </note> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to ſhew, that albeit in the external Face and Form of Religion, there have been divers Mutations, as Tempeſtuous Winds and Storms for the preſent, yet hath the Catholic Religion held firm her continuance throughout all theſe
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:104638:51"/>
Tempeſts, yea ſhewed her ſelf more clear, eminent and notorious by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of her moſt conſtant Members, then ſhe did before in peace, which is the proper privilege and excellency of truth,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. The Catholic faith groweth by perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, and hereſie is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown.</note> and of the Catholic Church (that is the Pilar of Truth) above all Sects and Hereſies (as St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and other Fathers do note) to come out of Perſecution, as Gold out of Fire more bright, illuſtrious, and eminent than before, or as an excellent Ship well Tackled and skilfully guided, breaketh thorow the Waves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hurt at all.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And this hath been proved now by the experience of 1600 years, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this Ship of the Catholic Church hath paſſed thorow no fewer ſtorms than there are years and overcome them all; whereas many hundred Sects and Sectaries in the meane ſpace have been broken in pieces, periſhed and conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, either by diviſion among themſelves, or with a little externe Perſecution or Diſcipline of the Church, whereof I ſhall not need to alledge many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, for that the World is full of them, and all Hiſtories do teſtifie, and our former deduction hath made it clear, and one Domeſtical example of our own days there is before our eyes, which may ſerve for all the reſt, to wit, that ſome ſeverity being begun by our State againſt two oppoſite Religions in <hi>England,</hi> the Catholics and Puritans, (tho' much more rigorous againſt the former than the ſecond) yet hath Catholic Religion increaſed thereby, and Puritaniſm been broken and in a manner diſſolved. The Reaſon of which different ſucceſs we ſhall touch afterwards. Now to the purpoſe we have in hand.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For the firſt Twenty years of King <hi>Henries</hi> Reign unto the year of Chriſt 1530 no Man can deny, but that the integrity of Catholic Religion, Union and Communion with the reſt of Chriſtendom, and perfect ſubordination to the See Apoſtolic of <hi>Rome</hi> remained in <hi>England</hi> whole, as the ſaid King had received it from the moſt prudent, Religious, and Victorious Prince his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, and he again from his renowned Anceſtors, whom yet King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth as he did excel in knowledge of Learning, So was he nothing inferior to them in zeal of defending the purity of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Faith, as may appear by the multitude of Sectaries and Heretics as well <hi>Waldenſians,</hi>

So wrote that honeſt man, ſignifying that King <hi>Henry</hi> was reſolved to make an outward ſhew in favouring the Goſpellers, not for love or liking he had of them, but to revenge himſelf of the Pope, and to enjoy the Goods of Monaſteries, and other ſpiritual Livings, which he, in his blaſphemous heretical vein, calleth <hi>the Whores fleſh, and marrow of her bones.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. Well then, this was the beginning of their Goſpel in <hi>England,</hi> by their own Confeſſion and Interpretation; and ſo whatſoever was done from this year forward, againſt Catholics or Catholic Religion, unto the 31ſt year of his Reign, which was of Chriſt 1540, to wit, for five whole years, was upon theſe grounds, and to the former ends of Revenge and Intereſt, if we believe Proteſtants themſelves; in which point notwithſtanding, for that divers God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Learned and Zealous men could not be content to follow the King's affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as others did, and namely Biſhop <hi>Fiſher</hi> of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas More</hi> late Chancellor of <hi>England,</hi> and divers moſt Reverend and Venerable Abbots, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, and Doctors, and other their like, they were content to give their Blood in defence of Catholic Unity againſt this Schiſm, as the Abbots of <hi>Glaſtenbury,</hi> of <hi>Whaley,</hi> of <hi>Reading,</hi> Dr. <hi>Foreſt</hi> Queen <hi>Catharine</hi>'s Confeſſor, Dr. <hi>Powel,</hi> and the like.</p>

Some others, and amongſt them one moſt near to the King himſelf both in Blood and Affection, namely Cardinal <hi>Pool,</hi> oppoſed himſelf by public Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from <hi>Padua,</hi> as we may ſee by thoſe three learned Books left by him in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, <hi>De Unitate Eccleſiae.</hi> Others alſo of the ſame Blood-Royal, as the Marqueſs of <hi>Exceter,</hi> and Counteſs of <hi>Salisbury</hi> (the ſaid Cardinal's Mother) ſhewed their diſlike, which afterwards was the cauſe of their ruin; and many Shires alſo of the Realm at this time, not being ſo patient as to bear theſe Innovations, took Arms, and fell into great Commotions, as in <hi>Lincolnſhire, Yorkſhire, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſetſhire,</hi> and ſome other Provinces, making all their Quarrels for matters of Religion.</p>
               <p n="13">13. So as by this we ſee that Catholic Religion remained ſtill in <hi>England</hi> both in Prince and People, but that the Prince for a time thought good for other ends to tolerate and wink at diſorders therein, until the aforeſaid year of 1540; when calling all his Realm together both Spiritual and Temporal to examin well this matter of Religion, they decreed that famous Statute both in Parliament and Conſiſtory Eccleſiaſtical, called <hi>the Statute of ſix Articles,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Statute of ſix Articles, <hi>An.</hi> 1540.</note> or as <hi>John Fox</hi> nameth it, <hi>the whip with ſix ſtrings or laſhes,</hi> in which Decree are condemned for deteſtable Hereſies all the moſt ſubſtantial points of Proteſtants Doctrin, eſpecially of <hi>Zwinglians</hi> and <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> and moſt ſevere puniſhment of Death appointed unto the Defenders and Maintainers thereof, whereby the Catholic Judgment and Cenſure of the whole Realm in that behalf was ſeen, and the King himſelf made further declaration thereof preſently for his own part, by putting away his <hi>German</hi> Wife <hi>Anne of Cleve,</hi> by which the Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers had thought to have drawn him further into League and Religion with the Proteſtant <hi>German</hi> Princes, and by puniſhing <hi>Cromwell,</hi> the Head and Fountain of moſt of theſe Innovations, by the loſs of his Head.<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p n="14">14. All theſe demonſtrations I ſay King <hi>Henry</hi> made this year of his Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Opinion and Judgment in all points, except in matter of Supremacy, which was his own Intereſt. And for the other ſix years which he lived afterwards, he vary'd not from this, but rather confirm'd the ſame, as we may ſee by his burning of <hi>Anne Askew</hi> for denying the Real Preſence in the Sacrament, not many months before his death; and by his own hearing of Maſs in his bed, and receiving the bleſſed Sacrament on his knees when he was not able to ſtand on his feet; but eſpecially by that which Biſhop <hi>Gardiner</hi> teſtified while he lived, and preached the ſame in a public Sermon at <hi>Paul's Croſs,</hi> that the ſaid King not long before his dying day, when he ſent him Embaſſador to a Diet in <hi>Germany,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">K. <hi>Henry</hi> gave Commiſſion for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation with <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </note> gave him ſpecial Commiſſion in ſecret to procure by the means of ſome Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Princes, and of the Pope's Legat and Nuntio there, ſome honorable conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for his Majeſty's reconciliation with the Pope and See of <hi>Rome</hi> again; which tho' God of his ſecret Judgment permitted him not to effectuate by the ſhortneſs of his life, yet appeareth it by this what his ſenſe in matters of Religion was.</p>
               <p n="15">15. So then now we have that Catholic Church and Religion continued in <hi>England</hi> during King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Reign, both in Prince and People, tho' much tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moil'd by Faction, Schiſms, and Hereſie, wherein notwithſtanding ſhe no more loſt her poſſeſſion and continuance, than ſhe did in time of the raging <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Donatiſts,</hi> or other Sectaries that prevailed in power for the preſent time, either generally, or in ſome particular Provinces, as <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Zwinglians</hi> alſo did in King <hi>Henry</hi>'s days in divers places, or do at this day, which yet was and is ſo, as they are eaſily diſtinguiſhed from the other, not only by the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Differences among themſelves, but alſo for that the Union of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:104638:53"/>
Religion doth ever ſhew it ſelf in ſome Regions adjoyning; yea com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly alſo even in thoſe very places where theſe Sects do range and bear moſt rule, ſome Catholics do remain to contradict them openly, and to plead for their old poſſeſſion;<note place="margin">Catholics in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by Perſecution.</note> and the greater the Perſecution is, the greater and more eminent is this Catholic contradicting part ſtirred up and increaſed by the very Power and Vertue of the Croſs of Chriſt in Perſecution, as before hath been noted.</p>
               <p n="16">16. And this was the ſtate of Catholic Religion in King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Reign; to wit, that it was held and defended publicly, except only the Article of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Supremacy denied to the Pope, whereunto notwithſtanding many thouſands of the Realm never agreed, and conſequently were truly Catholics. Heretics alſo were puniſhed, eſpecially thoſe three Sects that principally ranged at that time, to wit, <hi>Lutherans, Anabaptiſts,</hi> and <hi>Zwinglians,</hi> (all three taking their Origin from <hi>Luther</hi>) ſo as of all theſe three Sects King <hi>Henry</hi> burned ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; and albeit of the fourth ſort of men that oppoſed themſelves againſt him, to wit Catholics, he put divers alſo to death under the name of <hi>Papiſts,</hi> yet both this very Name, as alſo the different manner of their Deaths, but above all the nature of their Cauſe, doth evidently diſtinguiſh them from the other, and ſhew that <hi>their</hi> Deaths were true Martyrdoms, and the <hi>others</hi> due Puniſhment for their Wickedneſs.</p>
               <p n="17">
                  <note place="margin">The name of <hi>Papiſt</hi> not juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly puniſhable.</note>17. For firſt, the name of <hi>Papiſts,</hi> that ſignifieth them to hold with the Pope as Supreme Head of their Church, importeth no more hurt or offence than if any Sedition moved within any Realm, thoſe that hold with the King ſhould be called <hi>Kinglings;</hi> or thoſe, for example, that hold part with the Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> when any Apprentices would raiſe Rebellion againſt him, ſhould ſcornfully be called <hi>Mayoriſts;</hi> and generally for a man to hold with his Lawful Superiour cannot be termed a Faction, and much leſs an Hereſie.</p>
               <p n="18">
                  <note place="margin">The different puniſhments upon <hi>Catholics</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants</hi> doth ſhew what K. <hi>Henry</hi> thought of them both.</note>18. Secondly, the very difference and manner of puniſhment uſed by King <hi>Henry</hi> towards both parts; the one by Fire, the others by Beheading and Hanging, doth evidently ſhew what difference he made of them; the one as of Heretics, and the other as of men offending againſt his State and Perſon after he had made the Supremacy Eccleſiaſtical to be a matter of his State and of his Royal Dignity; whereby alſo he ſhewed that he was no Goſpeller.</p>
               <p n="19">19. But now for the third point, which is the moſt important of all the reſt, to ſhew the difference in theſe mens Cauſes, and that the Catholics ſuffered innocently for their Conſcience, and conſequently were true Martyrs; and that the other ſorts of Sectaries were puniſhed deſervedly as Malefactors, it is not hard to prove to him that is of any mean conſideration or indifferency in matters. For firſt, who will not grant but that he that is an honeſt and good man when he goeth to bed (for example) cannot eaſily be made an evil man in his ſleep, without any motive of his affection or free will at all? And again, He that is a good and true Subject towards his Prince and Countrey this day, how can he well to morrow be judged a Traytor, (the higheſt ſin of all other) if in the mean ſpace he change not his mind, nor do any act of word or deed contrary to that he did before: And yet this was the Cauſe of the Catholics put to death under King <hi>Henry</hi> for the Supremacy.</p>
               <p n="20">20. As for Example, Sir <hi>Thomas More</hi> was Priſoner in the Tower of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> upon ſome diſpleaſure, in the year 1534; where he attending only to his Prayers (as <note n="*" place="margin">In his Epiſtles.</note> himſelf teſtifieth) and to the Writing of ſome Spiritual Books pertaining to the contempt of this preſent tranſitory World, there paſſed in the mean time a Statute in the Parliament-houſe, appointing that whomſoever did not believe the King's Majeſty to be Supreme Head of the Church of <hi>England</hi>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:104638:53"/>
in cauſes Eccleſiaſtical, ſhould be a Traitor, and ſuffer death for it; which ſeeming a new and ſtrange thing unto him, and contrary to the belief of all his Forefathers, he could not ſo ſoon conform himſelf thereunto, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently refuſed (when he was demanded) to ſubſcribe to the Statute, and to make ſo great a change in his Faith upon the change of others; for which ſoon after he was put to death, not for that he had attempted, altered,<note place="margin">The true cauſe of Catholics ſuffering un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der K. <hi>Henry.</hi>
                  </note> or innovated any thing, as you ſee, but for that he would not alter and make innovation. And this was the proper true cauſe of all Catholics that ſuffered for the Supremacy under King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII.</p>
               <p n="20">20. But on the contrary ſide, the others that were put to death by him as Sectaries, did wickedly and preſumptuouſly alter and innovate of their own heads many things about Belief and Doctrin different from that which they had received, and contrary to the Belief of all their Forefathers, ancient Chriſtians for many Ages together; and that with ſuch obſtinacy, as no Reaſon, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, Diſcipline or Order, no Witneſs Human or Divine, could prevail with them; and albeit for this obſtinacy each Sect pretended Scriptures for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, yet the vertue and ſubſtance of Scriptures conſiſting in their true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and interpretation thereof, it was intolerable pride and inſolency in them to arrogate to themſelves the ſaid true Interpretation and Expoſition before the whole Church of God that went before them: And hereof enſued the juſtneſs of their puniſhment, which in Catholics can have no place, as before hath been ſhewed. Yet one Example of each ſort of theſe men ſhall we here alledge, thereby better to declare the Caſe.</p>
               <p n="21">21. King <hi>Henry</hi> during his Reign cauſed ſundry ſorts of men to be put to death about matter of Religion, as is notorious; and firſt,<note place="margin">The condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts</hi> and <hi>Arians</hi> by K. <hi>Henry.</hi>
                  </note> certain <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> and new <hi>Arians,</hi> namely in the 27th and 30th years of his Reign. In the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of theſe two Condemnations were nineteen Men and ſix Women, as <hi>Stow</hi> and others do relate; and in the ſecond were three Men and one Woman con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. Theſe <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> denied, amongſt other points, that Children ought to be baptized before they come to years of diſcretion, and can actually believe; for defence of which Doctrin they ſtood reſolutely upon many clear places of Scripture as to them then ſeemed; to wit, <hi>Qui crediderit &amp; baptizatus fuerit, ſalvus erit, Marc.</hi> 16. He that ſhall believe and be baptized, ſhall be ſaved.<note place="margin">Abſurd poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts</hi> &amp; <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> in K. <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>'s time grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Scriptures pretended.</note> 
                  <hi>Lo</hi> (ſay they) <hi>it is neceſſary to believe as well as to be baptized; which Infants being not able to do, ought not to receive Baptiſm in their Infancy; or if they do, they muſt be rebaptized again when they come to years of diſcretion.</hi> Thus reaſoned they. And beſides this Text, they and their chief Maſters do alledge almoſt thirty pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture more, which ſeem moſt plain and evident to them, as by their Books that are extant appeareth.</p>
               <p n="22">22. The like places they do alledge alſo for that other abſurd Poſition of theirs, <hi>That no Magiſtrate may puniſh by death:</hi> as for example, thoſe words of God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. <hi>Non occides,</hi> Thou ſhalt not kill; and again the ſaying of our Savior, <hi>Omnes qui acceperint gladium, gladio peribunt, Matth.</hi> 26. All that uſe the ſword ſhall periſh by the ſword. Thus ſaid the Anabaptiſts, from which by no means could they be drawn, but went willingly to the fire for teſtimony of their Opinions. The <hi>Arians</hi> alſo denying the Equality of God the Son with the Father, alledged no leſs plain places, as they would have them to ſeem; namely that of Chriſt himſelf in St. <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel, ch. 14. <hi>Pater meus major me eſt,</hi> My Father is greater than I; and many other, which were too long here to recite. And this of them, who burned together obſtinately in one fire in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="23">23. But what ſhall we ſay of the <hi>Lutherans?</hi> Do not they alledge plain places alſo, both againſt Us and <hi>Calviniſts</hi> as themſelves think? For againſt <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> in defence of the Real Preſence in the Sacrament, they urge the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:104638:54"/>
plain words of Chriſt as we do: <hi>Hoc eſt corpus meum:</hi> This is my Body. And againſt us, for their groſs Opinion that the ſubſtance of Bread and Wine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth together with the Body of Chriſt, they alledge many places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture where it is called Bread, which places the <hi>Zuinglians</hi> accepting, do turn the ſame againſt the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> affirming that for ſo much as it is ſo oftentimes called Bread in the Scripture,<note place="margin">The condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans</hi> and <hi>Zuinglians</hi> by King <hi>Henry.</hi>
                  </note> it is not the true Body of Chriſt at all: And this paſſed between Fryer <hi>Barns</hi> and the two Apoſtata Prieſts <hi>Gerard</hi> and <hi>Jerom,</hi> burned with him: The firſt a fervent <hi>Lutheran,</hi> the other two earneſt <hi>Zuinglians,</hi> all three conſumed by Fire at one Stake in <hi>Smithfield</hi> by King <hi>Henries</hi> appointment, in the Thirty-ſecond year of his Reign.</p>
               <p n="24">24. But now was there a third or fourth ſort of Sectaries in K. <hi>Henries</hi> days, who were neither <hi>Anabaptiſts, Arians,</hi> nor yet perfect <hi>Lutherans</hi> or <hi>Zwing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians,</hi> but would have the Controverſie of the Bleſſed Sacrament and Real Preſence, to be an indifferent thing to be believed, or not believed. as every Man ſhould think beſt:<note place="margin">The opinion of <hi>Tyndall</hi> and <hi>Frith</hi> agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Luther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans nor Zwin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glians.</note> So held <hi>William Tyndall,</hi> as alſo his Scholar <hi>John Frith,</hi> whom <hi>John Fox</hi> doth compare to St. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Timothy, Frith</hi> being Burned in <hi>Smithfield</hi> by the Kings expreſs Commandment in the Twenty-ſixth year of his Reign, and <hi>Tyndall</hi> not long after in <hi>Flanders</hi> by the ſaid Kings procurement, as more largely we ſhall declare in the Third Part of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, when we come to examine <hi>John Fox</hi> his Calendar of Martyrs. Now it ſhall be ſufficient for proof of that we ſay to alledge <hi>Fox</hi> himſelf, who ſetting down the Articles of <hi>Frith</hi> for which he was Burned, aſſigneth this for the firſt.<note place="margin">Fox pag. <hi>942.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Firſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the matter of the Sacrament is no neceſſary Article of Faith under pain of Damnation,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But may be believed or not believed as every Man ſhall think beſt.</hi> And for proof thereof alledgeth divers Arguments out of Scripture, that the Fathers forſooth of the Old Teſtament, were ſaved by the ſame Faith that we are, and yet were not bound to believe the Real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Fox</hi> ſeemeth to like well both of this Argument and of the Hereſie.</p>
               <p n="25">25. Now then here be four or five ſorts of Sectaries Condemned by King <hi>Henry,</hi> and all defended themſelves by ſhew of Scriptures, but for that each of them doth reſerve the interpretation of Scripture to themſelves, and thereby teacheth new Doctrin, contrary to that which was received generally in the known Church before them, to whoſe judgment and interpretation they will not yield themſelves: Hereof it followed, that the indictment of Hereſie ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth truly and juſtly againſt them, and that they were worthily Condemned and Burned for this Pride, ſelf-will and obſtinacy. But on the contrary ſide againſt the Catholics, that died for the Eccleſiaſtical Supremacy of the Pope, none of theſe Accuſations can juſtly be laid, for that they do neither ſtand upon their own judgment, nor have invented any thing of new, nor do adhere to their own Interpretations, or Expoſition of Scriptures, but being accuſed, do make their Plea and Defence far otherwiſe, to wit, that they found this Doctrin of the Popes Supremacy in uſe and practice before they were born,<note place="margin">The different plea or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholics from heretics,</note> as a thing received from Age to Age by the known Catholic Church time out of mind: that they ſee all Chriſtian Kingdoms and Princes to have embraced the ſame, and General Councils to have allowed thereof: That the Texts and Examples of Scripture alledged for the proof of this Article, and all others whereon they ſtand, are not inventions of their own, but ſo expounded by Ancient Fathers and uniform conſent of the Catholic Church; that all our Chriſtian Engliſh Kings from our firſt Converſion unto King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth acknowledged this Spiritual Authority of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> and King <hi>Henry</hi> himſelf defended the ſame moſt earneſtly with his own Pen, not many years before, againſt <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Lutherans:</hi> That it is not a thing deviſed but delivered, as <note n="*" place="margin">Tertull. l. de praeſcript. ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſus haereſ.</note>

               <p n="26">26. This was the Defence and Pleading of Catholics under King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth to excuſe themſelves from Treaſon, objected againſt them, for hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Popes Supremacy; wherein you ſee divers notorious differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Defence of the Sectaries, and them, for that amongſt the Sectaries, every one held what himſelf thought beſt, of things invented by themſelves, every one cited Scriptures, and interpreted them as he liſted, without Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, Preſident or Example of former Ages, and conſequently they are juſtly called Heretics, that is to ſay chooſers. For that they choſe to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves what to believe in every Sect, and reduced the laſt and final reſolution of all things to their own Wills and Wits, which in matters of belief is the higheſt Crime that againſt God and his Church can be committed.</p>

But on the other ſide the ſtate and condition of the Catholics, and their cauſe is quite oppoſite to this, for that they ſtick to Authority, Obedience, Integrity, Example of their Anceſtors; they bring nothing of their own; they invent or innovate nothing: They ſtand only upon that which they have found Eſtabliſhed to them, not by this or that Man, or by this or that Author of any Sect, or by this or that particular Congregation, fellowſhip, or Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or by this or that Town, City, Province, Kingdom, or Country, but generally by the whole univerſal Church and Paſtors thereof, and therefore properly and truly are called Catholics, which is to ſay <hi>

               <p n="29">29. And with this alſo will we end the Diſcourſe of King <hi>Henries</hi> Life, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſufficiently ſhewed (as to me it ſeemeth) that the Catholic Religion held her footing and continuance alſo under ther Reign of this King, no leſs perhaps than before, yea ſhe ſhewed her ſelf much more to the World, by the Perſecution which then ſhe ſuffered, than before in the time of peace; for that the Famous and Illuſtrious Martyrdoms of ſuch excellent Men as were Biſhop <hi>Fiſher,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas More,</hi> Dr. <hi>Foreſt</hi> and many other ſuch Worthies, that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered Martyrdom in thoſe days, did more Illuſtrate her, and made extern Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to talk more of the Zeal and Conſtancy of Engliſh Catholics, than ever they would have done if that Perſecution had not fallen out; and the like ſucceſs hath happened ſince both under King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth and her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty that now is, as briefly we ſhall here declare.</p>
               <p n="30">30. And as for King <hi>Edwards</hi> Reign, as it was but ſhort,<note place="margin">King <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>6th.</hi> his Reign.</note> and the firſt paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage from Catholic Religion to open Profeſſion of Hereſie: So was it not ſo ſharp for effuſion of Blood as under King <hi>Henry:</hi> For that the King being very young, and thoſe that Governed in his Name not thorowly ſettled in their States and Affairs, troubled alſo with much Diviſion and Emulation among themſelves, could not attend to proſecute matters ſo exactly againſt Catholics, as ſome of their deſires and Appetites were; yet began they very well, as we may ſee by the moſt unjuſt Perſecutions and Deprivations of two principal Biſhops, <hi>Gardiner</hi> of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> and <hi>Bonner</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> by
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:104638:55"/>
ſuch violent Calumnious manner as was proper for Heretics to uſe. The par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars whereof <hi>John Fox</hi> doth ſet down at large, whereby a Man may take a taſte what they meant to have done,<note place="margin">The attempts of <hi>Cranmer</hi> and <hi>Ridley</hi> and others of their crew in King <hi>Edwards</hi> days.</note> if they had had time.

               <p n="31">31. And hereupon divers were laid hands on and Impriſoned, divers fled over Seas, ſundry moſt Captious and Calumnious Queſtions and Demands were deviſed to entangle Men: As Namely: <hi>Whether a King of one year old, were not as truly a King as at Forty or Fifty,</hi> which if you did grant concerning the Title and Right of his Crown (which is true) then preſently they inferred, that King <hi>Edward,</hi> being but Nine years old, wanting yet diſcretion might alſo be lawful Head of the Church, and determine Controverſies of Religion, yea change the Faith and Religion which his Father and all his Anceſtors Kings and Princes of <hi>England,</hi> all Parliaments, Synods, and Councils before his days had left unto him for the ſpace of a Thouſand years and more. And albeit he had not ſufficient judgment to underſtand what Religion meant, yet was he made judge thereof by vertue of his Birth and Succeſſion to the Crown.<note place="margin">The attempts of <hi>Seymor</hi> the Protector, and <hi>John Bale</hi> in flattery to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him.</note> And this Point was wonderfully urged by the Protector <hi>Seymor,</hi> to all Preachers, Prelats, and Biſhops of that time, that they ſhould inculcate the ſame to the people in their Sermons, to the end that himſelf taking all the ſaid Child Kings Authority upon him, might be Head and Judge in his place: Whereunto that he might ſeem the more fit and able for his excellent learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>John Bale</hi> the Apoſtata Friar that lived under him, was not aſhamed to Publiſh in Print, and place him for a Learned Author amongſt his Illuſtrious Britiſh Writters,<note place="margin">Bal. deſcript.

                  </note> for that ſome Proclamations perhaps paſſed by his hands, tho' otherwiſe he was known to be ſo unlearned, as he could ſcarce Write or Read.</p>
               <p n="32">32. But yet (as I ſaid) this Doctrin or rather Paradox, of the Child Kings ſupereminent ability, high Authority and Supreme Eccleſiaſtical Power to determin, alter, change and diſpoſe of matters of Religion at his pleaſure, tho' he were but of one year old, was ſounded in Pulpits every where at this time; whereof Sir <hi>John Cheke</hi> the Kings School-maſter amongſt others Wrote a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Treatiſe, beſides the large Meſſage ſent in the Kings Name (but of his Writing) to the Catholic people of <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> as after ſhall be ſhewed. The ſame alſo was objected grievouſly againſt Biſhop <hi>Gardiner</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Bonner</hi> by Name, that they had not in their Sermons appointed unto them by the Protector, ſo ſufficiently urged this Point of the Kings Eccleſiaſtical Power in his Nonage, as was required. And this eſpecially for that the people in divers parts of the Realm, and namely thoſe of <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> ſeeing ſuch alterations to be made in Religion under the Minority of a Child, quite contrary to the Laws and Statutes left by King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth,<note place="margin">See <hi>Stow</hi> and other Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clers in the year 1549.</note> and that all things went backward both at home and abroad (the Towns we had in <hi>France</hi> being loſt, or upon the point of loſing) they complained firſt, and after took Arms for defence of their Ancient Religion, in the beginning of the third year of this Kings Reign, the people of <hi>Sommerſetſhire</hi> and <hi>Lincolnſhire</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning firſt in the Month of <hi>May;</hi> and then in <hi>July</hi> the people of <hi>Eſſex, Kent, Suffolk, Norfolk, Cornwall,</hi> and <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> and in <hi>Auguſt</hi> thoſe alſo of <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> all crying and demanding to have the Catholic Religion remain as it was left by King <hi>Henry,</hi> at leaſt-wiſe until King <hi>Edward</hi> came to law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

age, thereby to be able to determin and judge of matters of Religion; which demand did wonderfully trouble and vex the Lord <hi>Seymour</hi> Protector, and other new Goſpellers, who being hungry after Catholics Goods, could abide no delay in making this deſired Innovation.</p>
               <p n="33">33. And albeit, before theſe Inſurrections fell out,<note place="margin">The general averſion of <hi>Engliſh</hi>-people againſt the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie.</note> they did well ſee by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers attempts that the heart of the people was wholly againſt thoſe their Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations in Religion, as appeareth plainly by a Speech of the Lord <hi>Rich,</hi> then Chancellor, to the Sheriffs and Juſtices of Peace of all Shires, gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>London</hi> in the year 1548, being the ſecond of King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Reign, as at large you may ſee in <hi>Fox:</hi> yet ſuch was their importunity in this behalf,<note place="margin">Fox p. <hi>1185.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="34">34. The ſame <hi>Fox</hi> alſo ſetteth down in another place what the young King anſwered to the <hi>Devonſhire</hi>-men that deſir'd that the ſtate of matters in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion might remain as King <hi>Henry</hi> had ordained and left them; and in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular they required that the Statute of <hi>Six Articles</hi> againſt Heretics might ſtand in force until King <hi>Edward</hi> came to full age. Whereunto let us hear his Anſwer, and conſider thereby how matters went in thoſe days. To the firſt, about the Statute of <hi>Six Articles</hi> made by his Father, and inviolably kept all days of his life, the little Child anſwered thus: <hi>Know you what you require?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Fox p. <hi>1189.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>They were Laws made, but quickly repented; too bloody were they to be born of Our people: You know they helped <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s to extend rigor, and to draw Our Sword very often; yea, they were as a Whetſtone unto Our Sword, and for your Cauſes We have left to uſe them; and ſith Our mercy moved <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s to write Our Laws with Milk, how be you blinded to ask them in Blood,</hi> &amp;c?</p>
               <p n="35">35. And then further he ſaith, <hi>But to leave this manner of reaſoning with you,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">K. <hi>Henry</hi>'s Laws rejected by his Son K. <hi>Edward.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>We let you wit, That the ſame Laws have been annulled by Our Parliament with great rejoyce of Our Subjects, and not now to be called by Our Subjects in queſtion. Dare any of you ſtand againſt an Act of Parliament,</hi> &amp;c? <hi>Aſſure you moſt ſurely, that We of no earthly thing make ſuch account, as to have Our Laws obey'd, for herein reſteth Our Honor; and ſhall any of you dare to breath againſt Our Honor,</hi> &amp;c? Lo how little account this little King Child was taught to make of his old Father's Laws; and how thundringly to ſpeak for the maintenance of his own! But when they came to the ſecond point about his Nonage, he is yet more reſolute; for thus he writeth:</p>
               <p n="36">36. <hi>In the end of your requeſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>you would have Our Fathers Laws ſtand in force until Our full age. But to this We think, if ye knew what ye ſpake,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">K. <hi>Edward</hi>'s reply to the demand of the people of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonſhire.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>you would never have uttered that motion, nor ever have given breath to ſuch a thought. For what think you of Our Kingdom? Be We of leſs Authority for Our Age? You muſt firſt know, that as a King We have no difference of years nor time; but as a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Man, and Creature of God, We have Youth, and by his ſufferance ſhall have Age. We are your rightful King, your leige Lord, your King anointed, your King crowned, the ſovereign King of</hi> England, <hi>not by Our Age, but by God's Ordinance; We poſſeſs Our Crown not by Years, but by the Blood and Deſcent from Our Father King</hi> Henry <hi>VIII.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="37">37. All this, and much more, did they make the innocent young King to talk and write in defence of their Innovations, who had more Intereſt therein than He. And as for the Catholic People, albeit they deny'd not but that he was a true King in his minority of Age, yet no man was ſo fooliſh as to think (notwithſtanding all theſe preachings to the contrary) but that it was a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent thing for matters of Religion to be altered now in his Name, than after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward by Himſelf when he ſhould come to Age.</p>

                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:104638:56"/>38. But among all others, none urged this Argument ſo much, nor with ſuch Authority, as the King's eldeſt Siſter the Princeſs Lady <hi>Mary,</hi> Heir-apparent to the Crown; who being a zealous Catholic, and yet wiſhing well alſo to the Protector,<note place="margin">Q. <hi>Mary</hi>'s ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition unto the Protector and Council.</note> did by ſundry Letters, to be ſeen in <hi>Fox,</hi> admoniſh both Him and the reſt of the Council, <hi>That they ſhould look well what they did, during the King's minority, in altering the Will, Laws and Ordinances of his and her Father King</hi> Henry, <hi>for that afterward they were like enough to be called to account about the ſame when the King her Brother ſhould come to full years.</hi> Moreover ſhe admoniſhed them. <hi>That they had no Authority to make ſuch alteration in ſo great matters as they did, but ought rather to conſerve things in the ſtate left unto them by King</hi> Henry <hi>her Father, according as by ſolemn Oath they had ſworn unto him before his death that they would do (but eſpecially about matters of Religion) until the King her Brother came unto lawful Age.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Hereſie in K. <hi>Edward</hi>'s days entred by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</note>39. By all which is clearly ſeen how the Catholic Religion remained in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> moſt ſubſtantially rooted in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s days, and that Hereſie entred only from the teeth outward, and was maintained by violence of Temporal Authority, and according to that was the ſucceſs: For after many toils and turmoils, one killing another of thoſe that governed, when they thought they had laid a ſure Platform to continue the ſame, by excluding the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> and Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and thruſting in <hi>Jane</hi> the Duke of <hi>Suffolk</hi>'s Daughter, after King <hi>Edward</hi>'s death, and had ſo plotted and fortified that Deſign, as they thought it ſure; the only Zeal of the common Catholic People, for the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the uſe of Catholic Religion again, overthrew all, and placed Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> as is notorious to the World. And afterward, if we conſider the end of moſt of them, which in thoſe days being Counſellors, for Ambition, or other reſpects, were promoters of Hereſie, as <hi>Dudley, Pembroke, Wincheſter, Arundel, Shrewsbury, Paget,</hi> and others, they all died Catholicly, and moſt of them in this Queens days, when with much favour of the State they might have ſhewed themſelves Heretics.</p>

And thus much for the Reign of King <hi>Edward;</hi> after whom Queen <hi>Mary</hi> ſucceeding, reſtored Catholic Religon to her ſeat and ancient poſſeſſion again; which having endured only five years, it pleaſed God to give another trial and probation to his Servants, by a new alteration, in the beginning of her Majeſty's Reign that now is: but yet not ſo forſaking them, nor their Cauſe, but he left ſufficient teſtimony in our Realm at that time what Religion had born rule unto that day, and how and when the change began.

Now this ſhall be ſufficient to ſhew both the great number and reſpective quality of domeſtical Witneſſes for the Catholic Faith, and continuance thereof in our Countrey during the time of this ſharp Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion under her Majeſty, and that never more than in this time hath the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic Church been perſpicuous, honorable and eminent in our Realm; which is altogether contrary to that which <hi>John Fox</hi> aſcribeth to his Church, whoſe Inviſibility, Obſcurity, and lurking from the eyes of men, he both granteth and excuſeth, by the preſence of Perſecution againſt her; whereas we hold on the other ſide, that the true Church (and conſequently Ours) is ever more viſible and notoriouſly known in time of Affliction and Perſecution, than in Peace.</p>
               <p n="45">45. And ſo we have ſhewed by Example of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church, eſpecially in this preſent Age, wherein not only domeſtical ſufferings at home have come by Fame, Books, and Writings to the knowledge of Foreign Nations, and thereby alſo the notice of ſo many worthy conſtant Catholics that are within the Realm; but whole Troops alſo both of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men and Women in Exile for their Conſciences, do repreſent the ſame daily to their eyes, as it were by a lively ſpectacle, to the wonder of the Chriſtian World.

And truly, when I conſider the matter more ſeriouſly with my ſelf,<note place="margin">The Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the firſt Part of this Treatiſe.</note> I doubt much whether <hi>England,</hi> if it had continued Catholic, had ever enjoy'd ſuch excellent Education for their Youth at home, as by occaſion of this Tribulation God hath given them abroad in Foreign Nations. Certainly the Example is rare, and never heard of in former times, and at this day the like is ſeen in few other Nations beſides Us; but in none of thoſe that have ſuffered for Catholic Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is this Bleſſing found ſo abundantly as in Ours, God make us grateful for it; for if our Ingratitude turn not the courſe of his Mercies hitherto uſed towards us, it ſeemeth evident that he will not ſuffer the Seed of Catholic Religion to be extinguiſhed in <hi>England,</hi> having conſerved the ſame ſo potently and ſtrangely unto this day, which is from the firſt preaching of the Apoſtles and Apoſtolic-men to the <hi>Britans,</hi> unto the time of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> I. under whom our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation was converted, as hath been declared, and from thence again downward unto Us, which is more than a thouſand years; and ſo I doubt not but he will to the Worlds end, if our ſins deſerve not the contrary.

               <p>HAving declared in the former Part of this Treatiſe how the Faith of Chriſt was firſt preached to the <hi>Britans</hi> at two ſeveral times, and then to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, and all by <hi>Roman</hi> Preachers; and that the ſame Faith hath continued from Age to Age in a viſible conſpicuous Church until our days: there remaineth now, that we examin in this ſecond Part, Where the Proteſtants Church was in all this time, and whether they had any at all? And if they had, of what ſort of men it conſiſted, and whether it were the ſame with the Church before-deſcribed, or partly <hi>the ſame,</hi> partly <hi>different;</hi> or whether they could ſtand together, being oppoſite in any one point of Faith? Moreover, whether the one did perſecute the other, or might be reconciled or agreed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether? And finally, what is the ſtate of the one and the other at this day? For examination of which points, we ſhall have occaſion to run over again with more advice all the former ſixteen Ages from Chriſt downward, and therein to ſee and conſider, What Church either flouriſhed or prevailed throughout every Age, either Ours, or that of <hi>John Fox;</hi> and which of them is likelieſt to have come down from the Apoſtles? As alſo, Whether that Church which was viſibly founded by the Apoſtles, and put on foot by them and theirs, could periſh, or vaniſh away to give place to another? And theſe are the principal Points of this ſecond Part diſcuſſed in the Chapters following; tho' firſt, before we enter into this examination, we have thought good to treat certain general Points, that make way thereunto, as by the next Chapter you ſhall perceive.</p>

But yet firſt I mean to note by the way certain principal points to be conſidered for better underſtanding of all that is to be handled in this Chapter, or about this whole matter of Eccleſiaſtical Succeſſion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whereof the firſt may be that which I have touched in the end of the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Chapter, to wit, of how great importance this point is,<note place="margin">The principal point to be noted of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion.</note> (I mean the Succeſſion and Continuation of Teachers, the one conform to the other in matter of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief and Religion) for clear demonſtration of Truth in matters of Controverſie, and for ſtaying any diſcreet man's judgment from wavering hither and thither in his belief, according to that which holy St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſaid of himſelf, and felt in himſelf: For that conſidering the great diverſity of Sects that ſwarm'd in his time, and every one pretending Truth, Antiquity, Purity, and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Scriptures, and himſelf alſo having been miſled by one of theſe Sects for many years, was brought by God at length to be a true Catholic, and to feel in himſelf the force of this viſible Succeſſion of the Catholic Church.

               <p n="7">7.

               <p n="8">8. Thus ſaid St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> of the viſible Church in his days, which had not continued much more than 400 years. But what would he ſay if he liv'd in our days,<note place="margin">Barking of Heretics a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin</hi> termeth it.</note> after almoſt 1200 years Succeſſion more ſince he wrote this, when he ſhould hear far greater and more ſpiteful barking of Heretics againſt the ſame, than he heard in his days? tho' then alſo he heard much, and much of that which we hear now. But if St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſhould live now again, there is no doubt of one thing; which is, that he would make this his Argument of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:104638:59"/>
Succeſſion far more ſtrong againſt our Heretics, and eſteem it ſo much the more, by how much the Power of Chriſt hath ſhewed it ſelf more Omnipotent in continuing the ſame ſince, for ſo many Ages more after him, amidſt ſo many troubles and turmoils, changes and alterations of Empires, and Kingdoms, and Temporal States, as before we have noted. And if in <hi>England</hi> we can number above ſeventy Archbiſhops of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> all of one Religion, the one ſucceeding the other, ſince our firſt Converſion by St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> our Apoſtle, (not to ſpeak any thing of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Church before us) as you may ſee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed by <hi>Cambden</hi> and other new heretical Writers of our own; and that this <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church was the ſame in Faith and Belief with the <hi>Britiſh,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In deſcr. Cantii.</note> (as before hath been ſhewed) and both of them one with the <hi>Roman</hi> and General Church from the very beginning to this time, what an Antiquity is this? and how clear and evident a Succeſſion? And how would St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> urge this Argument againſt our Proteſtants, if he were now alive again.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Sure I am, that if any one Baron, Earl, or Duke in <hi>England</hi> could ſhew but the half of theſe years for the continuance and poſſeſſion of any Temporal State, Lordſhip, or Land in <hi>England,</hi> he would highly eſteem thereof, and thereby make a glorious defence againſt any wrangling Companion that ſhould preſume to pretend the ſame, and deprive him thereof, if he could truly ſay and prove (as we do in the Cauſe of our Church) that his Anceſtors for 1300 years together had continued in that poſſeſſion. But no man can preſcribe any ſuch time in temporal matters, and therefore are they well called Temporal, for that they change in a little time. And he that will read the foreſaid <hi>Camb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>'s Story, towards the end of every <hi>Engliſh</hi> Shire,<note place="margin">A compariſon between the durance of the Church &amp; temporal States.</note> (where he taketh upon him to recount the Earls or Dukes that have had their States and Titles over that Shire) he ſhall ſee ſuch a broken Succeſſion in thoſe States and Signories as it is pitiful to behold, no Dukedom or Earldom continuing lightly three or four Generations together in any one Name or Family. And this is the frailty and uncertainty of human things.</p>
               <p n="10">10. But for matters of Religion appertaining to the Soul, Almighty God hath given another manner of force unto Succeſſion both of Men and Faith. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, in the Law of Nature, he made the ſame to endure by only Tradition, without Writing, for more than 2500 years, under the ancient Patriarchs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and after the Flood of <hi>Noe.</hi> And afterward again in the written Law, the <hi>Jews</hi> continued the poſſeſſion of their Religion by Succeſſion of Biſhops and Eccleſiaſtical Governors from <hi>Moſes</hi> unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi> above 1500 years, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all varieties of times and calamities. And no leſs from Chriſt to our Age hath he continued the ſame in a much more glorious ſort and manner. In which latter time of Chriſtian Religion (to ſpeak only of this for the preſent) ſo many mutations have been made, both in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire it ſelf, and all other Realms and Kingdoms round about us, as all men know, and may be ſeen in Hiſtories: And yet hath the Succeſſion of the Catholic Church and Paſtors thereof, together with the Union of Faith therein taught, been moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly conſerved amongſt all theſe toſſings and turmoils, breaches and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Temporal Kingdoms; which could never have been, but by the Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Hand of our Savior that hath defended it; eſpecially conſidering withal the great multitude of Sects and Hereſies that from time to time have riſen, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to impugn the ſame, but could never prevail. And this is ſufficient for this firſt and principal point of the vertue and force of Eccleſiaſtical Succeſſion.</p>
               <p n="11">11.

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:104638:61"/>
and above all was he troubled (as it ſeemeth) with the reaſon and neceſſity of the matter it ſelf; for if the Church of Chriſt be inviſible, how can <hi>Fox</hi> or the <hi>Magdeburgians</hi> write ſo great and large ſtories thereof?<note place="margin">

                  </note> To which effect <hi>Illyricus</hi> writing upon the Genealogy ſet down by St. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s Goſpel, of the true Church from the beginning, ſaith thus: <hi>Oſtendit iſta ſeries Eccleſiam &amp; Religionem veram habere certas hiſtorias ſuae originis &amp; progreſſus;</hi>

               <p n="21">21.

You ſhall hear his words.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="23">23. Thus ſaith he; wherein you ſee that he maketh the true Church viſible, but only to ſuch as are in her, and Members thereof. A device (I think) ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard of before, and fit for the Brains of <hi>John Fox,</hi> which were known to be out of tune for many years before he died; for if he do not trifle and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate, (meaning one-where <hi>internal Viſibility</hi> by Faith, and another-where <hi>external Viſibility</hi> to the Eye) but doth mean indeed as he ſhould do, and as the Controverſie is meant, of external viſibility to man's eye, then is it moſt ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous that none can ſee the true Church in this World, but he that is a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of her; for ſhe is to be ſeen as well to her Enemies and Adverſaries, as to her Friends and Children; the One to impugn and fight againſt her, the Other to acknowledge and obey her. And I would (for examples ſake) demand of <hi>John Fox,</hi> Whether <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Nero,</hi> that perſecuted the true viſible Church of Chriſt, were of that Church or no? For if they were not, then by his ſentence they could not ſee her, and conſequently not perſecute her.</p>
               <p n="24">24. His compariſon alſo between Truth and the true Church doth not hold; for that Truth is a ſpiritual thing, to be ſeen only by the eye of our Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but the true Church, conſiſting of viſible Men and Women, may be ſeen by man's eye; tho' the truth thereof (to wit, whether this or that viſible Congregation be the true Church of Chriſt) is a matter of Underſtanding and Belief, confirmed unto us by ſuch Arguments as before we have recited, and others. So as albeit the aforeſaid Perſecutors <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Nero</hi> (for Example) did not ſee the Truth of that Church which they perſecuted,<note place="margin">How Enemies and Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors do ſee the true Church.</note> in reſpect of their Doctrin, (for then perhaps they would not have done it) yet did they both ſee and know that this was Chriſt's viſible Church, to wit, a Congregation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing his Name and Doctrin; yea, they might know further that it was his true Church, ſeeing it was begun viſibly and evidently by him and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles in their days, and ſo continued on without interruption; and if they had further known and believed (as we do) that he had promiſed to maintain and defend this Church unto the worlds end, then muſt they either have doubted of his Fidelity or Power to perform it, or muſt have believed alſo that this

Church could not fail; whereof Proteſtants doubting, muſt needs doubt alſo of the one or the other, to wit, of the Fidelity and of the Ability of our Savior to perform his promiſe. And this is the force of Succeſſion even with Enemies and Infidels</p>

And forſomuch as the true Church of God goeth not lightly alone, but is accompanied with ſome other Church or Chappel of the Devil to deface and malign the ſame; neceſſary it is, that the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them both be ſeen, and the deſcent of the right Church to be deſcribed from the Apoſtles time,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="26">26. Here we ſee all <hi>John Fox</hi> his drift laid down. Firſt, he meaneth to contradict all former Writers that have magnified the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Greatneſs and Glory thereof, which he calleth <hi>the Devil's Chappel:</hi> And in this he muſt contradict all the ancient Fathers and Writers for divers hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years after Chriſt, as <hi>Irenaeus, Tertullian, Auguſtin, Optatus,</hi> and other Writers, that bring down the deſcent of the true Church of Chriſt, by the Succeſſion of the Biſhops and Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as before you have heard. And ſecondly <hi>Fox</hi> meaneth to ſet out another Chriſtian Church, <hi>trodden under foot before, neglected in the World, not regarded in Hiſtories, and almoſt ſcarce viſible or known; and yet was, and is</hi> (forſooth) <hi>the only true Church of Chriſt, keeping ſome ſpark of his true Doctrin and Religion,</hi> (he doth not ſay that all was true which ſhe held, nor that all Chriſt's Doctrin was taught in her, but only ſome ſparks or ſcraps of true Doctrin) And further he promiſeth, that he will deſcribe <hi>the deſcent of this Church from the Apoſtles time.</hi>

               <p>HE that will conſider the proportion of <hi>John Fox</hi> his Book of <hi>Acts and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents</hi> in the latter Edition, he ſhall find it the greateſt perhaps in Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume that ever was put forth in our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue; and the falſeſt in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,<note place="margin">The ſubſtance of <hi>John Fox</hi>'s Book.</note> without <hi>perhaps,</hi> that ever was publiſhed in any Tongue. The Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume conſiſteth of above a thouſand Leaves of the largeſt Paper that lightly hath been ſeen, and every Leaf containeth four great Columns; and yet, if you conſider how many Leaves of thoſe thouſand he hath ſpent in Deduction of the whole Church, either His or Ours, and the whole Eccleſiaſtical Story thereof, for the firſt thouſand years after Chriſt, they are by his own account but threeſcore and four, to wit, ſcarce the thirtieth part of that he beſtoweth in the laſt five hundred years.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And further, if this his thouſand years Story, containing threeſcore and four leaves, be ſifted and examined what it containeth, not four of them do appertain to that which he ſhould handle (which is, <hi>the viſible Deduction of his Church</hi>) as we ſhall endeavor briefly to ſhew,<note place="margin">The diviſion of 1060 years into four prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal parts.</note> dividing the whole thouſand and threeſcore years, from Chriſt to <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror, into four diſtinct <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> Times or Stations, appointed out by <hi>John Fox</hi> himſelf in his Book; to wit, the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> firſt from Chriſt to <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> containing 300 years; the ſecond from <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> to K. <hi>Ethelbert</hi>'s Converſion by St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> containing other 300 years; the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> third, from King <hi>Ethelbert,</hi> and other ſix Kings of <hi>England</hi> reigning jointly with him, unto King <hi>Egbert</hi> the firſt Monarch of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> ſpace is ſomewhat more than other 200 years; and the fourth from King <hi>Egbert</hi> to <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror, containing the ſame, or ſome few more years.</p>

And to examin this point (to wit, of what Religion they were, whether more of Ours,<note place="margin">Who do more honor the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Martyrs.</note> or of His) divers conſiderations may be brought in: As firſt, Who of us do more honor them? We keep their Days and Feaſts, as all men know; we put them in our Eccleſiaſtical Calendar and Martyrology; we keep their Relics; we honor their Tombs; we call upon them in Heaven to pray for us, as reigning in moſt high Glory with Chriſt: All which Proteſtants do miſlike; yea,<note place="margin">See <hi>Fox</hi>'s Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendar in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his Volume.</note> 
                  <hi>John Fox</hi> by name hath put the moſt of them (I mean of the Martyrs of theſe firſt 300 years) quite out of his Eccleſiaſtical Calendar, to give place to <hi>John Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liff, John Huſſe, Martin Luther,</hi> and other like Companions, as may be ſeen in the very firſt pages of his Book; which is a ſign that we eſteem and honor them more than they; which we would not do, if we did not perſuade our ſelves that they were of our Religion, and not of Proteſtants, in any point of Controverſie between us.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Moreover the Chriſtian viſible Church of that time, (to wit,<note place="margin">The ſecond Reaſon.</note> of thoſe firſt 300 years, wherein theſe Martyrs ſuffered and were put to death) would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have regiſtred them for Saints, nor admitted them into the number of true Martyrs, if in all points they had not been of her Faith and Communion; no more than ſhe did thoſe of divers Sects, namely of the <hi>Marcioniſts</hi> and <hi>Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts,</hi> who were very many, and bragged of Martyrdom, and of God's aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance therein, no leſs, but much more, than true Catholics; as <hi>Apollinaris,</hi>

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:104638:63"/>
they died for Chriſt) for that they agreed not with her in all points of Faith and Belief. And conſequently we may infer for moſt certain, that ſeeing the Catholic Church of that time (and of all times ſince) hath held theſe Martyrs before mentioned of the firſt ten Perſecutions for true Saints and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs indeed, and have continued their honorable remembrance, both by Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and celebrating their annual Feaſts and Memories; ſure it is, that they agreed fully with the ſaid known Catholic Church of thoſe Ages. Whereof we infer again, That ſeeing the Faith of thoſe firſt 300 years was continued (as <note n="*" place="margin">Supra c. <hi>5, 6.</hi>
                  </note> before we have proved) in the ſecond 300 years, and ſo conſequently downward, and delivered to us; and foraſmuch as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was held ſtill for Head of all this Church, it cannot be that theſe Martyrs were of <hi>John Fox</hi>'s Religion, and conſequently are to no purpoſe brought in by him, but only for that he had nothing elſe to talk of, or to make a ſhew of handling ſome pious matter in his Book.</p>

And the other falſhood alſo cannot be deny'd, whereby they affirm the Doctrin which we truly hold and practiſe in this behalf, about honoring of Saints, to have been at any time held for Error, or condemn'd by the ancient Catholic Church, or Teachers thereof, for ſuch. Truth it is, that the <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deburgians</hi> are not aſham'd to note this for an Error in <hi>Origen; Invocandos An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelos Origenes putavit, homil.</hi> 1. <hi>in Ezech.

Certain it is, they cannot; which is a ſingular Argument againſt them; for that thoſe Watchmen of the Church, that noted and condemned thoſe other Errors of his, would have noted alſo this, if it had been taken for an Error in thoſe days. And further,<note place="margin">About honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of Angels.</note> I ſay to the <hi>Magdeburgians,</hi> Let them tell us whether other holy Fathers (yea, the chiefeſt of God's Church) after <hi>Origen</hi> did not hold the very ſame Doctrin? Sure I am, that the <hi>Magdeburgians</hi> themſelves, in the very next Century after, do condemn by Name St. <hi>Ephrem</hi> and St. <hi>Hilary</hi> for this Doctrin of Invocation of Angels in the ſame ſenſe that <hi>Origen</hi> did hold it.

                  </note> in the ſame third Century, they do reprehend by Name for Invocation of other Saints (which is the ſame Controverſie) the graveſt Doctors of the Church, to wit, St. <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> St. <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> St. <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius,

Ephrem,</hi> and <hi>Prudentius,</hi> citing their plain words, and condemning their Doctrin in this behalf.

                  </note> as before we have declared. For which cauſe I am to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute the ſame from Age to Age in this Treatiſe, from this time downwards to our days, in the Chapters that do enſue: where we ſhall ſee who ſticketh to her, and who flieth from her; who followeth her conſtantly, or who giveth the ſlip; for that ſhe being now once ſo Potent, Notorious, and Illuſtrious, as both Parts do confeſs, (if he will ſtand to it in earneſt that ſhe is his Church alſo) it is not poſſible that ſhe ſhould be loſt, ſhrink, or fade away again; but that all the World muſt ſee it, How, Where, When, and by Whom ſo great an Accident ſhould fall out; neither can <hi>Fox</hi> and his People, being now once in Her and of Her, (by his own pretence) be found out of her afterward, but only by Apoſtacy, or Hereſie, and running away. This then let us examin in the Ages following.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The proſecution of the ſame matter; to wit, of the Deſcent of the Catholic and Proteſtant Church for other Three Hundred years; that is, from Pope <hi>Sylveſter</hi> and <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> to Pope <hi>Gregory,</hi> and <hi>Mauritius</hi> the Emperour: And where <hi>John Fox</hi> his Church lay hid in this time.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AND thus (having run over the firſt three Ages after Chriſt) we muſt now paſs to the ſecond ſtation, which is for other 300 years, beginning from <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Emperour downward unto the time of St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> under whom St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> came into <hi>England;</hi> in which ſpace of time the Catholic Chriſtian Church ſpread over all the World (as before you have heard) did grow, and confirm it ſelf powerfully, (eſpecially after Perſecution did ceaſe, as by all Stories appeareth) having had thirty-two Popes between <hi>Sylve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> and <hi>Gregory,</hi> whereof thirty were holden for great Saints, and three or four were Martyrs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Fathers and Doctors alſo of theſe three Ages were moſt excellent men both <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Latins;</hi> and it ſeemeth that what wanted in theſe three Ages from the former three in the Glory of Martyrdom, it was ſupply'd by the Excellency of Learning. As for Example; in the fourth Age after Chriſt, (which is the firſt of the ſecond three) did flouriſh <hi>Euſebius, Lactantius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Fathers, Doctors and Councils of the ſecond 300 years after Chriſt.</note>

All which filled the World with their excellent Books both <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin;</hi> beſides many General, National, and Provincial Councils; whereof five were Univerſal, the firſt of <hi>Nice,</hi> the ſecond of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> the third of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> the fourth of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> (wherein there were 630 Biſhops) and the fifth was of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> the ſecond time; but of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial and National Councils there are receiv'd to the number of almoſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty to have been held in this time.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By all which concourſe of Teſtimonies the Force and Unity of Catholic Faith is ſhewed, to wit, that theſe <hi>Fathers, Doctors, Popes,</hi>

Whereby this viſible Illuſtrious <hi>Roman</hi> Church was made ſo Great, and Univerſal, notorious and known, embracing all <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> as it is wholly impoſſible for <hi>John Fox</hi> to find out any creeping <hi>hidden Church</hi> bearing the name of Chriſtian in theſe three Ages, and yet different from this viſible and ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which he calleth the <hi>Devil's Chappel:</hi> And much more hard will it be for him to find out this in theſe latter three hundred years, than in the former; for that the external Glory of this Church was increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed much more in theſe three Ages, than in the firſt three before treated of, which paſſed all in Perſecution.</p>

                  </note> and for that <hi>John Fox</hi> is guilty to himſelf in this behalf, he hath proceeded accordingly in his <hi>Acts and Monuments:</hi> For whereas he promiſeth a ſeveral Book of theſe ſecond 300 years, under this Title; <hi>The ſecond Book,</hi>

                     <hi>John Fox</hi>'s ſhift to fill up this ſecond Book.</note> A ſhort Volume you will ſay for ſo great and copious an Argument.

                     <hi>An.</hi> 180.</note> and conſequently it ſhould have been told in his former Book by order of Time and Story; and then the other three leaves he ſpendeth in ſetting down the entrance of the <hi>Saxons</hi> into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> about the year of Chriſt 449, and the Succeſſion of their Pagan Kings unto St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi>'s coming. So as of all the foreſaid glorious Chriſtian Church for 300 years together, (to wit, from Pope <hi>Sylveſter</hi> and <hi>Conſtantine</hi> unto Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> and <hi>Mauritius</hi> the Emperour, wherein ſhe flouriſhed more than in any other three Ages) we find only five Leaves deſigned, but ſcarce three Lines performed: Whereby you may perceive how little part <hi>John Fox</hi> perſuadeth himſelf to have in theſe three Ages for his hidden Church. You may conſider alſo what an honeſt Bargainer he is, and how well he performeth his promiſe made in the firſt page of his whole Work, wherein he ſaith,<note place="margin">Fox in the Title of his Acts and Monuments.</note> 
                  <hi>That he will ſet forth at large the whole Race and Courſe of the Church, from the Primitive Age to theſe latter times of ours,</hi> &amp;c. whereof you ſee he hath performed nothing at all hitherto, either largely or briefly: I mean, of this Race or Courſe of any Church, General or Particular, Domeſtical or Foreign, Good or Bad, True or Falſe, His or Ours; for of the firſt 300 years he wrote only the ten Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions, as you have ſeen; and of the ſecond 300 years he writeth nothing at all.</p>

Which (if you conſider well) is a ſtrange confeſſion of his own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and poverty, ſeeing that theſe three Ages (to wit, the fourth, fifth, and ſixth) are the moſt abundant of matter that are to be found in the Church of Chriſt from the beginning; and ſo might he ſee by the Centuries of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters the <hi>Magdeburgians,</hi> who do enlarge themſelves much more in theſe three Ages than in the former, enforced thereunto by the multitude of matter, tho'

all againſt themſelves, as before hath been noted, and here will alſo appear; which <hi>John Fox</hi> well perceiving, thought beſt by ſlight of ſilence to avoid that inconvenience of treating a Hiſtory ſo apparently againſt himſelf. Which ſlight notwithſtanding (or rather flight) every man of mean underſtanding doth eaſily ſee, conſidering that (according to the Argument of his Book, and particular promiſe made before) he ſhould have declared to us, That the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of <hi>Britanny</hi> in theſe 300 years next before the entrance of St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> was for Him, and His Church, and not for Ours; yea, different from the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion brought in by <hi>Auguſtin,</hi>

But the <hi>Fox</hi> knowing the difficulty and peril of this Combat, would not enter into the ſame, nor take upon him to defend or juſtifie any thing at all, tho' never ſo much promiſed or proteſted in his Prefaces and Preambles at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning. Whereof the Reaſons are theſe that enſue.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Firſt, For that touching the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Church during theſe three Ages he had in truth nothing at all to write or relate, but what would be manifeſtly againſt himſelf, if he had written or related it, and deſcended to particulars. For (according to that you have heard before in divers places of this Treatiſe) that as the firſt Faith of the <hi>Britans</hi> came from <hi>Rome,</hi> and thereby they were made Members of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church from the beginning, ſo remained they united with the ſame in all points of Faith and Religion, (except ſome few abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes crept in among part of them, towards the latter-end of theſe three Ages) until the Converſion of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> by St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> to the ſame <hi>Roman</hi> Faith. Which point is proved ſo evidently by ſo many Signs,<note place="margin">Why <hi>Fox</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth nothing of the Church of <hi>Britanny</hi> in theſe three Ages.</note> Arguments, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations, as little comfort might <hi>John Fox</hi> have to enter into this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe or Examination; and conſequently, tho' he had promiſed in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to treat this Subject of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Church, yet coming to the place and time when he ſhould have performed his promiſe, he thought better to withdraw himſelf ſlightly by utter ſilence, than to put himſelf in Briars by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any mention at all thereof. And thus much for his ſilence concerning the Chriſtian Church of <hi>Britanny</hi> in theſe three Ages.</p>
               <p n="12">12. But for the general Catholic Church of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> tho' theſe times yield abundant matter, (as hath been ſaid) yet the whole ſtream and current thereof running quite againſt him, he thought beſt in like manner to decline craftily the medling or wreſtling therewith: And ſo much the more, for that he had ſeen the pitiful plight wherein his Maſters the <hi>Magdeburgians</hi> had caſt themſelves in their fourth, fifth, and ſixth Centuries, by over-large relating the Acts and Geſts of theſe three Ages againſt themſelves and their own Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; being forc'd to ſpend a great part of their Labors not ſo much in relating what the Fathers of thoſe Ages writ or held, as to anſwer and refute the ſame, and ſhew that it was not true, nor the ſaid Doctors and Fathers to be believed therein. Which trouble <hi>John Fox</hi> (like a wily <hi>Fox</hi> indeed) thought beſt to avoid by Art of Silence. I will in this place, for examples ſake only, and to give you a taſte of the ſaid <hi>Magdeburgians</hi> dealing throughout their whole Work, (from which <hi>John Fox</hi> taketh the principal parts of his) let you ſee ſome points taken out of their fourth Century, dedicated to her Majeſty of <hi>England,</hi> with a
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:104638:68"/>
ſharp Invective (as before hath been ſhewed) uſed by them againſt the <hi>Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> therein; which Century containeth the fourth Hundred year after Chriſt,<note place="margin">Exc. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>5.</hi> ſup. p. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>6.</hi>
                  </note> and the firſt of the three which now we have in hand, from <hi>Conſtantine</hi> down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; wherein they ſpend above 400 Leaves in Folio, and more than twice as much in the other two Centuries that enſue; <hi>John Fox</hi> not having beſtow'd four Leaves upon all three Ages, as you have heard.</p>
               <p n="13">13. And that you may perceive how this one Century of the <hi>Magdeburgians</hi> cometh to make ſo great a Volume, you muſt note, that it is divided into cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain large Chapters or Heads of different matters. As for example; firſt,<note place="margin">The ſubſtance and method of the <hi>Magdebur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians Centuries.</hi>
                  </note> of the propagation of Chriſtian Religion in that Age, and the State thereof throughout all Countreys, Kingdoms and Nations; which is a large matter, as you ſee, comprehending the Stories of all Eccleſiaſtical Writers.

Then of Doctrin, good or bad; then of Hereſies; then of Rites and Ceremonies; then of Eccleſiaſtical Government; then of Schiſms; then of Synods and Councils; then of Biſhops, Doctors and Teachers, their Lives, Works, and Actions at large; then of Heretics, their beginnings and endings; then of Martyrs; then of Miracles; then of Pagan Commonwealths alſo; and other ſuch points capable, as you ſee, of long Diſcourſes: Which I thought fit once to note, to the end that thoſe which have not read the Centuries may know in general what matters they handle, and what method they uſe therein.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Secondly, it is to be noted about the ſame affair, That in all theſe Heads and Chapters there be divers things which are not in controverſie among us, I mean between Catholics and Proteſtants, but are common to us both, at leaſt in ſome degrees. Other Points there are, that they affirm and we deny, or we affirm and they deny. There is a third kind alſo of Points, wherein, tho' We and Proteſtants do not agree fully, either in the Doctrin or in the Practice, yet one Sect of them differeth more or leſs from us than the other. And in all theſe three Points you ſhall ſee ſome brief Examples of the <hi>Magde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgians</hi> manner of proceeding in this fourth Age: Noting to you firſt by the way their own Teſtimony of the excellent Learning of the Doctors and Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers thereof in theſe words: <hi>Habuit haec aet as, ſi quae unquam alia,</hi>

                  <hi>plurimos prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantes &amp; illuſtres Doctores, ut</hi> Arnobium, Lactantium, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This Age (if ever any other) had very many moſt excellent and famous Doctors, as <hi>Arnobius, Lactantius, Euſebius, Athanaſius, Hilarius, Victorinus, Baſilius, Nazianzenus, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſius, Prudentius, Epiphanius, Theophilus, Hieronymus, Fauſtinus, Didymus, Ephrem, Optatus,</hi> and others; out of which we ſhall ſhew and declare what was the form of Chriſtian Doctrin uſed in this Age.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Lo there the Teſtimony of the <hi>Magdeburgians</hi> of the famous Doctors, Teachers, and Leaders of Chriſt's Church in this Age! And being ſuch as they ſay, ſo excellently Learned, and endued with Chriſt's Spirit for Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of his Church; is it probable (think you) that theſe four <hi>German Magde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgians, Illyricus, Wigandus, Judex</hi> and <hi>Faber,</hi> ſhall come to preſume after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to condemn them all of Ignorance and lack of Spirit, when they ſpeak againſt them? Truly they cannot do it with any ſhame fac'dneſs or modeſty at all, or be believed by any diſcreet man, if they do it. Well then, let us examin this point a little.</p>
               <p n="16">16. In their Chapter of Doctrin, when they talk of theſe Points, of <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>B. Trinity,</hi> of <hi>Three diſtinct Perſons,</hi> of the <hi>Natures and Wills of Chriſt,</hi> and other ſuch matter, (wherein They and We do not differ) they alledge theſe Fathers abundantly: And no marvel, for as long as they teach Catholic Doctrin, they have all the Fathers Works and Volumes for them; but when they touch any Point wherein there is controverſie between us, there they fall out preſently
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:104638:69"/>
with the ſaid Fathers for holding againſt them. As for example, in one Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph of this Chapter and Doctrin, (which Paragraph is, <hi>de lib. Arbitrio</hi>) they begin it thus:<note place="margin">
                     <p>About Free-will.</p>
                     <p>

                  <hi>De lib.

Wherein they cenſure firſt (as you ſee) all Doctors of this Age, ſo greatly extolled by them before, as tho' they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered many things incommodious and intolerable about Free-will; as indeed afterwards in another Chapter,<note place="margin">Ib. pag. <hi>287,</hi> &amp; <hi>291.</hi>
                  </note> entituled, <hi>The declining of true Doctrin, (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the incommodious Opinions and Errors of theſe Doctors)</hi> they ſpeak more plainly thus: <hi>Patres omnes ferè hujus aetatis de lib. Arbitrio confusè loquuntur, &amp; contra manifeſta Scripturae fanctae teſtimonia;</hi> Almoſt all the Fathers of this Age do ſpeak confuſedly of Free-will, and againſt the manifeſt teſtimonies of holy Scripture. And for proof of this they name in particular <hi>Lactantius, Athanaſius, Baſil, Nazianzen, Epiphanius, Hieronymus,</hi> and <hi>Gregorius Nyſſenus;</hi> condemning them all, for not denying altogether Free-will in man after his Fall.</p>
               <p n="17">
                  <note place="margin">Cent. <hi>4.</hi> p. <hi>231.</hi>
                  </note>17. Again, in the ſame Chapter of Doctrin, and Paragraph <hi>de Poenitentia,</hi> they begin thus: <hi>Doctrinam de Poenitentia, ut gravis per ſeſe, &amp; magni eſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menti, ita ſatis tenuiter &amp; frigidè (quantum quidem ex ſcriptis ejus videre eſt) quemadmodum &amp; in ſuperioribus ſaeculis tractatam videas ab hac aetate: Nos igitur ea, quae de hac parte mediocriter &amp; rectè, &amp; utiliter dicta eſſe videntur recitabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus:</hi> 
                  <q>The Doctrin of Penance, as it is a grave matter in it ſelf, and of great importance, ſo we do ſee it handled by this Age (as alſo by the former Ages) very ſlightly and coldly, as we may ſee by their Writings extant: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſhall recite here thoſe things only of this matter, which ſeem unto us to have been ſpoken by the ſaid Fathers with ſome mediocrity, rectitude, and utility, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> See now their Judgment and Cenſure of all the Fathers, not only of this Age, but of all the former Ages alſo ſince Chriſt, as having written both ſlightly and coldly! And yet further, in another Chapter of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining Doctrin,<note place="margin">Cent. <hi>4.</hi> c. <hi>4.</hi>
                  </note> they ſay, <hi>Poenitentiam haec aetas (ut ferè &amp; ſuperiores) neque rectè definiit, neque partes ejus ſatis explicavit; imò nec de Fide (neceſſaria Poeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiae parte) propemodùm aliquid habet:</hi> 
                  <q>This fourth Age, as neither the other three before, have either given the true definition of Penance, nor ſufficiently declared the parts thereof; nay they ſpeak nothing almoſt of Faith, which yet is a neceſſary part of Penance.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="18">18. Thus they pronounce boldly of all the Ages ſince Chriſt, not excepting that of the Apoſtles themſelves, And who can ſuffer ſo wicked a ſlander, as tho' they had made no mention of Faith at all, or as tho' when they preſcribe Faſting, Prayer, Sorrow, and Tears to Penance, they excluded Faith? where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is evident, even unto Children, that no man can perform theſe things, except he have firſt Faith, and do believe in him whom he ſeeketh to pleaſe and pacifie. I ſay nothing here of the intolerable Injuries and falſe Calumnia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which they do infer upon the holy Fathers, without all cauſe, if their words were examined. As for example, in this very place, they condemn St. <hi>Ephrem,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cent. <hi>4.</hi> p. <hi>294.</hi> Ephr. l. <hi>2.</hi> de compunctione cordis, c. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> for depraving Penance, and excluding Faith from the ſame, for that he ſaith, <hi>Per lachrymas hujus breviſſimi temporis peccata (Deus) dimittit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Et, cum ſanaverit, mercedem conferet lachrymarum;</hi> 
                  <q>God (ſaith this Saint) doth pardon our ſins by our tears ſhed in this ſhort time of our life; and, when he hath healed us, he will give us a reward alſo for our tears Who ſeeth not but that this holy Father ſuppoſeth Faith in him that doth weep, and conſequently is not ſubject to the wicked ſlander of the <hi>Magdebur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians,</hi> affirming him to exclude Faith?</q> Yet thus they uſe both Him and all Fathers lightly, when they cite them, to refute their Sentences;
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:104638:69"/>
alledging them commonly with ſome falſe Calumniation. But let us go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
               <p n="19">19. When they come to ſpeak of the Doctrin of the Bleſſed <hi>Sacrament and Real Preſence</hi> (for that in this they hold with us againſt the Sacramentaries,<note place="margin">The bleſſed Sacrament. <hi>Cent.</hi> 4. <hi>pag.</hi> 242. <hi>Ambr. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de Sacr. c.</hi> 4.</note> and <hi>Calviniſts</hi>) they do Cite the Fathers abundantly. As that of St. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe: Didiciſti, quia quod accipis corpus Chriſti eſt.</hi> Thou haſt learned, that the thing which thou receiveſt, is the Body of Chriſt. And again: <hi>Bibi ſanguinem è Chriſto, ìdque in veritate, non in umbra aut ſimilitudine.</hi> I have drunk the Blood of Chriſt, and that in truth not in a ſhadow or ſimilitude. And then out of St. <hi>Hillary: Si verè verbum caro factum eſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hil. l. <hi>8.</hi> de Trinitate.</note> 
                  <hi>&amp; nos verè verbum carnem cibo dominico ſumimus.</hi> 
                  <q>If the word of God be truly made Fleſh, then do we truly receive that Fleſh in the Lords Supper.</q> And further they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege St. <hi>Hierom, Arnobius, Juvencus,</hi> and others of this Age, that have the like Teſtimonies, and clear Speeches for proof of this verity. Which do ſeem to them ſo ſtrong and manifeſt demonſtrations againſt the <hi>Zwinglian,</hi> and <hi>Calvinian</hi> Doctrin, avowing to the contrary, That they hold them for obſtinatly blind, that deny or reſiſt the ſame. And this, for that the Doctrin pleaſeth them. But if we ſtep a foot further to the Doctrin of this Bleſſed <hi>Sacrament</hi> made alſo <hi>a Sacrifice,</hi> and ſo teſtified by the ſame Fathers, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the Real Preſence: Then our good <hi>Magdeburgians,</hi> that commended them ſo highly before, do flatly leave both them and us, and do place their ſayings in their other Chapter of incommodious Speeches. Accompting them for Straw, and Stubble, and Erroneous Doctrin. <hi>Incommode dictum eſt;</hi> (ſay they) <hi>quòd citatur ex Athanaſii libello, &amp;c.</hi> 
                  <q>It was ſpoken incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiouſly by <hi>Athanaſius</hi> in his Book of the Image of Chriſt, where he deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth expreſly that there is any thing remaining in this World of the Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt, but only that which is dayly made Spiritually by the hands of Prieſts upon the Altar.</q> It is a new phraſe alſo of <hi>Nazianzen,</hi>

                  <q>We do believe that the Bread which is Sanctified by the word of God, is by the ſame word of God changed into the Body of the Son of God.</q>

Wherefore I will leave the Reader to conſider, what manner of people theſe <hi>Lutheran</hi> Writers are, who do record ſo many important Teſtimonies againſt themſelves; and having alledged them, then they refute all again pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently with this bare ſhift, that they are either <hi>Jewiſh</hi> or <hi>Pagan</hi> Ceremonies brought in by the Fathers upon Superſtition, and ſo not to be regarded; and this they think to be ſufficient to refute them all. As for Example,<note place="margin">The ancient obſervation of Faſts.</note> talking of the Ceremony of Faſting in thoſe days, what Meats they did eat, and how ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly they abſtained, and how long, theſe good fellows do write thus: <hi>Jejunia obſervaſſe religioſiùs, quidem ſeu ſuperſtitioſiùs, quàm ſuperioribus ſaeculis hujus aetatis Chriſtianos Hiſtoriae teſtantur;</hi> 
                  <q>Hiſtories do teſtifie unto us, that the Chriſtians of this Age did obſerve Faſting-days more religiouſly, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more ſuperſtitiouſly, than any Age before, for that Human Traditions began now to be more multiplied; and <hi>Epiphanius</hi> doth ſay, that the Faſt of <hi>Wedneſdays</hi> and <hi>Fridays</hi> was obſerved at this time, as a <hi>Tradition of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi> but we find no ſuch thing in their Works.</q> Thus ſaid theſe <hi>Germans,</hi> that never perhaps faſted a day in their life, nor ever abſtained for Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on-ſake from any good morſel of Meat, that their Lips could reach unto. And ſo much of theſe men, for they are not worth the ſpending of time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute them.</p>
               <p>Well then, by theſe few Examples taken out of two Chapters only of the <hi>Magdeburgians</hi> about this fourth Age, we ſee what may be gathered, if we would go over all the three Centuries for theſe three Ages (from <hi>Conſtantine</hi> to St. <hi>Gregory;</hi>) and thereby alſo we ſee the reaſon why <hi>Fox</hi> wrote ſo little of theſe three Ages, being wholly againſt them.</p>
               <p n="28">28. But now perhaps the Reader will ask, how it falleth out that <hi>John Fox</hi> having dedicated a ſpecial Book (to wit, his ſecond of <hi>Acts and Monuments</hi>) unto theſe three Ages after <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> (for ſo is his Title:) how, I ſay,<note place="margin">Fox p. <hi>95.</hi>
                  </note> he could make up a diſtinct Book, and yet ſay nothing of the Eccleſiaſtical Affairs
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:104638:71"/>
therein contained?<note place="margin">How <hi>Fox</hi> fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth up his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Book with matter not to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</note> Whereunto I anſwer, That this is another Foxly fetch of his, to promiſe and not perform, and to do one thing for another; for that deſpairing to have matter to his purpoſe out of the former three Ages (as hath been ſhewed) he ſlideth away ſlightly to another Argument, which he had not promiſed in his Title; to wit, of ſome things fallen out in our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church in the next 200 years after, from the time of St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> and King <hi>Ethelbert,</hi> unto the time of King <hi>Egbert,</hi> firſt Monarch of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> about the year of Chriſt 800. But for that theſe two Ages, (to wit, the ſeventh and eighth) do contain the times of our primitive <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church, I think beſt to treat ſeverally thereof in the next Chapter following; this being ſufficient to ſhew, that in theſe ſecond 300 years <hi>John Fox</hi> had as little room for his Church, as in the former.</p>

But (as you have heard before) he finding ſcarce any thing in theſe two Ages, which delighted his heretical humor, no not our very Converſion it ſelf from Paganiſm to Chriſtian Religion, he ſhuffleth the ſame over in the end of his foreſaid ſecond Book, together with the ſecond 300 years after Chriſt, from <hi>Conſtantine</hi> to Pope <hi>Gregory,</hi> as before hath been ſhewed. So as he includeth the Acts of 500 years of the moſt Famous and Glorious Times that ever were in the Church of God, (whether we reſpect the General and Univerſal Church, or the Church of <hi>England</hi> in particular) in a little Book of a dozen Leaves only,<note place="margin">Why <hi>Jo.

               <p n="5">5.

               <p n="10">10. Thus far I thought good to ſet down the Decrees of theſe two Synods of the firſt two Ages of our primitive Church in the words themſelves of <hi>John Fox;</hi> whereby you might ſee, or at leaſtwiſe make ſome gueſs of the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Vertue of theſe times, which <hi>Fox</hi> endeavoreth by all means to bring in contempt. Which point, (I mean of their Learning, Piety, and Godly So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitude for governing our new-founded Church of <hi>England</hi>) would more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently have appeared by theſe two Synods, if this lying Hiſtoriographer had

not uſed here alſo his too <hi>Fox</hi> like tricks of falſifying and fraudulent omiſſion of other things, which he ſhould have related. For better underſtanding of theſe which he hath here ſet down, I ſhall ſpeak a word or two of them briefly; for it were infinit to follow him in all theſe traces, turnings, and wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of his.</p>

Firſt then, touching the former Council or Synod held by <hi>Theodorus</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and related by St. <hi>Bede</hi> (for of this only will I treat for brevities ſake, to ſhew an Example thereby how you may truſt <hi>John Fox</hi> in the reſt which he writeth) theſe points may be noted: Firſt, That whereas he ſaith, that this Synod was held in the year of Chriſt 680, and quoteth <hi>Bede</hi> for the ſame in his Margin, he falſifieth him plainly; for that <hi>Bede</hi>'s words are theſe, ſet down at length.</p>
               <p>

               <p n="12">12. Secondly, <hi>Fox</hi> writeth thus of the place: <hi>In the time of this</hi> Theodorus <hi>a Provincial Synod was held at</hi> Thetford, <hi>mentioned in the Story of</hi> Bede. But he that will read St. <hi>Bede</hi> himſelf, ſhall find theſe words: <hi>In loco qui dicitur</hi> Herudfrod;<note place="margin">Bed. l. <hi>4.</hi> c. <hi>5.</hi> Cambd. in deſc. Britan. Com.

               </p>
               <p n="13">13. But thirdly, there follow more malicious changings and falſifications in citing the Articles themſelves of this Synod; whereof he ſcarce relateth any one without ſome alteration, as each man may ſee that will compare them with the Original of St. <hi>Bede</hi> himſelf. I ſhall touch for example the firſt and the laſt of the ten, for that they have more expreſs malice in them than the reſt, which I do let paſs.</p>
               <p n="14">
                  <note place="margin">Fox p. <hi>112.</hi>
                  </note>14. The firſt Decree of this Synod was, ſaith <hi>Fox, That</hi> Eaſter-day <hi>ſhould be uniformly kept and obſerv'd throughout the whole Realm, upon one certain day,</hi> viz. prima 14 Luna Menſis primi; that is to ſay, upon the firſt 14 Moon, or day of the Moon of the firſt Month, to wit, of <hi>March.</hi> Which is juſt as the <hi>Jews</hi> do obſerve it, againſt the Uſe and Cuſtom of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and is an old condemn'd Error and Hereſie, as before you have heard diſcuſs'd at large in the ſecond, third, and fourth Chapters of this Treatiſe. And you muſt note that <hi>Fox</hi> maketh this Decree to ſay, that this fourteenth Moon, or fourteenth day of the firſt Moon of <hi>March,</hi> (for this is the phraſe of Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Calculation, to ſay, <hi>Luna prima, Luna ſecunda, Luna tertia,</hi> for the firſt, ſecond, or third day of the Moon) muſt be <hi>certain,</hi> or certainly obſerved, ſo as it may not be alter'd, nor <hi>Eaſter</hi> obſerv'd upon any other day; wherein ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the formality of the former Error, as hath been declared, for that it putteth a neceſſity of obſerving the old <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Law, and thereby doth evacuate the force of Chriſt's Grace and Goſpel, as you have heard before diſcuſſed. Which being ſo, will you eaſily believe that the whole Church of <hi>England</hi> could be brought to decree ſuch an Error in a public Council, and that St. <hi>Bede</hi> in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular would ever relate the ſame with his approbation, ſeeing he miſlik'd the ſame ſo greatly in ſome of the <hi>Britans,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sup. c. <hi>2, 3, 4.</hi>
                  </note> as in the former Chapters of this Treatiſe we have declared?</p>
               <p n="15">
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:104638:73"/>15. Well then, let us ſee what the words of St. <hi>Bede</hi> himſelf are in this Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodical Decree corrupted by <hi>Fox: Primum Capitulum,</hi> (ſaith he,<note place="margin">Bed. l. <hi>4.</hi> hiſt. c. <hi>5.</hi>
                  </note> relating it out of the words of the Canons themſelves) <hi>ut ſanctum diem</hi> Paſchae <hi>in commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni omnes ſervemus, Dominica poſt</hi> 14 <hi>Lunam primi Menſis;</hi> 
                  <q>The firſt Article of our Decrees (ſaith the Council) is, that we do all in common obſerve the holy day of <hi>Eaſter</hi> upon the Sunday next after the fourteenth Moon of the firſt Month.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="16">16. Thus ſaith the Decree, truly related by St. <hi>Bede,</hi> quite contrary to that which <hi>Fox</hi> related before; he putting out and putting in of his own,<note place="margin">The wicked falſifying of S. <hi>Bede</hi> by <hi>Fox.</hi>
                  </note> without ſhame or conſcience, what he thought beſt in this little Sentence, to make thoſe Fathers ſeem to ſay (as he would have them) in favor of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd Hereſie. To which effect he putteth out (as you have ſeen) the word <hi>Dominica,</hi> which maketh or marreth all the matter, and then for <hi>poſt</hi> 14 <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam,</hi> written at large in St. <hi>Bede,</hi> he putteth in <hi>prima</hi> 14 <hi>Luna,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Fox</hi> is taken in his malicious dealing about the Decree of Obſervation of <hi>Eaſter.</hi>
                  </note> ſhort in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers only, to make it more obſcure, adding <hi>prima</hi> of his own, and putting out <hi>poſt</hi> from the words of the Council, thereby to make the ſenſe more clear in favor of the Hereſie; for that <hi>prima</hi> 14 <hi>Luna Menſis primi</hi> (which are his words) do ſignifie the fourteenth day of the firſt Moon of <hi>March</hi> expreſly. And moreover, he addeth of his own theſe words, <hi>upon one certain day,</hi> which the Decree hath not; meaning thereby, that this fourteenth day muſt be obſerved with ſuch <hi>certainty,</hi> as it may not be altered or deferred to any <hi>Sunday,</hi> but muſt be obſerved as an immovable Feaſt; which out of <hi>Luther</hi> we have ſhewed before alſo to be his meaning.<note place="margin">Sup. c. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> And thus much of the firſt Decree.</p>
               <p n="17">17. The laſt and tenth Decree hath no leſs fraud and malice uſed againſt it by <hi>Fox</hi> than this firſt; for the malicious ſhameleſs Fellow would make thoſe Fathers of that Synod to favor the Doctrin and Practice of the Proteſtants in putting away their Wives for Fornication, and marrying another: for to this effect he citeth the Canon. <hi>Tenthly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Fox</hi> 112.</note> 
                  <hi>That no man may put away his Wife for any cauſe, except only for Fornication, after the Rule of the Goſpel:</hi> And there break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth off, as tho' the Council had ſaid no more, nor added any further caution or explication of their meaning. Whereof it would enſue (as Proteſtants do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer) that ſeeing a man may put away one Wife for Fornication,<note place="margin">About marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſecond Wife, the firſt being alive.</note> and is not bound to live unmarried, if he have not the gift of Continency he may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully take another Wife, as the practice of Proteſtants is at this day in <hi>England.</hi> But the Reader muſt know, that immediatly after the former words by him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, there follow in the Canon others that mar all his Market; for thus they lie together.</p>
               <p n="18">18. <hi>Nullus conjugem propriam,</hi>

                  <q>Let no man leave his own Wife, but only, as the holy Goſpel teacheth us, for the cauſe of Fornication; and if any man ſhould put away his Wife that is joyned unto him by lawful Marriage, if he will be a true Chriſtian let him not marry another, but either remain ſo in Continency, or be reconciled to his own Wife a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="19">19. Lo here the fidelity of <hi>John Fox</hi> in relating matters! This Canon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termineth two things, you ſee: Firſt, That a man may not leave the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany or cohabitation of his Wife, but only for the ſin of Fornication committed by her: The ſecond, That being ſo ſeparated, he may not marry another for any cauſe, but either muſt remain continent, or be reconcil'd to his former Wife again. And this was the Doctrin of the Catholic Church then, and is now; which our <hi>Fox</hi> would fain have concealed from his Reader, and have
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:104638:74"/>
made him believe, that the old primitive <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church had been for Them and their Practice at this day. But the poor <hi>Reynard</hi> is taken at every win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, when he is followed, which were impoſſible to do in all his falſe doublings. And ſo theſe two Examples only ſhall ſuffice to ſhew his tricks in this firſt point of Falſification. Let us paſs to the ſecond of wilful Omiſſion.</p>

There remaineth to ſay a word or two of his Omiſſions, whereby he leaveth out of purpoſe from his Story thoſe things which might give Credit or Reputation to our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church in theſe ancient times, which he ſeeketh by all means to make ridiculous and contemptible. As for Example, the Number and Quality of the Prelates and Learned Men that then flouriſhed, and were preſent in theſe Synods; the Reaſons, and Arguments, and other like Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, partly ſet down by St. <hi>Bede</hi> and other Authors upon divers occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and partly regiſtred in the very Prefaces of the Synods themſelves.

               <p n="25">25. Behold here the manner and form of Catholic Councils of old time; who laid down firſt the Goſpel in the midſt, and then after due examination of Scriptures, conſidered that Antiquity of Fathers and Councils had determined in God's Church before them, even from Chriſt and his Apoſtles downward; and therein inſiſted, agreeing all in one, and rejecting and accurſing all new, contrary or different Doctrins and Doctors; and by his means, and by the aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt promiſed by Chriſt unto his Church, hath ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued now for 1600 years one and the ſelf-ſame; whereas Sectaries lacking this Humility, Wiſdom, and Subordination, but eſpecially God's Grace, are divided and conſumed among themſelves.</p>

Firſt then, concerning the general <hi>Roman</hi> Church, it continued in theſe Ages, as in the former, by continual Succeſſion of her Biſhops and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, altering nothing in Belief and Doctrin from her Anceſtors. And briefly to repeat the ſum of all, there ruled in the See of <hi>Rome</hi> in theſe two Ages and an half, (as ſupreme, known, and acknowledged Paſtors of this great viſible Church) ſome ſixty Popes, from <hi>Leo</hi> III. that crowned <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, (and thereby reſtor'd the Weſtern Empire) unto the time of <hi>Alexander</hi> II. under whom Duke <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Normandy</hi> conquered <hi>England.</hi> And in the Weſtern Empire there reigned ſome eighteen Emperours in this ſpace, from <hi>Charles</hi> the Great to <hi>Henry</hi> IV. and in the Eaſtern Empire ſome twenty five, from <hi>Nicepho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> I. to <hi>Conſtantine</hi> X. All which Popes, Emperours and Princes were of one Religion, Faith and Belief in thoſe days. And albeit ſoon after the See of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and <hi>Greek Church,</hi> by occaſion of Emulation againſt the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, did begin to withdraw their due Obedience from the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and thereby fell by little and little into divers errors of Doctrin alſo, and finally were delivered over (as all the World ſeeth) into the Subjection and Servitude of the <hi>Turks;</hi> yet in theſe Ages there was Union and due Subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between both Churches:<note place="margin">The eighth General Council.</note> Which may appear by that one only General Council being held at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> (even againſt <hi>Phocius,</hi> that was Patriarch of the ſaid City) being gathered by order of Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> II. and <hi>Baſilius</hi> the <hi>Grecian</hi> Emperour concurring therein. This Council was of 300 Biſhops, and confirmed by the ſaid Pope <hi>Adrian,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">An. Dom. <hi>870.</hi>
                  </note> being the eighth General Council in order, and the fourth of thoſe that were held in <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> Whereby it cometh alſo to be noted, That all the General Councils held hitherto in the Chriſtian Church (for the ſpace of 900 years) being eight in number, as hath been ſaid, from the firſt Council of <hi>Nice</hi> unto this, and from this to the firſt General Council of <hi>Lateran,</hi> holden in the year of Chriſt 1115, under Pope <hi>Innocentius</hi> III. were all held in <hi>Greece,</hi> but yet by order of the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſending thither their Legats, and confirming the ſame afterwards by themſelves, without which confirmation they were never held for Lawful in the Chriſtian World; which is no ſmall Argument of the Greatneſs and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> from time to time.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It ſhall not be needful to ſpeak of the particular Hereſies of theſe two or three Ages, which in effect were none of any name, but only two,<note place="margin">The Hereſies of theſe Ages.</note> the <hi>Icono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claſts,</hi> or Image-breakers, and the <hi>Berengarians,</hi> or Sacramentaries, both of them agreeing in their particular Hereſies with the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> of our Times, tho' in many other things different, as it is wont to be. The firſt of them was begun before theſe Times by <hi>Leo</hi> III. Emperour of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> ſirnamed <hi>Iſaurus,</hi> about the year of Chriſt 750, as before hath been noted, and renewed again by <hi>Claudius Taurinenſis.</hi> The ſecond was begun 300 years after by <hi>Berengarius,</hi> about the year of Chriſt 1050, and abjured by him again, as hereafter ſhall be ſhewed.</p>
               <p>The chief Doctors and Fathers that defended true Religion in theſe Ages were <hi>Turpinus, Eginhardus, Haymo, Rabanus, Frecolphus, Hincmarus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Fathers and Doctors of theſe Times.</note> 
                  <hi>Jo.

               <p n="4">4. And this was the ſtate of the Univerſal Chriſtian Church in theſe Ages; whereunto in all reſpects was conform the particular Church of <hi>England,</hi> as the Daughter to her Mother; which may be demonſtrated partly by the continual Deſcent of Archbiſhops in <hi>England,</hi> which were to the number of Sixteen,<note place="margin">The Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi> in theſe Ages.</note> from <hi>Celnothus</hi> that lived with King <hi>Egbert,</hi> unto <hi>Stigand</hi> that poſſeſſed the See of <hi>Canterbury</hi> when <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror came in, tho' afterward he cauſed
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:104638:76"/>
him to be depoſed by a Commiſſion from <hi>Rome,</hi> in the year of Chriſt 1070, as <hi>John Stow</hi> and others do note.</p>
               <p n="5">5. I do pretermit the Succeſſion of other Biſhoprics in <hi>England</hi> for Brevities ſake;<note place="margin">Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in this Time.</note> the Kings alſo of <hi>England</hi> that poſſeſſed that Crown from <hi>Egbert</hi> to <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> the Conqueror were ſome Twenty in number, (if we count <hi>Canutus</hi> the <hi>Dane</hi> and his two Children among the reſt.) All which Kings, of what Nation or State ſoever, agreed fully in Faith and Belief with the ſaid Archbiſhops and Biſhops of our Land, and They again with the whole Univerſal <hi>Roman</hi> Church, as appeareth by their Acts and Monuments, and <hi>John Fox</hi> alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Which being ſo, it is hard to ſay or imagin where <hi>John Fox</hi> in theſe Ages will pick out a different Chriſtian Church (tho' it be never ſo <hi>poor</hi> and <hi>creeping</hi>) for Him and His, either <hi>in England</hi> or <hi>out of England,</hi> during this time. And much more hard it is to think how he can deviſe any viſible Continuation of the ſaid <hi>obſcure and trodden-down Church</hi> (as he promiſed to do) even from the Apoſtles Time to our Age.<note place="margin">Fox in proteſt. ad Eccl. Angl. pag. <hi>10.</hi>
                  </note> His only refuge muſt be (as before we have often noted) to run to the condemned Heretics of theſe times, if he find any for his purpoſe. Which yet he dareth not openly to do, as you have ſeen throughout all the former Ages: But afterward, when he cometh near home, to wit, after Pope <hi>Innocentius</hi> III. and <hi>John Wickliff,</hi> he taketh more heart, affirming Our Church to have utterly periſhed, and a new viſible Off-ſpring of his Church to have ſtarted up; to wit, all the Sectaries and Heretics caſt out and condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of our Church, as you ſhall ſee more particularly when we come to that place.</p>
               <p n="7">7. For the preſent Ages that we are now in, he doth not ſo much as lay hands upon the <hi>Iconoclaſts</hi> or <hi>Berengarians,</hi> nor doth ſeem to count them for his Brethren, tho' in the principal Points of their Hereſies they agree with Him, as is notorious. And <hi>John Fox,</hi> to have ſome viſible Members of his Church in theſe Ages, ought to have ſhaken hands with them; but the poor Fellow was aſham'd to build his Church openly of ſo ancient Heretics; tho' after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, when he beginneth to build indeed, and to gather Stones together, he calleth for the <hi>Berengarians</hi> again which now he caſteth away, as after you ſhall ſee.</p>
               <p n="8">8. But now perhaps you will ask me, If <hi>John Fox</hi> do ſet down no Succeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in theſe Ages (as neither in the former of His Church or Ours,) what doth the ſimple Fellow in all this third Book of his? Whereto I anſwer firſt, That albeit he promiſeth in the Title,<note place="margin">What <hi>Fox</hi> handleth in theſe 300 years.</note> That this third Book ſhall contain <hi>the Acts and Monuments of</hi> 300 <hi>years, together with the whole race and courſe of the Church,</hi> &amp;c. yet hath the whole Book but ſeventeen Leaves in all, which is little more than one Leaf to every twenty years race and courſe of the whole Church. And ſurely, he that ſo courſeth over an Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, may be called rather a Courſer indeed, than an Hiſtoriographer.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Nay further, he is ſo envious to the famous Acts of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church in theſe days, (eſpecially with Foreign Nations) as he either concealeth ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly the ſame, or maketh reproachful mention thereof.

Truly I think he dareth not ſay ſo; for that it is evident it were a plain cavil: the only inconvenience of that caſe being (if it ſhould fall out) that the Church ſhould lack a true Head for the time, as ſhe doth when any Pope dieth until another be choſen. And whatſoever inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience can be imagined in this caſe, is more againſt the Proteſtants than Us; for that their Church admitteth for lawful and ſupreme Head thereof either Man or Woman, which our Church doth not.

               <p n="22">22.

               <p n="23">23. But if we go to more ancient Writers, ſuch (I mean) as lived in the very time or ſoon after the matter is pretended to have fallen out; that is to ſay, with <hi>Leo</hi> IV. that held the See eight years, ſix months, and three days, from the year of Chriſt 847, to 855; and with Pope <hi>Benedictus</hi> III. that imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately followed him after ſome few days of vacancy, to wit, from the year 855, to 858. Theſe Authors, I ſay, do ſhew evidently, that theſe two Popes, being both <hi>Romans,</hi> ſucceeded immediately one after another, without any <hi>John</hi> or <hi>Joan</hi> coming in between them.

               </p>
               <p n="28">28. But beſides all this, there enſueth another Argument more evident (in my Opinion) than any of the reſt hitherto alleged, for overthrowing of this Fable; which is, That about 170 years after this deviſed Election of Pope <hi>Joan,</hi> (to wit, upon the year of Chriſt 1020) the Church and Patriarchs of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> being in ſome Contention with <hi>Rome,</hi> Pope <hi>Leo</hi> IX. wrote a long Letter to <hi>Michaell</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> reprehending certain abuſes of that Church,<note place="margin">A moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt the Fable of Pope <hi>Joan.</hi>
                  </note> and among other that they were ſaid to have promoted Eunuchs to Prieſthood, and thereby alſo a greater inconvenience fallen out, which was, that a Woman had crept in to be Patriarch; which yet he ſaith that for the horror of the Fact he would not believe. <hi>Abſit</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ut velimus credere quod publica fama non dubitat aſſerere,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epiſt. Leon. <hi>9.</hi> cap. <hi>5.</hi> &amp; <hi>23.</hi>
                  </note> &amp;c. <hi>God forbid we ſhould believe that which public Fame doubteth not to affirm, which is, that the Church of</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople, <hi>by promoting Eunuchs to Prieſthood (againſt the Canon of the Council of</hi> Nice) <hi>promoted once a Woman to the Biſhops See, which is ſo abominable a thing, as the horror thereof doth not permit us to believe it,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="29">29. Thus wrote he; which no doubt he would never have dar'd to do, if the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> might have returned the matter back upon him again, and ſaid, This was but a ſlanderous report falſly raiſed againſt the Church of <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> but that a Woman indeed had been promoted in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. How could Pope <hi>Leo</hi> have anſwered this Reply? Wherefore moſt certain it ſeemeth that at this time there was not ſo much as any rumour or mention of any Woman Pope that ever had been in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, this being 250 years before <hi>Martinus Polonus</hi> wrote;<note place="margin">A probable conjecture of the firſt Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin of this Fable of Pope <hi>Joan.</hi>

               <p n="30">30. Finally, howſoever this be of the firſt occaſion or invention of the Fable, certain it is that moſt evidently it is a Fable; and that, if other Arguments failed, yet there be ſo many Incongruities, Simplicities, Abſurdities, Varieties, and Contrarieties in the very Narration it ſelf, as it diſcovers the whole matter to be a meer Fable and Fiction indeed, and a rumour of vulgar people, without ground.<note place="margin">Mart.

               <p n="32">32.

                  </note> and that ſhe went with an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Monk out of the Abbey of <hi>Fulda</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi> to <hi>Athens, and there ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died in Mans Apparel:</hi> whereas it is known that <note n="*" place="margin">

                  </note> 
                  <hi>Athens</hi> at that time had no School in it all, nor in any many years before.

               <p n="33">33. But <hi>John Fox</hi> goeth further, and telleth us out of his fingers ends,<note place="margin">Fox ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>That the Cardinals</hi> (forſooth) <hi>met ſolemnly after the death of</hi> Leo <hi>IV. ſaid their Maſs of the Holy Ghoſt, and ſo proceeded to their ordinary Election, and brought forth</hi> Gilberta, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But this is all ſcoffing Foolery, for that Cardinals had not the Election of Popes at that time:<note place="margin">Ancient cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection in chuſing Popes.</note> And he that will read the foreſaid <hi>Anaſtaſius Bibliothecarius</hi> (that was preſent at the Election of Pope <hi>Benedictus,</hi> and deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth the particulars thereof) ſhall ſee another manner of Election in uſe at that day by the whole Clergy. Moreover he ſhall ſee that the Cuſtom was not to chooſe at that time any but ſuch as were known and try'd men, and ſuch as had lived for the moſt part of their Life in <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, and had given great ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in their Manners, and behav'd themſelves well in other inferior Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Charges laid upon them.</p>
               <p n="34">34. All which being ſo, let any man of reaſon tell me, how it is poſſible to imagine that men of thoſe times were ſo fond and abſurd, as to chooſe to ſo high a Dignity among them an unknown Man or Woman, whoſe Parents and Country were not known, nor proof had of their Converſation, and much more that they would chooſe ſuch a perſon as this is reported to be, having wandred the World up and down with a Monk, as <hi>Fox</hi> affirmeth? How could all this lie hidden? Was there none that either by Countenance, Voice, or other Actions of hers, could ſuſpect this Fraud? How happened her own Lovers had not diſcover'd her, or her Incontinent Life? How could ſhe paſs through Prieſthood and other Eccleſiaſtical Orders? How by ſo many under Offices and Degrees, as they muſt before they come to be Popes, without deſcrying?</p>
               <p n="35">35. And finally (not to ſtand upon more Improbabilities) either this Pope <hi>Joan</hi> was young, or old, when ſhe was choſen. If ſhe were young, that was againſt the Cuſtom, to chooſe young Popes, as may appear by the great number of Popes that lived in that Dignity above the number of Emperours, that ſucceeded often in their Youth; beſides, it is a moſt unlikely thing that the whole <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy would chooſe a Pope without a Beard, eſpecially a Stranger. But if ſhe were old when ſhe was choſen, then how did ſhe bear a Child publicly in Proceſſion, as our Heretics affirm? How did they not diſcern her to be a Woman or an Eunuch, ſeeing ſhe had no Beard in her Old Age.</p>
               <p n="36">
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:104638:80"/>36. Again, how could ſhe be nine months with Child in that place, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being diſcovered or ſuſpected by ſome? How durſt ſhe go forth in public Proceſſion, when ſhe knew her ſelf to be ſo near her time? How is ſhe ſaid to have gone from the Palace of St. <hi>Peter</hi> to St. <hi>John Lateran,</hi> whereas the Popes lay not then in the <hi>Vatican</hi> at St. <hi>Peters,</hi> but at St. <hi>John Lateran</hi> it ſelf? Finally, there are ſo many fond Improbabilities and moral Impoſſibilities in this Tale, (eſpecially being joyned with the grave Teſtimonies of ſo many ancient Authors and Hiſtoriographers as before we have recited to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary) as no man of any mean judgment, diſcretion, or common ſenſe, will give credit thereto, but will eaſily ſee the vanity of ſo ridiculous a Fiction: Wherefore this ſhall ſuffice for the Confutation of this Heretical Fable, tho' (as before hath been ſhewed) if it were or had been true, yet no prejudice could come to Us thereby, that hold, No Woman, good or bad, can be Head of our Church.</p>

Reader is this? He ſhould have proved that they had married after they had been Prieſts or Monks, and then had he ſaid ſomewhat: But this he could not do, and ſo thought beſt to make a fond flouriſh of the other.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Nay, in the very <hi>Greek</hi> Church at this day, where Prieſts are permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that were married before, tho' their Wives be living, yet if their ſaid Wives die, they are not permitted to marry again.

Wherefore ſending forth his men to ſeek ſome Fiſh by night, (for that they durſt not ſhew themſelves by day) the King and his Mother with woful hearts repoſed a little their weary Bodies and Minds in the ſaid Swineherd's Houſe; and being entred into a little ſlumber, <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith the Story) <hi>there appeared to the King St.</hi> Cuthbert, <hi>telling him both his Name, and that he was ſent to him by God to comfort him, and to tell him, That albeit his Juſtice had hitherto chaſtened</hi> Engliſh-<hi>men for their ſins by the Sword of the</hi> Danes, <hi>yet that he would not extinguiſh them, in reſpect of ſo many Saints that had been of that Nation; and from this day forward would ſet them up again;</hi> Modo tandem Deus indigenarum,<note place="margin">Malm. ibid.</note> Sanctorum meritis ſuper eam mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſericordiae oculo reſpicit. <hi>Now at length God, for the Merits of</hi> Engliſh <hi>Saints, doth look upon</hi> England <hi>with the eye of mercy.</hi> He told him further, <hi>That himſelf from this ſtate of extreme miſery ſhould be reſtored very ſhortly to a flouriſhing ſtate of his Kingdom:</hi> For which he gave him preſently a ſign or token, ſaying, <hi>That albeit that night was a very contrary time to Fiſhers, both for that all Rivers were frozen, and a little Rain being fallen upon the ſame, had made it unfit for men to travel in that Art; yet his men ſhould come home all laden with incredible abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Fiſh.</hi> Thus he told him, perſuading him, that when he ſhould ſee all theſe things performed, he ſhould remember to be thankful to God and his Servants for their favor towards him, and ſo departed.</p>

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:104638:84"/>
and the other two <hi>leſſer Ladders</hi> ſignified by the Brewer's and Shoemaker's Wives; yet at length were they all three made <hi>equal</hi> by the Glory of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom.</p>
               <p n="28">28. Thus reaſoneth <hi>Fox.</hi> And then coming to ſpeak of the ſame two Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men apart, he ſheweth, that <hi>Agnes Potten,</hi> the Brewer's Wife, had Viſions alſo:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Fox p.</hi> 1398.</note> Potten<hi>'s Wife</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in a night a little before her death, being aſleep in her bed, ſaw a bright burning fire right up as a Pole.</hi> By which Viſion he ſheweth, that the Shoemaker's Wife, who was fearful to die, and would have drawn back, <hi>was encouraged by the other alſo to go to the fire.</hi> And do you not ſee here the Spirit of the <hi>Circumcellians</hi> and <hi>Maſſilians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ridiculous Dreams &amp; Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions allowed by <hi>John Fox</hi> in his Martyrs.</note> to run wilfully to death? From this, <hi>Fox</hi> paſſeth to recount another ſtrange prophetical Dream of one <hi>William Hunter,</hi> an Apprentice of <hi>London</hi> Nineteen years old, who would needs be burned alſo, and nothing could keep him from it; much encouraged, as it ſeemeth, by his Dream.</p>
               <p n="29">29. And from this again he runneth to other more ſolemn Dreams and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of <hi>John Rough,</hi> a <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Miniſter, Director of a certain ſecret Proteſtant Congregation in <hi>London</hi> in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> days; and of one <hi>Cuthbert Sympſon,</hi> the Deacon or Clerk of that Congregation; which two had Dreams and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, the one concerning the other of them. Which <hi>Fox</hi> thinketh worthy of ſo great conſideration, as he writeth thus in his Margin: <hi>The Viſions ſent to God's Saints concerning their afflictions.</hi> Now then touching the firſt, St. <hi>Rough,</hi> you muſt know, that he had been a Dominican Friar in <hi>Scotland,</hi> (as <hi>Fox</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth) and from thence running away into <hi>England</hi> gate himſelf a Mate, or (as he calleth her) a <hi>Kate;</hi> with whom lying in bed, he had a Viſion of his Fellow <hi>Sympſon,</hi>

Whereupon being ſore troubled, he awaked, and called to his Wife,</hi> Kate, ſtrike light, for I am much troubled with my Brother <hi>Cuthbert</hi> this night. <hi>And when ſhe had ſo done, he gave himſelf to read on his Book a while; and then feeling ſleep to come upon him, he put out the Candle, and ſo gave himſelf to reſt again; and being aſleep, he dreamed the like Dream; and awaking therewith, he ſaid, O, Kate!</hi> my Brother <hi>Cuthbert</hi> is gone. <hi>So they lighted a Candle again, and roſe.</hi> This is the Viſion of the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Friar, which cauſed his <hi>Kate</hi> twice to ſtrike fire and light the Candle, as you ſee.</p>
               <p n="30">30. The other Viſion of his Clerk <hi>Simpſon</hi> (that kept the Beadroll of the Names of his ſecret Congregation, and was afterward burned with him in <hi>Smithfield</hi>) <hi>Fox</hi> deſcribeth in this manner: <hi>Before</hi> Simpſon<hi>'s burning</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>being in the Biſhop's Cole-houſe in the Stocks, he had a very ſtrange Viſion or Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition, which he himſelf with his own mouth declared to the Godly Learned Man Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> Auſten, <hi>and to his own Wife,</hi> &amp;c. Thus beginneth <hi>Fox</hi> to relate the Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; noting firſt (as you ſee) that he ſpoke it with his own mouth, as tho' it were a great matter. And then he entreth to make a long Apology againſt the Papiſts in defence of theſe Viſions, tho' theirs be not to be believed.</p>

                     <hi>Fox p.</hi> 1844.</note>31. <hi>They will ask me</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>why ſhould I more require theſe to be credited of them, than theirs of us?</hi> This is the demand which he frameth in behalf of the Papiſts; and I think no man will ſay but that it is reaſonable. Let us hear his Anſwer: <hi>Firſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I write not this, binding any man preciſely to believe the ſame, as they do theirs.</hi> Lo here is a Foolery with a manifeſt Lye; the Foolery is in telling us ſo preciſe believing all Viſions and Dreams, which no wiſe man ever thought or ſpake; the Lye is in that he affirmeth us to teach that ſuch preciſe belief is neceſſary in Viſions among us. But let us hear him further in his Anſwer to the former demand:<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>It is no Argument</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:104638:84"/>
reaſon thus: Viſions be not true in ſome; Ergo, they be true in none.</hi> This part we grant; but what is this to his purpoſe or proof? His meaning is, that Ours be not true Viſions, and His be. But who ſhall be Judges? He and His would be. But this is no reaſon; and we on the contrary do ſay much more equally,<note place="margin">How far Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholics give credit to Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and how they examin the ſame.</note> 
                  <hi>Nec mihi, nec tibi;</hi> neither He, nor We, as particular men, ought to judge of theſe things; but the Catholic Church, which by her Biſhops and Paſtors does examin the Proofs, Weight and Moment of every one of theſe things that fall out, and according to the Quality, Merit and Condition of them to whom they happen, as alſo of the Witneſſes and Teſtimonies whereby they are proved, ſhe doth judge of the Truth or Probability of every thing: And to Her therefore we ſtand, and not to the fantaſtical broken Brains of <hi>John Fox,</hi> that maketh Miracles and Viſions where he liſteth, and authorizeth or diſcrediteth them, when it pleaſeth him again.</p>

               <p n="33">33. Finally, to end this Chapter, and therewith this fourth ſtation or Time, <hi>John Fox,</hi> after much trifling here and there, ſetteth down in the laſt words of this his third Book a very brief Catalogue of the Archbiſhops of <hi>Canterbury</hi> of theſe Ages, with this Title:<note place="margin">The Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi> of this time ſcoffed at by <hi>Fox.</hi>

                  </note> among other Miracles happened unto him, one was, that his Harp (wherewith he was wont in his Youth to praiſe God, after the imitation of King <hi>David,</hi>) hanging up by his Bed-ſide on a Pin upon the Wall, he heard one night a voice of Angels ſing in his Church this Verſe; <hi>Gaudent in Coelis animae Sanctorum:</hi> at which time his ſaid Harp alſo gave a ſound of it ſelf, moved either by the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:104638:85"/>
ſaid Angels, or otherwiſe by Miracle from God. Whereat <hi>John Fox</hi> in his He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical Vein maketh much Paſtime, tho' (as already you have heard, and ſhall do more in the third Part of this Book) he eſteemeth highly certain deviſed Miracles of his miſerable Martyrs. And ſo much of this.</p>
               <p n="34">34. But now, as touching the principal Point of all this Diſcourſe, (which ought to have been the viſible deduction of his Church from King <hi>Egbert</hi> to <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror) there is not one word ſpoken; for all that he writeth is of our Church, and this in Lyes, Fables, Scoffs, and Taunts, (as you ſee) but of his own Church nothing, no not ſo much as of any one perſon, that in all agreed with him or his Church in theſe days concerning Religion. Nay, let him ſhew us any one Man, Woman, or Child, Heretic or Catholic, in all this time, who was fully of the Religion now held in <hi>England;</hi> and that theſe believed no more nor leſs than <hi>Fox</hi> and his Fellows do at this day, and we will yield that he hath brought us forth ſome viſible Church and Succeſſion thereof, tho' it be but of three or four perſons.</p>
               <p n="35">35. Lo with how little we are content! And ſeeing <hi>Fox</hi> will not dare, nor any man for him (in my opinion) to take upon him this Enterprize, to wit, to ſhew the ſucceſſion of any three or four perſons throughout the ſpace of this firſt 1000 years after Chriſt, who did in all things believe and profeſs the Faith and Religion that now is held in <hi>England,</hi> (whereunto alſo <hi>John Fox</hi> himſelf agreed fully while he lived, as may appear by the Puritanical Points in his Story, which he commendeth and defendeth in the Lives of <hi>Rogers, Hooper,</hi> and other their firſt <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parents, as after ſhall be ſhewed:) For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch (I ſay) as this is ſo, and that never any three perſons, of what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,<note place="margin">Heretics ſeek to pull down, and not to build up.</note> Religion, Sex or Sect ſoever, can be ſhewed to have agreed fully in the Proteſtants Religion that now in <hi>England</hi> is profeſſed, not only for the time of theſe firſt thouſand years of Chriſtianity, but neither for the other five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred next following;<note n="*" place="margin">Part. <hi>3.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>The fifth ſtation of Time, containing other Three hundred years from <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour unto the time of <hi>John Wickliff;</hi> wherein is examined, Whether the Catholic <hi>Roman</hi> Church did periſh in this time, as <hi>Fox</hi> affirmeth? Here is treated alſo of Pope <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> and of the Marriage of Prieſts.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>YOU have ſeen, good Reader, by our former Treatſe,<note place="margin">The fifth ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from <hi>an. Dom.</hi> 1066, to 1370.</note> how brief and barren <hi>John Fox</hi> hath been hitherto in relating unto us Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal matters for more than a thouſand years: For tho' he promiſed in the firſt Title of his Book, (as before you have heard) that he would ſet forth at large <hi>the whole race and courſe of the Church from the primitive Age unto theſe latter Times of ours,</hi> &amp;c. And again in another Title,<note place="margin">Fox in his Title.</note>
                  <note place="margin">Fox p. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> that he was to lay before us <hi>the Acts and Monuments of Chriſtian Martyrs, and matters Eccleſiaſtical paſſed in the Church of Chriſt, from the primitive beginning to theſe our days, as well in other Countries as namely in the Realms of</hi> England, <hi>and alſo of</hi> Scotland, <hi>diſcourſed at large,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The brevity &amp; barrenneſs of <hi>John Fox</hi> in preforming his promiſe.</note> &amp;c. yet this large Diſcourſe for more than a thouſand years is concluded by him in leſs than ſeventy Leaves of Paper, whereof almoſt fifty are of impertinent matter, to wit, of certain Differences which he would pick out between the <hi>old Roman Church</hi> and <hi>that</hi> which is <hi>now;</hi> and in the relation of the firſt Ten Perſecutions under Heathen Emperours, which before we have declared how little they appertain to his Argument or Subject taken in hand, which was to ſet down <hi>the race and courſe of the whole Church.</hi> And this being ſo, you may conſider what ſtore of Eccleſiaſtical matters he findeth to his purpoſe in theſe firſt thouſand years, ſeeing he ſcarce ſpendeth thirty whole Leaves therein, whereof alſo the far greater part (I mean of that he writeth in theſe few Leaves) is meer temporal or impertinent, as in part you have heard. And how then doth he tell us of <hi>Eccleſiaſtical matters diſcourſed at large,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and of the whole race and courſe of the Church ſet forth largely by him,</hi> &amp;c. Do you ſee how theſe men do face, and lye to deceive their Readers?</p>
               <p n="2">2. But let us not complain (I pray you) of brevity or barrenneſs in <hi>John Fox,</hi> nor lack of Volume, ſeeing he hath ſet forth the greateſt, perhaps, that ever was in our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue: And if he have been over-ſhort for the thouſand years paſt, unto the time of <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror, he will as much exceed in length now for the other five hundred years that are to enſue from the Conqueror to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> upon which time he beſtoweth above 900 Leaves. And the reaſon of this ſo notable difference or inequality is that which we have touched before, to wit,<note place="margin">Why <hi>Fox</hi> writeth ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Ages, &amp; ſo largely of the ſequent.</note> that he finding the whole courſe of theſe former Times and Ages of the Chriſtian Church to be againſt him, nor daring openly to reject that Church, nor manifeſtly to joyn with her Enemies adjudg'd by her for Heretics; he choſe to ſpeak as little of thoſe Times and Affairs as he could. But now he hath taken another reſolution much more deſperate in hand; which is, to deny Our Church to be any longer a Church, and to ſet up another of His in her place, by which means he will come to have mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enough; for that this being ſuppoſed, and he preſuming that all the Acts and Monuments of this Church (I mean the General <hi>Roman</hi> Church) receiv'd hitherto throughout the World for Chriſt's Church, are wicked and rebellious unto God, and Acts of the Devil's Synagogue, from the time that <hi>John Fox</hi> aſſigneth of her Fall and Apoſtacy; and that on the contrary ſide, all the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, Actions, and Geſts of all ſorts of Heretics againſt this Church from that
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:104638:86"/>
time,<note place="margin">How <hi>Fox</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe his lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Books.</note> are the Acts and Monuments of the true Church of Chriſt: Suppoſing all this, I ſay, (as <hi>Fox</hi> doth) there cannot want matter, either on the one ſide or the other, to fill up Volumes: And the lower he paſſeth downward, the more matter he findeth, for that Sects and Sectaries increaſing daily, (whom he regiſtreth for Saints and Pillars of his Church) the Volume of his Book muſt needs grow greatly. And ſo is it ſeen by this fourth Book, wherein from the Conqueſt to the latter-end of King <hi>Edward</hi> III's Reign, when <hi>Wickliff</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, (containing 300 years, to wit, from <hi>Anno Domini</hi> 1066, to 1370,) there are ſpent above 100 Leaves of Paper; which is much more than was in the former 1066 years. But in the fifth Book from <hi>John Wickliff</hi>'s time to King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. (which are but 140 years) are contained upon the point of 200 Leaves; and then again from the beginning of King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Reign to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> (being but fifty years) he ſpendeth above 600 Leaves. And by this you may judge both of the Subject and Subſtance of <hi>John Fox</hi>'s huge Volume, tho' we are to look into the ſame ſomewhat more particularly alſo as we paſs it over in this and the enſuing Chapters.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Well then, this being his device and reſolution for the preſent, to have no longer patience with our Church, but wholly to deny the ſame, his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt difficulty ſeemeth to be about the Time and Cauſes; to wit, <hi>where,</hi> or <hi>when,</hi> or <hi>how,</hi> or <hi>upon what occaſion,</hi> ſhe periſhed or vaniſhed away; for ſeeing ſhe hath continued by his Confeſſion alſo for ſo many Years and Ages, and come down unto our days, under the ſelf-ſame Succeſſion of Biſhops, Paſtors and Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers as before, and conſequently alſo with the ſelf-ſame Doctrin and Religion, and with the ſame external Power and Majeſty which it was wont: it ſeemeth a very hard thing upon the ſudden either to annihilate ſo Great and Mighty a Kingdom,<note place="margin">An impoſſible device to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilate this univerſal vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church.</note> or (which is much more difficult) to make ſo ſtrange a Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoſis and Mutation in her, as that ſhe having been hitherto the Church of Chriſt, his Spouſe, his Kingdom, his deareſt Beloved, and beautified with his Graces, directed by his Spirit, enriched with his moſt precious Gifts and Endowments, and ſo acknowledged alſo by <hi>Fox'</hi> himſelf in former Ages; that now ſhe ſhould become Chriſt's Enemy and Adverſary upon the ſudden, and the Kingdom of Satan, his Eternal Foe, and yet to retain ſtill the Name, Place, Eſtimation, and external Dignity which ſhe had before, profeſſing with no leſs ſhew of duty her Obedience and Love to Chriſt, than in former times ſhe was wont.<note place="margin">A ſtrange &amp; incredible mutation.</note> This Change and Metamorphoſis (I ſay) is moſt wonderful, and incredible to all thoſe that believe Chriſt to be God, and to have been able to perform his promiſe, <hi>that Hell-gates ſhould never prevail againſt this Church.</hi> Wherefore we are to examin ſomewhat more diligently in this Chapter, how this matter could fall out, and when, and by what occaſion come to paſs; for that ſo great and rare a Mutation as this is never fell out yet in the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Tho' Temporal States and Kingdoms have had their changes; nay, all temporal mutations of Empires, Kingdoms, States and Monarchies, have been made principally to ſhew the contrary ſtability and immutable continuation of Chriſt's Church once planted in the World, as in part we have declared <note n="*" place="margin">Sup. cap.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſhewing how that in all times and ſeaſons, in all variety and variations of States, People, Countries, and Dominions, (as well in <hi>England</hi> as elſewhere) the Chriſtian Catholic Religion remained one and the ſame among them all. To which effect alſo is that notable Propheſie of <hi>Daniel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.44.</note> when (foretelling firſt the breaking and overthrow of all four Monarchies by him mentioned) he addeth, as a notorious oppoſition to the ſame, the ſtability and immortality of Chriſt's Church and Kingdom once ſet on foot in theſe words:<note place="margin">The Propheſie of <hi>Daniel</hi> about the ſtability of Chriſt's Church.</note> 
                  <hi>In the days of theſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms God of Heaven ſhall raiſe up a Kingdom that ſhall never be diſſipated, neither ſhall this Kingdom be given to another people: This Kingdom ſhall conſume and wear out all the other Kingdoms, but it ſelf ſhall ſtand for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:104638:86"/>4. Thus ſaith <hi>Daniel;</hi> and the moſt of theſe Points we have ſeen verified and fulfilled already; for God of Heaven hath raiſed this Kingdom and viſible Church of Chriſt, which then ſeemed a ſtrange matter; he hath increaſed and continued the ſame for a thouſand years and more, as <hi>Fox</hi> will confeſs, (which is a longer time than any Temporal Monarchy lightly hath continued without change;) he hath overthrown in this time and conſumed the other Kingdoms and Monarchies mentioned by him, Now remain the other two Clauſes to be fulfilled in like manner, to wit, <hi>That it ſhall ſtand for ever,</hi> (or, as Chriſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth it, <hi>uſque and conſummationem ſaeculi,</hi> to to the Worlds end;) and then, <hi>quod alteri populo non tradetur;</hi> that this Kingdom ſhall not be delivered over to another People from that which poſſeſſed it from the beginning. The quite contrary whereof teacheth here <hi>John Fox,</hi> affirming this Church (that hath been accounted the true Church and Kingdom of Chriſt for a thouſand years paſt) is now no more his Church or Kingdom; nor theſe Popes, Biſhops and Paſtors (that are found in her to have come down by continual Succeſſion) are now no more the true and lawful Guides or Governors thereof; but that it appertaineth to others: and conſequently this Kingdom of Chriſt is taken from them, and delivered to another People, to wit, to the <hi>Berengarians,</hi> to the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> to the <hi>Albanenſes,</hi> to the <hi>Wickliffians, Lutherans, Zuinglians,</hi> and other like people of latter Ages.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This is <hi>John Fox</hi> his mad Aſſertion, wherein you ſee he ſhould prove two Points: Firſt, That our Church, is loſt and fallen, and our Men rightly diſpoſſeſſed of the Intereſt thereof: And then, That his Men (to wit, theſe new Sectaries) have entred into a juſt poſſeſſion of that Name and Title of <hi>the true Church:</hi> Both which Points we deny. You ſhall ſee how he beginneth to prove the firſt; that is to ſay, the Fall and Overthrow of the Univerſal vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church, ſirnamed the <hi>Roman.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And thus hitherto</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſtood the condition of the Church of Chriſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In his Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </note> (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the next Ages before the Conqueſt) <hi>albeit not without ſome repugnance and difficulty, yet in ſome mean ſtate of the Truth and Verity, till the time of Pope</hi> Hildebrand, <hi>called</hi> Gregory <hi>VII. which was near about the year</hi> 1080. <hi>and of Pope</hi> Innocentius <hi>III. in the year</hi> 1215. <hi>by whom all was turned upſide down, all Order broken, true Doctrin defaced, Chriſtian Faith extinguiſhed,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="6">6.

                  <hi>I read and find</hi> (ſaith <hi>Fox</hi>) <hi>that in a Council held at</hi> Rome <hi>by Pope</hi> Hildebrand <hi>and other Biſhops, they did enact three things:</hi> Firſt,<note place="margin">Fox p. <hi>158.</hi> c. <hi>2</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>That no Prieſt hereafter ſhould marry Wives:</hi> Secondly, <hi>That all ſuch as were married ſhould be divorced.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>That none hereafter ſhould be admitted to the Order of Prieſthood, but ſhould ſwear perpetual Chaſtity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="15">15. Truly it is a ſtrange thing to ſee and conſider the wilful obſtinacy and precipitation of Heretics. <hi>Fox</hi> hath gathered out three Points decreed in this Council; which Council yet he citeth not, nor any Author for it, and ſo with more ſafety he playeth the <hi>Davus.</hi> He leaveth out a fourth Point, which was the principal or rather only Point touching Prieſts Marriage han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled in that Council; to wit, That what Prieſt ſoever ſhould be known to keep a Concubine under pretence of his Wife, or ſhould be known to have bought his Benefice by Simony, and would not repent or amend, they were forbidden to enter the Church and ſay Maſs, and other men were forbidden to hear their Maſs. With which Decree many licentious Prieſts, that would not be reſtrained from their looſe Life, being offended; and many more Lay-men,<note place="margin">A great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Pope <hi>Hildebrand</hi> for his Chriſtian Zeal.</note> that depended on the ſaid Emperour, taking their part, cried out againſt this good Pope, for that he went about to reform theſe two ſcandalous Abuſes, Simony and Fornication, in the worſer ſort of Prieſts. And two notable Calumniations amongſt others they raiſed againſt him: The firſt,<note place="margin">The firſt Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniation.</note> That he did not hold the Maſs to be good or available which was ſaid by a Simoniacal or Adulterous Prieſt; which he never ſaid nor meant, but only that for a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and in deteſtation of thoſe ſins, he would have men to forbear the hearing of ſuch Prieſts Maſſes, ſeeing there wanted not other good Prieſts to ſupply their places and Functions: Neither was he the firſt Pope that made the like Decree for puniſhing of Concubinary Prieſts,<note place="margin">Diſtinct. <hi>32.</hi> c. Praeter § verum &amp;c. nullus.</note> by forbidding other men to hear their Maſſes; for that both Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> II. and <hi>Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi> II. his Predeceſſors made the ſame Decree, as appeareth in their Canons yet extant.</p>

The other Calumniation againſt this Pope was this, which <hi>Fox</hi> and the <hi>Magdeburgians</hi> do here ſet down, That he was <hi>the firſt that began to forbid Marriage of Prieſts in the Weſt-Church,</hi> for ſo are the words of the <hi>Magdebur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians:</hi> And hereupon hath <hi>John Fox</hi> framed out of the Council the three Points before mentioned, as handled and decreed then, (which is falſe) and paſſeth over the fourth with ſilence, wherein the only Controverſie conſiſteth.

               <p>
                  <hi>JOhn Fox</hi> taking upon him in his vein of fancy to diſtinguiſh Times, and to determin when the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> fell ſick and died, when Antichriſt was born, and other like vain imaginations, proving alſo the ſame by certain Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations made unto himſelf as he lay on his Bed upon a <hi>Sunday</hi> in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: he ſetteth down for a ground this diſtinction of Times in the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his Acts and Monuments in theſe words: <hi>Firſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I will treat of the ſuffering time of the Church, which continued from the Apoſtles Age about</hi> 300 <hi>years. Secondly, of the flouriſhing time of the Church, which laſted other</hi> 300 <hi>years. Thirdly, of the declining time of the Church, which comprehendeth alſo other</hi> 300 <hi>years, until the looſing out of Sathan, which was</hi> 1000 <hi>years after the cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the Perſecution. Fourthly followeth the time of Antichriſt, or the looſing of Sathan, or deſolation of the Church,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Lo here <hi>John Fox</hi> maketh a different Account from the former, as tho' the time of Antichriſt, and looſing of Sathan for overthrowing the true Church, had begun much ſooner than under Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> and <hi>Innocentius,</hi> to wit, from the year of Chriſt 900, which was almoſt 200 years before <hi>Gregory</hi> VII. was born. And yet doth he alſo contradict himſelf in this, if you mark him; for that he ſaith this looſing of Sathan was about the thouſandth year after the ceaſing of Perſecution; which ceaſing being counted by <hi>Fox</hi> himſelf from the time of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, (when he ſaith Sathan was bound up for 1000 years) the ending thereof muſt fall, not upon the year of Chriſt 900, as in this his Account, but rather upon the year of Chriſt 1300, at which time he was let forth again, (if we believe <hi>John Fox</hi>) and had power given him, not only to impugn, but to overthrow the Church contrary to that which Chriſt had promiſed, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. <hi>That Hell-gates ſhould not prevail againſt her.</hi>

                     <hi>Fox</hi> divers times contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf about binding and looſing of Sathan.</note> which having recited, he ſaith thus: <hi>By theſe words of the Revelation three ſpecial things are to be noted:</hi> Firſt, <hi>the being abroad of Sathan;</hi> Secondly, <hi>his bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up; and</hi> Thirdly, <hi>the looſing out of him again after a thouſand years conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Thus he hath there. And then a little after he maketh his Account thus: <hi>The binding up of Sathan, after peace given to the Church (counting from the 30th year of Chriſt) was</hi> Anno Domini 294; <hi>which laſted for</hi> 1000 <hi>years, until</hi> Anno 1294, <hi>about which year Pope</hi> Boniface <hi>VIII. was made Pope, and made the ſixth</hi> Decretals, <hi>confirmed the Order of Friars, and privileged them with great freedom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So writeth <hi>Fox,</hi> and confirmeth his Sentence by certain old Verſes written by a Monk (as he ſaith) which affirm that
<q>
                     <pb n="158" facs="tcp:104638:90"/>
                     <l>Cùm fuerint anni completi mille ducenti</l>
                     <l>Et decies ſeni poſt partum Virginis Almae;</l>
                     <l>Tunc Antichriſtus naſcetur Daemone plenus.</l>
                  </q>
That is, <q>When a thouſand two hundred and threeſcore years after the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins Child-birth ſhall be finiſhed, then ſhall Antichriſt be born, repleniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ſpirit of Satan.</q> Which <hi>Fox</hi> will needs have to be meant by the foreſaid <hi>Bonifacius</hi> VIII. as tho' He above others had overthrown the Church, and had been the firſt Antichriſt among Popes: Which if it were true, then can it not fall either upon <hi>Gregory</hi> VII. or <hi>Innocentius</hi> III. no nor upon <hi>Boniface</hi> himſelf named by him; for that he was not made Pope 34 years after this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed Propheſie did appoint Antichriſt to be born, to wit, 1260; ſeeing he was made Pope (as <hi>Fox</hi> alſo confeſſeth) <hi>Anno</hi> 1294.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But the beſt paſtime is to hear what immediately followeth in <hi>Fox,</hi> which are theſe words: <hi>Theſe Verſes</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>were written (as appeareth by the ſaid Author)</hi> Anno Domini 1285. Well, Sir <hi>John!</hi> and what of this? doth not this overthrow all the credit of your Propheſie, ſeeing it ſheweth that theſe Verſes were written 25 years after the day appointed by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie was paſt?</p>
               <p n="6">6. So we ſee, that this man having toiled ſo much to draw all that is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> or Book of <hi>Revelation,</hi> concerning Antichriſt, and the binding and looſing of Sathan, to fall upon the Popes and <hi>Roman</hi> Church; he cannot tell where to lay it, but playeth notoriouſly the Fool, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to himſelf, as by the examination of the three places alleged may appear. For in the firſt he affirmeth Chriſtian Faith to have been extinguiſhed either by Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> VII. (in the year of Chriſt 1080) or by <hi>Innocentius</hi> III. in the year 1215;<note place="margin">In proteſt. p. <hi>9.</hi>
                  </note> and here he will have it to have been under <hi>Bonifacius</hi> VIII. which was almoſt another hundred years after <hi>Innocentius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. In the ſecond place he will have the looſing of Sathan, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alſo the Fall of the Church, to have been almoſt 200 years before <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> VII. (that is to ſay,<note place="margin">Acts &amp; Mon. pag. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> in the year of Chriſt 900) and all the reſt downward, to have been under Antichriſt, which he calleth <hi>the time of Deſolation, and Reign of Sathan over the Church.</hi> And he confirmeth the ſame again in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of another Treatiſe following; where repeating the diviſion of his whole Work, he ſaith, <hi>That his intention is, firſt to declare the ſuffering time of the Church,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Fox p. <hi>27.</hi> c. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>for</hi> 300 <hi>years; ſecondly, the flouriſhing time, for other</hi> 300; <hi>thirdly, the declining time, for other</hi> 300 <hi>years; fourthly, the time of Antichriſt reigning and raging ſince the looſing of Sathan for other</hi> 400 <hi>years; fifthly, the reforming time of Chriſt's Church in theſe latter</hi> 300 <hi>ſince</hi> John Wickliff <hi>begun, and after</hi> Luther, <hi>and other like people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">Thus ſaith <hi>Fox;</hi> wherein he agreeth ſomewhat (as you ſee) with his laſt former Account, that Sathan was let looſe to overthrow the Church, about the year of Chriſt 900; which yet is quite contrary to that which he writeth in his firſt place before alledged, that the foreſaid Church was overthrown by Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> VII. and <hi>Innocentius</hi> III. ſome hundreds of years after that time. But much more contrary it is to that which he writeth laſtly out of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calypſe,</hi> in his fourth place alleged; to wit, <hi>That Sathan was bound up for a thouſand years;</hi> which number of years after the firſt Ten Perſecutions, he ſaith, muſt begin from the year of Chriſt 294; which he endeavoreth (tho' fondly) to prove out of the 13th Chapter of the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> where it is ſaid, <hi>That Power was given by the Dragon to the Beaſt,</hi> (to wit, to Antichriſt) <hi>to ſpeak Blaſphemy,</hi>

                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:104638:90"/>
(according to all ancient Fathers Interpretations) to the Reign of Antichriſt in the end of the World. And it is ſo expounded in other places of this Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation it ſelf, to wit, by theſe words, <hi>a time, times, and half a time;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Apoc. <hi>12.</hi> Apoc. <hi>11.11.</hi>
                  </note> and in another place by 1260 <hi>days;</hi> and then again by 42 <hi>months.</hi> All which num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers being examined, do make up juſt the foreſaid three years and a half, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied and expreſſed in like manner by <hi>Daniel</hi> the Prophet.<note place="margin">Dan. <hi>11.</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. And in this there is no doubt or queſtion among Catholics or ancient Writers, but that Antichriſt (a particular perſon deſigned for that end from the beginning of the World) ſhall appear, and have power given him from the Devil to turmoil and afflict the Church of Chriſt for the ſpace of three years and a half before the day of Judgment. Only the Heretics of our time, to divert theſe Propheſies from the true Antichriſt, and apply them to certain Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> do beat their heads how to deviſe out ſome new Expoſitions of theſe numbers never heard or thought of before: And namely <hi>John Fox,</hi> more fondly than the reſt, will have the number of 42 Months to import 294 years, that is, every Month to ſignifie ſeven years, or (as fantaſtically he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it) <hi>a Sabbath of Years.</hi> For proof whereof, having neither Authority nor any one Example of Scripture, he confirmeth it by a Revelation of his own, as after you ſhall hear.</p>
               <p n="10">10. His device therefore is, That the 1000 years wherein Sathan is ſaid in the <hi>Ayocalypſe</hi> to be ty'd up, muſt begin, as you ſee, after the ſaid 294 years of Heathen Perſecution were ended. So that the looſing out of Sathan againſt the Church again, muſt fall in the year of Chriſt 1294, when <hi>Bonifacius</hi> VIII. was choſen Pope; or, as the Monks Propheſie was, upon the year 1260, when Antichriſt was born. Which is both contrary to that he ſaid before, that he was looſed about the year 900; as alſo that the Popes, <hi>Gregory</hi> VII. and <hi>Innocentius</hi> III. (by Sathan's help, no doubt,) overthrew the Church about the year of Chriſt 1080, or 1215: For if that Sathan was bound, and not looſed until the year of Chriſt 1294, how could he overthrow the Church before?</p>
               <p n="11">11. Wherefore all theſe new Interpretations of the words of the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> are but fantaſtical devices of wrangling Heretics,<note place="margin">

                     </p>
                  </note> ſeeing the ancient Fathers do interpret all theſe things far otherwiſe. And firſt, they put the binding up of Sathan for 1000 years there mentioned, before the other number of 42 Months given to Antichriſt to work his will; and do ſay, that the ſaid looſing of Sathan began from the very Death and Paſſion of Chriſt, when the power of Sathan was bound, according to the ſaying of Chriſt himſelf in St. <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel, drawing near to his Paſſion; <hi>Now the Prince of this World ſhall be caſt forth.</hi> And ſecondly, they do interpret theſe 1000 Years not to ſignifie any certain time, but generally to ſignifie all the whole courſe of time between the death of Chriſt and the coming of Antichriſt, three years and a half before the Day of Judgment, according to the ordinary phraſe of Scripture. As for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, <hi>Quod mandavit Deus in mille generationes;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. <hi>140.</hi>
                  </note> God hath commanded his Precept to be kept for a thouſand Generations, that is to ſay, to the Worlds end, and not for any certain time. And again in <hi>Job,</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="12">12. This then is the ancient Interpretation of holy Doctors, quite contrary to theſe new fancies of <hi>John Fox,</hi> whoſe Expoſitions are both contrary to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, (as in part you have ſeen) and oppoſite to the words and ſenſe of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture it ſelf. For whereas firſt theſe 42 Months (importing by his Account 294 years) were given to Sathan to work his will againſt the Saints of God; the Scripture ſaith, <hi>they were given to the Beaſt</hi> (that is to ſay, to Antichriſt,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Apoc.</hi> 13.4, 5, 6</note>) <hi>by the Dragon,</hi> and not to the Dragon himſelf: And ſecondly, whereas he would needs have the 42 Months to ſignifie 294 years, the Scriptures do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:104638:91"/>
them by 1260 days, which make juſt three years and a half, as hath been ſaid.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Thirdly, <hi>Fox</hi> ſhall never find any place or example in Scripture, where the word <hi>Month</hi> either in Greek or Latin doth ſignifie <hi>ſeven Days, Weeks,</hi> or <hi>Years,</hi> as in <hi>Daniel</hi> the Greek word <hi>Hebdomada</hi> doth and may, by its proper ſignification. And yet is <hi>John Fox</hi> ſo fond and reſolute in his device, as all other proofs and probabilities failing him, he will needs confirm it by a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation from God, which he recounteth in theſe words following:</p>
               <p n="14">
                  <note place="margin">

                     <p>A Revelation imparted to <hi>John Fox.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </note>14. <hi>Becauſe the matter</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>being of no ſmall importance, greatly apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth unto the public utility of the Church, and leſt any ſhould miſdoubt me herein, to follow any private Interpretations of my own; I thought good to communicate to the Reader that which hath been imparted unto me, in the opening of theſe My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Numbers in the foreſaid Book of Revelation contained, by occaſion as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="15">15. <hi>As I was in hand with theſe Hiſtories,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>being vexed and turmoiled in ſpirit about the reckoning of theſe Numbers and Years; it ſo happened upon a</hi> Sunday <hi>in the morning, lying in my Bed, and muſing about theſe Numbers, ſuddenly it was anſwered to my mind, as with a majeſty thus ſaying inwardly within me,</hi> Thou Fool, <hi>count theſe Months by Sabboths, as the Weeks of</hi> Daniel <hi>are counted by Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boths. The Lord I take to witneſs thus it was. Whereupon thus being admoniſhed, I began to reckon the</hi> 42 <hi>Months by Sabboths, firſt of the Months, and that would not ſerve; and then by Sabboths of Years, and then I began to feel ſome probable under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding: Yet not ſatisfied herewith, eftſoons I repaired to certain Merchants of my acquaintance, (of whom one is departed, a true and faithful Servant of the Lord, the other two yet alive, and Witneſſes hereof,) to whom the number of theſe foreſaid Months being propounded, and examined by Sabboths of Years, the whole Sum was found to ſurmount to</hi> 294 <hi>years, containing the full and juſt time of the foreſaid Perſecutions, neither more nor leſs,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="16">16. And thus you have the Revelation made to <hi>John Fox;</hi> which he ſaith that he relateth unto us for that we ſhall not miſdoubt the truth thereof, nor think that he followeth any private Interpretation of his own, but that it came from God immediately. And this is the firſt Dream of <hi>John Fox</hi> in his Bed. And the ſecond ridiculous point is, that he went to three Merchants to confer this Revelation, and that they approved the ſame. The third point is open Folly, where he ſaith that this number of 294 containeth the full and juſt time of the firſt Perſecution of Chriſtians under Pagan Emperours, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more nor leſs; which before hath been confuted, and is evident in it ſelf, ſeeing that from Chriſt to the Victory of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> againſt <hi>Maxentius,</hi> there are aſſigned by <hi>Euſebius</hi> 318 years, and yet did not this Perſecution of Chriſtians ceaſe then neither, but continued under <hi>Licinius</hi> and other Tyrants for divers years after. See then how juſt theſe Numbers fall out, <hi>neither more nor leſs!</hi> All which being conſidered, I find no one thing ſo true or credible in all this Revelation, as thoſe words of the Spirit unto him, ſaying, <hi>Thou Fool,</hi> for that this maketh him a Fool indeed by Revelation. And ſo much of him, and of this whole matter of binding and looſing Sathan, and Reign of Antichriſt: Now let us return to the continuation of our Conference with <hi>John Fox</hi> about his Church.</p>
               <p n="17">
                  <note place="margin">The ſucceſſion of the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Church, as alſo of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> from the year of Chriſt 1066. down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</note>17. The deduction of the Catholic Roman Church from <hi>William</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror downward unto <hi>John Wickliff</hi>'s time, is no leſs eaſie and clear, but rather more, than the former deduction from Chriſt to the Conqueſt; for that the Church was now more ſpread and eſtabliſhed over the World, than in any other former Ages. And to come unto the particulars, there ſate in the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> as High-Biſhops of the Univerſal Church, from Pope <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> II. that ſent a Banner bleſſed unto <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror at his entrance

All which, both Popes and Emperours of the Univerſal Church, as alſo the Kings and Archbiſhops of our Iſland, agree uniformly in Faith and Religion, without any difference at all; and ſo it continued in our Iſland. For albeit towards the end of this time <hi>John Wickliff</hi> with his Followers, and ſome other Sectaries, (eſpecially the <hi>Lollards</hi>) roſe up in our Country, and cauſed many troubles both in <hi>England</hi> and other places; yet neither the State of <hi>England,</hi> nor any of our Princes, (and much leſs any Biſhops or Archbiſhops) ever ſuffered themſelves to be infected therewith.

Why did Chriſt ſend the Holy Ghoſt, but to direct and confirm the ſame, not for one Age or Two, but to the Worlds end? How did Chriſt command men under pain of Damnation to enter into this Church, and abſolutely to hear and obey the ſame, if it were only to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure for certain Ages, and then to periſh? How ſhould <hi>Pagans, Infidels, Jews, Turks, Moors,</hi> or other like people, (if by God's Inſpiration they ſhould have a deſire to be Chriſtians) know what to do, or whither to go, or where to be truly inſtructed, if they came after the time appointed by <hi>Fox,</hi> when the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible <hi>Roman</hi> Church had periſhed; to wit, after the time of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> VII. when <hi>Fox</hi> ſaith, <hi>That Chriſtian Faith was now extinguiſhed in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church above</hi> 500 <hi>years agone?</hi> And yet, on the other ſide, this new Church of <hi>Wickliffians, Huſſites,</hi> and others of that Sect, (which he putteth to be the true Church) was not yet born by two or three hundred years. So as then he muſt needs confeſs, that either there was no Chriſtian Church at all for ſome Ages, or that he muſt place it in ſome other obſcure Heretics and Sectaries of that time named by me before, yet he doth not agree at all in their Articles of Religion.</p>
               <p n="26">26.

                  <p>Of the time from <hi>John Wickliff</hi> unto the beginning of the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. containing about <hi>140</hi> years; And how the <hi>Roman</hi> Church and <hi>John Fox</hi> his Church paſſed in theſe days.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BY that which hath been ſaid before from Age to Age of the apparent and manifeſt Deſcent, Progreſs, and Continuation of the Catholic <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and of her State and Condition, as well in <hi>England</hi> as in other parts of the Chriſtian World, (at the riſing of <hi>John Wickliff</hi> an <hi>Engliſh</hi>-man, about the year of Chriſt 1371,) it is not hard to make the like deduction of the ſame Church from that time unto the year of Chriſt 1560, when her Majeſty that now is had a little before begun her Reign, and eſtabliſhed the form of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:104638:93"/>
that now is held in <hi>England:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The ſtate of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church when <hi>Wickliff</hi> began.</note> For as for the Popes and chief Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Governors of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church in this time, they are publicly known; their Names, Number, and Succeſſion one to another from <hi>Innocentius</hi> VI. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbanus</hi> V. and <hi>Gregory</hi> XI. (who firſt condemned <hi>Wickliff</hi>'s Doctrin) unto Pope <hi>Pius</hi> V. that entred the <hi>Roman</hi> See at the beginning of her Majeſties Reign, being in number about Thirty, and all of one Faith and Religion the one with the other.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Emperours alſo both of the Weſt and Eaſt Empire (ſo long as it laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) are known to have been of the ſelf-ſame Religion,<note place="margin">Emperours of theſe Ages.</note> excepting ſome Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and Schiſmatical Opinions in ſome of the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperours againſt the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> for which it may be thought that God of his Juſtice gave them over at length, together with their Empire, into Infidels hands, about the year of Chriſt 1450; <hi>Conſtantinus,</hi> the Twelfth of that Name, ſirnamed <hi>Paleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logus,</hi> being the laſt of that Race.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The manner alſo of proceeding in Eccleſiaſtical matters by this Church in this time, was like unto the former, to wit, by conſerving and continuing the Faith of their Anceſtors, and precedent times; defending the ſame with like diligence againſt Innovations of Heretics, partly by the Writings of Catholic Learned Men, Doctors and Preachers, which in theſe Ages were; as,<note place="margin">The principal Learned Men of this Age.</note> 
                  <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius Ariminenſis, Laurentius Juſtinianus, Thomas de Kempis, Bartholomeus <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas, Thomas Waldenſis, Joannes Gerſon, Alphonſus Toſtatus, Sanctus Vincentius, Sanctus Antoninus, Sanctus Bernardinus Senenſis, Nicolaus Cuſanus, Jo. Tritemius, Jo. Naucleras, Albertus Pius, Eckius, Empſerus, Clicthoveus,</hi> and many other Learned Catholic Writers: By whoſe diligence the Heretics in theſe Ages were every-where refuted. But eſpecially were they repreſſed by the Authority of Synods and Councils, as well Provincial and National as General alſo; to which effect were their latter General Councils,<note place="margin">General Council of <hi>Florence.</hi> General Council of <hi>Lateran.</hi> Council of <hi>Trent.</hi>
                  </note> the firſt of <hi>Florence</hi> under Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> IV. againſt the Heretics and Schiſmatics of thoſe times, about the year of Chriſt 1432; the ſecond of <hi>Lateran</hi> under <hi>Julius</hi> II. and <hi>Leo</hi> X. about the year of Chriſt 1513; and the third of <hi>Trent,</hi> againſt <hi>Lutherans, Zwing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians, Calviniſts, Anabaptiſts,</hi> and other ſuch freſher Heretics of our days, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Pope <hi>Paulus</hi> IV. <hi>Pius</hi> IV. and <hi>Pius</hi> V. which Council was begun about the year 1445.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And albeit in this time (as in former Ages) there wanted not troubleſom Spirits and new-fangling Heads to impugn and exerciſe this Church, as the <hi>Wickliffians, Huſſites, Pickards, Adamites, Thaborites, Orebites,</hi> and other ſuch Sectaries, going before <hi>Lutherans, Zwinglians, Calviniſts, Anabaptiſts, Trinita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> and other like new Dogmatiſts of our days: yet were they always diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, reſiſted, vanquiſhed, and condemned by the ſame ordinary Proceſs of Eccleſiaſtical Cenſures and Judgment; excommunicated, anathematiz'd,<note place="margin">Condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Heretics.</note> and delivered over to Sathan, by the Authority of this Church, as all other Heretics were in former Ages; and conſequently are like to have the ſelf-ſame final end, howſoever they ruffle or reſiſt for a time.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And this being now the demonſtration of our Catholic Church, moſt clear and evident to all them that have Eyes of Underſtanding to ſee, and Grace to conſider the Truth; let us paſs over to the view of <hi>John Fox</hi>'s Church, which having been hitherto inviſible from Chriſt downward, and only imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary or Mathematical, as you have ſeen, (for that he hath ſcarce named any to have been of that Church:) yet now from this time forward he will begin to exhibit unto us a real viſible Church on his part, that is to ſay, a Succeſſion, or rather Repreſentation of divers Profeſſors of his Religion, or of ſome Points thereof at leaſtwiſe, wherein they differ from the <hi>Roman.</hi> For he doth not think it needful for thoſe of his Church to agree in all Articles, nor doth he bind him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Rule of St. <hi>Auguſtin: Eccleſia univerſaliter perfecta eſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aug. de geneſ. ad litteram c. <hi>1.</hi>

                  <pb n="166" facs="tcp:104638:94"/>
The true Church is univerſally perfect, and doth halt in no one point of Belief. But he thinketh it ſufficient for his men to agree in ſome things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and to have <hi>ſome ſparkles of Truth in it,</hi> as before he <note n="*" place="margin">In his Proteſt. pag. <hi>9.</hi>
                  </note> affirmed; albeit therewithal they ſhould have ſome blemiſhes and errors al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, as a little after we will declare.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Catalogue of theſe Proteſtant Profeſſors, whereof <hi>Fox</hi> would make up his Church, we ſhall handle in the Chapter following: Now we are only to tell you, that from this time of <hi>Wickliff</hi> downwards he meaneth to lay down the viſible Succeſſion of his Church, and to that effect he ſtoreth up all thoſe that held the Articles of the foreſaid <hi>Wickliff</hi> or <hi>Huſſe</hi> for Goſpellers of his Church, whatſoever they held otherwiſe againſt him, or different among themſelves. And if any of them or others were puniſhed for their Opinions by our Church, then doth he regiſter them for Martyrs or Confeſſors of the ſame Church; which yet he never durſt do before this time, albeit there were divers other Sectaries in former Ages that ſymboliz'd with him in divers Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, as hath been ſhewed.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Yea, in this matter we may ſee <hi>John Fox</hi> alſo play the <hi>Fox,</hi> and fetch many windings and turnings to deceive his Reader; for that at the very en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of his prolix and tedious Treatiſe of <hi>John Wickliff,</hi> whom he propoſeth as <hi>a choſen man raiſed up by God for lightening the World, and impugning the Church of</hi> Rome;<note place="margin">A ſtarting-hole of <hi>Fox.</hi>
                  </note> he leaveth to himſelf a ſtarting-hole for all neceſſities, when he ſhall be preſſed; telling us, <hi>That albeit in</hi> John Wickliff<hi>'s Opinions and Aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſome blemiſhes perhaps may be noted; yet ſuch blemiſhes they be, which rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare him to be a man that might err, than which directly did fight againſt Chriſt our Savior,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="8">8.

His errors do prove only, <hi>That he was a man, and might err.</hi> And ſo I ſay alſo of the worſt Heretics, that their errors and blemiſhes in Doctrin do prove that they were men, and erring men; yea, wicked men alſo, in that they obſtinately defended their own errors: And ſo I ſay of <hi>Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liff</hi> in like manner. But mark what followeth; <hi>Rather than that he did fight directly againſt Chriſt:</hi> Which is as much as to ſay, that it importeth not much tho' he impugned Chriſt indirectly, if directly he did not fight againſt him. And may not any Heretics that ever lived be defended in this ſort? No He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retics do openly and directly impugn Chriſt, but rather pretend to honor him above others; bearing ever the Names not only of Chriſtians, but alſo of the beſt, and moſt reformed Chriſtians: and conſequently they never fought directly againſt Chriſt, but indirectly, pretending one thing, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing another.</p>

                  </note> and that (as <hi>Fox</hi> confeſſeth) by ſpecial choſen Judges gathered together; to wit, eight Biſhops, fifteen Religious Learned Men of divers Orders, fourteen Doctors, and ſix Batchelors of Divinity; all which <hi>Fox</hi> doth name and contemn: And yet theſe Articles, tho' in divers points they concur with <hi>Luther, Zwinglius</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Doctrin in theſe days, yet in others they do greatly diſagree; and <hi>Fox</hi> I think will not defend them. As for Example:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:104638:94"/>The fourth Article is, <hi>That if a Biſhop or Prieſt ſhould give Holy Orders, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate the Sacrament of the Altar, or miniſter Baptiſm, whiles he is in mortal ſin, in were nothing available.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. Will <hi>Fox</hi> yield to this Article, think you? For if he do, we may call in doubt whether ever he were well baptiz'd, and conſequently whether he were a Chriſtian; ſeeing it may be doubted whether the Prieſt that baptiz'd him were in mortal ſin or no when he did it.</p>
               <p>And again, the ninth Article is, <hi>That it is againſt Scripture for any Eccleſiaſtical Miniſters to have any temporal poſſeſſions at all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Article if <hi>Fox</hi> will grant, yet his Fellow-Miniſters,<note place="margin">

               <p>The tenth Article is, <hi>That no Prelate ought to excommunicate any perſon, except he know him firſt to be excommunicated by God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fifteenth is, <hi>That ſo long as a man is in deadly ſin, he is neither Biſhop nor Prelate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſixteenth is, <hi>That Temporal Lords may according to their own wills and diſcretion take away the Temporal Goods from any Church men, whenſoever they offend.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſeventeenth is, <hi>That Tythes are meer Alms, and may be detained by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhioners, and beſtowed where they will at their pleaſure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. Theſe were ſome of <hi>Wickliff</hi>'s firſt Articles, condemn'd at <hi>Oxford</hi> about the year of Chriſt 1380; but after he publiſhed many worſe. And I would here know of <hi>John Fox,</hi> Whether He and his Fellow-Miniſters will allow of theſe Articles, or no? And if not, but that they will have them accounted for his <hi>blemiſhes</hi> or <hi>errors</hi> (as <hi>Fox</hi> calleth them) then may we alſo with better rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon account for blemiſhes and errors his other Propoſitions, wherein he agreeth with the Proteſtants againſt Us; as I doubt not but that <hi>John Fox</hi> will account thoſe alſo wherein he agreeth with Us againſt Him, which are many, and far more than the former, wherein he joyneth with Him againſt Us, as may be gathered by theſe few Articles alleged here by <hi>Fox</hi> himſelf; whereby (tho' mingled with much other erroneous Doctrin, as you ſee) it is evident that <hi>Wickliff</hi> held divers Points alſo of Catholic Religion; as, Holy Orders, Conſecration, Excommunication, diſtinction of Venial and Mortal Sins, and other like. For which cauſe I marvel why <hi>John Fox</hi> would allege theſe Articles, but only to confound himſelf, and to ſhew that his holy Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch <hi>Wickliff</hi> is ſo full of blemiſhes, as ſcarce any unſpotted thing can be found in his Doctrin.</p>
               <p n="12">12. But this is the beggery of this new Church,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Fox</hi>'s Church made up of our Dunghil clouts.</note> that it cannot be made up but by ſuch Dunghil-clouts gathered together from under the feet of their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries: For albeit <hi>Wickliff, Huſſe,</hi> and other like Sectaries, did hold many more Articles with Us againſt the Proteſtants, than with Them againſt us; yet ſuch is the Integrity, Purity, Severity, yea Majeſty of our Church, that foraſmuch as they agreed not in all and every point of Belief, we (according to the Creed of <hi>Athanaſius</hi>) reject them and as ſpotted and blemiſhed Rags do caſt them out to the Dunghil, whom poor <hi>Fox</hi> gathereth up again with great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, putting them into his Calendar for Saints, and chief Pillers of his new Church, and ſo conſequently maketh his Church of our Shoe clouts; which how honorable thing it may be eſteemed, let every man judge: For if theſe Heretics did agree with him in all Points of his Doctrin, tho' by joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them he ſhould ſhew himſelf an Heretic; yet they not agreeing but in ſome Points only, and impugning him in the reſt, it ſheweth a marvelous baſe mind, and lack of common ſenſe, to make them Pillars of his Church, as he doth.</p>

                     <hi>Fox</hi>'s facility in rejecting Parliaments.</note> 
                  <hi>preaching unto the People,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Which Preachers, tho' the words of the Statute do term them to be diſſembling perſons, preaching divers Sermons containing Hereſies and notorious Errors, to the emblemiſhment of Chriſtian Faith,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>yet notwithſtanding may every true Chriſtian Reader conceive of thoſe Preachers to have taught no other Doctrin than now they hear their own Preachers in Pulpits preach,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="22">22. Mark here three Points, good Reader. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That if all this were true, that the <hi>Wickliffians</hi> had preached no other Doctrin than the Proteſtants do now; yet nothing followeth of this, but that Proteſtants Doctrin was condemned for Hereſie not only by the Church-Laws, but alſo by divers Acts of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliaments, above 200 years paſt. Which thing, what help or cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit it can bring to <hi>Fox</hi> his Religion, which ſtandeth chiefly in <hi>England</hi> by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of far latter Acts of Parliament, I do not ſee; for that hereof only may be inferred two Concluſions, if his premiſes be true: The firſt, That Proteſtants were condemned for Heretics by Acts of Parliament 200 years agone: The ſecond, If thoſe ancient Acts of Parliament were of little force in matters of Religion; then latter Acts, that have eſtabliſhed a different Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, may alſo be called in queſtion, and that with much more reaſon and probability.</p>
               <p n="23">23. <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſay, That this Aſſertion of <hi>Fox</hi> is moſt apparently falſe, (to wit, that the <hi>Wickliffian</hi> Preachers taught no other Doctrin than the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Preachers now teach) if the Articles before alleged out of himſelf be truly written by him: For neither do the Proteſtant Preachers in <hi>England</hi> at this day teach the <hi>Real Preſence</hi> in the bleſſed Sacrament of the Altar, or the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of Purgatory,</hi> (as you have heard Sir <hi>John Oldcaſtle</hi> a chief <hi>Wickliffian</hi> profeſs a little before) nor yet do Proteſtants hold thoſe Articles of <hi>John Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liff</hi> himſelf, (which in this Chapter we have mentioned) as held neither by Them nor Us. And much leſs do they hold any other Catholic Opinions, which the <hi>Wickliffians</hi> did, together with their Hereſies. So as this is a noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious untruth, and cannot be denied or diſſembled.</p>
               <p n="24">24. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We may conſider of the particular Point which before I no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, That <hi>John Fox</hi> is not aſhamed to cite a whole Parliament againſt himſelf, and then in a word to reject the ſame, as of no credit in the World in reſpect of Him and his Denial or Rejection. <hi>The Parliament</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>calleth theſe Frize gown-Preachers</hi> (the <hi>Wickliffians</hi>) <hi>diſſembling perſons; but you muſt think notwithſtanding they were very honeſt men.</hi> The Parliament ſaith, That they preached Hereſies and notorious Errors; but <hi>John Fox</hi> ſaith it was true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Doctrin. Whom ſhall we here believe, either the whole Parliament, who lived with them, and examined both their Doctrin and doings; or <hi>John Fox,</hi> that cometh more than 200 years after them, and will needs make himſelf their Brother whether they will or no, and judge alſo of the Parliament? But let us hear him yet further.</p>

teaching new Doctrin and heretical Opinions; <hi>Fox</hi> averreth the contrary, <hi>That they were good Preachers, and faithful Defenders of true Doctrin, and holy Witneſſes of God's Truth.</hi> And for proof hereof, he ſaith, <hi>That whoſoever read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Hiſtories, and conferreth the Order and Deſcent of times, ſhall underſtand thus much to be true.</hi> But how and by what means a man ſhall gather this under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, he telleth us not. And by the Hiſtorical Diſcourſes and Conference of times, which we have hitherto made in this Book, we underſtand the contrary; finding indeed by Deſcent and Order of times, that theſe Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Wickliff, Huſſe,</hi> and <hi>Lollards,</hi> and the like, were new heretical Opinions indeed, and taken and judged ſo by <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> at their up riſing and appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in the World. Wherefore this is plain impudence in <hi>Fox,</hi> to ſay that by reading Hiſtories, and noting deſcent of Times, theſe men are by him juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied from being Sectaries.</p>

                  <hi>Of the like number alſo</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of like true faithful favourers and followers of God's holy Word, we find in the year of our Lord</hi> 1422, <hi>ſpecified in a Letter ſent from</hi> Henry Chicheſley <hi>Archbiſhop of</hi> Canterbury <hi>to Pope</hi> Martin <hi>V. of many infected here in</hi> England <hi>(as he ſaid) by the Hereſies of</hi> Wickliff <hi>and</hi> Huſſe, <hi>&amp;c. who tho' they be termed for Heretics and Schiſmatics; yet ſerved they the living Lord, within the Ark of his true ſpiritual and viſible Church. And where is then the frivolous brag of the Papiſts, which make ſo much of their painted Sheaths,</hi> &amp;c?</p>
               <p n="28">28. Do you ſee in what jollity of mind <hi>John Fox</hi> is put, by finding out this Succeſſion of his new viſible Church for above 200 years downward? Do you hear how he vaunteth of Antiquity and long Continuance, albeit indeed he nameth not continuance, nor can he? for that (I think) he will not grant that the <hi>Wickliffian</hi> Church doth endure unto this day,<note place="margin">If <hi>Wickliffian</hi> Preachers were now alive, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants would not admit them.</note> or that if a number of thoſe <hi>Wickliffian</hi> holy Teachers and faithful Witneſſes of the Truth, ſo much praiſed here by him, ſhould come into <hi>England</hi> at this day, or <hi>Scotland,</hi> or into <hi>Germany,</hi> or <hi>Geneva,</hi> or among any other Sect or ſort of Proteſtants whatſoever, and ſhould preach that Doctrin which they preached then, (to wit, againſt the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in many Points, but yet defending that number of Sacraments which they did, the <hi>Real Preſence, Sacrifice of the Maſs,</hi> together with thoſe extravagant Articles alſo before mentioned, to wit, <hi>That it is againſt the Scriptures that Biſhops or true Miniſters ſhould have any Temporal Lands and Livings; and that Tythes are not due; and that both Princes and Prelates do loſe their Offices, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities, and Dignities, whenſoever they fall into mortal ſin,</hi> &amp;c.) If theſe men (I ſay) that were ſo true Preachers and principal Guiders of the Ark of <hi>John Fox</hi> his true viſible and ſpiritual Church in thoſe days, ſhould revive and preach again in theſe days, would his Brethren the Proteſtants, in <hi>England</hi> or out of <hi>England,</hi> receive them, think you? And if it be certain that they would not, how were they true Preachers <hi>then,</hi> and not <hi>now?</hi> or how can <hi>theſe</hi> and <hi>they</hi> be true Brethren of one Faith, Religion, or Church? Doth not every ſimple Man or Woman ſee this Folly and abſurd Contradiction?</p>
               <p n="29">29. But to return to the matter in hand, about rejecting Parliaments and other public Teſtimonies, we ſee that <hi>John Fox</hi> with the ſame facility both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citeth and rejecteth the Letter of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> written to the Pope about thoſe <hi>Wickliffians</hi> of his time, twenty years after the former Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament was held; but yet in conformity of that which the ſaid Parliament under King <hi>Henry</hi> IV. and the other before under King <hi>Richard</hi> II. did teſtifie,<note place="margin">How <hi>Fox</hi> hath found out a viſible Church, and from whence.</note> as well of the ſaid Sectaries Hypocriſie and Diſſimulation, as of their wicked Errors and Hereſies.

                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:104638:97"/>30. And it is to be noted, that ſcarce ever throughout this whole Volume of Acts and Monuments from Chriſt downward (for the ſpace of 1400 years) doth <hi>Fox</hi> talk of any viſible Church on his ſide, but only now, when he cometh to theſe <hi>Wickliffians,</hi> and other like Sectaries: And yet, to ſpeak warily alſo, he adjoyneth unto it the word <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> to have ſome ſtarting-hole to run out when he ſhall be preſſed about the true nature of viſible Succeſſion; which we mean to do in the next Chapter following.

                  <hi>That Papiſts do brag of their pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, Sheath, concerning their Churches Antiquity and Succeſſion; and that he hath ſufficiently proved before by the continual deſcent of his Church after the Doctrin that now is reformed, that it hath ſtood and been continued from the beginning,</hi> (for ſo are his words) yea and that <hi>viſibly,</hi> as now he addeth. Whereat (I know) no man can chooſe but laugh, that hath read this our Treatiſe wherein we have ſhewed all the contrary, to wit, the viſible Deſcent of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church by orderly Succeſſion from the Apoſtles time, and that <hi>John Fox</hi> hath not ſo much as named any different Succeſſion or Deſcent of his Church diſtinct from the other, until the time of <hi>Innocentius</hi> III. 1200 years after Chriſt. And what manner of deduction or collection of Heretics and Sectaries he bringeth down from thence, and how well they agree and hang together, either in Time, Place, Function or Faith, we ſhall examin a little after.</p>
               <p n="31">31. But now, before we end this Chapter, we are to advertiſe the Reader, that beſides the Sects before named of the <hi>Petrobuſians, Henricians, Waldenſians,</hi> or poor men of <hi>Lyons,</hi> the <hi>Albigenſians</hi> and <hi>Wickliffians,</hi> there was another Sect in <hi>England</hi> called <hi>Lollards,</hi> more famous than the reſt in reſpect of <hi>Lollards Tower</hi> ſome what renowned in <hi>London</hi> for the Impriſonments of thoſe Sectaries in that place. But when and how this Sect of Heretics began is not ſo clear; for that ſome (as <hi>Prateolus</hi> and others) ſeem to affirm that it took its Origin in <hi>England</hi> as a Brood of the <hi>Wickliffiſts,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

Wherefore the Abbot <hi>Tritemius,</hi> a <hi>German</hi> Chronicler, declareth the matter more particularly and truly,<note place="margin">Trit. in chron. an. Dom. <hi>1315.</hi>
                  </note> ſaying, <hi>That there was a certain Heretic in</hi> Germany <hi>called</hi> Gualter Lolhard, <hi>who about the year of Chriſt</hi> 1315, <hi>taking cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Doctrin from the</hi> Albigenſes <hi>and</hi> Waldenſes <hi>that went before him, and adding (as the faſhion is of Sectaries) divers new Opinions of his own, made a particular Sect, who were called</hi> Lolhards.

               <p n="32">32.

                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:104638:97"/>33. And albeit theſe two Sects, beginning (as you have heard) the one in <hi>Germany,</hi> and the other in <hi>England,</hi> with the diſtance of ſome fifty years of their Off-ſpring, had many Opinions common to them both, (eſpecially againſt the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, againſt Invocation of Saints, Faſtings, Prayers, and the Sacraments of Penance, Matrimony, Extreme Unction, and the like;) yet had they their peculiar Opinions alſo, whereby they were made a ſeveral Sect. As for Example, the <hi>Lolhards</hi> impugned not only the foreſaid three Sacraments of Penance, Matrimony, and Extreme Unction, (as ſome <hi>Wickliffians</hi> did,<note place="margin">The peculiar Opinions of the <hi>Lollards.

                  </note>) but Baptiſm and the Euchariſt in like manner.

That our Lady could not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> bear Chriſt and remain a Virgin, for that ſo he ſhould have been an Angel, and not a Man.

And of this he relateth a certain Story happened in <hi>Germany,</hi> which was, That one <hi>Giſla</hi> (a young wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of their Sect) coming to be burned for Hereſie, ſhe was asked whether ſhe were a Virgin or no; whereunto ſhe anſwered, That above-ground ſhe was, but under-ground not.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Melanct. epiſt. ad Freder. Mechonium.</note> that ſaith of him, <hi>Nec intellexit nec tenuit Fidei Juſtitiam;</hi> He neither underſtood nor

held the Juſtice of Faith, which is the very Foundation of <hi>Luther</hi>'s Goſpel and Doctrin.</p>
               <p n="36">36. And again in the ſame place he objecteth divers other erroneous Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrins unto him: as, <hi>That he doth take away all Civil and Politic Government; that he holdeth for unlawful to Prieſts to poſſeſs any thing proper; that no Tythes are to be paid,</hi> and the like. Which Doctrins of <hi>Wickliff</hi> notwithſtanding our <hi>John Fox</hi> defendeth, commending highly the Teachers and Profeſſors thereof, in all his tract of Time from King <hi>Edward</hi> III. to King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. canonizing them for Saints that were any way puniſhed or called in queſtion for any of theſe Doctrins, under the Reigns of King <hi>Richard</hi> II. or King <hi>Henry</hi> IV, V, VI, or VII. and other Kings of that time. And in this Argument is ſpent the whole ſum of his fifth and ſixth Books, in which Books the very Titles of the Pages may ſufficiently teſtifie what is handled therein.<note place="margin">Anno Dom. <hi>1382.</hi>
                  </note> As for Example, <hi>page</hi> 406. under the Reign of King <hi>Richard</hi> II. is this Title, <hi>The firſt Law for burning the Profeſſors of the Goſpel</hi> Whereby you ſee that he calleth all theſe men, whether they be <hi>Wickliffians, Huſſites,</hi> or <hi>Lolhards,</hi> Profeſſors of Chriſt's Goſpel, and conſequently muſt he needs hold for Evangelical Truth all which they did hold: and ſo in effect he doth, in handling their Cauſes throughout theſe two Books, againſt the Biſhops and Princes that puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, though in clear words and Categorical Propoſitions he dare not do it.</p>
               <p n="37">37. And this is the ſluttering and ſtammering, turning and winding of this our <hi>Fox,</hi> as you can never know where to have him; for that now he affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, now he denieth; now he leaveth the matter doubtful; now he moveth a queſtion, but ſolveth it not; now he gainſayeth and contradicteth himſelf; now he ſaith one thing in words, and proſecuteth another in deed. As for Example,<note place="margin">How <hi>Fox</hi> beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth himſelf in defending <hi>Wickliffians</hi> &amp; their Doctrin.</note> He confeſſeth before in words, (as you have heard) <hi>That</hi> Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liff <hi>had divers blemiſhes in Doctrin,</hi> (that is to ſay, Errors and Hereſies,) and ſo it may appear, as well by that which we have ſet down thereof, as alſo by the Judgment of <hi>Melancthon;</hi> and yet in proſecution of his Work <hi>John Fox</hi> will not ſtick to commend the worſt of thoſe Doctrins, as we may ſee by the very Titles of the Pages ſet over theſe Books.</p>
               <p n="38">38. As for Example, <hi>page</hi> 420. he putteth this Title over the ſaid Page: <hi>Temporalities may be taken from the Clergy,</hi> &amp;c. And then yet further, in the ſame Page he putteth this Head or beginning to a long Diſcourſe about this matter in theſe words: <hi>The ſecond Diſputation in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity of</hi> Prague, <hi>upon the ſeventeenth Article of</hi> John Wickliff, <hi>moſt fruitful to be read, proving by twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-four Reaſons out of the Scriptures, that Temporal Lords and Princes may take away Temporalities from the Clergy,</hi> &amp;c. This is the Title of this fruitful Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe for taking away all Temporal Fruits from the Clergy. But how fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſoever this Diſputation may ſeem to <hi>John Fox</hi> againſt Clergy-Temporalities, that perhaps could get none for himſelf; yet to others of his Clergy, that poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs Temporalities, I doubt much whether it will ſeem ſo fruitful, or be ſo well liked of as by <hi>John Fox,</hi> who for his twenty-four Reaſons alleged for the ſame, may chance be related into ſome Rank of the twenty-four Orders, fit for a Man of his Degree and Merits.</p>
               <p n="39">39. Moreover, <hi>page</hi> 426. he hath this Title, <hi>Tythes proved to be pure Alms.</hi> Which Title I think alſo will not greatly content the moſt of his Fellow-Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, if their Pariſhioners ſhould ſtand upon this Doctrin with them, to wit, <hi>That their Tythes are pure Alms,</hi> according to the Goſpel of <hi>John Wickliff</hi> and <hi>John Fox;</hi> and conſequently they may deny or detain them when they liſt, or give ſo much thereof unto Miniſters as they liſt, and no more, which often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times perhaps would be very little. But what would theſe Miniſters, think you, (but eſpecially their Wives and Children) ſay of this Doctrin, if once
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:104638:98"/>
they felt hunger come upon them thereby? yet <hi>Fox</hi> proſecuteth the ſame Title over other Pages. As for Example, <hi>page</hi> 446. he hath theſe words:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Fox</hi> alloweth taking away of Tythes and Temporalities from the Clergy.</note> 
                  <hi>Tythes not expreſly commanded anew by Chriſt;</hi> and then hath he this Note: If Tythes be claimed by force of the Old Law, then Prieſts by the ſame Law are bound to have no Temporalities. And this matter <hi>Fox</hi> doth proſecute at large, as one Article among other, of one <hi>Walter Brute,</hi> a Lay-man of the Sect of <hi>Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liff;</hi> in whom, ſaith <hi>Fox, the mighty operation of God's Spirit did effectuate ſuch conſtancy, as in this and other Articles he reſiſted openly the Biſhop of</hi> Hereford <hi>in his time,</hi> &amp;c. Lo here the approbation of <hi>Brute</hi>'s Spirit, whoſe fourth Article was, as <hi>Fox</hi> himſelf ſetteth down, <hi>That no man is bound to give Tythes;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Fox p. <hi>348.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>and if any man will needs give, he may give to whom he will, excluding thereby their Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates.</hi> Another Article alſo was of the ſaid <hi>Brute, That a Prieſt receiving by bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain any thing of Yearly Annuity, is thereby a Schiſmatic, and Excommunicate.</hi> Which if it be true, then are his Miniſters in a hard caſe at this day in <hi>England,</hi> who do bargain for their Service and Wages due thereunto.</p>
               <p n="40">40. And ſo goeth <hi>Fox</hi> on from Point to Point to ratifie <hi>John Wickliff</hi>'s Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, or at leaſt the Profeſſors thereof; not conſidering (ſimple Fellow) how much they differ from him, or make againſt him, ſo they be contrary to the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> or condemned by him. For further proof of which Folly and blind Ignorance, we ſhall paſs now to treat in a ſeveral Chapter what manner of Continuance and Succeſſion of his Church he deviſeth, thro'out the Rabble of theſe oppoſite Sects, from the time of Pope <hi>Innocentius</hi> III. to the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. whereby I doubt not but the Reader will remain ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently inſtructed of theſe Mens madneſs, that of ſo contrary and repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Spirits will needs frame to themſelves the Unity of a true Chriſtian Church.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The moſt abſurd and ridiculous Succeſſion of Sectaries appointed by <hi>John Fox</hi> for the Continuance of his Church from Pope <hi>Innocentius</hi> III. down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; where alſo by this occaſion is declared the true Nature and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of lawful Eccleſiaſtical Succeſſion.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>HAving now followed <hi>John Fox</hi> throughout all this Treatiſe from Chriſt's time to ours, to ſee what viſible courſe and race he would ſet down, as well of His Church as Ours, (according to his promiſe made in the beginning of his Acts and Monuments) we have found him hitherto to have talked only in a manner of Our Church, that is to ſay, of the Univerſal <hi>Roman</hi> Church, perſpicuouſly come down by ſucceſſion of Years and Ages from the Apoſtles to Us; neither did <hi>John Fox</hi> for twelve hundred years together ſo much as name unto us any other Congregation of Men or Women, ſmall or great, good or bad, (that in this time bare the Name of a Chriſtian Church) beſides the other; nor did he pretend any Succeſſion, fearing perhaps thoſe words of <hi>Tertullian</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Supra c. <hi>10.</hi> Tertull. l. de Praeſcript.</note> before recited: <hi>Confingant tale aliquid Haeretici, &amp;c.</hi> 
                  <q>Let Heretics preſume to feign or deviſe any ſuch Succeſſion of Biſhops, Teachers and Paſtors for Their Church as we have alleged for Ours, if they dare.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. But now, from Pope <hi>Innocentius</hi>'s time downwards, <hi>John Fox</hi> preſuming that all the other Church was fallen from God, (a great preſumption indeed, as before hath been ſhewed) he bringeth us forth in place thereof another Company of Men, which he ſaith in thoſe days made the true Church, (for
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:104638:99"/>
that they were condemned by the other Church, which he holdeth for the falſe.) And theſe were a certain Rabblement of Sectaries different in Opinions and Profeſſions not only from Us, but alſo from <hi>John Fox</hi> and his Crew, and moſt of all among themſelves, being of divers Countries, Sects, Times, Ages, Offices and Functions, and cohering together in no other form at all of Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but that one roſe or ſprung up after the other. For which cauſe <hi>Fox</hi> himſelf in his Acts and Monuments doth not handle their Affairs as of any Congregation that ever met together, or ſaw perhaps one another, or had Conference, Order, Subordination or Succeſſion among themſelves, but only tieth them together in a certain Liſt or Catalogue, as <hi>Sampſon</hi>'s Foxes were by the Tails.<note place="margin">Judic. <hi>15.</hi>
                  </note> Which Liſt or Catalogue he ſetteth down in his foreſaid Proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Church of <hi>England:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Fox in Proteſt. ad Eccl. Angl.</note> telling us firſt, <hi>That during the time of the laſt</hi> 400 <hi>years, from Pope</hi> Innocentius <hi>downwards, the true Church of Chriſt durſt not openly appear in the face of the World, being oppreſſed by Tyranny; but yet that it remained from time to time viſibly in certain choſen Members, that not only bare ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret good affection to ſincere Doctrin, but ſtood alſo in the defence of Truth againſt the Church of</hi> Rome.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This is his Aſſertion; which he proveth by a large Liſt or Catalogue (as I have ſaid) of ſundry that were in this time cenſured and condemned in ſome part of Doctrin by the ſaid <hi>Roman</hi> Church.<note place="margin">Fox ib. p. <hi>10.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>In which Catalogue</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>firſt to pretermit</hi> Bertramus <hi>and</hi> Berengarius, <hi>which were before Pope</hi> Innocentius <hi>III. a</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">What Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning they were of you ſhall ſee after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</note> 
                  <hi>Learned multitude of ſufficient Witneſſes here might be produced, whoſe Names neither are obſcure, nor Doctrin unknown, as</hi> Joachim <hi>Abbot of</hi> Calabria, Almari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus <hi>a Learned Biſhop, that was judged an Heretic for holding againſt Images; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Martyrs of</hi> Alſatia, <hi>of whom we read an hundred to be burned by Pope</hi> Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centius <hi>in one day. Add likewiſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to theſe the</hi> Waldenſes <hi>and</hi> Albigenſes, Marſilius Patavinus, Gulielmus de Sancto Amore, Symon Tornacenſis, Arnoldus de nova Villa, Joannes Semica, <hi>beſides divers others Preachers in</hi> Suevia, <hi>ſtanding againſt the Pope,</hi> Anno 1240, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Thus beginneth <hi>Fox</hi> his Catalogue, and then goeth he forward with <hi>Joannes Anglicus</hi> a Maſter of <hi>Paris,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mark what men <hi>Fox</hi> doth couple toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as of one Faith.</note> 
                  <hi>Petrus Joannis</hi> a Minorite, burned after his death; <hi>Robert Groſſehead</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> called <hi>Malleus Romanorum,</hi> &amp;c. And further he addeth <hi>Joannes de Ganduno, Eudo</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelled the French King to receive the Popes Extravagants, <hi>Dantes</hi> an <hi>Italian</hi> Poet, that wrote againſt Popes, Monks and Friars, together with <hi>Petrarcha,</hi> and them <hi>Conradus Hagaz</hi> impriſoned for preaching againſt the Maſs, <hi>Anno</hi> 1339, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And to theſe again he coupleth <hi>Franciſcus de Arcaterra,</hi> and others burned for new Opinions, <hi>Gregorius Ariminenſis, Armachanus, Occham,</hi> and others, as tho' theſe had been all of the ſame Opinions. And finally, he falleth upon the <hi>Lollards, Wickliffians, Huſſites,</hi> and their Followers in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia,</hi> ſucceeding one after another, now in this Country, now in that, now upon one occaſion, and now upon another, until the Reign of King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> III. when <hi>Martin Luther</hi> began his Profeſſion, who did agree and ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolize in divers Points with the ſaid former Sects of <hi>Waldenſes</hi> and <hi>Albigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Lollards, Wickliffians,</hi> and <hi>Huſſites,</hi> and differed in others, as before hath been declared: And after the <hi>Lutherans</hi> did follow again others, partly agreeing, and partly diſagreeing, as <hi>Zuinglius, Calvinus, Beza, Oecolampadius,</hi> and others unto our days, and every one affirming his Opinions to be the New Goſpel.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And this is the viſible Succeſſion (forſooth) which <hi>John Fox</hi> hath deviſed to ſet down for the proof of his new Church, and the Antiquity thereof for 400 years paſt: And it is like as if a man in <hi>England,</hi> to diſgrace the City of <hi>London,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A fit ſimilitude &amp; compariſon.</note> ſhould ſeek out the Records of all thoſe that have been hanged at <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn</hi> for Theft or Murthers for 400 years: and having found them out, ſhould
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:104638:99"/>
produce them for Witneſſes of the truth, and for honeſt men and good Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens; condemning both the Judges and Jurors and whole Country, that gave Sentence and Verdict againſt them. And yet if you will ſee how <hi>John Fox</hi> playeth the Fool indeed, and braggeth of this Succeſſion of his Church, obſerve what he writeth preſently upon the enumeration of theſe foreſaid Pillars of his Church.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Wherefore if any be ſo beguiled in his Opinion</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>as to think that the Doctrin of the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>(as now it ſtandeth) is of ſuch Antiquity, and that the ſame was never impugned before the time of</hi> Luther <hi>and</hi> Zuinglius <hi>now of late; let him read theſe Hiſtories, and peruſe the Acts of Parliament paſſed in this Realm of ancient time; as,</hi> Anno 5 Regis Richardi 2. 1380, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Fond reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Fox.</hi>
                  </note> Did you ever hear a man in his Wits reaſon in this ſort? How doth this Catalogue (I pray you) of condemned Heretics (for theſe laſt 400 years) impugn the Antiquity of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church or Doctrin before that time? And again, Who doth deny but that the ſame <hi>Roman</hi> Church and Doctrin was impugned by old Heretics long before <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Zuinglius;</hi> yea, and before <hi>Wickliff, Waldenſes, Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genſes,</hi> and <hi>Berengarius</hi> were born, as by our former deduction hath appeared that ſhe was impugned by Heretics of every Age? And moreover, To what purpoſe doth <hi>Fox</hi> will us to read theſe Hiſtories, and the Acts of Parliament paſſed againſt <hi>Wickliffians</hi> in the time of King <hi>Richard</hi> II? To what purpoſe (I ſay) doth this ſimple Fellow talk and write this againſt himſelf, ſeeing that by theſe Hiſtories and Statutes we learn nothing (as before we have noted) but only that his elder Brethren the <hi>Lollards</hi> and <hi>Wickliffians</hi> were condemned for Heretics by public Authority of our Realm above 200 years agone? Which we grant unto him without further proof?</p>
               <p n="7">7. Wherefore, to leave this childiſh babling, that is without ſenſe, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, or reaſon, and to return to ſome more ſerious Argument: We ſhall handle here two Points for better diſcuſſion of this Succeſſion of Sectaries alleged by <hi>John Fox.</hi> Firſt, What are the Conditions neceſſarily required to a good Eccleſiaſtical Succeſſion, for demonſtrating a Church: And then,<note place="margin">Two Points to be handled in this Chapter.</note> What manner of men theſe were indeed, which <hi>Fox</hi> doth here aſſign for Repreſentation of his Church. And all ſhall be done with as much brevity as may be.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The firſt Condition is, That this Succeſſion of men that make the Church be Univerſal both in Place and Time; that is to ſay,<note place="margin">
                     <p>The conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Eccleſ. Succeſſion.</p>

                  </note> (to uſe St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi>'s words) <hi>Non quae hoc loco eſt, ſed quae hoc loco, &amp; per totum Orbem terrarum; nec illa quae hoc tempore, ſed ab ipſo</hi> Abel, <hi>uſque in finem, &amp;c.</hi> 
                  <q>That it be not in this or that particular place only, but in this place, and throughout the whole World; and that it be not only in this or that time, but that it be from <hi>Abel</hi> to the end of the World.</q> By which words of St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> we ſee that the viſible Succeſſion of the true Church muſt be Univerſal, firſt in Place, and that it muſt be a viſible Company profeſſing Chriſt under one Faith and Doctrin, not in this or that particular Country, Province or Place only, but over all the World, where Chriſtians are. And ſo we ſee it verified in the Succeſſion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church in our former deductions.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Secondly, It muſt be Univerſal in Time,<note place="margin">True Succeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church muſt be Univerſal both in place and time.</note> for that it muſt not begin from <hi>John Wickliff</hi> only, <hi>Bertramus,</hi> or <hi>Berengarius,</hi> (as <hi>John Fox</hi> doth appoint the Viſibility of his Church) but it muſt come down from the Apoſtles, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure viſibly to the end of the World; yea, from <hi>Abel</hi> himſelf, (as St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſaith) for that even from Him Chriſt inſtituted a viſible Church, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued the ſame by Succeſſion under all three Laws, both of <hi>Naturè,</hi> of <hi>Moyſes,</hi> and of <hi>Grace,</hi> as St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> in his Book <hi>de Civitate Dei</hi> doth declare at large, and in our days Dr. <hi>Sanders</hi> moſt Learnedly, in his Excellent Work <hi>de Viſibili Monarchia,</hi> doth prove the ſame.</p>
               <p n="10">
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:104638:100"/>10. So as this Collection of Sectaries alleged here by <hi>John Fox,</hi> being nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Univerſal in place, nor agreeing in Faith with the Univerſal known Church of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> but with particular Aſſemblies, (one in one place, and another in another) nor yet having Univerſality of Time; as not coming down from the Apoſtles Age, but only for ſome 400 years, as <hi>Fox</hi> himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth: theſe men (I ſay) cannot make a true Church, tho' they have ſome ſparks of true Doctrin among them, as <hi>Fox</hi> braggeth; ſeeing it is true which St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> affirmeth:<note place="margin">Aug. l. de unit. Eccleſ. c. <hi>4.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Quicunque credunt, quòd Chriſtus Jeſus in Carne venerit, &amp; quòd fit Filius Dei,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Et tamen ab ejus Corpore, quod eſt Eccleſia ita diſſentiunt; ut eorum communio non ſit cum toto quacunque diffunditur, ſed in aliqua parte ſeparata inveniatur, manifeſtum eſt eos non eſſe in Catholica Eccleſia;</hi> 
                  <q>Whoſoever doth believe, that Chriſt Jeſus came in Fleſh, and that he is the Son of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that they do ſo diſſent from his Body, that is the Church; as they do not communicate with the whole ſpread over all parts, but only with ſome ſeparate part, it is manifeſt that theſe men are not of the Catholic Church.</q> And thus much of the firſt Condition.</p>

                  </note>11. The ſecond Point to be conſidered is, When the ancient Fathers do ſtand upon viſible Succeſſion of Men as a Note of the true Church, they meant it eſpecially by Biſhops, that come down by continual Succeſſion from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles time to ours: <hi>Eccleſia</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi>) <hi>ab Apoſtolorum temporibus per Epiſcoporum Succeſſiones certiſſimas uſque ad noſtrum, &amp; deinceps tempora, perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat;</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Four Points required in true Succeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic Church.</note>13. Behold here four things eſpecially required by St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> in Succeſſion of men, that muſt demonſtrate a true Church. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the chief Heads thereof muſt be Biſhops. <hi>Secondly,</hi> They muſt ſucceed orderly one to another. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> They muſt come down from the very Apoſtles, as before hath been ſhewed. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Chriſtian Nations muſt agree in the ſame Faith under them. All which four Points are to be found in the Succeſſion of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal <hi>Roman</hi> Church, as you have ſeen; but no one of them (and much leſs all) are to be found in this Rabble of Hereſies and Sectaries, ſcrap'd together by <hi>Fox</hi> in his former Catalogue: For neither were they Biſhops at all, but private men, as after ſhall be ſhewed, (tho' <hi>Fox</hi> moſt falſly doth affirm one of them to have been a Learned Biſhop:) Nor did they ſucceed in Office, Function, Charge or Juriſdiction the one to the other, or concurred in one Time, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, or place; but one in one corner, and another in another: One ſtept up in <hi>Germany,</hi> another in <hi>France,</hi> another in <hi>Italy,</hi> and another in <hi>England;</hi> the

Neither had they any relation one to the other, more than <hi>Botley</hi> to <hi>Billingſgate,</hi> or <hi>Canterbury</hi> to <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> And as for Antiquity, and coming down by Succeſſion from the Apoſtles, they are far from it, as <hi>Fox</hi> himſelf confeſſeth, in that he begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth his Catalogue only from Pope <hi>Innocentius,</hi> 1200 years after Chriſt, as you have heard. So as if Chriſt had any viſible Church before this time, it muſt needs be Ours? by <hi>Fox</hi>'s own confeſſion.</p>
               <p n="14">14. And finally, the laſt Point mentioned here, and ſo highly eſteemed by St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> of the conſent of People and Nations, <hi>tot populorum conſenſione firmatur;</hi> whereof he maketh ſuch account in another place, as he ſaith,<note place="margin">Aug. ep. <hi>48.</hi> ad Vincent.

               </p>
               <p n="15">15. Finally, of this ridiculous Succeſſion of Heretics the ſame holy Father writeth fitly in theſe words:<note place="margin">Aug. ep. <hi>42.</hi> ad Mandrenſ. &amp; tract. <hi>2.</hi> in ep. Joan.</note> 
                  <hi>Videtis certè multos praeciſos à radice Chriſtianae So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietatis, quae per Sedes Apoſtolorum &amp; Succeſſiones Epiſcoporum certa per Orbem pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagatione diffunditur, de ſola figura Originis ſub Chriſtiano nomine quaſi areſcentia ſarmenta gloriari, quas Haereſes &amp; Schiſmata nominamus;</hi> 
                  <q>Truly you ſee many cut off from the root of this Chriſtian Society <hi>(the Church)</hi> which Society is ſpread over all the World by the Seats of the Apoſtles, and Succeſſion of Biſhops, as it were by a moſt certain Propagation or Generation; and theſe Fellows do brag of a certain figure or ſimilitude of a Beginning or Succeſſion under the name of Chriſtians, but are indeed wither'd Branches cut off from the Vine, and theſe we call Heretics and Schiſmatics.</q>

For if they differ, tho' it were but in any one ſubſtantial Point, they cannot be of one Church, nor of one Communion, nor be ſaved together; for that, as there is but one God, one Chriſt, one Church, and one Baptiſm, (as the Apoſtle teſtifieth) ſo is there but one only Faith in the ſame Church to be ſaved by; which all men muſt hold unitedly, wholly and inviolably, or elſe (as in the Creed of St. <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius</hi> is affirmed) <hi>abſque dubio in aeternum peribit,</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>The Search of <hi>John Fox</hi>'s Church is continued under the Government and Reign of K. <hi>Henry VIII.</hi> and his Children: And it is diſcuſſed what manner of Church, <hi>John Fox</hi> then had, or may be imagined to have had.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>HAving made our former ſearch or purſuit for the finding of <hi>Jon Fox</hi> his Church throughout the precedent years, and Ages of the Chriſtian world, from the Apoſtles time, unto the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. and declared moſt evidently (as to us it ſeemeth) that the ſaid Church was never yet to be found in any of thoſe times and Ages, except perhaps in ſome ſuch broken and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible Heretics, and ſo oppoſite and contrary one of them to another, as cannot poſſibly be thought to make a Church, that requireth unity and conformity of Faith: there remaineth now, that we proceed to examin, what may be found for <hi>John Fox</hi>'s purpoſe, under the Reign of K. <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to our time. For that, (as often hath been noted) of this time doth <hi>John Fox</hi> brag and glory in his Book, as of the florishing time of his Goſpel. Which appeareth not only by that he imployeth the half of his whole Volume, in theſe, only thirty years that paſſed between the breach of King <hi>Henry</hi>
                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:104638:105"/>
with the Pope,<note place="margin">A falſe flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Picture ſet out by <hi>Fox</hi> of K. <hi>Henry</hi> VIII.</note> unto the entrance of Queen <hi>Elizabeth:</hi> but alſo by a brave triumphant picture ſet in the firſt page of King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Reign, with his Feet upon the back of Pope <hi>Clement</hi> VII. and other circumſtances of Heretical inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, which preſently we ſhall declare.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But firſt of all you muſt underſtand, that in the 12 laſt pages of K. <hi>Henry</hi> VII.'s Life, it pleaſed <hi>John Fox</hi> to ſet down pleaſantly 12 large printed and paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Pageants of the Popes greatneſs in thoſe days, together with his Papal Caſes reſerved to himſelf, his Dominion both Spiritual &amp; Temporal, his great Riches, the <hi>univerſal</hi> Obedience both of Temporal and Spiritual Princes unto him, and other ſuch like points. All which being but a melancholy meditation, and Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle for Proteſtants, <hi>John Fox</hi> in the next page ſetteth down a merrier contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation: to wit, King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. placed by him in a high Throne with <hi>Clement</hi> VII. under his Feet,<note place="margin">Fox p. <hi>732.</hi>
                  </note> grovelling on the ground, with his Croſs Keys and Triple Crown in the Duſt. Whereat many Friars are painted ſtaring and gazing, and weeping round about, and B. <hi>Fiſher</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Moor</hi> pitifully alſo weeping, and ſtooping down to help him up again. And on the other ſide, K. <hi>Henry</hi> is painted with the Goſpel in his Lap, and his Sword in his right hand, lifted up for defence thereof. Which Goſpel is alſo holpen to be held up by <hi>Cranmer</hi> and <hi>Cromwell,</hi> that on his ſaid right hand do aſſiſt the King with great content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the new Miniſters. Who are painted here to ſtand very gravely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating of the matter with a ſingular comfort: and all other Biſhops, Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots Eccleſiaſtical and Temporal men bewailing and mourning.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And this is <hi>John Fox</hi> his pleaſant (or rather peeviſh) invention, to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the eyes of the ſimple Readers or lookers on, and to make paſtime for Fools, whereof himſelf was a ſolemn Father while he lived. And I would ask the ſilly Fellow here,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Fox</hi> his Page<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> how King <hi>Henry,</hi> tho' he brake with Pope <hi>Clement,</hi> upon ſome mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of diſpleaſure (as is notorious) and refuſed to yield him Spiritual obedience in <hi>England</hi> (as he and his Anceſtors had done ever before:) yet how could he juſtly, or truly be ſaid to have caſt him down with his Crown, and Croſs, as herein painted? Seeing that Pope <hi>Clement</hi> his Authority, power, and Spiritual juriſdiction throughout the Chriſtian World was no leſs after King <hi>Henry's</hi> breach, than before. And albeit the Realm of <hi>England</hi> withdrew Her Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al obedience from him: yet the encreaſe of new Churches in the <hi>Indies,</hi> was of much more Authority, and juriſdiction unto him, and his Succeſſors in that kind, than he or they loſt in <hi>England, Germany,</hi> or other parts, that retired themſelves from his and their obedience.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Further, I would ask this <hi>John Deviſer,</hi> that deviſed this wiſe repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: how could K. <hi>Henry</hi>'s Sword be ſaid to be in Defence of the Proteſtants Goſpel, when, by their own Affirmation he was the greateſt perſecutor of their Brethren that ever was King of <hi>England,</hi> from the beginning of that Monarchy to his days? For ſo ſheweth <hi>Fox</hi> himſelf in that he in his Calendar of Saints, ſetteth down more Martyrs of his Sect, made by King <hi>Henry</hi> only, than by all the other former Kings and Queens of <hi>England,</hi> from the firſt entrance of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith to his time. As we are to ſhew more largely in the Third part of this Treatiſe, when we come to examin his ſaid Calendar. But yet in the mean ſpace,<note place="margin">See from <hi>p.</hi> 663. unto 751. That K. <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>'s Sword was not for the new Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it.</note> if you will have ſome taſt, how favourable K. <hi>Henry</hi> of his own inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was to theſe new Goſpellers: you may read, what <hi>Fox</hi> ſetteth down in the ſecond part of his <hi>Acts and Monuments</hi> of this matter. Where among other complaints of this Kings Reign, you ſhall find in one place, no leſs than four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen whole pages of Names (by way of Table or Catalogue) of godly Men and Women, (as he calleth them) apprehended, perſecuted and impriſoned for the Goſpels ſake by the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> in one year? The King himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the chief Author, and Inciter to the Perſecution, as appeareth by a Letter of the ſaid Kings, written to the ſaid Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> upon the 20. of <hi>Octob.</hi> 1521. and the 13. year of his Reign, which Letter <hi>Fox</hi> doth Regiſter under this Title:
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:104638:105"/>
                  <hi>The Copy of the Kings Letter for the aid of</hi> John Longland <hi>Biſhop of</hi> Lincoln <hi>againſt the Servants of Chriſt, falſely then called Heretics,</hi> &amp;c.<note place="margin">Fox. p. <hi>764.</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Lo here King <hi>Henry</hi> proved to be an Aider and Inciter of Perſecution againſt Goſpellers, termed the Servants of God by <hi>Fox,</hi> but Heretics by the King. And if ſo many of theſe good Fellows were perſecuted by him in one Year, under one Biſhop only, within one Dioceſe; what may be imagined throughout the whole Realm? Truly you may read in <hi>Fox</hi> himſelf very large and lamentable complaints of this King's Reign,<note place="margin">See from p. <hi>887,</hi> to <hi>912.</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain from p. <hi>949,</hi> to <hi>957.</hi>
                  </note> and divers copious Liſts of theſe perſecuted Saints of his Church ſet down by him; eſpecially from the foreſaid year of Chriſt 1521 to 1531, which was the laſt ten years before the breach with the Pope.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But what did he from his breach forward? Did he ſpare the new Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpellers any thing more for his breach with the Pope? Truly it cannot be deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but that for ſome years he wink'd at their doings ſomewhat more than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, conſidering the new difficulties wherein he had caſt himſelf by his new diſunion and breach, as before we have noted in the end of the former Part. But as ſoon as he had put his Domeſtical Affairs in ſome quiet and ſecurity,<note place="margin">That K. <hi>Henry</hi> after his breach with <hi>Rome</hi> was ſtill an enemy to Proteſtants Religion.</note> he returned again to his former courſe and cuſtom of reſtraining theſe new un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly Spirits, by calling them to account for their Innovations, and proceeding juridically againſt them, according to Church Canons, and according to his former judgment in matters of Religion: Which as I might ſhew by divers ways of proof, as well of Acts of Parliament, as Proclamations, Injunctions, and other Declarations of his Will and Opinion in this behalf; ſo will we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege only two or three Examples in the firſt kind, beſides thoſe which we have ſet down in the <note n="*" place="margin">Cap. <hi>12.</hi>
                  </note> former Part.</p>
               <p n="7">7. In the 31ſt year of his Reign, which was ſeven or eight years after his breach with the Pope, there was made an Act for aboliſhing of diverſity of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions about Chriſtian Faith, which beginneth thus: <q>Whereas the King's moſt Excellent Majeſty is by God's Law Supreme Head, immediately under him,<note place="margin">See Stat. <hi>31</hi> H. <hi>8.</hi> cap. <hi>14.</hi>
                     </note> of the whole Church of <hi>England, &amp;c.</hi> intending the conſervation of the ſame Church, in a true, ſincere, and uniform Doctrin of Chriſt's Religion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> Thus beginneth his Preface. And then he determineth, together with the Parliament, <q>That whoſoever ſhall deny the Real Preſence in the Sacrament of the Altar, or affirm that the Communion is neceſſary under both Kinds,<note place="margin">Statutes in Religion made by K. <hi>Henry</hi> againſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants.</note> or that Prieſts may by God's Law take Wives after Prieſthood, or that Vows of Chaſtity are not to be obſerved, or that private Maſſes are not to be ſaid, or that Sacramental and Auricular Confeſſion is not neceſſary, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> All theſe he condemneth as Heretics, and for ſuch to be Apprehended, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned, Condemned, and Burned, as at large is to be ſeen in the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute.</p>
               <p n="8">8. And the very next year after, perceiving that, notwithſtanding his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Statute againſt Proteſtant Opinions, the ſame did grow and were ſpread abroad in <hi>England;</hi> he ordained another Statute, which beginneth thus: <q>Whereas the King's Róyal Majeſty, of his bleſſed and gracious diſpoſition,<note place="margin">Stat. an. <hi>32</hi> H. <hi>8.</hi> c. <hi>26.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> well weighing, that out of ſundry outward parts and places there have ſprung, been ſown, &amp; ſet forth, divers heretical, erroneous, &amp; dangerous Opinions &amp; Doctrins in the Religion of Chriſt, whereby his Grace's Leige-people may be induced to unfaithfulneſs, misbelief, miſcreancy, and contempt of God, to the utter confuſion and damnation of Souls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For this cauſe his Majeſty, according to the very Goſpel and Law of God, meaneth to have matters de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined and declared, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus he writeth in the Statute, remitting himſelf to his further Declaration;<note place="margin">The very Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel againſt our new Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpellers by K. <hi>Henry</hi>'s judgment.</note> which is wholly againſt Proteſtants, whoſe Faith and Religion you ſee here called by the King <hi>unfaithfulneſs, misbelief, miſcreancy, contempt of God, heretical,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:104638:106"/>
erroneous and dangerous Doctrin, tending to utter confuſion and damnation of Souls,</hi> &amp;c. And this proved by the pure Word of God, and the very Goſpel it ſelf, as his Majeſty affirmeth.</p>
               <p n="9">9. And will you have more clear teſtimony of his ſettled judgment againſt Proteſtants than this? But yet hear further. For that the ſame King, divers years afters after this again, towards the end of his days, having had good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the falſhood of Proteſtants in corrupting the very Scriptures them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by their crafty Tranſlations,<note place="margin">K. <hi>Henry</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth the Proteſtant Tranſlation of the Scriptures.</note> Notes, and Commentaries, he was forc'd to forbid under grievous puniſhments the reading of the foreſaid Scriptures in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> which before he had permitted, as appeareth by a peculiar Statute made for that purpoſe, and for inhibiting Proteſtants Books, Sermons, and Preachings, in the 34th and 35th years of his Reign; this Statute being entituled, <hi>An Act for the Advancement of true Religion;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Stat. an. Reg. H. <hi>8.34,</hi> &amp; <hi>35,</hi> c. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> ſaying therein as followeth: <hi>Whereas the King's moſt Royal Majeſty, Sumpreme Head of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>and alſo of</hi> Ireland, <hi>perceiveth that notwithſtanding ſuch holy Doctrins and Docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuments as his Majeſty hath hitherto cauſed to be ſet forth, beſides the great liberty granted unto them in having the New and Old Teſtament among them;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The very true and perfect expoſition of Scriptures preſcribed by K. <hi>Henry</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Proteſtants.</note> 
                  <hi>which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, many ſeditious, arrogant, and ignorant Parſons, pretending to be Learred, have the perfect and true knowledg, underſtanding and judgment of ſacred Scriptures,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>intending to ſubvert the very true and perfect Expoſition thereof, after their perverſe fantaſies, have taken upon them not only to preach, teach, declare,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but alſo by printed Books, Ballads, Plays, Rhythmes, Songs, and other fantaſies, ſubtilly to beguile his Majeſty's Leige-ſubjects,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Behold King <hi>Henry</hi>'s deſcription of Proteſtants, their Wit, Nature, Condition and Doctrin. But now followeth the Remedy. <hi>Wherefore, to ordain and eſtabliſh a certain form of pure and ſincere Teaching, agreeable to God's Word, and true Doctrin of the Catholic and Apoſtolical Church,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Be it enacted, That all manner of Books of the Old and New Teſtament in</hi> Engliſh, <hi>being of the crafty, falſe and untrue Tranſlation of</hi> William Tyndall,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Will. Tyndall</hi>'s Tranſlation of the Scriptures condemned, together with the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants Books.</note> 
                  <hi>and all other Books or Writings in the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Tongue, teaching or compoſing any matter of Chriſtian Religion, contrary to that Doctrin which ſince the year of our Lord</hi> 1540 <hi>is, hath, or ſhall be ſet forth by his Majeſty, is clearly and utterly aboliſhed,</hi> &amp;c. Thus ordained King <hi>Henry</hi> of the Proteſtants Books and Doctrin; and this Cenſure he gave of <hi>William Tyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall</hi>'s Truth and Honeſty in tranſlating the Scriptures, whom <hi>John Fox</hi> calleth <hi>not only the true Servant and Martyr of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Fox p. <hi>981.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>but the Apoſtle alſo of</hi> England <hi>in this our latter Age.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. Wherefore I do not ſee how <hi>Fox</hi> can with any reaſon make King <hi>Henry</hi> to be a Goſpeller of his Religion, or ſo earneſt a Defender of the ſame; or why he ſhould paint him with the Bible in his hand, holden up by <hi>Cranmer</hi> and <hi>Cromwell,</hi> as before hath been ſaid, and ſeen in his Painting; ſeeing he contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ever their Doctrin, and burned the Profeſſors thereof as notorious Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics unto his dying-day: Which is evident by many Examples, but moſt clear and notorious by that of <hi>John Lambert,</hi> a famous <hi>Zuinglian,</hi> with whom in ſolemn public Audience he diſputed in preſence of all his Clergy and Nobility of the Realm,<note place="margin">The ſolemn Judgment &amp; Condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an of <hi>Lambert</hi> by the King. <hi>Anno</hi> 32. <hi>H.</hi> 8.</note> and cauſed <hi>Cranmer</hi> to do the like, and in the end made <hi>Cromwell,</hi> as his Vicar-General, to give the Sentence of Death againſt him, and burn him in <hi>Smithfield;</hi> and this not two years before <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s own Condemnation for like Hereſie by the King's own purſuit, as may appear by the Act of his Condemnation yet extant. And the ſame, no doubt, would he have done with <hi>Cranmer,</hi> (which was the other Upholder of his Arm, to maintain the new Goſpel, according to <hi>Fox</hi> his Picture) if he had known or ſuſpected him, not only for an Upholder of that Hereſie, but that he had ſo much as ſecretly and inwardly favored the ſame. And for this very cauſe did King <hi>Henry</hi> uſe that ſolemn and ſharp Judgment upon <hi>Lambert,</hi> and made <hi>Cranmer</hi> to diſpute
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:104638:106"/>
ſo earneſtly againſt him for the <hi>Real Preſence</hi> (whereof afterward he made alſo the ſaid <hi>Cranmer</hi> write and print a Book for more evident Atteſtation therein;) and to the ſame end he made <hi>Cromwell</hi> to pronounce the Sentence, that all men might ſee and know (but eſpecially his Favorites) that whomſoever he found faulty in that behalf ſhould expect no favor at his hand. Whereupon, when he had ſpoken to <hi>Lambert,</hi> asking him, What he had to ſay more for himſelf why he ſhould not die? And the other falling down on his knees, remitted himſelf to his Princely Mercy. The King anſwered with a loud Voice in theſe words, as <hi>Fox</hi> relateth them: <hi>If you remit your ſelf to my Judgment, you muſt die;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Fox p. <hi>1026.</hi> col. <hi>1.</hi> n. <hi>78.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>for I will be no Patron of Heretics.</hi> And by and by turning himſelf to <hi>Cromwell,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>Cromwell, read the Sentence of Condemnation againſt him; (which</hi> Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well (addeth <hi>Fox</hi>) <hi>was at that time the chief Friend of the Goſpellers) who taking the Schedule of Condemnation in his hand, read the ſame,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Thus writeth <hi>Fox,</hi> and putteth in the Margin this Note: <hi>The King condemneth the Martyr of Chriſt</hi> John Lambert. And again, in another place: <hi>Thus was</hi> John Lambert <hi>in this bloody Seſſion by the King judged and condemned to death,</hi> &amp;c.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Fox</hi> and King <hi>Henry</hi> fallen out.</note> And then ſpeaketh he very diſhonorably of King <hi>Henry</hi> about this matter, citing him to the laſt Day of Judgment to receive his Sentence for that Sentence. So as howſoever they flatter the Memory of this King for gloſing with her Majeſty in outward words, yet it is clear enough what they think of him in their hearts, and ſpeak of him in corners. And howſoever <hi>Fox</hi> paint him out with their Goſpel in his Lap, and Sword in his hand to defend it, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him every-where Goſpeller; yet can they not deny but that the ſharpeſt edge of the Sword fell upon them.</p>
               <p n="13">13. And here I cannot omit to let you hear <hi>Fox</hi>'s complaint of ill luck and misfortune in this behalf, that the King, with <hi>Cranmer</hi> and <hi>Cromwell,</hi> and ſome others of his Goſpel and Goſpellers, ſhould ſo unluckily concur to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning and burning of this fervent Brother of their Goſpel <hi>Lambert. Here</hi> (ſaith <hi>Fox</hi>) <hi>it is much to be marvelled at, to ſee how unfortunately it came to paſs in this mattter, that through the peſtiferous and crafty Counſel of</hi> Gardyner <hi>Biſhop of</hi> Wincheſter, <hi>Sathan did here perform the Condemnation of this</hi> Lambert, <hi>by no other Miniſters than Goſpellers themſelves.</hi> This is <hi>Fox</hi> his complaint, laying all the fault (as you ſee) upon Biſhop <hi>Gardyner,</hi> as tho' he had been able to have induced all theſe Goſpellers, and among others the King himſelf and his Goſpelling Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors to have concurred to the burning of their own Brother <hi>Lambert,</hi> if they had been then of his Goſpel. But the truth is, that none of them at that time were come ſo far forward, as to be <hi>Zuinglians.</hi> For as for the King himſelf, he hated them deadly, both then and unto his dying-day; as alſo the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> tho' he bare ſomewhat more with them than with the other, in reſpect of their holding the Real Preſence in the Sacrament, whereunto he was moſt devout. And as for <hi>Cranmer</hi> and <hi>Cromwell,</hi> it may be that in thoſe days they were a little touched with <hi>Lutheraniſm;</hi> the former, to enjoy his Woman which he kept ſecretly, by whom he was alſo made a <hi>Zuinglian</hi> in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s days; the ſecond, for his Gain and Advancement. Yet the ſaid <hi>Cromwell,</hi> coming ſoon after this to be beheaded, on the Scaffold ſaid theſe words among others, as <hi>Fox</hi> relateth them:<note place="margin">

                  <hi>And now I pray you that be here to bear me record that I die in the Catholic Faith, not doubting of any Article of my Faith, no nor doubting in any Sacrament of the Church.

Whereof I have heard of a certain
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:104638:107"/>
Story not unpleaſant, nor from the purpoſe, which therefore here I will ſet down.</p>
               <p n="17">17. A certain Courtier at that day (ſome ſay it was Sir <hi>Francis Bryan</hi>) talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a Lady that was ſomewhat forward in the new Goſpel about this Book of the King's then lately come forth,<note place="margin">A certain Conference between a Courtier &amp; a Lady about deviſing No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</note> ſhe ſeemed to miſlike greatly the Title thereof, to wit, <hi>Articles deviſed by the King's Highneſs,</hi> &amp;c. ſaying, That it ſeemed not a fit Title to authoriſe matters in Religion, to aſcribe them to a mortal King's device. Whereunto the Courtier anſwered, Truly <hi>(Madam)</hi> I will tell you my conceit plainly: If we muſt needs have devices in Religion, I had rather have them from a King, than from a Knave, as your Devices are; I mean that Knave Frier <hi>Martin,</hi> who not yet 20 years agone was Deviſer of your new Religion, and behav'd himſelf ſo lewdly in anſwering his Majeſty with ſcorn and contempt, as I muſt needs call him a Knave; tho' otherwiſe I do not hate altogether the Profeſſion of Friers, as your Ladyſhip knoweth. Moreover (ſaid he) it is not unknown neither to your Ladyſhip nor Us, that he deviſed theſe new Tricks of Religion, which you now ſo much eſteem and reverence, not for God, or Devotion, or to do Penance, but for Ambition,<note place="margin">Cocl. in vit. Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. &amp; Sur. ann. Dom. <hi>1516, 1517.</hi>
                  </note> and to revenge himſelf upon the Dominican Friers, that had gotten from him the preaching of the Pope's Bulls; as alſo to get himſelf the uſe of a Wench, and that a Nun alſo, which now he holdeth. And ſoon after him again three other married Prieſts, his Scholars, (to wit, <hi>Oecolampadius, Carolſtadius,</hi> and <hi>Zuinglius</hi>) deviſed another Religion of the <hi>Sacramentaries,</hi> againſt their ſaid Maſter. And ſince theſe again, we hear every day of other freſh Upſtarts that deviſe us new Doctrins, and there is no end of Deviſing or Deviſers. And I would rather for my part ſtick to the deviſing of a King, that hath Majeſty in him, and a Council to aſſiſt him, (eſpecially ſuch a King as ours is) than to a thouſand of theſe Companions put together.</p>
               <p n="18">18. It is true (ſaid the Lady) when they are Devices indeed of Men,<note place="margin">The Reply of the Lady with the Courtier's Anſwer.</note> but when they bring Scriptures with them to prove their ſayings, then are they not Mens Devices, but God's Eternal Truth and Word. And will you ſay ſo, <hi>Madam,</hi> quoth he? And do you not remember what ado we had the laſt year about this time with certain <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <hi>Hollanders</hi> here in <hi>England,</hi> whom our Biſhops and Doctors could not overcome by Scriptures, notwithſtanding they held moſt horrible Hereſies, which make my Hairs to ſtand upright to think of them, againſt the Manhood and Fleſh of Chriſt our Savior, and againſt the Virginity of his Bleſſed Mother, and againſt the Baptiſm of Infants, and the like wicked Blaſphemies. I was my ſelf preſent at the Condemnation of four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen of them in <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church in one day, and heard them diſpute and allege Scriptures ſo faſt for their Hereſies, as I was amazed thereat; and after I ſaw ſome of theſe Knaves burned in <hi>Smithfield,</hi> and they went ſo merrily to their Death, ſinging and chanting Scriptures, as I began to think with my ſelf whether their Device was not of ſome value or no; until after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, thinking better of the matter, I bleſſed my ſelf from them, and ſo let them go.</p>
               <p n="19">19 Oh (ſaid the Lady) but theſe were Knaves indeed, that deviſed new Doctrins of their own heads; and were very Heretics, not worthy to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved. But how ſhall I know (quoth the Courtier) that Your Deviſers have not done the like, ſeeing Theſe alleged Scriptures no leſs than They; and did one thing more, which is, that they went to the fire and burned for their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, when they might have lived, which your Frier and his Scholars before named have not hitherto done. And finally <hi>(Madam)</hi> I ſay, as at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning I ſaid, If we muſt needs follow deviſing, we Courtiers had much rather follow a King than a Frier in ſuch a matter. For how many years <hi>(Madam)</hi> have Friers ſhorn their Heads, and no Courtier hath ever follow'd them hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

And ſo I conclude, that the device of a King is of more credit than the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of a Friar. And with this the Lady laugh'd; and ſo the Conference was ended.</p>

               <p n="21">21.

                  <hi>but after that ſhe by ſiniſter inſtigation of ſome about the King was made away, the courſe of the Goſpel began again to decline: But that the Lord then ſtirred up the Lord</hi> Cromwell <hi>opportunely to help in that behalf; who did much avail for the increaſe of God's true Religion, and much more had brought it to perfection, if the peſtilent Adverſaries, maligning the proſperous Glory of the Goſpel, had not by contrary practiſing undermined him, and ſupplanted his vertuous proceedings.</hi>

               <p n="22">22.

The other Example alſo of <hi>Cromwell</hi> is no leſs apparently falſe; for that, beſides the particulars which you have heard before of his aſſiſting to puniſh and burn Proteſtants, and his Sentence of death given againſt <hi>Lambert,</hi> with the Proteſtation he made at his own death of his being Catholic,<note place="margin">The chiefeſt credit of <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi> when new Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers were moſt puniſhed by King <hi>Henry.</hi>
                  </note> and never doubting of any one Point of Catholic Religion: Beſides all this (I ſay) it is notorious, that when the ſevere Statute of Six Articles was made againſt all ſorts of Proteſtants in the 31ſt year of King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Reign, (which was in the Month of <hi>April</hi> 1540, as appeareth both by the Book of Statutes it ſelf, and <hi>Hall, Holinſhead,</hi> and other Chroniclers) <hi>Cromwell</hi> was then in his high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Authority and Favor with the King, as is evident; for that in the time of the very ſame Parliament, beſides all his other great Offices before received, (as of Baron, Chancellor, Knight of the Garter, Maſter of the Jewels, Vicar-General in Spiritual Affairs, and other like Titles) he was created alſo Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and High-Chamberlain of <hi>England;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hol. an. <hi>1540.</hi> pag. <hi>950.</hi>
                  </note> which <hi>Holinſhead</hi> ſetteth down in theſe words: <hi>The 18th of</hi> April <hi>at</hi> Weſtminſter <hi>was Lord</hi> Thomas Cromwell <hi>created Earl of</hi> Eſſex, <hi>and ordained Great Chamberlain of</hi> England, <hi>which Office the Earls of</hi> Oxford <hi>were wont ever to enjoy: Alſo</hi> Gregory <hi>his Son was made Lord</hi> Cromwell, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus writeth he. And if in <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s moſt flouriſhing time this Act of Six Articles came out for puniſhment of Proteſtants, the moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere that can be imagined, how fond and childiſh a babling was that before uſed by <hi>Fox,</hi> when he telleth us, that as long as the good Lord <hi>Cromwell</hi> was in cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, or bare Rule with the King, their Goſpel went proſperouſly, <hi>&amp;c?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="25">25. Well then, by all this we may ſee how poor and troden down a ſtate <hi>John Fox</hi>'s Church and Religion held under King <hi>Henry,</hi> notwithſtanding all his brags, and flattering of him in his Pictures. Which yet, that you may not think we mean only of the temporal or external condition, or contemptibility of his Church, (for of that perhaps he would brag, ſeeing he defines his Church by the words <hi>obſcure and troden down</hi>) I would have you here conſider briefly but two things only for the end of this Chapter, which directly do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain to the true ſpiritual miſery of <hi>Fox</hi>'s Church and Religion in thoſe days under King <hi>Henry,</hi> if a Confuſion of fantaſtical Opinions, Errors and Hereſies may be called a Religion.</p>
               <p n="26">26. The firſt is,<note place="margin">The firſt point of ſpiritual miſery of the Goſpellers Church under King <hi>Henry,</hi> Confuſion.</note> That in King <hi>Henry</hi>'s days (at leaſtwiſe for a great part thereof) the Proteſtants Sects were not yet fully diſtinguiſhed into their Claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes or Orders, but were a great confuſed heap of new Opinions, all going under the name of Goſpellers or Proteſtants, as well <hi>Lutherans, Oecolampadians, Zuing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians,</hi> and other Sacramentaries, as <hi>Waldenſians, Wickliffians, Anabaptiſts, Libertines,</hi> and other ſuch-like. So as in this firſt Heap and Maſs of Goſpellers were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained all the ſeveral Sects that ſince have been diſtinguiſhed; as the four Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and particular parts thereof, were contained (according to the Poets Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction) in that great confuſed <hi>Chaos</hi> of the World before it was diſtinguiſhed; or, to ſpeak more properly, they were as the Bears Whelps when firſt they are born, and new fallen from their Mothers Womb; to wit, certain disform, groſs, confuſed things, which by often licking of their Parents are poliſhed at laſt, and brought to ſome faſhion of handſom Creatures, ſuch as you know Bears Whelps to be.</p>
               <p n="27">27. And even ſo was it in thoſe days with Proteſtants Religion: For that every man that would hold a new Opinion, of what Sect ſoever, or would ſpeak againſt the Catholic Church or Doctrin then uſed, was admitted pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently for a Brother of the new Goſpel, and for a ſincere Servant of God, and holy Goſpeller, (as <hi>John Fox</hi> every-where calleth them without diſtinction) whether he were a <hi>Lutheran, Zuinglian, Anabaptiſt, Waldenſian, Wickliffiſt, Lolhard,</hi> or whatſoever elſe; but ſince that time, this <hi>Chaos</hi> hath been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more diſtinguiſhed and poliſhed, and every ſort of Sectaries divided

And laſtly, concerning King <hi>Edward</hi> VI. ſet down alſo by <hi>Fox</hi> in red Letters, for a ſolemn Confeſſor of his Religion: If we talk of King <hi>Henry</hi>'s time, he was a very young Confeſſor; for that he was ſcarce nine years old, when his Father died. And it is very probable, that the Religion which he at that Age could receive, was rather ſuch as his Father had cauſed him to be taught during his life, than ſuch as it pleaſed <hi>Fox</hi> to aſſign unto him after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. But if <hi>Fox</hi> mean, that he was a Confeſſor of their Religion after his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers death, albeit it be hard to ſay of what Religion the Child would have been if he had lived; yet do I think him rather worthy to be accounted a Martyr of <hi>Fox</hi>'s Church, than a Confeſſor. Seeing it is probable, that the bringing in of that Religion, and change of ſtate left by his Father, was the cauſe of his immature death. For that if matters had remained as his Father left them, and no Protector choſen (as he appointed) nor <hi>Wriotheſley</hi> the Chancellor put out of his Office, nor other Catholic Councellors (moſt faithful to the conſervation of the Kings Blood,) had been diſgraced and diſplaced by that unlucky change: like it is, that the good young King might have lived many fair years more, and his two Siſters never have fallen into thoſe imminent dangers of preſent deſtruction, which they once ſaw themſelves in, by the ambition of the new Goſpelling Faction. But enough of this, and of all the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. Now ſhall we paſs briefly over the reſt that remaineth.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Whether <hi>Fox</hi>'s Church hath had any Place under King <hi>Edward,</hi> Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and Her Majeſty that now Reigneth: and how far it hath been admitted, or is admitted at this day.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>ALbeit <hi>John Fox</hi> did Paint out King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. in the firſt page of his Life, ſitting with his Feet upon the Popes back, and the Goſpel in his Lap, with his Sword lifted up in his right-hand, to defend the ſame (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you have heard:<note place="margin">Two fond Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geants of King <hi>Henry</hi> and K. <hi>Edward.</hi>
                  </note>) yet did he Paint <hi>Cromwell</hi> and <hi>Cranmer</hi> ſtaying up the ſaid Sword, leaſt it ſhould fall upon the Proteſtants themſelves, as we have ſhewed that in effect it did. But now in the firſt page of King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Reign, <hi>Fox</hi> hath a much more ample and triumphant Pageant for the Child above his Father: Who though he were but nine years old, yet ſeemeth <hi>Fox</hi> to make him a fuller Head of the Church, than his Father, placing him in a high Throne of Majeſty, and his ſtretched out Sword in the right Hand, and with the other (which is the left) he delivereth the Goſpel unto the People, and Prelates, that ſtand round about him. Where <hi>Fox</hi> writeth in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent this Note: King <hi>Edward delivering the Bible to the Prelates,</hi> &amp;c. As tho' the Bible had taken Authority from the Childs delivering. Who being ſo tender of Age as he was, (and of likelihood ſcarce able to read the ſame, and
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:104638:110"/>
much leſs to underſtand it) as well he might have delivered them the Poem of <hi>Chaucer,</hi> or the Story of <hi>Guy</hi> of <hi>Warwick,</hi> or of <hi>Bevis</hi> of <hi>Southampton</hi> (if it had been put into his Hand to deliver) as this was by his Uncle the Protector, that knew full near as little of the Contents, as the Child himſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But beſides this Majeſtical repreſentation of delivering the Goſpel, there be two or three other Pageants in the ſame page. The firſt is of pulling down Images with great diligence every where, and burning them,<note place="margin">Other ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Paintings of <hi>Fox.</hi>
                  </note> with this Sentence written under: <hi>The Temple well purged.</hi> And then is there a great Ship, painted with Men, Women, and Children, carrying their Church-Stuff into that Ship; to wit, Bells, Books, Images, and Candles: and amongſt other things alſo, the Bleſſed Sacrament. And over the Ship is written thus: <hi>The Ship of the</hi> Romiſh <hi>Church.</hi> And on the ſide this Sentence: <hi>Ship over your Trinkets, and be packing, you Papiſts.</hi> And thus is <hi>John Fox</hi>'s pleaſant Head de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with theſe Fancies. But who ſeeth not how childiſh this folly is? See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcarce ſix years after this triumph, when Queen <hi>Mary</hi> came in, a Man might have ſaid to him again, and his Fellows: <hi>Ship over your Trinkets, and be packing, you Proteſtants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. But if we conſider indeed, the different Wares, and Trinkets, which this Catholic <hi>Roman</hi> Ship carried away from <hi>England</hi> at that time, and thoſe which the new <hi>Proteſtants</hi> Ship brought in ſoon after from <hi>Germany, Geneva, Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and other Places, we ſhall eaſily diſcover, whether the loſs were great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for our Nation, by the departure of the one, or by the coming in of the other: For that in the <hi>Roman</hi> Ship was carried away,<note place="margin">What the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Ship car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away, and what the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> Ship brought into <hi>England.</hi>
                  </note> not only the bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>crament, as <hi>Fox</hi> ſaith, and Painteth it out (which yet is the higheſt and moſt precious Treaſure, that Chriſt hath left to Chriſtians upon Earth:) but with that alſo all kind of vertue, and honeſty for the moſt part. For that all Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, Gravity, Learning, Piety, Devotion, Peace, Concord, Unity and Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was carried away. And in the new Goſpelling Ship, came in all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Vices: namely of Sedition, Diviſion, Pride, Temerity, Curioſity, Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Senſuality, Impiety, and Atheiſm. And in place of many ſober, honeſt, and grave men, that retired themſelves upon this change, there came running into <hi>England</hi> a main number of wanton <hi>Apoſtata</hi> Prieſts and Friars, each one with his Mate and Dame at his ſide, hungry and turbulent people, as <hi>Friar Bale, Friar Bucer, Friar Coverdale, Friar Martyr,</hi> and other like. Who join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with other of their own Sect in <hi>England,</hi> in ſuch a vein of Innovations, as quickly brought all upon their own Heads. And ſo tho' after all theſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid three Pictures, and <hi>Repreſentations</hi> (to wit, <hi>the Bible diſtributed, the Churches ſpoiled, and the Catholic</hi> Roman <hi>Ship ſent away</hi>). <hi>John Fox</hi> doth make a fourth fair Pageant, of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> kind and comfortable meeting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, at their Communion Table, and their peaceable breaking of Bread. Yet if you conſider what preſently enſued in their actions,<note place="margin">A Picture of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> Agreement.</note> (I mean of their changing, chopping, pulling down, and ſetting up in thoſe few years that it endured) you will eaſily ſee the Fruits of that new Goſpel.</p>
               <p n="4">4. For firſt, all begun with manifeſt perfidiouſneſs againſt the old King, that was dead. For whereas he had two things in abomination above the reſt; Firſt, that his Son ſhould have a Protector (conſidering the fatal events there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in former times) for which cauſe he appointed ſixteen <hi>Tutors,</hi> to govern with equal Authority, during the Minority of his Son; the other, that Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie (but eſpecially <hi>Zwinglianiſm</hi>) ſhould enter into his Realm: both theſe things were determined contrary to the ſaid Kings Will and Ordination, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in three days after his death, and above a dozen before he was buried. For that the young Child being Proclaimed King upon the 28. of <hi>January,</hi> and his Father not buried until the 14. of <hi>February,</hi> his Uncle, the Earl of <hi>Hartford,</hi> was made Protector both of the King, and whole Realm, upon the firſt of

the ſaid Month of <hi>February</hi> following: and this by the private Authority of the greater part of the Executors only, without expecting any Parliament, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Realm, for ſo great a change, and charge, as that was.</p>

And albeit for obtaining the conſents of the greater parts of Executors to this mutation, great advancements and Dignities were promiſed, and ſome of them alſo performed (for that the Lord <hi>Dudley</hi> was made Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> the Lord <hi>Parre</hi> Marqueſs of <hi>Northampton,</hi> the Lord Chancellor <hi>Wriotheſley,</hi> was created Earl of <hi>Southampton,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Seymor</hi> was made Lord <hi>Sudley,</hi> and High Admiral of <hi>England,</hi> and other the like; and this within fifteen days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Protectors Advancement) and tho' hope alſo was given to thoſe, that were Catholicly inclined (as the moſt of them were, if they had followed their Conſciences) that no great alteration of Religion ſhould be made for the preſent: yet twenty days had ſcarce paſſed, after this advancement, but that the Protectors Fingers did ſo eagerly itch to be doing, and tampering about Innovation in Religion,<note place="margin">Holinſhead.

And for that the Chancellor <hi>Wriotheſley</hi> reſiſted the ſame, and would have had it ſtayed until a Parliament might be called; his Office was taken from him, thereby to terrifie others from ſpeaking in like Caſes. Biſhop <hi>Tonſtall</hi> alſo was put beſide the Council for like offence, though he were one of the ſixteen Executors appointed by King <hi>Henry.</hi> So as now the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor would needs have all things abſolutely in his own Hand, both with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Law, and before Law, yea expreſly againſt the Laws of King <hi>Henry</hi> yet in force.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And for that both he and his followers did eaſily ſee, the affection of the Realm to be wholly againſt theſe Mutations, (as before we have ſhewed in the end of our former part:) he deviſed with the Lord <hi>Dudley,</hi> who ſoothed him in all at that time, the Journey into <hi>Scotland,</hi> of <hi>Muſſelborough</hi> Field which all men know,<note place="margin">The Journey into <hi>Scotland,</hi> why it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s time.</note> under pretence to gain the young Queen by force to Marry with the King.

Neither was King <hi>Edward</hi> of ſuch Age, as they needed to have haſtened ſo much, to get him a Wife ſo ſoon (he being but nine years old) but that the matter might have been treated peaceably with the <hi>Scots,</hi> to have concurred willingly for their own intereſt, to that conjunction of both Realms by that Marriage, according as they had done in King <hi>Henry</hi>'s time. And ſo wrote Biſhop <hi>Gardener</hi> to the Protector, preſently upon the firſt Sermon he heard the Biſhop of St. <hi>Davids</hi> in <hi>Wales,</hi> make in <hi>London,</hi> about that matter, I mean, to exhort the people to the enterpriſe of <hi>Scotland.</hi> For that now all Preachers were ſet a work by the ſaid Protector, and Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> to ſhew the great Glory and utilities of that Attempt.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But the true cauſe of this Enterpriſe was indeed, to have thereby a juſt pretence, and occaſion to raiſe an Army within the Land, and to call in Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Forces (as they did both <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Italians,</hi> under <hi>Petro Gamboa</hi> that had ſerved King <hi>Henry</hi> at <hi>Bologne,</hi> and other Leaders) who they thought would be always more ſure unto them, than <hi>Engliſh</hi> Soldiers in occaſions of Religion. And ſo it fell out indeed. For the very next year after, theſe Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Soldiers, did ſtand the Protector in very good ſtead, when divers Shires of the Realm took Arms for defence of their Religion, in the third year of King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Reign, as after you ſhall hear.</p>
               <p n="8">8. This then was the firſt Summers work after King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Coronati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: to wit, that the Protector made his Voyage towards <hi>Scotland,</hi> having

firſt ſent Commiſſioners and Preachers (as you have heard) into all Shires, to preach againſt Images, Proceſſion, Litanies, Pilgrimages, Maſs, praying to Saints: And this of his own Authority, without and againſt Law; for that no Parliament had yet diſannulled the Religion left by King <hi>Henry.</hi> Which thing ſo much grieved the common Catholic people, as they began to exclaim every where againſt the ſaid Commiſſioners; and one of them, called <hi>Body,</hi> was ſlain in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> for which divers Men were Executed in ſundry places of that Shire, and a Prieſt ſent up to be Hang'd, Drawn and Quarter'd in <hi>Smithfield,</hi> for the terror of others, for that he was ſaid by ſome to have been Acceſſary to the ſaid <hi>Body</hi>'s death.</p>
               <p n="9">9. And this was the beginning of planting new Religion in <hi>England,</hi>

Which thing being ſignified to the Protector, both before his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and while he was in the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Journey, it grieved him exceedingly, and wrote back to <hi>Cranmer, Ridley,</hi> and the reſt, that they ſhould ſeek ſome means of Agreement and Conformity, and that they ſhould make haſt to end the Common-Service-Book, or Book of Common Prayer, Doctrin, and Rites, which they had begun to treat of before his departure out of <hi>London.</hi>

Yet a Parliament being called together upon the Fourth of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember, Anno Domini</hi> 1547, and the Firſt of King <hi>Edward,</hi> they thought to give an attempt, to ſee what might be done to have ſome Alteration eſtabliſhed.

                  </note> For that in this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament they gat only two things of moment to be determined about Religion. The firſt was, that all former penal Statutes made againſt any Heretic or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctary whatſoever, from King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third downward (to wit, for the ſpace almoſt of 200 years) ſhould be revoked: But namely the Statutes made againſt <hi>Lollards, Wickliffians, Huſſits, Anabaptiſts,</hi> and the reſt, in the 1. Year of King <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, and in the 2. Year of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth, and in the 25.31.33.34 and 35. Years of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, againſt what Hereſies, Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics or Sectaries ſoever. All theſe Laws and Statutes (I ſay) were recalled, annulled, and taken away, together with their puniſhments, prohibitions, or other reſtraints whatſoever; So as now every Man might think, ſay, preach, or teach what he thought beſt.<note place="margin">Liberty and Impunity granted to all Heretics.</note> And this judgeth <hi>Fox</hi> to be a goodly ſweet Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the Goſpel, where no Man is bound nor forced to any thing. And this determined a Child of Nine years old, againſt the Decrees of all his pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Anceſtors for 200 years upward.</p>
               <p n="14">14. But yet in all this free liberty of Sectaries, to ſay, write, and teach what they liſt, the puniſhment of Death was reſerved unto Catholics, that ſhould ſpeak in defence of the Doctrin of the Pope's Supremacy, or in derogation of the Supreme Eccleſiaſtical Headſhip of this young King. And this was the firſt and principal beginning of the Goſpel in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s time, to give every Man liberty to do and believe what he would, ſo he were not a Catholic. Which is much like the opening of Priſons and common Jayls in the beginning of a Rebellion, when all Malefactors are made free from fear of Laws, ſo they will joyn in Faction with the Rebellious. And upon the opening of this Gate, no marvail tho' all Sectaries ruſhed in, and among others, divers <hi>Arians, Anabaptiſts, Trinitarians,</hi> and like Heretics, began to preach pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently their Doctrins, with ſuch publicity, as <hi>Cranmer</hi> and his Fellows, for repreſſing thereof, were enforced to ſit in publick Judgment, and condemn divers of them to Death; albeit I do not ſee by what Law, having now revoked and annulled all former Statutes made againſt Heretics
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:104638:112"/>
for their puniſhment, as hath been ſaid: And namely, he condemned <hi>Joan</hi> of <hi>Kent,</hi> (alias <hi>Joan Knell</hi>) that had been a Handmaid of <hi>Anne Askew,</hi>

Two other things were attempted by the Goſpellers, with moſt earneſt endeavor, but they could not be obtained. The firſt was to have a Book of Common Prayer paſs, which they had compoſed in haſt out of the Maſs-Book, for altering the Service and Maſs into <hi>Engliſh,</hi> or rather for aboliſhing of the Maſs, and bringing in the new Communion in place thereof.

And miſliked moreover the whole Government Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical in that time; neither agreed with the Opinions of Doctrin ſet down by that Book.

               <p n="25">25. And now Candles, Aſhes, and Images being gone (as you ſee) there followed in the next Month after, (to wit, of <hi>March</hi>) that the Protector de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring ſtill to go forward with his deſignment of Alteration, ſent abroad a
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:104638:114"/>
Proclamation in the Kings Name, with a certain Communion Book in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh,</hi> to be uſed for Adminiſtration of Sacraments, inſtead of the Maſs Book. but whether it was the very ſame, that was rejected a little before in the Parliament,<note place="margin">A new Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion Book thruſt upon <hi>Catholics</hi> by the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor's only Authority. <hi>Fox p.</hi> 1184. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.</note> or another patched up afterward, or the ſame mended or altered, is not ſo clear. But great care there was had by the Protector and his Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, that this Book ſhould be admitted, and put in practice preſently, even before it was allowed in Parliament. To which effect <hi>Fox</hi> ſetteth down a large Letter of the Council to all the Biſhops, Exhorting and Commanding them, in the King's Name to admit, and put in Practice this Book. <hi>We have thought good</hi> (ſay they) <hi>to pray and require your Lordſhips, and nevertheleſs in the King's Majeſty Our moſt Dread Lord's Name to Command You, to have a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, earneſt, and careful reſpect to cauſe theſe Books to be delivered to every Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Vicar and Curate within your Dioceſe, with ſuch diligence as they may have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient time well to inſtruct and adviſe themſelves, for the diſtribution of the moſt holy Communion, according to the Order of this Book before this</hi> Eaſter <hi>time,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Praying you to conſider, that this Order is ſet forth, to the intent there ſhould be in all parts of the Realm, one <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niform manner quietly uſed.

               <p n="26">26. By all which, and by much more that might be alleged, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that all that was hitherto done againſt Catholic Religion for theſe firſt two years, until the ſecond Parliament, was done by private Authority of the Protector and his Adherents,<note place="margin">The Confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that inſued in <hi>England</hi> upon the firſt Innovation.</note> before Law, and againſt Law. And now what a <hi>Babylonical</hi> Confuſion enſued in <hi>England</hi> upon theſe Innovations in all Churches, Pariſhes and Biſhopricks commonly, is wonderful to recount. For ſome Prieſts ſaid the <hi>Latin</hi> Maſs, ſome the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Communion, ſome both, ſome neither: ſome ſaid half of the one, and half of the other. And this was very ordinary: to wit, to ſay the <hi>Introitus</hi> and <hi>Confiteor</hi> in <hi>Engliſh:</hi> and then the Collects, and ſome other parts in <hi>Latin.</hi> And after that again the Epiſtles and Goſpels in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and then the Canon of the Maſs in <hi>Latin,</hi> and laſtly the Benediction, and laſt Goſpel in <hi>Engliſh.</hi> And this mingle mangle did every man make at his pleaſure, as he thought it would be moſt grateful to the people.</p>
               <p n="27">27. But that which was of more importance, and impiety; ſome did Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate Bread and Wine, others did not, but would tell the people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand plainly, they would not conſecrate: but reſtore them their Bread and Wine back again, as they received it from them. Only adding to it the Church Benediction. And thoſe that did Conſecrate, did Conſecrate in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers forms, ſome aloud, ſome in ſecret, ſome in one form of words, and others in an other. And after Conſecration ſome did hold up the Hoſt to be Adored after the old faſhion, and ſome did not; And of thoſe that were preſent, ſome did kneel down and Adore, others did ſhut their Eyes, others turned their Faces aſide, others ran out of the Church Blaſpheming, and crying Idolatry.</p>
               <p n="28">28. And as this Confuſion was in Spiritual Matters, during theſe two firſt years of King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Reign: ſo no leſs was it in Temporal Affairs, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in tne City of <hi>London,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The troubles and garboils in Temporal Affairs, enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Confuſion.</note> where a great Mortality and Peſtilence was among the People, as <hi>Stow</hi> ſaith.

                  <hi>Bale</hi> was wholly addicted to Queen <hi>Catherine</hi> and her praiſes, having Printed and ſet her forth, in thoſe very days for a famous Writer, and one of the Miracles of Womankind in his Book <hi>De ſcriptoribus Britannicis.</hi> For ſo he ſaith:<note place="margin">Bal. de ſcript.

               <p n="29">29. But now came on the ſecond Parliament,<note place="margin">The ſecond Parliament of King <hi>Edward. An.</hi> 1548. 4. <hi>Novemb.</hi>
                  </note> which was upon the 4. day of <hi>November</hi> 1548. and ſecond year of King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Reign. The Protector, and his Goſpellers, had made all the preparation poſſible to get Voice therein, for Eſtabliſhing of that, which they deſired in Religion. As it is no marvel, if it were not hard to do, ſeeing the chief Biſhops were now reſtrained, terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, or put in Priſon; ſome other of the Laity alſo diſgraced, as the Earl of <hi>Southampton, Arundell,</hi> and others. The Lord Protector and <hi>Dudley,</hi> Armed with the remainder of their Forces made for <hi>Scotland.</hi> And the diſpleaſure of the ſaid Protector being held now for ſo dreadful a matter to any that reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Deſigns, as it was expected daily, that his own Brother the Admiral ſhould be made away by him upon like diſpleaſure</p>
               <p n="30">30. But to ſpeak of this Parliament begun now (as we have ſaid) two things (as you remember) were excluded in the laſt Parliament, that could not paſs, though never ſo much deſired, and urged by the Protector and his Friends. To wit, the new Communion Book, and the allowance of Prieſts and Friers Marriages: but now both of them paſſed; albeit the ſecond with a greater limitation, as you may ſee, for the Title of the Statute is only this, <hi>An Act to take away all Poſitive Laws of Man made againſt the Marriage of Prieſts.</hi> Whereby you ſee, that the Parliament being importuned by Prieſts and Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that had gotten them Women, to have them allowed by Parliament; they only obtained to be free from Temporal Puniſhment appointed for the ſame, leaving them to God for the reſt, whether after their Vows made of Chaſtity, they were bound to obſerve the ſame, or no. Nay, in the very Act it ſelf, they do highly commend Chaſtity in Prieſts, ſaying: <hi>That it were not only better for Prieſts and Miniſters of the Church to live Chaſt, ſole,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Statut. Anno</hi> 2. <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 21. <hi>Anno Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini</hi> 1548. The Statute of Impunity for Prieſts and Friers to Marry.</note> 
                  <hi>and ſeparate from the company of Women,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But that it were moſt to be wiſhed, that they would willingly, and of themſelves endeavor to keep a perpetual Chaſtity, and Abſtinence from the uſe of Women. Yet foraſmuch as the contrary hath been ſeen,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Be it Enacted that all Laws Poſitive, Canons, or Conſtitutions heretofore made by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Man only (which doth Prohibit or forbid Marriage to any Eccleſiaſtical Perſon</hi>) &amp;c. <hi>Shall be utterly void and of none effect, together with the Pains, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties, Crimes, Actions thereunto Annexed,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="31">31. Thus goeth the Statute. Wherein you ſee there is nothing, but Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity given to Incontinent Prieſts and Friers, to uſe Women without fear of Puniſhment in this World. And thereby you may conſider, that the firſt and chief endeavors of theſe new Goſpellers tended principally to break down Hedges, and to diſſolve Catholic Diſcipline, and to take away Puniſhments appointed as well to Heretics and Hereſie in general (as by the former Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment you have ſeen) as alſo to looſe and Incontinent Clergy-men for their diſſolute life. And thus much of the firſt Point. Let us come to the ſecond, about the new Communion Book.</p>
               <p n="32">32. This Book, though it were made new again by great diligence, both of the Compoſers, which the Protector and his Followers had choſen for that
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:104638:115"/>
purpoſe, as alſo by the view of <hi>Cranmer, Ridley,</hi> and others of chief Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Clergy:<note place="margin">The ſecond Contention about their new Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion Book.</note> yet had it marvellous difficulty to paſs, as may appear by very Act of Parliament it ſelf. For that it was not only contradicted by Catholics, but alſo by many Proteſtants themſelves: Miſliking not only the Rites and Ceremonies therein appointed, but the very Articles of Doctrin al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. And in this were moſt vehement the foreſaid Faction of <hi>Hooper, Rogers, Latymer,</hi> and ſome others, being at that time Puritans, as before we have noted.</p>
               <p n="33">33. But the chiefeſt, and hotteſt Contention of all (whereof the principal Point of their new Religion ſeemed to depend) was, whether they ſhould be <hi>Lutherans,</hi> or <hi>Zwinglians,</hi> concerning the bleſſed Sacrament. Seeing they longer well could not diſſemble the ſame, as they had done in the former Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament: though otherwiſe (as I have ſaid) it was ſomewhat hard to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min. For that to the <hi>Lutherans</hi> enclined not only <hi>Cranmer, Ridley,</hi> and other in Eccleſiaſtical Authority, that had lived, and born Rule under King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. before. But many of the Noble Men alſo, and Counſellors, that were half Catholics and half Proteſtants. Proteſtants, for liberty of eating of Fleſh on forbidden days, Poſſeſſing Church-Livings, diſobligation of Confeſſion, and Reſtitution, and other ſuch Motives: But yet for other matters were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Catholic in judgment, and with theſe concurred ſuch, as were come out of <hi>Saxony,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The <hi>Zwinglian</hi> Faction did o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-bear the <hi>Lutheran</hi> in King <hi>Edwards</hi> days.</note> and had Studied under <hi>Luther,</hi> as <hi>Bucer, Bale, Coverdale,</hi> and others. All which ſeemed to ſtand for the real Preſence at that time. But againſt theſe were the Sacramentaries, whoſe Profeſſion being of the freſher Frame, more pleaſed the Protector, and ſome other itching Ears, and thereby did overbear the other ſide, at length by the number of ſome few Voices in Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, but yet with great difficulty. Whereupon the ſaid Parliament was continued in Diſputation, and Contention, eſpecially about this matter for the ſpace of four Months and a half; to wit, from the 4. of <hi>November,</hi> unto the 14. of <hi>March,</hi> and in the mean ſpace, all was in ſuſpence, of what Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion <hi>England</hi> ſhould be. For as on the one ſide many that knew or ſuſpected the Protectors inclination, did think and lay Wagers, that <hi>Zwinglianiſm</hi> would prevail: ſo others hearing that Archbiſhop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> and his party ſtood reſolutely on the other ſide, and had puniſhed divers for ſpeaking againſt the Maſs,<note place="margin">Two men caſt into Priſon by <hi>Cranmer</hi> for ſpeaking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Altar. <hi>Fox p.</hi> 1180. <hi>&amp;</hi> 1181.</note> and <hi>Real Preſence</hi> in the Sacrament a little before, to wit, one <hi>Thomas Dobbe</hi> a Maſter of Art in <hi>Cambridge</hi> (as <hi>Fox</hi> telleth us) caſt into the Counter by <hi>Cranmer,</hi> and held there till he died: and <hi>John Hume,</hi> Impriſoned for the ſame Cauſe by the ſaid Archbiſhop: This (I ſay) made many to expect and Bett on the other ſide. But eſpecially this doubt, and expectation was notorious in the Univerſities of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> and <hi>Bucer,</hi> had Read now for the ſpace of a year and more, and were often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times urged and preſſed much by their Scholars, (whereof the far greater parts in thoſe days were Catholics,) to declare themſelves clearly, of what Opinion they wear, touching the Sacrament of the Altar, and the Real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; To wit, whether they were <hi>Lutherans</hi> or <hi>Zwinglians.</hi> But they kept themſelves aloof, and indifferent or rather doubtful, ſo far as they could, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the determination of the Parliament ſhould come. Yet was <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> put into a great ſtrait thereby. For that having taken upon him to Read, and Expound to the Scholars of <hi>Oxford</hi> the firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Apoſtle in the Eleventh Chapter handleth the Inſtitution of the Bleſſed Sacrament) he had thought to have come to that place juſt at the very time, when the Parliament ſhould have determined this Controverſie.</p>
               <p n="34">34. But the Contention enduring longer by ſome Months, than he expected, he was come to the Eleventh Chapter long before they could end in <hi>London.</hi> Whereupon many Poſts went to and fro between him and <hi>Cranmer,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:104638:115"/>
a ſpeedy reſolution,<note place="margin">The perpl ex ty of <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> in <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> about ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding <hi>Hoc eſt Corpus meum.</hi>
                  </note> alleging that he could not detain himſelf any long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but that being come to the words <hi>Hoc eſt Corpus meum,</hi> he muſt needs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare himſelf a <hi>Lutheran</hi> or a <hi>Zuinglian:</hi> But he was willed to ſtay, and entertain himſelf in other matter, until the Determination might come; and ſo the poor Frier did, with admiration and laughter of all his Scholars, ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon thoſe precedent words; <hi>Accepit Panem,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Et gratias agens,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Fregit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Et dixit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Accipite, &amp; manducate,</hi> &amp;c. diſcourſing largely of every one of theſe Points, and bearing off from the other that enſued. But when at length the Poſt came that <hi>Zuinglianiſm</hi> muſt be defended, then ſtepped up <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> boldly the next day, and ſaid, <hi>Hoc eſt Corpus meum,</hi>

Whereas if the Poſt had brought other News, himſelf alſo would have taught the contrary Opinion. And this Story was teſtified (whil'ſt they were alive) by Dr. <hi>Sanders,</hi> Dr. <hi>Allen,</hi> Dr. <hi>Stapleton,</hi> and others, that were preſent at this Trifling and Tergiverſation of this Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate-Frier. And thus began our <hi>Zuinglian</hi> Goſpel in <hi>England</hi> under King <hi>Edward</hi> VI.</p>
               <p n="35">35. Now let us hear a word or two out of the Statute it ſelf about this Communion Book, and profeſſion of <hi>Zuinglianiſm,</hi> eſtabliſh'd in <hi>England,</hi> after two years ſtrife among the Proteſtants. <hi>Whereas of long time</hi> (ſaith the Act) <hi>there hath been in this Realm of</hi> England <hi>divers Forms of Common Prayer,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Stat. an. <hi>2</hi> Ed. <hi>6</hi> cap. <hi>1.</hi>

                  <hi>commonly called the Service of the Church, as well concerning the</hi> Mattins <hi>and</hi> Even-Song, <hi>as alſo the holy Communion, called the</hi> Maſs, <hi>&amp;c. And whereas the King's Majeſty, with the Advice of his moſt entirely-beloved <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle the Lord Protector, and others of his Highneſs's Council, hath heretofore divers times aſſayed to ſtay Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or new Rites concerning the premiſes; yet the ſame hath not had ſuch good ſucceſs as his Highneſs required in that behalf. Whereupon his Highneſs, by the moſt prudent Advice aforeſaid,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The new Communion-Book made upon the frailty and weakneſs of Subjects.</note> 
                  <hi>being pleaſed to bear with the frailty and weakneſs of his Subjects in that behalf, of his great Clemency hath been not only content to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from puniſhment in that behalf, but alſo, to the intent that an uniform, quiet, and godly Order ſhould be had concerning the premiſſes, hath appointed the Archbiſhop of</hi> Canterbury, <hi>and certain of the moſt learned and diſcreet Biſhops, to conſider and ponder the premiſes; and thereupon, having as well an eye and reſpect to the</hi> moſt ſincere and pure Chriſtian Religion taught by the Scriptures, <hi>as to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſages of the Primitive Church, ſhould draw and make one convenient and meet Order, Rite, and Faſhion of Common-Prayer and Adminiſtration of Sacraments to be uſed in</hi> England, Wales, <hi>&amp;c. The which at this time, by the Aid of the Holy Ghoſt, with uniform Agreement, is by them concluded ſet forth, and delivered, to his Highneſs's great comfort, and quietneſs of mind, in a Book entituled,</hi> The Book of Common-Prayer and Adminiſtration of Sacraments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="36">36. This is the Preface to that Act of Parliament; whereby you may ſee that this Communion-Book was devis'd firſt for bearing with the frailty of them that ſought Innovations; &amp; then that it was perform'd by uniform Conſent, &amp; Aid of the Holy Ghoſt, according to the <hi>moſt ſincere and pure Chriſtian Religion taught in the Scriptures;</hi> and laſtly, that the young Child-Prince received <hi>great comfort and quietneſs of mind thereby.</hi> All which is ridiculous, if you conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what a multitude of Errors and groſs Abſurdities the latter Proteſtants (eſpecially the preciſer ſort of them) have gathered out againſt this Book; yea, after it was twice more reviewed, altered and amended, <hi>(according to the pure Word of God)</hi> as was pretended once in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s days it ſelf, and then again in the beginning of her Majeſties Reign; whereof, tho' I have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſufficiently in my Defence of the firſt Encounter againſt Sir <hi>F. Haſtings,</hi> yet cannot I omit to admoniſh the Reader in this place to read the ninth Chapter
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:104638:116"/>

               </p>

And for that the Protector had deſigned to raiſe a famous Palace, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of his Greatneſs and Renown, for his Habitation and perpetual Memory, called <hi>Somerſet-Place,</hi> he firſt cauſed the Pariſh Church of the <hi>Strand</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Temple-Bar,</hi> together with <hi>Strand-Inn</hi> and <hi>Strand-Bridge,</hi> to be pull'd down, to give place to that Palace; and to the end he might have Stone for the ſame more near at hand, and with leſs Charges, he cauſed the fair goodly Church of St. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> near <hi>Smithfield</hi> (belonging in former time to the Knights of <hi>Rhodes</hi>) to be undermin'd, and with Gunpowder to be overthrown, and the Stone thereof to be applied to the building of his ſaid Houſe and Palace.</p>
               <p n="42">42. And this was the form of the firſt planting of the new Goſpel in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> by Gunpowder, tearing and renting of ancient Monuments, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing of Churches; far unlike to the firſt planting of Chriſtian Faith in <hi>England</hi> by St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> and his Fellows, before in part by us deſcribed. And if this Revel was in <hi>London</hi> in the ſight of the Prince and Council, and where moſt Order and Law ought to be kept, we may eaſily imagin what was pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed throughout all the other parts of the Realm, where leſs reſpect was born to the public Magiſtrate, by no leſs unruly Spirits than were in <hi>London;</hi> whereupon the poor afflicted Catholic people were forced to take Arms for their defence.

                  </note> together with a moſt humble, lowly and baſe Submiſſion made by the ſaid Protector, (which is extant in our Chronicles) moved the Earl to pardon him for the preſent, and to reſtore him to a kind of Liberty at his own Houſe, and after that again to the Council and King's preſence, (for of all he was deprived) but never to the Protectorſhip: Nay, ſoon after he caſt him into Priſon again, and cut off his Head, as all men know; and had there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the help of many chief Goſpellers, who not long after this laid other Complots (conform to the turbulent humor and fruits of this Goſpel) and made other new Alliances between the Houſe of <hi>Suffolk</hi> (that was moſt forward of all others in Goſpelling) and the ſaid Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> now Duke of <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umberland;</hi> which Alliances are ſuppoſed to have ſhortned the young unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate King's Life, and known to have meant the Subverſion of the whole Courſe of the Royal Line and Succeſſion appointed by King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII.

Wherefore, to be no longer in this matter, which is clear enough of it ſelf, we do ſee how the firſt public Introduction of Proteſtant Religion that ever was admitted in <hi>England,</hi> from Chriſt to that time, came in both under King <hi>Henry,</hi> and much more under King <hi>Edward</hi> his Son; to wit, how, and upon what occaſions, by whom and what men the ſame was both preached and favored, and what effects, by what means, and in what form and faſhion it was performed;<note place="margin">The concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on concerning the occaſions, means, events, and fruits of the new Goſpel.</note> for as for the occaſions, they have been declared before: But under King <hi>Edward,</hi> it is evident that they were the Childhood and Infancy of a tender young Prince, together with the Ambition, Covetouſneſs, Pride, and deſire of ſole Command, in his Uncle the Protector; which motives made him break the Will and Teſtament, Laws and Ordinances, of his old Dread Lord King <hi>Henry,</hi> before almoſt his Blood was cold after his death: and the like In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of Promotions drew after him others, who ſeconded his Actions as long as they were profitable unto them.</p>
               <p n="44">44. As for the men that firſt and principally broached theſe Doctrins, they were for the moſt part married Friers and Apoſtate Prieſts that living in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence of Women, and other Senſuality, deſired to maintain and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue the ſame by the Liberty of this new Goſpel. The Promoters and Favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of theſe Men were ſuch eſpecially of the Laity and Clergy, as had more Intereſt by the Change for their own Promotion and Advancement, than Conſcience, or perſuaſion of Judgment, for the Truth of their Religion; as would appear, if we ſhould name them one by one that then were of the Council and chief Authority. The Effects and ſpiritual Fruits of this firſt Change were (as you have ſeen and heard) the moſt notorious Vices of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, Diſſimulation, Hatred, Deceit, Tyranny, and Subverſion one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; together with Diviſion, Diſſention, Garboils, and Deſolation of the Realm; yea, plain Atheiſm, Irreligion, and contempt of all Religion that ever was known to have riſen up in any Kingdom of the World within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of ſo few years: And (that which is moſt remarkable) there followed preſently the Overthrow of all the principal Actors and Authors of theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations by God's own wonderful hand; and this more in theſe ſix years, than in ſixty, or ſix ſcore or perhaps ſix hundred, hath been ſeen to have fallen out in <hi>England</hi> in other times.

Providence of God did ſhew a notorious document to the whole World, of the falſhood and wickedneſs of this new Goſpel, in that the firſt profeſſors and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moters thereof in our Land, fell to more open wickedneſs in theſe Five years, than in ſo many Fifties before, as hath been ſaid.</p>
               <p n="45">45. And the chief Captain and Ringleader of all this Dance of Innovations after the Protector himſelf, (to wit, the Duke of <hi>Northumberland</hi>) coming ſoon after to Calamity, fell into the accompt and reckoning of this matter, and made a long vehement declaration thereof in the Chappel of the <hi>Tower,</hi> before divers of the Council, the day before he was put to death, to wit, upon the 21. of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1553, ſhewing, that he had found true by good experience, that this new Goſpel (which he had followed hitherto) tended to nothing but to Atheiſm in Religion, diſſolution of Life, and perturbation of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; which he repeated again at his Death, and the ſame was preſently put in Print, and ſo it remained.

                  <hi>even from the bottom of my Heart, that this which I have ſpoken, is of my ſelf, not being required nor moved thereunto by any man, for any flattery or hope of Life. I take witneſs of my Lord of</hi> Worceſter <hi>here, my old Friend and Ghoſtly Father, that he found me in this mind and opinion when he came to me.

               <p n="48">48. And thus much of thoſe Men and their Fruits, who firſt planted this Goſael. But now as for the Means whereby theſe things were wrought, you have heard them before; that they were all commonly by pulling down, thruſting out, diſſolving of Diſcipline, giving immunity from puniſhments to all ſorts of Heretics, and of Marriage to looſe Prieſts and Apoſtate Friers, and other like licentious Liberties, far different from the purity, ſeverity, and ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Life uſed by the firſt Planters of Chriſt's Goſpel. And as for the form and faſhion of this new Religion, ſet up under this Child-King, it was, as you
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:104638:118"/>
have heard both their own Men and ours teſtifie,<note place="margin">The form and faſhion of <hi>Fox</hi>'s new Church and Religion.</note> compounded and patched up of all diverſity of Sects and Religions, as it pleaſed the Compoſers; many things they took and retained of ours, as well in Doctrin, as in Rites and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies; Some things of the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> ſome others of the <hi>Zuinglians;</hi> ſome of the Relicks of King <hi>Henry</hi>'s mutation, as that of the Supreme Head of the Church, (a ſingular Point of Doctrin, proper to <hi>England</hi> above all other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.) But moſt of this Compoſition was of their own Inventions, which yet neither the Proteſtants that remained in ſecret under Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> did wholly allow, as appeareth by that which I have cited before of <hi>John Rogers</hi>'s Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, nor the other that began again under her Majeſty that now is, did wholly readmit the form and faſhion, but made a new one of their own, as by their Communion-Book is evident; nor do the purer ſort of <hi>Calviniſts</hi> in theſe days, any way like or approve the one or the other, as before we have ſhewed.</p>
               <p n="49">49. Whereupon I may conclude as well this Chapter, as alſo this whole Second Part, that neither under King <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII. nor King <hi>Edward</hi> the VI. nor Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> had <hi>John Fox</hi> any diſtinct Church extant or known to the World, eſpecially if his Church be the <hi>Puritan</hi> Congregation, as he will ſeem to ſignifie in many places of his <hi>Acts and Monuments.</hi> But whether he have any ſuch Church now viſible under her Majeſty at this day in <hi>England,</hi> and in what ſtate and condition it ſtandeth, I will not ſtand to enquire or diſcuſs, but do leave it to my Lords of <hi>Lambert</hi> and <hi>London,</hi> whom moſt it concerneth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſufficient for me to have ſhewed throughout all former Chriſtian Ages, that <hi>John Fox</hi> hath had no Church of any Antiquity; and conſequently, if he he have any now, it muſt be a very young Church, and of ſo tender Age, as he may marry her to what Sect or Sectary he liſteth for her Youth, and that with hope of Brood and Iſſue.

And finally it ſeemeth to me,<note place="margin">A Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon expreſſing the different dealing of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholics and Proteſtants a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſeeking the true Church and Religion.</note> that the difference between us and him and his, to wit, between Catholics and Proteſtants in this behalf, is not much unlike to that of two Cloth-ſellers of <hi>London,</hi> the one a Royal Merchant, which layeth open his Wares clearly, giveth into your hands the whole piece of Cloth at mid-day, willeth you to view and behold it in the Sun, removeth all veils, pentices, and other ſtoppings of light that may give obſcurity, or impediment to the manifeſt beholding, handling and diſcerning thereof; Whereas con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe the other, being a crafty Broker, or poor Pedlar, having no ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Wares indeed to ſell, but ſuch as are falſe made, and deceitfully wrought, and taken up alſo for the moſt part of the others leavings, ſeeketh by all means poſſible to ſell in corners, and to ſhut out the Sun, that it be not well ſeen, or to give you a ſight thereof by falſe lights only; neither will he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver you the whole piece into your hand, to be examined throughly by your ſelf, but ſheweth you one end thereof only, different from the reſt which he ſuppreſſeth. And this manner of proceeding ſhall you find verified on their ſide throughout this whoſe Treatiſe, as we have done already, I doubt not, if you have read it over with attention; yet mean I in this place to diſcover the ſame ſomewhat more in particular, for an upſhot and concluſion of theſe firſt two parts of my Treatiſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

For we ſay with S. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> when any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty falleth out, <hi>Quiſquis falli metuit hujus obſcuritate quaeſtionis, Eccleſiam de illa conſulat; Whoſoever doth fear to be deceived by the obſcurity of this Queſtion in controverſie, let him go to the Church for his Reſolution, and he ſhall be ſecure.</hi>

               <p n="5">5. Thus wrote <hi>Lactantius</hi> 1300 years ago, and addeth preſently theſe words following, whereby he well ſheweth the conformity of ſpirit of thoſe old Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics with ours at this day:<note place="margin">Lactant. ibid.</note>

               <p n="6">6. St.<hi>Cyprian,</hi> that lived more than Sixty years before <hi>Lactantius,</hi> maketh the very ſame account with him and us, that all is loſt, if we loſe or miſs this Church:<note place="margin">Cyp. l. de ſimpl. Praelat.</note>

               </p>
               <p n="7">7. And finally, not to go from the forenamed holy Man St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> in this behalf, who died for the defence of Chriſt's Faith, and the true Catholic Church,<note place="margin">No man can be ſaved out of the true Church.</note> and is a moſt bleſſed Martyr and Doctor to us all, he after a long Diſcourſe made touching a Chriſtian Man that miſſeth in this Point of finding out and following the true Catholic Church, and yet in other things endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voureth to live well, and ſheweth great Zeal in God's Cauſe, and deſireth in his Mind even to die for the ſame, of this Man he pronounceth this Sentence, <hi>Nunquam perveniet ad Chriſti praemia,</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="8">8. Thus ſaid St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> as alſo all ancient holy Fathers after him, whereof I might alledge many Authorities, if it were not over long; and the ſame ſay we that are Catholics, and do hold the ſame Faith and Church with them at this day.<note place="margin">How much it importeth each man to conſider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be in the true Ch. or not.</note> We do hold (I ſay) that the firſt and principal Point of all other for a Chriſtian Man, that meaneth his own Salvation, is to ſeek out the true Catholic Church, and to conſider whether he be of it, or in it, or no: For if he be not, then all other diligence and labor is void and in vain, except it be to ſeek out this; and if he be in it, then is he in the right way of Salvation; not for that all be ſaved who are within her, (as in the ſecond Point ſhall be ſhewed) but for that all thoſe who are out of her, ſhall be certainly damned, as now you have heard out of the chiefeſt Fathers of the ancient Catholic Church. And this is the firſt Point of ſingular moment, for which we eſteem this Church ſo highly, for that no Salvation can be had without her.</p>
               <p n="9">
                  <pb n="217" facs="tcp:104638:119"/>9. But Secondly,<note place="margin">The benefits by being in the Church.</note> we eſteem alſo the importance of this matter by the great and excellent helps which in this Church above all other Congregations, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Men have to procure their Salvation, tho' all do not uſe the ſame to their beſt benefit, and thereby do miſcarry. For to come to ſome particulars, we ſay, That in this Church, and no where elſe, is the truth of Faith, and certainty thereof,<note place="margin">Marc. ultim.</note> and this by the perpetual aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt promiſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto by the Founder, God himſelf.<note place="margin">Mat. <hi>18.</hi>
                  </note> In this Church is the infallible Judgment both about the Books of Scripture and their Interpretation, as all other Doubts and Controverſies, according to that you have heard before out of S. <hi>Auguſtin.</hi> In this Church alone, and no where elſe, is there true Prieſthood by lawful Succeſſion, Unction, and Impoſition of Hands,<note place="margin">Joan. <hi>20.</hi>
                  </note> and conſequently Remiſſion alſo of Sins by the Authority they have from Chriſt to that effect. In this Church is the true number, uſe, and force of holy Sacraments, and Grace given by them. In this Church is Unity of Faith and Doctrin, Communion of Saints, and of Merits and Prayers, which no where elſe is to be found. And finally, in this Church alone is there warrant and ſecurity from Error, aſſurance from over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, failing, or fading; which ſecurity is eſtabliſhed by the promiſe of Chriſt himſelf, as our God Creator and Redeemer, and to endure unto the worlds end.</p>
               <p n="10">10. All theſe utilities and moſt ſingular benefits do we believe to be in this Catholic Church, above all other Congregations in the world. In reſpect whereof we hold this Church to be our ſhip, our rock, our caſtle, our fortreſs, our miſtreſs, our mother, our skilful pilot throughout all ſtorms of hereſies, our pillar and firmament of truth againſt falſhood, our houſe of refuge againſt tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation, our protection, our direction, our help, aid, and ſecurity in all points; and if any man periſh in her, it is by his own default; but out of her none can but periſh. And this is our eſtimation of this Affair.</p>
               <p n="11">11. But now how different an account Proteſtants do make both of this, or their own Church, is eaſily ſeen by their own words and doings: For <note n="a" place="margin">The contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptibility of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants Church even among themſelves.</note> as they contemn and impugn our Church, which we hold for the only true, ſo do they ſeldom ſpeak of their own. For when ſhall you hear a Miniſter or Proteſtant Writer, allege the Authority of his Church againſt us, or againſt his own Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, when they fall out (as often they do) or if he ſhould, how lightly is it eſteemed even by themſelves?

                  <note place="margin">What <hi>John Fox</hi> taketh from his Church.</note> and thereby doth take from the true Church (and conſequently in his meaning, from his own) all this excellent Authority which S. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> and other Fathers do aſcribe to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic Church, to wit the Sovereignty of approving or rejecting true or falſe Scriptures, of diſcerning between Books and Books, and judging of their true interpretations; and ſeeing further he taketh away from his Church both Confeſſion and Abſolution of ſins, and all efficacy of Sacraments, leaving them only to bare Signs, that do ſignifie and not work, ſeeing he taketh away from her all infallibility of Doctrin, confeſſing that ſhe may err, and contenteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that ſhe retain ever ſome ſparkles only of true Doctrin and Religion, as before hath been ſhewed out of his own words; and conſidering moreover, that he maketh her ſo poor a thing as now you have ſeen, and furniſheth her with ſuch rags, to wit, with ſuch variety of Sectaries as is ridiculous to name, they diſagreeing among themſelves, and the one moſt oppoſite to the other in Doctrin and Belief, ſhe being ſuch a Church (I ſay) ſo poor and miſerable,<note place="margin">The Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants believe the Devil as much as their own Church.</note> ſo obſcure and ragged, ſo doubtful and uncertain, no marvail tho' they make little account of her, or give ſmall credit unto her, which in very deed is no greater than is given to the worſt man, or moſt diſhoneſt woman living, which is to believe her ſo far, as ſhe can prove by others what ſhe ſaith to be true, to wit, by Scriptures, without which witneſs none of her own children or houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold will credit or believe her; which is a remarkable Point, for that with the ſame condition they will believe the Devil himſelf, and muſt do, if he allege Scriptures in the true ſenſe and meaning.</p>
               <p n="17">17. And this is the eſtimation which Proteſtants do hold of their new Church. Now let us paſs to ſpeak a word only about the ſecond Point,<note place="margin">The ſecond principal point wherein Catholics and Proteſtants do differ.</note> which concerneth the aſſigning out, or deſcription of this Church. Clear it is, and cannot be denied, that Catholics do aſſign ſuch a Church as may be ſeen and known by all men, begun viſibly by Chriſt himſelf in <hi>Jury,</hi> when he gathered his Apoſtles and Diſciples together, and continued afterward with infinite in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of Nations and People, Countries and Kingdoms, that in tract of time adjoyned themſelves thereunto, and that this moſt manifeſt, notorious and known Church, hath endured ever ſince under the name of the Chriſtian Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic Church, for the ſpace of ſixteen hundred years, as we have ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both largely and particularly in the former Treatiſe, which is plain deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, clear and manifeſt; whereas on the other ſide, the Proteſtants of our days following herein the ſteps of old Heretics their Anceſtors, do ſeek to aſſign ſuch a Church, as no man can tell where to find it; for that it is rather imaginary, mathematical, or metaphyſical, than ſenſible to man's eyes, conſiſting (as they teach) of juſt and predeſtinate men only, whom, where, or how to find, you ſee how uncertain and difficult a thing it is, in this mortal life.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Wherefore as the ancient Fathers condemned wholly the Heretics of their times, for this fond and pernicious device, and wrote eagerly againſt the ſame, as S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> againſt the <hi>Novatians,</hi> S. <hi>Epiphanius,</hi>

And for that this may be ſufficient for a taſt, to ſhew the different man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of proceeding between Catholics and Heretics, both old and new, about this Point of aſſigning out the true Church, where, and in whom it is, and how to be found;<note place="margin">The third principal dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference about the proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties &amp; marks of the true Church.</note> I ſhall paſs no farther in this matter, but only add a word or two of the third Point, which is the difference between us in laying forth the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties and notes, whereby this Church may be known and diſtinguiſhed from all others; which Point, tho' it may ſufficiently be ſeen and gathered by that which already we have ſaid, yet for promiſe ſake muſt ſomewhat alſo be ſpoken here; which in effect ſhall be nothing but this, That the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us and the Proteſtants in delivering theſe proprieties, is not far unlike to that of two Gentlemen, that ſhould ſend forth two Servants into the Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place,<note place="margin">A Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent giving of notes to find a thing by.</note> where many Men are to ſeek out ſome Learned Phyſician, (for Examples ſake) giving them certain notes to find him by, but far different; for that the one delivereth either general notes only, that are common to all, or moſt Men; as that he hath a head, beard, two eyes, two arms, and the like; or elſe certain inward inviſible proprieties; as that he is learned, meek, chaſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That he is a good Phyſician, cureth excellently well, and followeth therein exactly the Precepts of <hi>Hypocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen;</hi> and finally, hath all things neceſſary or need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for that effect. Which marks being little to the purpoſe, as you ſee, for knowing or diſcerning out the ſaid Phyſician from any other, the Meſſenger might weary himſelf, before he found that which he ſought for.</p>
               <p n="27">27. But the other that ſendeth forth his Meſſenger, conſidering that marks and ſigns muſt be more known than the thing it ſelf, whereof they are marks, and not common to many, but proper and peculiar to that which is ſought for; telleth his Servant, what ſpecial Name the Phyſician is called by, what age, what countenance, and what ſtature he is of, what apparel he weareth, what geſture and manner of going he uſeth, what ſound of voice he hath in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and above all where he dwelleth, how his houſe may be found, known and diſcerned from all others: All which ſigns being given, we muſt needs ſay, that the Searcher is a very ſimple or negligent Fellow if he miſs him.</p>
               <p n="28">28. And this very difference is to be noted between the Proteſtants and us in delivering proprieties to know the Church by, for that the Catholics give ſound and ſure notes, proper and peculiar to one only Church, which is the true Catholic Church, and theſe notes not invented by themſelves, but found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Scriptures, and delivered by the Tradition of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and uſed by the ancient Fathers and Doctors of the Church, to this very purpoſe of diſtinguiſhing her thereby from all Congregations and Conventicles of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retics whatſoever:<note place="margin">Proprieties and Marks the true Church given by Catholics.</note> Of which notes and proprieties you have heard ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, mentioned in the Conference between S. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> and the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> as the Name <hi>Catholic</hi> and the ancient poſſeſſion thereof; Univerſality over all Chriſtendom, and multitude of Nations and Gentiles converted to one Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church and Faith, participating, and holding the Communion of one and the ſelf-ſame number of Sacraments: whereunto are added by other Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and the ſelf-ſame Doctor in other places, divers, other proprieties alſo, as antiquity with continuation and ſucceſſion from age to age, viſibility with moſt perſpicuous and illuſtrious progreſs, apparent and admirable to the whole world; unity and conformity in Doctrin by one Rule of Faith throughout all ages; notorious ſanctity in many members of this Church teſtified by infinite miracles, and ſupernatural operations; the converſion of infinite Pagans and Gentiles, with overthrow and extirpation of their Idolatry, which was a thing propheſied to be fulfilled by the true Church only.</p>
               <p n="29">29. Theſe notes (I ſay) and divers others are ſet down by holy Fathers, as both proper and peculiar to the only true Catholic Church of Chriſt, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing to no Heretical Congregation whatſoever; as alſo manifeſt and noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:104638:122"/>
and moſt eaſie to be judged of by all people. For theſe two conditions ought to have true marks, as before hath been mentioned; the firſt, that they be peculiar and not common; the ſecond, that they be more notoriouſly known, and more eaſily found out, than the thing it ſelf which they do demonſtrate: whereof you may read in particular in S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> againſt the <hi>Novatians,</hi> S. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi> againſt the <hi>Luciferians,</hi> S. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> againſt the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> and <hi>Pelagians, Optatus</hi> againſt the ſame <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> and <hi>Vincentius Lyrinenſis</hi> againſt all ſorts of Heretics; and this is the real and ſubſtantial dealing of Catholics.</p>
               <p n="30">30. But the Proteſtants on the contrary ſide do give ſuch marks and notes as are either general and common, or elſe more obſcure and harder to be found out and judged of, than the matter in controverſie, as before we have ſignified, by the Compariſons of ſeeking out the Phyſician; as for Example,<note place="margin">Luth. lib. de conc. parte ult.</note> 
                  <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> Father of our Proteſtants, having left the Communion of the true Church of God, and made a new Conventicle to himſelf, would needs make it the true Church of God, and prove the ſame by certain marks and proprieties deviſed by himſelf, which he ſetteth down to the number of Seven;<note place="margin">The marks of the Church fondly ſet down by He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retics.</note> whereof the firſt was, the true Preaching of the Goſpel; the ſecond, the right Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Baptiſm; the third, the lawful uſe of the Euchariſt; the fourth, the due Exerciſe of the Eccleſiaſtical Keys in Abſolving and retaining Sins; the fifth, the lawful Election of Miniſters; the ſixth, publick Prayer, and Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Pſalms in a known Tongue; the ſeventh, the Myſtery of the Croſs in bearing tribulations.

                  </note> do abridge to the number of two only, to wit, the true Preaching of the Goſpel, and the ſincere uſe of Sacraments.</p>
               <p n="31">31. But now what manner of notes theſe be, which every Sect may and do challenge as proper to themſelves, (which they cannot do with any probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, with the marks and notes of the Catholic Church before ſet down) is eaſie to judge; for what Sect will not ſay and ſwear alſo, if need be, that they only Preach the Word of God truly, and that they only Adminiſter the Sacraments rightly, and that they uſe the Eccleſiaſtical Keys duly, and that the Election of Miniſters is lawfully made among them, and that they have publick Prayer and ſinging of Pſalms, bearing the Croſs, and the like? and it is harder to convince them in any one of theſe notes, than in the principal point it ſelf, to wit, that they are not the Catholic Chriſtian Church of Chriſt; ſo as theſe marks being common, and not proper, and leſs manifeſt than the thing it ſelf, whereof they are put for marks, it followeth that they are fond, vain and ridiculous, and that the inventors thereof did rather ſeek to obſcure and hide the Church, than to declare, and manifeſt the ſame by ſuch proprieties.</p>

bring to paſs that the Conference ſhould not be made, nor the Cauſe it ſelf be handled at all; but when they could not obtain this, then went they about to put down ſo many things in writing as they might not eaſily be read.</hi>
