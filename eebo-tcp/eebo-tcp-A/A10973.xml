            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <salute>Right reuerend:</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a most true and memorable saying of that ancient, eloquent &amp; learned Father, <hi>Saluianus,</hi> B. of Massilia, that to fal into the error of a false opinion (though ignorantly) before a man doth know the truth, is a token of a mind rude and simple: but to perseuere in error after one hath bin told and admonished of the same, is an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of a pertinacious &amp; froward disposition. So S. <hi>Augustine: Aliquid aliter sapere,</hi> to relish a thing otherwise then it is, is an humane tentation (and infirmitie,) but for a man too much to be inamored with his owne conceit, or enuying his betters to come vnto the sacriledge euen of renting asunder the communion (of the Church) and of erecting of schisme, or heresie, it is diabolical pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption. And yet this frowardnes or pertinacy, or diuellish pride and presumption is so ingraffed in the hearts of most men (as <hi>Eras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> hath obserued, and experience doth proue vnto vs) as what
<pb facs="tcp:16597:3"/>
once they haue apprehended, they will euer hold; and what they haue published, they will not reuoke, be it neuer so offensiue, and in their owne conscience, erroneous, and vntrue. <hi>Erasmus</hi> doth well note, how most natures be stiffe in maintenance of their singular and selfe conceited fantasies. God be thanked, all men be not so. For of all professions, sects, and sorts of men (euen from the beginning, since learning, and wisedome by writing or bookes hath bin made knowne and obuious) there haue neuer bin wanting some, who haue bin inspired with such grace and good motions, as that they haue very ingenuously acknowledged their scapes, and willingly submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto the trueth, when it hath bin reuealed vnto them, howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer afore they were otherwise minded, and aduersaries thereunto. So did <hi>Quintilian,</hi> yea and <hi>Tullie</hi> too afore him change their iudgements in points of Rhetoricke; so did <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> that so renowned Physition in matters of Physick; so <hi>Cornelius Agrippa</hi> about his hidden Philosophy. <hi>Orpheus,</hi> that Polytheian sang a palinodie, acknowledging one God at the length, who defended a multitude of Gods at the first: and S. <hi>Augustine</hi> too, when his gray haires were growen, most conscionably, and to his eternall fame and honor, very wisely corrected, and retracted, what in his greene yeres in considerately he had broched.</p>
                  <p>Neither in the times long past onely, but in this latter age also of the world, wherein we liue, haue such good spirits appeared. <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus Gaza</hi> (for learning a rare man, &amp; almost peerelesse) had his proper and peculiar errors, which when he saw, he was not ashamed to reuoke them, and to alter his iudgement vpon the admonition of <hi>Trapezuntius.</hi> Yea, and <hi>Theodorus Beza</hi> (no meane man nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his time) as he was not without his faults, so had he not the face to iustifie, or stand stiffe in them, but very Christianly, and as one studious to keepe a good conscience both before God and man, grewe into an vtter detestation of, and amended them, (<note n="*" place="margin">Quiquid offendere po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuit, damnaui, sustuli, iugula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ui<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>saith Beza himselfe in his def<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> against Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nebrards accus.</hi>
                     </note>) with points too of doctrine that gaue offence, as our <hi>Whitakers</hi> doth say.
<pb facs="tcp:16597:3"/>
Of whose mind had <hi>Heliodorus,</hi> Bishop somtime of Trice, bin when it was, he had comfortably enioyed still a faire and fat Bishopricke, which fondly hee did forgoe, because he would not consent to the burning of certaine amorous and prophane inuentions, penned by the said <hi>Heliodorus</hi> in his youth, but for their vilenes, by an whole Synod, or Conuocation of Bishops, and other clergy men condemned to the fire, as <hi>Nicephorus</hi> doth record. I spare to speake of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Melancton, Caluin,</hi> and other learned men neither few, nor of meane account among all reformed Churches, and people, who preferring Gods glory before popular praise, haue satisfied good men, and made publike amends for some things vnaduisedly pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished.</p>
                  <p>Neither haue there bin wanting some such among our selues, God be thanked. Ah gentlemen (saith a late writer in this kingdome) that liue to read my broken and confused lines, looke not that I should (as I was wont) delight you with vaine fantasies; but gather my follies together, and, as you would deale with so many paricides, cast them into the fire; call them <hi>Telegones,</hi> for now they kill their Father, and euery line in them written is a deepe piercing wound to mine heart: euery idle houre spent by any in reading them; brings a million of sorrowes to my soule. O that the teares of a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable man (for neuer man was more miserable) might wash their memory out with my death! But sith they cannot, let this my last worke witnesse against them with me, how I detest them. Blacke is the remembrance of my blacke workes, blacker then night, blacker then death, blacker then hell. So he; and euen in these very words: which would both Gentle, and all men well consider of and ponder, neither should the Presse, and Stationers shops be abused as they are, inuenting such bookes (to the high dishonour of God, and discredite of our Churches discipline:) nor men and women, leauing better things, addict themselues so greedily to the perusall, if not studie of vanities, which bring no good, but woful repentance in the end. The
<pb facs="tcp:16597:4"/>
man which this vttered was himselfe a good Scholar, but (euen as his very words doe import) a very vaine and vicious man: yet euen such persons with Publicans and Harlots sometimes doe repent, and to the great ioy of the holy Angels enter into the kingdome of heauen, as doe Schismatikes also now and then, but rarely yet, and as hardly as doe rich men into the celestiall paradise.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bolton</hi> (that first broched among vs those opinions, which <hi>Browne</hi> afterward and his followers embraced as heauenly Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles) he saw his error at the last, was ashamed of them and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: but how? wanting grace to confesse so much before God and his Church, like another Iudas he hung himselfe, and so desperately finished his daies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Coppinger</hi> (that new prophet, and copartner in <hi>Hackets</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracie for pretended reformation) he had a sight too of his errors and follies at the length, and an insight also into the truth, yea and after a sort repented; but being destitute of grace to retract his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and not able to abide the terrors of a troubled and guiltie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, he famished himselfe to death, as the storie of him doeth report.</p>
                  <p>On the other side, <hi>Arthington</hi> his example is memorable, he was vexed and pursued with the inward and most heauy iudgements of God vpon his soule, so long as he tooke <hi>Hacket</hi> (cursed <hi>Hacket</hi>) to be his soueraigne King and Sauiour: but he no sooner saw his errors, fell into a loathing of them, and made his recantation and reuocation of them, but hee found much peace and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in his soule, to his euerlasting welfare (as himselfe confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth in his booke therof vnto the Lords of the late Queens Counsel)</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Clapham</hi> (that out of England went first into the Low-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; afterwards into Scotland; after that againe into ihe Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countries; then againe into Scotland; and once more into the Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countries, and all about the controuersies betweene the Brownists and vs) had a restlesse and perplexed mind, and could neuer be
<pb facs="tcp:16597:4"/>
quiet till he fell into a detestation of Brownisme, and their founders the disciplinarians, whom before he highly accounted of, and had both returned home, and reconciled himselfe wholly vnto the Church of England, from which he had estraied, as his Antido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum doth witnesse.</p>
                  <p>Such another was <hi>Pet. Faire-lambe</hi> (as arrant a Brownist as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer liued, &amp; one that for the propagating of that cursed sect, had tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed Sea and Land, tossed in bodie, troubled in mind) neuer quiet and at rest til God opened his eies, as he did <hi>Sauls,</hi> that he might see, and giuen him power to embrace the truth; yea, and to testifie the same by his publique Recantation, extant and in Print, before God and the world.</p>
                  <p>I am of mind (my good Lord) that there be among vs not a few of the Sectaries of al sorts, which with <hi>Bolton</hi> and <hi>Coppinger</hi> do see their grosse ouer-sights and errors in the points controuerted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them and vs; but few there be which with <hi>Arthington, Clapham, and Faire-lambe</hi> haue the face and grace to confesse them to the world, deeming diabolical pertinacy to bee godly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy. Therfore that this their frowardnes may appere, euen as it is, both diuellish and hellish, I haue set downe (best knowne to your wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome) the examples premised of persons, wherof all &amp; euery of them haue both openly retracted, yea and by permanent monuments com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended vnto the ages succeeding the reuocation of their slips, and consent vnto the truth, in which their doing they haue purchased to themselues no discredite at all, but a very honest reputation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all good and wise men.</p>
                  <p>But all men haue not grace, yea of them which haue it, few haue the power openly, and vnder their owne hands to reclame and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract that which erroneously they once haue held. And surely thogh it be necessary that all and euery one which goeth astray from the truth, do repent, and leaue his wicked opinions: yet that men should testifie their conuersion and comming home againe, after one and
<pb facs="tcp:16597:5"/>
the same fashion, it is not necessary and vrgeable.</p>
                  <p>And therefore doe I commend mine Antagonist sometime, M. <hi>Seffray,</hi> who though he disliked, yea and depraued our Kneeling at the holy Communion, asmuch as any man could do (witnesse his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections following) chusing rather both to abide the censure of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, yea and to be without the comforts, which they participate that with one heart and mind, brotherly and orderly come vnto the table of the Lord, then so much as to bend his knees at the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that most blessed and heauenly Sacrament: yet notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after friendly and brotherly conference had with him therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, altered his mind, allowing that which before hee condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. He hath not the power (weake man) either to thanke him, who after God hath opened his eies, or publikely to disclaime his errors: but he hath the grace for to abhorre them as monsters: and so much hath testified by his late orderly, and submissiue kneeling in the very act of receiuing the sacred bread and wine at the Communion the last Easter, in the place of his now most vsual abiding. A worthy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantation not verbal to be heard, but real to be seene, or heard of: which I praise God for, and pray that he may doe the like in other things ceremoniall; which had he performed, he had still enioyed a sweete and competent liuing (to the singular refreshing of many a Christian soule, hauing a very good gift in preaching: and to the temporall benefiting of himselfe and his) which he hath forgone, (as the forementioned <hi>Heliodorus</hi> did his Bishopricke) chusing rather to leaue it, then to condemne his vanities.</p>
                  <p>Whose example (not in obstinate maintaining that which is erroneous and ill, but in yeelding vnto the truth discouered) if the other man (whose printed Pamphlet, or Proposition (accompanied, as himselfe thinketh, with arguments impregnable; as will appeare with vntruths, blasphemies, and impieties intollerable) about the foresaid Kneeling at the Communion, I haue here answered, and confuted) will follow, I shall thinke my paines very well imployed;
<pb facs="tcp:16597:5"/>
if not, yet shall the world see and perceiue the difference betweene a man simplie and ignorantly erring, and a peruerted and froward Schismatike; they being willing to heare and learne; the other stopping his eares, and hardening his heart against the truth: the one flexible, the other incorrgible: the one of ill becomming good; the other of bad prouing worse, of a Schismatike at the first, an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retike at the last. For no better shall I esteeme him if he hold on; and the end of Schisme is Heresie, if not Atheisme. His cause is the very same, and none other then M. <hi>Seffrais</hi> was; his reasons the same too in effect, though moe for number, yet not stronger in force. If therefore the said <hi>Seffray</hi> doth find in his iudgement the truth to be with me (which is stronger then both, and what either they haue broched, or any man can obiect against the same,) and thereupon hath yeelded, and resigned himselfe thereunto, there is no cause the other man, whosoeuer he be, should frowardly and fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly standout. Reasons ought, but if they will not, let this example moue him to conforme.</p>
                  <p>The former of these Conferences hath beene performed (as the truth is) both by mouth and pen: by mouth, authority nominating me therunto, and M. <hi>Seffray</hi> calling for the same at my hands; and was had at mine owne dwelling house in Suffolke the last Haruest: by pen, at the desire of the said <hi>Seffray</hi> immediatly after our spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and that not onely for himselfe (and peraduenture for others too of the Brother-hood) better to consider of, but also for the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of him besides, who both motioned the same at the first, and desired it might be written for a further good.</p>
                  <p>And being committed to writing had so continued priuate in few mens hands (for any thing that was in my thought (God hee knoweth) touching the publication of the same) had not some persons (neere and deere vnto your Lordshippe: and for their vertues, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and iudgement, of more then ordinary account in our Church and State) vpon reasons both speciall and vrgent, very earnestly
<pb facs="tcp:16597:6"/>
moued me to make the same more common.</p>
                  <p>The other was occasioned by a certaine printed Libell, of not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue two sheetes of paper (of which bulke, or thereabouts, myselfe haue seene diuers treatises published by the Sectaries, An. 1605. and so made purposely, they knowing, and foreseeing, that bookes of that size, and of small price, are both more readily bought vp on all hands, especially of the common people, whose fauour they hunt and hawke after; &amp; more greedily read, &amp; more easily vnderstood, then large, tedious, and deere discourses) published I wot not by whom, <note n="*" place="margin">Neither must any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after him, or gesse who he was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Pref. to the propos.</note> and printed I know not where, but doubtlesse beyond the Sea (for the Printer wanted an English Corrector:) but wheresoeuer, and by whomsoeuer printed and published (which for my part I shall not be curious to inquire after, as the publisher would not haue any man to be,) I haue thought it my bounden duety to answere and confute the same, both because it is of the same verie subiect which the former is, namely, against kneeling at the communion, as against flat Idolatrie; as also for that the same is purposely diuulged, both to harden such persons among vs (whereof the number is but too greate) in their folly, as imbrace and hold that errour, and to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure so many of our Church as possibly may be, to be of that opinion.</p>
                  <p>And therefore both for the further and fuller manifestation of the truth by answering what the aduersaries hitherto haue deuised, and dispersed as well in papers priuately, as publiquely in print, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the said Kneeling, for the vpholding of Schisme, and faction in that point; and likewise for the preseruation of many in the peace and vnity of our Church, and deliuery of others (so far as in me lieth) from this foule, and lothsome opinion; I haue thought it expedient, yea very necessary, the times considered, to vndertake this labour.</p>
                  <p>Whereby whatsoeuer the author of the said Libel hath obiected, is both answered and confuted; and what he hath written, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballie, and syllabicallie, (the order of a dialogue onely considered,
<pb facs="tcp:16597:6"/>
and obserued) yea and without omitting so much as a letter, set downe. This I speake of the booke it selfe. For as touching the Preface, it being partlie slanderous and reprochfull, partly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticing all sorts of people vnto an open rupture, schisme, and forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of our Communions, because of the said Kneeling, I haue not medled therewithall, being for my part of all other men both most vnwilling to spend good and pretious houres about such matter, as cannot be stirred without offending the eares and stomackes of good men; and most hartilie sorie that any men, pretending sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie (as all Schismatikes doe) should either employ their pennes, or thinke that euen their cause can be blessed of the highest, which hath no better meanes then lies, slanders, diffamations, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoning the Vnion and Communion of Gods people, to vphold and support itselfe withall.</p>
                  <p>Now these my labours I verie humblie desire your Lordship to accept at the hands of an old Oxford, and Christ-church man (to whom it is no small ioy and comfort, that he liueth to see that Vniuersitie equall at least with any other place of Learning in the word, famouslie, and admirablie to flourish; and of that Vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie to obserue men of Christ-church, for their rare and singular endowments, to be of such note and regard with the King, and State, as that the gouernment of foure chiefe and eminent places, and Dioceses in this land, is at this present, committed to their trust and inspection, as most worthy Patrons and pillars for the supporting both of the vncorrupt doctrine, and holy discipline in this Church established.) And though I doubt not, but I am knowne vnto all your Honours in some sort, being sometime a poore member with you all, at one and the same time, of one and the same Colledge, or Cathedrall Church: yet doe I acknowledge this, and what els I am able to performe due vnto your Lordship more then vnto any other man, partly for that which it hath pleased you of late to write both vnto mee, and touching me in your letters
<pb facs="tcp:16597:7"/>
vnto that all worthie, M. D. <hi>Tinley,</hi> Arch-deacon of Elie (my right worshipfull good friend) which I haue both seene, and read, and with a thankefull minde recognise; partly for that which it hath pleased your Lordship to say &amp; vtter vnto my selfe, since my comming vnto London; and especially because you haue vouchsafed to testifie your well liking of what I haue done, both by a more then ordinarie approbation, and desire that it might come abroad, and also by commending of the same vnto the presse, for the furtherance of the worke, and better publishing it vnto the world. Acknowledging therefore these your manifold vndeser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued fauours with a very thankefull heart, and promising my best to deserue them, I earst and againe very humbly desire your good Lordship to accept these treatises with the former, and same af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections at my poore hands, in respect of my owne handling, simple and slender bee they I confesse, but for their subiect, and these times of Schisme (wherein many writers, and spreaders of new and false doctrines may be seene, but few confuters of them; many disturbers of our Church, and vnderminers of the peace, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speritie thereof by factious and Schismaticall discourses, but few counterminers, or that stand in the breach, to keepe these aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries out of the Citie of God, and from the sheep-fold of Christ) very necessarie, and worthie your Lordships patronage and protection: and so very humbly taketh his leaue, the fourth of May, Anno. 1608.</p>

                        <p>That is not simplie and absolutely true. For in the administration of the Lords Supper we are to imitate Christ, but onely in things necessarie, not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessorie; and substantiall, not circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall, and accidentall.</p>
                        <p>Christ is to be followed of vs, not as he was God, but as he was man; and as man in his Morall euer, not alwayes in his Ministeriall actions.</p>
                        <p>Our Sauiour willeth vs in the celebration of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the deliuerie of bread, and wine, to renue the memorie of his death and passion till he returne againe<note n="a" place="margin">Luke 22. 19.</note>, but not to vse his, or the Apostles gestures at the deliuerie of the
<pb facs="tcp:16597:8"/>
elements. Hence the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> did alter some things which our Sauiour did, in the administration of the Lords Supper, promising also at his returne to set other things in order<note n="b" place="margin">1. Cor. 11. 34.</note>, which Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> vnderstandeth of the same forme, and maner of ministring the same, which is now ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued in our Churches reformed<note n="c" place="margin">D. August. Epist. 118.</note>.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, if herein we be necessarily tied to the example of Christ, then are we to minister this Sacrament, not (as wee doe now) in the publique Church, but in a priuate house, not in the morning, but in the night: not after dinner, but after supper: not vnto women, but onely vnto men, and those Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters too of the word. For all this did Christ, and we doe not, and yet herein doe nothing against the will of God.</p>

                        <p>Christ performed this action sitting. <hi>Mat. 26. 20. Mar. 14. 18. Luke 22. 14. Iohn. 13. 12.</hi>

                        <p>Meane you that the people should stand, and the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister sit, because Christ performed this action sitting? Or would you haue both Minister and people to sit, when the Sacrament is to bee administred, because Christ performed this action sitting? What your meaning may be, when you say, Christ performed this action sitting, is verie doubtfull and vncertaine.</p>
                        <p>If you would haue the people to stand, and the Minister to sit, because Christ performed this action sitting, you aske more then I euer yet heard demanded. If you would haue the people to sit, and the Minister to stand, you swarue from the imitation of Christ, who performed this action sitting. If you would that both Minister and people should sit, because Christ performed this action sitting, though you haue some few Churches concurring with you in your desires: yet are you nothing neare the example of Christ, which you would bind vs vnto. For Christ did not performe this action
<pb facs="tcp:16597:8"/>
(after our maner) sitting. If you will imitate Christ in this action, then must you lie downe on little pillowes at the table, as he and his Disciples did<note n="d" place="margin">See Caluin, Beza, Vileri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua, yea and the Geneua Bible annot<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>That is no good consequent, no more then this, that we must in the supper vse thinne broad vnleauened cakes, or loaues, because Christ did so.</p>

                        <speaker>R.</speaker>
                        <p>The maner of our Countrie is to receiue our corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall food sitting; the order of our Church, that wee receiue the spirituall foode of our soules at the Communion knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. It is as vndecent a thing in mine eie, in the publique Church, to receiue the food of our soules at the Lords table, sitting; as it is in our owne hall and houses to take our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall meate, kneeling.</p>
                        <p>It was in our Sauiour his choice, to administer it lying, sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, kneeling, and how he thought good: but it is not in our election (that be either Ministers or people) how we wil mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, or take the same. For it ought by our Lawes, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to be receiued kneeling; neither doth it suffice (in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of Church policie) that we sit.</p>
                        <p>The vsuall maner of our Countrie is, not onely to sit, but to be couered also, when we are at our meate: ought wee therefore to haue our heads couered, when wee are at the Lords Table? you may as well say this, as affirme the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

                           <pb facs="tcp:16597:9"/>Wherefore I denie not your consequent (as perhaps you deeme I will) but say (as earst I did) that wee are no more bound to our Sauiour his Sitting (if he did sit, as he did not) then we are tied to celebrate the Lords Supper in the Eue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning in a priuate house, to Men, and those Ecclesiasticall Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, and neither to women, nor to the laitie.</p>

                        <p>There is a reason of the change of those circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as those which were incident properly to the first insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, which was immediatly to succeed the last Passeouer, which Passeouer was to be eaten in the Euening, in a priuate family, being sufficient for a Lambe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 3, 4, 5. 6, 7, 8. Now it tendeth to edification to celebrate the Supper in the day, and openly in the Congregation, consisting of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, both men and women; and therefore the Church hath done well in changing these circumstances, according to the precept of the Apostle. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 26.</p>

                        <p>You crosse not me at al, but display still the vnsoundnes of your first assertion. The Church after Christ both well might, &amp; lawfully did, both adde &amp; alter many things in the forme, and maner of administration of the Lords Supper, which our Sauiour either purposely omitted, or left to her determination.</p>

                        <p>Changing of sitting? You cannot say, and prooue, that Christ sate as we doe, at his last supper, but otherwise you haue said.</p>
                        <p>But did he sit, why may not the same his sitting, by his Church be changed into kneeling, as well as other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances by you repeated? And what preheminence hath Sitting aboue Kneeling, that it may, and must be vsed at the Communion, and not that? what reason haue you to the

                        <p>O (<hi>M.

                        <p>Would we not so quickly resolue and conclude what is better and best; fitter, and fittest in these matters, it would goe better with vs, and the whole Church too, then alas it doeth.</p>
                        <p>Yet to tell you what I thinke, though Sitting as we vse to sit at our common feastings, is both comely, and commen dable: yet so to Sit at the Communion, carrieth not that shew of humble reuerence vnto the al-holy God, as Knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling doth. But to Lie, or Leane, or (if you will) to Sit at the Lords Table, as our Sauiour, and his Disciples did, were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie vnseemly, and vndecent among vs.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:16597:10"/>
which the custome both of those times, and of their country made common, and vsuall (your selfe hath confessed.) And therfore both he and they did that which was both ciuill and comely.</p>
                        <p>Againe, our Sauiour might do that surpassingly wel, which we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not. Any action beseemed his person, because without sin. He graced all his gestures, no gesture graced him. But we (alas!) we are sinfull wretches, repairing vnto the Lords boord, partly like supplicants, humbly suing for the remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of our sinnes; &amp; partly to shew our thankfulnesse for the comforts and benefites we haue receiued, and hope to bee partakers of through Christ. And therefore haue iust cause euen most humbly to kneele, as we do.</p>

Thus one euill thought bringeth another. Take heede of them in time, else bring you to worse.</p>
                        <p>Besides, this assertion is as voide of reason among men, as it is of truth in religion. For as to Kneele at the holy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is no Idolatrie, nor so much as apparance thereof in sound Diuinitie: so is Kneeling not in the predicament of substance, but of <hi>Site.</hi> And therefore <hi>no Monument</hi> by the rule of reason.</p>
                        <p>But be it a <hi>Momument,</hi> is our kneeling a Monument of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie? Kneeling at the Masse is grosse, and palpable Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie. Is therefore kneeling also at the Communion a Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Idolatrie?</p>
                        <p>Last of al, let Kneeling be of neuer so impious and detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vse among Papists: yet is the same gesture of good &amp; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie vse in our church. For hereby (as by the seemliest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauior for so religious a seruice,) we testifie the earnest, and most zealous deuotion of our souls, when we do either pray, or praise God, as we do both at the receiuing the sacrament.</p>
                        <p>So that, were it a Monument of Idolatrie (as it is nothing lesse) deuised by man: yet because it is of so good and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie vse in our seruice of God, euen in your owne iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and conscience, and that from these your words, it is not to be remoued.</p>

                        <p>Till I know your consequent, this shall be my answer vnto the Antecedent; how our Sauiour speaketh (<hi>Mat.</hi> 18, <hi>&amp; seq.</hi>) of such defaults, as whereby other men, either by erroneous doctrine, or vitious conuersation, be offended, or hindered from their proceedings, either in godlines, or good maners: now Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in all the places by you quoted, speaketh of not offending in matters and things in their owne nature indifferent, neither prohibited by God in his word, nor by any lawfull ordinance of man.</p>
                        <p>He that openly any thing either doth or saith, forbidden of God, both sinneth against God, &amp; giueth offence to man: and may expect, without repentance, a fearfull and double punishment, both for his fact, which is ill, &amp; for the example he therby giueth, which is worse.</p>
                        <p>Againe, he that in things indifferent, and at mans libertie to doe, or leaue vndone, hath not a tender care of weake Christians in his doing, sheweth that there is not that chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in him, nor regard of his brethren which God requireth. But though God doth not; yet if his deputies, the Gods ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restriall, do enioyne any thing to be done, not opposite to Gods word, and tending vnto concord among men, order and comelinesse, and we will not obey, nor fulfill their dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, for offending some persons, pretending themselues to
<pb facs="tcp:16597:12"/>
be weak, then are we so far from doing wel, as we do sin both against God, &amp; man, in not fulfilling their commandements.</p>
                        <p>If therefore charitie, by the texts of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> bindeth vs in things vncommanded, or not forbidden, to respect the weake; much more pietie and dutie towards our gouernors should incite vs to do the things enioined by iust lawes. Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to the lawfull ordinances of godly gouernors, is not only scandalous for the present, but may proue very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous in the consequent. Wherefore a wise man should not regard these lesser scandals of litle &amp; weake ones, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the inconueniences, &amp; great offences that arise &amp; may follow through the manifest contempt of lawes established.</p>
                        <p>And in cases (such as this Kneeling is) wherein we cannot chuse but offend, either by doing, or not doing that which is commanded, better is it to offend the lesse then the greater; a few priuate persons, then a whole State: and better barely to offend, then to offend and sin too, by fact and example, as by wilfull, and open disobedience we do.</p>
                        <p>In this point touching Kneeling, I know no weake ones that iustly may be offended; and if there bee, they are not much to be regarded, considering the long, and constant preaching of the truth in this land, touching these, and the like points in controuersie.</p>
                        <p>It is a notable saying of <hi>Zanchius,</hi> and approued by all learned and iudicious Diuines, that for a time some thing is to be yeelded vnto these weake ones (which you speake of) euen till the truth may be taught them. But after that the truth (about these matters in question, and the like) hath bin set forth, and laid open, so as nothing can iustly be obiected against the same, and yet purposely they will abide doubtful (and vnresolued,) then is not their infirmitie any longer, either by simulation or dissimulation to bee nourished.

                        <p>Since this Kneeling and other things deuised or abused by the Papists haue been so strictly vrged, they haue growne exceedingly in number, &amp; in boldnes, affirming that we are now come to sup of their broth, and ere it be long we will eate of their meate.</p>

                        <p>Lamentable experience doth tell vs, how the Papists haue but too exceedingly increased (the more is the pitie:) but to ascribe the cause thereof so peremptorily vnto the strict vrging of conformitie, and obedience vnto our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches orders, is more then he should doe which is not of the counsell of God.</p>
                        <p>I should rather, and peraduenture do, thinke, that the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate refusing to Kneele, and keepe the customes and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of our Church, doth not only hold backe many papists from ioyning with vs, but also cause the number of Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sants to increase. For is it likely that they, being naturally but too strict &amp; precise obseruers of outward ceremonies them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
<pb facs="tcp:16597:14"/>
wil euer brooke that Church and people, where wilful and refractarie men, either bee not punished at all, or but lightly and loosely censured?</p>
                        <p>Whefore, though we cannot let them to increase, (which is the iust punishment of God for our abusing the inestima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble treasure of his word:) yet would, yet should they lesse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, did either priuate persons yeeld more obedience to the lawfull Iniunctions of authoritie; or, (others being froward and incortigible) publique officers more strictly vrge them thereunto.</p>
                        <p>And would you (which I wish you would) by your selfe note &amp; consider how these Papists doe laugh in their sleeues to heare of the hot and eager contention that is among vs about this kneeling, and such other matters, it would make you to weepe, and doth cause me to sigh when I think ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as not seldome I doe.</p>
                        <p>Away therefore (brother <hi>S.</hi>) with this conceit, that the strict vrging of conformitie encourageth the Papists: this preconceit hath done much hurt, and not onely keepeth backe many from concurring with their brethren in due o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, but also encourageth &amp; increaseth the dangerous faction of our home Brownists. But this you will neuer put away, so long as you are of mind (which I pray God to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) that this Kneeling of ours was either deuised at the first, or abused afterwards by the Papists; and that nothing abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, though not deuised by them, may either be well vsed of inferiors, or strictly vrged by the superior power, when they are established.</p>
                        <p>No Papists, I think, wil affirm which you say, that in Knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at the holy Communion, we sup of their broth. Our Kneeling hath as much resemblance of their adoring, as our Communion affinitie with their Masse. We sup not of their
<pb facs="tcp:16597:15"/>
broth at our Communion, no more then they drinke of the Lords cup at their Masse. There is as little hope (God be thanked) that we shall eate of their meate, as that they will feed of our Banquets.</p>

                        <p>If what you say heere be true, (as it is most false) you also that do sit when ye do participate of that heauenly repast, as well as we that kneele, are violaters of the second comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement.

                        <p>I proue it thus: The Minister is to bee suspended for giuing the bread and wine to a communicant not Kneeling, but not for giuing them to a Communicant, that neither can, nor will examine himselfe, before he eateth and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth at the Lords table. <hi>Ergo.</hi>

                        <p>Your Antecedent is true in part, and in part not so.</p>
                        <p>True it is, that the Minister is to bee suspended for giuing
<pb facs="tcp:16597:19"/>
the bread and wine to a Communicant that can and wil not kneele: and his punishment is deserued. For vnworthie is he to minister, that refuseth to obserue the orders of that Church whereof he is a Minister. <hi>Caluin</hi> himselfe was not onely suspended, but also expulsed from the ministerie at Geneua, and that for his stubborn refusing to administer the Lords Supper, according to the order of that Church<note n="b" place="margin">Beza in vita Caluini.</note>.</p>
                        <p>There is no Church vnder the Sunne, but will haue the rites &amp; ceremonies there established, to be inuiolably kept, both of Minister and people.</p>
                        <p>Againe, the Antecedent is vntrue. For though Ministers bee not suspendable, for giuing the Sacrament vnto many that wil not examine themselues afore hand (&amp; why should they?) seeing neither Gods word, nor mans law, doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose such a charge vpon any Minister, namely, to examin all Communicants, who are to examine themselues<note n="c" place="margin">

                        <p>In the new testament, touching the Supper of the Lord (which we haue now in hand) the Apostle saith, <hi>That whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer shall eat this bread, &amp;c. vnworthily, shall be guiltie of the body &amp; blood of the Lord, eateth and drinketh his own damnation, &amp;c.</hi> &amp; procureth weaknes, sicknes and bodily death<note n="l" place="margin">1.

                        <p>Besides, you insinuate, that hauing said your worst, you could yet say more against the same, which would bee knowen.</p>
                        <p>But whatsoeuer you either thinke, or haue said, or can say, we would ye should know, that we are of mind, that our Gouernours do well, &amp; haue Gods word for their warrant, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>n commanding vs to Kneele; and that we do not ill, neither sinne, in obeying their commandements. For we are verely perswaded in our consciences, that we please God in knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; &amp; should sin, did we Sit, &amp; not Kneele, as many do. For Gods word is both for the approbation of all things ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king for order, comelines, and edification in the Church (of which nature we are out of doubt, and haue prooued our
<pb facs="tcp:16597:21"/>
Kneeling is;) and against all disorders, and vndecent ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures, tending to the decay of godly deuotion in Christian people, as the inreuerent, I say not irreligious, Sitting at the Lords table, as at a common and prophane banquet seemeth to be and is.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore I do thus argue against you:</p>
                        <p>That, for the doing whereof a man may haue faith, is to be done.</p>
                        <p>But for his Kneeling in the receiuing the holy Supper, a man may haue faith: Therefore it is to be done, (or we are to Kneele in the receiuing the Supper of the Lord.)</p>
                        <p>And against your Sitting, I doe thus reason, and cut you with your owne knife:</p>
                        <p>That, for the doing whereof no man among vs can haue faith, is not to be done: but for his Sitting in the receiuing the holy Supper of the Lord no man among vs can haue faith:</p>
                        <p>Therefore it is not to be done or vsed.</p>
                        <p>The proposition is your owne, or rather S. <hi>Pauls.</hi> The As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption is iustifiable, for you haue no warrant from Gods word, nor mans law for Sitting, as we haue for Kneeling; yea by this your Sitting a triple fault is committed. For first, Sitting at the receiuing the Lords Supper is without ground of Scripture, yea, is flat against Gods word, because it is against publique order, vndecent, and tendeth both to the nourishing of strife among brethren, and engendreth confusion among vs all.</p>
                        <p>Next, it is directly opposite to the publique ordinance of our Church.</p>
                        <p>And lastly, it is very offensiue both to the whole State, and to millions of Gods people, who like well and allow of Kneeling, and mislike of Sitting at the Supper of the Lord.</p>

persons whatsoeuer which receiue that holy Sacrament Kneeling, doe sinne, yea euen in kneeling cannot but sinne; or that their said Kneeling cannot be without sinne, who can so much as thinke this without great sinne? who can speake it without offence? who can heare it without hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and detestation?

                        <p>IT is to bee vnderstood, that howsoeuer Kneeling may (in itself considered) be esteemed a naturall ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture of the bodie, as Standing, Sitting, &amp;c: yet in this case it is by institution of man. For neither nature, nor custom doth teach vs ordinarily to kneele when we eate and drinke; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth the word require Kneeling in this case.</p>

                        <speaker>Pro.</speaker>
                        <p>Indeed Nature teacheth vs, whether we eat, drinke, or whatsoeuer we doe, to doe all things decently, and with good maners, but prescribeth no certaine forme and maner in eating and drinking, how we are to eat, or drinke, iudging all drinking and eating to be commendably, which is ciuilly done. And the God of Nature will haue all things in his church decently, &amp; in order performed, not setting down a maner how, but leauing the determination of formes to the discretion of his people; as deeming all things to bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendably, which are comely and orderly done in his Church.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb facs="tcp:16597:24"/>As then whatsoeuer the maner is of our eating and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king commonly in priuate houses, and taking our corporall repast, if it be ciuilly taken, is by the direction of Nature her selfe: euen so whatsoeuer the forme and maner of our ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, eating and receiuing the Sacramentall bread and wine in the holy Communion, is, if it be orderly taken and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently done, is from God and his word.</p>
                        <p>Albeit therefore neither Nature enioineth vs to Kneele, no more then to Sit or Stand, when we eate and drinke; nor the word or holy Scripture, to Kneele, no more then to Stand or Sit when we receiue the Sacrament: yet, as our common eating and drinking according to the laudable cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms of our country where we liue, is from Nature though instituted by man, or made vsuall by custome; euen so our Kneeling in eating and drinking the sacramentall bread and wine in the holy Communion, is from the word of God o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginally, though instituted by man, inasmuch as God is the fountaine of all decent orders in his Church, as after God Nature is the author of all ciuilitie &amp; good maners among men in the world.</p>
                        <p>Thinke not then how Kneeling at the Communion is by Institution of man, or meerely from man, not required by the word. For both man appointeth, and God approueth; and by authoritie from God man appointeth, and by the ministerie of man God approueth our Kneeling. And so our said Kneeling is not so much the institution of man, as of God, and required in his word.</p>
                        <p>So that in Kneeling, though sometimes, and some people may, yet alwayes, and all persons do not sinne, yea all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants, if otherwise they offend not, doe serue and please God by kneeling.</p>

                        <p>A fitter example could you not bring forth then this of Loue feasts. For neuer did Christ (to whose example in ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrating of his Supper you would precisely bind vs) insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,

                        <p>Next, that what Christ did, and what he said, and institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted is to be considered: and that what hee instituted is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes and necessarily to bee done, but not what he did.

Supper, contrarie to the institution of Christ: but we blame neither the Corinthians, and primitiue Church of old, nor the reformed Churches in these dayes, for swaruing from the forme of Christs ministring the Sacrament in certaine ceremoniall, indifferent, accidentall, and circumstantiall points, whom we should and would blame, were their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministring (how differing soeuer from the forme of Christ his celebrating) the holy Supper, a seruice displeasing, and not acceptable to God.</p>
                        <p>And here the wisdome of our Lord &amp; Sauiour sheweth it selfe most admirable, who hauing prescribed and instituted what hee would haue done; hath not prescribed yet the forme and manner how hee would haue the Sacraments administred, enioyning generall things, as Take, Eate, Drinke, &amp;c. but leauing the speciall maner of taking and receiuing the bread and wine vnto the libertie and discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his elected spouse; thinking that praise<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> worthy, and acceptable vnto his holinesse, whatsoeuer in this matter is formally, decently, and to the edification of his church and children, done and performed.</p>

                        <p>That as Loue feasts, so Kneeling at the receiuing the holy Communion and blessed Sacrament hath bin abused, the whole world doth know, and may not be denied.</p>
                        <p>Let it also be granted (which is most true) that the abuse
<pb facs="tcp:16597:29"/>
of Loue feasts was neuer so great, and scandalous in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles times, as the abuse of Kneeling was, &amp; is in the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue of Rome: But what make you of all this? May wee not therfore Kneele at any time, or in any reformed Church when we receiue the Communion, because there was, and is such abuse of Kneeling in the Synagogue of Rome? And if we in our Churches do Kneele, is our offence greater then the abuse of Loue feasts? or cannot that same thing be vsed without sinne or offence at one time and place, which is abused in another? or well vsed, and to Gods glory by some persons, which impiously and to the high dishonor of God is prophaned by others?</p>
                        <p>Kneeling in the verie act of receiuing, I confesse, of some hypocrites in our reformed Churches may be abused, as were the Loue feasts in the Apostles dayes; but so grosly; generally, and scandalously, as were either the Loue feasts in the primitiue Church, or is Kneeling in the Synagogue of Rome, me thinks you should blush to say, sure I am, you shall neuer proue.</p>
                        <p>You say Loue feasts were by superfluitie (I adde by sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setting also, drunkennesse, pride, vain-glorie, contempt of the poore Christians:) Kneeling also among the Papists vnto I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrie (a most horrible sinne) and superstition is abused: but so many wayes, in so open sort, so impiously is Kneeling abused in no Church reformed.</p>
                        <p>Loue feasts by many, and that openly were abused by bad<note place="margin">2. Pet. 2. 13. Iud. ver. 8.</note> Christians, who at those Loue feasts were as blots aud spots, but was not the fault of the whole Church Christian; Knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at the Masse is the sinne of all Caco-catholiques, yea and of their whole Church: but if Kneeling among vs in or any other Church is abused, the blame is to be laid neither vpon the whole Church, but vpon some particular professors;
<pb facs="tcp:16597:30"/>
neither is it an open and publique scandall, at least not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, nor euery where, but an hidden sinne of some fewe hypocrites.</p>

When <hi>Iohn</hi> baptized in Iordan; <hi>Philip</hi> at Samaria: <hi>Peter</hi> at Cesarea: <hi>Paul</hi> at Philippos: these and the rest of the Apostles in other places, did none which receiued the Sacrament, Kneele? Can you say they did not; dare you affirme they might not without sinne? Or in these dayes, in no Church and place, may no conuerted Iew, Turke, or Pagan, renouncing his or their impieties, and false worshippings, embracing the Gospel, and desirous to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated and baptized into the same bodie with vs, may not these, I say, nor any of these without sinne, yea a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting sinne receiue these fauours from God, and his Church, and be baptized Kneeling? And if some that can, may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that Sacrament Kneeling, may none yet participate of the heauenly graces offered especially in the Lords Supper to all worthie Communicants, Kneeling? And if in the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Sacrament of our Communion they may: yet may they not Kneele in that part of the Sacrament, which especially setteth forth our Communion with Christ? And if they so doe, thereby tempt they and prouoke they God to plague them, euen for their verie Kneeling, though neuer so reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, and with all possible Faith, charitie, and pietie done, and performed? O strange diuinitie!</p>
                        <p>No Sacrament, yea nothing so placeth before the eyes of our soules, either the wrath and iustice of God vpon man for sinne, or his Philanthropie, his tender &amp; incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible loue towards makind in his Sonne Christ Iesus, as the externall elements of bread &amp; wine consecrated at the holy Supper do; nor doth any part of the same Supper so af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the minds of the truly zealous and Christian, as the exhibiting before their eies, and putting into their hands the pledges of Gods pacification through Christ, the tokens
<pb facs="tcp:16597:32"/>
of our atonement with God. And therefore is no Sacrament so reuerently to be receiued as the Lords supper on our part; nor any part of the same Supper to bee performed with like ceremonies of zeale and deuotion, as the verie taking and receiuing the bread and wine, neither can wee so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse and testifie the same reuerence, as by Kneeling. Your selfe afore saide (then which you neuer spake truer words) how the most solemne signe of reuerence is Kneeling.</p>
                        <p>The Sacrament is called, you say, The Communion; be<note place="margin">Luke 22. 29. 1. Cor. 11. 26.</note> it so.

                        <p>To haue these thoughts, and to exhibit this adoration vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the elements, this is to communicate with Antichrist, and

                        <p>As therefore it is not the Kneeling, but the impious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits wherewith their hearts bee possessed and replenished, when they approch to the Sacrament, that maketh the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists to be Idolaters: so neither doth our Kneeling exclude vs from all Communion with Christ, and his Church; nor your Sitting, that ioyneth you in fellowship with the same.</p>

                        <p>Sittng &amp; kneeling are but outward ceremonies, nothing to the substance of Religion, concerning the true communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Christ and his Church at all, and of themselues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, did not the godly Magistrate enioine the one, and prohibit the other.</p>

                        <p>Many other causes, and reasons may be alleadged why this Sacrament was instituted at the first, and is frequented still of Gods people; whereof though the setting out of our Communion, and spirituall familiaritie with him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing in him, be one; yet it is not the onely end, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny being besides, many gestures in diuers respects, and not
<pb facs="tcp:16597:38"/>
one onely, is required for the more seemely receauing the same externallie.</p>
                        <p>Againe, there being many causes, and ends of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing the holy Supper, one, and the same site of body nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth remember vs, nor can present, and represent all those ends vnto vs and others. And therefore as sitting may note our communion, and familiarity: so kneeling our thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes vnto God.</p>
                        <p>But if this spirituall Communion, and comfort onely be<note place="margin">1. Cor. 12.</note> thereby signified (as nothing is more vntrue) yet is the same expressed by the other Sacrament of Baptisme, as well as by this; and represented as well by water, consisting of many drops, as either of wine, effected of many grapes, or of bread, made of many graines. Which Baptisme yet is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ministred, nor vrged so to be, by Sitting, as the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is.</p>
                        <p>Neither is our corporall foode alwaies, and euery where, to the greatest comfort, and token of sweetest familiarity, receiued Sitting; but sundry writers haue their seuerall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shions in their friendly, and comfortable refreshings; some taking the same one way, some another, not all Sitting, especially in the Easterne parts of the world. The antient Fathers, some of them called this sacrament, as the Lords Supper; so a Sacrifice: and that which the bread and wine were set vpon; as the Lords Table, so an Altar. Whereof saith reuerent, and most learned <hi>Zanchie,</hi> although that<note place="margin">Zanch. de lege dei. fol. 444.</note> Altars serue rather, and be more meete for the offering, then for the ministration of the Supper: yet seeing neither Christ, nor his Apostles either prohibited Altars, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended vnto vs the vse of wooden tables, therefore is this also of (altars) to bee numbred among things indifferent; and free for all, and euery man to vse tables either of wood,
<pb facs="tcp:16597:39"/>
or stone at his discretion, prouided that all superstition be remooued. For what is an Altar (saieth that holy and peaceable man) what is an altar but a table made of stones? about which would not I contend (saith hee,) if so be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise there is a consent in the true doctrine and worship of God. All this hath <hi>Zanchie,</hi> which we say of Kneeling, and the like.</p>
                        <p>And would to God you would so thinke of our Knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and others Altars, and of all things else in good vse in reformed Churches, that be indifferent. Then would, then could you neuer say, that not Kneeling, and Sitting is for receiuing.</p>
                        <p>It had bin too much for you to haue said, how not knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, but auerring that Sitting is for receiuing (as if none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gesture were for the commodious and meete receiuing thereof, but Sitting) is very bad.</p>
                        <p>The first admonitioners which so disliked Kneeling at the Communion, neuer vrged their Sitting, as a thing neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, as you doe, saying, not Kneeling, but Sitting is for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing. For, say they, wee make not Sitting a thing of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity<note place="margin">Admon in the addit.</note> belonging to the Sacrament, neither affirme wee that it may not be receiued otherwise.</p>
                        <p>Therefore better iudge they of these than you doe, but they best of all, who take them as they are, things of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues indifferent, and so except authority determine other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, like to be deemed, and that as good Communion and society they haue with Christ and his Church (hauing on them the wedding garment of Faith) which receiue Knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, as they which Sit, so as no man for the very act of knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, no more then of Sitting, sinneth.</p>

And though I shreudly coniecture you are of that minde: yet being not willing to take you at the worst, let vs know the reason why a gesture was obserued, though not prescribed at the holy Supper, which was neither prescribed nor obserued at Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme and Circumcision.</p>

But the gesture being but for that time, as may appeare by the omission thereof, when the obseruation of<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 17.</note> the Passeouer was established, our Master Christ, who<note place="margin">Mat. 26. 20.</note> came not to breake, but fulfill the Law, and knew what was fittest to be done, did eate the Passeouer Sitting, a gesture more answerable to eating in peace, than the former vsed in Egypt.</p>

                        <p>Because God prescribed to the Iewes a forme of taking, and eating the Passeouer, hath hee therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
<pb facs="tcp:16597:40"/>
a forme to Christians of taking, and receiuing the Lords Supper? The one you manifest, the other I would see prooued.</p>
                        <p>But had our God set downe, (as he hath not) the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how Christians should receaue the Supper, as hee ordained how the Passeouer should bee taken, and eaten of the Iewes: yet because you heere confesse, that this forme of eating the Passeouer, in processe of time was altered, the Iewes now eating the same Sacrament for substance, but after a new manner, sitting in Christs time, (for so you say) standing afore, and yet without sinne: why may not wee Christians, vpon as good reasons, retaining the substance, change the manner after which the holy Supper was ministred, and receiued in the daies of Christ?</p>
                        <p>Before Christ his time, there were additions vnto, (you heard afore) in Christ his time there were alterations of the manner of taking the Passe-ouer (your selfe do say) yet all well liked and allowed of the Lord. Had the Iewes more libertie to adde formes, euen of admimistring the Sacraments, then Christians haue? Or be Christians in more bondage this way, and restrained than the Iewes? And might the Iewes vpon good considerations doe these things, and may not Christians without sinne doe as they did?</p>
                        <p>Wee take therefore what you acknowledge (though wee will not acknowledge it to be true) namely, that the manner of taking, and receauing the Passe-ouer, was alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: the Iewes taking it at the first standing, in processe of time, sitting.</p>

                        <p>Kneeling differeth from Sitting, Standing, Walking, and the like; but answereth to eating, and drinking well enough.

                        <p>Because (such Kneeling) it darkeneth the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell<note place="margin">Iob 38. 2. 1.

                        <p>For the ratifying of these your assertions you quote Scripture, and bring a reason. The places of Scripture which you quote be two, the former out of <hi>Iob;</hi> the latter from S. <hi>Paul.</hi>

                           <hi>darkeneth the counsell by words without knowledge?</hi> alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged onely for the phrase sake, but concerneth the point in controuersie not a whit. S. <hi>Pauls</hi> words bee these: <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the same manner also hee tooke the cuppe, when he had supped, saying, this cuppe is the new Testament in my blood, This doe</hi>
                           <note place="margin">1. Cor. 11. 25. 26.</note> 
                           <hi>as oft as you shall drinke it in remembrance of mee. For as often as</hi>

                           <hi>yee shal eat this bread, and drinke this cup, yee shew the Lords death till he come.</hi> Now what is this also against our Kneeling: They which worthily participate of the bread and wine, though they Kneele, doe as comfortably, and familiarly Communicate in the blessings of God, as they which in any other sort receiue the Sacraments.</p>
                        <p>Your reason that it obscureth the reioycing familiaritie which the Lords Supper signifieth and sealeth, because it is a signe of the greatest submission, is so farre from obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that it furthereth the same reioycing familiarity no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more.</p>
                        <p>For who can receiue either to Gods glory more notably, or to their owne soules ioy more comfortably, then they which with the greatest signe of submission, and that vnto the diuine Maiestie, repaire vnto the holy Supper?</p>
                        <p>Afore you said, and truely, how kneeling was a signe of the greatest reuerence; here you say, It is the greatest signe of submission. These are no reasons to driue vs from it, but very forcible motiues to make vs with cheerefulnes and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacrity to continue our Kneeling.</p>
                        <p>Besides, you argue (me thinkes) but from a particular, as though spirituall familiaritie only, and not other things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, and namely and especially a gratefull remembrance, and thankefull acknowledgement of all Gods mercies and fauours, which is best expressed by Kneeling, were to be in our thoughts.</p>
                        <p>When there be many causes inducing vs to receiue the Sacrament; if we chuse that gesture we aboue all may testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie our true humiliation, and thankefulnesse vnto God, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then our reioycing familiaritie one with another; blame vs not. And yet is this corporall submission, and submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue
<pb facs="tcp:16597:41"/>
thankefulnes at no time without much spiritituall ioy; and it may be, more encreaseth godly ioy in them which Kneele, and in them too before whom they Kneele, then your acknowledged lesse reuerent Sitting, as at a common feast.</p>

                        <p>And of the same kisse, <hi>Nec est dubitandum</hi> (saith <hi>Peter Martyr</hi>) it is not to bee doubted, how in the primitiue<note place="margin">

The marginall annotation from Geneua vpon<note place="margin">Geneua annota. on 1.

                        <p>Marke these things aduisedlie, and you shall see,</p>
                        <p>First, that to the administration of the Supper, ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, as kissing (more then euer Christ, that wee know, practised, sure I am, then hee euer prescribed) were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, how the said ceremonies were very elegant, and significant:</p>

                           <pb facs="tcp:16597:42"/>And lastly, that the said addition, and ceremonies (no not for their mysticall signification) were neuer dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med either vnlawfull or childish (as you childishlie doe call them) but very highlie commended both by the Apostle, and worthy interpretors in the Church of Christ.</p>
                        <p>But to proceede still in the sacred Supper still in hand. There be actions of the minister, and of the people, and yet all ceremoniall, and significant.</p>
                        <p>The action of the minister giuing the bread and wine, representeth Gods action in giuing Christ, with his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits to the particular communicants. Againe, the action (whether by sitting, kneeling, or by whatsoeuer done) of receauing the bread and wine seuerallie, resembleth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther speciall action of the beleeuing heart, which applieth<note place="margin">T<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Indeed that Christ did Sit at his holy Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is but a supposall. There is a marginall annotation in the Geneua Bible, which speaketh thus: <hi>Their fashion was</hi>

                        <p>If Christ did not Sit, as these men say: and againe, if halfe lying bee not to Sit, surely it must be more then halfe a lie, without all supposals to affirme our Sauiour (as often as you haue done) to haue sat at the Sacred boord.

                        <p>Besides, the example you bring of our Sauior Christ is of good regard. For, as the Euangelist hath described, Christ before this holy supper, &amp; after the Passeouer, laid aside his<note place="margin">Ioh. 13. v. 4. 5.</note> vpper garment, and tooke a towell, &amp; girded himselfe. After that, he powred water into a Bason, and began to wash the disciples feete, and to wipe them with the towell wherewith he was girded. And after he had washed their feete, and had taken his garments, and was set (or laid) downe againe, hee said vnto them: <hi>Know you what I haue done to you, &amp;c. If I then your Lord and maister, haue washed your feet, yee also ought towash one anothers feete.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>So did, and so spake our Sauiour Christ, thereby not onely mouing by his example, but also enioyning them by strong reason to do that which himselfe had done: yet is there not

one among you (the most earnest vrgers of this Sitting, and that after the example of Christ) that either doe as our Sauiour did before hee administred this Sacrament, or regard his motion. Wherein if you doe well, you may further see, that Christ his actions are not necessarily to be followed alwayes in matters ceremoniall especially, as afore hath beene said.</p>

                        <p>IT may be demanded, why the church is not bound to the time of Euening, aswell as to the gesture of<note place="margin">Iohn 13. 12.</note> Sitting, sith Christ obserued the one as well as the other.</p>

                        <p>You hold still the Church is bound to the gesture of Sitting. But you are to bee put in minde, how this is but a meere fancie of yours. Your worthie master <hi>Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright</hi> dissenteth herein from you (as otherwayes some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time<note place="margin">T.

                        <p>A certaine gesture (say you,) but no certaine time was chosen by Christ; who appointing no time when, doth choose a manner how his Supper should bee mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred, <hi>viz.</hi> in your opinion, Sitting. And yet the Scripture beareth witnesse (to nothing more plainly) that hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted and celebrated his Supper in the night, choosing that speciall time for that purpose, as well as the Sitting you speake of.</p>
                        <p>But if hee chose no such time (as you would make the world beleeue) but left the time free, and at the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie of his people to limit; then made hee no more choice of Sitting, then of anie other site. For hee either chose both, or neither; and wee are no more tied to the necessarie obseruation of the one, then of the other. For hee vsing both a speciall time, and a certaine ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, if hee chose the one hee chose both; and if his example bee of vs necessarilie to bee followed in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, it is to bee followed also in the time; wee can no more alter the one, then wee may change the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

                        <p>But it may not bee acknowledged (which now the second time also you say) that their newe Sitting was fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for a time of rest, then their old Standing, God hauing prescribed this Standing for a perpetuall memorie (euen till the reall Passion of Christ) of their suddaine and safe deliuerance from the most grieuous thraldome of theirs in Egypt.</p>
                        <p>But did, or might the Iewes before the verie and full time was come that the said Passeouer was to take an end, alter the rite and site of eating the same, chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging their Standing prescribed into Sitting, not enioynd by God, but deuised by themselues, as fitter to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent their present and future rest, then their former trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles: may not Gods people in these dayes change the
<pb facs="tcp:16597:45"/>
site of Christs Sitting (if he did Sit,) which was neuer prescribed vnto Christians, into Kneeling in their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion?</p>
                        <p>The Iewes transgressed not the institution of the Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer (say you) by changing a gesture at the first prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed of God: and doe Christians transgresse the insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Supper, by changing a gesture neither first, nor last, nor at all prescribed, if practised by Christ?</p>
                        <p>And might Christians in former dayes lawfully change the time chosen by Christ, but not prescribed, into some other fitter (in discretion) for the ordinarie celebrating of the Lords Supper: and doe Christians now offend in chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging a corporall gesture, no more enioined then was the time, into some fitter (in discretion) for the celebrating of the Lords Supper in a publique Church, at open publique praier, and thanksgiuing?</p>
                        <p>Haue not Christians in these indifferent matters as great power as had the Iewes, and the now liuing Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians as their forefathers?

                        <p>You haue strange thoughts both of our Kneeling, and prayers at the Communion for our said Kneeling, and of our Kneeling for the said Prayers sake.</p>
                        <p>Kneeling, say you, was deuised and abused by Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ. But you cannot prooue our Kneeling by Antichrist to be either deuised, or abused.</p>
                        <p>Antichrist, and Antichristians they doe kneele, but it is at their Masse, and other prayers, both vngodly and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious: our kneeling at the Communion neither did hee deuise, nor doth abuse; and if he were the deuiser of the same, yet vse wee that gesture well, and to Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
<pb facs="tcp:16597:48"/>
which hee deuised, or his members abuse vnto idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie.</p>
                        <p>Againe, Kneeling doth crosse the practise of Christ (say you) and his Apostles: which is also vntrue. For well may it differ, as doe all formes of administring the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly suppervsed in the Church, one way or other, from the practise of Christ, but in nothing doth it crosse, or contrarie the same; or if it doe, shew wherein that we may see the fault, and amend it.</p>
                        <p>And though wee kneeled not: yet (in your opinion) should we crosse the practise of Christ, and his Apostles, euen for those prayers of ours. Which if you speake as you thinke, hereafter condemne vs not for bending our knees (as very bitterlie you haue done, but as vniustly) but blame vs for lending our eares attentiuely vnto the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers vttered when we receiue; yea, blame vs for saying those prayers, or Amen vnto them.</p>
                        <p>These prayers of ours you condemne as wicked, first, because there may seeme a vaine repetition, next, for that the adding of them to the words of institution, is contrarie to the minde of Christ, wherein you plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do manifest your detestation of the prayers, but shew no word in them for all that, sauoring of impietie and error.</p>
                        <p>They seeme, nay, they may seeme (say you) a vaine repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition.</p>
                        <p>What they seeme in your eyes, nay what they seeme not, but may seeme, is not materiall: if they seemed so, you would shew it; if they were a vaine repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, you would say, and prooue it. Your manner is not to extenuate faultes, but to aggrauate offenses; yea to make faultes where there be none, as in all your discourse hitherto you haue done nothing els.</p>

                        <p>These additions of ours adde nothing to the substance, but onely to the forme of ministring Gods Sacraments; and therefore not vnlawfull, nor contrary to the minde of Christ.</p>

                        <p>Artolatrie is the euill of the Romish Church: there is neither that euill, nor a shew thereof among vs, who acknowledge no breaden God, much lesse giue any shew of adoration vnto bread and wine.

                        <p>These things were they duly considered as they ought
<pb facs="tcp:16597:56"/>
seriously, me thinkes it should be far from the thought of any man (professing the same doctrine with vs, and dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting the religion of the synagogue of <hi>Rome</hi>) to imagine, that we in kneeling doe communicate with that whorish Church, who are not so seuered in doctrine, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, as for our worshipping of God, and doctrine, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all hope of atonement, or reconciliation, separated in body, but in affections much more.</p>
                        <p>This notwithstanding, were their doctrine and worship as good, as the signes of their deuotion, commendable, whom we do communicate withall in a dumbe ceremony, and in different (if to kneele at our chiefest prayers, and praisings of God, bee a communicating with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>) wee would also most willingly communicate withall in their worship and doctrine. And we wish and pray, that as we conuert some of their vsages to God his glory: so they may be conuerted vnto the same doctrine, and worship among vs, that with our heart, and forme aswell of doctrine and worship, as ceremonies, wee may glorifie God together in this world.</p>
                        <p>In the meane while wee shall, and as much doe dislike your sitting (who are like vs in the maine points of doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,) as we like of their kneeling (in it one nature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered) who are most vnlike vs in doctrine, and the true worship of God. For we hold it better to come neere the superstitious Papists (who make showes of great deuotion at Kneeling); than to prophane persons in sitting at the communion (a signe of no deuotion, or of very smal) espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in these dayes, wherein wee are to feare more, the ouerflowing of Atheisme, then th'encrease of superstitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>

                        <p>Kneeling, no not at the communion, is not any scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall in our Church; sitting is.

But our doctrine is most pure, and sound, no Papist can shew; no Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick will say; no aduersary what-so-euer shall euer proue the contrary.

                        <p>Yes, it is so also in regard of multitudes (indeed the most part of the people) either not sufficiently instructed in the right vnderstanding and vse of the Sacraments, and therefore carried with a blind zeale, learned by tradition; or corrupted (more or lesse) with the leauen of Popery.</p>

Cor. 13. 7. 10.</note> time, and that by the Apostles: yet many wanted knowledge, &amp; euen vnto that time, did eate as a thing sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifised vnto an Idol: of whome if any should see a man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with knowledge sit at table in the Idolls Temple,
<pb facs="tcp:16597:59"/>
his weake consciences might occasinatly be emboldened to eate those things which are sacrificed to Idols.</p>

                        <p>This instance of yours is to be regarded.</p>
                        <p>The Apostle speaketh of Idolatries, or meates not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated, but euen sacrificed vnto Idols. This meate so abused, the Apostle condemneth not, as vnlawfull to bee eaten of Christians. But hee blameth those Christians who in the Idols temple among Idolaters did eate the same meate, to the offence of all Christians, especially of the weake.</p>
                        <p>Now be it that Kneeling (as the meate sacrificed vnto Idols) hath beene abused of Papists: yet as meate so sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed might bee both sold in the market, and bought, and eaten of Christians priuately, or without offence: so the gesture of Kneeling, abused by Idolaters may be well vsed of Christians.</p>
                        <p>Which may show how farre you Schismatickes are out of the way of truth, and from the minde of the first and primitiue Christians; who thinke that nothing ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deuised, or abused by Papists, may or can bee well vsed in reformed Churches; and therefore doe vtterly condemne among other things, this our Kneeling.</p>
                        <p>But if you finde vs to kneele in the idols temple offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereby the weake, and making them to fall, and confirming of Idolaters, then deserue wee the blame which those temporizers at <hi>Corinth</hi> deseruedly did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre. But this you charge vs not withall, vnlesse you thinke our Temples to bee Idols houses, and all commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants to be idolaters.</p>
                        <p>Besides, it was free for Christians to eate, or not to eate those meates, so it were not with offence to the weake: but it is not free for vs of the Church of England,
<pb facs="tcp:16597:59"/>
to Kneele, or not to Kneele at the holy Communion.

                        <p>In his case (not in this case about Kneeling) <hi>Paul</hi> would not offend. This case of ours, is not <hi>Pauls</hi> case.</p>
                        <p>For touching meates <hi>Paul</hi> was at liberty to eate, or not to eate; neither God, nor by his authority, man hauing forbidden meate, or any kinde of meate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but lawfull pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er hath imposed this order of Kneeling vpon our shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: whereas he therefore was free, we are not.</p>
                        <p>Where orders well were established, who euer was more pliant to obserue them? who a greater aduersarie to those which would not obey, and fulfill them, then this Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> without respect of any seeming to bee weake?</p>

ordering of Christians, said he euer he would neuer keep them, then thereby offend the weake? Nay, he both pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed orders to be kept, not to bee contemned; and reproued them which would not keepe them, but were<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11. 16.</note> contentious.</p>
                        <p>Therefore not after the example onely of the Apostle, but according to the commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t also of God, we may yeeld obedience to the higher powers, and their lawfull Impositions, about matters in their owne nature (till they bee either prescribed, or prohibited) indifferent: such is our Kneeling at the holy Table, where in charitie we are to thinke none superstitiously doe receiue; and if some do, it is their priuate offence, no publike fault of the whole Church.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, when you grant that some persons very religiously receiue, when others superstitiously doe so: see you not how with one, and the same breath, you graunt the said Kneeling to bee a gesture indifferent (which before you denied) abused by some, well vsed, and without sinne by others: Which ouer-throweth vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly your assertion, namely that Kneeling in the very act of receiuing the Sacramentall Bread and wine in the holy communion cannot be without sinne.</p>
                        <p>Say not then hence forward how dare a Christian man hauing knowledge kneele in the presence of any, who for want of knowledge receiue superstitiously? for such a Christian dare kneele, &amp; hauing good warrant for his so doing, may work much good thereby his exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Kneeling teaching both the weake to cast away their vncharitable, and rash supitions of their neighbours, and brethere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for Kneeling (who doubt lesse, if by none ouert act or speech they declare the contrary (receiue religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously);

For our churches bee not Idols temples; our Tables in them not Idols tables; our communicants, not the worst of them, no not so much as in show (but onely by surmise, and vnbrotherly suspitions) superstitions.

                        <p>That teachers, especially faithfull teachers decrease, I hope not, sure I am is not so notorious as that Papists do encrease, and the encreasing of these to bee the diminuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the superstitions you speake of.

the said Surplice to bee worne of the holy Ministers, albeit Papists do swarme in this kingdome. Thereby not strengthening them as by a Popish relique in their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie, but letting them, and all men see that hee condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth<note place="margin">Sum of the confer. pa. 75.</note> nothing in vse among them, that may bee well vsed. And yet had you marked what followeth (proceeding from the soundnesse, and profoundnesse of his most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent iugdement,) you might haue seene that his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse vtterly condemneth not all the doctrine, and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies in the Church of Rome taught, and vsed, but those ceremonies onely, and doctrines, which are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, sauoring of error, and superstition, not of the puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and veritie of the primitiue Christians. There should you read and perceiue his constant and resolute opinion to bee, that no Church ought further to separate it selfe from the church of <hi>Rome</hi> either in doctrine, or ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, than shee hath departed from her selfe, when she was in her flourishing and best estate, and from Christ, her Lord and head.</p>

                        <p>The same State which changed vnleauened into vsual, and bread leauened, in place of your pretended sitting, hath appointed Kneeling at the Communion: changing the site by the same authority, which she did the bread, thereby doing well in both or neither.</p>

                        <p>Nay rather it is likely, that by the commandement, the Scandall should bee the greater, especially in regard of the 27. Canon, where ministers are commanded, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der paine of suspension, not wittingly to administer the Sacraments to any, but to such as Kneele.</p>

                        <p>The Canon is necessary, and to the preseruation of vnitie, and the preuenting of hatefull confusions, which otherwise too-offensiuely would spring, &amp; spread ouer the kingdome. Dangerous maladies, must haue ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and biting medicines.</p>
                        <p>Gods ministers may thanke you Schismatikes for this seuere discipline.</p>
                        <p>They that wil not receiue Gods sacraments but as they list, must by seuerity be driuen to take the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as they should.</p>
                        <p>It is a good rule in Phisicke, stay the beginnings. The Philosophers do say how <hi>Mod<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>eus error in principio, fit maximus in fine.</hi> That error which at the last was greatest, at the first was but a little one: in Diuinitie we finde the same to bee most true. For the foulest, and most horrible heresies sprang but of petty Schismatikes at the first.</p>
                        <p>They must in time meete with, &amp; cut of those Shismes, that would not haue the Church pestered and molested with heretikes.</p>
                        <p>This very discourse of ours may put the world in minde, what hideous &amp; horrible fancies this Recusancie of yours to Kneele, &amp; leauing the vnion of the Church,
<pb facs="tcp:16597:64"/>
and Communion with vs in the sacraments (because yee will not kneele) hath already ingendred. Your errors here-about are foule and monstrous, and yet worser are behinde: for the preuenting whereof we are on all sides, from the King to the lowest, and meanest subiect, to set to our helping hands.</p>
                        <p>Neither be you, nor any other men to thinke that pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment seuere, which is rather necessarily, for a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like good; then willingly inflicted.</p>

                        <p>May not simple and superstitious persons take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion thus to argue? Why should Kneeling be thus vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by authority, if the sacramental signing of the body, and blood of Christ, bee no more to be reuerenced then water applyed in Baptizing children? seeing that is also a sanctified signe of Christ his blood, that washeth away our sinnes and iniquity?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>P.</speaker>
                        <p>If they will by you be aduised, the simple and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious shall so argue; and thereby fall into a loathing of our manner of receiuing the sacrament.</p>
                        <p>But you, and they must be answered, how the church of England hath the two sacraments in equall price and estimation, conceiuing highly, and religiously of them both, but ascribing diuine adoration, yea none adoration at all either vnto the Bread, &amp; wine of the one, or vnto the water of the other: albeit the water signifieth Christ his blood that washeth away our sins &amp; iniquity &amp; the bread &amp; wine, the body and blood of Christ, shed and giuen for mans redemption.</p>
                        <p>But for-so-much as we are baptized infants, when wee know not what wee do; and are men, old or young when wee partake of the other; also that the very Bread and VVine, exhibited to these, senses, and handes
<pb facs="tcp:16597:65"/>
of all communicants, do sacramentally represent the body, and bloud of our Lord; the Ministers deliuerie of them, Gods very offering his fauours in Christ vnto vs; the bread broken, his body dead; the wine, his bloud shed vpon the Crosse; lastly, the distributing both of the wine and bread, Christ his benefits, and Gods blessings imparted and communicated vnto all Communicants, whereof they be remembred so oft as they receiue, in all places of the world, and to the worlds end: what Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian seeing, and seriously considering these and the like things, but will bee excited with all due submission and religious reuerence to come vnto the participation, and receiuing of such celestiall fauours? Not because it is either vnlawfull, or vndecent with like reuerence to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the other Sacrament, but for that partly our ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse is such, because of our yeares, that wee cannot; and partly the necessity is not so vrgent, that wee need to Kneele. But doubtlesse were wee of good yeares, and did know what we go about, when we are to be baptized, as we know what we do (such is my perswasion, and ought to be of vs all, of all persons communicating at the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per) when wee come to the table of the Lord, doubtlesse the Lord would not be displeased, did we Kneele at Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, then our assured perswasion is, that hee is not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with our Kneeling at his Supper.</p>
                        <p>Therefore whereas all worthy communicants, euen in duty, and conscience are bound with this signe of reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, to receiue these holy and heauenly mysteries; and yet many persons, in one respect or other, will not bend, nor bow their Knees, but in no case Kneele; if authoritie doe force such stubborne and wilfull persons to doe that necessarily, which of themselues voluntarily they should
<pb facs="tcp:16597:65"/>
performe, neither doth authoritie transgresse their bounds; nor do they sinne, that obay their command.</p>
                        <p>And so let this satisfie those simple and superstitious persons, and be an answer vnto you.</p>
