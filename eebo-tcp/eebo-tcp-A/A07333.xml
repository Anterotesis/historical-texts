            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi rend="sup">b</hi> This great battell of Creſcy, where King <hi>Edward</hi> obtained ſo full, and wonderfull a victory, is at large reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Poem, and therefore little ſhall need here to bee ſpoken of it, but onely of the numbers which fought or dyed on both ſides. The Engliſh Army by generall conſent of almoſt all Authors conſisted of 30000. The French, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thoſe that ſpeake leaſt, together with their aux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iliaries, were about 60000. But many Authors of good credit report their number twice as many, others agree upon an hundred thouſand. Upon that Saturday, being the 26 of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1346, when this great battell was fought, the ſlaughter was great on the French ſide, for none were taken to mercy upon that day, for the Conquerors thought it not ſafe for themſelves to take any Priſoners. But the next morning preſented new worke; for a great miſt aroſe, that men could hardly ſee the diſtance of an acre of ground from them; when as many troops of Frenchmen from Roan, Beavicois, and other Cities comming to joyne themſelves with King <hi>Philip,</hi> (and not hearing of his diſcomfiture) together with great multitudes of ſuch as had loſt their way in the laſt flight, lighted vnhappily upon the victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Engliſh, and were ſeverely put to the Sword. Among thoſe that came with freſh forces to ayd the King were the Archbiſhop of Roan, and the Grand Prior of France; who
<pb facs="tcp:12859:50"/>
were both ſlaine after a great and ſore battell with the Engliſh; for they brought a good ſtrength with them. The Earles of Northampton, Suffolke and Norfolke had exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the French, which fled from this laſt overthrow, for the ſpace of nine Engliſh miles from the ground where they encountred. And it is the generall conſent of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, that more of the French were ſlaine upon this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond day, then were the day before, when the great battell was fought; ſome Priſoners were then taken, though none of great name, for they were ſpent in the day before. When the account was taken, it was found that there dyed in all of the French ſide eleven great Princes, of Earles, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons, and gentry of high account about fifteene hundred, of common ſouldiers above thirty thouſand. And to make the victory the more wonderfull, there was not one man of honour or note ſlaine upon the Engliſh ſide, of common ſouldiers ſo few, that we finde no mention of the number.</p>

was not much; for the Spaniards were too ſoone rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and did not in their owne deare quarrell behave themſelves ſo ſtoutly as their French auxiliaries did. But there were ſlaine of them, beſides five hundred Gentlemen of quality, above ſeven thouſand of the common ſouldiers. Of the Engliſh ſide were ſlaine (of men of quality) but foure Knights, two Gaſcoignes, one Almaine, and the fourth an Engliſh-max; and of common ſouldiers about ſixteene hundred, as ſome write; though <hi>Froiſſard</hi> ſaith, not above forty: but the other number is more credible, conſidering how fiercely the battell was fought, as all agree. There were taken Priſoners to the number of two thouſand, and among them the Earle of Dene, Sir <hi>Bertram</hi> of Cleſquy, the Marſhall <hi>Dandrehen,</hi> and many other men of name.</p>

The Lords of Arminiague, D'Albret, Peregot, Cominges, and many others made their proteſtations againſt the King of England, for the Crowne of France, alleaging that

they were by nature to obey that, and not a ſtrange Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne: that it was abſolutely againſt the fundamentall law of the kingdome to diſſever them from the Crowne: that the Contract was made in priſon, and therefore by the right of Nations not to obliege: therefore they utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſclaim'd the government of England. By their exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the Cities of the County of Ponthieu, which was King <hi>Edward</hi> his undoubted inheritance, revolted all to the French King. King <hi>Edward</hi> complained of this breach of Accord to the Pope and other Chriſtian Princes, but trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties availed little the Engliſh ſide, when the French hearts were weary of their yoake, and reſolved to returne to their old obedience. From this time, being the 42 yeare of King <hi>Edward's</hi> reigne, the tide of Fortune was turned from the Engliſh to the French ſide; <hi>Edward</hi> the Renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Prince of Wales was ſicke of a lingring malady, and not able to endure the travell of Warre; and old King <hi>Edward</hi> was miſ-led in England by evill ſervants, which cauſed diſquiet in Parliaments, and many diſtempers in the State at home. All theſe occaſions were politikely looked into by <hi>Charles</hi> (ſurnamed the <hi>Wiſe</hi>) King of France, who though, forewarned by his father and Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers miſ-fortunes, he never would venture any pitch'd battels againſt the Engliſh (for there were divers Armies ſent over from hence after that time, but returned fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, as the Chronicles will informe you) yet hee omitted

no opportunities of recovering his kingdome by ſecret ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citations, large promiſes, and other wary practiſes; by which as alſo ſome fortunate skirmiſhes of <hi>Bertram</hi> his beſt ſervant hee recovered all before the death of King <hi>Edward,</hi> except the Towne of Calleis onely. Thoſe emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent victories and great actions, by which the Engliſh had gained ſo much of France, have beene the ſubject of this Hiſtoricall Poem: the particular revolts, flye practices, and petty actions, by which inſenſibly it was loſt againe, you may read diſtinctly in the Chronicles at large.</p>
