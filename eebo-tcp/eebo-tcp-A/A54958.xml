            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THat sweetness of temper I have had the Happiness to discover in the honour of your Company in the first place, and your favourable Opinion of my Play in the next, gives me Incouragement to claim your Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>I am often told, and always pleased when I hear it, that the Works not mine; but oh I fear your Closet view will too soon find out the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, the imperfect Woman there. The story was true, and the action gave it Life; for I shou'd be very rude not to own each maintain'd their Character beyond my hopes. Then that pretty Ornament, the ingenious Dialogue, these might divert you at the Theatre, but these avail not me; the reading may prove tiresome as a dull repeated tale: Yet I have still recourse to what I mention'd first, your good nature, that I hope
<pb facs="tcp:50318:3"/>
will pardon and accept it. I only wish my self Mistress of Eloquence, Rhetorick, all the Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Pen, that I might worthily entertain Mr. <hi>Minchall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your Noble Family has been long the Glory of my Native Country, and you are what I think no other Nation equals, a true English Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, kind to the distressed, a Friend to all. I dare not proceed—my Weakness wou'd too plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear in aiming at a Character which I can never reach: Therefore, I conclude, once more asking your Pardon, and leave to subscribe my self,</p>
            <closer>

            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Did not intend to have troubl'd the Reader with any thing of a Preface; for I am very sensible those that will be so unkind to Criticize upon what falls from a Womans Pen, may soon find more faults than I am ever able to answer. But there happens so gross a mistake, in calling it <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> the Thirteenth &amp;c. that I cannot help taking notice of it. I read some years ago, at a Relations House in the Country, Sir <hi>Paul Ricaut</hi>'s Continuation of the Turkish History; I was pleas'd with the story and ventur'd to write upon it, but trusted too far to my Memory; for I never saw the Book afterwards till the Play was Printed, and then I found <hi>Ibrahim</hi> was the Twelfth Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour. I beg Pardon for the mistake, and hope the Good-Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd World will excuse that and what else is amiss, in a thing only design'd for their Diversion.</p>
