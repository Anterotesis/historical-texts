            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is for your Reading,
and not for the Papists
chiefly that I publish
this short and hasty
writing. For I may
probably prognosticate of them,
1. That the lay men will not, must
not read it; 2. That the Priests, will
not read it with any impartiality, as
Lovers of Truth; 3. That what they
cannot answer they will silently dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble,
or if any meddle with it,
they will either take some scrap and
leave the rest; or they will spend
paper in cavilling at my 40. Reasons
<pb facs="tcp:50455:3"/>
against them, because, lest I be tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
I have not improved them by
Syllogistical form and full confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
and they will put off the
full answers already given them in
the former Books to which I refer
them, without a Reply: And they
will pass by the strength of what
they meddle with. 4. And when I am
dead, they will patch up some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
answer to some of my Books
(as vain as Mr. <hi>Iohnson, alias Terret,</hi>
hath done to one,) and will borrow
some lies, from the writings of
some against me that are of the same
spirit with them, wherewith to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
my Name, which shall be
instead of an answer to my Books.</p>
            <p>The Answer to their present
Question I have already fullier gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
them, 1. In my <hi>Reasons</hi> of the
<hi>Christian Religion;</hi> 2. And in my
<hi>More Reasons,</hi> 3. In my <hi>Life of Faith,</hi>
Part 2. 4. In my <hi>Safe Religion</hi> through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
<pb facs="tcp:50455:3"/>
especially Disp. 3. 5. In my
<hi>Key for Catholicks.</hi> 6. In my Preface
to the 2. Part of the <hi>Saints Rest.</hi> And
none of them that I know of are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered;
But they cant over and
over the same thing, and tempt or
necessitate us thereby to write over
and over the same thing, to the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
of the Readers, while they si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
dissemble all.</p>
            <p>But the end of this writing is, to
tell young unstudied persons, on
what terms, and in what order they
must deal with this great Question,
and defend the foundations of their
faith, against <hi>Infidels, Papists,</hi> and
the <hi>Devil</hi> himself, who will here as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault
us with greater craft and force,
than Papists or Infidels can do. Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
study it well, till thy soul is
clear and well confirmed; For the

them, in such kind of Papers, as
if their tenets had never been refuted at

ALL who call themselves
Christians are agreed in this
principle.</p>
            <p>That every Revelation of God,
or whatsoever God says is most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
true in the sense wherein he
intends it.</p>
            <p>And this is a matter of right on
Gods part, to have this granted.</p>
            <p>But all Christians do not agree;
and it is the sole point wherein
Christians differ:</p>
            <p>Whether God hath Revealed or
said what is proposed to us as his
Revelation: Or as the sense intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by him by that which they all
agree to be his Revelation.</p>
            <p>And this is purely matter of Fact,
<hi>(viz.)</hi> 1. Whether several Books af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
and proposed to us as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations
<pb facs="tcp:50455:6"/>
of God be truly so. For
Instance, the Old Testament affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by some to be, and proposed as the
Revelations of God, are denied by
the <hi>Valentinians</hi> and the <hi>Manichees.</hi>
The Gospels of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> St. <hi>Luke,</hi>
St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> and all St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles,
proposed by some Christians as the
Revelations of God, are denied by
others, namely by the <hi>Ebionites.</hi> So
likewise several parties agreeing se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Books to be Scripture and the
Revelation of God, do notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
differ touching the Copies,
and touching the Translations;
Some affirming one Copie to be
true, and one Translation to be true,
whilst others expresly say, that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
is false, and that Translation
false. And Lastly, several parties
agreeing the Books to be Scripture,
the Copies true, and the Translations
true, and to be the Revelation of
God, do nevertheless differ touching
<pb facs="tcp:50455:6"/>
the sense, each party delivering a
particular sense of such a Text, and
proposing such sense, as the sense, and
the only sense Revealed by God, to
be intended by God by that Text,
and each proposed sense being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the other.</p>
            <p>It is clear in any difference arising
touching matter of Fact, there can
only be one party which can have
the true Faith touching that matter,
for it is impossible one thing can be
a Revelation of God and no Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of God: That one Copy, or
one Translation, or one Sense can
be true and not true.</p>
            <p>It is now enquired whether
Christ hath setled any principle or
medium in the world: And what
principle or medium it is which
Christ hath setled in the world, for
the determining of matters of Fact
of this nature. By which Unity in
Faith may be conserved, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
<pb facs="tcp:50455:7"/>
may with certainty know
what is a true Revelation of God,
which a true Copy of such true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,
which a true Translation
of such true Copy, and what the
true sense thereof, that Christians
may not be carried about with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
wind of Doctrine.</p>
            <p>The solution of this is desired to
be by fixed and solid principles, and
not by tedious discourses; for the
Nature of the thing requires that
there be a firm Principle setled
among Men, for the final determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of matters of Fact.</p>

What the Papists ascertaining Medium or Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
is, and why we cannot trust our souls on
it: Where are fourty Reasons briefly named, for
the use of them that seek for Truth, proving not
only the utter uncertainty, but the notorious fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shood
of this Determination which is cried up as
the only proof of Certain faith. (But I doubt not
but many Papists that fear God indeed, do practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
build their faith on better ground, however
this be cried up by Disputers). <hi>p. 60.</hi>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>§. 1. <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>OU may see by this
Paper, with the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
disputing of this
sort of men, that it is
not without cause that
we have suspected the
hand of the Papists in many of the defences
of the Infidel cause, and questionings of the
foundations of the Christian faith, which
this age is troubled with. They have so
long plaid the Infidels in jeast, till they have
made such a swarm of serious Infidels, as will
prove neither the honour nor comfort of such
seducers in the end. I know that this Paper
it self hath a more modest aspect, but the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50455:10"/>
tendencie of it is the same as of the rest.
But I hope God will turn all their endeavours
to our advantage, and teach Christians bet-better
to consider the foundations of their
faith; that they may not only be able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
it against an Infidel or Papist; but,
which is of more universal and frequent ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
to defend it against the inward sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions
of Satan, the enemy of Christ and
us.</p>
            <p>§. 2. Therefore I think it most profitable
to answer this Question in such a manner as
shall tend not only to silence the Caviller, but
as may best satisfie such as doubt, and sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
men about the cause it self; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to be larger, than this Imposer desireth,
that I may be plain.</p>
            <p>§. 3. The fraud which this Quaerist is guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of is manifold, and manifest to any discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Reader. 1. In the choice of his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject:
For he knoweth (for it's easily known,)
that it hath not pleased God to make the
mysteries of our faith so evident, as things
sensible are; and that the difficulties which
are in and about the Christian cause, are
such, as give advantage to carnal unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
to find many words to say against it; and
that maketh it the hardest work of Preachers,
to convince unbelievers: or else the Gospel
had been received by more than the sixth
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50455:10"/>
part of the world, before this day. Now
these juglers would lay all the difficulties
which are in the Christian cause as such, upon
the <hi>Reformers</hi> cause alone, as if all this were
nothing to them, but the cause of Popery
were wholly free from them; or at least,
they could answer such questions better than
we can do. And so when such a fellow as
<hi>Hobbs,</hi> or <hi>Benedictus Spinosa</hi> in his <hi>Tractatus
Theologico-politicus,</hi> shall stretch their wits
to disgrace the Scripture and the Christian
cause, all this shall seem only to fall upon the
Protestants; whereas if we could not better
defend Christianity than the present princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Popery enable them to do, we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
that the Infidel were far hardlier answered
than any Sectary that we have to deal with.</p>
            <p>§. 4. 2. And his next fraud lieth in cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all the positive defence and proof on us,
that he may have nothing to do but assault
Religion, and manage the Infidels objections
against us. He offereth not to tell you him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
what their uniting certainty of Divine
Revelations is, and to make it good, but to
put <hi>you</hi> upon the <hi>proving task.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 5. 3. And his fraud is evident in the <hi>multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of Questions</hi> which he thrusteth <hi>together</hi>
into <hi>one;</hi> which any man of wit knoweth can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
have <hi>one answer;</hi> but must have <hi>many</hi> as
the Questions are <hi>many.</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:50455:11"/>
§. 6. 4. And yet he will oblige the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerer
to avoid <hi>[tedious discourses]</hi> that so
if his many questions have not <hi>one short an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,</hi>
he may have the evading pretence,
that <hi>It is a tedious discourse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 7. 5. And there is evident fraud in his
ambiguous terms; As his opposing <hi>matter of
fact</hi> only to <hi>matter</hi> of <hi>right,</hi> and so making
many heterogeneals to fall under matter of
fact; His confused and unexplained use of
the terms <hi>[Principle, Medium, determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nining,
Certainty, Vnity in faith,</hi> &amp;c.]</p>
            <p>§. 8. 6. Lastly, There is much fraud in his
many insinuated suppositions; As, 1. That
the Truth of this proposition that <hi>Whatsoever
God saith</hi> is <hi>true,</hi> &amp;c. is a <hi>matter of</hi> meer
<hi>right,</hi> as distinct from the rest mentioned as
matters of fact: 2. That the <hi>sense of the
words</hi> is a <hi>matter of fact</hi> as the <hi>truth</hi> of them
is not. 3. That Papists agree with us
that every Revelation of God is most certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
true. 4. That the <hi>Ebionites, Valentini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
&amp;c. who questioned the Scripture books
were Christians; 5. That these matters
have here a <hi>final</hi> determination. 6. That
this is necessary to Certainty and Unity
in the faith. By all which it appeareth that
this Question is intended, or used at least, as
a <hi>Soul-trap,</hi> and a <hi>Fool-trap.</hi>

§. 3. II. <hi>Matter of fact,</hi> is a phrase some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
used so largely as to signifie the Reality
of any Being, that is existent as such. But
ordinarily it signifieth something <hi>practised</hi> or
<hi>done</hi> as such: If he here take it in the first
sense, then the <hi>verity</hi> of this proposition
<hi>[Whatsoever God saith is True]</hi> is as much
<hi>matter of fact</hi> as the <hi>sence</hi> of that <hi>Proposition.</hi>
But if he mean the later, neither of them is
matter of fact. And yet he saith that the
said Proposition is matter of <hi>Right;</hi> As if
the <hi>Truth</hi> of a Proposition, and Gods Right
to be believed, were formally the same. And
yet he saith that the <hi>sense</hi> is matter of fact.</p>
            <p>§. 4. III. The word <hi>Certainty</hi> is very am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous:
Lest he complain of needless distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
I will only remember you, 1. That as
<hi>Certainty</hi> is <hi>Objective</hi> and <hi>Subjective,</hi> so it is
the <hi>Objective Certainty</hi> that we have here to
enquire of: But so as it is the <hi>means</hi> of <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective
Certainty.</hi> But withal to remember
that to Subjective Certainty (that we our
selves may be sure) there is need of much
more than Objective Certainty, <hi>viz.</hi> that
the soul and faculties be, 1. Rightly disposed:
2. And duly excited and applied, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Of Objective Certainty you must note,
that the word is sometimes taken for meer
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50455:13"/>
               <hi>Verity</hi> and <hi>Reallity;</hi> And so the word [In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible]
is used, for that which <hi>verily</hi> is, and
whosoever apprehendeth it so to be, is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.
And so all Truth is <hi>Certain</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Truth.</hi> But usually besides <hi>Truth,</hi> the
word <hi>Certainty,</hi> (and infallibility,) deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
the <hi>evidence</hi> of that Truth, by which
it is (not alwaies actually, but) aptitudinal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>notified</hi> to us.</p>
            <p>This <hi>evidence</hi> is either <hi>sensible,</hi> or <hi>Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible,</hi>
as the sense or the <hi>intellect</hi> is to be the
perceiver of it.</p>
            <p>Where you must distinguish the Physical
Evidence of the Thing or Incomplex Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
from the Logical Evidence of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex
Objects. And here between the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of self-evident Principles, and of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions
whose Evidence is derivative.</p>
            <p>But especially you must note wherein it is
that certainty of Intelligible evidence <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally
consisteth;</hi> which is in a certain <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree</hi>
of <hi>evidence:</hi> And 1. It is not every
low degree: For though all Truth be equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Truth, and infallible, so that no man is
deceived that receiveth it: yet we use not to
call that <hi>Certainty</hi> of <hi>evidence</hi> which is apt
only to give them some dark probability, and
leave the mind in hesitant doubtfulness.
2. And yet it is not only that degree of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
(which must help us to a <hi>perfect ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension,</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:50455:14"/>
which is to be called <hi>Certainty:</hi>
For then no man should be certain in this
world. For no man hath such a degree of
apprehension, but more may be added to
the <hi>clearness</hi> of it. 3. Therefore certainty
must be denominated from a middle degree;
which is, when the evidence is not only
True (for the confidentest apprehension of a
falshood is no certainty,) but also so Clear as
is apt to give a <hi>satisfying, quieting, resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
apprehension</hi> to the mind, yea though
it should be sometimes molested with some
doubts. 4. And therefore seeing such or
none is our <hi>certainty</hi> here, it followeth that
<hi>Certainty</hi> hath divers degrees, as the <hi>satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction</hi>
of the <hi>mind</hi> is <hi>more</hi> or <hi>less:</hi> And
that we are not equally certain of all that
we are certain of. You will find neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
use of these distinctions about this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie.</p>
            <p>§. 5. IV. And what he meaneth by
<hi>[Principle]</hi> I know not. 1. There is a
Physical or Hyperphysical <hi>Principle</hi> of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
and there is a <hi>natural</hi> principle of <hi>noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi>
and there is a <hi>Logical principle</hi> of
<hi>notification.</hi> 1. Our <hi>intellective faculties</hi>
are the <hi>natural apprehending principle.</hi> 2. The
<hi>spirit of God</hi> is the supream <hi>moving princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>
of Influx. 3. The intrinsick and adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50455:14"/>
               <hi>evidence</hi> of the thing in it self, is the
<hi>natural notifying</hi> principle: which is as va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
as things are. 4. The <hi>Premises</hi> as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
the conclusion are the <hi>Logical Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi>
of <hi>derivative</hi> certainty.</p>
            <p>§. 6. V. And I scarce know what he
meaneth by <hi>[Medium]</hi> he seemeth to take
it for the same with <hi>[Principle].</hi> There
are <hi>media essendi</hi> which I suppose he mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not (means to make us Articles of faith,
or to make them True); but rather the <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia
cognoscendi:</hi> But these are necessarily
more than one. 1. There are the <hi>media</hi> by
which we <hi>hear</hi> the <hi>word</hi> and receive the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
as it is. 2. There are the <hi>media</hi> by
which we come to understand—the <hi>sense</hi>
of the words. 3. There are the <hi>media</hi> by
which we know the difference between the
several parts of the Book, the more certain
and the more doubtful, and the different co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies
and readings, and the different transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
4. There are the <hi>media</hi> by which we
know that these Doctrines and these Books
are the same which were delivered to the
Churches by the Apostles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 5. There
are the <hi>media</hi> by which we know that Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
were wrought by Christ and his Apostles
and other Christians in confirmation of the
Gospel. 6. And there are the <hi>media</hi> by
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50455:15"/>
which we know that this Gospel and these
Books are true. And all these are not to be
confounded, by the simple pretence of calling
for a fixed <hi>medium or principle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 7. VI. <hi>[Determining]</hi> signifieth ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the <hi>private</hi> decision or determining of
doubts in the <hi>minds</hi> of particular persons;
or else the <hi>publick</hi> decision of doubts as they
are managed in the Church, by a publick
Judge. And this either as binding mens
Consciences or Minds what to believe, or
only as ruling their tongues, and actions, in
teaching and conversation.</p>
            <p>§. 8. VII. By <hi>[Vnity in faith]</hi> is
meant either unity in a <hi>general faith</hi> (which
they call <hi>Implicite,</hi>) or in a <hi>particular (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite)</hi>
faith: And that is either a unity in
all the essentials of Christianity, or also in
all the Integrals, or also in all the acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
which are revealed by God. And it is
either a secret unity of <hi>minds,</hi> or a publick
<hi>unity</hi> for communion that is meant.</p>

I am sure confusion is fit to deceive, but not

            <head type="sub">The rude and summary answer to the
confused Question.</head>
            <p>§. 1. LEst the Querist should pretend that
by distinguishing I avoid a plain
and direct answer to his Question, I will
here first suppose him to be as rude and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
as his Question would imply, and give
him such an answer as it will bear. But
so as that it cannot be satisfactory to a distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing
understanding, for whom therefore
I shall afterward answer more distinctly.</p>
            <p>§. 2. I cannot answer with common sense
in a narrower compass than by distinguishing
these Questions: 1. How know I the <hi>words</hi>
and <hi>Bible?</hi> 2. How know I that this Doctrine
and Book is the same, which was delivered
by the Apostles to the Churches? 3. How
know I the meaning of the words? 4. How
know I that this Doctrine and these words are
of God, (or a Divine Revelation)? 5. How
know I that they are true?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:50455:16"/>
§. 3. I. To the first Question I answer,
that I know that I hear and read the words,
and that this Bible containeth in it all its vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
contents, by my sense (my sight and
hearing) and my intellective perception of
things sensible. And though this be a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
in which the Papists agree not with us,
I am never the more in doubt, whether I see
and hear the words.</p>
            <p>§. 4. II. To the second, I know that this
Doctrine and Book is the same which by the
Apostles were delivered to the Churches, by
Infallible History; not such as dependeth on
the <hi>honesty</hi> of the speakers only, and so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth
but a humane faith; much less such
as depends on the bare Authority of the King
of <hi>Rome</hi> and his narrow selfish sect or party
and Kingdom; but by such History as hath
a certainty in it from <hi>natural principles,</hi> by
which we prove it impossible that there
should be deceit; there being so full a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
of all sorts of Christians, and ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
also, and infallible circumstantial evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
Even as I know that there was such a
man at <hi>Rome</hi> as <hi>Gregory</hi> 1. and <hi>Gregory</hi> 7.
and such persons in <hi>England,</hi> as <hi>Henry</hi> 8.
King <hi>Edward</hi> 6. Queen <hi>Mary.</hi> Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi>
&amp;c. And as I know that our Statute
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50455:16"/>
Books are not counterfeit: And as your Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
know that the Acts and Decrees of
Councils, the Works of <hi>Bellarmine, Baroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
&amp;c. are not counterfeit: which is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Pope or a General Council saith
so, but by <hi>rational evidence</hi> of <hi>certain Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,</hi>
which leaveth not mens minds in
doubt.</p>
            <p>§. 5. But I am not <hi>equally certain</hi> of some
questioned Books, or Readings, (no nor of
the sense of some difficult words) as I am <hi>of
all the rest,</hi> which being more evident are
more past controversie.</p>
            <p>§. 6. III. I know the meaning of the
words (spoken or written) as you know
the meaning of a man that talketh with you,
or of any other writings; as of your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
Decretals, Mass-book, <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> &amp;c.
that is, by the significance of such words by
humane usage from those daies till now,
which Lexicons, Books, and successive pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
fully prove.</p>
            <p>§. 7. But there are plain passages in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
which I understand certainly, (not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Pope saith This is the meaning:)
Such are all the essentials of Christianity and
abundance more. And there are difficult pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
which I am not certain of the sense
of.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:50455:17"/>
§. 8. IV. I know that this <hi>Doctrine</hi> and
the <hi>Bible</hi> containing it as such, are of God,
(or are his word,) by the <hi>spirit attesting</hi> and
fealing it; not in the fanatick sense, as they
think they have an inward impulse perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
them that so it is; (as some Papists
think the Pope and Councils know that to be
of God which they decree, by Prophetical
Inspiration:) But, 1. As to the Gospel, the
spirit attested it by antecedent Prophesie.
2. The image of Gods <hi>Power, Wisdom</hi> and
<hi>Goodness</hi> imprinted on the Scripture, is its es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential
constitutive evidence, being unimita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
by meer man, and that which is its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsick
self evidencing light: so that a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
well disposed soul, may from a sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness,
tast that it is Gods word; if a Bible
had come to them by chance and they had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
heard of it before. I say that they <hi>may</hi>
do so, if you can suppose them spiritually
disposed before: But if not, yet they may
strongly suspect that it is Gods word, when
they read that it affirmeth it self to be so, and
that the image of God upon it is so clear.
3. But the <hi>Concomitant Evidence</hi> of the <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>
maketh up the proof; in the miracles of
Christs Life, Resurrection and ascension;
and in the miracles of Apostles and primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Christians, abroad the world by which
the Gospel was fully sealed, 4. And the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:50455:17"/>
effected subsequent evidence of the spirit com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleateth
all the evidence; which is the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of holiness given by the means of this
same word to all true serious Believers in the
world in all ages and nations: which Holiness
is the Image of God himself, and is such a
gift as none but God can give, and as
God would not give by a Doctrine, which
he abhorreth as a lie. Therefore, 1. It wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth
objectively as an evidence; 2. And
it witnesseth <hi>effectively,</hi> by inclining the
heart to tast and close with and receive the
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the innaturalized word; as
life and health cause a man to know suitable
food, by a gust which proceedeth from a
suitable nature; so is it in the new nature
and the sincere milk of the word. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
though the intellect be the proper ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehender
of Truth as such <hi>suo modo,</hi> yet the
will is <hi>quaedam natura,</hi> and hath a natural
propensity to <hi>Good</hi> as <hi>Good,</hi> which is natural
to it, and is the <hi>pondus motuum</hi> in the ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
soul: And it is not an <hi>universal notion,</hi> or
<hi>nothing</hi> under the name of <hi>good</hi> which it
thus inclineth to; but <hi>existent good,</hi> in some
<hi>being</hi> that is, <hi>Vnum, Verum, Bonum,</hi> as <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi>
and other Scotists well prove. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it hath <hi>necessary volitions</hi> (as of its
own felicity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) which yet are free, and
not meerly <hi>per modum naturae,</hi> though na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50455:18"/>
as being <hi>ex sua natura.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this three or foursold witness or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation
of the spirit, (sometime <hi>Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi>
alwaies <hi>Constitutive, Concomitant,</hi>
and <hi>subsequent</hi>) though a holy soul that is
suited to it, and hath the witness in it self
may most fully and certainly discern, yet ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
also may discern; The Miracles being
Intelligible attestations to them, and the
beauty of <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Holiness</hi> in the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
and in the <hi>Saints</hi> being refulgent and
discernable by a stander by, though not as
by a possessor.</p>
            <p>§. 9. But I have not an <hi>equal Certainty</hi> of
all the parts of it, that they are the word
of God, because, 1. All the Books, Texts
and Readings are not brought to me with
equal historical Evidence. 2. And there
are abundance of passages in it which are but
Accidental to the Christian Religion which
have not the same self-evidencing luster in
them as the Essentials have. And there is
no Necessity of an equal knowledge of the
parts.</p>
            <p>§. 10. The parts which I am fully <hi>Certain</hi>
of in the Scripture are, 1. All the Essentials
of the Christian Religion; Because, 1. They
are delivered in Scripture <hi>frequently, plainly,
past all Controversie</hi> of which I will cite
your testimonies anon. 2. Because they
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50455:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
were as certainly delivered to all Christians
and Churches in the whole world distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by themselves, (twelve years before any
of the New Testament was written, and
above threescore and ten years before all of
it was written,) even in the Covenant of
Baptism, renewed in the Lords Supper, and
in the Creed, Lords Prayer and Decalogue,
which are the exposition of the Covenants,
professed by all Christians, in all Christian
Churches at every sacred meeting. And
these two waies of Tradition (in Scripture
and by themselves) are fuller than one.</p>
            <p>2. And all the rest of the holy Scriptures
in which the full concord of Copies, and the
plainness of the words doth leave no room for
rational doubting.</p>
            <p>§. 11. V. I know that all this word is
True, because God is True, <hi>(verax,)</hi> and it
is impossible for him to lie. For whoever
lieth, must want either <hi>Wisdom,</hi> to know
what to say, or <hi>Goodness</hi> to Love Truth, or
<hi>Power</hi> to make good his word, and attain his
will by better means. But God is perfect in
all these. Which you seem to grant us.</p>
            <p>§. 12. That all things necessary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
have been delivered by the Apostles to
the Churches two waies, as by two hands,
<hi>viz.</hi> Distinctly by word of mouth, and in
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50455:19"/>
the <hi>Bible,</hi> is our Doctrine. That more than
all in the Bible hath been delivered by word
of mouth, and this as necessary to the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of some men (I know not whom, who
have no more wit than to create necessity
to themselves,) is your Doctrine. But yet
your famousest contentious Doctors confess
that all things commonly necessary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
are plainly expressed in the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.</p>

God about which our Controversies lie?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> To mention no more, than I needs
must, there are three sorts of Revelation
which we assert and rest in: 1. Of Natural
Production and Evidence; such as is the
Light and Law of Nature, in the <hi>Nature</hi> of
all things, especially of man himself, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing
Gods will <hi>per modum signi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Infallible, Oral and Historical, Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
And so, 1. All the Covenant of Grace
in the Sacraments of Baptism and the Lords
Supper, with the Catechistical explanation
in the Creed, Lords-prayer and Decalogue,
have been particularly delivered by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
2. And so the Bible hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
to us in the bulks. 3. Written Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,
in the sacred Records of the Spirit,
which is the holy Scriptures themselves.</p>
            <p>§. 3. Of the first, more anon. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
they grant us so far as to confess,
1. That the said Covenant and Catechistical
Principles have had that way of delivery by
themselves, as well as in the Scripture: But
they tell of much more (I know not what)
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50455:21"/>
delivered the same way, than is in them, and
the Scripture it self. 2. Yet (as you see)
they confess that none of that addition is
commonly necessary to Salvation.</p>
            <p>The third they grant us (that all those
books which we receive are the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
word of God) But, 1. They say that
there are more; 2. And that we must receive
them as such, because the Pope and his
Council, as the only Judges, say they are
such. Of which more anon.</p>

            <head type="sub">Quest. II. Whether it be true that the
Papists grant us, that all Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations
are true?</head>
            <p>§. 1. <hi>Answ.</hi> YES, if you will first take
their bare word what are
Divine Revelations, 2. And will take in this
word <hi>[in the sense that God intends them]</hi>
3. And will allow them to speak contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
For thus, 1. They can tell you
when they have a mind, that Gods plainest
Revelations, are none of his Revelations.
2. And that whatever <hi>Evidence</hi> of <hi>truth</hi> or
<hi>sense</hi> there is in the <hi>signs revealing,</hi> God <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth</hi>
something contrary: 3. And that
that is his revelation which is contrary to
his Revelation.</p>
            <p>§. 2. For instance: The first fundamental
Revelation of God to man, is unto our <hi>sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
of things <hi>sensible,</hi> and thereby <hi>Intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to our understandings:</hi> Now we cannot
get the Papists assent that these Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations
are certainly true: yea, they say
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:50455:22"/>
that daily they are certainly false. God
made Sense: God made the Intellect: God
made the Medium, and God made the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.

<hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> by <hi>seeing, smelling, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
and <hi>tasting.</hi> Yet the Papists say, and
their Priests swear that there is no Bread
<hi>and Wine,</hi> and that God by another Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
hath certified us that this <hi>Revelation</hi>
to <hi>sense</hi> and the <hi>Intellect</hi> by sense is <hi>false:</hi>
He that will not swear that there is no Bread
shall be no Priest: He that will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
this Divine Revelation in Nature, and
all his senses, and all mens senses, is a Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
to be burnt and damned. All Temporal
Lords that will suffer such as thus renounce
not sense and sensible Revelation, are to be
excommunicate, and deprived of their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,
and their subjects absolved from
their oaths of allegiance. All this is in the
Council of <hi>Lateran sub Innoc. 3. Can.</hi> 1. 3.
And the <hi>Trent</hi> Oath and Council. Is this
now a Divine Revelation or not? If not,
then they that heard Christ speak and saw his
Miracles, and saw him after his Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
had none. For their senses might be
all deceived if all mens now may.</p>

§. 3. And if God intendeth here the quite
contrary to the Evidence, even of sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
natural signs, how can they ever prove
that he doth not so in his word too, even in
<hi>Hoc est corpus meum,</hi> and in every article of
the faith, Certainty lieth in <hi>Evidence,</hi> and
if all the declaring evidence may be false,
because of the contrary intent, then who
knoweth what is true? or whether ever God
said true to man?</p>
            <p>§. 4. And here Revelations are pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
against Revelation, yea the superstruct
against the fundamental, the consequent
against the antecedent, the less certain
against the more certain; yea certain forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
fathered on God, against his Certain Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Revelations. For, 1. We are <hi>men</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we are <hi>Christians;</hi> we have <hi>sense</hi> before
we have <hi>faith.</hi> We can have no certainty
of faith, but by <hi>means</hi> of the Certainty of
sense: For we cannot tell that there is any
man or book in the world, nor that ever we
saw a letter or heard a word. What then
shall we believe?</p>
            <p>2. And they have nothing but pretended
Miracles against this Constant Evident Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Revelation. For every Priest (how
sottish and wicked soever) to turn <hi>Bread</hi>
into no Bread and Wine into no Wine when
he list: For all the Priests in the world
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:50455:23"/>
these sixteen hundred years to do this every
week, or each day that they celebrate their
Mass, publickly or privately, must needs
be an undeniable Miracle (if true) being
as much beyond all natural power as raising
<hi>Lazarus</hi> from death: And to make these
miracles as universal, constant, and easie as
Gods worship in the Assembly, is to
turn Miracles into the familiarest of Gods
dealings: And hath not all this need of
good proof, to prove Gods natural Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to be as ordinarily and universally
false?</p>
            <p>3. Yea, the Miracle is doubled, while
the accidents remain: They deny them to
be the Accidents of Christs body and blood.
If they are Accidents then, it is either of
<hi>Bread</hi> or of <hi>Nothing:</hi> An Accident of Bread
which is no bread, the <hi>Quantity and Colour</hi>
of bread which is no bread, or of wine
which is no Wine, is a plain contradiction.
If they be the Accidents of nothing; the
<hi>Quantity</hi> of nothing, the <hi>weight</hi> of <hi>nothing,</hi>
the locality of nothing, the <hi>colour, tast,
smell</hi> of nothing, all these are as plain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions.
Then God must be said by his
Omnipotence to cause Contradictories, and
to work constant Miracles for that end, and
all to prove his Natural Revelation false.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:50455:23"/>
§. 5. And what cogent Evidence bringeth
them to all this? Why, <hi>Hoc est corpus meum;</hi>
No more than <hi>Davids [I am a worm and
no man]</hi> or Christs [<hi>I am the vine</hi> and <hi>ye
are the branches</hi>] and <hi>Pauls [that Rock
was Christ],</hi> Though <hi>paul</hi> becometh Christs
expositor, and three times in the three next
verses, 1 <hi>Cor.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 11. calleth it <hi>Bread</hi> after the
Consecration; And the old Fathers as often
as <hi>Edmundus Albertinus</hi> hath shewed in
folio. Yet because the foresaid <hi>Later an</hi> and
<hi>Trent</hi> Council have in the later end of the
world, new made this Article of the Papists
faith, by their exposition of Christs words
contrary to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> all Christs fore-revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in nature must go for falshoods, and
God daily worketh Miracles to deceive all
the common senses of the world, when yet
no word or Miracle can be believed, but on
supposition of the certainty of senses.</p>
            <p>§. 6. This, his blind supposition called me
to premise; that you may see how far Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
and we are or are not agreed that all
Gods Revelations are true? and how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
it is for them to know what is a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Revelation, or when Gods meaning is
agreeable to his Revelations. These are
things neer and plain and weighty.</p>

            <head>CHAP. VI.</head>
            <head type="sub">Quest. III. What Certainty we have
what is a real Revelation of God?</head>
            <p>§. 1. <hi>Answ.</hi> AS I have before partly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished
of Certainty, I
will now tell you as to some sorts, what it
is that goeth to make up <hi>Certainty,</hi> and
then how much and what of this we have.</p>
            <p>§. 2. I suppose you to remember that it
is not <hi>subjective Certainty</hi> (in our selves)
that we speak of, but <hi>Objective;</hi> which may
be at hand when men see it not. And that
it is not <hi>meer Truth</hi> which we now speak of,
but the <hi>Evidence</hi> of Truth, or its <hi>percepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,</hi>
and that neither the <hi>lowest, nor only
the highest degree,</hi> but <hi>any of the various de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees</hi>
which truly <hi>satisfie quiet</hi> and <hi>resolve</hi> the
soul.</p>
            <p>§. 3. And that Objective Infallibility or
Certainty, is 1. Not only that which <hi>decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
no man which receiveth</hi> it (for that's
the case of <hi>all truth</hi>) 2. Nor yet that which
<hi>no man can be deceived about</hi> (for that is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:50455:24"/>
at all, that I remember, unless it be
<hi>me cogitare, vel sentire.</hi>) 3. But it is that
which, in all its right conditions, may give
a man satisfactory, resolving certainty of
mind.</p>
            <p>4. To this is necessary, I. That the Thing
have intrinsecally the requisites of an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
II. That it have extrinsecally the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
concomitant conditions.</p>
            <p>§. 4. I. To the <hi>Nature</hi> of a <hi>perceptible
Object</hi> it is necessary; 1. That it be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
whose nature is within the reach of the
perceiving faculty, and not out of its orbe
(as spirits are to sense).</p>
            <p>2. That it have a perceptible degree, or
Magnitude: For the <hi>Minima rerum</hi> are not
perceptible to man.</p>
            <p>3. That it be <hi>Hoc aliquid,</hi> a distinct be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or <hi>unum</hi> as its called.</p>
            <p>4. That it have a special congruence to
the special perceiving faculty: For Light
must be seen and not <hi>heard,</hi> and so of the
rest. In a word, that it be <hi>Ens, Vnum,
Verum, Bonum,</hi> thus agreeably conditioned.
And the contraries reductively, or rather the
Propositions about them.</p>
            <p>§. 5. II. To the Accidents and Extrinsick
Conditions which go to make up Evidence,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:50455:25"/>
it is necessary, 1. That the Object have a
due Position or site. 2. That it have a due
distance, neither too far off, nor too near;
3. And a due <hi>Medium</hi> (as the <hi>air</hi> is to
the sight and hearing) 4. And a due abode
or stay; For neither sense perceiveth moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
perfectly swift, nor the Intellect things
absolutely instantaneous, that have no Time
of continuance.</p>
            <p>§. 6. Because <hi>Objective Certainty</hi> is Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
to <hi>Subjective,</hi> I must add what is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to that, I. On the part of sense, II. Of
the Intellect.</p>
            <p>I. To true sensible <hi>perception</hi> it is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
1. That the sensitive faculty of the soul
intend the business: Else the Organs will
be as a Lute not touched: as we see in hard
Students, that hear not the Clock at hand.
2. It is necessary that the spirits which are
actuated in sensation be present and suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for their part. 3. It is necessary that
the Organs be in a competent soundness.
4. It is necessary that it be the proper Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
that is used which agreeth with the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
(not the eye to hearing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) 5. That
the sense be not oppressed by Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:50455:25"/>
II. And further to Intellective percepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
1. Of things sensible; It is necessary,
1. That the thing be truly perceived by the
sense, 2. And truly Imagined, and therefore
that the Imagination have a Competent
soundness; 3. That the soul be Attentive to
to the matter, and not alienated: 4. That
the internal sense, Imagination and Sensitive-memory
be in a fit state of vicinity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
or union for the Intellect to operate
on and with them. 5. That the Intellect it
self be in act, according to its formal Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>
            <p>2. But to the Intellection of our own Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent
Acts of Intellection and Volition,
there is no more necessary but that <hi>such
Acts be;</hi> and then we can Intuitively per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
them.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>And by easie collection, the Intellect
without further help of sense can gather,
that [I that</hi> understand and will, am sure
I have a Power so to do: For nothing doth
that which it cannot do: And hereby I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
that there are Intellective Volitive
Agents, and what they are].</p>
            <p>§. 7. It is here supposed, that God hath
not a Voice to speak by as man hath; but
yet that he can cause a voice at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
either by the use of a creature, that
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:50455:26"/>
naturally hath a voice, or by the motion of
other creatures, a thousand waies, of which
it is not needful for us to be acquainted.</p>
            <p>§. 8. When God revealeth his mind, not
by voice, but by inward Inspiration, it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth
its own notifying Evidence with it,
which no man can formally conceive of, but
he that hath it; But this is the case of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical
persons only, and not of us.</p>
            <p>§. 9. In this Question, <hi>How to know that
a Revelation is of God?</hi> It is supposed that
the Revelation it self, that is, the <hi>notifying
sign,</hi> whether <hi>Voice, Writing,</hi> or other <hi>Act</hi>
or <hi>thing,</hi> be known already, For we must
first know that such a thing <hi>really is,</hi> before
we can know <hi>whence</hi> it is. And this is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
to be spoken of.</p>
            <p>§. 10. And here it is not enough to know
that God is some way a Cause of that Act,
Voice or Writing. For no doubt but he is
a universal cause at least, of all the <hi>Real be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi>
and <hi>actions</hi> in the world: But we must
be sure that he is the <hi>Determining Cause</hi> of
this <hi>special</hi> and <hi>individual act</hi> or <hi>thing</hi> as
such; so as that he may properly be called
<hi>The Author of it,</hi> and <hi>it</hi> be called His
<hi>work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 11. And here (Negatively) 1. We
have not <hi>sensible Evidence</hi> ascertaining us,
that these <hi>words</hi> or <hi>signs</hi> are the <hi>word</hi> of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:50455:26"/>
God. Sense is not the perceiver of this, as
it is of light, heat, motion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 12. 2. Therefore neither doth the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect</hi>
perceive it, by <hi>the sense,</hi> as it doth
these sensed things forementioned.</p>
            <p>§. 13. 3. Nor is it the object of <hi>Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Intellective Intuition,</hi> or known as we
know the acts of the soul it self, by Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
perception, as that we Think, Know,
Will, and Feel.</p>
            <p>§. 14. 4. Nor do we (alwaies at least)
know it as we do <hi>self-evident Principles,</hi>
which a man using Reason about them, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
choose but understand.</p>
            <p>§. 15. 5. Nor are all the Parts of Divine
Revelations, notified to us with <hi>equal Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,</hi>
nor altogether by the same <hi>media;</hi>
nor are they all of equal necessity to be
known to be Divine, and so to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
            <p>§. 16. But (Affirmatively) 1. We know
these Revelations to be Divine, as we know
the Truth of Conclusions, by Virtue of the
Evidence of their Premises. 2. And this
variously, as the Consequence is more or
less evident and certain.</p>
            <p>§. 17. 1. Supposing that we are Certain
that there is a God; (whether as a self-evident
Principle, or as the Certainest of
Conclusions) and so that he is Perfect, and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:50455:27"/>
therefore True, we are certain, as of a most
neer and Evident Conclusion, that all <hi>Gods
Works</hi> are his <hi>Revelations</hi> to man (which
are within our reach): that is, That they
are signs by which God Revealeth Himself
and his Will to us: The Glass in which he
must here be seen: The Divinity of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Revelation is past doubt: But all the
doubt is of the <hi>sense</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>§. 18. 2. <hi>There are Naturally Evident
Verities in the Scriptures, which upon the
first considerate hearing we may be sure
are true: As that</hi> there is a God, that he is
One, that he is Infinite, Perfect, most Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
Wise and Good, the Beginning, Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
and End of all things; that he is our
Owner, Actor, Ruler, Benefactor and End:
That we ought to Love him, Please and Obey
him, above all others, with all our hearts
and Powers. <hi>The whole Body of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Law of Nature is there conteined;
and so is known by a double Revelation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 19. 3. There are other points which are
so greatly congruous to the common experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of mankind, as that they have also a
Certainty in the thing from that experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
As the common pravity of mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and the great necessity that we have of
Deliverance by Pardon and Sanctification;
the malice and endeavour of Devils or evil
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:50455:27"/>
spirits to tempt us from God, and destroy
us; the need of Gods continual help against
them and our selves, with such like. And
these also we have a double Revelation
of.</p>
            <p>§. 20. 4. The Principal part of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural
Revelations, are so exceeding
congruous to those which are of <hi>Natural</hi>
and <hi>Experienced</hi> Certainty, and are so aptly
adjoyned to them, and have so Divine a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
and tendency apparent in them, as that
they are the more easily believed.</p>
            <p>§. 21. 5. And the main frame of the book
hath so much of the same spirit and design,
and is adapted to the Communication of these
principal parts (that is, the Essentials of
Christianity) and thereto so compagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated,
as that the Belief of the said Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials,
maketh it the more easie to believe
that the whole system of books is of God.</p>
            <p>§. 22. 6. But where we are uncertain of
any thing whether it be really a part of that
book or system (as some questioned Books,
some various Readings, some Texts whose
sense is not understood) we must needs be
equally uncertain whether those be the <hi>word
of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 23. 7. But that Medium which <hi>ascer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth</hi>
us that these supernatural Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are indeed Divine (I mean the proper
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:50455:28"/>
Truths of Christianity) must be something,
which is Lower, or is <hi>Notius &amp; prius cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitum,
better known</hi> than Christianity, and
known (in order of Evidence) before it.
For all proof of conclusions must be from
something <hi>first</hi> and <hi>better known.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 24. 8. These things which are <hi>sooner</hi>
and <hi>better</hi> known than the supernatural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,
can be nothing but <hi>Natural Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,</hi>
by Gods works in the Nature of
things compared, and our natural experience.
For there is nothing else antecedent to be a
<hi>medium</hi> of proof. The forementioned natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Verities, about <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Holiness</hi> carry
their own Evidence with them, either as first
principles or as certain conclusions; And
the <hi>Essentials</hi> of <hi>Christianity</hi> have a <hi>self-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
Goodness,</hi> which rendreth them
<hi>sweet</hi> to a man that is already a true Believer,
and <hi>desireable to all</hi> truly rational men, and
the Congruencie rendreth it credible, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
further proof. But that really the
Incarnation, Deity, Life, Satisfaction, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,
Ascension, Offices and Coming
of Christ, are truth, with the Trinity of
persons, and such other points, must be
proved by some more notorious <hi>Medium,</hi>
proving that they are Divine assertions;
which must be some Natural Verities.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:50455:28"/>
§. 25. 9. Therefore the Ascertianing Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
must be this, that If this be not a
<hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> then some <hi>Certain Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Verity</hi> must be <hi>denied;</hi> (which at
last will amount to the denying of a
God.)</p>
            <p>§. 26. 10. <hi>Here the Matter of fact is
supposed to be known by</hi> sight <hi>and other
senses to the first Christians, and the first
Churches, where Christ and his Apostles,
and multitudes of other Christians wrought
them. And to be known by Certain Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
to those that saw them not; And the
existence of the Persons, Words and Books
is supposed known the same way. And on
this supposition, we infer that</hi> [These Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
of Divine Power, Wisdom and
Goodness, set upon this Doctrine: and all
these Miracles by Christ, and multitudes of
his servants wrought, in attestation of it,
and all this sanctification of all true Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
by this word through the world, are
either done by Gods will, or against his
will. If they be done by his will, he is the
Author of them and approver: And seeing
it is evident that they are to the common
capacity of mankind, so notorious a signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
that God is the Author or approver
of that word which be so evidently and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
attesteth, if yet this word prove
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:50455:29"/>
false, mankind is unavoidably deceived,
and Governed in the greatest concernments
and business of all his life by this deceit.
For he hath no principle, no means left
him to know that these are not Divine at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations,
nor to disoblige him from judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them so to be. But if God shall thus
necessitate mankind to a false belief and
thereby Govern him, while in Nature he
hath taught man to value Truth and hate
Lying, he must do this either for want of
Power to do otherwise, or for want of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to do otherwise, or for want of Will
and Goodness to do otherwise. And if he
wanted any of these he is not God. Or if
he Govern not the world himself, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
some Evil Spirit to do all this; he is
not God. For to be God is to be the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Governor, and to be every where,
the nearest universal Agent.]</p>
            <p>These consequences being plain, (though
there are vain Objections which I must not
stay to answer) we certainly infer: There
is a God who is the perfect Governour of
the world, and therefore is Gracious, <hi>True</hi>
and <hi>Iust;</hi> and therefore doth not rule even
the best of men by unavoidable deceit and
falshood: and therefore this word is True
which he so notoriously owneth and attest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
as aforesaid.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:50455:29"/>
§. 27. And hence it is that we take our
selves bound about the Sacrament to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi>
that all mens senses are not deceived;
because if they be, man hath no remedy:
For God hath made our sense the perceiver
of things sensible; and if it be not a <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
perceiver,</hi> we have no <hi>Certainer</hi> nor
<hi>other</hi> about those objects. And if the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
of sense be uncertain, (having
all the natural requisites) then all Gods
<hi>Miracles</hi> by which he attested the word,
(as well as the word it self) are so: And
if it be not contrary to Gods perfection,
Veracity and Justice, to deceive all mens
senses in the Sacrament, we cannot prove
it contrary to them to deceive them by Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.</p>
            <p>§. 28. As an unbeliever is not so well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposed
to receive the Gospel as a holy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
after is, and <hi>recipitur ad modum reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pientis;</hi>
so usually a more wavering belief
goeth before a fuller Certainty: And the
<hi>holier and more experienced any man is,</hi>
the more he is <hi>Certain</hi> of the truth of the
Gospel, because he hath the witness in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,

§. 29. The holy Scripture Containing
all the Divine Revelations belonging to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
compleatly, Essentials, Integrals and
Accidentals; the parts of it are not of <hi>equal
necessity</hi> to us. All that truly have the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentials
in Head and Heart and Life, shall
be saved: yea though culpably they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
not other points as plainly revealed, and
so believe them not to be Divine. For this is
the Covenant of Grace: No wonder then
if many less necessary parts are less evident.</p>
            <p>§. 30. We have a fuller Evidence that all
these Miracles, Prophesies and subsequent
operations of the Sanctifying Spirit, do at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
the New Covenant, and Substance of
the Gospel, than we have that they attest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
every book, (e.g. the Chronicles, the
Canticles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) or that they attested every
phrase, method, yea or the truth of every
word of the penmen, so as that none of them
could through oversight or forgetfulness,
misrecite a name, number or circumstance.
Though we have here sufficient satisfaction,
yet not so full a Certainty as we have of
the Doctrine of the Gospel, which the
Apostles converted the world by Preaching
of, before the New Testament was written;
and which in the Sacramental Covenants,
the Creed, Lords Prayer and Decalogue
and Catechisms, was distinctly by it self de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered

(save that the Recorded Originals of

            <p>§. 2. 1. They are delivered to us by men

the Copies agree.</p>
            <p>§. 3. 2. They were constantly read in the

            <p>§. 4. 3. The Copies all over the world,
of Greatest antiquity, still agree so far as is

agree: which the Old Translations also
Confirm.</p>
            <p>§. 5. The words in which they disagree,
though many, are such as no article necessary

the errors of Scribes, and not of the holy

            <head type="sub">Quest. V. What Certainty have we of
the Canonical Books.</head>
            <p>§. 1. <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. OF all those Canonical
Books which the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
world now commonly receiveth, there is
the same Certainty by the same means,
which I before mentioned of the Copies.
The <hi>Doctrine</hi> of them was spoken of before,
it being that Divine Revelation which God
hath attested as was opened. We have the
Certain History and Tradition of all ages
from the first common notice and reception
of them, agreeing which are the true Books.</p>
            <p>§. 2. 2. But yet even of these Canonical
Books agreed on, the Evidence of Divinity
is not equal. For, 1. Some of them have.
more <hi>Evident Impressions</hi> of Gods Image up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them in the Matter than others have
(As the <hi>Psalms</hi> more than <hi>Ruth,</hi> the <hi>Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles,</hi>
&amp;c. The Doctrinal Books more than
the Genealogies, Chronologies, particular
Histories,) 2. God did confirm some more
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:50455:32"/>
notoriously by Miracles and publick attesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
than others: So <hi>Moses</hi> his words, had
more confirmation by Miracles than <hi>Ruth,
Chronicles, Ecclesiastes, Canticles,</hi> &amp;c. 3. Some
have had a fuller testimony by Tradition than
others; As the Pentateuch and Psalms, more
than the <hi>Chronicles,</hi> part of <hi>Daniel,</hi> &amp;c.
4. In all these respects, <hi>the New Testament</hi>
cometh to us with fuller and clearer Evidence
than the Old: As being of later date, and
so the Historical proof more discernible;
And hath more clear Impressions of Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and was confirmed by the most notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
multiplied long-continued Miracles, and
by the most notable effects of holiness in
all true Believers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And indeed its at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation
to the Old Testament is not our
weakest proof of its Divinity.</p>
            <p>§. 3. There is less doubt of those few books
of the New-Testament, which were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
or doubted of but by some Churches
for a time, than of those which are contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
as belonging to the Old.</p>
            <p>§. 4. As to those Books which he saith
the <hi>Ebionites</hi> and <hi>Valentinians</hi> denied, they
have as full Historical proof as any; And
those that denied them denied Christs Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
or some Essentials of Christianity, and
were no Christians, but mad-brained facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
withdrawn from Christians, (the <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinian
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:50455:32"/>
Gnosticks</hi> in their whole heresie,
plainly shewed themselves crackt-brained Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticks,
as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius</hi> describe
them,) so that for Number, Quality and
Cross-interest their Exceptions were not
any considerable discredit of the History;
and indeed but excite the Christians the more
carefully to examine and preserve their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non:
Nor were their exceptions so much
against the Matter of Fact (whether <hi>Mark,</hi>
&amp;c. wrote those books,) as about the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of them: And were but of the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
with all the Turks, Heathens and other
Infidels exceptions against the whole Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</p>
            <p>§. 5. And as for those Apocryphal books
which are in Controversie between the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
and us, some Protestants say that they
are <hi>Certainly</hi> none of Gods word, and some
that it is <hi>utterly uncertain to any</hi> man that
they are his word: And let the Papists who
assert the <hi>Certainty that they</hi> are, give us
the proof of it, and we will thank them.
Till then our <hi>denial</hi> or <hi>uncertainty</hi> of those
books, maketh no alteration in the <hi>Great</hi>
and Necessary Articles of our faith.</p>

the truth of Translations.</head>
            <p>§. 1. <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. THose that understand
the Original and the
Language into which it is Translated; have
a Certainty from the Known signification of
the words, answerable to the degree of their
skill in those tongues. The signification of
the <hi>words</hi> is Certain to them by Infallible
Tradition. The use and sense of the words
in Hebrew and Greek is known by Lexicons,
and the constant use of Authors, and by the
confession of all parties, friends and Enemies,
and by present use: so that as your Priests
understand a true Translation of any Latine,
Greek or Hebrew Author, (<hi>Cicero, Plutark,
Demosthenes, Antonine, Maimonides,</hi> &amp;c.)
by the same means do the Learned know a
true Translation of the Bible.</p>
            <p>§. 2. In the Essentials of Christianity,
and all the necessary Articles of faith, the
Ignorant themselves have an Infallible Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:50455:33"/>
that the Translations are true, so far
as that all that is necessary to Salvation is
contained concordantly in them all. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it hath pleased God to deliver all those
<hi>Necessary points,</hi> in various words, distinctly
by themselves by all Baptizers and Pastors
of the Churches, as is aforesaid: With
which the Scripture Translations do agree.
2. Because there is a <hi>natural Impossibility</hi>
that men of so various minds and interests
as all the Translators, and all the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of those Translations, should agree till
this day to deceive the world, and not be
discovered.</p>
            <p>§. 3. And by the same evidence it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to an unlearned man, that all other plain
points in which the Translators agree, are
truly translated: Though the knowledge of
it in lesser points is not so necessary.</p>
            <p>§. 4. And thus (and no other way) both
unlearned Protestants and Papists, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
read, must know that there is a Bible
in the world, and that the Priests do ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
read truly that publickly read it to
them, and that there are Canons of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
in the world, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Because it is not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
for so many men of cross interests to
agree in feigning it, without detection.</p>
            <p>§. 5. There are some passages in some
Translations so palpably distorted to the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:50455:34"/>
Translators interests and ends, as that the
Text and Context to the Learned, and the
common agreement of the world to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned,
may notifie the error.</p>
            <p>§. 6. There are many passages or words
so difficult, about which Translators differ
as that few or none are Certain which of
them is in the right. And this uncertainty
is of no danger to the Church or to mens
souls.</p>

            <head type="sub">Quest. VII. What Certainty have we
of the true sense of the Text.</head>
            <p>§. 1. <hi>Answ.</hi> THis Question is partly
the same with the former;
For to Translate is to give the sense of the
original, in other words. The sense is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
1. The sense of <hi>single terms;</hi> 2. Or
the sense of <hi>propositions and sentences,</hi>
3. Or the sense of <hi>many sentences</hi> conjunct
in <hi>Method.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 2. The first is known to Translators
as is aforesaid; As you know the sense of
all words of all languages; by common usage
and common Tradition.</p>
            <p>The second is made up of the first by
common reason; As a sentence is made up
of common words. He that understandeth
what these words <hi>[Repentance]</hi> and <hi>[is]</hi>
and <hi>[necessary]</hi> signifie; may know without
a Pope, what this sentence signifieth <hi>[Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
is necessary].</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:50455:35"/>
The same is to be said of divers sentences
conjunct. The sense is known by the way
that men learn to talk and to understand one
anothers speeches. And as you understand
<hi>Baronius, Bellarmine,</hi> the Councils, or any
of your Priests; even by the common ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of words, and reason setting them
together, as man from his Infancie is taught
to reason.</p>
            <p>§. 3. But as Infants understand not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
talk till they are taught, nor children
and untaught persons so well as men and
Scholars; so the plainest things in Scripture
require some use and consideration, and
Teaching to the understanding of them:
Much more the harder parts. And God hath
made it the duty of Parents to teach the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
to their children at home and abroad,
lying down and rising up, <hi>Deut. 6. &amp;</hi> 11.
without asking the Pope the sense of it:
And God hath appointed the elder and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
to teach the younger and more ignorant,
and especially Pastors and Teachers, to teach
the world, and instruct their flocks, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the word of God. Not barely to
rest in their opinion and words, but to shew
men the same Evidence which doth convince
themselves. Which Teaching is not a <hi>final
Iudging.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:50455:35"/>
§. 4. But yet where the Teacher knoweth
what the Learner doth not, the Learner must
have the humility of a Disciple, and not set
his untaught wit conceitedly against his
Teacher, and wrangle before he understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;
but must judge his Teacher (whether
it be Grammar, Logick, or Theologie, words
or sense, that he Teacheth him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
than himself. Else why will he be his
Scholar? And so he must believe him as a
fallible man, with a humane faith, in order
to his attaining of a proper Certainty.</p>
            <p>§. 5. But there are in Scripture many pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
so exceeding difficult, that we have no
Certainty of the sense; And some that only
a few extraordinary Students have a Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of; neither Protestants nor Papists
further understanding them. And this is no
disparagement to the Scripture, nor hazard
or injury to us.</p>

be expected to be conserved by our

            <p>§. 1. HEre are two Questions for haste in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded:
I. What Unity in faith
may be expected? II. What Certainties are
necessary thereto.</p>
            <p>§. 2. I. To the first, 1. A Unity in all the
<hi>Essentials</hi> of the Christian faith, is already
existent among all Christians in the world;
For they were not Christians if they agree
not in all Essentials of Christianity.</p>
            <p>§. 3. 2. <hi>A Vnity</hi> of faith in the <hi>Integrals</hi>
of Christianity is desireable, and so far hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
as that the wiser all Christians are, in
the more of the Integrals they will agree.</p>
            <p>But here will never be an universal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
or Unity, any more than in mens age,
strength, Stature and complexions: This
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:50455:36"/>
               <hi>Paul</hi> openeth at large, 1 <hi>Cor. 12. &amp; Rom. 14.
&amp;</hi> 15, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>§. 4. 3. A <hi>perfect Vnity</hi> in the common
knowledge of all things in Scripture, or all the
revealed Accidentals of Religion, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be found between any two persons in
this life; because that no ones knowledge is
perfect.</p>
            <p>§. 5. II. From hence the other Question
is easily answered. 1. To a Unity of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi>
as Christians, or the body of Christ
and Church Universal, and of necessity
to Salvation, no Certainty is necessary but
of the Essentials of the Christian Religion.</p>
            <p>2. To the more Comfortable progress,
and the <hi>melius esse</hi> of Christians and the
Churches, as great a Concord and Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in the Integrals of Christianity is needful,
as the <hi>degree</hi> of <hi>melius esse</hi> doth require.</p>
            <p>3. To mens peaceable and comfortable
Communion in Christian Societies, an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and consequently knowledge of the points
of Christian Love and holy communion is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.</p>
            <p>4. To our Heavenly Union, Heavenly
perfection is necessary.</p>
            <p>§. 6. But to insinuate that a Certainty of
the sense of all the Scripture, or all that God
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:50455:37"/>
hath revealed to us Objectively, or of all
that Popes and Councils determine, is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to that unity of faith, which maketh
all Christians to be Christians, and one body
of Christ, is but a cheating trick, which is
against Scripture, reason and their own

to this Certainty and Unity.</head>
            <p>§. 1. <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. GOds Determination of
the Object, by <hi>Verity</hi> and
<hi>Evidence,</hi> and his helping the faculty in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining
it self in act, is necessary.</p>
            <p>§. 2. 2. The inward true Determination
of every mans own perceiving faculty, (sense
and Intellect) is necessary to his true per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.</p>
            <p>§. 3. 3. A Parent, Schoolmaster, Senior,
and Pastor, must tell the Scholar their own
Judgement, and then open to him the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of truth.</p>
            <p>§. 4. A Magistrate or other Superiour
(Parent, Master, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) hath a determining
Judgement, under God and his Laws, in order
to the ends of their proper Government; and
no further. That is, They are the only pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Judges in their Society, who shall be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
or not punished by the sword; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:50455:38"/>
or encouraged, as teaching false
Doctrine or true. But this is not an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
and unregulated power. If they deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
contrary to Gods word, they sin,
and bind not me to obey them though I am
bound to continue my subjection, and not to
resist.</p>
            <p>§. 5. Even so it is with Pastors in the
Church, who have power to try particular
mens cases, and judge them according to Gods
word, and that only in order to the ends of
their Society, which is holy Communion in
Love.</p>
            <p>§. 6. But this much power (as it supposeth
the sense of the Law, and declareth it only
as far as the decision of the particular case
requireth, and not an Universal Regulating
determination which hath the nature of an
Universal Law it self, so) it belongeth to
none but true Pastors of the Church, and
that only within their proper charge: And if
any one will do as the Pope, who will be
Ruler in all Churches of the world, his
usurpation maketh him a sinner, but not an
obliging determiner.</p>
            <p>§. 7. And thus you have our Answer to all
his Questions, which he thrust into one, as
plainly and distinctly as I can well speak.
And because his snare lieth in putting you on
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:50455:38"/>
the deciding of all these cases, while he doth
nothing to it himself, that so he may <hi>destroy</hi>
where he cannot build, and so would make
the world believe that they have a greater
<hi>Certainty</hi> in all the cases propounded than we
have, I will next try <hi>their Certainty</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with ours and shew you the difference;
And withal I will tell you why we use not
their <hi>Medium</hi> and take it not for any Certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
at all.</p>
            <p>§. 8. But withall professing that if I knew
where to find that Man or company of men
that I could be sure could Infallibly certifie
me of all the doubts and difficulties in the
matters of faith, it would save me such abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of labour in my long studies, and so
gratifie my love of ease, and my earnest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
of the greatest Certainty in these greatest
things, that I would spare no possible labour
and cost to find out such an Oracle: And I
wonder not that slothful men had rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
that others (by number or prerogative)
are <hi>Certain,</hi> and so to trust upon a common
faith, than to search and pray till they have
a Certainty of their own.</p>

their Impudency and Designs are such, as
that nothing of this must be considered
(though they are referred to it,) but they
must lay snares for souls, by canting over
the same things, and calling out for that
Answer which they will not take notice of
when it is before them, some more they
shall have, for the sake of those whom they
would deceive: But in great brevity lest
I tire the Reader by repetitions of things
that have been so often said.</p>
            <p>§. 2. <hi>Though the Papists are disagreed
greatly among themselves in this matter,
yet the most prevailing opinion is, that it
is upon the</hi> Authoritative Determination of
the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> and a General Council
if he approve it, that all Christians in the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:50455:40"/>
world must have the Certainty what is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the word of God: And men must take
all for Certain which is so determined of,
and no more: even because this Authority
hath so determined: And that this is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
by the common certain faith of the
Church, when otherwise men must have but
an uncertain private faith of their own:
And consequently that he that will convince
an Infidel and convert he world, must
first make them believe that the Pope and
Council are Authorised or Enabled, to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
judicially <hi>(and not only to Teach by
Evidence)</hi> what is Gods word and what
not, before any thing can be Certainly taken
for Gods word]</p>
            <p>§. 3. The difference between the Papists
opinion and ours, for brevity sake, shall be
included in our Reasons against their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Certainty: which are these.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reason</hi> I. We have <hi>another Certainty</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
by notorious Evidence of many things
in your present Question. And must we
quit all that Certainty, to take the same things
only on trust from your Pope and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil?
We cannot do it; Because some evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
is Cogent, and the Intellect is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitated
by it: Must we not know that <hi>[Thou
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:50455:40"/>
shalt Love God and thy neighbour]</hi> is Gods
word, by its proper Evidence? We have
the witness within us; we see on all true
Christians that Holiness wrought by this
Gospel, which God will not use a lie to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
(even to save men from sin, and reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the hearts of men to himself, and repair
his Image on mans soul). Must I needs give
the lie to this Evidence till the Pope speak.
He that <hi>Loveth God</hi> may be sure by inward
perception (yea Intuition if <hi>Ocham</hi> say true)
that he Loveth him; and consequently is
beloved of him; and this Gospel wrought
it. Must I not know that <hi>[He that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
shall be saved]</hi> is truly translated out
of the Original, till the Pope determine it?
Must I believe no Grammar, no Lexicon,
no Antient Author, no Jew, no Teacher of
Greek or Hebrew, no vulgar use, concerning
the sense of words till the Pope determine
it? Must I not know what the Baptismal
Tradition of all Christians in the world
doth tell me, that <hi>we must believe in God
the Father, Son and Holy Ghost</hi> till I know
that the Pope determineth it? Must I not
receive the Creed, Lords-Prayer, or Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
by all other Evidence till his word
cometh in? Then I must throw away Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
for uncertainty?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:50455:41"/>
II. Your own party do not thus receive all
in your Question. They teach and learn
the Hebrew and Greek Grammars, and the
Rules of Translating, and Criticize upon
the Text, and search after the Copies to
discern the best by intrinsick Characters,
and by comparing them, as any man may
see who readeth all your Gramarians, Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
and Commentators: And yet must we
know Translations and Copies only by the
Popes determination?</p>
            <p>III. Your own Popes <hi>ex Cathedra</hi> have
given the Church various Translations: That
Edition of the Vulgar Latine made by <hi>Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
5.</hi> and that made about two years after
<hi>Clemens</hi> 8. differ in so many hundred passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and abundance of whole verses and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
that if a Bible be a Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
one of them shamefully erred about
Divine Revelations, or <hi>de fide.</hi> See Dr.
<hi>Iames</hi> his <hi>Bellum Papale,</hi> and its Defence
against <hi>Gretser.</hi> Where then is your Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty?</p>
            <p>IV. You are utterly uncertain and disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
among your selves, who it is that
hath this <hi>Ascertaining Determining Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:50455:41"/>
You say it is your Church: But some say
that the Infallibility and Power is in the
Pope alone, <hi>in Cathedra.</hi> Some say it
is a General Council though the Pope dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent:
Some say that the Pope and Council
must agree: and some say that the Church
Essential of all Countries must receive the
decrees before they are infallibly ascertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
And who can be Certain of Gods
word by an Authority which is it self so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain?
See the proof in <hi>Safe Relig.</hi> p. 192,
193, 194.</p>
            <p>V. Your own sentence condemneth your
own Judges as uncertain: General Councils
(as <hi>Constance</hi> and <hi>Basil</hi>) have concluded
that Popes may err in matters of faith: yea
accused and Condemned them as Hereticks, if
not Infidels. And shall we not believe a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Council in matter of present fact, and yet
must believe them what is Gods word? And
that one Council hath Condemned another,
and Popes have Condemned Councils, I have
<hi>ibid.</hi> proved at large. And if Popes and
General Councils distinct are deceitful, how
shall we be sure that two false parties when
they meet do make one true one?</p>
            <p>VI. Popes and General Councils have
often erred from the faith (as our Church
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:50455:42"/>
of England truly asserteth): and therefore
we are not sure that they never will do so
more. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himself noteth about
fourty Popes charged with error or Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie.
<hi>Liberius</hi> subscribeth the sentence against
<hi>Athanasius,</hi> and received the Arrians to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
and subscribed the Sirmian faith,
<hi>Hane ego libenti animo suscepi in nullo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicens:</hi>
See his <hi>Epist. 7. in Binnius To. 1.
p.</hi> 465. and his notes on it. See more in my
<hi>safe Relig. p. 249, &amp;c.</hi> And of Councils,
<hi>p.</hi> 274, &amp;c. The sixth General Council at
<hi>Constantin.</hi> approved by Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> and
by the seventh Council, hath many errors,
as have many others there instanced in. What
Certainty then can they give us?</p>
            <p>VII. The Ancient Christians and
Churches received not the Certainty of their
faith upon the Authoritative determination
of a Pope and Council. Therefore there
is a Certainty to be had without it. The
Churches that Paul or any Apostle Convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
believed not at first upon the Authority
of a General Council, nor of a Pope. Till
the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> for above 300. years
the world was without a General Council:
And were they without faith? <hi>Frumentius</hi>
and <hi>Aedesius</hi> that preached to the Indians and
all other Christian Preachers that then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:50455:42"/>
souls took another course. They did
not first convince men of the Authority of a
Pope and General Council to tell them what
was Gods word, before they brought them
to believe it.</p>
            <p>VIII. Scripture it self never mentioneth
this Method or Evidence: And would it
be silent of the only way of Certainty? It
never saith to the world [You must know
by the Judgement of <hi>Peter,</hi> or the Pope and
a General Council what is the word of God]
Did Christ forget it?</p>
            <p>IX. The Ancient Defenders of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Faith did all go another way: <hi>Iustin,
Tertullian, Athenagoras, Tatianus, Minutius
Faelix, Arnobius, Lactantius, Eusebius</hi> in his
two first Volumes <hi>de Praepar. &amp; Demonstrat.
Augustine,</hi> and all such writers, seek to prove
our faith by other Evidence, and never say
[<hi>the Pope and a General Council are the
only ascertaining declarers</hi> of it.]</p>
            <p>X. Our Proof of the Matters of fact is
incomparably more certain than yours: For,
1. As to the Power of Judging, we main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
a concurrence of the peoples <hi>Discerning
Iudgement,</hi> the <hi>Pastors Teaching</hi> or <hi>Direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Iudgement,</hi> and both <hi>Magistrates</hi> and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:50455:43"/>
               <hi>Pastors</hi> Deciding and Governing Judgement,
not to be the only Determiner of mens minds
<hi>de fide,</hi> but to Rule the publick Doctrine
and Communion of the Church according
to Gods foreknown Laws. And as to the
Truth of Copies, Miracles, and the actual
delivery of the Gospel in the Scripture, and in
the distinct Catechistical Articles aforesaid,
we rest on <hi>Tradition</hi> which hath a <hi>Natural
Infallibility,</hi> and not a pretended <hi>Authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Iudge. Your Tradition</hi> receiveth its credit
from <hi>pretended Power to Iudge,</hi> which all the
wise men in the world will deny till its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
<hi>Our Tradition</hi> hath its credit from a
<hi>Natural Impossibility</hi> that the <hi>History should
be false.</hi> I have shewed you the proof of
this in my <hi>More Reasons</hi> for the <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Religion</hi> and else where: If you will not
read them there, I know not whether you
will read them here, and therefore will not
write them again. <hi>We</hi> have <hi>all your Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
which is <hi>Evidence indeed,</hi> and <hi>far
more with it;</hi> And as <hi>Hierom</hi> saith, <hi>The
world is more than the City. Your Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
is that of a <hi>Popes judging Power only</hi> as
some say; and of a <hi>Pope with his Council</hi> as
others say; and of the Pope with his <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi>
as your few moderate Latitudinarians
say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> You are not above the third or fourth
part of the Christian world: If you deny
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:50455:43"/>
this, your Impudent lying may cheat a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
that never read the state of the world,
but will shame you the more with learned
men: And is not the Tradition, 1. Of all
the Christian world for 300. years before
there was any General Council, 2. And of
all the Christian world since (even Greeks,
Armenians, Syrians, Copties, Abassines,
and all others) more than the Tradition of
a Pope and a few inslaved Priests? The
Council of <hi>Trent</hi> had for a considerable
time but 42. Bishops, even when it set up
your Tradition as a supplement to Scripture.
And is the Pope and these 42. of equal histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
credit to all the Christian world?</p>
            <p>3. Yea our <hi>History</hi> takes in <hi>Hereticks,</hi> yea
and <hi>Infidels</hi> and <hi>Heathens</hi> too so far as they
have left us any Testimony of these things.
Even a <hi>Pliny,</hi> a <hi>Celsus,</hi> a <hi>Porphyry,</hi> a <hi>Iulian,</hi>
and any other the bitterest Enemies: Because
we prove it Impossible that so many men of
different Countries, and no converse, and
contrary minds and Interests, should confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
or agree to deceive the world, and be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>detected
in such a matter. And what is
the Pope and 42. or two hundred Prelates
(most of <hi>Italy</hi>) to such Historical Evidence
as this?</p>
            <p>O that you could lay by partiality and base
selfish respects but for one day or hour?
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:50455:44"/>
What if the Question among us were
whether ever <hi>Paul</hi> was at <hi>Rome?</hi> Or <hi>Iustin</hi>
wrote his Apologie? Or <hi>Origen</hi> was a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
Christian? Or <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great
professed Christianity? Or whether the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of <hi>Iustin, Tertullian, Cyprian, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine,</hi>
&amp;c. be true or spurious, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do you think that the Intrinsick and
Extrinsick Evidence, with the Consent of
all the world that knew them, Christians,
Hereticks, Heathens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be not a more
satisfying Evidence of truth, than if a Pope
of Rome and his Council should say, so and
so it was, (as <hi>Liberius</hi> condemned <hi>Athanasius,</hi>)
without or against the rest of the world? If
the Question were whether ever there was
such a man as <hi>Gregory</hi> the first or seventh,
or such a man as <hi>Luther,</hi> or as <hi>Charles</hi> the
Great, or <hi>Car.</hi> 5. or King <hi>Iames</hi> in England,
or such a thing as the French Massacre, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Is not the current uncontroled self-evidencing
History of these matters, more certain than
if the Pope and Council of Trent only had
told us of them?</p>
            <p>And we have all your valid testimony in,
with ours. As you are part of the witnesses
that received the Scriptures, and as you have
among you the Teachers and Professors of
them, or have any other Evidence of their
truth, besides a <hi>pretended Power to Iudge
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:50455:44"/>
for all the world,</hi> you are a part (and but a
part) of our Historical witness. And can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
the Pope and his Council tell us as cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly
whether <hi>Homer, Virgil, Ovid, Cicero,</hi>
were ever in the world, and their writings be
not spurious, as they are <hi>part of the world
that hath credibly received it,</hi> as if they
pretend a <hi>power to judge infallibly</hi> whether
it be so or not?</p>
            <p>XI. It is an injury to God for such arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
fellows to pretend that he hath entail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on them a power to do that, which he
enableth men by Natural means to do as well
and better without them. As to pretend that
God hath given them a judicial power, to tell
us whether the Statutes of England are true
or spurious? Whether ever there were such
Kings or Parliaments as made them? &amp;c.
Doth not the Certain Historical Tradition
of the world suffice for this without a super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
power? If you say <hi>that soul-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments
must have more certainty than
bodily?</hi> I answer, 1. The more impudent are
you that would give us less. 2. The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the matter alloweth ordinarily no
more. As <hi>sense</hi> told the <hi>seers</hi> of Christs and
the Apostles Miracles that they <hi>saw them,</hi>
and the hearers and readers of the Gospel that
they <hi>heard and read it,</hi> so all the difference
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:50455:45"/>
between <hi>their</hi> way of faith and <hi>ours</hi> is, that
what <hi>they</hi> took by <hi>their own sense Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately,</hi>
that we take by a concatenation of
<hi>successive senses and Tradition historical</hi> by
currant proof. 3. You your selves find you
have no more certainty that the Scripture is
not a forged writing than you have that there
was such a man as King <hi>Iames</hi> in <hi>England,</hi>
whatever you pretend: 4. Do you not know
that you must resolve even your pretended
<hi>Authoritative Certainty</hi> into our <hi>Rational
Historical Certainty.</hi> He that knoweth not
that ever there was a Pope, <hi>(e. g. Greg. 7.
Innoc. 9. Clem. 8.)</hi> or that ever there was
a Council (<hi>e. g.</hi> of <hi>Trent, Lateran</hi>) know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not what they determined: But how
know you what Popes and Councils you
have had but by <hi>common Historical proof.</hi>
Do you believe it only by the <hi>Iudicial de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees</hi>
of later Popes and Councils?</p>
            <p>XII. If the Pope and his Council know
the Certainty of these things, it is either by
<hi>Evidence</hi> and <hi>History</hi> as all men may do, or
by <hi>Inspiration.</hi> If by <hi>Historical Evidence,</hi>
it is extant before: If by <hi>Inspiration,</hi> let
them prove themselves to be Prophets: Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by their Prophesyings, Miracles, or
other Evidences, that may satisfie a man
that is not mad.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:50455:45"/>
XIII. <hi>Alphonsus</hi> a <hi>Castro</hi> tells us, some
Popes understood not Grammar, and common
history tells us what lads and ignorant fellows
divers of them have been; And their own
writers and General Councils tell us how
horridly wicked many of them have been,
(as <hi>Ioh. 22. Eugenius</hi> and other damned as he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks
by Councils: And <hi>Honorius</hi> the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothelite,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>) And is it probable that
God should <hi>Inspire to Infallibility, Hereticks,
Ignorant fellows, debauched wicked men,</hi>
and work a <hi>Miracle</hi> to teach them to know
that Infallibly which they knew not at
all? When the Scripture and Nature tell us
how he abhorreth such men.</p>
            <p>XIV. They give us <hi>no Proof</hi> of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility;
Either from any promise of God
antecedently, or subsequent effect: How
then shall we be sure of it.</p>
            <p>XV. It is impossible for us to know who
is a true Pope: And is <hi>every man</hi> that will
<hi>call himself Pope,</hi> or <hi>only the true ones</hi> possest
with this Infallibility? If all; then one of
<hi>our Bishops</hi> may have it when he will: If not,
no man can be sure of Gods word for want of
being sure who is a true Pope? Read but
what a plunge poor Mr. <hi>Iohnson, alias Terret,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:50455:46"/>
alias</hi> &amp;c. is put to, as to the Questions about
what makes a Pope in his answers to me, and
you will see how they are bewildred: Their
fourty years Schism, in which there were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
pretended Popes, and the uncertainty
who is the true successor to this day, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
since <hi>Eugenius</hi> was deposed as a Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
by a General Council, hath left this
matter unrecoverably uncertain. If Electors
give the Essence, People, Priests, Princes,
Prelates, Cardinals, have been Electors by
turns. If Consecration be necessary; it must
be by an Inferiour, and no man knoweth by
whom, and some have been Popes unconse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated,
and their power defended. If the
Churches acceptance be necessary, no man
knoweth in many schisms which had the
greater party; but certainly neither had the
Church.</p>
            <p>XVI. It is impossible to know which
have been <hi>true General Councils:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
impossible to know which of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
are Gods word, and the Churches faith.
They are utterly disagreed of this among
themselves. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and the Papalines
tell us it is those only that are approved by
the Pope, (and so if all the Christian world
had no more wit than to send their Bishops
from all parts of the Earth, to sit as long as
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:50455:46"/>
the Council of Trent did (divers Popes
Reigns) it is in the Popes power whether
they shall be Approved Councils when all is
done). But how know we <hi>which are Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved?</hi>
Is it by the <hi>Decree of other Councils?</hi>
No: None hath ventured to determine it.
It is therefore by <hi>Common Historical Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence:</hi>
And so your <hi>faith</hi> must be thereinto
resolved. And yet <hi>here</hi> History faileth you.
How many Councils are Controverted? <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi>
will partly tell you. What wanted
<hi>Ephes. 2?</hi> What wanted that at <hi>Basil?</hi> And
many more such, I have elsewhere debated.</p>
            <p>XVII. There never was a real General
Council in the world (unless you will call
the twelve Apostles one.) This is the great
cheat of the Papists: which I wonder all men
that ever read History do not see as plainly,
as any lie in History can be seen. Was it
not the Romane Emperours that called the
Councils? Had they any power out of their
own dominions? Were not all the Patriarchs
only in one Empire? Is their Jurisdiction
mentioned in the <hi>Concil. Nicen.</hi> any further
extended? Read in <hi>Binnius Surius</hi> or any
others, the subscribed Names to all the
Councils, and then peruse the Maps and To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pography
of the Roman Empire and the <hi>noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tias
Episcopatuum</hi> (even <hi>Aub. Myraeus</hi> famed
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:50455:47"/>
for a feigner) and you will see that all the
Councils were made up of the subjects of the
Empire alone, or such as had been thereto
accustomed while they were their subjects,
(and but few of them,) unless some odd
Bishop that no man knows what he was:
Indeed when <hi>Scythia</hi> and <hi>Persia</hi> wanted help,
they placed a Bishop in an Imperial City
neer <hi>Scythia</hi> (as <hi>Tomis</hi>) and <hi>Persia,</hi> and
gave him leave to help the Country as far as
he could, and called him Bishop of <hi>Scythia</hi>
or <hi>Persia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what is this to a true General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
representing all the Churches in the
world (on the terms as Dr. <hi>Holden</hi> honestly
requireth.) If you have a mind to laugh at the
mans Ignorance in Cosmographie you may
read Mr. <hi>Iohnson, alias Terrets</hi> Reply to me
(which I am not so idle yet as to answer,)
confuting me by instances out of <hi>Thracia</hi>
and such like. But the thing is most Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in History that as the <hi>Scots</hi> call the
meeting of their Ministers a <hi>General Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,</hi>
meaning of that Kingdom, and not of
all the world, so the Councils in the Empire
were called <hi>General,</hi> only as to that Empire
and not to all the world: which I am ready
to make good to any man that can understand
History. The Pope was by one Prince made
the chief Patriarch of that Imperial Church
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:50455:47"/>
as the Kings of <hi>England</hi> preferred the Arch-Bishop
of <hi>Canterbury;</hi> And four others they
joined with him; of which one claimed
Primacy when the Imperial seat was remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
thither (never dreaming of a Divine
right; else he could never have laid that
claim;) And the Councils were only as our
Convocations, and seldom extended to half
the Empire. And little did those Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
think, that thence their subject Popes
and Councils would claim Supremacy at the
Antipodes, and turn the <hi>orbis Romanus</hi> to
<hi>orbis terrarum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>XVIII. There never <hi>will be,</hi> nor <hi>must
be,</hi> nor <hi>can be</hi> a <hi>true General Council</hi> in the
world. I have fully proved it in the second
part of my <hi>Key</hi> for <hi>Catholicks;</hi> Read it there
or Choose.</p>
            <p>XIX. Your Popes and Councils <hi>have
made no determination</hi> at all of many of the
matters in your Question. Where have <hi>they</hi>
determined, which are the true Copies of
the Hebrew and Greek Text? Do you
call us for our only Certainty to a Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
that was never made to this day!
O for Modesty and Conscience! Where
have they determined which are the right
among all the various Readings? What
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:50455:48"/>
need <hi>Lucas Brugensis, Alba,</hi> and so many
others search after this with so much industry
if the Pope have determined it? Where
have they determined which are the only
Currant or true Translations (however they
have extolled the Vulgar Latine.) Is <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus</hi>
and other such Condemned? Where
are all the Translators differences reconciled
by the decision of Pope or Council? When
did they determine the Controversies of
Commentators of the sence of a thousand
Texts of Scripture.</p>
            <p>I must confess that a just indignation ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
in me at the reading of such soul-cheating
snares; where men have the Impudence to
perswade us that we can be sure of none of
our faith, unless we be sure of Copies,
Translations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by that Authority that
never durst nor did determine of the many
remaining Controversies thereabout? And
where hath the Pope or Council given us a
Grammar or Lexicon to know the true sense
of words by, for the future? Fathers differ:
Papists differ; the world is disagreed of the
sense of words and many Texts: The Pope
hath an infallible skill, and power with his
Council to decide all, and will not: Was
there ever a crueller wickeder wight in flesh?
To see all this difference and darkness, and
not vouchsafe to speak a few words, or
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:50455:48"/>
write one Infallible Commentary to end
them? Just as if the plague or feaver were
common, and one Physicion would say, all
men shall die that will not believe that I
can cure all men; when in the mean time he
will not cure those that do believe it?</p>
            <p>What is it that your Pope and Councils
are to determine? Is it the great Essentials
of Religion? We thank them for not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:
Cannot we know that there is a
God, and a Christ, till the Pope judge it?
Have we not the Sacramental Covenant of
Grace, the Creed, Lords Prayer and Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
surely delivered before any Pope or
Council judged of them? Or is it of the hard
controverted points: <hi>Do it</hi> then; and let us
see that <hi>you can do it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>XX. Hath the Pope power to judge <hi>in
utramque partem, either way,</hi> or only one
<hi>way?</hi> May he judge that there is a God or
no God, a Christ or no Christ, a Heaven
or no Heaven, a Scripture or none, at his
pleasure? If so, must we believe him if he
be for the Negative? Take you that Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
we will have none of it: Or is he only
to <hi>Iudge truly,</hi> and then only to be believed?
(that there is a God, a Christ, a Scripture,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>) So may and must every Teacher, yea
and every Christian Judge. If you say that
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:50455:49"/>
he cannot go besides the truth, General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
and Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> himself said otherwise.</p>
            <p>XXI. The Pope and his Council differ
from the Council of <hi>Laodicea</hi> and the <hi>ancient
Church,</hi> upon <hi>this very Question, What is the
word of God,</hi> even of the <hi>Canon of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture:</hi>
For full proof whereof I refer you to
Bishop <hi>Cousins</hi> Book, which bringeth full
testimony from antiquity.</p>
            <p>XXII. The use of <hi>Authority</hi> is not to
<hi>disclose</hi> all <hi>Verities,</hi> but to <hi>Govern Societies</hi> in
the management of them; If the King of
<hi>Rome</hi> could prove himself King of all the
world, that would but enable him to <hi>Govern</hi>
the world: When one man that is at his foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stool
that is more <hi>Wise and Learned,</hi> may
<hi>know</hi> better than he and his Council too,
what's true or false.</p>
            <p>XXIII. Your very foundation is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
in its self. What do you make a
Pope to be but the <hi>Vicar of Christ?</hi> And
(mark Reader) can any man be sure that he
speaks true as <hi>Pope</hi> or <hi>Christs Vicar,</hi> that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
knew that he was <hi>Pope</hi> or <hi>Christs Vicar?</hi>
Or can any man believe that <hi>Christ</hi> hath an
<hi>Infallible Vicar</hi> before he believe in <hi>Christ
himself,</hi> and that <hi>he is Infallible?</hi> It's a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:50455:49"/>
to believe the Pope as his <hi>Vicar</hi> or
<hi>Pope,</hi> before we <hi>believe Christ.</hi> If you believe
that the Pope hath Power or Infallibility,
you must believe that <hi>Christ gave it him.</hi> And
if you believe that <hi>he gave it him,</hi> it must be
by <hi>some Revelation</hi> that he gave it, and that
you must believe it. And can you believe
<hi>that Revelation</hi> that made him Pope or Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible,
before you believe any <hi>Revelation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>XXIV. The same contradiction there is
in believing a Council or the Church, before
you believe <hi>Divine Revelation:</hi> For you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
know till you believe Divine Revelation,
that Council or Church have any such being
or power.</p>
            <p>XXV. Either the Pope and Council
themselves know the true Copies, Readings
and <hi>Translations</hi> from the <hi>Authority of former
Councils,</hi> or by <hi>their own:</hi> or by the <hi>Evidence
of the thing:</hi> and <hi>Common History:</hi> or by <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration</hi>
or <hi>Supernatural Revelation:</hi> If all
the rabble of wicked Popes and Prelates
pretend to Rule the Church and our faith by
<hi>Inspiration,</hi> they are crackt-braind fanaticks:
Sure they <hi>were</hi> no Prophets <hi>before</hi> they were
Popes or Councillers. But if it be by <hi>their
own Authority,</hi> who will take a self-made
faith, of men that Believe only because they
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:50455:50"/>
Believe? And must have all others believe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
because they believed before them? Then
it is themselves and not Christ that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.
If it be, <hi>former Popes</hi> and Councils
that they believe, tell us whom and why the
<hi>first</hi> believed? Mark, that you cannot arise to
St. <hi>Peter:</hi> For the various Copies and Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which we are in question of, were all
made since St. <hi>Peters</hi> daies.</p>
            <p>XXVI. When in a Council the major
part carry it by vote (perhaps by one or a
few) How shall we be sure that all the minor
part were deceived?</p>
            <p>XXVII. How shall all those <hi>Abassines,
Armenians, Indians</hi> in <hi>New-England</hi> or others
that know not that ever there was a Pope or
General Council, in the world, become Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians?
Or are you sure they are none?</p>
            <p>XXVIII. We <hi>see by experience</hi> in the
foresaid Nations, and <hi>feel in our selves,</hi> that
men may have a certain faith without recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
it from the Pope. Can you make me
know that I do not believe, when I know that
I do? And can you prove that only the third
part of Christians in the world are true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
and have Certain faith, because all the
rest receive it not from the Pope? and why
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:50455:50"/>
may not the major part of the Church be sure
as well as he?</p>
            <p>XXIX. Hath the Church a twofold
foundation for faith? If the Pope and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
believe Gods word to be his word on one
Ground, and all other men on another ground,
(that is, because <hi>they say it,</hi>) then we have <hi>two
faiths</hi> and <hi>two Churches</hi> on <hi>two foundations.</hi>
But if otherwise, then Pope and Council do
as we must do (by their doctrine,) even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it, because they say it themselves.</p>
            <p>XXX. The Councils Decrees of Faith
are so Voluminous that not one Priest of four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
knoweth them all; and not one lay man of
many thousand: The very bulk therefore of
your faith, must make it more uncertain than
ours is: And who can tell whether he have it
all?</p>
            <p>XXXI. The words of your Councils are
as obscure as Scripture words; and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted
by your Doctors: And how can it
be otherwise when humane language is so am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous,
in such huge Volumes? How then
shall the sense of your Councils themselves
be certainly known?</p>
            <p>XXXII. Councils are rarely extant: God
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:50455:51"/>
only knoweth whether ever there will be ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
(even a pretended one:) And must we
have no judge in the mean time to give us a
Certainty of the meaning of the very forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Councils themselves? Most confess that
the Pope himself may err?</p>
            <p>XXXIII. It is but few persons in the
world that ever saw and consulted with a
Pope and a General Council? How then shall
we be all sure, what they said or determined?
How know we whether the Records of them
be truest in <hi>Crab,</hi> in <hi>Surius,</hi> in <hi>Nicolinus,</hi> in
<hi>Binnius</hi> or in none of them? What was <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranzas</hi>'s
fault that he is blamed for? Which
of the various Copies of Canons are true
which are given us oft by the same Author?
Who knoweth what alterations the <hi>Index
expurgatorius</hi> (not infallible) maketh in the
books? Have we no more or other Certainty
of our Creed than of all these Councils, so
variously and doubtfully delivered?</p>
            <p>XXXIV. Seeing that each lay man that
never saw Pope or Councils, can know them
only by <hi>believing the Priest</hi> that telleth him,
This the Church saith, is that <hi>Priest Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?</hi>
Can no man be be certainer of the Creed
than of that <hi>Priests words?</hi> Is not the faith of
almost all your vulgar Papists, resolved into
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:50455:51"/>
the <hi>Priests affirmation?</hi> And so is it not a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
faith? And how ignorant and wicked
is many a Priest? Is our faith uncertain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we take it not on such a mans credit?</p>
            <p>XXXV. If you say that <hi>an Implicite
faith that all is true and of God which the
Pope and Council saith is so,</hi> will save men;
1. How do the people know whether the Pope
and Council <hi>determine any thing at all</hi> but
on the <hi>Priests</hi> credit? 2. Then all Infidels may
be saved without believing that there is a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
or salvation, so they do but believe in
the Pope and Council. 3. Then believing in
the Pope and Council is made far more neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
than believing in Christ. 4. Why will not
an implicite belief in Christ go as far as yours?</p>
            <p>XXXVI. By your way we can <hi>never be
Certain</hi> when we have <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Christian faith:</hi>
For more Councils may still make <hi>more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees</hi>
as hitherto they have done; and who
knows when they will hae done? And so
you make a Christian quite another thing,
than he was in the primitive Church; And
you cruelly make it far harder to be saved:
when as then, a man might be saved that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
the <hi>Covenant and Creed;</hi> and foresaid
<hi>Catechism;</hi> and now he must also believe so
many Canons, as that the Councils contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:50455:52"/>
them in the last Edition, exceed the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
of a poor Minister to buy them; and the
time and brains of most to read them.</p>
            <p>XXXVII. <hi>You confess all our faith and
Religion to be true</hi> (as far as I can learn) but
<hi>we deny all your additions: Both parties</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
being <hi>agreed</hi> of the <hi>truth of ours,</hi> it's like
to be the <hi>surer.</hi> Our Religion in the Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials,
is <hi>nothing but the Sacramental Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
the Creed, Lords Prayer and Decalogue
with the Law of Nature;</hi> And in the <hi>Integrals,</hi>
it is nothing but the <hi>Scriptures</hi> which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
as Canonical: And all this you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
confess to be true: And I told you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
how <hi>Bellarmine, Costerus</hi> and others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
less to be sufficient to Salvation (as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
necessary.) But <hi>your additions</hi> we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
as uncertain or false.</p>
            <p>XXXVIII. We <hi>see</hi> you to be a <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Kingdom</hi> set up against Christs express
determination, <hi>Luk. 22. 26. 1. Pet.</hi> 5. 3. As
the Geographia Nubiensis saith (<hi>In Vrbe
Roma,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>In the</hi> City <hi>of Rome are the seats
of a King called the Pope: Nor is there any
superiority in dignity above the Pope, and
Kings are lower (or inferior) than he.</hi>) We
see that you have compaginated your policie
all for these <hi>carnal Ends;</hi> and that <hi>dignity,</hi>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:50455:52"/>
and <hi>dominion,</hi> and <hi>riches,</hi> and <hi>worldliness</hi> is
promoted by your faith: And that your Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
is propagated and upheld by most inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
cruelties and bloodshed, and they must
be burned that seem not to believe as you do:
And will it not raise suspicions in us of the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
of such men, when they <hi>make</hi> their
own <hi>faith,</hi> and tell us that we have no certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of ours but by their determination: When
also we see the wickedness of mens lives
among you, in common Fornication and other
heinous sin; when the <hi>certainest faith,</hi> will
have the <hi>holiest life,</hi> when it is Subjectively
as well as Objectively certain.</p>
            <p>XXXIX. You <hi>destroy</hi> or greatly <hi>discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit</hi>
the <hi>Grand Evidence</hi> of the Christian
faith, even <hi>Miracles:</hi> How then can your
faith be the most Certain? For when you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
that Miracles are as common through all
the world as Priests Masses are (in turning
bread into no bread as aforesaid) and yet no
man seeth any proof of one such Miracle, when
really it is no less than <hi>Christs Resurrection</hi>
which you pretend to be so common before all
the Churches; what is this but to tempt men
to take all the Scripture and Apostolical Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
to be no surer? And then where is our
faith?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:50455:53"/>
XL. Lastly, I end where I almost began:
If our sense be true, the Pope and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
are false, and therefore our faith not to be
received only nor chiefly on their trust. For
their faith teacheth us, <hi>not to believe Gods
most Natural Revelations,</hi> to <hi>the sound senses
and Intellective perception of all men in the
world,</hi> as I have shewed about the Bread and
Wine in the Sacrament: And when a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie
it brought to sense it self we can
bring it no lower: And when we must either
believe <hi>your faith</hi> and its <hi>foundation</hi> false,
or believe <hi>Gods most Natural Evident Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
false,</hi> and all mens <hi>Senses and Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective
perception false,</hi> we are <hi>not able,</hi> I say
<hi>not able,</hi> to be of your faith.</p>
            <p>And now judge whose <hi>faith is more Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>
the Protestants or the Papists? And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you do well so zealously and busily; to
make use of such <hi>soul-traps</hi> and <hi>fool-traps,</hi> as
the paper is which I have answered.</p>

a Certainty in some Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
it will give some light into the matter if

of <hi>Moral Science</hi> in it self; which because

               <p>[<hi>Quest.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> 
                  <q>It seemeth not: Because there can
be no demonstrative knowledge of those
things that are subject to the will: But such
are Morals:</q> 
                  <hi>ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>But contrarily, Morals are a Science.</p>
                  <p>In this Question, 1. I will expound one
Term of the Question; 2. I will give you
one distinction: 3. And then answer the
Question.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="98" facs="tcp:50455:54"/>
1. As to the first I say that <hi>Moral</hi> is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
taken largely, for humane Acts which
are under the will absolutely:—Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
more strictly, for Acts subject to the
Power of the will, according to the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
dictate of Reason, and according to
other circumstances.</p>
                  <p>2. As to the second you must know that
Moral Doctrine hath many parts: of
which one is <hi>Positive,</hi> another is <hi>Not-posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.
Moral Science Positive,</hi> is that which
containeth humane Laws, and Divine,
which oblige us to follow or avoid things,
which are neither <hi>good</hi> nor <hi>evil;</hi> nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
prohibited and commanded by a supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
to whom it belongeth to give Laws.
But <hi>Moral Science</hi> not positive is that
which without any command of a Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directeth
humane actions: as Principles
known by themselves, or known by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
so direct; As that all that is honest
is to be done, and all that is dishonest is to
be avoided; and such like of which <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi>
speaketh in his <hi>Moral Philosophie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. As to the third I say, That Moral Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
<hi>Science,</hi> such as the Science of
Lawyers is, is not Demonstrative, though
in many things it be regulated by that
which is demonstrative. Because the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of Lawyers are founded on humane
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:50455:54"/>
Positive Laws, which receive not propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
evidently known. But <hi>Moral Science
not positive</hi> is <hi>Demonstrative;</hi> I prove it:
Because all knowledge deducing conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
Syllogistically, from Principles known
by themselves, or by experience of him
that knoweth, is demonstrative: But such
is Moral Doctrine: <hi>ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The Major is known: The Minor is
proved, Because in Moral Philosophie there
are many Principles known by themselves;
As that the will is to conform it self to right
reason; that all evil <hi>is to be</hi> avoided, and
such like. In like manner, many Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
are known by <hi>Experience;</hi> as is evident
to him that <hi>followeth experience.</hi> And I
further say, that This is more Certain than
many other things, in as much as every
man may have more <hi>Experience</hi> of his own
acts, than of other things: From whence
it is plain that this is a <hi>Science, very Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile,
Profitable and Evident.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To the Argument for the Contrary I say,
That of things subject to the will, may be
formed Propositions, true and known by
themselves, which can demonstrate many
Conclusions.]</p>

the Holy Scripture, which expresseth the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure

of faith: And this Measure God assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
we will hold, that we may write or teach
nothing dissonant <hi>from the</hi> Holy Scripture.

write any thing, let it be <hi>ipso facto</hi> esteemed

principally assent to those things, that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
in Scripture, and as they are there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered.
And so Theologie differs not from
faith. The reason of which is because the

so only held by Divine Authority.</p>
               <p>Scotus Prolog. Q. 2. <hi>doth conclude</hi> p. 7.
<hi>that the Doctrine of the</hi> Canonical Scripture
is sufficient to the attainment of our end:
<hi>And</hi> that the Holy Scripture containeth suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
the Doctrine necessary to a Viator (a
<hi>man</hi> in this life.)</p>
               <p>II. And to prove this Scripture to be true
he giveth us these ten proofs; (which I must
not repeat at large) 1. From the predictions
of Scripture which God only could do.
2. From their notable concord. 3. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
that their own Doctrine against Lying
and such like prove that the writers lied not.
4. From the great diligence and concord of
the Receivers. 5. From the Rationability
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:50455:56"/>
of the Contents. 6. From the unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness
of all other waies. 7. From the sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of the Church. 8. From the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
which God would never affix to a lie,
which he largely urgeth. 9. From the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of aliens and adversaries. 10. That
God would not give up those to a lie who so
seek him with all their hearts as many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
do.</p>
               <p>Abundance of their Authors more I could
cite, who thus argue for the truth of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
and not from an Authoritative decisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a Pope or Council only. And what
in this they give to them at other times, doth
but shew that their foundation was so much
weaker than ours.</p>

humane Authority differeth not from opinion:
because the place from humane authority is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical,
and an argument thence taken is the
weakest: And therefore the faith which

opinion.</hi> But <hi>pag.</hi> 9. of the faith which
resteth on Gods authority, he granteth us.
that it may stand with Science of many of
the same things, and that Divine authority
and demonstrative reason may concur to cause
the same assent. But <hi>p.</hi> 10. he dissenteth
from them that <hi>hold that Gods attestations
were such</hi> to <hi>those that saw Christs Miracles
and Resurrection,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>as certainly proved
the truth of his Godhead, and so of his word</hi>
(which is <hi>Aquinas</hi> his honest Doctrine 3. <hi>q.
43. act.</hi> 4. against which <hi>Durandus</hi> writeth
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:50455:57"/>
this.) And because it is us as well as <hi>Aquinas</hi>
that he opposeth I will briefly confute his
reasons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The first is,</hi> Because Demonstration neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitateth
the understanding to believe: But
many that saw <hi>Lazarus</hi> raised, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> believed
not Christ to be God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore Miracles
were not a sufficient demonstration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Not sufficient to <hi>all things, but
sufficient to do their own</hi> part. By this you
would prove that there is no demonstration of
any thing almost in the world; For there is
almost nothing which convinceth all men. I
distinguish therefore of a <hi>disposed</hi> and an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposed</hi>
understanding. And as to the later
I deny the major. Demonstrations constrein
not millions of undisposed Intellects. <hi>Recipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur
ad modum recipientis.</hi> What need any
other proof than your oft mentioned denial
of Bread in the Eucharist? Because millions
deny the perception of all mens Senses and
Intellects thereby, are not things sensible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrable
or evident? Can you hope to
bring more cogent proof, And yet this is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected:
And so were Christs miracles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The second is</hi> Gregory, Faith hath no me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
where humane reason hath experience,
and there is Science.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> A falshood as easily denied as as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted
without proof: If by Merit you mean
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:50455:58"/>
Rewardableness. For it is only <hi>Natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary
necessity</hi> which evacuateth moral
<hi>Good or Evil.</hi> The <hi>will</hi> may shew its <hi>vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi>
or <hi>vice</hi> in receiving or rejecting Objective
ascertaining Evidence.</p>
               <p>The third is that it was <hi>not known of it
self that this miracle attested the truth of what
Christ said.</hi> But whether <hi>per se</hi> or by <hi>conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,</hi>
it is a most evident certainty, that a
man, yea abundance of men that assert such
a point of unspeakable consequence to the
world, doing abundance of open notorious
miracles as professed witnesses or proofs of
their Doctrine, could not do this but by
Gods extraordinary providence. And that
if this be not to be taken for a Divine Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
we know of none that mortals
are capable of, nor a possibility of the worlds
escaping the deceit, as caused unresistibly by
God. His Answers to this are not worthy
the repeating.</p>
               <p>The same Author, <hi>li. 3. d. 23. q</hi> 7. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
of the Certainty of faith, whether it
be certainer than Science, brings in the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
answers of others: 1. That there is a
Certainty of Evidence (and this Science
hath,) and a Certainty of <hi>Adhesion,</hi> (and this
Faith hath.) But this he rejecteth, and shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
(truly) that <hi>Adhesion</hi> is not properly
<hi>Certainty,</hi> and also that the fullest Evidence
causeth the closest Adhesion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:50455:58"/>
2. <hi>That</hi> Faith <hi>hath most</hi> Certainty in se, in
the thing, <hi>and</hi> Science <hi>most</hi> Certainly quoad
nos, <hi>as to us. But the vanity of this he truly
sheweth: For to be</hi> Certain in it self <hi>and not
to us, is but to be</hi> True: <hi>And all things</hi> True
<hi>are equally True: But no</hi> truth <hi>is Certain to
us or</hi> Credible, <hi>without revelation to us. And
as he saith</hi> (The Certainty of Act or habit
is not from the Certainty of the object in it
self, but from the mode which the habit putteth
as to the person, and the act: No way there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>(saith he)</hi> is the act or habit called
Certain, unless it be certain as to us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore he is forced to conclude that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
habits and acts of Science are</hi> Certainer to
us than faith and its act, and that both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensively,
Science having both certainty <hi>of</hi>
Evidence <hi>and</hi> Adhesion (if that be <hi>Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,)</hi>
And intensively; for Science hath no
doubt permixt as faith oft hath.</p>
               <p>And he is forced to conclude his faith into
the further uncertainty following.</p>

                  <hi>Mentioning three opinions: The first, that</hi>
the substance of bread which was there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,

saith he</hi> (that the substance of bread and
wine cease to be, and the accidents only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main,
and under them Christs body begins to
be is the common opinion of all Divines,
which I hold for the determination of the
Church, and not for any other reason. The
third (that there remaineth the substance of
bread and wine with Christs body) would be
very reasonable, if the Churches determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
were not contrary: for that opinion sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
and avoideth all the difficulties which
arise from seperating the accidents from <hi>the
subject.</hi> And the contrary to it is not had
out of the Canon of the Bible; nor doth it
include any contradiction for Christs body
to consist with the substance of bread any
more than with the accidents—<hi>And after
more, answering the argument of Mass-mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
by every Priest he saith</hi> [Sometime
about some things there must more Miracles be
put, though it might be done by fewer, and
that because it pleaseth God; And the Church
knoweth this, by some Revelation that so it

                  <hi>Either he jeareth them, or else he

Scotus, <hi>&amp;c. I will end with learned</hi> Rada,
<hi>who</hi> Vol. 4. Contr. 7. a. 1. pag. 164, 165.
<hi>having shewed that</hi> This is my Body <hi>will not
in its own proper sense infer what</hi> Aquinas
<hi>and others gather, saith</hi> [Yet indeed now <hi>(we

taught by the Holy Ghost understandeth those
words. For the Scriptures are expounded by
that spirit which they were made by: And so
it must be supposed that the Catholick Church
by that spirit which delivered us the faith,
even taught by the Holy Ghost, so expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and exploded the first sense, and chose
this, being that other was not true, as to the
remaining of <hi>the substance of</hi> bread after

they exclude the substance of bread].</p>
               <p>O all men of common sense and reason in
the world; we appeal to your humanity in
the Controversie between the Papists and us.
While they assert a Miracle by every Priest
every day that he masseth in all the world,
and deny the truth of Gods primary natural
Revelation to all mens common senses, they
resolve their faith of the Certainty of all
this, not into the Scripture, but into such an
Inspiration of the Holy Ghost as the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
themselves were written by: The
Scripture must not be our proof of this Inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
but must be proved by it. We must
believe that thus every wicked Pope and the
Prelates of the major vote in his packt
Councils have this Inspiration? When they
do no Miracles, they live so much worse
than other Ministers of Christ, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
of them hath long been the vain
wish and attempt of the Christian world;
They murder the servants of Jesus in their
Inquisitions, and yet we must lay all our faith
and salvation on it, that they have all a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical
spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Well;</hi> If it be proved Certainly to the
world, that the Pope and his Church are all
Prophets, or Inspired by the Holy Ghost as
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:50455:61"/>
the Apostles were, then I declare that the
Papists are in the right: If not, I will be
no willing Subject <hi>of the KING of</hi> Rome,
<hi>while he so abuseth the Word, the Church,
the Honour, of the Churches King.</hi>
