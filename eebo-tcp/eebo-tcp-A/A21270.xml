            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>As he witholding of the same which they would fayne retayne.</l>
               <l>For after labor long bestowed and trauell much pursewde:</l>
               <l>And care much vsed yet in ende they be agayne renewde.</l>

               <l>Not onely by the wretched care that seekes it to encrease:</l>
               <l>And by desire insaciate which therin can not cease.</l>
               <l>But also by his owne abuse and by the further shame:</l>

               </l>
               <l>What misery is this for man to moyle with all his care:</l>

               </l>
               <l>And yet when he hath got at large the thing he did desire:</l>
               <l>It should be cause that more and more his stomake should require.</l>
               <l>And yet not onely that, but eke his state for to abase:</l>
               <l>As also through his owne abuse the same for to deface.</l>
               <l>And marke what great vngratefulnes is rendred for the store:</l>
               <l>Which he doth leaue to the successe of other, though before</l>

               <l>How frustrate, fonde, and very vayne his sparing all should be.</l>
               <l>For what more better is it sayde of him when he deceast:</l>
               <l>But since the chorle could not be filde now shall it be my rest.</l>
               <l>For he though still vncessantly did seeke for such a stay:</l>
               <l>Yet when as he possessed it it was his owne decay.</l>
               <l>And therfore now the miser gone hath left against his will:</l>
               <l>The fruites of all his payne to me and it shalbe my fill.</l>
               <l>Since therfore thus in this same world the man which doth retayne</l>
               <l>The full of worldly wealth his state, is so exceading vayne.</l>
               <l>What may be sayde of those which liue in needefulnes and want:</l>
               <l>With whom ne welth ne ease abounds but euery thing is scant?</l>
               <l>What may it now be thought of him which all hath spent away:</l>

               <l>No more but briefly to conclude he reapes deserued payne:</l>
               <l>And therfore all is meere abuse and euery thing is vayne.</l>
               <l>For so the world is diuersly tormented with his owne:</l>

               <l>Some by their high estate are vext and some for want of wealth:</l>

               <l>Or who can comprehende so much experience of his time?</l>
               <l>But that as long as life doth last he is a slaue to cryme,</l>
               <l>No man can bridell so the world nor worldlines refrayne:</l>
               <l>But still the world infecteth all and each thing puts to payne.</l>
               <l>And therfore with a lothsome hart I forced am to say:</l>
               <l>That euery thing is vayne, because it comes to vayne decay.</l>
               <l>What pleasure more doth he attayne that hath the chiefe of all</l>

               <l>Then he which neuer could discerne what such delites should meane,</l>
               <l>But is from such abusions kinde by force excluded cleane.</l>
               <l>Doth golde adorne the sprite of man or bewtify the minde:</l>
               <l>Or is there grace by worldly wealth into the soule<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> assignde?</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:5779:103"/>Or is the raging lust restraynde by heapes of earthly store?</l>
               <l>No, no, but wickednes and crime is therby moued more.</l>
               <l>For earthly treasure is the bagge which vices doth maintaine:</l>
               <l>And vice is that same very thing which maketh all things vayne.</l>
               <l>Who therfore gladly would receaue the happy life and time:</l>
               <l>Must in his mortall race auoyde the motions vnto crime.</l>
               <l>Regarding each thing in this vale as I haue sayde before:</l>
               <l>To be but frustrate, vayne, and fonde, no better nor no more.</l>
               <l>For mortall trace a passage is vnto another life:</l>
               <l>Which is not mortall but deuoyde of foolish mortall strife.</l>
               <l>And therfore he that willingly would other life attayne:</l>
               <l>Must seeke for to reforme this life because it is but vayne.</l>
