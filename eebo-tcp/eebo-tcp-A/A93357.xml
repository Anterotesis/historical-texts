         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe Kingdome of God is at hand, which comes not with obſervation, ſalvation is near
unto all that will receive it, redemption is coming in a time unexpected, and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
in a way not known, as a thief in the dark is the heir come, whoſe light out of
darkneſs is ſhining, and that which ſhineth out of darkneſs is it alone that giveth
the knowledge of God, whom to know is life eternal; and the brightneſs of the day of God is
ſpringing forth of darkneſs as the morning ſun after the darkneſs of the night, and glorious is
this day of the revelation of God, to all them that have waited for his coming, who in the life of
his power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> through the obedience in his love, come to rejoyce in his dominion over all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of darkneſs for ever, and ſound forth the dreadful day of his power unto all the inhabitants of
the earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from the which, Chriſt the Saviour comes to take peace, and to b<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ing the ſword of
Gods judgments into the bowels of all the earthly minded, and in him that judgeth the ſecrets of
all mens hearts, doth his followers rejoyce, and proclaim him unto you all that makes an end
of ſin, who of the father of love and mercy is tendred unto all that will receive him, that in him
who condemns the evil deeds and ſin in the fleſh, ſalvation might be attained unto who now
comes unto his own, of whom many receive him not for he is come to judge the world whom God ſo
loved that he gave his ſon the light of the world, that whoſoever believe in him (by whom the
ſecrets of all hearts are, and ſhall be judged) may be ſaved from wrath to come, and find a ſure
hiding place, when the wicked ſhall be cut off the earth.</p>
            <p>And now who will receive the Lamb, in whoſe mouth there is no guile, who among the ſons
of men will receive him that hath been ſlain from the foundation of the world, who will receive
him that is the gift of God which is perfect, who will receive him that is a man of ſorrowes,
whoſe beauty is hid from the prudent of the earth, who will receive him that the Prieſts cry out
againſt and the rulers ſay away with him from the earth, who will come unto the waters of life
and return unto the fountain of living mercies, that in his belly the ſprings of life may be felt:
who can endure to follow him to the end of the world, whoſe Kingdome is not of this world, and
who receiveth not honour of men, who can hear, receive, and keep the hard ſayings, and drink
his blood that cleanſeth from all ſin, who is willing to receive him that is the reſurrection and
the life, whoſe preſence troubled and terrified his own Diſciples ſo that their hearts burned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
them, who will lay down their Crowns at the foot of him that is the light, and mourn over him
that is ſlain whom they have pierced, and through patience, long ſuffering, and obedience, follow
the one Shepheard in the regeneration even unto them is the word of conſolation ſent.</p>
            <p>Therefore be ye awakned O all ye rulers and people, let not your hearts be hardned againſt
Gods witneſs in you neither ſtop your ears, nor cloſe your eyes, for ofa truth the Lord is at hand,
and is Come to cry you, wi<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

men, hath he ſent in the meekneſs of his love, to preach the innocent life of his ſon among you, in
meekneſs, patience, ſufferings and tribulations, who being reviled, revileth not again, but in
patience enduring long impriſonments, yea want and ſickneſs there, and abuſes, cruel mockings,
ſtonings in the ſtreet dayly, and revilings by ungodly perſons, whoſe cruelty is increaſed and their
ſins multiplied increaſing to the day or judgment, and righteous revelation of Gods wrath upon
all unrighteouſneſs of men, who hold his truth in that which is not his righteouſneſs, which is now
brought near unto all that fear, before him in uprightneſs of heart, that truth in the inward
parts they might come to know, and in it worſhip the God of the ſpirits of all fleſh</p>
            <p>And all you people that are meek and tender, who have been taught by the Prieſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
not by the Lord, whoſe mercy to the humble abideth for ever, the Lord God Almighty hath ſo
loved you, that he hath provided a better Teacher for you, which ſhall not be removed and a
Prieſt that abideth for ever, and a Biſhop for your ſouls, and behold he is no leſs then a King yea
he ruleth over Kings, and help is laid upon him, who is mighty, and he is able to ſave, and he is
ſo willing to do it that he hath laid down his life for that end<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and he ſtandeth at the door and
knocks, and he that knocks is called the word, and the word is as a hamer, and the word is in the
heart where Chriſt is to be received, and where this knocks for entrance, and it knocks againſt ſin
and in him is no ſin, and he cometh to ſave you from ſin, and to lead you the way to the Father;
and without money doth he ever teach, nay he giveth abundantly unto all that are taught by him,
and that more then mortal riches, and you may have him to be with you alwaies for ever, and he
can reſolve all your doubts, and ſatisfie every one, and repleniſh the weary, and nouriſh the faint,
and in him are all Gods treaſures, of the which by him you may come to pertake for ever, and he

and declare it unto thee, that thy fallow ground may be ript up to find the Pearl, for this is
