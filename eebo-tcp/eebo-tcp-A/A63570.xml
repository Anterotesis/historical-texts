            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A TRUE NARRATIVE OF THE Duke of Monmouth's Late JOURNEY into the WEST, IN A LETTER FROM AN Eye-witneſs thereof, to his Correſpondent in <hi>London.</hi>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THAT branch of our conteſt (which theſe unhappy times have occaſioned betwixt your ſelf and me, private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) concerning the preſent temper of the people of <hi>England,</hi> as to the reception of Popery, hath now (I think) ſo fully been decided, that I ſhall no longer differ from you in that point, but with joy acknowledg to you, that I am perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convinced, nay ſure, that not only the Principles, but even the very <hi>Genius</hi> of the people of <hi>England</hi> will never endure to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain rid like a Hackney of <hi>Rome,</hi> to both the temporal and eternal deſtruction of the poor Creature. Of this my eyes as well as my underſtanding ſaw the demonſtration, when I ſaw that incredible (if not univerſal) confluence of people of all Qualities, Sexes, and Ages, meet to welcome a Proteſtant Duke into theſe Countries. Now that I have not miſcall'd this a Demonſtration, pray obſerve this Journal of the Duke's progreſs, and the peoples joy.</p>
            <p>On the 24<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi> he came from <abbr>Eſq</abbr> 
               <hi>Thyn</hi>'s in <hi>Wiltſhire</hi> to <abbr>Eſq</abbr> 
               <hi>Speak</hi>'s in <hi>Sommerſetſhire,</hi> in which Progreſs he had all the way
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56828:2"/>
been careſſed with the joyful Welcomes and Acclamations of the people, who came from all parts, 20 miles about, filling and lining the Hedges with Men, Women and Children, ſome going before, ſome following after for ſome miles in the High ways, all the way, and inceſſantly with hearty and great ſhouts crying, God bleſs our King <hi>Charles,</hi> and God bleſs the Proteſtant Duke. Some Towns and Paridies expreſſed alſo their Country<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>reſpects in ſtrewing their ſtreets and ways thorough which he paſſed, with herbs and flowers, as was ſeen at <hi>Ilcheſter,</hi> and <hi>Pithyton,</hi> &amp;c. In ſome places where no other better preſent could be expected or made, the honeſt kind Good-women with ruſtick ſincerity preſented to him bottles of Wine, which he courteouſly accepted and taſted. Some of theſe good Dames could not reſtrain their joys, but in their homely phraſe call'd out to him thus, <hi>Maſter, we are glad to ſee you, and you are welcome into our Country.</hi> And then ſome caught hold of his Feet, ſome took him by the Hand, ſome by the Coat, but all cried, Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, welcome, no <hi>Popery,</hi> no <hi>Popery,</hi> &amp;c. When he drew near to <abbr>Eſq</abbr> 
               <hi>Speaks</hi> by 10 miles, he was met by 2000 perſons on Horſe back, who were ſo increaſt before they arrived at Mr. <hi>Speaks,</hi> that ſome conjectured they were in number near 20000, others ſaid, they were many more. At his arrival the Eſq; ſet out ſeveral Hogſheads and Veſſels of Beer, Ale, and Sider, to entertain the people, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that they (to enlarge their paſſage to the houſe) had broke down ſeveral pearch of his Park-pales; and though the hoop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ſhoutings, and acclamations of the people had ſo affrighted the Deer out of the Park, that as yet they cannot be got in again (it's conceiv'd that the people did get Veniſon as well as the Duke) yet true, loyal proteſtant, and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentleman thus received the Duke and the people. May he be an Example to all the Gentry for his Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty to his King, and love to his Country, for being an Orthodox Proteſtant, and a true hoſpitable lover of our dear true Proteſtant <hi>Engliſhmen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the 26 of <hi>Auguſt</hi> he dined with Sir <hi>J. Sydenham</hi> at <hi>Brempton,</hi> where he met ſuch an abundance of people, and ſuch a ſplendid en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, that it was difficult to determine which deſerved the greater wonder.</p>
            <p>On the 27<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi> he dined with that true Patriot <hi>William Stroud,</hi> Eſq; at <hi>Barrington,</hi> whoſe noble Treat to this Illuſtrious Prince and Proteſtant Duke, ſuited thoſe high qualities. Nor was this Dinner without that beſt of Muſick, the joyful ſhouts of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands.</p>
            <p>After Dinner he went to <hi>Chard,</hi> where was preſented to him a Collation of great variety and excellency, the ſecond Courſe was the hearts and tongues of very numerous people. He arrived there
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56828:2"/>
about five in the Afternoon, followed by a Train of 500 Horſemen; but when entred, he was met by a Crowd of Men, Women and Children, not a Mute amongſt them all, but all almoſt made deaf with their own Crys and Acclamations; ſcarce was there one that drank not the Kings Health, and the Dukes, to which ſtill ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded their loud Vollies of God bleſs the King with long Life, God bleſs the Proteſtant Duke his Son, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>That Evening he was moſt acceptably receiv'd and lodg'd by that worthy <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentleman, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> 
               <hi>Prideaux.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next day, <hi>viz.</hi> 28<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> after a great and ſumptuous Dinner, he rode to <hi>Ilminſter,</hi> where he accepted of a Collation as at <hi>Chard;</hi> from thence to <hi>Whitlackindon,</hi> where was his ſtated Lodgings</p>
            <p>On the 29<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi> (being <hi>Sunday)</hi> he obſerved it with a due Proteſtant and Chriſtian reſpect, and went to <hi>Ilminſter</hi>-Church, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>On the 30<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> he removed to <hi>Calliton,</hi> and lodged with the moſt ingenious, loyal, and generous Sir <hi>Walter Young.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the 31 he lodged with that <hi>Engliſh</hi> Worthy <abbr>Eſq</abbr> 
               <hi>Dukes,</hi> at <hi>Otterton,</hi> in which and all the other parts, his Treatments were rich and great, and every where his rejoicing admirers numberleſs.</p>
            <p>But on the firſt of <hi>Septemb.</hi> he journied to <hi>Exceter,</hi> where he was magnificently entertain'd at the Dean's houſe by that Gentleman of unſpotted Loyalty, Sir <hi>William Courtney.</hi> The Citizens, together with the people of all the adjacent parts, (verily believed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed 20000 perſons) came all forth to meet the Duke with their Souls and Mouths filled with love and joy, trumpetting forth his welcome, and ſhouting out thus, God bleſs our Gracious Sovereign King <hi>Charles,</hi> God bleſs the Proteſtant Duke, God bleſs the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Prince, &amp;c. But that which moſt deſerves remark, was the appearance of a company of brave ſtout young men, all clothed in linnen Waſt-coats and Drawers, white and harmleſs, having not ſo much as a ſtick in their hand, but joining hands, their number was reputed to be 10 or 1200 (the leaſt conjecture of them was 800) theſe met the Duke within 3 miles of the City, being put into or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der on a ſmall round hill, and divided into two parts, and ſo atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the coming of the Duke, who when arrived rode up between them, and after rode round each company, who then united, and went hand in hand in their order, before the Duke into the City. Where when arrived, the great concourſe of people, the amazing ſhouts, the univerſal joys were ſuch, as are more eaſily related than can be credited by the abſent Reader. I ſhall only ſay of it, that it ſuited (at this time) the reception that a Proteſtant people was willing to give to an illuſtrious Proteſtant Prince.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sept.</hi> 2. he returned to <abbr>Eſq</abbr> 
               <hi>Speaks,</hi> where again flocked in to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56828:3"/>
meet and ſee him the whole neighbouring Country, as not yet enough ſatisfied, unleſs thus extraordinarily to careſſe him in his return.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sept.</hi> 3. he dined at the worthy <abbr>Eſq</abbr> 
               <hi>Harvy</hi>'s near <hi>Yeovil,</hi> and after rode to <abbr>Eſq</abbr> 
               <hi>Thyn</hi>'s, the Country ſtill waiting in great ſhoals to expect him on <hi>Howden</hi> hill, from <hi>Crookhorn, Yeovil,</hi> and all other circumjacent parts to the number of 4 or 5000 to take their leaves of him, and to preſent him their thanks for his kind viſit, and his acceptance of their <hi>Engliſh</hi> true-hearted reſpects.</p>
            <p>Sir, you cannot but with difficulty imagine (except you had been both an eye and an ear-witneſs, as I was) with what earneſtneſs the people of all ſorts, all ſexes, all ages and degrees came forth to expreſs their Loyalty to their King and Soveraign in praying for his long life and happy reign, and in heartily drinking his Health every where, but eſpecially alſo in manifeſting their true <hi>Engliſh</hi> hearty love to this Proteſtant Duke, having never ſince his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties happy Reſtauration, had the good occaſion to ſee amongſt them their King, or any of his Royal Family until now. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try eſteeming it a great glory and happineſs to ſee one of that ſtock to appear amongſt them.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, let us remark, that in all this progreſs were divers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of noble as well as gentile quality, <hi>viz.</hi> Lords, Knights, Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires and Gentlemen, who together with the Duke made a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellation of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtants glorious in their beams derived from the Sun of great <hi>Britain.</hi>
            </p>
