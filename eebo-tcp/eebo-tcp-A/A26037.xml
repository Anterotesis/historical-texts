         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Commiſſioners are all gone
into Scotland, not onely thoſe who
were ſent from thence to the
King, to Treate with His Majeſty
laſt, who are returned much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented;
but there are alſo gone
home, the Committee that were appointed to
ſtay with the Army, and the Kings Secretary;
they are all of any power gone into Scotland, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
onely the Generall himſelfe, whoſe Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
is left here to Governe and Order the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
who are promiſed content from the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
They went away from hence on Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
and Tueſday laſt, and this preſent Thurſday
is their generall meeting day at Edenburgh, as was
appointed by the Committee of Eſtates; The
Commiſſioners, and the Miniſters often Treated
with the King, and His Majeſties laſt Anſwer to
the Commiſſioners before they went away from
hence was in effect the ſame, which the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners
of both Kingdomes received, after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49750:3"/>
of the Propoſitions here to His Majeſty. His
Majeſty doth not ſo refuſe the taking of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
or the paſſing of the Propoſitions as to
givea poſitive deniall that Hee will not paſſe the
one or Signe the other, though in effect little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter)
The ſubſtance of His Majeſties Anſwer to the
Scots Commiſſioners was thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That He is very ſenſible of the ſad condition
of His Kingdomes, and the miſeries of Wars,
none more then Himſelfe, that He hath propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
wayes for remedy thereof already, that Hee
hopes there will a hearing bee granted to Him,
And to Treate with Him for the ſpeedy ſetling of
the Kingdomes. And to the end that there may
be the better accommodation for His Majeſty and
likewiſe for His ſubjects</hi> (with whom He is to
treate) <hi>He deſires that He may reſide in ſome
convenient place, either in, or neer London or
Westminſter, where His Majeſty ſaith He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
that there may be a full hearing. But</hi> (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
God knowes how long a Treaty, and
what effects) <hi>His Majeſty then promiſes,</hi>
(which Hee ſaith He doubts not of) to give
ſatisfaction: and this is all the Anſwer which
they could have to carry to Edenburgh,
(what uſe wil be made of this God knowes)
<hi>We are very ſorry here that the Country is ſtill</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:49750:3"/>
               <hi>burdened with the Armies lying upon us, And
feare that Wee ſhall not yet be eaſed, becauſe
that ſome have already taken in Hay and other
proviſions, which they feare will be for winter
quarters, others build them ſtables, which</hi> (with
other obſervations of the Country people)
<hi>are a great and heavy burden to the minds of
many, who ſeeing the freedome of other Countries
are greeved that themſelves</hi> (who have beene
the longeſt ſufferers) <hi>ſhould be fartheſt from
being freed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are many Malignants hereabouts, this
Towne is full of them, Mr. <hi>Murry</hi> of the Bed-Chamber,
His Majeſties old Agent, whom you
had priſoner at London, and other ſuch dangerous
ones as hee, are heare, and have often recourſe
to His Majeſty; if ſome ſtricter courſe (then hath
yet beene) be not taken you may eaſily judge
what theſe things may come to; the well affected
of both Kingdomes cannot but be much troubled
at it; The Scots have often made Proclamation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
malignants comming hither, but that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valies
not; they come, and are daily admitted
and are received by His Majeſty, I pray God
they do not ſtir up a new Warre. I write to you of
theſe things with a bleeding and ſad heart; rather
deſiring a Reformation of them, then rejoycing
in them, the thought whereof cannot chuſe but
much ſad the ſpirits of all honeſt men; you may
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49750:4"/>
be ſure that Malignants comming daily to Court,
act no good for the Kingdomes, for they care not
what ruine is brought upon us, ſo that they advance
their own ends.</p>
            <p>For certaine <hi>James Graham</hi> (ſometimes Earle
of Montroſſe) is gone out of Scotland, but (by
reaſon that hee had notice of the Parliaments
Ships riding neere to the port, where hee had
intended to take Shipping) hee refuſed to paſſe
in the Ship appointed for him to go in, and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
over privately in a Veſſell elſewhere; which
was done ſo privately that few or none of his
own Officers (as it is ſayd) knew of his going,
though they came with him to goe over the Seas
alſo: It is ſuppoſed by ſome, that hee is gone
to Denmarke, others thinke hee is gone to Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
ſome that hee will onely croſſe over and
then paſſe to ſome other place by Land. But
for your further ſatisfaction from thoſe parts, I
have ſent you the Copy of a Letter that came
hither from Edenburgh this day: and I ſubſcribe
