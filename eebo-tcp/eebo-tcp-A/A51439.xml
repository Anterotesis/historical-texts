         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </argument>
            <p>AFter it had been very hotly debated in the great <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phitheatre</hi> of this World, to whom of all those, that presented themselves as Competitors the Preheminence &amp; Soveraignty were
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51761:6"/>
most due, and that by reason both of the number and variety both of the persons and things, the whole matter found so many severall, or rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Opinions, that there appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not more Judges then differences of judgements; It was agreed by common consent, that out of the whole populace of Worldly things there should be elected a <hi>Representative,</hi> that is to say, from out the <hi>foure-footed,</hi> as being the largest, at the most two, and for <hi>Birds, Fishes, Insects, creeping things, Vegetables</hi> and <hi>Mineralls</hi> one a piece, these to be chosen by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon consent, and to be sent to the next <hi>Parliament,</hi> where before Man, as the wisest and fittest judge, out of these eight a <hi>King</hi> should be chosen. For it was thought better and more agreeable with reason, that a few of the <hi>Nobles,</hi> chosen out of every Tribe or Nation, should be empowered by the consent of their whole people to elect one, then that so great a Rabble (which
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51761:6"/>
is the beast of many heads and damme of cofusion) should be againe as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled, and it may be not onely fall into different debates, but dissent themselves into a Civill Warre. After great bandying in Elections privately carried in every County of this lower World, a <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>EIGHT</hi> was at last called, to wit, as it was set downe in the Instrument, out of the County of the first, that is the Foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>footed the <hi>CALFE</hi> and the <hi>SHEEP,</hi> out of the <hi>second</hi> the <hi>GOOSE,</hi> of the <hi>third</hi> the <hi>OI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STER,</hi> of the <hi>fourth</hi> the <hi>BEE,</hi> out of the <hi>fifth</hi> the <hi>SILK-WORME,</hi> out of the <hi>six<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

He was then very well apparell'd, his Doublet and Breeches were of the

               <p>WE that are here assembled, most prudent Man, come hither with submission to thy judgement, therefore we beseech thee take it not amisse, if we bring our cause before thee at an unsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable and busy time. Be pleased to heare the case, and I will briefly open it. There is lately a great contest happened among us the Inhabitants of the whole World, that is to say, the three degrees of <hi>Animals, Vegetables</hi> and <hi>Mineralls,</hi> unto which of us next unto Man, our Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, precedency is due: And therefore when the <hi>Parliament</hi> and <hi>People</hi> of the World were divided in their judgements, and rent into such severall factions as could not be compos'd without a purge, they chose us from all the rest, and having empowered us by their Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, have given us instructions that we should appeale to you, as not onely our <hi>Lord Protector,</hi> but rationall and fit for Government, and that we should fully

remonstrate and report to your Highness the whole state and case of the matter brought before you, that you may at length from this Councell here present, choose one, who by his worth and service to Mankinde you should thinke fit for to name your <hi>Vice-Roy.</hi> In which honest and humble proposition we hope we shall not receive a denyall, and that after you have heard us all speake for our severall Rights, we expect your judgement, unto which we all humbly submit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To this when</hi> MAN <hi>had consented, and in his countenance and behaviour had shewn as much civility as hee possibly could;</hi> Open severally unto me, sayes he, your severall cases, for you have taken me in a day, which I had designed for a period and intervall of serious businesses, which notwithstanding I will bestow upon you, if I can by hearing and stating of your differences be a meanes of your peace, reconciliation or advantage. Speak then in the same order in which you came hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and first, you <hi>Calfe,</hi> when you have done I shall heare the <hi>Sheepe,</hi> then the <hi>Goose,</hi> then the <hi>Oyster,</hi> then the <hi>Bee,</hi> the <hi>Silkworme,</hi> and <hi>Flax,</hi> and then I shall call for <hi>Mercury,</hi> but one after another;

And the inducement which I shall offer to you shall be partly our labours, by which while we are so usefully assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, partly from those things which even during life we contribute from our own
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51761:9"/>
bodies, partly from the spoiles which are gathered from our Carkasses. On which three heads as so many setled arguments, I shall especiall insist, nor shall I one way or other vary from this method: <hi>THE LABOURS,</hi> O Man! which we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure for <hi>you,</hi> are extreamly great, and to any of our Competitors here present impossible and intolerable. For as to those that are absent I shall not much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate it, since the Election of <hi>King</hi> is limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to those here present, all the absent, be what they will, being in an incapacity. First of all then we are serviceable to Mankinde in tillage, which without us cannot at all or at the least so commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously be perform'd. I must confesse that we are not otherwise much imploy'd, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse it be for drawing of the Plow and Cart, but these are services so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, that they are infinitely more usefull then any other. For if the fields were not turn'd over and torne with Ploughs, painfully haled along upon our necks, it were impossible to sow the seed with any hope of harvest, which not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering expectation, I would know where man should have his subsistence.

not be very well content to returne to your diet of <hi>Acornes,</hi> or do you think you could be content for to live all your hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry dayes on such poore Ordinaries as Apples, Nutts and Hearbs? This I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve you would hardly be perswaded to, and since you have found by experience the necessity of bread, I necessarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the use of Oxen. Suppose our spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies were lost, there is a stop upon all husbandry, and instead of rich harvests of Corne, you shall have your fields pestered with weeds, and withall you must consider, how these Northerne Countries are supply'd with drink, marry Oates and Barley, and these come out of the Fields plough'd by us, I shall say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to Pease, or other kinde of fruits, which without stirring or preparing of the Earth were not to be expected, as Wheat, Spelt, Oates, Rice, Beanes, Pease, Vetches, Lintels, and others of that kind. All these are the fruits of <hi>Agriculture,</hi> and we next to man are the most effective in it. Besides, I need not tell you how great is the use of Wagons, which yet we draw in <hi>Italy</hi> (which if you will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <hi>Timaeus</hi> and <hi>Varo,</hi> had its name from an <hi>OXE,</hi> for in the ancienter <hi>Greek

And in many other places I cannot expresse how advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous we are, in drawing of loads from the Country to the City and back againe. And yet all these important services we performe meerely out of duty to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde; services I repeat it againe such, as I challenge any Creature to performe the thirtieth part of: So usefull I am sure the old wise <hi>Egyptians</hi> found us, that they heap'd all possible honours upon an <hi>Oxe,</hi> and gave him adorations proper to deities; And the reason was that the life of Man could not but be unpleasant without his assistance: The <hi>Oxe APIS</hi> as sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and priviledged had <hi>Vul an's</hi> Temple for his stall, where instead of an ordinary manger he had one of Gold, and of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture of straw, was provided for with fresh Tapestry, and when naturall death had taken him away, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

that professedly write of Husbandry, of all cattell is the most considerable. He is companion and fellow labourer with man in all businesses in the Countrey, and chiefe servant of the Goddesse <hi>Ceres,</hi> for which reason it was of old enacted, that no man should kill an <hi>Oxe,</hi> and the wise <hi>Romans</hi> had us in so much esteeme, that it was banishment for any man to kill one of us, though it were but to feed upon: and the reason is apparent; <hi>Bos comes</hi>

               <p>I shall now passe to those things which we yeeld during life for <hi>your</hi> use. These are our Dung and our Milk. Our dung indeed may seeme but a poore businesse, yet it is the food of the Fields that feed you, tis their joy, their recreation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which they are barren and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly. From this had <hi>Saturne</hi> (the great Grandsire as I may say of the Gods) his name of <hi>Stercurius,</hi> as a title of honour for his usefull invention of dunging the ground. That Arch.

not beene of very great moment might have been perform'd by other hands then those great and noble ones of immortall <hi>Hercules</hi> the Son of <hi>Jupiter.</hi> Neither is it onely that our dung fattens the fields, but it serves Man for medicine, and for fuell for fire instead of Wood or Coale: It is outwardly apply'd to a great many Maladies, as to the Gout in the hands and in the Feet, and indeed to any Gout whatsoever proceeding from a hot cause, and there is a Water distill'd from it in <hi>May,</hi> which is called the Water of all Flowers, which name is not given to any other Medicine whatsoever, be it never so precious, in the shop of any <hi>Apothecary.</hi> Not to tell you that <hi>Oxe</hi>-dung is most fortunately applyed to the resolving of all hard Tumours, and in Dropsies for drawing out of the restagnant Water. I need not to adde the benefits of it when taken into the body, as in the <hi>Jaundies</hi> and Diseases of that kinde, nor is it that you should be offended with the smell, for it is sufferable enough, and in Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens doth both refresh and nurse the sweetest and pleasantest hearbs and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, whether they be cherish'd there for their beauty, or their medicinall use. Then
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51761:11"/>
for want of fuell, how much it furnishes the hearts of severall people, and suffers them not to eat their Victualls raw, let the people, who enjoy the use of it, experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally confesse.</p>
               <p>For Milke and all those severall dainties it is varied into, I am at a stand, in respect I cannot sufficiently declare the profits of it. What I beseech you is more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to House keeping? What more agreeable to the life of Man? What more pleasant and more healthfull, not onely to all in health, but to most of the diseased? Of Cowes-milke you make Butter, Cheese, and Whey, three divers substances educ'd out of one matter, and they are of such excellent use of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, that that Table is indeed unfur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd which wants some of them. Nay even in the Scripture it selfe, that Land which was described to be greatly fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, was said to overflow rather with Milke then Honey; For Honey may be found in Desarts, and places untill'd, where plenty of Milke cannot be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. How many millions of men are there that live mostly of Cowes-milk? How many that live altogether on Cheese? What a vast income from hence is this to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51761:12"/>
some Countries! And indeed from what I have said will appeare, not onely bread, and Drinke, but also, Butter, Cheese and all things made of Milk, are the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions of our species, the last immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paid a Tax by us, the former obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Meditation of our paines: so that you, O Man, when you come to cast up your accompts, will finde all your conveniencies and enjoyments a debt to the <hi>Oxen,</hi> which that I may more clearly manifest, I shall instance those things which we yeeld by our death, after we have wasted our Lives in your ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
               <p>What vast emolument do we afford by our <hi>Flesh,</hi> our <hi>Entrayles, Fat, Bones, Hornes, Hides, Bladders, Haire,</hi> and other things which I think not worth the mentioning? For our flesh, 'tis not onely the dayly reliefe of the needy, but is the delicacy, and entertainment of the most sensuall. Let those people witnesse for me, that will acknowledge a piece of <hi>Beefe</hi> to be the bravest food, and eat as heartily for delight, as a hungry Man would do for necessity, thinking no means better to quiet and silence a barking and a craving stomack. Nor doe our Guts
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51761:12"/>
make worse fare; how many sorts of pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings and other Dishes are made out of them? As for our Tallow, it not onely serves for the making up of many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent services and Pies, but as I may say shares Empire with the Sunne, since it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords candles and light in his absence; which how inestimably it is to be valued I cannot say. For what benefits soever the Sun by his light scatters in the day, are generall and universall: now our Fat lighted, as it doth the same, so it doth more particularly, not refusing the obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest places or Chambers where the Sun possibly hath no accesse in the day, and entertaining us in the night, when by the rules of nature he cannot be present with us. Our <hi>Bones, Hornes, Bladders,</hi> and <hi>Haire,</hi> want not likewise their profits: what a many instruments are made of them, which I shall not attempt to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse (being willing to observe my time limited,) by reason of their variety and number. Bottles and Galley-pots, are clos'd with Bladders to prevent the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression of Aire, or the evaporation of the things enclos'd. Nor is our <hi>Haire</hi> use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse to the working of morter and many other occasions. Now for our <hi>Hides</hi>

flead off from our carkasse and well tann'd, in respect of the great advantage they bring, I can so little passe them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mentioning, that I confidently affirme they are one of the principallest <hi>utensills</hi> in Mans <hi>oeconomy,</hi> nay so principall, that were it out of no other reason, setting aside all that I have hitherto alledged, I would safely presume the diadem we contest for should be ours. Nor is it of one kinde onely, younger and elder are here serviceable, the one is stripp'd of his <hi>Skin,</hi> the other of his <hi>Hide,</hi> from whence else would you have your <hi>Boots, Shoes</hi> and <hi>Bellowes</hi> swelling with a <hi>Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany</hi> of wind?

And for other things their use is so knowne and necessary, that as a thing of knowledge I shall not otherwise mention. Now as for <hi>Calves-skins,</hi> I shall quote unto you but these two considerable utilities, (for the petty ones I shall passe.) In regard they are universally serviceable to M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The first is their use in Warre, by being made into Drummes, without which Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline could not be observed; the other is the subserviency to Arts, that is to say, that <hi>Bookes, Patents, Letters,</hi> or other <hi>Writings</hi> are made of them, and they are the Preservers, and Treasurers of Arts and Sciences faithfully conveying the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of former times into the minds and instruction of posterity. Now if all the World be governed by such Arts as owe their very preservation and tradition to a <hi>Calves-skin,</hi> who sees not the empire of all Worldly things given and devis'd unto <hi>us,</hi> as it were by last will and testament, from all Antiquity? I shall onely aske whether this may not be said to be the common memory of Mankinde, since it preserves things from age to age, when themselves cease to have a being, since it hands unto us all things necessary for knowledge, whether sacred or prophane, old or new, since in this wombe, as in a Treasury, are preserved all Lawes and Ordinances which are so essentially use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>States,</hi> that without them the frame of Government is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly dissolv'd. This furnishes and directs the Clergy with <hi>Hymnes</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thems</hi>

In a word, all the crafts and subtilties of States-men, all the truth and fidelity of Records, all the wholsome Prescriptions of Physick must be here necessarily deposited and preserved, and those Bookes that are fill'd with them are call'd faithfull Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellours and dumbe Teachers, for they cannot flatter men of Greatnesse, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be silent they teach; though they be lifelesse, yet they breath and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire Learning; and though they are mute, they speake all eloquence. And this is all that I have to say concerning those my superiours that have sent me hither, not doubting, my Lord <hi>Chancellour,</hi> that when you have fully considered all that I have remonstrated unto you, you will, after hearing how little the rest will bring to weaken my claime, vote me into that dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, for which before you I stand as Candidate.</p>

               <p>THE SHEEPE <hi>seeing the Eys and expectations of both Judge and As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly fixt upon him;</hi> Now (<hi>sayes he</hi>) it is my turne to speake, who am the meekest and mildest Creature that ever nature made: and if this vertue may not put in for the Crowne, 'tis vainly attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by peremptorinesse, and impudence. 'Tis not without great reason that we call tyrants <hi>Wolves,</hi> and that with a generall consent, for they like so many savage beasts (which are the most hatefull to us that may be) exercise all the cruelty they can against those that are in any subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to them; Which if once granted, the contrary Doctrine must be the more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, <hi>viz.</hi> That a <hi>Sheepe</hi> would prove the most mercifull <hi>King,</hi> and such as should be wish'd and obeyed by all. But if the greatest Deserts from Mankinde be that which must determine the case, and conferre the Soveraignty, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:51761:15"/>
by what hath been before alledg'd, there is no Creature whatsoever, that while living is more liberall, nor when dead yeilds greater advantage to Man, then the <hi>Sheepe,</hi> to which two heads I shall confine my speech. The <hi>Sheepe</hi> sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies mans necessities with its <hi>Wooll, Milk<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and <hi>Dung.</hi> The <hi>Milke</hi> is such an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage that it harldy gives place to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: We uncloath our selves to apparel Man, which is a Charity the greatest can be done to Mankinde. What greater act of mercy can there be done, then for us to bestow what is truely our owne upon another? Then to cloath the naked? Then to lend defence against the injuries and assaults of Summer and Winter? Our <hi>Wooll</hi> is taken away from us without any violence or resistance, nay we wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly permit it to be done: which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares in that when we are shorne we do not so much as bleat against the wills of our shearers. It is not therefore a prey taken from us, but a present given by us, the <hi>Sheepes Wooll</hi> is not the spoyle but the reward we owe to Man, who disposeth of it at his pleasure; Sometimes he caused it to be dyed in severall colours, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he workes it up severall wayes in
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:51761:15"/>
its native colour and fashion. View a man from the Crowne of his head to the sole of his foot, and thou wilt finde that whatever ornament he hath about him consists of our relicks. Looke but on his hat, that antient badge of Liberty, thou shalt finde it to be a circular texture of our <hi>Wooll:</hi> Look on his Coat, cloak or Cloaths, nay put in his very Stockins, they will prove so many <hi>woolly-coverings</hi> of his nakednesse. The whole man is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered and furnish'd with our presents, whence it should be inferr'd the greatest obligation he hath to any is to us, and consequently ought to passe his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for us: and as we have put him into possession of all that was ours, so is it but just he should give his verdict for us.</p>
               <p>Is it possible he can be guilty of no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes of that affection which we beare him? Or hath he lost all memory of the benefits we heape upon him? We are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a sort of Creatures neither injure nor intrench upon any other whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever: Grasse and the poorest shrubbs, are our nourishment, yet the benefits we returne to our Shepheards are not a few. I might here take occasion to boast of our <hi>Milke,</hi> as being the fattest, the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51761:16"/>
sweetest and most advantageous man is acquainted with: farre beyond that of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other Creatures; but my modesty obliges me to containe my selfe: This boyl'd with a little salt in it, thickens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an excellent and wholesome Sawce for divers meats. The <hi>Cheese</hi> that's made of it is extreame fat, and therefore becomes a great delicacy among many Nations. For the Dung, there is no man so much as doubts but that it is the welcomest to the ground of any, and that both Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen and Shepheards have well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, and that is the reason that our folds are so often removed, that by that meanes the whole Field may at length be sufficiently dunged. The ground of the Penns wherein we are shut up, when it comes to be digg'd up, confesse the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of our imprisonment, for its suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently Levened with <hi>Salt-peter,</hi> drain'd into it by the meanes of the Lie of our Urine, and by which that terrible receipt, by which <hi>Gun-powder</hi> is made, cannot be performed, that <hi>Powder,</hi> which being put in so Brasse Gunns, with Iron-bullets once set on fire, overthrowes the strongest <hi>Walls</hi> and <hi>Castles,</hi> and suffers not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position. Besides our Dung and the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51761:16"/>
Salt lately mentioned drawne from it, is an excellent medicine in severall Diseases, as inwardly the <hi>Jaundies</hi> and the like ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, outwardly in <hi>Scalds</hi> and <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,</hi> mingled with other things, it makes an excellent Plaister, and thus much good we afford during our Life.</p>
               <p>After death, behold our Lambs brought in their severall seasons, as matter of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and rarity at the greatest Feasts, we our selves constantly making part also of the furniture. Though I could wish men would rather follow the saying of that noble Emperour, <hi>That a good Shepheard ought to sheare and not to flay his Sheepe,</hi> notwithstanding we are perpetually sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crific'd to the palate of man, and those, whom the <hi>Scab</hi> or diseases destroy not, are led to slaughter, and made the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of Butchers. Our patience and serenity, even when death is before our eyes is singular, and exemplary: we make no resistance to the Executioner, but vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily offer our throats to his knife. Our flesh and fat helpe to make a share in the greatest Feasts, even where there is the most abundance of other dainties. Our Skinns employ the Skinners, who make of them not onely many usefull or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51761:17"/>
for Women, but many severall distinctions of Habits and Gowns for Men. Now if the <hi>Wooll</hi> were pull'd off them, as it serves for innumerable uses, so the bare pelt would be serviceable in an equell diversity, especially for Parchment, and Rolls for Records, in which benefit to Mankinde I am in all Justice a rivall equall with the <hi>Calfe,</hi> nay I stick not to affirme that for what praise he arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates to himselfe is not onely due to me, but in a larger and more especial manner, for I afford no assistance to the tumults of Warre as he doth, since Drummes, that are commonly made of his Skinne are not made of mine; but instead of that damnable subserviency to the rage and fury of Man, my bowels make strings for musicall Instruments, which charme his mind with a purer pleasure then the noise of <hi>Alarmes.</hi> Consider but the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Man, and see how it is fashioned and sympathiz'd to Harmony, since na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it seemes intended him not to be a <hi>Military Creature,</hi> since she did not as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe him any particular Armes to fight with, as shee hath done <hi>Lyons,</hi> whom shee hath made terrible by their teeth and clawes, <hi>Wolves</hi> and <hi>Beares</hi> formidable
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:51761:17"/>
with the thunder of their tuskes; <hi>Horses</hi> provok'd can revenge with their heeles, <hi>Bulls</hi> with their Hornes, but <hi>Man</hi> came naked and disarm'd into the World, in which he beares a great likelinesse to us, and we to him. But above all other things, hee seemes by a speciall preheminence of nature to be particularly enclin'd to Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick, which made divine <hi>Plato</hi> say, <hi>That he was not harmonically composed, that was not delighted with Harmony.</hi> Now we give such particular and eminent assistance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Musick, that we clearly outvie all other Creatures. Wee afford strings to the Lute and other instruments, which the finger of Man touches into so much har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and so entertaining with noble delight severall wayes, in the <hi>Phrygian, Jonick, Dorick</hi> and <hi>Lyidian</hi> moods; and according to the designe of Art raise and and allay severall passions. We shall say nothing of the greater and thicker strings, which men so diversly abuse; yet it is we that furnish them with strings too for Bowes, and give sury and force to their Arrowes, which if singly without the assistance of other Weapons determined the controversy between divers nations, &amp; have made lesser Nations bring greater
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51761:18"/>
into obedience, meerly through their want of skill and dexterity in them. These are also mighty usefull in the performing of sundry Handicrafts, but I shall wave par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, but one there is that I cannot omit, that one parcell of our body, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyes the greatest <hi>Wolfe</hi> of all Mankind, or to say better his Whelps, least the World by encrease of such <hi>Wolves</hi> might be destroy'd by them, which words, if you conceive to have too much of riddle in them, I thus explaine. What greater <hi>Wolfe</hi> than the <hi>Turke,</hi> he strangles his Brothers, and it may be his sonnes with a string made of our Guts: that he may tyrannise alone. Now if these things have any consideration with you, I may mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destly say that I possesse those vertues, which carry the greatest conformity to man, as Meeknesse, Patience, Innocency of Life and Simplicity; and if you looke on my services to Mankinde I know not who can compare with me, let them be of what ranke or species whatsoever.</p>

               <p>Why should not we therefore carry away the <hi>Diadem,</hi> and the Title Royall from those that are not for this to be compared with us?

life of bruites, mankind would have been as unacquainted with himselfe and things, as Children shut up in a Cave and there continued. Now all those that have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the reputation of wise, learned and experienc'd Men, and have arrived at the Arts and Sciences, have done it by the advantage of our <hi>quills.</hi> These are they that governe the World, with their lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning policy and science, which have been only propagated by Penns, the use where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of whosoever know not are accounted of a contemptible condition and disesteem'd. Pens often rescue the most despicable po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty into vast wealth, Pens throw ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and lustre on wealth it selfe, nay there is no condition; which receives not ornament and advantage from them. Pens comprise and establish all humane Lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature; what anciently was with difficulty put down with an Iron bodkin, is now more easily perform'd by Pens; what honour was ever given to learning by the greatest Princes, is now due to Pens, and to those to whom they are owing, <hi>Geese.</hi> Whence I infer that our esteem ought to be such, that it should be farre more considerable than to receive a denyall in this claime of Royalty.

And in this consideration we must needs appeare to be not onely subservient to Religion, but very contributary to Man himselfe, in which double discharge of out duty, we farre out-strip all other. For private houses none will call it in question, that hath been in the Palaces and Hostel's of Kings and Princes, at whose tables in the night we diligently watch, consuming our selves to be serviceable to them, which istruly the character of a King, and therefore owing to us as the authors of so great a benefit.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it must be remembred, that in all medicines outwardly, applyed to the body of man, as in plaisters, salves, and ointments; it is Wax that gives its assistance and that to all affections of parts and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases; besides, the oyles that are drawn
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:51761:31"/>
from it, are of very great use. The last, but most considerable, is, that the Ancients had waxen Tables, and Bookes enriched and embellished with all kindes of Sciences, and at this day, as formerly men preserve Seales, those faithfull wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses of all contracts impressed upon it, to the great profit of all Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-wealths. As for Books and Tables, all agree, that are vers'd in Antiquity, how they were used, before searchfull and restlesse man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde had found out other things to write upon: For then, in tables covered with Wax, or else upon Linnen, temper'd with it, they engraved and writ all their busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse with a sharp Puncheon, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed them away by Courriers. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Kings and Princes, and all others whatsoever, were enforced to make use of our help for the communicating of Counsell, and our spoyles were their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours. And not so onely, but vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes of Wax were the great conserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of all Arts and Sciences, especially Lawes; without which, the life of man is miserable and belluine. Now it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, how much the impression of Wax, upon a Seale, hath force and authority; nothing is firme and constant in all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacts,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:51761:32"/>
unlesse Wax, as Umpire, close up the league; unlesse Bees, with the ruine of part of their owne dwelling-houses, gave them strength, force and vertue: Therefore as all humane things are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by Wax, so are they preserved and confirmed, not by a waxen, but rather Adamantine Chaine. For it was truly said of the Poet,</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Pan primꝰ calamus cerâ conjungere plures Instituit.</l>

                     <hi>Pan</hi> was the first taught many reeds to joyne with Wax, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </l>
               </lg>
               <p>For all humane businesses, if we well minde it, are by this coagulated and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented together: for what any man hath promised to another by his Seale impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in Wax, whether it be for service, or debt, or mean promise, it is the ligament and the tie that <hi>Pan,</hi> that is to say, all businesse requires. Let my Competitors, the Calfe, Sheep, and Goose, flourish out their deserts in this kinde, this is a busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse proper onely to me. What are Letters without Seales? Marry what Bels are without Clappers. What are Men without Faith? Shades and Spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:51761:32"/>
nay things civilly dead. Pray what are Calves or Sheep-skinnes made with a great deale of doe into Parchment, and scribled with Goose-quils, which have made such a noyse, to what end or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose are they, unless we afford them Wax for their Labels? None at all; nay if the Wax be but taken off, or broken, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced, they are taken as invalid, and not writ It is Wax therefore that gives them credit, &amp; brings them into reputation, that they may be valid; take it once off, and they are imployed in the most sordid us<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Therefore no man is doubtfull of recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring any thing that is past under another mans Seale, since by this meanes, the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting which in it selfe is dead and unactive, recovers life and strength. While we are speaking of seals, it must also be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, how much other Images and Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks are concerned in it. In many Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, we observe many Images meerly cast of Wax, as also in prophaner places, where they had the Statues of themselves and Ancestors religiously preserved in an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly Series. Hence, even in <hi>Rome</hi> it self, they were called <hi>fumosae cerae,</hi> that is, smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kie wax-Images, and he was accounted of the most ancient and noble Family that
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:51761:33"/>
could produce most of them, and on the contrary otherwise. Besides, there are often made Images to the life, coloured after severall manners; which, since they are as various as individualls them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, I forbeare to mention. From what I have said will be easily evin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For in our Monarchy (I fear me I shall not have time enough to insist at large) there is so much Majesty, Prudence, and harmony of Order, that even Man himselfe may seeme from us to have learned the Arts and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of Monarchical Government, rather than we from him, as many Writers have affirmed. Our King is borne with marks so visible, both by his beauty, bignesse, and singular wisdome, yet without sting or passion, that we all yeild an unanimous obedience, and never acknowledge any but himselfe: 'Tis on him we labour, as our Governour; 'tis for him doing ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, and disposing of affaires in his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace-royall in the midst of his Hive, that
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:51761:33"/>
we attend; 'tis for him, when he makes his Cavalcade, that we joyne together to make a triumph; nor doe we ever break the order in which we are marshall'd, without his particular command; we wait on him out, we bring him back. This and other things of this nature, some specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive men have looked upon with so much admiration, that relinquishing all other businesse, they have spent all their dayes in this imployment, manifestly inferring the ineffable wisdome of the divine dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser of all things from this one demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

many changes? From a little seed warm'd by the heat of the Sun, or the breasts of Virgins, there are produced certain little Wormes, both living and active. These in the Spring-time, being laid open in the lesser leaves of Mulberry-trees, daily, like other worms, encrease and enlarge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves every way, till at length they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come very great wormes, and of divers colours. This is our rise, this the manner of our birth, which is therefore admirable, that an Insect with four wings sheds that seed, and a little Worme is produced by it. There is a very great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween these two Animals, yet one is the Cause and Womb of the other; But that is the excellent artifice which is woven out of the bowels of this Worm, while it lies glutted and surcharged with the juice of the leaves of Mulberries: For it begins to spin and winde up about it selfe certain silken threds, which no imitation of man can possibly follow. These threds are reeled by man, and gathered into divers skaines, which are imployed in severeall uses, the utilty whereof, how great it is I cannot so well demonstrate, it is so vast and large. The Raw-silk undied is pale and yellowish, but by dying is taught to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:51761:35"/>

Hence are there threds wound up to a thousand uses, and some woven into stuffs of different kinds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Hence see you so many different Silkes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> differently made with great workmanship which employ the heads and hands of most Artificers, who severally, as their Genius and designe leads them, disguise us into things suitable to the pleasure or profit of Man. Consider, I pray you, onely this, how many men, women, and children, earn their bread by our service, that is to say, by unweaving what we weave to their hands: Hence the Diers and their great families live meerly by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us service, that they may change and vary the Fruits of our Labours into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers colours. Next to these, the Weavers have a share, who with our skaines once died, make Stuffs, and Taffata's of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent natures. Hence comes Velvet, and indeed all other kind of Silks whatsoever. These come to be bought by the Mercers, and make a great part of his stock, being afterwards dispersed into severall Nations and Cities, for the use of Man: And these foure sorts of people are so populous and excessive in number, that there is no Prince, be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he never so potent, be his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions

him with the same speeches and gestures, with the same courtship and submission that they used toward the Duke himselfe; they asked him what clothes he would weare that day, and withall, shewed him severall rich suits, that he might make his choice. The fellow at the first was plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in a million of doubts, whether this was a vision or no; he could not be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied within himselfe about the place, or whether he was the man they intended, or himself was changed from his former person into another; but when he saw that persons of honour attended him with precise obedience, and who with all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, demanded of him, whether his Highness would be pleased to rise and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to his wonted excercises; He began to be really perswaded, that himself was the Duke they intended. Having there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore put on one of the Dukes suits, and finding it fit for him, he was confirmed in his belief, that he was the Master of so many Servants, and (wonder at that so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain impression made upon his spirit) the most powerfull Prince of the whole Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; then with a great train following him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he is conducted to the Park adjoyning to the Palace, then to the Fish-ponds, then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

to Breakfast, after that he spent his time in visiting other places, discoursing about severall matters, in which whole occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence the slave as to shape and habit, counterfeited the Duke well enough; but his understanding and the rest of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment, spoke him (what really he was) a Cobler. At length he is solemnly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led on to dinner, where there bore him company the greatest Beauties of the Court, and men of the best Quality; thence is he brought abroad to hunt, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by all the Court, furnished with the best Doggs, and mounted on the best Horses. At his return supper staid for him, where he was intertained with varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of choisest dishes, and while they about him very ceremoniously drunk his health in the strongest Wine, he very naturally (as loving it with all his heart) became as drunk as before, and fell into a sleep that approacht death as neare as possible, then D. <hi>Philip,</hi> (who all this while among the Courtiers, had attended the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in a disguise, whilest the other sustai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the person of a Prince) commanded him to be clothed againe in his former vestments, and to be carried to the place from whence he was brought, and there
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:51761:37"/>
left. This late Duke measured out the night with a sound sleep, but when he awak'd and found his lodging changed he began to be very doubtfull of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, enquiring of himselfe whether he were he that he now seemed, or rather that Duke which he lately thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: but when he could not otherwise perswade himselfe, there being present so many circumstances, especially his torne and old clothes to convict him, that he was a mean Cobler, but more in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard there was nothing at all to witnesse he had been a Duke, he returned home and related unto his wife the adventure as a Dreame he had had the last night, that he had been in the Dukes Palace, how he had been treated, how he recreated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe with walking and hunting, how he had fared, and (in short) All. From all which it is apparent, that garments made of our silk, have a strange power of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion upon the mindes, not onely of them that weare them, but also upon the beholders of the quality and worth of the persons; For many when they see them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves laden with the spoyls of Silk-worms, although they be men of the meanest rank, and of soules not tinctur'd with the

different passions should attend silken garments? Indeed I see no other reason, but those severall accidents and usages by which silk is varyed, by dying, by wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, by sewing. By dying, because the colours with which we are inbued, are not onely divers, but of divers properties; some are made of Vegetables, some of Mineralls, nay indeed, some of animalls themselves, in all these, there is a severall variety which differently touches and works upon the heart. The Red and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are belived to be very restorative unto it: so others also imprint their little influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences upon it, though it be not so easie to assigne the Reason<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And it is very pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, that by weaving such an effect may likewise happen: but especially by sew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we see the figure and new shape of any new matter, gives it a great deale of grace. Now by the shape of any thing, the heart is easily won to esteem, or any other passion: Whatever is the cause, be it in the matter, be it in the form, be it in the subject it self, that is to say, the body, or the minde of Man; 'tis the same thing, since we by our Threads contribute no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to it, unlesse there be some hidden cause in it which is too nice and subtill for
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:51761:40"/>
my indagation. This I know, our diet is Mulberry-leaves, and methinkes they should not nourish us with any pride: But Man using our threads laboured and spun out of the leaves of trees, not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting his ancient nakedness in Paradise, which he would have covered with Fig. leaves, seemes to be proud now that he has found out so excellent a remedy, as instead of them to be cloathed with the leaves of Mulberry, lest he might appeare naked, or, according to his old barbarity, be glad of a Sheep-skin. For my part I shall not much presse it home unto him, that he uses onely the leaves of a Mulber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tree, transformed and altered in the maw of a Worm; and thus onely to hide his nakednesse, to dis-esteeme the simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of his first Fathers, or that it is but justice that he should be covered with the excrements of Worms, who is after to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come their nourishment: Man in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very prudent to consider, first what he was when he came into the world naked, and what he shall be after death, either putrefactive, or putrefaction: and if we well consider it, I may well inferre, that we are noble, and of a nature friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to man, when we prevent his unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:51761:40"/>
by covering him with our labours, and furnishing him with good instruction, rather than offensive to him, in putting him in minde of his fragility by our own. What is more noble and generous than Man? What more wise, more prudent? Yet he himselfe acknowledges, that we are not unworthy to provide him fleeces, and furniture to cover and adorn himself, whereby to heighten and manifest his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation: Therefore I know none who will deny us to be most noble creatures, since we adde nobility unto the noblest: 'Tis nothing that the <hi>Sheep</hi> be she <hi>English</hi> or <hi>Spanish,</hi> or of any other Country, should bring his Wools in competition with us, since we have had priority of esteem, by prescription of long time, and keep at the present possession: 'tis fit therefore the <hi>Sheep</hi> do homage to the <hi>Silk-worm,</hi> and not the contrary: We, as fed with the leaves of tall trees, whilst they, content with roots, and a little short grasse, are penn'd up in bare and barren pastures; there we seated in an higher fortune, derived by nobler birth, and better nature, leave our rich fleeces to serve the magnificence of Man; they are of an inferiour condition to their

               <p>But if any one may speak of the adva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tages rendred unto Man, no doubt the praehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence of Flax will oretop all the rest. And although it be not easily acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modated to that end, But requires abundance of Labor in the preparation, yet once obtain'd, it is crown'd with the greatest advantages, nay so great that the life of Man would be much more sad and disadvantagious with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it; and therefore they have thought it no matter of shame to imploy all their industry in their severall managements of it, in order to fit it to their own use, which doubtlesse they had never done, had they not been allured by great hopes, and confirmed by equall successe; for all things which in themselves are handsome and good, and least noxious, are scarce and rare, and seldome obtain'd by Man, but after the greatest difficulties, and hardest labours, as is witnessed by <hi>Hesod, That the Gods place Sweat before Glory,</hi>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:51761:42"/>
and the old <hi>Romans</hi> permitting any man to set his foot into the temple of Honour, before they had past through the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Vertue. Nay, even in common things, before we can eat the Nut, we must first crack it, and throw away the shells; So before man can use Flaxe to the best advantage, it must be so prepar'd, that first the seeds must be thrown into a ground excellently well manur'd, and when 'tis growne up so much as to carry the shape of a plant, it must be often freed from some other more unworthy weeds as may pester it. When tis ripe, then 'tis to be pluck'd up, then the seeds are to be separated by drawing them through combes or rakes; next, these being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd, all the rest must be macerated in water, that it may putrifie for almost 12. dayes. Then it must be laid in some dry and windy place, that it may be dry'd ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Sunne, Winde, or Ayr. After this drying of it, it must further endure the heate of a Furnace, till it become fragile and friable, then it must be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and pounded, not all, but the grosser part of it, for there will remaine a rind, which cannot be broken, as being of too ductile and easie a substance. Then must it
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:51761:43"/>
be separated by wooden Cleavers, as it were with Hatchets, or to say better, the hard substance made more soft, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the thinner parts. Then is it fit that it be kem'd through with <hi>Iron-Hatchels,</hi> and next that, by finer than these, it be purg'd from his thicker and shorter threads, that so at length it may be fit to be spun: Then is it wound up into Hankes to be wash'd, both with Water and Lee, and when once dry'd, is brought together into bundles, which by the meanes of the Weaver are made Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen, which having try'd both the Sunne, and Raine, and Water, is purg'd into a curious whitenesse; and lastly, it coms to be appropriated to the use of man, by cutting it, and stitching it together. The profit of this Linnen, which is so excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly various, is obtain'd through all this labour; and I beleeve nothing in all the world needs so much preparation, therefore it was very fit I should have mentioned it.</p>
               <p>What the <hi>Silkeworme</hi> hath said of her threds may be possibly true, but if they were to be made serviceable by so many tedious wayes, I cannot but imagine they would be of rarer use; yet all this hath so
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:51761:43"/>
little affrighted mankinde, that by how much their paines are greater, they have been so much the more pleasant in obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the use of <hi>Flaxe,</hi> of which I shall say little and briefly; The profits of it are so many, both in the seed, threads, or Linnen made of them, nay of Linnen it selfe after it hath been decay'd. In the Seed, either for it selfe, or for the Oyle drawne out of it: in it selfe, as in medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, the seed is applyed for emolliency and maturation; the Oyle extracted from it, is of so piercing a tenuity, that it can onely be preserv'd in Glasses or Bladders, not in any Earthen Vessells, be they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so well prepar'd, for it sweats and evaporates through them.</p>
               <p>The use of this Oyle extends it selfe to the tempering of Colours, and severall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, besides what it is in Physick, but all these I passe by. I proceed to threads, which are of various use both to tye and binde up any thing, or to stitch up any thing, whether it be for use or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament. Nay, there are made from them severall Stuffes, though they be not called Linnen, such as are Linsey-wolsyes, and Kersies, and Silkes, and halfe Silkes, which serve not onely for Cloaths, but other
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:51761:44"/>
uses of Men. But Linnen above all the rest is the most desir'd and priz'd. Man might want the others, or supply himself with something in their stead, but if he wanted Linnen (as unexperienc'd Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty did before it knew how to use <hi>Flaxe</hi>) he would be oblig'd to a great deale of troublesome and vexatious labour.</p>
               <p>For to instance in the first place, Shirts and Wascoats, if he wanted them, we should be forced to use onely Woollen, from whence we should have a great pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction arise from the Wool taken from the Beasts, by the warmth of the skin into durt and foetor, from whence we should have Wormes plenty enough, or the Lousie disease, which once creeping upon him, would either engage him to change his Cloaths often, or every day be troubled with the voydance of so much nastinesse as we know by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, for those that use Woollen next their skin, are the most subject to this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, a thing not knowne where they weare good Linnen, and that often chang'd.</p>
               <p>Hence in former times, when the use of Linnen was not so common, as it is in this age, they were forc'd in <hi>Italy</hi> (where
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:51761:44"/>
the warmer aire did in Summer cause their bodies to transpire more) every day to wash themselves, which occasion'd so many magnificent Baths to be built in <hi>Rome</hi> and other places, in which the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours themselves often, and all people else wash'd themselves, and so spent their time in Frictions and unctions, as though they had been borne for no other end<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nay many there were, who, content to abuse this matter of necessity, into an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment of pleasure, were so immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in it, that <hi>Galen</hi> the Emperour is said to wash foure or five times a day, which I would not have said as if I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood not but that the old <hi>Romans</hi> knew what <hi>Linnen</hi> was, but that I would inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate that it was in greater esteeme, and rarer use then it is at present. Thus we read that <hi>Caesar</hi> cover'd the whole <hi>Roman Forum</hi> with Linnen, <hi>Virgil.</hi> l. 1. Georg.</p>

                  </gap>he chiefe end of all the paines, and hardy exercise, was only the preservation of cleannesse of Body. But afterward custome and habit of these things, turn'd it into another nature, and made it be believ'd as necessary for Health, which may hence appear, that without Lotions and clearing the Body of its frequent superfluities, they were so pestered, that they contracted the disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses I have mentioned, and by this meanes the whole day was unprofitably spent in Bathings, Frictions, Unctions, sweating exercises, Wrastlings, and Dauncings, especially by those great ones that seem'd
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:51761:46"/>
to live for no other end but to please themselves, when all others of a meaner rank, they were forc't by the sweat of their brows to earne their bread, seldome or never cleansing themselves by such chargeable wayes, were vext with an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred diseases, which may well make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that the life of man is very misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and uncomfortable without the use of Linnen, which we finde to have been not onely the experience of former Ages, but the misery of some Nations at present, which I conceive I have demonstrated e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to the ignorant themselves. For in purging of Linnen, they are of so diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent a Nature from the Body of Man, that filth is not so easily contracted and putrified into Wormes, whereas it is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise in Silke and Cloath: The clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse of Man is therefore chiefly to be attributed to Linnen, to which that must be solely attributed, and is withall that which defends him from those humours, which in it self it drys up. And conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently we are to infer all that time, which men of all Ages and Qualities wast in Bathings and idle care of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, whilst their greater businesse, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Studies, Imployments or Devotions,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:51761:46"/>
are neglected, is now meerly owing to us, as a benefit so mainly conducible to the commodious Conduct of life. But if Princes were to Bathe foure or five times a day, and so often to be rubb'd or exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis'd in so many manners, allowing them their times of eating, I should aske of you when they should be at leisure to assist in the weightiest Counsells for the welfare of their Subjects? When shall they heare the Petitions and the cryes of the oppressed poor? When shall they judge them? When shall they relieve them? Not to speak of the lesser points of their duties. The use of Linnen therefore is absolutely as necessary as bread, nay, I say, more profitable, the want of bread may be endured, Nay, recompenc'd with other delicacies, but the want of Linnen cannot possibly. In Tables and Beds they yeild the same cleanlinesse, as also in Towels, Shirts, and Hankerchiefs: and thus much for their necessity.</p>
               <p>But if we will consider the habit of women, and the pride they solely derive from hence, we shall finde that by seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall kindes of Linnen, they appeare not onely so acceptable and gracefull, but they appeare as ugly and contemptible
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:51761:47"/>
without it, but I rather choose to wave this Topick, in respect I am afraid I am not able to enlarge it according to the merits of its cause. To all this we shall adde, (though very briefly) two other uses of Linnen, whereof no Antiquity hath been ignorant, to wit, that all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation, which stretches as far as the world it selfe, hath been perform'd by Linnen and Canvas sailes. <hi>Virg.</hi> 3. <hi>AEneid.</hi>

What we have for the present said, for the use of Linnen, while it is whole, though we have in a manner but touch'd at it, and cursorily argued, may I thinke suffice: but when Linnen hath been

so oft foul'd and apply'd to so many uses, and that so long, till it fall in pieces, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a new production. For the raggs both of Linnen and cloth, be they never so much sullied, or torne, are gathered together to be carryed to the Paper-mill, where they make their choice and wash them, and then steep them in water till they be in a manner putrified, then they beat them into a kinde of poultice, which being made very thin, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sprinkled with water, or laid upon little nets of Wire, is made Paper, whether it be course and fit to wrap Wares in, or Writing Paper, or Royall Paper; which being once dry'd, smooth'd, spread, and done with Allome water, brings innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable helps to the conversation of man. I beseech you now let Calves-skins<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sheeps<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skins, the waxen table, which the <hi>Calfe, Shee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:51761:48"/>
but I shall say there is no man that can be ignorant, that Books and Letters are written in Paper, and printed in such a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance, that the Skins of any other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals, nor waxe would be able to supply so great a defect. By the use of Paper, the world hath enlarg'd the use of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, Arts, and Sciences, and indeed all other excellencies. Now though we should grant that the Antients writ in plates of Mettalls or Waxe, or in the barkes of Trees, or in leaves of the Paper of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> or indeed upon the Skins of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, yet scarce any man could possibly atchieve the use of so many books, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the greatest toyle, irksomnesse and cost; or carry them with him from place to place, although he were a Man of a most plentifull estate. From whence we must necessarily inferre, that in that time men of lower Fortunes were withdrawn and deterr'd from their Study, by those two great difficulties, the matter upon which they should write, and the dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Bookes. To instance, <hi>Ge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>metri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> were then forc'd to make their fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures upon the Sand, that was therefore called the wisest part of the Earth, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in <hi>Archimedes</hi> (who also while he
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:51761:48"/>
was in the Bath, drew Figures in Oyle upon his owne body) who whilst he was in contemplation of some Diagramm's drawn in Sand, was slaine at the taking of <hi>Syracuse</hi> by the Soldiers of <hi>Marcellus.</hi> Others that were very poore, have made use of severall things, whereupon they might write the Lectures of their Masters, as <hi>Cleanthes</hi> did the hoofes of Mules and divers other things. But at the present, we have such abundance of what may serve them in this kinde, that meerly by the Courtesie of <hi>Flaxe,</hi> the poorest man may have enough wherewithall to read, whereby to learne, and wherein he may dispose all things he hath either read, or hath been taught.</p>
               <p>And hence it comes, that so many Arts and Sciences have ascended into their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian, not by the use of Parchment or Waxe, but of Paper onely. To Paper I say you must ascribe it, you, whoever are embellish'd with pure literature or so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Science, if your many and noble Books reach all Posterity, and oblige un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your selves an eternall memory which will preserve both your names and works. For I must tell you, the use of Paper hath as much distinguish'd that of Pelts and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:51761:49"/>
Wax, as the invention of Bread did that of Acornes. All Princes and Noble men study only Paper, to which they trust their most dark Counsells, never considering that they are made of the most durty rags of Linnen. For as a Potter once, came to be a King, and his golden Close-stool be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came an Idoll to the people, so the most shatter'd raggs of Linnen are made Paper, which Princes are proud to guild and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive for addresses. The businesse of the greatest Councellours of Kings, lyes only in poring upon Papers, and by this means they talk with dumb Teachers. What needs many words? Empires, Kingdomes, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities are govern'd by Papers, all bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesses entrusted unto them, and by that meanes preserv'd from Oblivion. The trust of the Chancery is to preserve these, out of which Papers once being let fly like Doves out of the Ark, they command, prohibit, perfect and enjoyne all that Law and Equity requires. Papers therefore are the Messengers of Law, and Equity, which though silent speak, and though inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent betray all deceits. In Papers the Physitians make their prescriptions, and therefore we may well call them the Causewayes to health. In Papers the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:51761:49"/>
Philosophers write their Theorems, and bring them home to the eyes of their Schollars; so that we need not Sand or any other matter to blot and scratch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and therefore may conclude Paper to be the wisest of any thing. To Paper Lovers trust all their blandishments, and all their Courtships, and how oft do they receive the happinesse of a Kisse, which it may be the sender onely lives in hope for?</p>
               <p>By Paper, one friend whispers himselfe in the eare, and enjoyes his distant Soule at distance. And indeed if Man first trusted his Body to Linnen before ever he knew that Paper was thought upon, now since it is found out, he findes it the onely fit messenger to which he thinkes fit to trust his minde, and of this must <hi>Flaxe</hi> onely glory; this is one of the most faithfull of Man's life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard, to which as the most faithfull Scout, he hath entrusted and resigned himselfe like some antient Princes, or else some moderne, to a <hi>German</hi> cohort.</p>

Therefore unto me, as the most profitable to Man, as without whom he could not onely live well, but must live very miserably, to me, without whom, neither Arts nor Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, nor affaires of Man in any condition, could either be delivered or received, I affirme this Diadem we now strive for, to be due above all the rest.

I shall
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:51761:51"/>
not study to gratifie my Competitors by contracting or cutting off any thing that conduces to my purpose, but rather shall be engaged in necessity copiously, (with your permission) to discourse of all such things, as I may conceive essentiall &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall to insist upon, <hi>which when the</hi> Judge <hi>had granted,</hi> now I shall very easily (<hi>sayes Mercury<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> save the rest a Labour of ever (for the future) disputing the prerogative either with me, or among themselves; For my nobility of Birth I shall not say much, though I finde some that have spoke before have very much pleased themselves in this Topick, I shall content my selfe to insist onely upon the utility which I bring to Man, which is the rule of speaking prescribed. But this is so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mense and so rich, that like the Prince of Rivers, the <hi>Nile</hi> (which dischargeth it selfe by a seven-fold streame unto the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterranean Sea) spreads and divides it self into so many branches, according to the number of Metallick formes, which meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly draw their rise and being from me. That I may therefore speak for my selfe, I shall first mention these halfe Metalls produc'd by my means Secondly of Lead, thirdly, of Tinne, fourthly of Copper, fifthly of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:51761:52"/>
Iron, sixthly of Silver, seventhly of Gold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For what concernes my selfe, I will justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie I am in the greatest capacity to serve Man. Not to lose time in representing unto you the vaine and unprofitable workes of common Chymists, whilst they labour about me, being but rude and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile. I must confesse all this toyl is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable, and neither Laudable nor Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, yet notwithstanding out of all this erroneous practice, there results an Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity of considerable advantages, foure where of I shall chiefly select, First, That I am imployed in separation of Gold and Silver; Secondly, For Guilding and Silvering; Thirdly, In other Mechanicall Workes, and lastly, in Physick. Now by my meanes is that Gold brought into a body, which lyes scatteredly dispersed in the Mudd or sediment of Rivers or Pools, and there is a Masse of People, that by this meanes hunt Gold, as one would say out of the Waters, wherein their subtile and curious particles are strangely mixt, and upon tryall subside all below in the mauner of dregs. And by this meanes in <hi>Hungary, Sclavonia,</hi> and other Nations, where Rivers steere their course from mountaines impregnate with Gold, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:51761:52"/>
in <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Silesia,</hi> they are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered into a body meerly by the help of <hi>Mercury,</hi> that is to say, those small Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Gold, which are washt and gnaw'd away from the main substance, by the violence of the waters, and by their motion dispersed, are by this meanes ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, united and bodyed, which were impossible without <hi>Mercury.</hi> For he, like an indulgent Mother of Gold, when ever she findes her Son gadding through other Elements or Waters, carefully takes it into his lappe, untill he restore it unto it selfe, and either direct it what to doe, or what to declare, no otherwise than <hi>Virgil. AEneid</hi> 1. feigns <hi>Venus</hi> to appeare before her Sonne <hi>AEneas</hi> wandring in the woods neare <hi>Carthage,</hi> and bring him into the right way.</p>
               <p>Gold being therefore gathered into a deductible substance, <hi>Mercury</hi> is perco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated through Leather, and made ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to the same end againe. Now is Gold melted in the Fire, and so reduc't to its fresh continuity, that Gold so colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and gathered together in so great quantities, is to be ascribed to <hi>Mercury,</hi> that is to say, my selfe; otherwise it had perisht or been neglected or lost, and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:51761:53"/>
consequently never have been serviceable unto Man; and in this point, I appeale only to Experience. Thus onely profit sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts all other considerations, in the like manner the Silver that is gathered out of the Mines of <hi>Peru,</hi> beaten and mingled with Quick-silver, returnes it self in incredible plenty, as may appeare by the reports of those that have seen and manag'd it, and indeed the increase is so great, that it infinitely exceeds any Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. In the same manner Gold, though it be mouldred and brought into the most insensible particles by any Mill or Engine, is by this meanes brought together in case any remaine, and this by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of <hi>Mercury,</hi> as the Reconciler and Peace-maker. Any man may from hence thinke, that the defect of <hi>Mercury</hi> may be supplied with a violent heat, which might cause liquefaction, but in this they are deceived, for by reason of the Earthy and Clammy substance, in which the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer Allomes are immixt and buryed, it were impossible to make a right separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the single use of Fire.</p>
               <p>Now for Guilding and Silvering, I my selfe, <hi>Mercury</hi> am the sole Agent, for without me all endeavours of Artists are
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:51761:53"/>
fruitlesse, and the reason is, the likenesse of my substance with that of Gold and Silver; And this is not the least of my profits, that although Men by way of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stentation, may make use of Silver, or other kinde of Plate, yet they enforce me to serve either their use or Magnificence: I am also imployed in abundance of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanicall operations, some use me in Fishing, for the light and splendor I throw about me; some use me for the fourbishing of Armes; some for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter moving and poizing of Engines, which particularly to insist on, I thinke not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary in this place: But in Medicine I contribute such admirable advantage un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Man. When I am pulveriz'd either with Gold or any other Body (so it be not corrosive or noxious) that I am the best Purgative Nature hath given us. This dust, although it be but meanly prepar'd, as it hath the name and attribute of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relian</hi> is a <hi>Panchymagôgon</hi> [a Generall Medicine] which I cannot aver to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose without a particular discourse of all particular Physick; yet see here, most sage Judge, to make good this point, I shall deliver some things that may very much conduce to the service of your selfe
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:51761:54"/>
and the rest of your Brethren, and my method shall be this; <hi>First, I will tell you the vertue of this</hi> Aurelian <hi>powder, then of the use and way of Administration, and lastly, I shall mention its admirable opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and effects. For the first, as to its ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues it is highly Soveraigne for all these dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases and affections, which proceed from any humours, whether antecedent or restaynant. With</hi> time, <hi>they are immunerable, I shall not bring them hither upon a precise ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt, but onely in generall, that it roots out and chases away all putrid Feavours, Gouts, Swellings and Obstructions of any part, as also the great Pox, Palsies, lesser Apoplexyes, Hypocondriack, Melancholy, palenesse and Jaundise in Women, the Jaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise, Chachexys, and growing Dropsies, for drawing out and evacuating any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours descending unto, and fermenting in the Bladder; which it does most power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, whether it be Wind, Phlegme, Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler or Melancholy, as any matter Joyntly-Coagulated by them: In the Gout, it is the surest remedy which may well suffice, since under that name there are almost an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred diseases compriz'd, though frequently lurking under more Common or different shapes: In Fluxes, inflamations and the

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:51761:55"/>
any thing either in the Spoon or the Throat, wash it so often with the same liquor, till you have drunke it all, and are sure to have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the full Dose: But this must be done in the morning, keeping your selfe warme in Bed, neither sleeping, eating, nor drinking upon it. But in case of necessity it may be taken out of Bed, and businesse may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spatch'd, some, as melancholy persons may stirre abroad (if the skie be clear) and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in health. It is given without any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to all ages, as to children of two or three years old; nay to old Men, in whom you must consider abundance of Humours, lest they be too much stirred, but in children there needs not so much Caution: Thirdly, for the Operation it is thus, if the Ayre be warme, or the Patient keep himself so, and drinke warme broths, if he have a full body the humours work well and Plentifully; otherwise, if the Ayre be cold, and he keep not himselfe warm, nor make use of an hot Vehicle, and his body be thin and extenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, this Medicine will work much lesse, or not at all: if any should suddenly sleep, drink, or eat upon it, or casually take it in Pills, he would not want acquaintance of the effects of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="99" facs="tcp:51761:55"/>
violently, moderately, or not at all; it never does any harme, for it hath not the Nature of other violent Purgatives, to doe mischiefe, in case it faile of Operation: But commonly this is the effect of it, after you have taken it in a fitting liquor, if the disease be Phlegme or any crude matter, this, though it be thick, tough, and clammy, is drawn out of the Mesariack veines, and the parts ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent into the bottom of the Stomack, where the Medicine seats it self, where if any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable quantity be gathered, there ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses a little loathing, which if it encrease, it causes a desire of vomiting, which provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and causing frequent spitting, throws out and egests all, but more easily by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the finger in the throat: and by this means the ventricle being eas'd and evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, and freed from all that filthy matter that clog'd it, which being preserv'd in a Bason, till there be no further Spitting or Vomiting, you will finde that sometimes one, two or three pound of ugly matter, is gently drawne out without much straining, and that with immediate ease, and reliefe of the Patient: And when all trouble of Spuing or Spitting ceases, let him take <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

These humors for the most part work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the rest conveigh away themselves both upwards and downwards: Where, by the way, take these Cautions, that in Women or cachectick old Men, or any infected with the Pox, that you onely give it once, and in warme drinkes, as I said, and then stay till you see the effect of its working, after this it may be given againe, (unlesse the disease be overcome) lest the Humour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plentifull should ascend to the upper parts, and the Patient falling asleep might finde some vexation in his Jawes, occasioned by such putrid vapours, which yet with any abstergent Gargarisme, as of Wine, Bole Almoniack, Hony, or Allum, boyl'd ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with themselves, or with Betony, Mint<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Plantain,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>are washt away and Educt; In Melancholy diseases it draws away and cleanses all Humours like Pitch.</hi>

also be made use of in the cure of most of the maladies which I have mentioned, and in this particular you will acknowledge your selfe not to be a little obliged to me, after you have made experience. Now although by sublimation with severall kinde or Salts, I am changed into a poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, which most properly is called Subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate; or else by Abstraction, or re-infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of strong or separating waters, upon the same <hi>Mercury.</hi> I am transformed into a ruddy substance, impregnant b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

and Innocent Nature. But I hasten unto other things, what I have said re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates onely to me in the state of my Fluor and Crudity. But when Nature hath once advanc't me unto <hi>Semi-metalls,</hi> as <hi>Biso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muthum, Antimony, Zinkium,</hi> I am ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly commodious unto Man, and what is received from them, must be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged also from me, as being their Crearix and Mother.</p>
               <p>The excellency of <hi>Tutia</hi> lies in curing the Eyes, in Cankerous Ulcers, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Laten of Copper; the rest mingled ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with other things, or singly prepar'd, produce an infinite variety of Medicinall preparations, and those of as different formes and Colours, which since they are so innumerable, neither ought nor can be reckoned here; and for this reason also, impossible to put an estimate of the vast gaines that Artists make by them: How Many Artificers, Merchants, Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists and Physitians have huge incomes hereby, is above all account, and so I passe unto the second part of the progeny derived from me. To wit, <hi>Lead,</hi> adding onely this to what I have formerly said; that the use of Antimony is so great, both in Physick and Chymistry, that it is scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:51761:57"/>
to be demonstrated in a great volume, and therefore since others have written whole Tractates of the same subject, I shall rather acquiesce in them, than trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you with repetition, or hazard my elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence upon so Noble a Theame; and besides this, my time is very narrow. But Lead is of principall use in all Metall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, where Silver, Gold, Copper, and other mixtures, without the use of Lead could not be purified or separated. For melted Lead puts on the nature of <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> which gathers all fluxible matters un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it selfe, and among the rest Silver and Gold, from whence it is after separated by the Coppell, and drawes away the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Metalls that are nearer a kin to it, as Copper and others, the Gold or silver remaining untoucht upon the shell or Coppell of burnt Lead, is made Lythar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gury, which is most fortunately us'd in Plaisters and Oyntments. Nay, even Lead it selfe, either in powder, or the substance of a Leaden morter bruiz'd small, or else outwardly applyed in plates, which are found to doe a great deale of good in many diseases: In plates it is applyed to wrested Sinews, swolne Lipps, inflam'd Reines, and the like, in the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:51761:58"/>
substance bruiz'd, to Cancerous Ulcers, and all <hi>Fistulaes:</hi> Besides this, the uses of Lead are divers, Hence is coverings for Houses, Cisterns, Conduit-Pipes, and weights: Among the rest, what effect Leaden Bullets have in Warre, is a thing so known, that it needs not mentioning. But you will aske whether this be for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage or detriment? sleight, or strength? I stick not to confesse it to be an abuse, but yet such an one, as men cannot well want, both for defence and convenience, therefore that they are able to make War, &amp; destroy their Enemies, is all my gift, that is to say I my self changed into Lead. That severall Medicines are applyed, both inwardly, and outwardly, to severall diseases, otherwise incurable; as the French Pox, Pthyryasis, vermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation of Ulcers, inflammations of the Eyes and Reines, Cankers, Fistula's, and innumerable others, is meerly the libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of <hi>Mercury,</hi> and his children Tutie, Lythargury, Lead, and none other: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it a wonder that <hi>Mercury</hi> should be both Souldier and Physitian, since <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo</hi> himselfe ownes both qualities, and <hi>Pallas</hi> was ever equally addicted to Study and Warre; you know what the Poets
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:51761:58"/>
have told us, that the Caduceus of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi> was endowed with two severall Powers, that it could discharge the Souls of men out of their Bodies, and againe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them; send them to Hell, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward release them; which is most appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in this, I sometimes heale the diseases of Men, &amp; being transform'd by Arts into good Medicines, free from death: I am ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times poyson &amp; destruction unto him, as in the Wars or otherwise. But if any hurt arise from me, it must be imputed to the preposterous endeavours and designes of Men, which can turn the greatest Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials into the most violent Poysons. I come now to the third branch of my off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring, which is <hi>Tinne,</hi> this appears in more beauty and lustre than Lead, and therefore is imployed in more noble and splendid uses, of this are all kinde of Vessels, Dishes and Platters made, which Man makes use of, either in his Diet, or Physick. Many Nations eate and drinke out of it, and they hold it in great estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as very harmlesse, extreamely bright and handsome. But of all kindes the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> is clearly the best, as coming neerest Silver, and therefore it is most priz'd, it changes or infects nothing with its Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurous
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:51761:59"/>
fume and contagion, but faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preserves all that is shut up and trusted to it. Therefore as Lead covers the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side of houses, so Tinne adornes the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides &amp; the Kitchin. Of the one are grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Vessels or Instruments made, of the other the Lesser and Finer. So both of them, though of a weake and ductile bulke and substance, serve and attend the uses of Man, as much as possibly lyes in them.</p>
               <p>I shall say nothing of the profitable use of Tinne in Medicine, and in the colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of Potters, which is very conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. But to avoid prolixity, I shall step unto the next Branch, to wit, <hi>Copper,</hi> a substance of hotter Nature, and greater strength; of this there is much use in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall instruments necessary for Man, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially those that require Firmenesse, Capacity, and withall, Beauty; such are all those Brasse-pots, that must endure the hardship of the fire, Caldrons and Kettles, as bigge as Tonnes, which are us'd in the boyling of many things, (as Cloath, Beere, and many others) of which it is impossible to give an account: The Utensills of Housholdstuffe made either of Copper or Laten are so many, that
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:51761:59"/>
we shall passe them by, as being continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the eye, and generally knowne. Two things I must needs admire, and they are instruments made of Copper, which much exceed and excell all the rest, and these are <hi>Bells</hi> and <hi>Canons:</hi> By Bells we account the time of the day and night, and whether you will reckon at the rate of 12. hours, or 24. every houre is declar'd and proclaim'd so well, that we need not the voice of <hi>Stent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r</hi> or any other meanes to assemble the people, because the Bells doe this, both by their high ringing and sound, and by a noyse that the neerest approaches to Thunder.</p>
               <p>What profit ariseth from Clocks through the whole Christian world (for I speak not of the Turkish Barbarity, which is afraid least their Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny might be suppress'd by the people gather'd by this meanes) is indeed ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimable. We need not now a <hi>Cyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophalon</hi> as they did in <hi>Egypt,</hi> to calculate either by her pissing or shiting, to distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute the day and night into 12. equall spaces, when by the noyse of Bells all this is not onely heard and computed, but it is the same in night as in the day. 'Tis also needlesse that we should measure
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:51761:60"/>
time by an houre-glasse, or water-glasse, as the <hi>Romans</hi> did, because Bells give a writ of ease and silence to all these Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and they onely tell us the time of the day. Not to mention the crowing of Cocks, the measuring of shadowes, whilst the Sunne is in the Meridian, and the like observations of Day and Night, which it may be may serve, where Bells are not in use, otherwise not at all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, Bells call the people to Sermons, meetings, assemblies, funeralls, and what not. To Sermons, that every man by his devotion may approach to God and come neerer him; to Meetings, that they may either commonly joyne together, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst an Enemy or wilde Beasts, or Theeves, or Fire, or Water, or whatever prejudices else they are like to receive, without the remedy and assistance of common hands and common help. We declare Fire an Enemy by Bells, as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd, that Thunder is dispers'd by the commotion of the Aire (caus'd by Bells.) The office assign'd to Bells is express'd in great Letters in a Sapphick verse, and that in one of the greatest in all <hi>Germany,</hi> and (for ought I know) in the Christian world, as the inscription witnesses. For
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:51761:60"/>
it weighs two hundred seventy five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred weight, that is, 27500. pound weight.

               <p>
                  <hi>Mercury</hi> therefore that in the found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Bells, gives both sound and matter, doth all those duties, that is to say, calls people to their Devotions, and Summons them to whatever else they are to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, and therefore in this point, may very well claim the greatest part of the prerogative. The things that have been said before, may be accounted common &amp; easily imitated and supplyed by others, but these that I now insist on, must be solely attributed to <hi>Mercury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No Man can of Wood, Stones or Glass make a Bell, unlesse for deafe men or pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralyticks, which either cannot hear it, or stirre upon it. 'Tis <hi>Mercury,</hi> who though
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:51761:61"/>
he be mute, yet by the least impulse hath a voice; 'Tis he who makes others leap and gather together; 'Tis he that is the Sexton to the Church, and Clerk to the Market, a faithfull Scout, and Informer of all Dangers, that any may incurre or avoid them. 'Tis he that calls the hungry and the barking stomack to its diet, that awakes the sleepy and the sloathfull to industry, and gaining their bread. 'Tis he that commends dead men to buriall, and declares their last farewell to the world. But lest I may chime too long in this tune, I shall passe to Artillery; And here what shall I say, or what shall I not say? Shall I tell you of the profits accrew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Mankind? Shall I suggest it as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention sent up from the Devill into the Earth, or found out by the inquisition of Man? Whatsoever it is, if any evill hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen upon it, it must not be imputed to <hi>Mercury</hi> or the matter, but the way and invention or rather the mis-use. For in all these Treasons to Man, <hi>Mercury,</hi> is not in the least accessary, but still continues faithfull to himselfe, to hurt no body and profit all men. If it hurt, blame others, that either employ it to so dangerous uses, or have brought it into such a form,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:51761:61"/>
or made use of such meanes as they thinke may contribute to satisfie their owne wills and Lusts. Hence come so many Thunders and dreadfull noises, and great breaches in Walls, made onely by Canon; for if <hi>Mercury</hi> or Metallick sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance be founded in a long and a hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low fashion, clos'd in the britch, and open in the bore, it then becomes an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine of mischief, otherwise not. But let it be so, it is altogether innoxious unlesse that cursed Gunpouder be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in it, which being ramm'd in, and set on fire, see how by the violence of Man, breaking out of it, it does the highest mischiefe; yet not singly by it selfe, but by a Bullet made of Mettall or Stone, which may restraine the egression of the fire, and force it like Thunder to break out and destroy all that's neere it, and that to the greatest damage and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine.</p>
               <p>If Mettall therefore stay in its own first forme, it is harmelesse, nay suppose it be chang'd, it is the same; but if you bring the third and the fourth, that is to say Powder and Bullet, and put fire to it, then indeed it becomes mischievous; nay that all the harme is in powder onely,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:51761:62"/>
may appeare from hence, that being laid in mines, sprung under Castles or Towns, and blown up, it overthrowes all above it with incredible celerity, noise and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
               <p>This is the onely thing which the <hi>Monk</hi> found out, which hath dispatch'd away 10000. more lives, than all your other ancient Machines, whether Slings, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tapults, Onager's, Rammes, Bowes, Darts or Arrows, which were but boyish trifles in respect of the moderne Artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. What ever therefore hath been fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously done against the Enemies of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, is meerly perform'd by these Gunnes. 'Twas meerly done by the hand and mouth of <hi>Mercury.</hi> It was I that took into my mouth Iron and Leaden bullets, but I was heightned by Gunpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and that in such a degree, as I have laid many Enemies flat before me; the blast of my mouth is very pernicious, nay, it is Thunder. I break down Walls, Forts, Castles, Townes, and all fortresses what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever. There are severall sorts of Guns made of me, some of Laton and Copper, some of Lead, some of Iron<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> some where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are great and busky, some of them middle siz'd, some little, some long, some
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:51761:62"/>
thick, some short, and some thin, and from hence, according to their severall formes, they have arriv'd at severall names; as Cannons, Mortar-pieces, Drakes, Musquets, &amp;c. for they are too many to particularize. All these are ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the death of Man, but by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe of Man, not the will of <hi>Mercury,</hi> for it were better for me that things fitter for the health of Man were bray'd in morters, than that bullets of great weight should be shot through me, to the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Man. It were better for me that you made Engines and Pumps to quench Fires in great Cities, (if they would but make them of Mettall) than on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary employ me to bring fire and destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. But because Man hurry'd by his passions, rushes upon mutuall slaughters and Massacres, I whether I will or no, am forc'd to doe the office of a Hang-man; For them let them discharge their owne consciences if they can, I as their servant doe but my duty.</p>
               <p>My fifth child is, <hi>Iron,</hi> which as Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists call it <hi>Mars,</hi> so it yields all assistance to that God of Warre, that is by Swords, Fauchions, Tucks, Rapiers, Hatchets, Muskets, &amp;c. <hi>Iron</hi> though it may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:51761:63"/>
the basest of Mettalls, does the greatest services to Mankinde; Generalls and Warriers use it not onely for to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade others, but oppress'd men, and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple enforc'd to a necessary defence, make use of it themselves. The Robber will be arm'd, and the Travellor must, that Iron may meet Iron, and one strength may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse or overcome the other. This is that which Tyrants make use of against all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience and non-compliance.</p>
               <p>This is that which Kings and Princes employ against Enemies and Traytors, by this the Judges punish the offences of the bad, for the safety of the good. Of Iron you make Bolts, Chains, and Shac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles, and that for so many uses, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not count them. 'Tis Iron makes all Scales and Weights, and firmely and strongly joynes together, all Coaches, Ships and Houses. 'Tis Iron that makes the greatest and strongest Instruments for the life Man, without which he could not subsist any time. Of Iron is made Nayles, Hammers, Axes, and Anviles, and what not from the Instruments that are made of these instruments. Iron well purified is <hi>Steel,</hi> which rightly manag'd, is such, that it cuts and severs the hardest things,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:51761:63"/>
as Wood, Iron it selfe, Hornes, Stones, and whatever. Of Iron is made Saws, and the Locks of all Doores and Tre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>suries, what you will not trust to any body else, is intrusted to this onely. This keeps away Theeves and Filchers, this preserves things ready stolne and made a prey, nay, this is that which makes Fetters for Theeves. By Iron chaines the wayes are rendred safe, both against Force and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undation. By Iron, Bridges, Towers, nay Pyramids, are enabled to endure. What more necessary to a Man than a Knife? What fitter than a Needle to sow his cloaths together? What more convenient for Man, than Tongs, Fire-shovels and Grates; yet all this Iron does, and Iron does it by the meanes of <hi>Mercury.</hi> All these things therefore are made of coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated <hi>Mercury,</hi> and by it they are all strengthened. But withall there are made so many Medicines of it, that it may be rationally called in question, whether it have more or more royall uses in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick or in Policy. Nothing doubtlesse is more advantagious, than to give present reliefe to a sick body, and that to be taken inward, which is a cleare proofe that it is of an inoffensive nature. For Iron se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:51761:64"/>
times is taken in Electuaries, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves, Syrrups, Decoctions, and other wayes of prescript, and to that inwardly, not onely without any danger, but a great deale of benefit, though I must confesse if it be ill prepar'd, and if the managing of Man be ill, it gnaws, corrodes, and pierces through; but if it be made a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, it opens obstructions both of the Veins and Bowells, both by its penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and attenuating faculty. Hence it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten heales Cachexys and the Green sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and restores them to their former Vigour, Colour, and Beauty, so that they said not amiss, who said that <hi>Mars</hi> was the most welbeloved of <hi>Venus.</hi> But I am willing to wave any further speech of Iron, 'tis so much in sight and use, that any man may from hence draw other things, and from what I have said speak much more.</p>
               <p>I come now to my fairer progeny, and 'tis my sixth child, to wit, <hi>Silver,</hi> a Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall most precious and most valuable. What love, what admiration, what esteem all people put upon it, is not worth my businesse, since 'tis a thing so commonly knowne: With what labour, danger, care, it is drawne out of the deepest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:51761:64"/>
of the earth, nay in a manner the suburbs of Hell, they know that have been upon the places, of which I shall not trouble you in saying much, but this is the great Magnet of mankinde, that more allures and entices them and their understandings than the Loadstone does Iron. This is that <hi>Proteus</hi> that turnes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe into all shapes, and therefore is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the price and measure of all the rest. This is that <hi>Cornu-copia,</hi> whence fruits of all kindes all wealth plentifully proceeds. <hi>Money</hi> though it be dumb of of it selfe, speaks for all, and makes the speechlesse talkative; Though it be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable in its owne Nature, yet it gives motion to all things, animate or inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, and though it be dead in it selfe, and a thing not enjoying life, yet to Man <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>For the first, Kings, Princes, and other Magistrates reigne lawfully by it, not in order to Gaine, but in governing their People. For attribution, it gives many power who were unfit for it, it gives to Men, which the Law would not, it makes men reverenc'd, that were more worthy of hatred, it gives Wisdome to fools and Learning to the illiterate. 'Tis <hi>Mercury,</hi> who cloath'd in Silver, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent in his witness, splendour, and other properties commands all this. Grant me, there was never <hi>Mercury,</hi> and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence will be, there was neither Silver nor Gold, nor any other Mettall. <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> is an Hermaphrodite, he is Father and Mother to other Mettalls, though in making of imperfect Mettalls he admits an extraneous Sulphur different from his owne Nature. For what you say of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> in perfect Mettalls, is nothing else
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:51761:66"/>
but a maturer part of <hi>Mercury,</hi> and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter concocted, and it hath nothing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with the common sulphur, but the name. But I come to my seventh Sonne, which indeed is my first borne, because it is every way more perfect than the other. <hi>Gold</hi> is of the Masculine sex, <hi>Silver</hi> of the feminine. Now the right of primogeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture falls ever upon the Males, the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males by a <hi>Salick</hi> Law of nature being excluded. If you looke but on the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and the splendor of this my sonne Gold, you will find nothing to be more gallant, nothing more amiable if you consider his durability, and faithfull tena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, nothing so strong in fire, nothing lesse yeilding, of its price nothing worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or of greater value; if the weight, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, expansion, tenuity of substance, in all these, you will easily grant that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed all others. And if I should enlarge my selfe in his prayses as next unto man the epitome of the terrestriall world, none would be justly angry with me, but I must also be angry with him, for wanting com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sense. The Beauty of Gold is such that will not undeservedly say it is an ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type of the sunne it selfe, which is the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest and fairest of all creatures, and the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:51761:66"/>
most profitable to Mankinde. For with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him we should live in continuall dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, we should not discerne common businesses and affaires, nor distinguish one man from another. In like manner, unlesse Gold dissipated the clouds of humane things by its owne light, we should be absolutely confounded, and not able to make distinction of any thing. Hence hath the Altar of Gold so many unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously sacrificing to this Idoll, as faire and precious. For what is faire, is lovely, and on the contrary, as <hi>Theognis</hi> witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ss, for the Muses sung this Epitaphium at the Marriage of <hi>Cadmus,</hi>

Therefore no man seems to contemne it, but will value it at the highest rate; no mans humour can so much vilifie it, but he must be forc'd to obey it.

As the Poet sayes. And therefore out of excellent reason, Gold, which is in it self incorruptible, is on earth accounted the Symbol, the marke and the shadow of that eternity, which we shall enjoy above. For other bodies made of the foure Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are of a weak nature, and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible; this is that hundred handed Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, the Sonne of the Earth, who as often as he touches his Mother, recovers his lost strength, and gathers new; This is that

'Tis <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo</hi> the Archer, the destroyer of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases, the Souldier, the Knight of the Golden-Fleece, the Inventor of Physick, whom no Disease or Monster can resist, to whom nothing in the Earth is like or equall, excepting onely the Soule of Man: In Gold all things are most temperate, nay, contraries of the highest degree, so that Heat doth not prevaile over Cold, nor Drought over Moisture, but they are reciprocally restrain'd, and temper one another, and conforme themselves to an anatick equality, which is the greatest temper imaginable. What is said of that most temperate Region, which is beyond the tropick of <hi>Cancer,</hi> in the Westerne part of the World, where there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Frost, Heats, Raines, immoderate Droughts, nor any Disease to assault man, nor any infectious or venomous Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, by which meanes the Inhabitants live to a great age, as though they were seated in Paradice or the <hi>Elizian</hi> Fields, may be more truly said of the Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rure of Gold, which is impassible of any corruption or ill digestion.

Elements remaine unchang'd, firme, and lusty in their pristine vigour and temper, and in which no rottennesse or putrefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction can assault them. Whether one or the other may exceed in power, is a busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse that never comes into contest, none of them complaines that he is underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued. What they say of a certaine bone in the Thumbe of Man (the <hi>Hebrews</hi> call it <hi>Luz</hi>) some stick not to affirme that it can neither spoyle nor be consum'd, that it may remaine as a kinde of seed for the Resurrection, and the ground and materiall of the future superstructure; but if it be so, what affinity and hidden correspondence it holds with Gold that is incorruptible, it may appeare, since <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus Magnus</hi> hath recorded that Gold hath been found in Sculs of dead men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their <hi>Sutors</hi> and in their Teeth. Hence questionlesse men desire so much to finger Gold, as a hint and document of their Resurrection, &amp; the Eternity they shall enjoy after this life, and therefore they look after it, not only with greedy eyes, but possess'd mindes and utmost in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, desirous, if it were but digestible, to make it their food and repast, and by a pleasing artifice, to guild their owne

By this means the vertue of Gold begets affection, and its beauty continues it, for it is most dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>What vertue there is in Gold (besides its contempt of fire) is well enough un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood by Physicians, who give it to their Patients either in Leafe, Filings or powder, with Electuaries, Conserves, or Syrups, as a singular restorative of the heart, and in this they are not deceiv'd, for 'tis dictated by reason, and confirm'd by experience. For why should there not in that little Cittadell, which is so strongly fenc'd and fortifi'd, that scarce any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour of Man (unlesse very rare'y it meets successe) can finde entrance, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine within it, all the Magnalities and Mysteries of Nature? We see that our Creatour hath shrouded the Corne under Eares and Chaffe, hath given the Nut a Shell, the Chestnut a thick and rugged one, and hath fenc'd the Almond with a kinde of Stone, yet all these are most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for Man. He had in vaine there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:51761:69"/>

                  </gap> fine things, handsome and rare, passe ever at a great Rate. In Man, there is a most lively and true Image of all things spirituall and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreall, and Gold represents the same of Man. Gold cheers and refreshes his heart, which as it receives a generall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, infus'd by the heart of the World, the Sun, so it very gratefully repayes what is receiv'd from the celestiall Sunne to the heart of Man, who is the lesser world. Hence comes the generall consent of all Nations, in Gold as the measure of all things measurable, and the rate of all things marchantable, and these excellent qualities, all people, though they differ in Tongues, very well understand, as though they read it in an open book, which doubtlesse ought to give it prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence above any thing else. This golden Book study all Chymists, Physitians, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticians, all Men of Traffique and Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks, but I must impeach the first, as knowing but the first Letter of it, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond scarcely understand the next Letter, but few are able to dive into the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:51761:69"/>
of all five. Merchants and Usurers, that so much adore it and abound with it, stay onely as its surface, as boyes do if they finde any thing rare, or of an odde colour in Beanes. And this they know themselves, they know it is necessary for Traffick, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, or delight, but nothing else, and in this very little differ from Beasts, which very well know the use of Hay, but are abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely ignorant what it is, or from whence it comes.</p>

These two contributions which I have paid, both to Arts and Armes, are so great, that all others, though they be prepar'd of Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls, must needs yeild unto them. For the former, take two instructed in it, they will in one day dispose of more Letters, than two thousand others can write, which indeed is a matter worthy of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration and astonishment.

He is conceiv'd in clayish and dirty parts, I meane in a wombe stuffd with Fleagme and Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly; hence his spirit sends forth a very ill savour, especially if it be warm'd. No small share of this Empire would fall to him, if his foure other Brothers would as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, but they have greater Interest, yet notwithstanding he is the Tryer and Searcher of them all, because he approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches my nature neerest in softnesse, which

               <p>The Birth of my third Sonne promiseth more, for he appeares ruddy, and of a stronger constitution, and full of blood, and is very able to endure all the assaults of Summer weather, yet notwithstanding he brings from his wombe an adust Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy of a greenish red, and therefore is not fit to performe the most duties. He is vext commonly with the Scab like a Leaper, especially if any violent fire externally annoy him, for it puts him into extreame thirst, and inflames his Bowels. After these three, another must be my successor, who though he be elder than two of them, yet they much exceed him in finenesse, equality and temper. <hi>Jupiter</hi> is the most choice of all, of a most royall ingenuity and complexion, which wants nothing but a redder face, and an ability to endure the Sun. He may be heire to a great deale of wealth, if he made a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal agreement with some of his Brothers, so that from them both, there may arise an Hermaphroditick substance.
