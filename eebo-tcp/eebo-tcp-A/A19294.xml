         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>RIght worthy and beloued
in our Lord Iesus Christ:
It is the wonderfull mercy
and exceeding patience of
our gratious God towards vs of this
<hi>sinfull Nation</hi> that in the middest of
such fearfull stormes and bloody
garboyles deuouring our <hi>neighbors</hi>
round about vs, wee of this <hi>Iland</hi>
though, as it were, enuironed round
about with such tempestuous seas,
do yet notwithstanding enioy such
<pb facs="tcp:16843:3"/>
temperate seasons, as not onely to
eate the fruite of our owne labours,
but to be enabled moreouer out of
our aboundance to entertaine and
releeue our distressed neighbours.
And is not the <hi>wisedome of God</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
herein to <hi>warne</hi> vs to <hi>looke
home,</hi> when our <hi>neighbours house</hi> is
on fire, and to make it our owne
case, what is common to vs with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
Is not his mercy vnspeakeable
that seeing <hi>charitie couereth a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of sinnes,</hi> and <hi>much is forgiuen to
those that loue much,</hi> therefore wee
may haue hope of <hi>Gods</hi> longer for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance
&amp; indulgence towards vs,
so long as we regard the afflictions
of <hi>Ioseph,</hi> &amp; by our brotherly affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
<hi>beare one anothers burthen.</hi>
Surely though the <hi>sickle must be put
in when the haruest is ripe,</hi> and there
are too many signes among vs that
the <hi>regions are white vnto the haruest,</hi>
yea that the <hi>Deere</hi> is gone out to
go through the land, yet euen here
I haue obserued these meanes to stay
the <hi>execution.</hi> First, when there are
<pb facs="tcp:16843:3"/>
               <hi>some</hi> remaining to <hi>stand in the gap</hi> to
turne away the wrath. Secondly,
when the Lord is <hi>iustified</hi> and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued
by his word. And thirdly,
when by our <hi>compassion</hi> and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
wee doe communicate with
the afflictions of our <hi>brethren,</hi> and
so voluntarily suffer with them in
their distresses. Wherein as we haue
speciall cause to blesse our gratious
God for his good hand with our
worthy <hi>Nehemiah</hi> in this holy
worke, so are wee wisely to secure
our selues in succouring others, and
doing good while wee haue time
to the houshold of faith. Shall not
Sathan and his <hi>instruments</hi> herein
otherwise condemne vs, who if euer
heretore, do speedily combine them
selues against the Lord and his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted,
whose maine policy it is
in these latter dayes to <hi>disunite</hi> the
hearts of Christians and to weaken
their hands that they may more
speedily and easily make prey of
them. Doe not his <hi>croaking frogges</hi>
those infernall <hi>Iebusites</hi> compasse
<pb facs="tcp:16843:4"/>
land and sea to this end, creeping
into the chambers, yea into the harts
of <hi>Princes,</hi> both to exasperate such as
are auerse against the poore me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers
of Christ, and also alienate euen the
well affected from the maintenance
of the <hi>common faith.</hi> And doe wee
thinke that they haue left any stone
vnrowled to compasse the same,
can we imagine but that these <hi>spirits
of diuels</hi> haue waded into the depth
of their <hi>fathers</hi> methods, and as she
in the Poet:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When heauen will affoord no helpe,
shee'le moue the infernall powers,</hi> so in
despite of heauen these <hi>limbs of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi>
haue now failed to employ the
powers of darkenesse for the more
effectuall deluding of the children
of disobedience? And are not these
the <hi>times</hi> wherein if it were possible
the <hi>very elect</hi> may bee <hi>seduced</hi> and
ensnared hereby. Is not the <hi>wisdome</hi>
and <hi>iustice of God</hi> admirable herein
that when the <hi>Foole saith in his heart
there is no God,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Atheist</hi> dreams
of no other hell but to bee in <hi>debt,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:16843:4"/>
and affliction, and so plots by all
meanes to build his heauen on earth
by wallowing in all excesse of riot
and vanitie, as hereby he reapes <hi>such
wages of his error as is meet,</hi> euen to
be giuen vp to a <hi>reprobate sense,</hi> and
so not onely to all monstrous and
desperate wickednesse, but euen to
maintaine and secure the same a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all future reckonings, as if he
had <hi>made a couenent with hell, and
were at an agreement with death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> so
is he iustly taken in his owne <hi>crafti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi>
and most wonderfully arrested
by the power of <hi>hell,</hi> to the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
confusion of his imagined hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse,
and while hee dreames of
no other heauen but <hi>to doe what hee
list in earth,</hi> hee is not onely therein
<hi>restrained</hi> by the power of heauen
to the confusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his present hopes
for the good of the Saints, but also
iustly caught in the snares of his
owne wickednesse by the <hi>power of
hell,</hi> as to beginne and seale hereby
vnto him <hi>eternall vengeance,</hi> and to
hasten him thereto; so that the <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:16843:5"/>
may more wonderfully <hi>escape
of our trouble,</hi> when the <hi>wicked are
falne into the pit they digged for them.</hi>
Surely as it is a righteous thing with
<hi>God,</hi> that <hi>they that doe not receiue the
loue of the truth, shall be giuen vp to
strong delusions to beleeue lies:</hi> so if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<hi>satan were transformed into an
Angell of light,</hi> and so more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
by his <hi>lies</hi> and subtilties did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
vnstable soules: If euer the
<hi>sure word</hi> and <hi>wonderfull workes of
God</hi> were outfaced and suppressed
by the sleights and forgeries of the
<hi>God of this world,</hi> the experience here
of is most notorious in our times: to
instance in this <hi>particular</hi> being the
subiect of our experience how
mightily the <hi>Lord</hi> hath iustified his
<hi>word,</hi> both auouching in these dayes
the <hi>truth of this doctrine of Witchcraft</hi>
as also euidencing the <hi>power</hi> thereof
in <hi>dissoluing the workes of Satan,</hi> as
experience hath made it manifest,
so we haue had not onely the <hi>great
Patrones</hi> and <hi>friends</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi>
confirming the same, but euen the
<pb facs="tcp:16843:5"/>
               <hi>Churches verie enemies</hi> haue beene
enforced to acknowledge no lesse.
And yet such hath been the <hi>efficacy
of delusion,</hi> that this very same <hi>most
glorious truth</hi> vpon other respects as
it hath found hard measure among
fained <hi>friends,</hi> so it hath also there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
beene <hi>traduced</hi> and <hi>peruerted</hi> by
it <hi>enemies.</hi> And surely we may the
lesse wonder hereat, if we consider
wisely, that as <hi>commodities</hi> are in <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest</hi>
with many according to their
<hi>diuers humours,</hi> and <hi>different</hi> seasons,
so doth it befall the <hi>sacred truth.</hi>
which though it be sometimes in <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,</hi>
when it may serue to <hi>aduance
the pride of the flesh and infancie of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
yet doth it easily <hi>grow out of
date,</hi> when either it tends to <hi>humble
the flesh,</hi> or iustly <hi>challengeth luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warmnesse
and hypocrisie.</hi> Which as it
was the portion of the <hi>Lord and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of the Church,</hi> sometimes to bee
<hi>cryed vp with Hosanna,</hi> eftsoones
to bee <hi>cryed downe with crucifige</hi> so
hath it beene the lot of the <hi>scepter of
this kingdome, the budding rod of Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:16843:6"/>
sometimes to be <hi>turned into a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent</hi>
in the opinion of man, as if it
onely entended to destruction and
not to edification, no better then a
<hi>doctrine of licentiousnesse</hi> or <hi>sedition</hi>
and <hi>despaire,</hi> which eftoones was
in esteeme as <hi>Angels foode,</hi> sweeter
then <hi>honey,</hi> pretious aboue <hi>rubies,</hi>
most orient <hi>gems.</hi> Which seeing it
hath beene also the <hi>portion</hi> of this
<hi>truth</hi> concerning <hi>witchcraft,</hi> is it
any maruell if what man opposeth
and seeketh to suppresse, the <hi>Lord
himselfe</hi> hath powerfully maintaind
and iustified, as prouing vnto it
<hi>gainesayers a sauour of death,</hi> that
haue refused to embrace the same
as a sauour of life vnto life. Surely
when I discerne the efficacy of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion
preuailing in these dayes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
vpon such that haue <hi>tested</hi> of
the <hi>good word of God,</hi> and beene <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takens</hi>
of the <hi>enlightning spirit:</hi> and so
haue had some <hi>kenning of the power
of the life to come,</hi> and yet are so
<hi>falue away</hi> from <hi>conscience,</hi> yea from
<hi>science</hi> it selfe, that they are very
<pb facs="tcp:16843:6"/>
               <hi>strangers from the life of God through</hi>
their <hi>affected ignorance,</hi> and being
<hi>willingly ignorant</hi> of what they haue
formerly beene conuinced of, are
growne to bee <hi>starke-mockers</hi> of all
powers; yet all forme of Religion,
and so in this their Atheisme,
sing a Requiem to their soules, <hi>fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi>
no other <hi>hell,</hi> then to be <hi>mooued
in their slippery state,</hi> and <hi>dreaming</hi> of
no <hi>other heauen</hi> then to <hi>build their
foundation in the sands:</hi> Mee thinkes
I see the <hi>foolish worldling</hi> on the
pinnacle of his confidence, and so in
his <hi>greatest security,</hi> lying open to
confusion. And do I not see the <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice

herein, in besotting the foole in his

vp to rest vpon such broken reedes,
for the securing of his Babel, which
are the onely meanes to confound
the same. And hath not the <hi>God of

                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> That we should in thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse,
<hi>acknowledge his great power
and mercy,</hi> That hath so honoured
and iustified the Reuelation of the

which this <hi>Mysterie of Satan</hi> which
in former ages hath beene either
smothered, or peruerted, to the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
erecting and maintaining of
the Kingdome of darknesse; is now
gratiously and cleerely, not onely
discouered, but further also reformed
to the true vse thereof, and so wee
rightly enformed how to deale
therein: And so by the power of
God, the <hi>Magistrate</hi> enabled to take

                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> seeing the Power of the
Gospell is thus able to discouer and
confound the kingdom of Satan, may
not this <hi>condemne our vnprofitable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing

                     <p>Surely seeing <hi>God is glorifyed in

And doth not Satan most cunningly

                     <p>For whereas flesh and bloud

(in the second Place) Satan offers
himselfe vnto this Nouice, as a <hi>Slaue

by him, whom he now labours to
enthrall for euer, And therein nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
gulling the ambitious spirit with

                     <p>Thus are <hi>Yong Schollers</hi> puffed vp

And yet doe wee runne to those

                     <p>And doth not their example <hi>har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den

                     <p>2 By the <hi>Lawes of each nation,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
this Mysterie.</p>
                     <p>3 By the generall experience of
all Ages wherein eyther through ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
this wickednesse hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:16843:31"/>
or else, for abuse of knowledge,
euen hypocrites haue beene giuen

because they detaine the truth
of God in vnrighteousnesse, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
to their Art, yea to Sathan
himselfe, euen wherein they pretend
to serue God, as appeareth afterward
in the vse heereof.</p>
                     <p>This also is manifest by <hi>sound Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
and <hi>Induction.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And that from the <hi>Power, Wisedome</hi>
and <hi>Iustice</hi> of God.</p>
                     <p>Gods <hi>Power</hi> is manifest; as his yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
vp the mightiest to the power of
Sathan, as Gods executioner, so in
brideling Satan to hurt &amp; cut where
it pleaseth him, <hi>Iob</hi> 1 &amp; 2. 2. <hi>Corin.</hi> 4.
<hi>Matth.</hi> 8.</p>
                     <p>His <hi>Wisedome</hi> admirable in this:
That giuing the wicked their desire
for the satisfying of the flesh.<note place="margin">Ps. 106. 25.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>1 They are willingly giuen vp to
submit their soules to the power of
Satan, and so to be the executioners
of their owne damnation.</p>
                     <p>2 And whereas Satan, if he should
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:16843:32"/>
appeare <hi>in his owne likenes,</hi> would not
so easily be intertained, could not do
so conueniently the will of God, in
deceiuing the wicked: yet beeing
now disposed by the Lord of glory
in this wise and glorious manner,
that by the ministerie of men &amp; wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
subiect to our infirmities: and
therefore more likelie by reason of
natures bonds, to preuaile with their
like, Satan shal tender his seruice vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs; doth hee not conuey his poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
into our soules more easily? doth
hee not preuaile more effectually to
our ensnaring and destruction?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Iustice of God</hi> shineth also
most gloriously in this mysterie of
Witchcraft.</p>
                     <p>As first, <hi>In making it a Punishment
to such as will not obey the truth,</hi> that
they might be deluded and ensnared
thereby.</p>
                     <p>And so in sealing vp, in this strange
&amp; terrible affliction by Witchcraft,
&amp; the <hi>desperate couenant</hi> that is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;
euen eternall vengeance, and
those <hi>intolerable paines</hi> of the damned,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:16843:32"/>
that the <hi>Atheist</hi> may be vtterly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded,
and the desperate sinner,
may be vtterly without excuse: As
preaching to the rebellious world,
by these prophets of Satan the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie
of their damnation, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
to embrace the glad tydings of
their saluation from the Messengers
of the Lord.</p>
                     <p>And is not the Iustice of God ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
heerein, that the wicked are
now the choosers and executioners
of their owne damnation, in beeing
willingly ignorant of the trueth: In
their best wisedome heaping vp tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
according to their owne lusts,
purposely submitting themselues to
these prophets of the diuell, that so
they may be turned to their ineuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
condemnation?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It is manifest from the
<hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Cunning of Satan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Who although hee naturally hate
God, yet in the Pride of his heart he
seekes to imitate him in all his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that so he may more desperately
execute his malice both against God
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:16843:33"/>
in disgracing his prouidence, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
man in furthering his destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
And therefore, as God <hi>hath
his couenant</hi> with man: so will Satan
haue a <hi>speciall couenant</hi> also with his
seruants.</p>
                     <p>As the Lord hath his <hi>Ministers</hi> to
execute his wrath vpon the disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient:
namely, <hi>the Magistrate,</hi> so Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than
will haue his <hi>badde Witches</hi> to
execute against the sonnes of men.
Yea,</p>
                     <p>As the Lord hath his <hi>Prophets</hi> and
<hi>faithfull ministers</hi> to relieue and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
his distressed people: so Sathan
will haue his <hi>good Witches,</hi> to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
helpe to such as seeke vnto him,
&amp;c.</p>
                     <p>And as the wise and mercifull
God, because wee are not able to
heare him, if he should himself speak
vnto vs, doeth therefore conuey his
will into <hi>earthen vessells 2. Corinthians</hi>
4. 7. causing men, like our selues, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
to the same infirmities with vs,
to deliuer his councell, and prepare
vs to the obedience thereof: euen so
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:16843:33"/>
dealeth <hi>Sathan the god of this world,</hi>
with the children of disobedience.
That whereas by reason of Natures
guilt and infirmitie, they could not
endure his terrible and personall
presence: therefore hee tendereth
his will vnto them, by certaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull
and <hi>Familiar charmes,</hi> yea
by <hi>Witches his vassales</hi> insinuateth
himselfe into vs, colouring his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
and sleights by some shew of
outward holinesse, as by <hi>abusing of
holie Names, Prayers, Reliques, &amp;c.</hi>
that so hee may the better winne
from vs an approbation of his help;
and so the more dangerously ensnare
vs in his cruell pawes.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly also this is manifest from
the consideration of <hi>our owne cursed
nature.</hi> And that not onely because
wee are <hi>Sathans slaues</hi> naturally,
and so are led captiue at his will, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to further our owne condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and the condemnation of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:</p>
                     <p>But especially in regard of those
<hi>Remaynders of originall goodnesse:</hi>
                        <pb n="32" facs="tcp:16843:34"/>
As some naturall light, some consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of good and euill, &amp;c. whereby
wee being vsually puffed vp, and so
laboring to encrease these gifts: see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
wee know not the right meanes
heereunto, namely, to <hi>seeke them of
the Lord:</hi> Is it any maruell, if we fall
to chaffer with Satan for the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereof? especially seeing hee
will not faile <hi>to offer his helpe,</hi> and that
vpon very faire and seemingly equal
termes?</p>
                     <p>Now if wee consider on the other
side, that <hi>corruption wherewith</hi> we are
infected euen from the mothers
wombe. <hi>Two things</hi> there are here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
that further this compact with
Satan.</p>
                     <p>The one is, <hi>The earnest and vnsati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
desire to accomplish our lusts:</hi> which
seeing we cannot compasse <hi>by lawfull
meanes,</hi> will we sticke at any thing,
though it be the hazard of the soule,
to attaine our desires? <hi>Math.</hi> 16. 25.
Especially, seeing as wee desire to
commit sinne with greedinesse, so
either <hi>for credite,</hi> wee would not be
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:16843:34"/>
seene therein: and indeed it is Satans
policy to blind the eies of our minds,
that so walking in darkenes, we may
not know whither we go, but euen
like fooles be led to the Stockes, and
oxen to the shambles: And hath not
this <hi>Practise of Witch-craft</hi> many cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
sleights, and colours to hide
and cloke sin, to illude and peruert
our iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, that we may not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
whereabout we are? Consider to
this end that which follows: &amp; God
giue vs vnderstanding in all things.</p>
                     <p>Adde we hereunto, That as sin en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth

so <hi>naturall light by degrees is cleane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted</hi>
and extinguished. And the
bands of common honestie beeing
wholy cast off and violated, the bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
is giuen to all desperate and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous
sins: and that the wicked
may more securely reuell therein: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
is made a scorne of,<note place="margin">Psal. 10. 5.</note> and <hi>God is
forgotten,<note place="margin">Iob 21. 15.</note> and the knowledge of his wayes
vtterly reiected:</hi> whereby the Lord in
iustice is prouoked to execute his
fierce wrath, and to powre out the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:16843:35"/>
most <hi>bitter viall</hi> thereof vpon the
soules of the wicked, yeelding them
vp wholly to the power of Sathan:
whereby they are left to these despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
extremities, as to make <hi>reall co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenants
with him:</hi> to yeelde him vp
their soules, and all at his deuotion;
to consecrate themselues to his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
and homage, and so to become
<hi>spectacles</hi> heerein of the <hi>certainetie of
damnation,</hi> for the confusion of the
<hi>Atheist,</hi> that thinkes there is no hell,
and the warning of the <hi>Christian,</hi> to
auoyd the danger thereof.</p>
                     <p>3 And seeing it is the Iustice of
Almightie God to <hi>punish extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
and monstrous sinnes,</hi> with <hi>strange
and vnwonted plagues.</hi> Therefore see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the wicked ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not content them
selues with common and naturall
sins,<note place="margin">Note.</note> but must further deuise sins a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

hereto by the diuine Iustice, puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
their <hi>carnall Wisedome:</hi> in their

vnnaturall Impieties:</hi> Is it not yet
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:16843:35"/>
further iust with the Lord, to leaue
them to be tormented by Satan, the
god of this world, whom they haue
consecrated themselues vnto, and
that with <hi>strange</hi> and <hi>fearefull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uulsions,</hi>
and horrible tortures, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
to rend the bodie from the soule,
but that the mightie hand of GOD
ouer-ruleth Sathan, and sustaineth
Nature, to the further aduancing of
his diuine Iustice and admirable po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer.
And yet all this in shew by the
<hi>ministerie of a poore, weake,</hi> and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
woman,<note place="margin">Note.</note> to the increase of their
rage, and confusion of carnall wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,

proceedeth from Satans po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
permitted iustly by the Lord,
to preuaile thus with his dearest ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants,
to deceiue and ensnare vnsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

                     <p>And therefore, howsoeuer Satan
could <hi>without the ministerie of Witches,</hi>
do happily as great hurt to the <hi>bodie,</hi>
and therefore it may seeme, that to

is the soule that he principally hunts
after; &amp; so, by hurting the body, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:16843:37"/>
also the further ensnaring
thereof. Hence is it, that he employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
these instruments, to accomplish
his will by, not onely ensnaring their
soules, by satisfying their desires to
hurt, and helpe whom they list: But
hereby also endangering the soules

buy this helpe with the hazard of

                     <p>And so also enthralling their soules
yet more fearefully vnto Sathan: In
that receiuing help from such means

heereby it comes to passe that Satan
is adored, and aduaunced aboue all
that is called God. The <hi>holie and

that the <hi>bad Witches power</hi> being so

seeme to imply a <hi>unllotie in this Trade;</hi>
or at least challenge the power and

of the bad Witches power,
tendeth much to <hi>aduance the Mysterie
of this iniquitie;</hi> as hereafter is made
manifest, and so to make good the

seeing this both for the present
proues <hi>a great confusion to the Witches

from the Blesser, who in this
case is sought to for helpe; and so
detecting the bad Witch makes
way for her riddance that her Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
Satan may haue more worke.</p>
                     <p>And howsoeuer when the <hi>Witch

                        <note place="margin">Why though the Witch bee punished, yet the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction is not remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</note> 
                        <hi>the partie afflicted hath no
ease,</hi> yet this doth not argue that
his affliction came not by that
meanes. But herein appeareth; first,
the absolute power of God, who
ties not the outward blessing simply
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:16843:39"/>
to the vse of holy meanes: Though
the Magistrate haue done his duetie
in punishing the Witch, yet the
party afflicted must still abide Gods
leasure, The Lord is not simply
subiect to man: Or else though that
outward meanes may bee vsed for
the punishment of the offender, yet
seeing the affliction must bee san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
before it shall bee remoued
from the Saints. And this procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
hitherto may happily bee a
meanes for the good of the Witch,
as being staid from further hurting,
and so happily as shee belongs
to the Lord, by this temporall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
may bee brought to true
repentance: But it cannot simply
and necessarily auaile the party af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted;
therefore it is the great wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and bountie of the Lord,
not to cease the affliction vpon the
punishment of the Witch, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to linger it vpon his Saints, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
by more <hi>effectuall meanes of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi>
and <hi>vnfained repentance,</hi> they
shall make an holy vse of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:16843:39"/>
chasticement, And so in it due
season it shall bee remoued from
them.</p>
                     <p>And may not the wise and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
GOD heerby meete with
our <hi>Confidence in the meanes;</hi> not
remouing the correction, though
wee haue done the will of God
for the further <hi>Triall of our faith,</hi>
and aduancement of his <hi>absolute

                     <p>And so thereby not onely <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding

this grieuous affliction</hi> to his Saints,
though hee do not vtterly remoue it;
but further also in deliuering them
by this affliction from this miserable
world; or at least leading them by
the continuance of the rod, to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:16843:40"/>
sound repentance, that so they may
howsoeuer be bettered by it.</p>
                     <p>And therefore seeing the Lord
can raise <hi>light of darkenesse,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Saints subiect to this cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, and why.</note> and these

                     <p>And what though the Word

                     <p>For seeing Satan is a <hi>Lyer from the

to lie <hi>vnwittingly,</hi> in confessing

did of himselfe, that so hee
<hi>may hasten them to their deserued con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,</hi>
causing their own tongues
iustly to fall vpon them, both in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
their will though they did
no hurt in this particular, and mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
with <hi>former hidden wickednesse</hi>
by this supposed &amp; arrogated crime.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="46" facs="tcp:16843:41"/>But heere <hi>it is replyed,</hi> that these

prayers</hi> to the accomplishment of
their cures,<note place="margin">Witches though they vse salues and prayers yet be conui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerie.</note> and therefore neither
is it likely that Satan would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyne
with such holy meanes, and
indeed it is needlesse, if these will
doe it, to admit of Satans assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
thereto.</p>
                     <p>To which wee answere, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are such <hi>medicines</hi> as are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
vsually fit for all such cures,
because commonly they giue but
<hi>one Salue</hi> for all diseases: Or if
they were, why may not Satan vse
these to cloke and colour his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence?</p>
                     <p>As for <hi>prayers,</hi> neither are they
<hi>auaileable</hi> in regard of the <hi>person,</hi>
being vsually prophane, popish, or

to such ends; but where other

And may not Satan hide heereby

                     <p>And therefore seeing <hi>Christ as
man onely,</hi> could not work these mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
It followeth that whatsoeuer
are wrought by men are deceitfull
and counterfait, And being won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
and strange effects are therefore
effected by the subtiltie of Satan, as
<hi>being able to doe strange things</hi> aboue
the ordinarie course of nature,
though not simply contrarie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
which ordinarily the wit of
man cannot possibly produce: And
that</p>
                     <p>1 Because he being a <hi>spirit,</hi> is of
<hi>extraordinarie knowledge</hi> and <hi>capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi>
to search into the secrets of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and there to frame strange and
wonderfull things: And that the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
because</p>
                     <p>2 He is <hi>ancient and full of experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
and so hath encreased his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and profited his practise,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:16843:44"/>
which man by reason of his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and forgetfulnesse, want of
opportunitie cannot possibly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe:
And this</p>
                     <p>3 The rather because Satan to
his knowledge and experience hath
<hi>great power</hi> sufficient euen to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
all inferiour creatures if the
Lord did not restraine: And withall</p>
                     <p>4 Is <hi>exceeding nimble</hi> and readie
in exequution, being able to conuey
himselfe and other creatures in a
trice euen from farre distant pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
                     <p>1 And so by vertue of skill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
able to apply <hi>Creature to creature</hi>
and the <hi>efficient causes to the matter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2 And that speedily aboue the
ordinary course of nature how can
he but effect admirable things:</p>
                     <p>3 Especially if we consider that
the Lord permitting, it is possible
for Satan to conuey <hi>himselfe into the
substance of the creature,</hi> without any
penetration of dimensions, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the creature although it bee

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:16843:45"/>
not onely according to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of the nature thereof, but as
farre as the strength and abilitie of
those principles will possibly reach
and extend themselues.</p>
                     <p>By this it is manifest, that <hi>Satan
can worke wonders,</hi> and these accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

                     <p>And yet he cannot <hi>Change one

3 <hi>reuenge, 4 couetousnesse, &amp;c.</hi>
which being ioyned with a 1 <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of Gods ordinance, 2 grosse and
open prophanenesse,</hi> and 3 <hi>to desperate

occasion to conceiue, that God hath
forsaken vs: and so now is his time
to chalenge his owne, or at least to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:16843:47"/>
set vpon vs, to make vs his owne.</p>
                     <p>To this purpose first doth he suite
himselfe according to our <hi>seuerall

and so preuenting meanes of

THis is according both to the

workes.</p>
                     <p>You haue heard how Sathan dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth,
to prepare the wicked to this
Art: Now let vs consider the <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>
how he sets vpon them, to <hi>enter</hi>

                     <p>1 To the <hi>Times,</hi> which if they be
of <hi>Ignorance,</hi> then he appeares more
grossely in some <hi>Carnall and vgly

require of them.</p>
                     <p>4 And contenting himselfe with
some <hi>generall answer</hi> for them tending
to this effect, that they seeme con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented,
desiring nothing more then
to know what particular meanes it
may be, that so they may be masters
of their desires; and so</p>
                     <p>To this end concluding of a <hi>second

                     <p>It is not long but he keepes touch
with them, remembring them of
their greeuances, reuiuing their
hopes for helpe, kindling their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
to seek it from him: and so gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing
to some particular terms, what
they must doe in requitall againe;
Namely,</p>
                     <p>1 To <hi>addict themselues vnto his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice:</hi>
                        <pb n="61" facs="tcp:16843:48"/>
and when hee hath gotten this
promise of them.</p>
                     <p>2 Then <hi>he discouers vnto them what
hee is:</hi> making it apparant by some
more <hi>terrible forme,</hi> and thereby the
rather to awe them with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of his power:</p>
                     <p>And so to keepe them by terrour
<hi>from starting backe,</hi> and yet to giue
them hope by this resemblance of
his power, that he is able to do for
them, what they may desire, able to
confound their enemies, and defend
their friends.</p>
                     <p>And so happily for that time also
hee doth proceede no further with
them.</p>
                     <p>It is not long but he meetes with
them againe, and then proceedeth
to <hi>binde</hi> them to his allegeance, by
<hi>entring into a solemne league,</hi> and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant
with them.</p>
                     <p>But before we do come to speake

                        <p>THese are of <hi>two sorts:</hi> The first
<hi>expressed and man fist,</hi> because it
is performed by <hi>solemne words;</hi> Satan
appearing in some <hi>visible forme,</hi> and
the Witch answering <hi>really</hi> by some

To <hi>admit of the Diuell as her soueraigne

and all, to yeeld him all seruice both
of body and soule, while shee liues;
and so to leaue him bodie and soule
to dispose of at his pleasure after
death.</p>
                        <p>1 The <hi>occasion</hi> of this <hi>reall Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi>
is eyther the <hi>vnsatiablenesse of
mans desires,</hi> which to enioy he ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
not what he parts with, and so
expressing those desires by some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate
and violent passion, giues
occasion hereby to Sathan to tender
this seruice.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="69" facs="tcp:16843:52"/>
2 Or else some <hi>extreamitie of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>

will satisfie the Diuells request. And

this fearefull issue, as to engage his

                        <p>Another sort of <hi>Couenant</hi> there is,
<hi>secret,</hi> and <hi>mentall,</hi> as wee say, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by <hi>consequence,</hi> and <hi>necessarie

                        </p>
                        <p>And this vsually serues the turne,<note place="margin">Note.</note>
because Satan hereby deceiues most
dangerously: as deluding the Witch
that <hi>she is free,</hi> because she hath made
no <hi>verball composition,</hi> when as indeed
by those meanes, she is bound more
fearefully.</p>
                        <p>Or else, this prooues in some ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:16843:53"/>
a <hi>preparatiue</hi> to the other; especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
when the parties vse such means
ignorantly, which are no better then
Sathans indirect and abhominable
pranckes to procure ease against in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities.
As, to <hi>scratch the Witch,</hi> to
<hi>bang Amulets about their necke, &amp;c.</hi>
which though some doe ignorantly,
as thinking some inherent power to
be in those meanes to cure diseases:
yet doth this by degrees draw them
from the vse of law full means, cause
them to rest in those that are vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full:
and so nourishing them in infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie,
prouoke them in time to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
God; and so they are iustly left
to the power of Sathan, by him to
be ripened to the day of vengeance.</p>
                        <p>If wee would know the <hi>Tokens</hi> of
this secret Couenant.<note place="margin">Markes of the secret couenant.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>They are, <hi>First prayer for vnlawfull
things:</hi> which howsoeuer it may
seeme to be made to GOD, yet in
truth it is offered vp to Sathan: so
that if now by such meanes wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
maisters of our desires, this is a
pledge of this secret Couenant.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="71" facs="tcp:16843:53"/>
Secondly, <hi>vsing vnlawfull meanes:</hi>
such as are offered by Satan for helpe
in extremitie, as to <hi>goe to Blessers,</hi> to
<hi>scratch,</hi> to vse <hi>spells,</hi> &amp;c. wherein if
wee be <hi>conuinced with the truth,</hi> that
these haue no proper vertue to doe
such things, and yet shall vse them;
This is an other dangerous bond of
this secret Couenant.</p>
                        <p>So that though all that vse these
things are not brought to this Trade
of Witch-craft, to <hi>hurt the bodies of
others:</hi> yet are they <hi>hereby bewitched
in their soules,</hi> and so proue spirituall
deceiuers, to enthrall the souls of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to perpetuall perdition.</p>
                        <p>A third marke of this secret Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant,
is an ordinarie taking of
Gods name in vaine; especially in
blessing of Cattell, which although
the ignorant and vnbelieuing world
hath taken vp of custome,<note place="margin">And blind charitie.</note> yet the
first tutors hereunto haue beene the
Witches, thereby to colour their
sorceries, and draw more Proselites
to their deuotion.</p>
                        <p>And therefore it were to bee wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:16843:54"/>
that we were more exceeding
carefull in the sober and reuerent
vse of the name of God; especially,
when wee thinke or speake of these
outward things, lest Custome breed
profanenesse, and profanenesse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
and despight of GOD and
godlinesse. And so, although at the
first Sathan enter not into vs, yet by
degrees at the length he may so farre
preuayle, as first to draw vs to make
charmes of these holy names; and
so secondly vpon the effect answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
our Infidelitie, wee be further
drawne to vnlawfull desires, and to
be contented to submit to Satan for
the obtaining thereof, and so at the
length become practitioners in this
Art.</p>
                        <p>Vses of these Diuers Couenants.</p>
                        <p>By this it is apparent, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the caueats of Atheists
and profane persons against the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Witch-craft: That certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
there are Witches, as appeareth
by this Couenant betweene them
and Sathan.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="73" facs="tcp:16843:54"/>
And seeing insatiable desires are
an especiall cause of the making this
League with Sathan: Therefore we
are taught secondly,</p>
                        <p>1 To set bounds to our vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
desires; 2 to be content with
our estates; 3 to prepare our soules
to afflictions; 4 to enlarge our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
for heauenly things; 5 to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
our vnruly affections of euery
anger, and especially 6 to cast our
care vpon God in Iesus Christ, and
7 to haue our persons accepted of
God in him: that so we may not be
ensnared with Sathans baites.</p>
                        <p>And seeing the wicked are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed
to make open profession of
their homage and allegeanee vnto
the Diuell: and therefore much lesse
ought wee to be abashed to professe
our Faith in God, to giue a reason
of our hope and confidence in him:
If Satan will haue reall promises and
verball contracts, not contenting
himselfe only with the heart and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
man: Then surely ought not
we to content our selues with good
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:16843:55"/>
or bare purposes, but wee must la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to confesse with the mouth to
saluation, as wee beleeue with the
heart to righteousnes, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 10.
If Sathan will haue deedes as well as
words, then let vs also not be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
ouely, but also doers of the will
of God, lest wee deceiue our selues.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, seeing Sathan is growne
so cunning, as to content himselfe
with priuy signes and circumstances,
not exacting of all sortes publique
and expresse bargaines: shall not this
teach vs, not to content our selues
with bodilie seruice, and outward
deuotion: But especially, to labour
for trueth in the inward man? Shall
not this winne vs to watch seriously
ouer our thoughts and secret purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses?
Shall it not send vs vnto Christ,
for the daily purifying of our hearts
by faith in his precious bloud? shall
Shall it not still round vs in the eare,
to take heede of hypocrisie? lest this
be of al other the most sure bargaine
with the Diuell, seeing of all other,
the hypocrite is first to goe to hell, as
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:16843:55"/>
making a mocke of heauen. They
shall haue their portion with hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites:
of all other the hypocrite
shall drinke deepest of the cuppe of
vengeance.</p>
                        <p>Hitherto of the nature and kindes
of the <hi>Couenant:</hi> Now let vs

thereof.</p>

                        <p>The <hi>ground of this Couenant,</hi> is in i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation
of the Diuine Wisedome,

of the Lord our God, by the

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:16843:56"/>
to withdraw man from God, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrall
man more desperately to his

                        <p>And yet heerein <hi>to deceiue wretched

of that diuine breeding in the minds

                        <p>The Policies of Sathan in this Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
is manifold.</p>
                        <p>1 As first, to make them beleeue

<hi>the rather,</hi> when his performance is

                        <p>2 To <hi>binde them more surely to his

are to keepe touch with him, seeing

heerein by that bond of ciuill hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:16843:56"/>
which Nature so much standeth
vpon,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and resteth in, thereby, though
<hi>confounding,</hi> yet also flattering the

                        <p>But hath not Sathan (I pray you)
in this Couenant with the Witch, a
further reach, <hi>to deceiue others also?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Yea surely, and <hi>that many wayes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As <hi>first,</hi> heereby hee would beare
the world in hand, that he is now so
at the <hi>Witches commaund,</hi> as that,
neyther may hee bee thought to
haue any power else, but what is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
to her lusts, whereas indeede
hee doeth many things of himselfe,
and yet father them vpon the Witch,
to flatter her in her soueraignetie,
and hasten her to vengeance: yea,
exceedeth often the Commission,
which hee receiueth from her. And
though she would <hi>haue</hi> many times
<hi>the mischiefe vndone</hi> and released, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
shee is tormented by such

                        <p>2 That <hi>he is alwayes present in these

of <hi>formes,</hi> so are their <hi>many
Diuells,</hi> that the Witch may the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
glorie in the multitude of these

                        <p>4 That the <hi>Creatures of Almightie

then his manner is, to <hi>set his seale vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them,</hi> thereby to appropriate them

                     </p>
                     <p>This ground being laid, we may

being informed by Satan, know no

doubtfully,</hi> and <hi>deceitfully:</hi> and
therefore must needes deceiue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
and others.</p>
                     <p>This shal appeare the rather, if we
consider the meanes, whereby they
attaine to this knowledge: which
being no ordinance of God, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale

yeelding directly such effects: it
must needs follow, That the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
contriued there-from, procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
from Satans <hi>cunning,</hi> shrowding
his familiaritie and intelligence vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the rule of these creatures, that so
it may not be discernd to come from
him, but rather from the prediction
of the <hi>Rule of Nature:</hi> as also, if it
prooue doubtfull and contrary: <hi>yet
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:16843:85"/>
Sathans credite may be saued:</hi> seeing
he can post it off to the vncertainety
of the Creatures, or some <hi>accident</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
the former prediction.</p>
                     <p>It being most certaine, that as the
knowledge of <hi>Satan of himselfe, is at
the best doubtful &amp; coniecturall in many
things:</hi> so it becomes hereby much

                     </p>
                     <p>What this <hi>varietie of Nature</hi> is, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears

Which, though they allow <hi>some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions</hi>

it must needs follow, that they

the Scriptures also in allotting the

great authoritie and account in the

                     </p>
                     <p>First,<note place="margin">Obiect. 1.</note> because the <hi>Starres are causes

<hi>variable and subordinate,</hi> to the will
of the <hi>Creator,</hi> who can for his

wee should know of</hi> such particulars,

                     <p>2 If it be alleaged,<note place="margin">Obiect. 2.</note> that <hi>What is

                     <p>2 That things <hi>fal out true in particular</hi>
proceeds not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the necessary influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:16843:89"/>
of the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly bodies, but from
the <hi>cunning</hi> of that infernall spirit,
who supplieth by his knowledge,
what is vncertain in that Art, <hi>Insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating</hi>
himselfe into the <hi>minde</hi> of the
<hi>Stargazer,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Note.</note> being now puffed vp with
his knowledge, and desiring successe
therein, to satisfie his pride, what art
cannot make good, he yet desireth
may be accomplished. And so is giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
vp to Satan in a iust punishment of
this his presumption, to be <hi>lessoned</hi> by
him in such further <hi>Euents:</hi> and yet
most <hi>fearfully to be deceiued</hi> by him to,
as shrowding his diuellish inspirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
vnder the cloake of that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
lawfull knowledge.</p>
                     <p>For not to deny that, which the <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence</hi>
of things doth auouch in this
case:</p>
                     <p>True it is,<note place="margin">Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my how far lawfull</note> that the <hi>Sunne</hi> and the

for <hi>signes,</hi> namely, to <hi>distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
Times and Seasons, as Sommer,
Winter, Spring. &amp;c. Alterations of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>
in generall, they are to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:16843:89"/>
of vs: but, that hence we may
gather any <hi>demonstration for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of particulars, to fall out in the
world:</hi> seeing their <hi>grounds</hi> are vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
and the meere fictions of mans
braine, exalting himselfe heerein in
his <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Curiositie,</hi> aboue all that
is called God. It must needes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that this is but a cloake of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans
forgerie, and not any <hi>Art</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable
from the Lord.</p>
                     <p>That thé <hi>grounds are vncertaine and
most deceitfull,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Grounds vncertain.</note> is apparent.</p>
                     <p>1 First,<note place="margin">Reason.</note> Because the <hi>Rules of this
Art haue no Foundation in Experience:</hi>
Seeing both the position of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens,
and the course of the <hi>Starres</hi>
is mutable, and therefore can be no
<hi>Rule</hi> of certayne and immutable
<hi>grounds</hi> (such as the <hi>Principles of Art</hi>
must be.)</p>
                     <p>2 And secondly, there can be <hi>no
certaine Rules giuen</hi> of those things,
<hi>which are not knowne:</hi> Now, who kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
the particular <hi>estate of all the
Starres?</hi> or if he know them, is there
any yet able to discerne <hi>the particular
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:16843:90"/>
vertues of them,</hi> seeing there influences
in the Aire, and vpon the earth, are
confused and vncertaine?</p>
                     <p>3 But the speciall <hi>Reason</hi> of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulnesse
of this <hi>Art,</hi> is <hi>because it
requireth confidence in the same,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Note.</note> nay in
the <hi>Author</hi> therof; They must beleeue
he can resolue them: otherwise if
he come <hi>doubting of his abilitie,</hi> or <hi>in
way of tempting him,</hi> he cannot helpe
him. Now in common vnderstanding
if the <hi>Diuiner</hi> bring the thing to
passe, here must needs be more then
<hi>Art;</hi> For he that is Maister of a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Art, can worke by his <hi>Rules,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a man <hi>beleeue</hi> he can or no: And
therefore it necessarily followeth,
that this <hi>Art</hi> is <hi>Diabolicall,</hi> as <hi>requiring
that seruice which is due onely to God;</hi>
and so thereby entending the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
of the soule, as is apparant by
the <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Confessions</hi> of the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans</hi>

                     <p>Now concerning <hi>prediction by
dreames,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of dreames, how law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and vnlawfull.</note> though it must needes bee

<hi>&amp; 41. 25. Dan. 9. &amp;c</hi> Yet hath Satan

by Dreames and Visions, and so
thereby to enable them to fore-tell

13. 3. <hi>Ier.</hi> 23. 25.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Maistery</hi> will bee how wee
shall discerne and <hi>distinguish betweene
these Dreames:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">How to discerne betweene Diuine &amp; Diabolical Dreames.</note> To this end</p>
                     <p>Let vs take notice that as there
are <hi>Three sorts of dreames:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>1 Such as <hi>prooeed immediately from
the Lord,</hi> as those before,<note place="margin">3 kind of dreames.</note> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
called <hi>Diuine.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Diuine.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>2 <hi>Naturall dreames,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Natural.</note> proceeding
from naturall causes: 1. As thoughts
of the minde: 2. Affections of the
heart; 3. Or constitution of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
according to which sutably
seuerall dreames do follow:<note place="margin">1 From Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion.</note> To <hi>Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lericke</hi>
persons dreames of <hi>Warres,</hi> to
<hi>Phelegmaticke</hi> of <hi>Waters, Fearefull</hi>
dreames to <hi>Melancholicke</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
&amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="146" facs="tcp:16843:92"/>
2 And so also by these Dreames
may we coniecture of <hi>the sinnes of the
heart:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">From con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dition of sinne.</note> because what we conceiue or
practise in the day, will be corruptly
dreamed of in the night, to make vs
more inexcusable.</p>
                     <p>3 Diuellish <hi>Dreames</hi> framed in
the braine by Satan;<note place="margin">Diaboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call.</note> answerable to
our desires, as appeareth not onely
by the practise of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who
receiued their answers by Dreames,
but also by the practise of <hi>Heretikes,</hi>
as the <hi>Maniches, Anabaptists, Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists,
&amp;c.</hi> who haue beene confirmed
in their diuellish errours, by Reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Dreames.</p>
                     <p>Thus, as heereby it is apparant,
there are diuers kindes of Dreames:
so may wee also for our <hi>Instruction,</hi>
obserue many <hi>liuely differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
Diuine and Satanicall Dreames.</hi>
As,</p>
                     <p>First, <hi>diuine Dreames</hi> concerne
Generall and Necessarie things to
bee knowne, as the comming of
<hi>Christ, Reuealing of Antichrist, &amp;c.</hi>
but those from Sathan, are either of
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:16843:92"/>
curious, or triuiall and vaine mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
eyther not fit, or worthie to be
knowne.</p>
                     <p>If it shall be said,<note place="margin">How the Sybilles spake of Christ.</note> That the <hi>Sybills
Satans prophets</hi> spake of these things:
the answere is,</p>
                     <p>1 That so farre as they spake of
them, they had their information
from Satan, who being acquainted
with the <hi>prophecies,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Diffrence betweene Diuine &amp; Diaboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies of Christ.</note> did informe his
disciples accordingly:</p>
                     <p>2 Yet so, as that neyther could he
acquaint them with any <hi>distinct or
cleare knowledge thereof:</hi> but rather
onely in a confused and darke man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
whereby they might rather
<hi>stumble, then informe others</hi> to beleeue
the same, neyther did his prophets
<hi>loue and affect the things that were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed,</hi>
but rather were constrained
to publish so much,<note place="margin">Note.</note> as might make
the times inexcusable, and so had no
power to benefit others thereby.</p>
                     <p>But in Diuine Dreames the
case is cleane contrarie, for in
this place heere is vouchsafed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs, both a verie <hi>cleare</hi> and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:16843:93"/>
                        <hi>manifest reuelation</hi> of such things as
concerne the good of the Church.</p>
                     <p>2 The <hi>minde of Gods seruants</hi> are
affected and subdued to beleeue the
same.</p>
                     <p>3 And they are enabled to <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
so farre vnto others,</hi> as that so
many as are <hi>ordained to saluation</hi> shall
giue credit and obedience therevnto:<note place="margin">Act. 13.</note>
And <hi>the rather,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Because these <hi>Diuine Dreames</hi> are
not onely <hi>agreeable vnto the blessed
Word,</hi> and so safely to bee beleeued,
whereas Satanicall Dreames, as they
are diuerse, or contrary to the Word,
so they labour especially to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
from obedience therevnto.</p>
                     <p>4 But especially, whereas the end
of <hi>Satans Enthusiasmes</hi> is to set vp
<hi>Idolatry,</hi> and <hi>nourish all Atheisme</hi>
and securitie, <hi>Deu.</hi> 13. On the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
<hi>Diuine Dreames</hi> aime onely at the
<hi>True worship of God,</hi> and further the
doctrine and obedience of the
Gospell.</p>
                     <p>5 And heere wee are wisely also
to distinguish of the <hi>Times,</hi> For see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:16843:93"/>
now we haue the <hi>Gospell sufficient
to reueale the will of God,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">No diuine dreames now to be expected.</note> therefore we
are not in these daies to <hi>build</hi> vpon
<hi>Dreames;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2. Tim. 3. 17.</note> so that howsoeuer they
were <hi>ordinary before</hi> and <hi>vnder the

wee are to conclude that it is rather
a <hi>Satanicall illusion</hi> then any <hi>warning
from the Lord,</hi> and therefore at no

                     <p>As touching <hi>Diuination by Lots,</hi>

the feat, as well by himselfe <hi>coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeting

the <hi>circumstance of the Historie</hi> plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
confound them: Howsoeuer they
also imply further, that the <hi>Witch</hi>
might suborne some man or woman

this answere: seeing no <hi>meere hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane

followeth, that the Witch,
by <hi>vertue of the couenant with Satan,</hi>
raised him vp; He by his power and

that is the <hi>Charmer?</hi> signifying there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
that if the <hi>Charmer</hi> come in time,
he might preuent by his charme, the

                     <p>And what else (I pray you) doth
<hi>Balaams words</hi> implie, when being

hee was hired by King <hi>Balaac</hi> by
some <hi>charme</hi> to hurt Gods People,
(as being by Trade no better then a
Coniurer, though in the reputation
of the <hi>ignorant</hi> and <hi>superstitious</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
hee was esteemed a <hi>Prophet</hi>) his
<hi>Charmes</hi> could not preuaile, the <hi>Lord</hi>
disappointed him.</p>
                     <p>And surely,<note place="margin">3 By the nature of a Charme.</note> if wee should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the nature of a Charme, it will
euidently appeare, that it is but a
colourable and counterfeit meanes,
vnder which Sathan shrowdeth his
power and malice to diuine withall,
and so to destroy both bodie and
soule.</p>

                        <pb n="160" facs="tcp:16843:99"/>
Seeing a <hi>Charme</hi> is no other then
a <hi>spell consisting of strange words,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">A charme, what.</note> wherin
<hi>is pretended some secret efficacie, to bring
forth some extraordinarie worke.</hi> It ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
followeth, 1 that by the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>nature of the words,</hi> and 2 <hi>qualitie of
the parties</hi> that vse them, they are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>better
then Sathans <hi>cloaks</hi> to conuey
his mischiefes more closely, for the
endangering of the soule.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>words</hi> are either barbarous &amp;
vnknowne,<note place="margin">Words of charmes, either ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure &amp; barbarous</note> as were such, which in
times of Ignorance and Infidelitie
were vsed. And that these could
work no such effect, it appeareth:</p>
                     <p>1 because this was no <hi>ordinance of
God</hi> to this end, as hauing neither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
power thereto by <hi>right of creation,</hi>
or by any <hi>new institution,</hi> and <hi>gift from
God:</hi> That they haue no <hi>power by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of creation,</hi> it is manifest, 1 because
<hi>words</hi> are but <hi>sounds,</hi> and so passe into
<hi>the aire,</hi> without any further effect.</p>
                     <p>2 If they had power <hi>to hurt,</hi> or <hi>do
good,</hi> it must needes be by some <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guitie</hi>
and presence with the thing it
works vpon; &amp; therfore seeing these
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:16843:99"/>
words are spoken concerning <hi>parties
and things assent,</hi> and farre distant,
and therefore they haue no power,
as is pretended.</p>
                     <p>And if <hi>some words</hi> should be effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall
of themselues: why then not
all <hi>words</hi> of all sorts, tending to bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
or cursing: but this is presumed,
that onely words <hi>proceeding from such
cunning men and women,</hi> are auailea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
and therfore it is not the words
themselues, but some other secret
<hi>Magicall</hi> compact with such persons
that effect the same.</p>
                     <p>If it be replyed,<note place="margin">Obiect.</note> that these wordes

                        <note place="margin">Answ.</note> and happily be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
of the parties that vse them
reciprocally:<note place="margin">Or blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous knowne charmes.</note> Yet seeing they haue
in themselues no further vse then for
what they signifie, and though they
be vnderstoode, as the <hi>charmes</hi> are
now, as <hi>being of knowne names,</hi> and
yet still can they not of themselues
further auayle, then to the <hi>Ends</hi>
they were appoynted. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it followeth, that they are no

<pb n="162" facs="tcp:16843:100"/>
to Satan</hi> to worke his wonders by.</p>
                     <p>For though the name of <hi>the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie

they were appoynted, namely, to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
the soule: yet to effect wonders
by these, seeing it is contrary <hi>to their
Institution, &amp;c.</hi> that blessing of God
especially accompanying them, it fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth,
that when they are abused
to other ends, as in <hi>charmes. &amp;c.</hi> they
are the <hi>diuells sacraments,</hi> to effect his
trickes, by vertue of the <hi>compact</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene

he seemes to be bound and compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to serue hir turn, the rather here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to colour the wickednesse, as if
now it were done by the power of
God, resembled in these words, and
not by the <hi>illusion</hi> &amp; <hi>cunning</hi> of Satan.</p>
                     <p>As for the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>Imagination</hi> in

though it cannot be denyed, but
that our <hi>imaginatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may hurt our selues:</hi>
yet that the <hi>imagination of the Witch</hi>
should hurt others, or that these
words poceeding from her conceit,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:16843:100"/>
should so preuaile on the bodies and
minds of such as are afarre off, it is
contrary to reason, &amp; common sense.</p>
                     <p>And therefore,<note place="margin">Infectious lookes dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed.</note> though it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited,
that <hi>the Witch by her lookes may
effect these things:</hi> or hauing some <hi>poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonous

this hurt those which are absent?</p>
                     <p>Neither wil it further this dotage,<note place="margin">Obiection of Iacobs sheepe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered.</note>
that either <hi>Iacobs sheep, by looking vpon

not any inherent vertue in the rods,
or the eies of the sheep, bicause heere
was som likelihood in nature hereto.</p>
                     <p>Much lesse shal that preuaile,<note place="margin">2 Obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Basiliske and Wolfe answered.</note> that

as there is no ground of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
concerning these things, but
onelie a common receiued errour:
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:16843:101"/>
so; if any such thing be, it may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
from some force in Nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
to those creatures, as the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siliske

effecting such stange things.</p>
                     <p>But they alledge further,<note place="margin">Obiect. 3. Answ.</note> if En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanters

the stinging of Serpents, then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely
there is some force in these

                     <p>Vnto which we answer, That the
power proceedeth not from any ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
in the wordes, but by the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of Satan through compact with the
Charmer,</hi> as the word is plaine, ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
sometimes very cunningly with
the diuell, seeing no other, although

like things.</p>
                     <p>If it be said,<note place="margin">Obiect. 4. Of the parties.</note> this is, bicause he hath
not the <hi>same faith:</hi> this discouers the
<hi>roote of bitternesse,</hi> and argueth them
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:16843:101"/>
plainely to be Diabolicall: as being
both the <hi>bond</hi> of the <hi>Couenant,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
Satan is tied to the <hi>Witch:</hi> he doth
all on this condition, that hee is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
as her god, shee must
<hi>trust in him,</hi> resigne vp her selfe who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to his pleasure.</p>
                     <p>As also by this bond, the <hi>Witch
tieth her Proselites to her dispose:</hi> shee
can doe nothing for them, vnlesse
<hi>they beleeue in her,</hi> and so she enthral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
their soules, while she pretends
good to their bodies.</p>
                     <p>This will yet appeare more eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
if we consider the <hi>qualitie of the
best</hi> and <hi>most colourable charmes,</hi> that
are vsed to this end: Namely, <hi>wordes
of holy Scripture:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture char.</note> which seeing they
haue their vertue not <hi>from him that
vttereth them,</hi> much lesse from the
<hi>power of the words</hi> in themselues, but
from the <hi>alone efficacie of the Spirite of
God,</hi> annexed by GODS promise
heereunto, when the word is vsed as
his ordinance: seeing therefore this
is no <hi>ordinance of God</hi> to such ends, &amp;
therefore can not proceede from the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:16843:102"/>
operation of the good spirit of God:
it followes necessarily, that it is the
power of satan, shrouded vnder these
formes of speech, especially, seeing it
is not vsed <hi>to the conuersion of sinners,</hi>
which is the right end; but to wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
or vnnecessarie purposes, as <hi>ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of diuells, killing of creatures, infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the aire, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And seeing the <hi>word</hi> is onely effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall,<note place="margin">Word how effectual.</note>
not by reason of the sound, er

as being in an vnknowne <hi>tongue,</hi>
2 <hi>without faith,</hi> and 3 <hi>to wicked pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses.</hi>

the course of Nature:<note place="margin">That Iuggling is sorcery.</note> As this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
this Trade to be <hi>plaine Sorcery;</hi>
because it exceeds Natures compas,
so it necessarily followeth that some
skill of <hi>Satan</hi> is concurring heerein,
As being by compact with the <hi>Iug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi>
to colour and further him herein;
either by corrupting the humour of
the eye, or colouring the aire, &amp;c.
which are things possible for <hi>Satan</hi>
to do.<note place="margin">That iuggling is not by opticke skill.</note> For howsoeuer some strange
things may bee done by <hi>bodily sleights</hi>
and by <hi>Opticke Arts,</hi> yet these are
kept within the compasse of nature:
But the <hi>Iuggler</hi> vndertakes things
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:16843:105"/>
impossible and contrarie to Nature,
as <hi>to transforme one creature into an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
or else, to <hi>create and offer things
that are not,</hi> and so seemeth to arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
<hi>diuine power,</hi> in such workes of
Creation, and therefore must needes
delude onlie the eye with the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of such things, seeing he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
possibly do the things indeed.</p>
                     <p>Such were the wonders wrought
by the <hi>Egyptian Enchanters,</hi> in imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Moses,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Egyptian Enchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters onely deluded the eye.</note> when they <hi>turned the
Rodde into a Serpent,</hi> and <hi>waters into
bloud:</hi> which, that it was a plaine
delusion of the eye, by Sathans for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerie,
is manifest, because they could
not be any reall creatures: seeing the
<hi>Lord</hi> did not make them, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
could not, the workes of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie
Creation ceasing, and no spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
reason now to be giuen, whie
myraculously anie such Creation
should be renued by those seruants
of <hi>Pharaoh:</hi> but rather plaine reason
for the contrarie, seeing this they
did, tended to the disgrace of Gods
worke, by his seruants <hi>Moses</hi> and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:16843:106"/>
                        <hi>Aaron,</hi> and therefore though they
could haue done such a worke, yet
the Lord at this time would not haue
endured it at their hands.</p>
                     <p>But it is most apparant that Satan
can doe no such thing, seeing the
effecting of the like belongs onely
to God, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. And the Word is
plaine, that this their fained miracle
was done by Sorcery, <hi>Exod.</hi> 7. 11. 22.
<hi>&amp;</hi> 8. 7. And therefore that the
Lord should do them against him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
it is altogether absurd and
blasphemous to grant: And the <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances</hi>
doe plainely euince that
they were not <hi>naturall frogs,</hi> by such
<hi>differences</hi> as are manifest betweeue
them, and those that <hi>Moses</hi> created
by the finger of God.</p>
                     <p>As 1. That the <hi>Frogges created by
Moses</hi> caused great <hi>stincke</hi> by the
corruption that they bred, being ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
on heapes, whereas there is
no such ascribed to the <hi>Frogges of the
Enchanters.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so the <hi>bloud which Moses
brought forth, killed the fish, and stancke</hi>
                        <pb n="175" facs="tcp:16843:106"/>
so that the <hi>Egiptians</hi> could not drink
thereof; no such effect appearing
from the <hi>Magitians Transmutation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And is it likely that they which
could haue created these frogges,
could not also haue destroyed the
lice? Could not haue preserued them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
from those fearefull plagues?
<hi>Exod.</hi> 8. 18. Nay they confesse that
they were not able to bring forth
lice by their enchantment, much
lesse destroy them.</p>
                     <p>And seeing that <hi>Moses serpents de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured
them,</hi> and yet retained their
former quality, it necessarily follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that they were no true serpents,
the rather because vsually <hi>one crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

                     </p>
                     <p>And surely why could they not

make the same?</p>

                        <p>A third thing in this description,

                        </p>
                        <p>It being the <hi>Pride of Satan</hi> to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance
himselfe heereby as <hi>God,</hi> in

by these manifold trickes and

                           <pb n="180" facs="tcp:16843:109"/>
and <hi>Idolatrie,</hi> and to hinder them
from <hi>embracing the glorious Gospell of

end, by his instruments, sometimes
true, as by <hi>Diuinations</hi> and <hi>Charmes,</hi>
and otherwise fayned workes, as
by <hi>Iugling,</hi> to <hi>puffe</hi> them vp al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
with a vaine conceipt of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine

to eternall vengeance, by ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
them heereby to execute their
seuerall lusts with greedinesse, and
vsing them as dangerous instruments
to deceiue others.</p>
                        <p>Such were <hi>Balaam,</hi> the <hi>Inchanters

                        <p>By which description and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
the first <hi>Question is resolued,</hi>
namely, <hi>that men, as well as women,
may be subiect to this Trade;</hi> seeing as
both are subiect to the State of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:16843:109"/>
so both are liable to Satans
snares, who hath seuerall trickes and
colours, in this <hi>Mysterie of iniquitie,</hi>
to <hi>bait</hi> each according to their seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
abilities and vses in the world,
thereby the rather to fetch them ouer
to this detestable Art.</p>
                        <p>For whereas man by <hi>Ordination</hi> is
fitter to <hi>command,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">How Satan baitesmen and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersly to this Trade.</note> and the <hi>woman to

so sutable a point in this Trade,
as to lead him thereto, with <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Soueraignety,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Note.</note> that he shall

and solemne manner, colouring the

of <hi>Circles, Characters, &amp;c.</hi> to this

high skill of coniuration. By the
which ceremonies and solemnities
as <hi>Satan</hi> procureth in the minde of
ambitious and curious man some
higher conceipt of this soueraigne
skill; so doth he thereby more
deepely cozen him, as fetching
him of more roundly heereby to the

his soule in hope of this

                        <p>To this end we may obserue, that
though the <hi>maine end bee one,</hi> in these
<hi>Diabolicall Arts,</hi> euen to enthrall the
soule in perpetuall bondage, yet hath
<hi>Satan</hi> diuers meanes to attaine these
ends, both answerable to the <hi>seuerall
conditions of the world,</hi> and <hi>particular
estates and qualities of men:</hi> Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to which diuersitie, this Art,
though it bee one in effect, yet hath
it obtained diuers <hi>names, and sundry
respects.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Concerning <hi>the Times,</hi> as they
haue obtained more or lesse light of
the knowledge of God, so hath
Satan fitted himselfe in his policies
accordingly. When, and where,
there hath beene <hi>none,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Note Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of times with seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall baites.</note> or <hi>lesse reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of the Gospell,</hi> there hath <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi>
appearances and workings
beene more <hi>carnall</hi> and preceptible

his attempts more open and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:16843:110"/>
his worship more terrible to the

<hi>vgly shapes,</hi> being <hi>worshipped in most
horrible formes, presented with most
cruell and bloudie sacrifices,</hi> and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<hi>with all grosse and shamelesse open
filthinesse.</hi> So did the <hi>Heathen,</hi> in their
first rude and barbarous estate, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
the deuill; then needed <hi>they no

when they acknowledged no
other God but him: him they serued
that he might doe them good; him
they worshipped for <hi>feare,</hi> least he
should hurt them.</p>
                        <p>As <hi>Barbarousnesse decayed,</hi> and <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilitie,
by setled Gouernement, beganne
to take place, &amp;c.</hi> so <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>skill</hi>
was aduanced among men, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
grosse wickednesse was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
brideled, and morall honestie,
for the common and priuate good
sake, was now outwardly embraced;
Herevpon Satan spinnes a finer thrid
of more colourable idolatrie, and
that by these meanes. <hi>Benefactors of
Common-wealthes,</hi> and Deliuerers of
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:16843:111"/>
their Countries from <hi>Tyrants,</hi> not
<hi>knowing God,</hi> were apt to <hi>robbe him of

and eternizing, by their <hi>Renowmed

                        </p>
                        <p>This Satan discerning, doth easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie

his skill and power <hi>enables them
to doe Wonders;</hi> Heerevpon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
cry, The <hi>Voyce of God and not of

the rather, because the ignorant
and godlesse people, receiuing
good from them, cannot bee
contained in any sober measure of
respect towards them, but thinke
euen all Diuine Honour too little
for them. So wee finde that <hi>Heathen
Princes</hi> were many of them great
<hi>Magitians</hi> and <hi>Coniurers,</hi> as gaining
hereby an <hi>Opinion of Dietie:</hi> And
so did the people worship them with

being translated among the number

                        </p>
                        <p>Thus became this <hi>Art of Sorcerie</hi>

                        <p>And was there not another means
heerein to set vp this Art, in that age
of Knowledge, and greater Ciuility?
Yea certainly.</p>
                        <p>As conquest brought forth <hi>Peace,</hi>
so Peace yeelded <hi>libertie for knowledge</hi>
and <hi>liberall studies:</hi> And Knowledge

satisfied, and <hi>pride</hi> nourished, and
the soule through Pride enthralled
to Sathan, and yet deluded iustly
with the same colour of <hi>Art:</hi> vnder
which Sathan hiding his <hi>secret com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacts</hi>
doeth eyther perswade

done indeede by his <hi>assistance,</hi> or sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfies

neede not feare subiection to Satan.
Hitherto serued those <hi>Charmes, Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
Characters, &amp;c.</hi> by which Satan
seeming to be bound, deluded them
with a vaine conceit of his subiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

<hi>Ages</hi> of the world, and diuerse
<hi>dispositions and affections of men,</hi> in the
enticing of them to this <hi>Mysterie;</hi>
so doth he not want his dangerous

and that by <hi>limiting his

each, that so they may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
each other in their Trade,
and by their mutuall references to
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:16843:120"/>
each other, doe more mischiefe in the
world.</p>
                     <p>And therefore as <hi>Feare</hi> and <hi>Loue</hi>
are two speciall bonds to bind to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,<note place="margin">Policie of Satanin li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting of his power to Bad Witches.</note>
therefore hath the Diuine

<hi>onely to do hurt,</hi> that so such as will

stand <hi>in awe</hi> of the <hi>deuill,</hi> and of the

                     </p>
                     <p>And so contrariwise, there are

                     </p>
                     <p>I say <hi>sutable it is to the seuerall qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities

themselues.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yea certainely, the <hi>Bad Witch, by
hurting,</hi> makes way for the <hi>good Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
helpe,</hi> and so thereby encreaseth
her sinne; and the <hi>Good Witch in hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
bewrayes the Bad Witch,</hi> and so,

                     <p>The <hi>Good Witch in helping</hi> makes

suspected, reuengeth her selfe vsually

thereby ripens her sinne to the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes,
and so still makes <hi>more worke
for the Blesser</hi> to encrease her condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
The <hi>Bad Witch,</hi> because she
doth hurt, is <hi>hated of the world,</hi> and so
thereby encreaseth her malice, and
doth more harme. <hi>The good Witch is
honoured,</hi> and reputed as a God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
she doth good, and so is <hi>harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

cunningly and dangerously deceiue
euen the <hi>professors of this Age,</hi> whom

                        </p>

But whereas in their <hi>affliction they
should seeke vnto the Lord</hi> that smites
them,<note place="margin">Os. 6. 1.</note> by this discouery of the <hi>Bad

people more eagerly to runne after
her.</p>
                        <p>And now the <hi>Good Witch</hi> vttereth
easily all her deceitfull wares, to the

concerning the supposed <hi>harmer and
Bad Witch,</hi> therefore she hath vsually
either <hi>some glasse</hi> wherein to shew

<hi>certaine deceitfull and Satanicall expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments,</hi>
to confirme her former de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
of the <hi>Witch;</hi> As namely, by
<hi>casting her into the water, sticking of

where she sits, burning of the thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched,
&amp;c.</hi> By which, either she con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes
the superstitious people in a

or if they conceiue aright, yet by
<hi>vsing these indirect meanes for discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi>
they shall yet deeplier engage
their soules vnto the power and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
of Satan.</p>
                        <p>And therefore though the Bad
Witch may bee detected by these
meanes: yet neither is the wise Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
to vse these meanes for the <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couery
of this Monster;</hi> neither is the

                           <hi>Touching Examination;</hi> This is,
when the <hi>Magistrate</hi> makes enquiry
concerning this crime, and that not

Presumptions, probably</hi> coniecturing
of the Witch.</p>
                        <p>These are:</p>
                        <p>1 <hi>Notorious defamation of this
crime,</hi> by the most of neighbours
which are of the best report.</p>
                        <p>2 The <hi>Accusation of a fellow Witch,</hi>
either at examination, or <hi>at the day
of death</hi> is not to bee neglected, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
now <hi>Authoritie</hi> hauing seized
on hit, though she may <hi>lie</hi> before she

and cleare the innocent, by speaking
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:16843:156"/>
truth, &amp;c. (though otherwise shee
would not) to accuse the delinquent.</p>
                        <p>3 <hi>A third presumption is from the
effect of cursing:</hi> For when a bad ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued
woman shall <hi>curse</hi> a partie, and
<hi>death</hi> shortly follow, this is a shrewd
token that shee is a <hi>Witch,</hi> because
<hi>Witches</hi> are accustomed to execute
their mischeuous practises by <hi>cursing</hi>
and <hi>banning,</hi> &amp; this may be sufficient
for <hi>examinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> thogh not of <hi>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uiction.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>4 If after <hi>Enmity, quarreling,</hi> or
<hi>threatning,</hi> a <hi>present mischief</hi> do folow.</p>
                        <p>5 If the partie suspected be anie
<hi>kim,</hi> or of <hi>Special acquaintance with a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                              <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uicted
Witch,</hi> because it is the manner
of them to conuey their <hi>Trades</hi> and
<hi>Spirits</hi> one to another, and especially
to those that are nearest about, and
most familiar with them.</p>
                        <p>6 It is obserued, that the <hi>Witch</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues
som <hi>mark</hi> from Satan to owne
her by, in some priuy place, which is
vsually raw, whence the spirit draws
bloud, &amp;c. and this, if there be no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reason in Nature, is a shrewd
presumption, to examine at least.</p>

7 And so if in examination wee
find the partie <hi>contrarie and in diuers
Tales:</hi> not onely <hi>Fearefull,</hi> for this may
be in a good case; but <hi>Doubtfull</hi> and
<hi>Different,</hi> this may bee a <hi>Presumption</hi>
to argue a guiltie conscience:</p>

                        <p>Now concerning <hi>Examination,</hi> this
may either be made by <hi>Question from
the Magistrate,</hi> by certaine <hi>wise</hi> and
<hi>crosse Interrogations</hi> to this end:</p>
                        <p>Or else <hi>by Torture,</hi> when together
with words, some violent meanes
are vsed, by paine, to extort confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which may haue necessarie place
when the partie is obstinate.</p>
                        <p>3 Of Conuiction.</p>
                        <p>Hauing vsed the best meanes by
<hi>Examination,</hi> the next is <hi>Conuiction,</hi>
whereby after iust examination, the
<hi>Witch</hi> is discouered; To this must
concurre, not bare <hi>presumptions,</hi> but
<hi>sufficient Proofes:</hi> Not such as heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
haue beene reckoned, or like
to those; As <hi>scratching the suspected

some knowne <hi>practise of Witch-craft,</hi>
producing likely arguments for the

                        <p>1 That <hi>the Witch hath called vpon

                        </p>
                        <p>2 That <hi>she entertaines a familiar

                        </p>
                        <p>4 That they haue <hi>fore-told things

vnto God, when wee come vnto

and <hi>consecrating them to the seruice of

                        <p>3 To make <hi>choice of our habitations</hi>

are to leaue things to the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,</hi>

                        <p>This in generall hath beene the

<hi>Abraham building an altar</hi> where hee
dwelt, to worship God, <hi>Genes.</hi> 12. 8.

therefore we may not simply neglect

wee doe it from a good ground:

to doe their soules good:

prooue, <hi>That thou shalt not suffer a

                        <p>And so <hi>the practise of Holy men,</hi> hath
been agreeable thereunto in the due
Execution of this sentence against
them in all ages. As appeareth:</p>
                        <p>Not onely among <hi>the Heathen,</hi>
who euen by the Light of Nature
were endued for the very safety of

                           <pb n="312" facs="tcp:16843:175"/>
But especially <hi>among Christians</hi>
where generally such <hi>Malefactors</hi> are
condignely punished.</p>
                        <p>And that <hi>this practice ought to stand

                        <p>1. Because, this being a <hi>Iudiciall

                        <p>And this sincerity of Iustice doth

                           <note place="margin">Note.</note> yet for the offence

the <hi>Blesser,</hi> that raigneth among vs:

in euerie parish, and <hi>placing in stead
thereof a conscionable Minister,</hi> as that
the people may require the Lawe at
his mouth, that he may pray to the

                        <p>2 Let this teach him to punish
sinne, of conscience, not for by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects,
meeting with the Witch, as

so much as a murtherer sinning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

                        <p>3 Let <hi>his owne safetie</hi> mooue him

It is now apparant, That not onely

themselues to his cursed will, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
their saluation,</hi> to become

as if there were no <hi>God to Iudge them,</hi>
no diuell to torment them? Do not
their desperate courses plainely dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer
to whom they doe belong?
Are they not of their father the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell,
because his <hi>workes they doe,</hi> are
they not running headlong to Hell,
by their desperate impenitencie?
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:16843:180"/>
doth their damnation <hi>sleepe,</hi> that so
turne the grace of God into wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonnesse?

                     <p>SEeing there is naturally in euerie
<hi>Christian the seeds &amp; grounds of such
euills,</hi> which may draw, as by these
degrees, 1 to the <hi>approbation</hi> of this

retaine <hi>vnder pretence of Charitie, these
cursed instruments,</hi> and so to grow <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
with them,</hi> to <hi>conceiue well of their
prayers, &amp;c.</hi> Seeing (I say) by these
degrees, &amp; such like; vnstable soules
may easily be ensnared, and drawne
on to this <hi>diuellish compact:</hi> therefore
let vs learne also to <hi>preuent this feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
league.</hi> To this end,</p>
                     <p>Let vs take heed of <hi>liuing in grosse</hi>
and <hi>wilfull ignorance:</hi> And while wee
<hi>haue the light,</hi> let vs embrace it cons<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cionably,
lest we be giuen vp for our
disobedience to these strong delusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                     <p>2 <hi>Let vs be thorowly perswaded of the

                     <p>3 But specially apprehend we <hi>that

he hath taken the soule of man into
his especiall protection; as hauing
elected vs to saluation, before the

and that in Iesus Christ, to the praise
of his glorious grace: that so we may
neither <hi>thinke our soules to bee at our

Wherein I haue spared <hi>the seueral Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legations,</hi>

And if any thing ouer &amp; besides hath
