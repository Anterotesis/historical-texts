            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>Pon the ſhore of <hi>Barſelon,</hi> betweene the plankes of a Ship which had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered wracke; there appeared as if it had beene a fardell of cloath couered with weedes: which being perceiued by ſome Fiſhermen, they tooke it into their Barke, and carryed it along the ſhore about the ſpace of two Miles, where vnder the ſhade of ſome Trees, they clenſed away the weeds &amp; mud, and found that it was a man in a trance, who was almoſt paſt ſence, and without life. Theſe Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers moued with compaſſion, with ſome branches cut from an olde Oake, kindled a fire, and he who had been ſo neere the looſing of his Life, now recouering it, let them know what Countriman he was, by his complaint: diſcouered his admiration by his lookes; and the feeling hee had of the good, which they had done him, by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:14312:5"/>
which he had to acknowledge it. Nature doing the accuſtomable office of a pittifull mother, ſent his blood to reſtore the more infeebled parts; and hauing brought him almoſt to his former ſtrength, hee was about to haue diſcouered himſelfe: But not thinking it fit in ſo ſtrange a fortune, he concealed his birth &amp; name: Only ſaying, that this Ship ſuffering wracke in the ſea, and ceazing of theſe plankes which the Waues had caſt vpon the ſhore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he was two dayes floating amongſt the billowes of the Sea, who ſometimes pittifull and then againe cruell, did bring him neare, and farther from the Land, vntill ſuch time that the refluxe of the water vanquiſhing the impetuoſitie of the tempeſt, he was caſt vpon the ſandes, where the violence of the ſtroke hauing as it were plowed vp his tombe, hee thought himſelfe buryed. His returne hee ſaid was from <hi>Italy,</hi> and the occaſion of his voyage, the indulgences of the <hi>Iubile,</hi> which was while <hi>Clement</hi> the Eight ſate Biſhop. And ſighing much, amongſt the broken ſpeeches of his ſtory, hee let them vnderſtand that he wanted a compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his trauels, of whom there was no newes to be had, as it ſeldome hapneth that thoſe who doe free vs from bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily misfortunes, can alſo eaſe thoſe of the minde: So he reſted this day within one of their Cabens, while the colde night diſcending, all crowned with ſtarres, did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part vnto mortall Creatures reſt conformable vnto the quality of their liues, giuing deſires vnto the poore, cares vnto the rich, complaints vnto the ſad, vnto the conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſleepe, and iealouſie vnto the amourous; In the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt whereof, he heard a <hi>Lyra</hi> played vpon, and according with a voyce, which in ſinging complained of a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſſes cruelty. The Pilgrim who although hee were
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:14312:5"/>
weary, was yet more amorous, and loued Muſique ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then reſt, went out of his Caben into a meadow, from whence ſeeing about a dozen Houſes, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ſome Oziers, the Author of thoſe plaints, Hee called him a great way off: the other anſwered with feare, But the pale light of the Moone, which hid vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the mantle of a Cloude, beheld the ſecrets of the night, made him ſee that it was a poore man, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out armes: hee then ſhewed him a little lower a planke lying amongſt reedes ouer a little Brooke, vnto which the ſolitarineſſe of the place, and ſilence of the night did giue no ſubiect of murmuring: which when hee had paſſed, they ſaluted one the other curteouſly, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, he which came (for ſtrangers are alwayes curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous out of neceſſity) and ſate downe together vpon the Graſſe.</p>
            <p>Already had the Pilgrim informed himſelfe of the name of this Village, of the Lord therof, and how farre it was diſtant from <hi>Barcelon,</hi> when they vnlooked for, ſaw two men comming who in ſtead of ſaluting them preſented two Harquebuſhes to their faces, &amp; a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand feares in their hearts; The ſtranger tolde them, that they could take nothing from him but his life which hee eſteemed little, and ſixe houres agone much leſſe: the other ſaid hee was the ſonne of a Seaman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene a Fiſherman and a Pilate, and that all his goods conſiſted in this his Inſtrument, with which hee did charme his cares. The Souldiers, did not witnes any deſire vnto their clothes, becauſe one was of Canuas, &amp; the other of courſe cloth; And there is no Robber who is not liberall of that which is of no worth. But they
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:14312:6"/>
intreated them to conduct them vnto the Village, which in regard of the incertainty of the way, they could not finde in a great time. The Fiſherman tolde them that in recompence of their curteſie, hee would aduiſe them not to goe, foraſmuch as the Inhabitants were a warlike people, and did not willingly lodge men of their faſhion: And that it would be a thing impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to eſcape from their hands if they were diſcouered; becauſe, that vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſounding of the firſt Laram, all the other Villages wold anſwer them, from whence would come a multitude of Laborers, who with diuers Armes would ſtop the paſſages, and they knew the wayes ſo well, that there was neither Brooke, Tree, nor Rocke, which they had not at their fingers ends. To this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell the Bandoleers replyed, that they were not alone; but that there was aboue Fifty in their troope, fighting vnder the colours of a <hi>Catalonian</hi> Knight, who had been iniured by another more mighty then hee, in meanes and Parents, although not in force, reaſon, nor courage: Hardly, had they ended theſe wordes, when by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection of the ſtarres, they ſawe the Armes of the ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron and Captaine, which they ſpoke of. And now being ioyned all together, they lodged by force in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers houſes of this Village; The Pilgrim curious to learne (a generall inclination of all ſuch as trauaile in forraigne Countries) mingled himſelfe amongſt the Souldiers no way diſliking his company, but contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe inuited him to ſupper: after which the floore ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them for Beds, they entertained one the other with diſcourſe, vntill the ſlowe morning then at the end of February, roſe out of the armes of her ſpouſe;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:14312:6"/>
they knew from the Pilgrim his Fortune, and hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſirous to learne from them the cauſe of ſo euill an aſſured life, his feature and his vnderſtanding being very agreeable vnto them, one of them called <hi>Ramond,</hi> told it in this manner.</p>

               <p>IN this famous Citty, which with a wonderfull greatnes oppoſeth <hi>Italy,</hi> and aſtoniſheth <hi>Africke;</hi> there was borne a Lady of noble Parentage, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing been a firebrand vnto her Countrey, had no ſmall conformity with the Greeke <hi>Helen:</hi> her name was <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinda,</hi> her beauty heauenly, and her ſpirit diuine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing attained vnto yeares fit for Marriage, two Knights equall in youth, greatnes of meanes, and Noblenes of blood, did ſeeke her Loue, with like hope; but vnlike fauour. Loue, naturall inclination, a ſimpathy of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, or an influens of the ſtarres, did conſtraine <hi>Florin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> to loue <hi>Doricles,</hi> and to hate <hi>Filander,</hi> who to ſhorten his way betweene hope and poſſeſſion, and to preuent his riuall, demaunded her in Marriage of her Parents, who would willingly haue kept the reſpect which they ought vnto the interceſſors and his merites, if they had not found that <hi>Florinda</hi> had loſt, when they gaue know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the husband, which they propounded vnto her; They loued her tenderly and would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine her with rigor, but treating freely with <hi>Filander,</hi> they tolde him, that ſhee would not agree vnto it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they had perſwaded her as maſters, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded as Parents. <hi>Filander</hi> augmenting his loue by

the diſdaine, informed himſelfe of the cauſe, and found that the loue which <hi>Florinda</hi> bare vnto <hi>Dorricles,</hi> was cauſe of the diſdaine which ſhe bare to him, preſently did accuſe in his imagination reuenge, and a reſolution to remoue out of the world, the obſtacle of his deſigne; no whit reſpecting, the ſcandals, and the euill ſucceſſe which ſo hardy an enterpriſe might bring, hee armed himſelfe with ſuch company as hee thought good (as he who was not vnprouided of friends nor wanted ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants) at ſuch times as he thought hee ſhould finde <hi>Dorricles</hi> at his Miſtreſſes doore, or in the ſtreete by her houſe, who doubting of his riual<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

Then of either ſide they increaſed their bands;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:14312:7"/>
the fire of their anger kindled all their Parents; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they euery day ſpake together as if they had no quarrell, they failed not to ſight euery night when they met. In this ſcandall <hi>Dorricles</hi> loſt the enioying of his Miſtres, <hi>Filander</hi> her fauour; ſhe her renowne, and their Parents their honour; time increaſed the Loue of the one, and the others hatred increaſed his deſire of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge, and of the ſmall pleaſure which the two Louers had, <hi>Filander</hi> had leſt, vnto whom it ſeemed better in this buſines to relye vpon his induſtry, for the effecting whereof his force would be wanting.</p>
               <p>Hauing then learned that <hi>Florinda</hi> was to take her pleaſure at Sea in a Barke, hee hid two or three dayes before, a Brigantine in a creeke not farre from the ſhore, in which he apparelled himſelfe like a Turke, with ſome other of his friends (for complices in amorous enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes are ſeldome wanting) and with neceſſary Rowers attendeth his Miſtres: the Meuxin, which is the Tower where the watch of <hi>Barcelon</hi> is kept, hauing diſcouered no enemies ſayle in all the Sea. In the meane time the contented <hi>Florinda</hi> with her companions, was not gone from the ſhore a League, when as the counterfeit Frigot hoyſing ſayles, and beating the water with her owers, inueſteth her Barke, the Marriners whereof loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king for nothing leſſe then ſuch a ſurpriſe, could not reſolue either to flye or to defend themſelues; But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe (as the fearefull bird ſeeing the proude Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin come fiercely ſtooping vpon her, is accuſtomed to attend her with couched wings) acknowledging by the Turky ſayles, the power of their enemies which were vpon them, quitted their owers; and feare (which with

The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets in vaine ſpurred vp and downe vpon the Coaſt, But <hi>Filander</hi> (who had brought <hi>Florinda</hi> into a priuate Garden houſe, hauing taken away his Turban, and his Turkiſh diſguiſe) declared vnto her, that the incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable force of his loue, had conſtrained him to haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe vnto this ſubtilty, did enioy her beauty with aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, although ſhee tooke Heauen, the Trees and the Fountaines to witnes the violence which was vſed to her.</p>
               <p>Of no leſſe conſideration was <hi>Dorricles</hi> his paine, who full of mortall ſorrow, was a thouſand times vpon the Sea ſide ready to imitate the diſpaire of thoſe Nimphes which ſawe <hi>Europa</hi> rauiſhed; neuertheles, as well to obliege vnto him his Miſtreſſes parents, as to ſatisfie himſelfe, hee bought a Ship of an <hi>Arrogonis,</hi>

diſpoſeth himſelfe to dye, and made it appeare, that he had the courage of a Knight, and the ſoule of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian; Neuertheles the Viceroy, and the Biſhop, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing their authority, aſſembled the Parents, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing mollified the neereſt, diſwaded <hi>Filanders</hi> death, in reſpecting the honour which they might gaine by his life; So of two euils chooſing the leaſt, they had more care to the reparation of their honour, then to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment of reuenge; Thus they changed the mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning which was already prouided for <hi>Filander,</hi> into nuptiall habits, and the ſcaffold into a bed, where <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinda</hi> was giuen him in lawfull Marriage: but the ſame day that they gaue hands with the contentment and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing of all the world, <hi>Doricles</hi> entred into the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and vnlooked for appeared in the head of two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men, whom hee had drawen out of Captiuity, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whoſe Caſſaques did ſhine in ſiluer Brodery the Armes of <hi>Barcelon</hi> and their reſtorer; His word was <hi>I loue the King.</hi> The ſight and entry of this heroique Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen, was exceedingly agreeable and deare vnto the <hi>Barcelonians;</hi> But the inſupportable newes of his riuals Marriage, with his Miſtres was no ſooner come vnto <hi>Doricles</hi> his eares, but all the City in armes were diuided into factions, and contrary parties. This ſuſpended the Marriage for ſome dayes, during which time it was remonſtrated vnto <hi>Doricles,</hi> that hee could not marry with <hi>Florinda</hi> without infamy. He anſwered that what he could not haue, ought not to be giuen to <hi>Filander,</hi> it being no way reaſonable that this deceiuer ſhould gaine by fraude, what he had loſt by ſo much trauell; and there was no other meanes to accord him,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:14312:9"/>
but that <hi>Florinda</hi> ſhould retire into a Monaſtery. To this her Parents contradicted already contented with the ſatisfaction of their Honour, and the aliance of their Sonne in Law, whoſe Parents offered vnto <hi>Dori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> a beautifull Siſter of <hi>Filanders</hi> in marriage; But hee vnwilling thereunto, demaunded Iuſtice againſt <hi>Filan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> for his crime, offering, that after he ſhould bee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed hee would marry <hi>Florinda</hi> as widdow vnto a Knight. This laſt offer was artificially agreed vnto by <hi>Filanders</hi> and <hi>Florinda's</hi> parents, who marryed them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and when <hi>Doricles</hi> thought that <hi>Filander</hi> had bin led vnto Priſon, &amp; from thence vnto Death, he was giuen to vnderſtand, how hee was pardoned, and the Marriage conſummated. If his ſorrow were great it may be knowne by the effects, ſeeing it is now Twenty yeares ſince, from theſe <hi>Pirenean</hi> mountaines which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide <hi>France</hi> from <hi>Spaine,</hi> hee hath liued as an out Lawe, robbed, pilled, and ruyned all that hee findes, neither Kingdomes being able to take any reuenge. Hee was One and twenty yeares olde when hee came from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fricke,</hi> hee is now Forty one: a ſtrong man, Vigorious of his perſon, which is much fortified by his auſtere and wilde life. And that may be beleeued of him, which was ſaid of <hi>Hercules,</hi> that without doubt hee had three liues, for if he had had but one, it had bin a miracle that he had not loſt it by ſo many wounds.</p>
               <p>This day about Sun riſing hee came downe to ſee what noyſe this was, which the night before had ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the Sea vnto the Woods, and hee with about ten of vs which followed him hauing found ſome bords which the ſea had caſt vp, vpon one of which was
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:14312:10"/>
ſeated a Youngman in habite of a Pilgrim like thy ſelfe, pale, in a trance, all drencht in water, his hayres full of dirt and ſand, and to conclude, euill accommodated with this tempeſt, hee commanded vs to carry him to that place where the reſt of his men were, and aſwell to dry him as to get him breath, which he had almoſt loſt, we indeauored to vncloath him, but he refuſing to bee ſeene or to be touched by vs, It made our Captaine ſuſpect that he was not a man, for although he inforced himſelf to appeare ſo, yet his actions ſhewed the cleane contrary; when as preuenting the deſire which the Captaine had to be cleared of his ſexe, this Pilgrim of whom I tell thee (taking him aſide) confeſſed that ſhe was a Woman, who came in this habit from <hi>Italy,</hi> with her husband; in which voyage, they had ſuffered Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke vpon this ſhore: And in ſaying this, ſhame and deſire to defend herſelfe, brought colour into her face, and valour into her heart; with one, ſhe appeared per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly faire, and with the other extreamly hardy: Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe her beauty being more powerfull to hurt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, then her forces to defend herſelfe, hath vanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Doricles</hi> his minde, who with ſweet and curteous wordes perſwaded her to reſt this day in his company, during which time her face hath neuer beene without teares. In the meane time hee commanded, after Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetting, that his ſupper and his bed ſhould be prouided in one of thoſe Villages, But wee inſtantly heard that ſome charge of money which was to bee carryed to <hi>Genoa,</hi> ſhould come this way, and hauing waighted for them vntill midnight, wee were without both ſupper and lodging: for this cauſe we ſent two of our compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:14312:10"/>
before, who are they which found you together with him, who conducted vs hether; <hi>Doricles</hi> hee is now with this Pilgrim; I cannot tell thee whether hee hath gained her or no, nor whether the bed had made a peace betweene two mindes ſo abſolutely differing: but certaine it is that they are now lodged together.</p>
               <p>The Soldiours did eaſily perceiue that the Pilgrim hearing this ſtory, bathed his face with his teares, and with ſad and violent ſighings endeauoured to pierce heauen: They deſiring the cauſe, hee remaining a long time ſilent, and they ſtill preſſing him; In the end hee began to cry out; Oh miſerable, wretch, that I am, I haue loſt my honour, my glory is deſtroyed, my hope is dead, by the hands and weaknes of a Woman. O that euer the Sea pardoned my life, ſince that with ſo much pitty, it reſerued thine, to the end that my eyes might be witneſſes (after ſo many labors and dangers) of ſuch an offence. Well did the Soldiers know that this was the man whom the Pilgrim reſpected, and the true North ſtarre vnto which ſhee turned the needle of her affection: but they endeauouring to comfort him, ſo much increaſed his fury, that drawing forth his ſword out of his Pilgrims ſtaffe, the out ſide whereof ſerued as a ſcaberd, hee ranne inraged out of this houſe vnto the houſe where the Captaine lay, and there gaue ſuch blowes vpon the doore, and ſuch loude cryes, that the Captaine thinking, he had bin aſſayled by the Iuſtice or by the Inhabitants of that place, leaped out of his bed in his ſhirt, his Piſtoll in his hand, and opening the doore asked who was there? A wretched man, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Pilgrim with an incredible fiercenes, and one
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:14312:11"/>
from whom thou haſt taken his honour, with this vile woman which thou doeſt poſſeſſe. <hi>Doricles</hi> diſcharged his Piſtoll and the Pilgrim turning his body, the bullet light in his arme. All the company ran thether at the noyſe, and the valiant <hi>Catalonian</hi> diſpoſed himſelfe to ſtrike quicker then the Lightning came out of thunder ſent by <hi>Ioue</hi> againſt the Giants, when as the miſerable Pilgrim woman, imbracing him with prayers, begged the Pilgrims life, ſaying vnto <hi>Doricles,</hi> that this man was hee whom ſhe did onely acknowledge for her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and on the other ſide aſſuring her deſperate Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band that ſhe had not tranſgreſſed againſt her honour, neither in deed, word nor thought; becauſe his prayers had not vanquiſhed her, and his threats ſhould neuer. I doe not know if it ought to bee beleeued of a woman: the Hiſtory commendeth her Chaſtity, and I doe reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly beleeue the vertue of this ſexe ſo much eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by me, and ſo greatly had in accompt all my life. <hi>Doricles</hi> would willingly that the Pilgrim ſhould haue bin contented with his life, which he would leaue him, and that hee ſhould haue gone away without the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, But the incenſed <hi>Caſtillian</hi> defying him to a ſingle combate, began to defame him, and prouoke him in ſuch manner, that he commanded his Soldiers to hang him vp at the next Tree of the mountaine: hardly was the word out of the Captaines mouth, when the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim ſawe himſelfe carryed out of the Village by theſe barbarious fellowes, and vpon his way towards the Wood where hee ſhould be branched vp, Seeing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe then at the place of execution and in the preſence of an vncuitable death, hee intreated them with teares,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:14312:11"/>
that they would let him recommend his ſoule to him that was the author thereof; which being permitted vnto him, hee drew out of his boſome an Image of the bleſſed Virgin; which holding vp, with his eyes and his hands to heauen, he began his prayers deuoutly, hauing the match of one of their peeces about his necke neere vnto him, who tyed it to a bough of a great Oake, onely wayting for the end of his deuotions: Neuertheleſſe euen as hee faſtened the laſt knot, the faire morning re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing the world with new light, cleerly diſcouered the amiable colour of his face.</p>
               <p>Who will beleeue that in the ſpace of one night ſo many fortunes ſhould happen to one man, if it were not knowne that things are written to bee marked, and that euils doe ſeldome come alone, ſeeing that the euils which happen in one night to one vnfortunate man, doe ſurpaſſe all the proſperity which can happen to a fortunate man in all his life? The Soldiers ſeeing the honeſt &amp; graue countenance of this Pilgrim, his youth and his Innocency, and being otherwayes molified with his prayers; or hauing their hearts ſecretly tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched by the handes of God, for hee who hardned <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ros</hi> heart can moliſie others, they reſolued to let him liue, not willing to bee more cruell then the Sea, which the day before had caſt him vpon Land from drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; and thinking it was an infamous cruelty, that hee who had been ſpared by thinges without ſence, ſhould bee deſtroyed by them who ought to haue reaſon. The Pilgrim giueth them thankes for their liberality, and referring their reward vnto heauen, intreateth them that if by chance, this Woman which hee had left, did
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:14312:12"/>
perſeuer in the firmnes of her ſpeech, they ſhould tell her that ſhe ſhould finde him at <hi>Barcelon:</hi> This ſaid, he tooke his way towards the Citty, and the Soldiers to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Village. But the fained newes of his Death which they were conſtrained to deliuer vnto <hi>Doricles,</hi> ſo much depriued the ſorowfull Pilgrim woman of ſence (whom he had before thruſt out of his Chamber, being vexed with her cryes) that ſhee remained a long time as dead, and when as ſhe was come againe vnto her ſelfe, ſhe did and ſaid ſo many pittifull thinges, that theſe fierce men moſt accuſtomed to ſhed blood, did now ſhed teares. So that the Captaine deſpairing of euer being able to pacifie her; and thinking that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of extreame griefe doe eaſily paſſe to a frenzy, commanded, that ſhe ſhould be caryed vpon the great high way; where the miſerable woman was left, drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning her ſelfe in teares, and murdering her face with her hands, ſhe made herſelfe looke with great deformity: from thence following the way by the Sea ſide ſhee went to <hi>Valence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Pilgrim in the meane time was at <hi>Barcelon,</hi> where hauing ſtayed two dayes, to view the goodly ſtrong walles of the Citty; the third day as he was beholding the Viceroyes Pallace, this Fiſher, whoſe voyce had ſo vnhappily drawne him from the Cabens of the other Fiſhermen, and as a deceitfull <hi>Hiena</hi> had called him to bring his life into ſuch danger, knew him, and deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of him if hee were not the Theefe, which entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him the other night with wordes, vntill his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions came and entering by force into the houſes of the Village, had robbed them and pilled them? It is
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:14312:12"/>
true anſwered the Pilgrim, that I am hee who by the ſound of thy voyce came out of the Cabens of men of thy profeſſion, but not he who came with the robbers which you ſpeake of: vpon this they conteſted one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the other, inſomuch that the people runne to the <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>oyſe; And as to bee purſued with hue and cry, there needs no more cauſe but to bee a ſtranger, ſo all the world beleeuing in the naturall <hi>Catalonians</hi> words, the poore Pilgrim was impetuouſly carryed away, by the people, and as a robber put into Priſon.</p>
               <p>The infamous rable who for crimes great or ſmall are accuſtomed to poſſeſſe theſe places, which are like ſo many true repreſentations of Hell: put him into a dark corner worſe then the worſt ſink of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where it is impoſſible to recite the blowes they gaue him, and the iniuries they ſaid vnto him: becauſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no mettall about him, but the Bullet, which <hi>Dori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> ſhot into him the night of his misfortune, hee had not wherewith to pay his garniſh or entrance, nor abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to finde better meanes to appeaſe them.</p>
               <p>Night victorious ouer humane cares, impoſing reſt vnto their labours and their thoughts, and reducing their actions to a deepe ſilence came, amongſt theſe barbarous people, and the miſerable ſtranger onely not ſo much as cloſing his eyes: hee felt not the griefe of his wound, not the infamy of his impriſonment, all that which troubled him, and all that which he feared, was the Pilgrim womans looſing of her honour, which wrought ſo with him, that whilſt others ſlept in this confuſion, without that the want of beds, the importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of many noyſome creatures, which runne vp and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:14312:13"/>
downe in the Priſon, the feare of Iudgement to come, nor the preſent misfortune could wake them; our Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim onely is awake, complaining againſt Heauen, the Sea, and his cruel fortune which had preſerued his life, then, when hee had no feeling of death, to make him ſuffer it now in a ſtate ſo ſenſible.</p>
               <p>At the length the Sunne with a countenance full of ſhame and as if he had bin conſtrained, ſhined through the thicke barres of this Priſon windowes, ſhewing in the pale colour of his beames, that hee feared he ſhould bee ſtayed there, when the pleaſant blowes of the Iay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, and the ſweet noyſe which his Keyes made in the ſtrong lockes, awaked from their forgetfulnes, thoſe vnto whom the feare of puniſhment for their faults could worke no remembrance: But the Pilgrim was not waked, becauſe hee was not aſleepe; he came out amongſt the reſt neuertheleſſe to giue thankes to the day, for hauing paſſed ouer ſo miſerable a night. There began this miſerable body to mooue his parts, going many leagues in a little ſpace: prayers importuned ſome, care wearyed others; neceſſity called out heere, hunger ſighed there, and Liberty was wiſhed for euery where: The Lawes called vpon execution, Miniſters vpon puniſhment, and fauour importuned for delay; thoſe who had wherewith went out by the ayre, others not hauing wherewith could not finde the Doore; the confuſion of voyces, the vnquietnes of the Iudge, the comming in of ſome, the going out of others, and the noyſe of Fetters, made in this diſcording inſtrument a fearefull ſtriuing.</p>
               <p>In this time, a Knight; who for the noblenes of his
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:14312:13"/>
blood, and the antiquity of his Impriſonment, was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally reſpected as the Maſter, caſt his eyes vpon the Pilgrim, and conſidering his deepe melancholy, his habite, &amp; his perſon, incited by his good countenance and aſpect, (for there is no letter of fauour which wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth greater effects in all neceſſities) called him to a little alley which anſwered to the doore of his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and asked his name, his Countrey, and the cauſe of his impriſonment? The Pilgrim recited vnto him the ſucceſſe which you haue heard, beginning his life, from the time that the Sea gaue it him, by caſting him vpon the ſhore not farre from the walles of <hi>Barcelon.</hi> The Knight wondred at it, and collecting from his reaſons, and the manner of his ſpeech, his vnderſtanding and his gentlenes, tooke ſuch affection vnto him, that hee pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him in his Chamber: where hauing reſtored his weake forces, with Conſerues which he had, hee made him diſcouer his Arme, and he himſelfe healed the wound with medicines and wordes, which he had lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned being a Soldier; for if Herbes and ſtones haue this vertue, wherefore ſhould it be wanting to holy words?</p>

               <head>The Hiſtory of Mireno.</head>
               <p>IN a little Towne not farre from this great Citty, there was a Gentleman named <hi>Telemaquus</hi> marryed with a faire Lady, not ſo chaſt as the Roman <hi>Lucrece</hi> although ſhee caryed her name; the report was, that this Marriage was made againſt her minde, &amp; it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be true, as by the effects it was afterwards witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: her melancholy increaſed, her beauty and clothes neglected, did ſhew a languiſhment, like Roſes, when the radicall moyſture of their boughes doe decreaſe. <hi>Telemaquus</hi> did inforce himſelfe to diuert her from this
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:14312:15"/>
ſad kinde of neglect, leaſt it might ſeeme vnto ſome which ſhould ſee her, that this ſadnes proceeded from his default, for oftentimes innocent Husbands are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed for their wiues euill conditions. He apparelled her richly, carried her to ſolace and recreate her ſelfe to Sea, and to ſee the choiſeſt Gardens. And this being not ſufficient hee opened his houſe to all good compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Amongſt the young Knights which did ordinarily frequent and conuerſe with them, there was one called <hi>Mireno,</hi> ſo much my friend, that if Death had not ſet a difference between vs, I could not haue bin perſwaded (he being aliue) to diſcerne which of vs two had bin my ſelfe. This man caſt his eyes (vntill this time buſied in the conſideration of anothers beauty) vpon <hi>Telemachuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> faire wife; who looking vpon him more earneſtly then vpon any other, had (it may bee) incited him: for although it bee ſaid that Loue can pierce as a Spirit, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the moſt cloſe and ſecret places: Yet I doe thinke it impoſſible, that any man ſhould Loue, if he bee not at the firſt obliged thereunto by ſome little hope. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed from me the beginning of his thought: for loue is alwayes borne diſcreet, and dumbe as a Childe. But the ſame ſweetnes of its conuerſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth ſo quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly teach it to ſpeake, that like a Priſoner at the Barre he oftentimes caſteth himſelfe away by his owne tongue. So after hee ſaw himſelfe admitted in <hi>Lucrece</hi> her eyes (an euident index that he was already in her ſoule) not being able to ſuffer the glory of that whereof hee eaſily indured the paine; hee made vnto me a great diſcourſe of his Fortune, or to ſay truer, of his folly; which could not haue bin hurtfull vnto him, if hee had followed my
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:14312:15"/>
aduiſe aſwell as he asked it. But it is ordinary, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with thoſe who are in Loue, to aske counſell, then when as for nothing in the world they would forbeare<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to doe that which they haue in their minde. I left no Hiſtory, either diuine, or humane, which was within my knowledge and to purpoſe, that I did not lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, exagerating the euils, which did proceede from like enterpriſes. But <hi>Mireno</hi> who had already firmely determined to follow his purpoſe, and thinking that I was not apt for his deſigne, by litle &amp; litle, forbare to viſit me. Quickly did he forbeare to accompany me in walking: wee went no more by day to publicke con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſations, nor by night to priuate; A notable error in the condition of men, whoſe loues and friendſhips are kept by flattery, and loſt by truth. I did beare <hi>Mireno's</hi> abſence with great impatience, and hee had no feeling of his liuing without me; becauſe <hi>Lucrece</hi> being now his whole ſoule, could not ſuffer that hee ſhould haue another <hi>Mireno:</hi> hauing thus ſhaken me off, communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cateth his buſines with a third, who was ſo common a friend vnto vs both, that when I wanted <hi>Mireno,</hi> or <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reno</hi> wanted me, we did ſeeke one the other at his houſe: This man was not ſo conſiderate as I was, contrariwiſe there was no kinde of danger, into which he would not precipitate himſelfe to pleaſure his friend; ſuch friends are like powder in Feſtiuall dayes, which to reioyce o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſpendeth it ſelfe. This made me diſguiſe my ſelfe to follow them in the night; and one time aboue the reſt, when I had more patience, and they leſſe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration then ordinary, I ſawe how they ſet a Ladder to a window of a Tower, which diſcouered a ſpacious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:14312:16"/>
into the Sea, ouer a Garden of <hi>Telemaquus:</hi> I ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the end not to be anſwered what they did, but to ſee if I could ſerue in any ſtead in the importance of this danger, and my heart did not deceiue me, although <hi>Mireno</hi> who was within it did deceiue me. For after the firſt ſleepe, then when as with leſſe force hee van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſheth the cares of a maſter of a family, I heard a noyſe, and preſently I ſawe <hi>Mireno</hi> comming downe a Ladder, and <hi>Aurelio</hi> (for ſo was he called with whome he was accompanied) receiuing him in his armes, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded him to flye: hardly were they out of the ſtreet, when as a ſeruant looſing the Ladder let it fall, I runne to the fall thereof, and aſwell as I could gathering it vp, ſtepped behind a corner, from whence I eſpied <hi>Telema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quus</hi> in his ſhirt, hauing his Sword naked in one hand, and a Candle in the other: and looking out at the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe of the Tower if he could diſcerne any thing vpon the ground, of that which he had heard: I crept ſoftly to the gate; and harkening what was ſaid in this family where there was this alaram, I vnderſtood that the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace of our two Louers, was taken to bee the induſtry of Robbers. In this they were not deceiued, for thoſe are no ſmal theeues, who ſteale good name &amp; rob away honour: I returned much contented to my houſe, and ſlept but euill, in this care: The morning being come I ſent for <hi>Mireno,</hi> with whom hauing diſcourſed of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers matters, I asked what newes of <hi>Lucrece?</hi> hee tolde me he did not ſpeake with her: For all wicked ſecrets doe for the moſt part conceale themſelues from true friends. I ſaid then vnto him, that I wondred he would diſſemble a thing ſo knowne; <hi>Telemaquus</hi> her Husband
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:14312:16"/>
being come vnto my houſe, to tell me that he had heard him within his; that looking out of a windowe of a Tower, he had ſeene him goe downe by a Ladder: <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reno</hi> aſtoniſhed and wondring at my relation, confeſſed vnto me what had paſſed, and how <hi>Lucrece</hi> hauing yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnto his Letters, meſſages, and ſeruices had made him maſter of her liberty, yeelding vnto him the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure which was ſo euill kept by <hi>Telemaquus</hi> his hundred eyes. Which was the cauſe why I placed this Hirogli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique of <hi>Argus</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> with this ſaying of <hi>Stroſſa:</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>Subtle loue deceiueth Iealouſie.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Hee proceeded to tell me that when <hi>Telemaquus</hi> was aſleepe, they talked together in a Garden, into which hee entred by a Ladder made of cordes, which <hi>Aurelio</hi> kept, vnto whome onely hee had imparted this ſecret, hauing found me ſo auerſe from ſuccouring him. I asked what hee had done with the ladder? hee tolde me that from the leauing of that, procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Telemaquuſſes</hi> aduertiſement. The letting him ſee it, I tolde him that <hi>Telemaquus</hi> knew nothing, neither had the Ladder ſerued as an occaſion to diſcouer any thing vnto him: And letting him ſee the ſeruice which I had done him, I did begin to coniure him, that hee would in theſe terms leaue, the perilous ſucceſſe which hee ought to expect from the purſute of this deſigne, ſeeing that <hi>Telemaquus</hi> at the leaſt had notice, that his Wife was not by his ſide when there was noyſe in the Lodging: So that hee promiſed me, he would not goe any more thether, and the more to diuert him from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thether, hee reſolued to abſent himſelfe from <hi>Barce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon.</hi> I confirmed him in this reſolution; becauſe that

truely there is nothing which ſo much ecclipſeth the deſire of Louers, as an interpoſed diſtance of place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them; yet it was not needfull, becauſe by that time <hi>Mireno</hi> diſpoſed himſelfe to depart, <hi>Telemaquus</hi> already changed his dwelling from this Citty vnto the little place where he was marryed; And this was a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable obſeruation, <hi>Mireno</hi> looſing the ordinary view of his <hi>Lucrece,</hi> loſt her alſo out of his thought, and confirmed his Loue better then euer to <hi>Eriſila,</hi> (ſhee was that other Lady whom I in the beginning of my diſcourſe I ſaid hee had loued) who againe loued him better and with more pleaſure then before, becauſe that Loue, which ſucceedeth after iealouſie is more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent, beſides the amiable parts which were in <hi>Mireno,</hi> who was of a goodly ſtature, of great ſpirit, and an illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious blood, of a free condition, amiable both a horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe, and a foot, and renowned beyond all of his age, for all Military exerciſe; As for his face behold this Picture, wherein I aſſure you, the Painter was no flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer; I keepe it heere for my comfort, although it bee alwayes preſent in my ſoule, as you may iudge by theſe wordes following:

Becauſe that truely his image did neuer abandon my ſight, but either ſleeping or waking he was repreſented to my eyes: In effect we fell into our olde imwardnes; but in the midſt of this peace, the loue of <hi>Telemaquus</hi> had ſo much power ouer him, that vanquiſhed with his wiues Prayers, he brought her againe to <hi>Barcelon,</hi> where ſhe was no ſooner ſeene by <hi>Mireno,</hi> but the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent flames of his loue, blowing away the aſhes into the

They then began to ſee one the other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, for in theſe good workes, mediators are ſildome wanting: <hi>Eriſila</hi> who was paſſionatly in loue with <hi>Mt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reno,</hi> began to diſcerne in him a coldenes and a careleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in ſeing her, &amp; that he did diuert himſelfe by other pleaſures; She (in this ſuſpition, which may be called a true iealouſie) began to obſerue &amp; folowe him; ſo that without ſpoyling much, ſhe knew, if not all that paſſed, at the leaſt what was the ſubiect which rauiſhed away her <hi>Mireno.</hi>

viewing <hi>Eriſila,</hi> hee ſawe in her a braue diſpoſition of a woman, who looked vpon him with faire and ſweete eyes; for when they will deceiue, they make their eyes ſnares, and their ſweetneſſes baytes: <hi>Telemaquus</hi> yeilded himſelfe (although he loued <hi>Lucrece)</hi> forced by the eyes and beauty of <hi>Eriſila,</hi> which did ſo much the more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke him, by how much ſhe deſired to deceiue him: he began to come to her Houſe, and ſhe to feigne a great deale of paſſion, <hi>Mireno</hi> giuing them leyſure inough, in regard he did not frequent her houſe as he was accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed: Finally their affection came to the point that <hi>Eriſila</hi> deſired.

                  <hi>Telemaquus</hi> ſmiling, began to appeaſe her ſaying, that it was without any deſigne that he had entred into this houſe (whereof indeed he was Maſter:) and as ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to witnes a more feeling ſorowe, accompanied with falſe teares; he beg<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

And ſome are of opinion, that ſelfe-commending is not vnbeſeming, when it importeth the good opinion of an other man. <hi>Eriſila</hi> then finding a good occaſion for her wicked de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, tolde him, that <hi>Lucrece</hi> husband might bee a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant man, Yet neuertheleſſe, ſhe knew that <hi>Lucrece</hi> did not forbeare, to make Loue vnto a Knight of the Citty; and ſhe was afraid that ſhee might as well loue him as the other: becauſe what woman ſoeuer ſhe bee, ſhe
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:14312:18"/>
doth eaſily ſuffer her ſelfe to bee wonne, after the firſt lightnes: <hi>Telemaquus</hi> who began to waxe ſo pale that it was eaſie to be knowne in his face, what intereſt hee had in this diſcourſe; intreated her to diſcouer who was this Knight: But ſhee feigning to be iealouſe of him, whom ſhe did indeauour to make ſo iealouſe, inforceth her complaints, perſwading him, that ſhe was troubled with that iealouſie, which indeed ſhe had raiſed in him. To be ſhort, <hi>Eriſila</hi> vnwilling to name who it was; <hi>Tele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maquus</hi> ſodainly ſtepped to her, and drawing his Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, ſetting it to her throat made her vtter the name of <hi>Mireno,</hi> a perſon whom he knew better then ſhee: with this <hi>Telemaquus</hi> went away, confeſſing it was true that hee had loued <hi>Lucrece,</hi> not knowing ſhe had another Louer; but now from this tiem forward he would hate her, and would ſettle all his affection vpon her, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of which, he gaue her a chaine of golde, and a Diamond.</p>
               <p>By this meanes, <hi>Eriſila</hi> thought that the Husband would keepe his houſe, and that <hi>Mireno</hi> (by this means barred from ſeeing <hi>Lucrece)</hi> would come to viſite her as he was accuſtomed. But the Knight, whom it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to wipe away this ſpot from his honour by his blood who had offended him, Seeing it was now no longer time to keepe that, which was loſt, feigning a few dayes after to goe to <hi>Montſerrat,</hi> gaue a beginning to his reuenge, and an end vnto my life. The two Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers were not ſuch ſots, nor I ſuch a foole, that wee did not thinke (although wee were ignorant of <hi>Eriſilus</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice) that this abſence might be feyned; hauing had ſo many examples in the world; wherefore wee ſent our
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:14312:19"/>
faithfull friend <hi>Aurelio</hi> ſecretly after him. But the adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Telemaquus,</hi> who knew well that he was not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue fooles, went thether infallibly, whether he ſaid he would, and aſſured vs in ſuch manner, with this truth, that he deceiued vs after at his pleaſure: becauſe that another time, feyning that he went to <hi>Valence,</hi> he retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned when he was halfe way, &amp; hid himſelfe in <hi>Barcelon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now <hi>Mireno</hi> could not ſleepe ſo aſſured with <hi>Lucrece</hi> but that I kept the Doore, although he did intreat mee not to doe it; God knoweth how many nights I paſſed without pleaſure; for my heart did alwayes tell me that their two liues did runne a dangerous Fortune. But <hi>Telemaquus</hi> the third night after entring by a ſecret doore, into the Garden (I ſpake of vnto you) without being heard or ſeene by any perſon, with onely one ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant with him, who carryed a Halberd, came vnto the Chamber where his ſteps were heard, and out of which <hi>Mireno</hi> came to meet him, very euill prouided of armes to defend himſelfe, not that I doubt he would not haue well defended himſelfe, halfe aſleep &amp; naked as he was, with his Sword alone which he had in his hand: If his aduerſary, who was accommodated with more aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageable armes, had not ouerthrowne him dead to the ground with a Harquebuſh ſhot: the report of the peece, made mee iudge that ſuch a ſalutation at that time of the night, was rather a condemnation, then any thing elſe: wherefore indeauouring to breake open the doores, I waked the neighbors, ſome of whom running thether with their armes, and hauing helped me to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow the doores, wee entred in.

and dragging her from thence, not farre from the place where <hi>Mireno</hi> lay, hee thruſt his ſword into her, ſo that when we came, her breath went away with the laſt <hi>Ieſus.</hi> And ſeeing that he had killed <hi>Mireno,</hi> me thought <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligers</hi> verſe, which is vnder this picture was not vnapt:

               <p>I had not as yet ſeene <hi>Mireno,</hi> and ſearching him with mine eyes all about the roome, I ſawe him lying Dead: thou mayſt ſee in the teares which now flowe from my eyes, what was then my griefe, I doe not know what I did, yet ſeeking for <hi>Telemaquus,</hi> I did excuſe him for the care of defending himſelfe; and from iuſtifying ſo bloody an execution: For hauing met face to face, I thruſt at him, with which thruſt, he accompanied their two liues, which he had extinguiſhed. By this time the houſe was beſet, by thoſe whome the Iuſtice had raiſed, who apprehended as many as they found, and me eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, for hauing killed <hi>Telemaquus</hi> without cauſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though according to the Lawes of the world there was but too much cauſe, and heere they put me where thou now ſeeſt me, &amp; where I haue liued this fiue yeares, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Death, as thou mayſt ſee by this winged Heart of mine flying after this Image of dead <hi>Mireno;</hi> with this word out of <hi>Virgill:</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Y a ſtraight way, between thicke Trees and ſhady did the Pilgrim goe towards <hi>Mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerrat,</hi> who turning his head at a noyſe which hee heard behinde at his backe, hee ſawe two young-men with Palmers ſtaues, whoſe faire faces, and white hayre made them ſhew to bee either <hi>Germans</hi> or <hi>Flemmings,</hi> He ſaluted them, and ioyfull of ſo good company, he impoſed ſilence vnto a thouſand ſad thoughts, which ſolitarines had brought into his memory; And trauelling together, they began to diſcourſe of diuers matters, with which they eaſily and with pleaſure paſſed away the craggy, and vneuen way of the mountaine, vntill they came vnto a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, which bubling into a valley, made a gentle har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; So that as it were inuited by the ſweet noyſe, and the freſh ſhade, they ſate downe vpon the ruſhes
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:14312:21"/>
which grew by the Brooke ſide, and admiring the ſweet complaints of the Nightingale; one of the <hi>Almans,</hi> which ſhewed a good nature imbelliſhed with Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, began to diſcourſe of <hi>Filomelas</hi> loue, ſaying that now ſhe wold recompence with her infinit notes, all the time that ſhe had bin dumbe after <hi>Terreus</hi> had cut out her tongue. The <hi>Spaniard,</hi> replyed that <hi>Martiall,</hi> had vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the ſame conceit, &amp; the <hi>Alman</hi> reioycing to finde in him more capacity then in common perſons (for it is an inſupportable labour to trauell with an ignorant man) riſe from the place where he ſate, and imbracing him with a great deale of contentment, after many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſcourſes, Let vs goe, ſaid hee, adore the bleſſed Virgin. In this Image ſo much renowned, through all the world, wee cannot make a more holy voyage, nor I in better company then thine: let vs goe ſaid the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard by this pathe, which ſeemeth to me to bee much the ſhorter, although a little ſteeper, for the moſt part of the way.</p>
            <p>This being ſaid, they tooke their way towards the Temple, which they diſcouered ſhortly after, built vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſide of a ſharpe Mountaine, and vnder a great Rocke, which did ſeeme to threaten it with ruyne.</p>
            <p>When they were entred, with deuotion &amp; humility, caſting their eyes into this Tapeſtry of <hi>France, Almane,</hi> and almoſt all the world: they were aſtoniſhed, to ſee the walls decked with ſo many excellent Paintings, Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories, &amp; accompanied with a thouſand ſeuerall kinds of offerings, which with an admirable correſpondency did ſtirre vp and aſtoniſh the ſences altogether.

               </head>
               <p>AMongſt all the thinges, which in the courſe of my life I haue ſeene and marked, I might peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture tell you ſome one, which might better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent you. But thinking that one cannot better per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade, then by the example of himſelfe; I will therefore tell you a ſtory which is drawen from my youth, and from the Twentith yeare of my age, written by my miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, and imprinted in my memory, ſeeing that the renuing can doe me no damage, and may bring you profit. This ſhort tyrannie, the bayte of youth, the illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the ſight, the priſon of the ſoule, and the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the ſence, which is called Beauty, and which hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſeemeth to giue Women for our miſchiefe: blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:14312:22"/>
ſo my eyes at the firſt knowledge, which they had in the world, that my ſpirit did not liue ſo much in my ſelfe, as in her whom I loued, nor found more reſt out of her ſight, then thinges doe out of their centure; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that as the fire alwayes ſendeth the flames thereof to its proper ſphaere, ſo my heart adreſſed his deſires to her beauty.</p>
               <p>Now as this Loue was not <hi>Platoniqe.</hi> I will not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute whether it were honeſt, profitable, or delightfull; Let it ſatisfie, that it, which is the cauſe of ſo much euil, ſeemed vnto me, the greateſt and ſoueraigneſt good in the world. This ſubiect of my misfortunes, was called <hi>Aurelia,</hi> free in her cuſtomes, of that kinde of life, which <hi>Plautus &amp; Terence</hi> deſcribe in their Fables; and of whom <hi>Auulus</hi> ſaith excellently well; That a Curtezan is a veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell full of holes, which can containe nothing. She was faire in all perfection, of a quicke and hardy ſpirit, and of a reaſonable good nature, a woman (to be ſhort) vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom experience in the worlde had brought a great deale of knowledge. It coſt me little to poſſeſſe her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that theſe kinde of women (cleane contrary vnto other women, who forced by the Loue of a man, doe honeſtly yeild vnto his merits) truſting to their charms and vnto the gentlenes of vſage, paſſionate men more when they are inioyed, then when they are pretended. I was not vexed at the firſt, with the conuerſation of young men, who at any hower how extraordinary ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, were neuer wanting in her houſe, becauſe the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours which ſhe did me, and the little which they coſt me, made me liue much contented, eſpecially ſeeing my ſelfe preferred before others, of better meanes and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:14312:22"/>
merits then my ſelfe; when I went to ſee her, they gaue me place, and departed curteouſly, leauing me alone with her.</p>
               <p>Theſe my viſitations were not agreable vnto her ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, becauſe they thought, that thereby, this rable of youth was ſcattered, which brought them profit. And that if <hi>Aurelia</hi> ſhould fall in Loue with me; my quality being not capable to ſuſtaine her expence, ſhee muſt ſpend out of her owne meanes, from whence would vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euitably follow a neceſſity of liuing more regularly, which they would by no meanes heare of; And of this were they not much deceiued, for in a ſmall time <hi>Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> who had rauiſhed ſo many others, was taken her ſelfe in my loue, and made captiue to my will, which made true one part of this feare, and ſhortned the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues of her houſe, to lengthen the reynes of her plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Not that all the charge of the houſe, fell vpon her; for I miſerable man, tormenting my Parents, and importuning my friends, did runne to the preſeruation of this loue, which almoſt alwayes depended of mony.</p>
               <p>The life which wee led (wee louing one another ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, and hauing in our power the liberty of inioying) may eaſily bee iudged by my youth, and by <hi>Aurelia<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s,</hi> who was then about 20. yeares olde. The houſe ſeemed too ſtraight for our Loue, and ſearching ſolitary fields, we made the ſight of open heauen witnes of our folies, our life was a blind imitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the nature of Beaſts, we communicated our ſecrets to Trees, which did not ſee, as if the leaues had not beene ſo many cleare eyes, and a thouſand amorous delights to the dumbe Fountaines, which might well haue troubled the purity of their
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:14312:23"/>
waters, I cannot thinke how in ſo little a way as there was between my houſe, &amp; hers. I remained 5 yeres ſpace before I knew that I was arriued there, being certaine, that in 3. yeares ſpace of that time, the famous Engliſh <hi>Drake</hi> paſſed the ſtraight of <hi>Magellan,</hi> &amp; compaſſed the world about. If in all this time, the loyalty which ſhee ſwore vnto me, were broken or no, I am not able to ſay, nor yet forbeare to beleeue, becauſe it ſeemes almoſt a thing vnpoſſible, for ſuch women from their cuſtome, to keepe themſelues to an orderly life.</p>
               <p>At the end of theſe fiue yeares, I ſaw my ſelfe at the end of my meanes, and although I was more amorous then in the beginning, yet <hi>Aurelia</hi> did ſuffer herſelfe to be vanquiſhed by the obligations of another, who had more power, then my ſeruices: I ſay obligations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I cannot beleeue, that onely Loue can binde one vnto ſo ſtrange a change. One night <hi>Aurelia</hi> hauing ſeene me retire my ſelfe vnto my bed, ſhee had receiued <hi>Feliciano</hi> into hers (ſo was the Knight called.) I ſtirred with a profound Iealouſie, riſe vp out of my bed, and went to her houſe, where the doore was ſhut againſt me: and the ſeruants anſwered mee from aboue out at an high windowe, feyning that they were gone to bed, to make me rather to retire vnto my owne houſe. But my extreame loue which would not at that time, haue relyed vpon my eyes, and feared to be betrayed by my thoughts: made me cry aloude, that ſome body ſhould open the doore, ſo that my voyce came vnto <hi>Aurelia's</hi> eares. And <hi>Feliciano</hi> making ſhew of a valiant-Louer, began to cloth himſelf, promiſing to chaſtice my bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes with his Sword, and by his onely preſence to cure
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:14312:23"/>
my folly; But the cunning <hi>Circe,</hi> who knew well what good or bad ſucceſſe ſoeuer came vnto mee, it would redound vnto her ſhame; hindred him with her armes, and diuerted him with her teares, although there was no great neede: For the braueſt doe vnwillingly arme themſelues, when they are once naked; and to come out of a houſe into the ſtreet, had beene a manifeſt and mad raſhnes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aurelia</hi> ſo preuailing, in that manner, wherein others of her kinde are wont to preuaile; and making <hi>Feliciano</hi> beleeue, that I ſhould be her husband, and that if I did perceiue him, ſhee ſhould looſe me; perſwaded him halfe vnclothed, and in the midſt of Ianuary, that hee would goe into the higheſt roofe of the houſe. Into which he being gone, I was let into the houſe, where I found <hi>Aurelia</hi> in bed making ſo many complaints of my liberty, and of the ſcandall which I gaue the neighbors, that in ſtead of being angry, it behoued me to appeaſe her, where (after ſome time ſpent) ſhe in complaining of me, and I in asking pardon for my iealouſie, and for the deſire which I had to ſurpriſe her in that infidelity which I did diſtruſt: I poſſeſt the abſent mans place, which was ſtill warme, ſeruing for a proofe of my igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and blockiſhnes.</p>
               <p>Morning brought againe the Sunne, and the Sun the Day, yet neither of them was ſufficient to make me ſee my folly (ſo euill doth a Louer diſcerne of his owne acts) I riſe contented, and although I entred laſt, yet I went ſooner away then <hi>Feliciano.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the meane time <hi>Menander</hi> who had for the ſpace of ſome yeares, been <hi>Feliciano's</hi> Miſtris, grew extreamly
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:14312:24"/>
iealous, and hearing of this trick, which <hi>Aurelia</hi> had put vpon him, could not forbeare ſpeaking of it, mocking him with the colde night which he had indured, &amp; that hee had ſuffered me, who neuer had any intent to marry her, to poſſeſſe that place by her ſide which he had loſt: <hi>Feliciano</hi> aſſured her, that <hi>Aurelia</hi> (preferring his Loue, before the obligations, wherein for ſo many yeares ſhe was bound vnto me) did rather abuſe me then him; and that whenſoeuer ſhee or any other, would afford him the like curteſie, hee would willingly ſuffer one euill night, to haue ſo many good: and for proofe of what he ſaid, he gaue her a key, wherof I was wont to be maſter, which I was made beleeue was loſt. <hi>Menander</hi> diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled her thoughts, but ſo ſoone as ſhee met me againe, ſhee tolde me all the circumſtances, and with all gaue me the Key; hauing which, I needed no other witneſſes of the truth, nor other inſtrument to open the doore. I then reſolued to reuenge my ſelfe of <hi>Aurelia</hi> in leauing her, and of <hi>Feliciano,</hi> in ſeruing <hi>Menander,</hi> from whoſe Loue I preſumed he had not freed himſelfe, and if hee had bin free, yet I knew he muſt needs be grieued, that I ſhould inioy her whom hee loued in euery bodyes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion. I found <hi>Menander</hi> willingly diſpoſed, for our thoughts were alike, and our iniury alike, and we might well ſerue to reuenge one the other; She then feyned to loue me, and I payed her in the like counterfeiting. <hi>Aurelia</hi> was aduertiſed, and grew deſperate, and <hi>Felicia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> no leſſe intaged, ſought me to kill me. Behold how iealouſies and neglects doe diſcouer the truthes, which are in the centure of hearts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aurelia</hi> found me ſooner then <hi>Feliciano</hi> did, as ſhee
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:14312:24"/>
who therein hazerded leaſt: and ſtaying me began in fury and in threatnings, yet ended in prayers and in teares: But vpon ſo freſh an iniury, I was rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in my neglect (ſeeing her yeeld vnto my loue) then any way moued with her paſſion. Finally, hauing changed my firſt affection into hatred, (alwayes inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable to a woman who hath beene well beloued) <hi>Aurelia</hi> began to purſue me, and although that the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of my birth and abode, doth not yeeld for greatnes, to aboue two or three in all <hi>Spaine,</hi> yet could not I find any lodging wherein ſhe did not clamor me, any friend whom ſhe did not reuolt from mee, any ſecret which ſhe did not publiſh, nor any danger whereinto ſhe did not endeauour to throwe me; So that oppreſſed with theſe purſuits, and ſeeing my ſelfe reduced to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting her, after a thouſand contrary deliberations, I reſolued to take vpon me a religious habite, and to preuaile by his protection, in whoſe hands and feete God hath imprinted the markes of our reperation. <note place="margin">St. Fran.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But O theſupreme force of a diſpiſed Loue, from the holy Quire of the Temple, from the middeſt of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and Images of the Saints, the teares of <hi>Aurelia</hi> drew me againe; And then I followed her, with more liberty and leſſe ſhame then before, leauing the habite whereof I was not worthy, and neglecting the ſpirituall treaſure, which I did then inioy, to follow the infamous life which I had formerly led, ſo much power hath the capitall enemy of our ſoules. Our loue began freſher then euer, with the generall ſcandall of thoſe who knew vs, the hatred of our Parents, and the deteſtation of all our friends, which within a ſmall time brought mee to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:14312:25"/>
ſuch tearmes, that I thought ſorrow would haue killed me. The infamy wherein wee liued and the feare of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice did oblige vs, to depart the Citty, and feiling that ſmall remainder of goods which wee had left, laden with a number of euils, wee paſſed into <hi>Italy;</hi> from whence, I went (for ſome time) to ſerue the Catholike King in <hi>Flaunders,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Sauoy</hi> in <hi>Piemont,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning alwayes to <hi>Naples</hi> where I had left her. The laſt time I put to Sea with her in my company, (intending after the <hi>Flaunders</hi> warres, to returne into <hi>Spaine)</hi> where in a violent tempeſt, (which heauen for the quiet of our ſoules) ſent vs in the gulph of <hi>Narbone;</hi> in the laſt point of life, and when we were paſt hope of ſcaping, we vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our ſelues to a Religious life, with ſuch earneſtnes of teares, that afterwards the ſtorme ceaſing and wee landing, ſhee entred into the Monaſtery of the <hi>Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> and I vnderwent this habite wherein you now ſee me, where after ſome yeares of approbation this Cell was giuen me.</p>
               <p>Heere <hi>Tirſis</hi> the Hermit of this happy abode ſtayd his diſcourſe, &amp; our Pilgrims iudging that it was too late to paſſe further, being to deſcend neceſſarily into the Lodging, which within this holy Houſe is giuen freely to ſtrangers; they went vnto the Monaſtery, diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing vpon the Hermits relation, determining the next day to goe to the vttermoſt hermitage, which vnder the title of St. <hi>Ierome,</hi> crowneth the head of the Mountaine.</p>
               <p>But the misfortunes of our Pilgrim, which had ſlept for ſome time, began to wake with more violence; for in the houſe where theſe ſtrangers had lodged, there was wanting ſome Iewels, with a Mayd ſeruant of the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:14312:25"/>
houſe, and the <hi>Almains</hi> amongſt others, were purſued by the Iuſtice, although innocent, becauſe it was affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by ſome, that this ſeruant inamored of their beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, had runne away with them.</p>
               <p>All Nations haue their Epithites, which being once receiued by the world can neuer be loſt. The <hi>Scithians</hi> are called cruell, The <hi>Italians</hi> religious, The <hi>French</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, The <hi>Dutch</hi> induſtrious, The <hi>Perſians</hi> faithleſſe, The <hi>Turkes</hi> laſciuious, The <hi>Parthians</hi> curious, The <hi>Burgundi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> fierce, The <hi>Britaines</hi> hardy, The <hi>Egiptians</hi> valiant, The <hi>Loraines</hi> gentle, The <hi>Spaniards</hi> arrogant, and the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains</hi> beautifull. And this was the cauſe for which it was thought, the Mayd being ſeduced by them had run away with them.</p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Almains</hi> were eaſily taken, but the Pilgrim deſperate through his late long impriſonment, which hee had ſuffered in <hi>Barcelon,</hi> and out of the little iuſtice which he as a ſtranger could expect, ſeeing them come vnto him, ſtood vpon his defence, and floriſhing his Palmers ſtaffe, (with which he was very skilfull) leſt two of them lying vpon the ground wounded, and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly freed himſelfe from the hands of the others, who remained aſtoniſhed at his valour.</p>
               <p>Betweene <hi>Tortoſe</hi> and <hi>Caſtillon,</hi> there ſtretcheth forth a great hill, wherewith the Sea of that coſt is bounded, alongſt the the coſt of the vale of <hi>Sago</hi> and of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Valence:</hi> where the Moores of <hi>Argiere</hi> doe land out of their Gallyes, when they are not perceiued by the watch, and hiding themſelues amongſt the hollow places of theſe hilles, doe rob not onely the Fiſhermen, but all ſuch as paſſe that way. And ſometime when they
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:14312:26"/>
are many of them together, they doe rob away whole Villages together; in this vale, they being guided by Renegados, and thoſe betrayed againe by the Moores: There one darke night did the Pilgrim lye (weary with his iourney which he had taken out of the way) obliged thereunto by the feare which he had of purſuite. And being aſleepe after many long and grieuous imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his loſt happines, which he did beleeue to bee ſtill in the hands of <hi>Doricles,</hi> as the roaring of the Sea (the waues whereof breaking againſt the rockes make a horrible noyſe) awaked him. He heard neare vnto him the voyce of ſome <hi>Moores,</hi> who hauing ioyfully ſupped vpon the Land, were talking of their Robberies. Hee who ſleeping vpon the ground in the field, at his wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiug, findeth himſelfe neere vnto a venomous Snake, doth not ſo ſoone looſe his colour, as doth our feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Pilgrim, hearing the <hi>Moores</hi> ſo neare him, whoſe handes he did thinke it impoſſible to ſcape; Yet relying vpon his iudgement in a matter wherein hee thought his force would not preuaile, ſtole from them by gentle ſliding vpon the ground, making his hands performe the office of his feete vntill hee had attained the top of the hill, where finding that the <hi>Moores</hi> had heard him, hee began to cry with a loude voyce; Heere valiant Knights heere, this is our day: behold the <hi>Moores</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, and as a pray in your hands, whom you haue with ſuch paines and diligence endeauored to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take: Hardly had he couragiouſly vttered theſe words, when as the <hi>Moores,</hi> (like Frogs who at the noyſe of paſſengers leape from the bancke ſides, into the quiet waters of the Lakes) ran with all the ſpeed they could
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:14312:26"/>
to the Sea to get aboard their Boate, with which they eaſily got to their Galley.</p>
               <p>Full of admiration was the Pilgrim, to ſee how hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily his reſolution had ſucceded, when from a Tree which was neere vnto him he heard a voyce, which ſaid: Ah Knight helpe me for the mother of Gods ſake. His valiant courage which was neuer aſtoniſhed with any kinde of danger or misfortune, guided by the voyce vnto the tree, where he had heard him, ſawe a man ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereunto, of whom hauing asked his name, hee was anſwered, that he was a <hi>Catalonian</hi> Knight, whome the <hi>Moores</hi> (after they had killed two of his ſeruants) had taken vpon the poaſt way of <hi>Valence.</hi> The Pilgrim ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vnbound him, and both of them departing from the Sea, tooke their way to <hi>Almenare,</hi> and through the Valley beautified with Orenge trees, trauelled towards <hi>Faura.</hi> Already had the morning ſtrewed pearles vpon Flowers, who putting their heades foorth of the boughes, did ſeeme to ſalute the day, when both the diſcourſe, and face of the Knight, did ſhew vnto the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim that this was <hi>Euerard,</hi> he who (when he was priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner at <hi>Barcelon)</hi> had obliged the Pilgrim for his liberty; both their ioyes, their imbracings, &amp; their teares, were as admirable, as the ſucceſſe which you haue heard: Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence is collected, how agreable vnto Heauen is the good which is done vnto ſtrangers; ſignified by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Philoſopher in <hi>Denoalion &amp; Pirra,</hi> who for hauing Lodged <hi>Iupiter,</hi> were made reſtorers of the world; and contrarily, <hi>Diomedes</hi> deuouring his gueſts with his Horſes, hee was in the end himſelfe deuoured by them.</p>
               <p>The Pilgrim demaunded of <hi>Euerard</hi> how hee had
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:14312:27"/>
gotten his liberty, and hee told him that with the helpe of ſome friends, he had broken Priſon, and ſcaped away by the poſt of <hi>Barcelon;</hi> from whence hee might well haue gone for <hi>Italy,</hi> but being vnwilling to bee a run-a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from his owne Countrey, he was reſolued, to goe to the Court, to haue his cauſe iudged, whether he was going with that intention, when hee fell into this Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſcado of the <hi>Moores.</hi> He then demaunded of him, if he knew <hi>Doricles?</hi> and being anſwered that hee was his kinſman, the Pilgrim ſighed many times, without tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the cauſe, although he were much importuned by <hi>Euerard,</hi> vnto whom he onely ſaid, he had a young Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his company who had quited him to follow <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricles; Euerard</hi> who vnderſtood ſomthing of the ſecrets, (ſuſpecting that this was ſome Woman, who had been ſtollen away by the robbers vpon the ſhore of <hi>Barcelon)</hi> aſſured him that hee knew all the ſeruants which <hi>Dori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> had in his houſe, and that there was not one <hi>Caſteli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> amongſt them.</p>
               <p>In ſuch and like wordes, which drew infinite ſighes and teares from the Pilgrim, they arriued at the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Moruiedro,</hi> (where at this day are remaining, the moſt famous workes of the <hi>Roman</hi> greatnes, of any that are in <hi>Spaine)</hi> and from thence they went to the City of <hi>Valence,</hi> entring by the royall Bridge <hi>Turio,</hi> which riuer the <hi>Moores</hi> call <hi>Gandalabiar:</hi> and paſſing by the famous Tower of <hi>Serranos,</hi> they lodged at a Knights houſe, who was friend vnto <hi>Euerard,</hi> and of the Family of the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caderos.</hi> There they remained this night, finiſhing the relation of their fortunes, vntill the Sunne riſing called them from their reſt, eſpecially <hi>Euerard,</hi> who carryed

with a ſtrong deſire of finiſhing his intended iourney, departed with griefe from the company of the Pilgrim, whome he left no leſſe ſorowfull, in this flouriſhing Citty.</p>
               <p>There he ſpent a fewe dayes in beholding the proud buildings wherewith it was imbeliſhed: and in the end he viſited the Hoſpital where mad folkes are with more care and conueniencie looked vnto and kept, then in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Citie in all <hi>Spayne:</hi> There beholding the ſeueral hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of theſe miſerable people, he (I ſay) who lately was likely to haue loſt his owne wittes, ſawe amongſt thoſe who were leaſt mad, ſit downe at the Table, (at which they did altogether eate) a young Foole &amp; very beautifull, whoſe flaxen haire was longer then men doe ordinarily weare in <hi>Spayne;</hi> All the blood in this Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims body came into his face, and went ſodainly back againe, out of the remembrance which this mad crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture brought vnto him of his Miſtris, whome he could not well knowe, aſwell becauſe he could not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend in his minde, by what meanes ſhe had bene redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to this diſtraction; and leſſe, how to this place, as alſo through her euill vſage in that place, &amp; her ſicknes, ſhe did differ from the Idea which he had of her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance in his minde. Neuertheles, as ſhe beheld him with her eyes full of admiration, he was confirmed in his firſt thought, and letting fall ſome teares, he ſaid vnto her in a lowe voyce (leaſt the Keeper who had bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ught them to the Table ſhould hear them) do ye know me? to whom this woman (neuer known to be ſo in that place) who had ſeene him caryed vnto the Oakes of the mountaine, where Captaine <hi>Doricles</hi> had commaunded
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:14312:28"/>
his Soldiers to hang him, for whoſe death ſhe had ſhed ſo many teares, and ſighed out ſo many complaintes, that the violence of her griefe had troubled her vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; and yet alſo doubting of his life, though ſhe did ſee him; tremblingly anſwered, that ſhe was wont to knowe him: Already was this Pilgrim, by the voyce, by the fearfulnes, and by the teares aſſured, that this mad body was the maſter of all his wittes; and fearing leaſt he might make ſome demonſtration of his inward griefe, whereunto by the ſight of this ſo great miſfortune he was obliged; he demanded ſoftly of her, how and by what meanes ſhe was come vnto this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable eſtate? The griefe I tooke (anſwered ſhe) think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vpon your death, ſo ſoone as the Captain had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded that you ſhould be hanged, not without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing offended me, replyed the Pilgrim, a thing which I neuer expected from your conſtancy, although farre greater occaſion had bene offered. The looſing of my honour (ſaid ſhe) muſt be out of theſe two reſpects, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of force or for pleaſure: if out of pleaſure, I had now no cauſe to bewaile my ſelfe; nor if it were by force meanes to bring remedy, and leſſe meanes had I in loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of my wittes; And that it is true, that the very thought I had of your death was the cauſe of my mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, let this ſatisfie you, to ſee that I recouer them, in hauing you aliue. Faire <hi>Niſa</hi> anſwered the Pilgrim, am not I a miſerable man, in hauing bene the cauſe of ſo much euill by my misfortunes? There is nothing deere <hi>Pamfilus</hi> (replyed <hi>Niſa</hi> in weeping) deſerues this name that hath bene ſuffered for your occaſion, and for ſo cruell a feeling as the report of your death brought
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:14312:28"/>
to me; And if I were permitted to imbrace you heere according vnto my deſire, the recompence would be as great as the trauels, which I doe bewayle onely, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard they were no more, ſince that, according to their multitude, they would augment the glory of my ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. It was not in vaine, anſwered <hi>Pamphilus,</hi> (for the Hiſtory names him from hence forward) that my hope made me deſire to liue, onely that I might ſee you, for I was aſſured that in the glory of beholding you, all iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie would be wiped away, that might any way allay my ioy. And if the eyes of thoſe who looke vpon vs, did not better ſee, then their vnderſtandings doe know, you ſhould before this haue found, that your deſire of imbracing was moſt agreable vnto me. To this ſaid <hi>Niſa</hi> (whoſe name hitherto wee haue hid) as alſo <hi>Pamphilus</hi> his, becauſe that trauailing in this habit amongſt ſo many dangers, (I durſt not tell their Country nor their name) I will make my paſſion ſerue as a remedy. What paſſion anſwered <hi>Pamphilus.</hi> Euery time ſaid ſhee when my griefe depriues me of my reaſon, they tell me that I cry aloude, thoſe wordes which I will now ſay to thee, in imbracing thee. And then ſhe ſaid theſe wordes; O my ſpouſe, is it poſſible that my eyes doe behold thee? Is it not thou, who dyed in the mountaines of <hi>Barcelon,</hi> by the euill hands of <hi>Doricles</hi> barbarous Soldiers? bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed bee the houre wherein I ſee the newes is falſe. In ſpeaking this, <hi>Niſa</hi> fell about <hi>Pamphilus</hi> his necke, amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly imbracing him, whoſe vnſpeakable pleaſure was onely interrupted, by the preſence of the aſſiſtants.</p>
               <p>When the man who had the charge of appeaſing the mad ſolkes fury, ſawe this deportment in <hi>Niſa,</hi> hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:14312:29"/>
to giue her rude words, and more ſharpe blowes. Let him alone ſaid <hi>Pamphilus,</hi> for I am his Countriman and his wiues kinſman, and doe not wonder that this ſight of me, doth cauſe in him this ſortowe. Whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer you are, anſwered this barbarous fellow, it skils not, heere is neither complements nor viſitations: And the token of this mans mad fit in comming vpon him, is to call his Husband, with ſuch or the like wordes. But if I pacifie this his mad fit ſaid <hi>Pamphilus,</hi> to what eud doth your chaſticement ſerue? And how will you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe it ſaid the other, Is not this an euident token of his madnes, that he cals you his ſpouſe, and takes you for a woman? You are ignorant of his humour, and of the trouble he giues vs, although he doe not appeare to be aboue Nineteene yeare of age; I know all this well, anſwered <hi>Pamphilus.</hi> Neuertheles let me ſpeake to him, for I do aſſure you that my ſelfe alone can appeaſe him; and as it is a good worke, from any body who hath a ſicknes to take away the paine, for ſome time, though it returne againe; So in madnes, it is a good worke, to bring to paſſe, that hee who hath loſt his wits ſhould recouer them againe though it were but for one houre.</p>
               <p>Yet neither this reaſon, nor many other, ſerued him to any purpoſe, for the officers had already put mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles vpon <hi>Niſa's</hi> hands; and the maſter, did rigorouſly pull her to the Cage, although ſhe had no neede of this remedy, nor any other, but the ſight of <hi>Pamphilus.</hi> But as thoſe who are accuſtomed to lye, are ſeldome beleeued, although they ſay the truth: So in him who is mad, it is accounted a token of greater madnes, to ſeeme wiſe. Thus <hi>Niſa</hi> was had away to ſtraight impriſonment, and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:14312:29"/>
                  <hi>Pamphilus</hi> ſtanding aſhamed, fearing that euory one knew, what was priuy only to himſelfe, beheld her with abundance of teares; A thouſand times hee was about to let goe the reynes of his paſſion, which his vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding held in, and to bee mad in reaſon, beleeuing that if hee were mad, the chaſtiſement of his madnes, ſhould be to remaine with <hi>Niſa,</hi> which was the greateſt good he could hope for. And to begin his deſigne, he offered (againſt the Lawes of this houſe) to breake the gates of the Priſon, and ſee her by force: but hardly had hee made any demonſtration thereof, whenas the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters with the mad ſeruitors, (ſuch as hauing recouered their wits, do ſerue the others) fell vpon him, &amp; beating him cruelly, flung him into the ſtreet, where (as the Fiſh whereof <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſpeakes, which being drawne out of the water, frameth a humane voyce &amp; dyeth) he fetch'd a great figh and fell vpon the ground aſtoniſhed.</p>
               <p>The Sunne was declined lowe toward the Weſt, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering with gold and purple that part of the Horizon, when <hi>Pamphilus</hi> returning out of his aſtoniſhment, found himſelfe in the armes of a young man, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing compaſſion of his griefe, incouraged him to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer life. <hi>Pamphilus</hi> looking ſtedfaſtly vpon him, with heauy ſadnes, demanded where he was? the young man tolde him, that hee was at the doore of the Hoſpitall, where the mad folkes were kept. And how is it, reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Pamphilus,</hi> that I am not within? becauſe (ſaid the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) thou appeareſt, to be more diſeaſed in body then in the paſſions of thy minde: Thou iudgeſt by the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, (ſaid <hi>Pamphilus)</hi> but if thou hadſt ſeene my heart, thou wouldſt rather iudge that my euill procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:14312:30"/>
from my ſpirit: True it is, that the body feeleth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the paines of the minde; What kind of euill is thine anſwered the young man, being ſo neare the place, where euils of wounded mindes are cured? For if thou art not within the Hoſpital, thou deſireſt (as it ſeemeth) to be in, ſeeing thou doeſt not deny thy euill; and thou confeſſeſt, that it proceedeth from thy minde, the paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons whereof, are not farre from falling into that infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, which is cured in this place. The euill which I haue, (ſaid <hi>Pamphilus)</hi> hath a remedy in this houſe, and my misfortune is ſuch, that diſpairing to cure me, they haue flung me out. Thou canſt haue no ſuch euill, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the young man, but there is an Antidote to bee found for it. Incurable Loue (ſaid <hi>Pamphilus</hi> is groa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning out a ſigh) vnto which all the medicines &amp; Herbes of Phyſicke are improfitable. What is not Loue to be cured, anſwered the other? And are <hi>Auicens</hi> ſeauen re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies of no force, and not true? Of thoſe ſaid <hi>Pamphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> and at the tales which <hi>Pliny</hi> writeth, my paſſion wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth; I onely allow of his counſell, who aduiſeth chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to marry; but the diſpoſition of my fortune, and the rigorous influence of my ſtarres, not onely doe not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer me, but maketh it to me almoſt impoſſible. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though hope ſometime promiſeth it vnto me, yet I find that it is truely as <hi>Plato</hi> calleth it; <hi>The waking man his Dreame:</hi> Loue, then (ſaid the young man) is the cauſe of this habite which thou weareſt, &amp; of thy pilgrimage. It is ſo (ſaid <hi>Pamphilus)</hi> and by that thou mayeſt know the quality of my euill, and the difficulty of my cure. Oh, ſaid the young man pittifully ſighing, what a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous ſtory, doſt thou renew in me? A hiſtory like vnto
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:14312:30"/>
mine ſaid <hi>Pamphilus;</hi> if not ſaid the other, yet at the leaſt of Loue; By thy faith (then ſaid <hi>Pamphilus)</hi> doeſt thou loue? I not onely Loue ſaid the other, but am al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo more vnhappy then thou thinkeſt for; a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and a Pilgrim, and no leſſe outraged by fortune. Tell me then ſaid <hi>Pamphilus,</hi> (in looking earneſtly vpon him) thy name and of what Countrey thou art; for in all the yeares of my baniſhment, I could neuer finde any man ſo miſerably perſecuted as my ſelfe: and in this, I haue more occaſion, then all men to bewaile my deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. A Chriſtian ſaid the ſtranger, ought neuer to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile the deſtinies, nor thinke that good or euill for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune depend of them: Although many ancient Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers haue beleeued, that there is a kinde of Deuils, and certaine imaginary women which they call <hi>Parquae,</hi> which giue the ſpirit vnto the creature at the birth, an opinon rather worthy of laughter, then beliefe; It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt certaine, that this name Deſtiny, is onely to be attributed to the decree of God, who truly ſeeth and knoweth all thinges before they be, and the ordering of them ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not depend of any thing but of him; I know well ſaid <hi>Pamphilus,</hi> that the Poets haue called theſe <hi>Parquaes</hi> deſtiny, and the Philoſophers eſpecially the <hi>Stoyques,</hi> haue beleeued that it is an order, or diſpoſition of ſecond cauſes, as from the Planets vnder the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of which we are borne, which rule and determine all the inferiour good and euill effects which doe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to man: So ſaid <hi>Ptolomy, Democritus, Criſippus,</hi> and <hi>Epicurus,</hi> who alſo aſcribe to Deſtiny, all the inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the vices, and the vertues, the deſires and paſſions euen vnto the actions and thoughts, which ſome ha<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="2 letters">

endeuoured to proue by the authority of <hi>Boeceus,</hi> who ſaith, that the order of Deſtiny mooueth the Heauen, and the Starres tempereth the Elements, and tyeth hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane actions to their cauſes by a moſt indiſſolueable knot.</p>
               <p>But leauing a part a matter of ſo long a diſcourſe, from whence is ſprung the error of the <hi>Priſcillianiſts,</hi> who doe beleeue that the ſoule and the body, are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily ſubiect vnto the Starres, and many other errors which doe ſucceed this firſt.

habite and equipage of a man at Armes, and after ſent his ſeruants to <hi>Alcala</hi> of <hi>Henares,</hi> and there diſguiſing himſelfe in other clothes, he went to <hi>Toledo:</hi> where not being knowne to any perſon, he found meanes to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained as a ſeruant in my fathers houſe, which was no hard matter to doe, becauſe that his excellent fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and countenance, accompanied with his vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding were pledges ſufficient of his fidelity, &amp; gaue my Father not onely a deſire to bee ſerued by him, but alſo to reſpect him.</p>
               <p>My father receiued him, ignorant of his quality, and of his intent (a ſtrange imagination of a man, beeing a Knight, and ſo well knowne almoſt of all, in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey wherein he was borne; that he could ſo hide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, at the Doore (as it were) of his owne houſe, that no body could know, either where hee was or what hee did:) yet ſo it was, that his humility, his diligent ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, and other commendable partes, which hee had, gained ſuch credit with my Parents, that I doe beleeue he might as eaſily haue compaſſed his deſignes, with his fayned pouerty, as with his true riches.</p>
               <p>The chiefeſt thing whereunto he applyed himſelfe as his whole ſtudy, was to appeare agreable to <hi>Niſa,</hi> which was eaſie to be done, for who can guard himſelfe from a domeſticke enemy? The ſimplicity wherewith this Knight did begin his treaſon, and the good wordes which he vſed, gained him entrance into thoſe places, whereinto hardly and with great difficulty, could the ancient ſeruants come. Behold with how little care, a noble Gentleman kept in his houſe, another <hi>Greeke</hi> horſe, like vnto miſerable <hi>Troy:</hi> For ſuch of neceſſity

muſt this young mans heart needs bee, full of thoughts and armed with malice, which (the houre of executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on approaching) brake forth into ſuch flames, as haue fired our renowne. When <hi>Pamphilus</hi> thought that <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa</hi> was diſpoſed to hearken to his intention, were it that his ſicknes were true, or fained; as moſt likely it was, he made himſelfe ſicke.

The Phyſitians ſaid, that this infirmity proceded from a deepe melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, and the beſt remedy that was to be giuen, was to reioyce him, and principally by Muſicke; In which they were not deceiued, for if Loue doe participate of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill ſpirit, and that <hi>Dauid</hi> draue away the euill ſpirit from <hi>Saul</hi> by the ſweetnes of his Harpe, by the ſame meanes Loue might be driuen away.

               <p>Heere <hi>Pamphilus</hi> demaunded of <hi>Celio</hi> (wondring that bee ſhould tell ſo perticularly, that which paſſed ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly betweene him and <hi>Niſa)</hi> how hee knew the ſame wordes which they had ſpoken, hee being at that time a farre off, following his ſtudy in <hi>Salamanqua?</hi> To which <hi>Celio</hi> anſwered, that the ſame <hi>Pamphilus</hi> had left the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in writing with a friend of his, from whome hauing
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:14312:34"/>
had the meanes ſince that time to get it, hee learned all vnto the leaſt particuler, and then proceeding on his diſcourſe, he began in this manner.</p>
               <p>The colour which came into <hi>Niſa's</hi> face when ſhee heard <hi>Pamphilus</hi> his wordes, cannot bee compared, but vnto the red Roſe, with milken leaues, although it be a Poeticall terme, and borrowed of the ſame author, yet feyning not to vnderſtand what he ſaid, ſhee anſwered, that if it were any of her friends ſhee would indeauour (at the leaſt) to bring it about that ſhee ſhould knowe his euill, that thereupon he might lay the foundation of his remedy. I am in that eſtate ſaid <hi>Pamphilus</hi> that I dare not ſo much as ſigh or breath out her name, yet I can ſhew you her portrature, who is the originall cauſe of my misfortune, and for whoſe ſake, I am come from my own Country into yours, where I remaine an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſeruant of your houſe, and doe thinke my ſelfe moſt happy to be ſo, although I am a Knight, and equall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her, whome you call your friend, and with whome I ſhould haue bin now marryed, if my Father had liued vntill this day, for onely his Death barred me of this happines. And in ſaying theſe wordes, <hi>Pamphilus</hi> gaue her, her Picture, which had bin drawne by the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Painter of our time, called <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Lianho;</hi> whoſe penſill oftentimes durſt compare with Nature herſelfe, who out of meere enuy vnto him, for that, (as it ſeemed) ſhortned his dayes. Yet <hi>Niſa</hi> (through whoſe veynes ran a colde ſhiuering) affirmed, that ſhee did not know the face; I doe not wonder ſaid <hi>Pamphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> that the auntient Philoſopher hath deliuered his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion; that it is a very hard matter to know ones ſelfe.
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:14312:35"/>
Putting this ſentence; <hi>Know thy ſelfe;</hi> in the fronts of the moſt famous Temples. Yet ſee another more naturall, the knowledge wherof you ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not deny. Saying this, he reached her a very faire looking-glaſſe: <hi>Niſa</hi> ſeeing her face within the Chriſtall, could no longer ſuffer his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, nor the Knights preſence: But riſing vp in col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, ſaid vnto him in great anger as ſhe went away, thy boldnes ſhall coſt thee thy life. Can it bee better im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed anſwered <hi>Pamphilus,</hi> then for your beauty to be ended?</p>
               <p>She anſwered well, ſaid the Pilgrim, if ſhee had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed what ſhe ſaid. She accompliſhed it ſo ill replied <hi>Celio,</hi> that within a fewe dayes ſhee loued him, better then ſhe loued herſelfe, prouing the Verſe of the famous Poet <hi>Dant</hi> to bee infallibly true; that Loue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſeth no one who is beloued from louing. But how came it (ſaid the Pilgrim) that a Mayd ſhould Loue; who had harkened with ſo much diſdaine in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning? Becauſe anſwered <hi>Celio,</hi> that all Mayds for their firſt anſwer conſult with ſhame, and for their ſecond conſult with weaknes: Although for my owne part, I thinke that <hi>Pamphilus</hi> diſpairing of his remedy helped himſelfe with charmes. I cannot beleeue ſo, anſwered <hi>Pamphilus,</hi> a man hath liberty to Loue, and not to loue as it ſeemeth good vnto himſelfe, and it ſeemes to bee a terrible and cruell thing that a chaſt woman ſhould be violently conſtrained to Loue, whether ſhee would or no: Charmes and witchcrafts, may peraduenture moue, perſwade, and tempt, without ſuffering to be in reſt, and with theſe exteriour perſwaſions make one yeeld vnto the prayers and teares of a Louer: Yet for all this it
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:14312:35"/>
cannot be ſaid, that ſhee is conſtrained but that of her good will, ſhee giueth conſent to her deſire, ſuffering her ſelfe rather to bee vanquiſhed by her owne proper nature, then by the force of any Art <hi>Magicke.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is an euident folly, in thoſe which Loue, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine that they are violently conſtrained, will they nill they, to follow their Loues, becauſe God neuer ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth that the po<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

It is not likely, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Celio,</hi> and it may be, that hee witneſſing his fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity by other ſeruices, obliged her to condiſcend vnto his will, for <hi>Niſa</hi> is not the onely woman in this world ſubiect to this weaknes.</p>
               <p>Neuertheles behold the ſtrange accident, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened vnto them both, as a beginning of their misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes; for it being ſpoken at <hi>Madreele,</hi> that <hi>Pamphilus</hi> was come from <hi>Flanders,</hi> the newes thereof came vnto my Fathers eares, who (deſirous to make him his Son in Law, in fauour of the ancient acquaintance and loue he had with his Father, and becauſe that it had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly agreed betweene them) one day tolde her, that hee was reſolued to Marry her, not naming vnto whome; and thereupon writing to <hi>Madreele,</hi> to <hi>Pamphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> his Mother, intreating her to ſend him to <hi>Toledo,</hi> congratulating alſo with her, her Sonnes happy return and the proſperous ſucceſſe of his affaires, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:14312:36"/>
vnto her the amitie which he had contracted with her husband, his Father. The ſad <hi>Niſa,</hi> who already deſperatly loued <hi>Pamphilus,</hi> tolde him, that her Father would marry her, and the Knight who was deſigned for her Husband, was ſhortly to come from <hi>Madreele</hi> vnto their houſe, but ſhee knew nothing in particuler more of him, but that he was a braue Soldier who lately came out of <hi>Flanders. Pamphilus</hi> (ignorant that hee was the perſon who was meant) fell into great extremity at the newes, and after many teares and other follies, hee ſaid, he was reſolued to be gone, for his heart would neuer ſuffer him to ſee a new ſeruant vnto his Miſtris in this houſe. A ſtrange and neuer heard of ſtory, that a man ſhould bee iealous of himſelfe, and flye from his owne preſence. <hi>Niſa</hi> who now thought it as impoſſible for her to bee without <hi>Pamphilus,</hi> as the Earth without wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Fire without matter to burne, or as the Coeleſtiall harmony without their firſt mouer; ſaid vnto him in weeping, that ſhee would haue him take her away with him, and that ſhe would follow him ouer the world; yet vpon this condition, that hee ſhould ſweare ſolemnly, neuer to looſe the reſpect which was due vnto her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: which oath being taken by <hi>Pamphilus</hi> without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny conſideration of the danger which might happen: he made choyſe of a darke night, &amp; by a Garden which anſwereth vpon the Riner, tooke her from the houſe, and by the ſame riuer went from the Towne, carrying her in his Barke, vntill he came vnto thoſe Mountaines which are called <hi>Stſla:</hi> This was it which hee writ after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards from <hi>Valence,</hi> to a friend of his of <hi>Saragoſſa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now followeth the beginning of my peregrination,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:14312:36"/>
which (hauing bin to long in this Hiſtory) I will brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly relate. At the dolourous Letter which was written to me of this ſucceſſe, (which was diſcouered, ſo ſoone as <hi>Pamphilus</hi> was gone from <hi>Toledo)</hi> I came from <hi>Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manqua</hi> to my fathers houſe, which I found all in mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for the loſſe of my Siſter. My Father in few words obliged me to reuenge it, which I ſwore that I would, with many wordes as free, as his were graue: and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute my intent I went to <hi>Madreele.</hi> I ſought <hi>Pamphilus</hi> in all the houſes of his friends, and viſited his Mother, asking newes of him, making ſhew how things had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. The innocent Mother ſaid, it was two yeares ſince hee went into <hi>Flaunders,</hi> and that from the time of his departure, ſhe neuer had heard from him, from whence ſhe collected he was dead. I thought that ſhe, knowing what he had done, had diſguiſed the truth: and while I was in this meditation, I caſting my eyes vpon a young Gentlewoman, who ſate ſowing by this reuerend ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, I found her in my minde ſo faire, that her onely looke, had power to temper my ſorrow, and hardly had I fully viewed her perfections, when as I propounded in my ſelfe to ſerue her, and to ſteale her away, thinking by this meanes to giue ſatisfaction to our honour, and beginning to my reuenge. To recount vnto you at this time all the paſſages, and the care which I vſed to ſpeake with her, and to bring her to my will, would be to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you with a long diſcourſe; Let it ſatisfie, that I drewe her from her houſe with the ſame thred, where with <hi>Pamphilus</hi> had pulled <hi>Niſa</hi> from ours, and in a ſtrange and fooliſh minde led her into <hi>France,</hi> where her beauty miniſtred ſubiect vnto a Knight to ſerue her,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:14312:37"/>
and for me to kill him: From whence it followed, that for ſafety of my life I was driuen to leaue her. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, I am reſolued whatſoeuer happen vnto me, to goe ſeeke her, becauſe that beſides, I doe loue her more then my ſelfe, I owe ſo much vnto her merit and vertue, with which ſhee hath faithfully accompanied me, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough many and variable ſucceſſes.</p>
               <p>Night had ſpred his blacke vayle ouer the face of the Earth, and the houſes were full of Candles, as the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen of ſtarres; men and creatures retired themſelues, from their common labour, when as the miſerable <hi>Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus</hi> gaue ouer hearing the tragedy of his Loue, with the laſt act of his honour: and to know that he did then but begin to ſuffer his euils, when he thought he was at an end of them, Hee admired the iuſtice of Heauen, which had ſuffred that his Siſter ſhould ſo lightly haue quited her Mothers houſe, to runne away with a man; Yet finding in himſelfe the example of his owne miſlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of <hi>Niſa,</hi> and that the iniury which hee had done vnto <hi>Celio,</hi> was no leſſe then that which hee had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; he did not hold it iuſt in himſelfe, once to thinke of reuenge, but rather to perſwade him that hee ſhould not, nor ought to leaue her, which he performed with the beſt wordes, &amp; the liuelieſt reaſons he could deuiſe. Remonſtrating vnto him, that amongſt Gentlemen, the onely condition of noblenes, ſhould binde him to goe ſeeke for her, which <hi>Celio</hi> allowing for moſt reaſonable, gaue him his word, to imploy his endeauours to that purpoſe. And being lodged this night together, they ſupped and ſlept in one houſe. The next morning <hi>Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus</hi> gaue him a Letter to a French Gentleman, with
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:14312:37"/>
whom he had great acquaintance, that he might fauour him in finding out <hi>Finia,</hi> for ſo was his Siſter called. But <hi>Celio</hi> departed not for certain dayes, during which time there was a perfect friendſhip knit betweene thoſe two ſecret enemies; So that <hi>Pamphilus</hi> knowing the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence which <hi>Celio</hi> had done vnto him, pardoned him in his hart, and <hi>Celio</hi> ignorant that this was <hi>Pamphilus,</hi> was diſpoſed to the pardoning of him. The reſolution was with great oathes to enquire out one the other, and to helpe each other in all accidents as Brothers; aſſigning the rende-vous within ſixe monthes, in the Citty of <hi>Pamphelune.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So went <hi>Celio</hi> vpon his enterpriſe; &amp; ſome few dayes after his departure, <hi>Pamphilus</hi> his ſorrow increaſing out of the opinion that it was impoſſible for him to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <hi>Niſa;</hi> It happened that going one night from his lodging, in a vaine deſire he had to ſee the windowes of the Priſon (where his happines and ioy was incloſed) he heard a Knight cry out for helpe againſt ſome who would at aduantage haue killed him. He ſodainly ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped vnto him, and drawing out his Sword out of his Palmers ſtaffe with an incredible dexterity, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with a valiant &amp; braue courage, made them looſe him, whom they would haue killed, and ſaue their own liues by a ſhamefull, though a ſafe flight.</p>
               <p>The Knight would needs know what hee was, who had deliuered him from ſo great danger: and although <hi>Pamphilus</hi> excuſed himſelfe from telling his name, yet the Knights deſire, and curteſie preuayled more, then the humblenes wherewith the Pilgrim did endeauour to perſwade him, that hee had done him no ſeruice: to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:14312:38"/>
conclude, he led him to his houſe, where his good and gentle behauiour being obſerued, the Knight and his Parents bare ſuch affection vnto him, that they did ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige him to become their gueſt.</p>
               <p>There remained <hi>Pamphilus</hi> ſome dayes, at the end of which, <hi>Iacinth</hi> (ſo was this Knight called) tolde him the hiſtory of his Loue, vnto faire <hi>Lucinde,</hi> and the occaſion for which theſe aſſaſſiuators wold haue murther'd him, who, for this onely cauſe, were come from <hi>Ciuill</hi> vnto <hi>Valence,</hi> where the ſubiect of the paſſion, and the ſorrow wherein he liued did remaine. I doe beleeue that Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers haue ſome ſimpathy one with another, and that they ioyne and communicate, in ſuch manner as you haue ſeene in this diſcourſe. Seeing that our Pilgrim neuer came into any houſe, where there was not ſome one, or other tainted with this euill, although it were in craggy Mountaines.</p>
               <p>By this ouerture of <hi>Iacinthes</hi> ſecret, <hi>Pamphilus</hi> was bound to diſcouer his: and after hee had made him ſweare, that he would graunt him his requeſt, hee ſaid; that in recompence of his life, which hee had ſaued, as he himſelfe confeſſed, he coniured him, to helpe him to a place, in that Priſon where the mad ſolkes were ſhut vp. <hi>Iacinth</hi> aſtoniſhed at ſo ſtrange a requeſt, would needs know the cauſe. But <hi>Pamphilus</hi> promiſing to tell him ſo ſoone as he had done him that fauour, and caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelfe at his feete with moſt earneſt and vnheard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of wordes, affirming the good hee ſhould doe him, to put him in this place: made <hi>Iacinth</hi> ſuſpect, that ſome ſecret danger did inforce him into that place. And wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling very generouſly to ſatisfie the obligation wherein
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:14312:38"/>
hee was tyed, after ſome inconueniences and reaſons vrged to diuert him, hauing agreed with him of the meanes which he ſhould holde, This very night <hi>Iacinth</hi> tooke fiue or ſixe men of the Hoſpitall, who entring ſodainly into <hi>Pamphilus</hi> his Chamber, put him in a Chayre, and carryed him away in their armes: miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble condition of this man, who after ſo many ſtrange ſucceſſes, being wiſe (if thoſe who Loue can be ſo) to make himſelfe to bee taken and ſhut vp willingly, as a mad-man, where all the mad folkes would willingly bee accounted wiſe.</p>
               <p>All <hi>Iacinthes</hi> houſe admire at this nouelty, and all his family complaine that this ſtranger, vnto whom <hi>Iacinth</hi> was redeuable for his life, was ſo vnworthily requited by <hi>Iacinth</hi> himſelfe: But ſhee who moſt complained of his cruelty, and had the trueſt feeling of it, was <hi>Tiberia</hi> his Siſter, who was both faire and diſcreet aboue all the Ladies in <hi>Valence,</hi> who affecting the gentlenes, and faire ſpirit of our vnfortunate Pilgrim, did not ſee but by his eyes, and did not breath but from him. <hi>Iacinth</hi> told them that <hi>Pamphilus</hi> was mad, and that it was neceſſary hee ſhould be cured before the diſeaſe increaſed too farre. The Father of this Knight, who was very Learned, bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med exceedingly this precipite courſe, ſaying that in all infirmities, there was nothing more dangerous, then Phyſicke out of ſeaſon, and ſwore that he ſhould be had out of the Hoſpitall, to bee cured in his houſe. <hi>Tiberia</hi> confirmed this piety, ſaying; that reward due vnto him, they being not ſo poore, but that they had meanes ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, to haue him cured in their houſe, with greater care of his health, and leſſe ſcandall to his honour.
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:14312:39"/>
                  <hi>Iacinth</hi> replyed, that he was a Stranger, &amp; that no body knew him. But all the houſhold were ſo much againſt him, blaming him for ingratitude, eſpecially his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; his Siſter, that he was conſtrayned to tell them what he knew. Whereat in imagining the cauſe, all of them were aſtoniſhed and wondred. They thought that <hi>Pamphilus</hi> was a ſpy, who went diſguiſed vnder the habite of a Pilgrim, and that fearing to be knowne by ſome one, hee vſed this ſubtilty to ſaue his life: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he ſpake Spaniſh, neuertheleſſe, by his faire face and exceeding beauty, he ſeemed a ſtranger, and by his actions a Gentleman. With this confeſſion, <hi>Iacinth</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in their good opinion, the houſe was much troubled, and <hi>Tiberia</hi> was full of pittifull griefe and care for <hi>Pamphilus</hi> his life: who being in Priſon among the mad folkes (in the iudgement of many, the very center of greateſt miſery) imagined himſelfe to bee in moſt glorious happines.</p>
               <p>To this new Madman, the more ancient gaue place, and <hi>Pamphilus,</hi> with diuers faynings &amp; counterfetings of his face, endeauoured to expreſſe his madnes; which faſhion of his, ſeeming vnto them as tokens of raſhnes, they put him into the Priſon with Irons on his handes, where to confirme them the more in their opinion of his madnes, hee ſaid ſo many wordes ſo farre from the matter, that hee did merit a beleefe. There he ſtayed ſome fewe dayes before he could ſee his beloued <hi>Niſa,</hi> ſuffering moſt inſupportable diſcommodities, difficult to be ſpoken, and almoſt impoſſible to bee beleeued; In the meane time <hi>Celio</hi> went by <hi>Saragoſſe</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> to finde his beautifull and beloued <hi>Finia</hi> whom hee had
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:14312:39"/>
loſt, where being come, hee heard the newes of the Peace which was proclaimed, betweene the two Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which made him reſt that night (with more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment out of the facility which it brought to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne) ſtaying for the Light of the morning, to cleere his paſſage ouer the Mountaines into <hi>France.</hi>

to accompliſh them: ſaid vnto her in comforting her, that if ſhee had ſuffered this miſery for him, and that they ought to be all one, there was no reaſon but hee ſhould haue his part of this miſery, to the end that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall in all thinges, their marriage might bee, without aduantage of one ſide or other, and that his Loue vnto her did preuaile ſo farre as not to let paſſe one day, without ſeeing her, notwithſtanding any danger, and although his honour were thereby in hazard.

How much doth he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend <hi>Niſa's</hi> vertue, and the chaſt, but louing defence which ſhee made of her honour, for <hi>Pamphilus</hi> being a man had yeelded often vnto his paſſion, if ſhee had not moderated his violence. With what grace they gaue madly, fauours one vnto another, of the vildeſt thinges they could finde vpon the ground, which <hi>Pamphilus</hi> ſtucke in his hat, in ſteed of Iewels or feathers, which he was wont to weare: But fortune enuying their conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tednes, euen in this miſery, would not let them liue in this place at reſt, but arming himſelfe a new againſt them, euen at that time when as they thought (by <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinthes</hi> helpe) to get out of that Priſon, There came vnto this Citty an <hi>Italian</hi> Earle, of the houſe of <hi>Anqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lora</hi> called <hi>Emelio,</hi> who deſiring to haue a Foole with him, promiſed a great Almes vnto their houſe, if they would giue him a mad-man, who hauing loſt his fury might entertaine him with ſport. Thoſe of the Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall ſayled not to promiſe him one, and withall to bring him to his lodging ſome of their moſt peaceable mad-men,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:14312:41"/>
amongſt whome, were the Pilgrim <hi>Pamphilus</hi> and the faire <hi>Niſa.</hi> The Earle ioyfull to ſee them, inquired of their bringers their conditions? one of whome an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered thus:</p>
            <p>This man ſtrong &amp; able who you ſee there, was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a braue Soldier, who hauing ſerued vpon many occaſions like a <hi>Hector,</hi> deſired the reward of his valour which he had meritted aboue all other. But he finding himſelfe denied, and that it was giuen vnto the coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt fellow in the Army: fell from this imaginatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into ſo profound a melancholy, that hee loſt his wits. He hath loſt his fury in the Priſon although oftentimes it returneth. His diſcourſe is alwayes of Marſhalling an Army, of beſieging a Fort, of lodging a Campe, or cauſing it to march. All is Sluces, Dikes, Trenches, Platformes, Rauelins, Caſſamats, Flanckers, Palliſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does, Counterſcarfes, Squadrons, Cannons, Muskets, Piſtols, Corſelets, Pikes. This weake and pale man, is of another humor, who hauing giuen himſelf too much to the ſtudy of Philoſophy, loſt his vnderſtanding. Of this man the Earle demanded which was the <hi>Primum mobile,</hi> either <hi>Coelum Imperium,</hi> or <hi>Coelum Chriſtalinum?</hi> vnto whom the madman anſwered thus:</p>
            <p>After the mouing Sphaeres by a locall motion, the Diuines doe teach vs, that there is another Heauen per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually in reſt from all motion, created from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and full of an innumerable thouſands of intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligences, and of happy ſpirits, which were created toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in it, &amp; with it. In ſuch ſort as the mingled bodyes are accuſtomed to ingender ſome thinges in inferiour places, as Fiſhes in the water, Birdes in the ayre, and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:14312:41"/>
the vegitatiue creatures, Plants and Minerals in the earth. This Heauen for the greatnes, and for the ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable light, for which it is called <hi>Imperiall,</hi> as who ſhould ſay Fiery (not for the naturall property of Fire, but for the glorious cleerneſſe wherewith it ſhineth) is the Throne deſtined before the conſtitution of the world, and as a Royall pallace ordained from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, for all thoſe who are to raigne before the face of God, the light whereof is ſo luſtrous and cleere, that the corporall eyes cannot behold or looke vpon it, no more then the Birds of the night can the Sunne.</p>
            <p>All the aſſiſtants remaining aſtoniſhed at this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, one other of the mad-men began to cry, calling his Dogs, and lewring his Haukes, like a great Fauco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and Huntſman as he had beene; of whome, as the Earle began to laugh, <hi>Pamphilus</hi> ſaid thus vnto him; you ought not mocke at this exerciſe, but at thoſe who exerciſe it vnorderly and vntimely, without reſpecting either ſeaſon or place: For according to <hi>Xenephon</hi> and <hi>Athaneus,</hi> Hunting was famous amongſt the Perſians. <hi>Homer</hi> ſaith, it was practiſed amongſt the Greeks, that thereby their Young men might become more hardy; For as <hi>Horace</hi> writeth, the Hunter often lyeth abroad in the colde night, without remembring his wife. <hi>Philon</hi> the Hebrew telleth notable thinges of Hunting, in his <hi>Preface vnto his warfare. Cicero</hi> ſaith no leſſe, in his book of <hi>The nature of the Gods.</hi> And <hi>Peter Gregory</hi> ſaith, that the originall therof, was in the beginning of the world, to the end that men ſhould be able to free themſelues from the perſecutions of Beaſts. If Hunting replyed the Earle, (who was a man of great knowledge) had not
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:14312:42"/>
paſſed from the honeſt exerciſe, (the imitation of warre) vnto that of pleaſure, who would doubt of the excellency thereof? but in regard of the hurt it doth in the fieldes, and the expence which it bringeth vnto him who followeth it? <hi>Lewes</hi> the twelfth King of <hi>France</hi> iuſtly forbad it: For what elſe is the meaning of the fable of <hi>Acteon,</hi> deuoured by his Dogs, but that ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much Hunting waſteth both goods and life? And paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by many other thinges, which might be gathered from this Verſe of <hi>Virgill,</hi> Where hee ſaith, <hi>Eneas</hi> and ſad <hi>Dido</hi> went a hunting together in a Wood: Ioyned alſo the dangers of life which cannot bee tolde, neither is it to bee wondred at, that this man became mad, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that as <hi>Dion</hi> aſſureth the ſame exerciſe made the Emperour <hi>Adrian</hi> a foole. Then anſwered the mad Hunter, that with more reaſon ſhould hee be laide in this place for a madman, becauſe he would perſwade mad-men, and reaſon with them who had no reaſon.</p>
            <p>The diſcourſe of this madman, ſaith the Earle ſauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring nothing of madnes; obligeth me to anſwer: For a man muſt fight with thoſe who giue occaſion, play with ſuch as haue money, and anſwer vnto euery one in the ſame manner hee ſpeaketh. But if all the mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in <hi>Spaine,</hi> were as you, and that my Children ſhold remaine there, I ſhould rather deſire to haue them ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant then Learned; Know ſaid the Foole that if it were poſſible a man ſhould deſire to be borne in <hi>France</hi> to liue in <hi>Italy,</hi> and to dye in <hi>Spaine,</hi> to be borne for the noblenes of the <hi>French,</hi> who alwayes haue had their King of their owne Nation, and neuer mingled with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other; To liue, for the liberty and felicity of <hi>Italy:</hi>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:14312:42"/>
And to dye; for the Catholicke Faith which is ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine in all <hi>Spaine.</hi> And as concerning your Children, whatſoeuer happens of it, ſuffer them not to liue in Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance; For there is leſſe danger in being mad, then in being ignorant. Whileſt this man ſpake, another ſinging neare vnto him, let the Earle knowe that Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke had brought him to that eſtate, for it is ſaid; that it is a kinſwoman vnto Poetry: The ancients ſaid the mad-man, haue compriſed Muſicke amongſt the Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Sciences. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his Politiques, <hi>Budeus</hi> in his Commentary vpon the <hi>Greeke</hi> tongue, and <hi>Cealio</hi> the <hi>Rodian,</hi> doe ſay, that Muſicke is a mixture compounded of ſounds ſweet, flat and ſharpe. <hi>Plutarque</hi> in the life of <hi>Homer,</hi> putteth one voyce flat, and the other ſharpe, the flat voyce proceedeth from within, and the ſharpe from the ſuperfices of the mouth, and from their diuers tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering maketh the harmony; the obiect of the hearing is the ſound, and the reflection of the ayre; as <hi>Galen</hi> teacheth; and the ſound is made from the act of ſome one thing into another, by the meanes of the ſtroake which cauſeth it: two bodyes are required to make a ſound, becauſe that one cannot doe it. The Eccho is an ayre ſtrucke into hollow places, which reſiſting the ſtroke of the voyce, returneth the ſame wordes which are ſpoken. So ſay <hi>Themiſerus, Pliny, Ouid,</hi> and <hi>Macrobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> in his <hi>Saturnales.</hi> The voyce and the worde are not one thing, the worde holdeth the ground from the Tongue helped by the Noſtrils, the Lips and the Teeth: and the inſtruments of the Voyce are the Throat, the Muſtles which mooue, and the Nerues which come downe from the Braine.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:14312:43"/>
Who was the firſt inuenter of <hi>Muſick,</hi> asked the Earle? The mad-man anſwered, <hi>Ioſephus</hi> ſaith, that it was <hi>Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball, Adams</hi> nephew, although that others giue the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention to <hi>Mercury,</hi> as <hi>Gregory Gerand:</hi> and <hi>Philoſtratus</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Mercury</hi> learned it of <hi>Orpheus, Orpheus</hi> of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phion.</hi> But <hi>Euſebius</hi> attributeth it vnto Father <hi>Dioniſius.</hi> Then asked the Earle into how many partes Muſicke was diuided? The mad-man anſwered, according vnto <hi>Boetius,</hi> into the <hi>Theorique</hi> and the <hi>Practique,</hi> bee it ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Naturall, Artificiall, Celeſtiall or humane; The Naturall and Celeſtiall, is that which is conſidered in the harmony of all the parts of the world: the Humane is that which treateth of the proportions of the body and of the ſoule, and their partes: For <hi>Plato, Pithagoras,</hi> and <hi>Architas,</hi> haue thought, that the motions and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſions of the Starres, cannot bee without Muſicke: And <hi>Vitruuius</hi> is of that opiuion, that buildings are not framed without Muſicke. Leauing Celeſtiall and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, there followeth Artificiall diuided into muſicall Organs and Inſtruments.</p>
            <p>Thereupon the other mad-men began to put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, that whereof hee onely ſhewed the <hi>Theorique,</hi> and began to make ſuch a noyſe with confuſed, and diſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding voyces, that it was impoſſible to vnderſtand them. But being appeaſed, hee who kept the mad-men, made great account vnto the Earle, of a mad Aſtrologian, who by the contemplation of ſuch high thinges was fallen into this abaſement. Hardly had the Earle loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked vpon him, when he began to tell him, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and figure of the world, In its forme was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a <hi>Sphaere</hi> which was ſollid, and that paſſing aliue
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:14312:43"/>
through the middle, the Poles were placed in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treames or verticall points immouable: one made the North on this ſide of the Beare, and from the Starres of that part of Heauen called <hi>Aquilon, Boreall,</hi> or <hi>Artique;</hi> The other which was oppoſite by <hi>Diamiter</hi> was called <hi>Antartique</hi> and <hi>Meridionall;</hi> There was hee interrupted by others, who would not let him proceed, and after it was not poſſible to appeaſe them, although there were a great many more, Painters, Poets, and Mathematici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, but aboue all, there was an Alcumiſt, a famous Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of <hi>Ramond Lullius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At this time <hi>Emilius</hi> had fixed his eyes vpon <hi>Niſa,</hi> and beholding the ſadnes, with which ſhee was ſilent, hee demanded of the Maſter the humour of this mad creature? who anſwered him, that Loue had brought him to his folly, her delicate face, and the occaſion of her euill, gaue him at the ſame time, deſire and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion with ſuch affection, that agreeing with the Maſter, at the price of a hundred Crownes, hee made choyſe of her from amongſt all the other to leade her into <hi>Italy;</hi> But hardly had <hi>Pamphilus</hi> ſeene the effects of his electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when as his fury increaſing truely, which was before but fained, hee ſtrucke, he bit, and tooke on, as if he had beene inraged, againſt thoſe who tooke his deare <hi>Niſa</hi> away. But they being a great many againſt him alone, the Earle tooke her from the houſe, and ſhortly after from <hi>Valence.</hi> And <hi>Pamphilus</hi> tyed vp as a mad-man, was had backe againe with many grieuous blowes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayling bitterly the loſſe of his deare <hi>Niſa.</hi> And by how much he indeauoured, to make the Officers belieue that hee was not mad, by ſo much the more he perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:14312:44"/>
them, that he was not well in his wits: Becauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing oppreſſed with griefe he tolde them plainely, that he had cauſed himſelfe to be brought thether, onely to ſee this young mad creature, whome they had accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to bee a man, but indeed was a Woman and his wife, whom hee had concealed vnder this habit, for feare of her Father, from whom he had ſtollen her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
            <p>But they were ſo confirmed in their opinion of his madnes, that by thoſe reaſons, whereby hee did thinke they were tyed to giue him his liberty, hee made them more obſtinate to refuſe him, vntill they might haue more euident tokens of the tranquillity of his minde. Whileſt he did complaine to ſee that it ſerued him to no purpoſe to tell the truth, which of all thinges in the world doth moſt inrage a man, and that in regard of <hi>Iacinthes</hi> abſence, he could not tell vnto whom to haue recourſe: The vnfortunate <hi>Niſa</hi> was come to <hi>Barcelon,</hi> with ſo much ſorrow and teares, that <hi>Emilio</hi> already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented that hee had bought her: In aſmuch as there is nothing more vnprofitable then a ſad Foole. The Earle imbarked, not knowing that ſhe whom he led with him had the fortune of <hi>Scianus</hi> Horſe, which coſt his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters their liues: He indeauoured to reioyce <hi>Niſa,</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing her to ſit at his Table, to make her eate meate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was tolde him, that ſhe would famiſh her ſelfe to death, where earneſtly beholding her face, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering her actions, he did ſuſpect, that ſhe was neither mad, nor a man: He let this day paſſe ouer, and the next day hee was aſſured of both; In as much as ſo great a ſadnes could not bee fayned; And that <hi>Niſa's</hi> reſerued
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:14312:44"/>
ſpeech, and the modeſty of her lookes declared openly that which vpon other occaſions, ſhe had couered with ſo much care; <hi>Emilio</hi> being then perſwaded that this mad creature was a Woman, or at the leaſt hauing eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent tokens therof, inquired with great care of her ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes? vſing her as a Gentlewoman, and with reſpect due vnto her ſex. <hi>Niſa</hi> who had now neither care to diſguiſe herſelfe nor to liue, confeſſed ſhee was a woman, and would not be comforted by <hi>Emilio's</hi> wordes: But <hi>Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio,</hi> who the more hee conuerſed with her, the more was ingaged in her Loue; in the end ſuffered himſelfe to be vanquiſhed in her beauty: for <hi>Niſa</hi> now ceaſing to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare as a man captiuated all thoſe who beheld her, with her maruailous grace. Loue then began to make himſelfe maſter ouer <hi>Emilio</hi> through pitty, which is the cloake vnder which it entreth into our mindes; as the Pill vnder golde, that the bitternes may not offend: and his paſſion increaſed ſo farre, as to deſire to knowe her euill, and to procure her remedy. But neither for any effect of Loue, nor hope of remedy that hee could giue her, would <hi>Niſa</hi> witnes any feeling of pleaſure, or obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to him: all which ſerued to ſharpen <hi>Emilios</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, which hee did make appeare with greater demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations: whereat <hi>Niſa</hi> being grieued, endeauoured to diuert him from her Loue, coniuring him with teares, that hee would not leade her in this indecent habite. The Earle being curteous, offered her other cloathes, but ſhee aſſured him, that ſhe had made a vowe neuer to were any but Pilgrimes of this faſhion, vntill ſhe had ſeene the Patron of <hi>Spaine</hi> in <hi>Galicia. Emilio</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheles did make her one of Serge in the ſame <hi>Golle,</hi>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:14312:45"/>
for Serge, and Taylers are neuer wanting, fewe men comming into ſuch places, who doe not quickly proue Taylers. So the Pilgrim being new cloathed appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red more beautifull, there being no new apparell which doth not imbelliſh; nor ſo poore a habite new, which doth not inrich a well proportioned body.</p>
            <p>But by this time, a great fogge with a tempeſtious winde ariſing in the gulph, the Marryners knew by the ſignes, which are wont to fore-runne ſuch ſtormes, that they were likely to vndergoe a great hazard of drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Their preſage was not vaine, for the winde riſe with ſuch extremity and violence, and the Sea wrought with ſuch huge Billoes, that the Maſters could no more commaund, nor the Rowers abay. The Captaine was aſtoniſhed, the Pilot pale, ſome cryed, others ſilent and without ſtirring, remained as men in a Trance with feare. And in this confuſion, which continued ſixe houres, the miſerable Galley ſplit againſt the Rockes; <hi>Emilio</hi> who now no more remembred his Loue, and who knew not that the vnfortunatenes of <hi>Niſa</hi> brought forth this effect, (cleane contrary vnto <hi>Caeſars</hi> Fortune, which appeaſed ſtormes) indeauoured to ſaue his life with much trauaile: And the Heauen reſeruing <hi>Niſa's</hi> life to runne greater fortunes, caſt her as formerly ſhee had beene vpon the ſhore of <hi>Barcelon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thoſe which remained aliue, were caſt away in the ſame place: <hi>Niſa</hi> hauing ſtayed ſome time to recouer herſelfe after this fortune, went in Pilgrimage to <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelles:</hi> where one day viſiting the famous Temple of the Penitent, whome the Angels buryed in the Mountaine, where God gaue his Lawes to <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſhe ſawe a woman
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:14312:45"/>
a Pilgrim as herſelfe, though in other habite, who with great Deuotion was vpon her knees, at the ſtayres of the great Altar: Shee appeared vnto <hi>Niſa</hi> to bee a <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard,</hi> wherefore deſiring better to informe herſelfe, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged thereunto, by her loue vnto the Countrey, ſhee ſtayed at the Gate, whereat (when hauing done her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotions) ſhe came forth, and <hi>Niſa</hi> ſaluting her, they both knewe that they were <hi>Caſtelians:</hi> their ioy was ſo great, that it had beene confirmed by imbracings, if the mans apparell which <hi>Niſa</hi> wore, had not hindred it: by little and little they went apart, that they might ſpeake more freely, and with leſſe feare of the <hi>French,</hi> who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready began to behold their beauties: and being placed vnder a Rocke which was adioyning vnto the Sea, <hi>Niſa</hi> ſaid thus vnto her, of what Prouince are you faire <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard?</hi> of the Kingdome of <hi>Toledo</hi> (anſwered the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim) and of the greateſt Citty, hauing merited to lodge the Kings for many yeares: you are then of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreele,</hi> replyed <hi>Niſa,</hi> and ſo wee are heere met by chance two Pilgrims of one Countrey, for I am alſo of <hi>Toledo.</hi> Then ſaid the Pilgrim, fetching a great ſigh: There was borne the cauſe of my peregrination, and of my misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. It is eaſie to bee ſeene in thy youth and in thy beauty, that Loue hath brought you into theſe partes; and if it bee of a Gentleman of whome thou doſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine, I beleeue I know him. It may be ſo ſaid the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim of <hi>Madreele,</hi> and beleeue me ſo ſoone as I ſaw you I was abaſhed, becauſe you haue the very countenance of my enemy; you wiſh mee euill by all circumſtance, then ſaid <hi>Niſa:</hi> rather all good replyed the Pilgrim; for all that reſembleth his body is agreable vnto me, onely
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:14312:46"/>
I complaine of the cruelty of his minde; will you not tell me his name or his Parents, ſaid <hi>Niſa?</hi> I hazard a ſmall matter in telling thee that, anſwered ſhee; For contrariwiſe I gaine thus much, that it ſeemeth vnto me I am quiet and at peace, hauing ſeene thee, which ſince I loſt him neuer came vnto me before now. His name is <hi>Celio,</hi> and the name of a Siſter which he hath is <hi>Niſa,</hi> which are the beſt tokens I can giue thee, to make him known vnto thee; becauſe beſides, that ſhee is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for her beauty, ſhee is alſo more famous for her diſgrace. <hi>Niſa</hi> remained aſtoniſhed to heare her owne name, &amp; her brother <hi>Celios</hi> (for this Pilgrim was <hi>Finia, Pamphilus</hi> his Siſter, who had bin left in <hi>France,</hi> as you haue already heard) wherefore ſhe deſired earneſtly to know the particuler of this ſtory, which <hi>Finia</hi> related in the ſame ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner as <hi>Celio<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

her, that ſhe had knowne him at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where they had been both Slaues together: <hi>Finia</hi> burſting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to teares, imbraced <hi>Niſa,</hi> and coniured her to tell her name, and the ſtory of her Brother if ſhee knew it: <hi>Niſa</hi> anſwered, that <hi>Pamphilus</hi> himſelfe had heretofore in his captiuity tolde it vnto her, and that ſhe would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recount it vnto her: but firſt, ſhee deceiued <hi>Finia</hi> in telling her, that her name was <hi>Felix,</hi> and that going from <hi>Toledo</hi> with a Captaine, who imbarked in <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gena,</hi> they had beene made Captiues in paſſing to <hi>Oran,</hi> and afterwards had to <hi>Argier,</hi> where a Turke of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> had bought her.

               <p>But <hi>Pamphilus</hi> being one day at the Market place, he was knowne by a Marchant of <hi>Toledo,</hi> a great friend vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Niſa</hi> her Father, who going about to lay hands on him and apprehend him, <hi>Pamphilus</hi> was inforced to lay hand vpon his Sword, to defend himſelfe from the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.

their enemies blood; wherefore one morning from the watch Towers, the Bels and Trumpets giuing the alla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, incited by his owne generoſity, and with the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daines, wherewith <hi>Niſa</hi> in his opinon had diſgraced him three or foure dayes before, hee went forth armed at all points, hauing a red Scarfe vpon his left arme, a white Feather vpon his helme, and a mountaine of ſnowe vpon his Shield; from the top of which, as from Mount <hi>Gibell</hi> in <hi>Scicily</hi> came a mouth of fire.

               <p>The newes of this accident came ſpeedily vnto <hi>Niſa</hi> her eares, for the report of euill ſucceſſes come ſooner to the eares of Louers then that of happy euents: what her griefe was it is not neceſſary to expreſſe, otherwiſe then in repreſenting <hi>Niſa,</hi> farre from her Parents, out of her owne Countrey, and from any friends, and which was moſt, from the deare preſence of him, for whoſe ſake ſhee had quited all theſe, and for whoſe loſſe ſhee was almoſt out of her wits.

With theſe wordes; and with her beauty, <hi>Niſa</hi> grewe abſolute maſter of this <hi>Moore,</hi> of his women, (wherein they abound) of <hi>Lela Axa</hi> his Daughter, of his goods, his ſlaues, and his Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: vpon which, as ſhee rid vp and downe the Towne for her pleaſure, ſhe was almoſt adored by theſe Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians. She called herſelfe <hi>Azan Rubin,</hi> amongſt them, a name which <hi>Alijaffer</hi> had giuen her in memory of his Sonne, in whoſe place he accounted of her, ſaying that ſhee was his Portrature. Amongſt <hi>Alijaffers</hi> ſlaues, there was one <hi>Spaniard,</hi> with whom <hi>Niſa</hi> hauing many times ſpeech, ſhe intreated him, that he would inquire ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with whom a ſlaue of the Kingdome of <hi>Toledo</hi> liued;

and whoſe name was <hi>Pamphilus?</hi> This man informed himſelfe the ſame day; and following her, when ſhee was alone, he tolde her, that <hi>Saly Morato</hi> had taken him in a Battaile which was fought in <hi>Cent,</hi> and had him ſtill in his power, with other Slaues who ſerued the Maſons about the houſe, which he was building: <hi>Niſa</hi> glad of theſe newes, in the euening got on Horſebacke, Cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed in a Scarlet Caſque, layd about with golde Lace, hauing a Hat vpon her head imbroadered with Pearle, and a great Feather, and a rich Sword of <hi>Tunis</hi> hanging in a Scarfe by her ſide: In this manner ſhe went into the ſtreet, where <hi>Saly Morat</hi> dwelt; and ſawe (in a newe houſe which was there a building) her miſerable (but beloued <hi>Pamphilus,</hi> not yet fully healed of his wounds, hauing a poore dublet of courſe Canuas, &amp; breeches of the ſame, without ſhooes vpon his feet, &amp; carying with another Chriſtian, the materials wherewith that houſe was to be built; ſhe ſtayed not (as ſhe had thought) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that ſeeing him in this eſtate, the teares which ſhe ſhed, would haue diſcouered her; but feyning to turne her horſe in the ſtreet, &amp; the beams of her face properly reſembling them of the Sun) hau<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

Thou art then his ſlaue, ſaid ſhee, in the <hi>Caſtillian</hi> tongue. <hi>Pamphilus</hi> anſwered, that by his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune

he was brought to that eſtate, and earneſtly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding her face, let fall to the ground that which hee held in his hand. Wondering to ſee a Moore which ſhould ſo perfectly reſemble his beloued <hi>Niſa:</hi> for that this ſhould be ſhee, he could not perſwade himſelfe, by reaſon of her Language, her habite, and the ſmall time ſince that he left her in <hi>Cent:</hi> ſo hee remained without ſpeaking, indeuouring to couer his aſtoniſhment and confuſion by his ſilence: When as ſhee ſpeaking vnto him in the <hi>Arabian</hi> tongue, asked of him if hee were a Knight? <hi>Pamphilus</hi> more aſſured that it was <hi>Niſa,</hi> by the reſemblance of her face, &amp; diſtruſting it was not ſhe by her language, hearing her ſpeak the language of <hi>Feſſe</hi> ſo naturally, anſwered her. I told <hi>Saly Morato</hi> that I was a poore man, but becauſe you reſemble ſo much a Maſter which heretofore I had (vnto whom I neuer lied in my life) I will not deceiue you. I am a <hi>Caſtillian</hi> Knight, and of the Kingdome of <hi>Toledo,</hi> &amp; of a place, whereof it is not poſſible but you ſhould haue heard, becauſe that the names of Princes Courts are notorious to all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as <hi>Paris</hi> in <hi>France, Rome</hi> in <hi>Italy, Conſtantinople</hi> in <hi>Greece;</hi> and <hi>Madreele</hi> in <hi>Spaine;</hi> there was I borne, ſubiect vnto this misfortune wherein you ſee me.

hether, and to comfort himſelfe called me by the name of his ſonne; promiſing me to marry me vnto <hi>Lela Axa</hi> his Daughter, who is the fayreſt in all <hi>Affrique,</hi> and this is the reaſon which inciteth me to loue Chriſtians (who are well borne) becauſe my mother was one; eſpecially <hi>Spanyards</hi> and of her owne Country: and it greeues me extreamely that thou art belonging to this gouernor, who is reputed to vſe his ſlaues hardly, as it may be ſeen by experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in thy ſelfe, who being ſuch, that thy no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie doth manifeſtly appeere, notwithſtanding the miſery and pouerty of thy clothes, yet doth put thee to ſuch vile labor.

               <p>So being departed, <hi>Niſa</hi> told <hi>Alijaffer</hi> the deſire which ſhee had vnto a <hi>Spaeniſh</hi> ſlaue, who was euill entreated of <hi>Saly Morato;</hi> the <hi>Moor</hi> who deſired to oblige him abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, and to ſatiſfie his pleaſure in all things, went the next morning to <hi>Salye Morato;</hi> to treate with him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſale of this ſlaue; which being not refuſed vnto him, they talked of the price: <hi>Salye</hi> demaunded a thouſand Duckets, becauſe (ſayeth he) he had beene taken in good equipage, both for Armes and Horſe, and a red Scarfe vpon his left arme, a thing which (he ſayed) in the time of his being in <hi>Spayne</hi> he had ſeene in Kings Portratures: <hi>Niſa</hi> who was moſt intereſſed

               <p>This day paſſed away, followed with many others, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which time, they entred into deliberations of the meanes, whereby they might recouer their libertie; which ſeemed to them impoſſible in reſpect of the loue which <hi>Alijaffer</hi> bare vnto <hi>Niſa,</hi> as alſo in reſpect of the loue which <hi>Fatima</hi> bare vnto <hi>Pamphilus;</hi> for ſhe hauing heard that he would be a <hi>Moor</hi> &amp; that his Vncle would marry her vnto him, fauoured him, to <hi>Niſas</hi> great griefe who vpon this iealouſie, was for the ſpace of three mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths without any louing correſpondency with him: Behold an vnheardoff ſtory! wherein is to be ſeene what a woman (who loueth) can effect; ſeeing ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued the diſtruſt of an old <hi>Moore,</hi> and brought all his houſe to that poynt that all things were gouerned by the onely will of <hi>Pamphilus:</hi> who taking better coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, whileſt <hi>Alijaffer</hi> was gone vnto <hi>Tarndan</hi> where the King lay at that time; wrought ſo hanſomely, with <hi>Axa</hi> and <hi>Fatima,</hi> that they would goe into <hi>Spaine</hi> with him, vpon the remonſtrance, which he made vnto them, that his loue was certaine and aſſured, and theirs deceitfull, falſe and not to be beleeued: they were not hard to be

               <p>This <hi>Niſa</hi> added vnto the truth, to hide herſelfe from <hi>Finia,</hi> knowing already by that which was related in the firſt Booke, how ſhee and <hi>Pamphilus</hi> were both ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vp halfe Drowned, one by the Fiſhers, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Captaine <hi>Doricles,</hi> with their ſeuerall ſucceſſes in their Perigrinations in <hi>Spaine,</hi> vntill they met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther amongſt the Mad-men in the Hoſpitall of <hi>Valence.

               <p>In the meane time, miſerable <hi>Pamphilus</hi> ſuffered in Priſon, with more rigorous paine then he did before, becauſe that his fury increaſing with his griefe, hee was kept ſo much the more ſtraightly, by how much he was thought to bee the more mad.

had him to his houſe, ſaying that his Parents had ſent him Fiue hundred Crownes of <hi>Caſtreele,</hi> to defray the charge of his Cure at his houſe; All thoſe who remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Hoſpitall, were ſorry, becauſe vntill that time, there was neuer ſeene a Mad-man ſo wiſe, nor a wiſe man which did imagine ſo many follyes.

            <p>Theſe newes reuiued <hi>Niſa</hi> and <hi>Finia,</hi> who hauing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted themſelues there all that day, went the next day to ſee him in the Priſon; at the entrance whereof they found, that for a Mad-man hee was taken out and ſet vpon a Mule, to bee carryed to <hi>Valence.</hi> And euen vpon the inſtant, that <hi>Pamphilus</hi> lifting vp his eyes beheld his deare <hi>Niſa,</hi> and that ſhee aduanced herſelfe to ſpeake to him, came one of the ſeruants and apprehended <hi>Niſa,</hi> and his companions ceazing vpon <hi>Finia,</hi> put them both in Priſon: although <hi>Pamphilus</hi> cryed out that ſhe was his Brother, for being accounted for a Mad-man, hee was not hearkened vnto, but contrariwiſe becauſe he paſſionately caſt himſelf from his Mule vpon the ground; hee was with much cruelty tyed vpon his Mules backe, and with ſhrewde blowes ſet forward in his way; their opinion of his madnes being the more confirmed.</p>
            <p>I cannot forbeare wondring euery time I thinke of this mans misfortunes! hee came firſt to <hi>Barcelon</hi> to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer at <hi>Valence</hi> all thoſe miſeries which you haue former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heard. And now it ſeemeth, hee returneth that way againe a new to begin the ſame paines. The cauſe of <hi>Finia's</hi> and <hi>Niſa's</hi> apprehenſion, was that <hi>Niſa</hi> in regard of his apparell and of his ſhort hayre was thought to bee a man, and being alwayes in <hi>Finia's</hi> company, the Iuſtice tooke holde of them, out of a ſtrong ſuſpition
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:14312:56"/>
that they did liue lewdly and incontinently together, a thing which is often couered vnder the cloake of Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage, which makes it more odious, and frequent in that Countrey. Whatſoeuer might happen of it, <hi>Niſa</hi> would not diſcouer herſelfe notwithſtanding any feare of chaſtiſement: But defending her cauſe as a man, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed that euer ſhee had ſo much as ſpoken otherwayes then with great honeſty and modeſty to <hi>Finia.</hi> Who accounting <hi>Niſa</hi> for a man, and beleeuing certainely that ſhe was the ſame <hi>Felix,</hi> whom ſhee fained to bee, with whoſe conuerſation and beauty ſhe was charmed, confeſſed ſimply her deſire, (for the effect was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) and although the honeſty of their conuerſation did appeare by both their Confeſſions, yet their beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was a cruell witnes againſt their innocency.</p>
            <p>About this time came the afflicted <hi>(Celio</hi> by the mountaines of <hi>France,</hi> the principall Cittyes whereof he had ſought for his beloued <hi>Finia)</hi> backe to <hi>Barcelon,</hi> ſtill continuing his queſt, and onely to informe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe if there were any Pilgrims of <hi>Caſteele;</hi> and hauing vnderſtood that there were two Priſoners but a fewe daies before, he went to ſee them, hoping to heare ſome newes, if not of <hi>Finia,</hi> at leaſt of the Countrey. His for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune would that hee ſhould firſt meete with her before he ſawe his Siſter <hi>Niſa,</hi> and being aduertiſed, that ſhee had beene taken with a young man, and layd vp for the ſuſpition that was had of their diſhoneſt Loue, Hee ſpake vnto her through an Iron-grate, which ſeperateth the mens Priſons from the womens.</p>
            <p>Is this O <hi>Finia,</hi> the confidence which I had of thy vertue ſo conſormable to the noblenes of thy blood?
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:14312:56"/>
Is it heere, (after hauing ſearched thee almoſt all <hi>France</hi> ouer, hauing meaſured ſtep by ſtep all the teadious plaines, and craggy mountaines, which did leade vnto any place, where there was either hope or likelihood to finde thee, vndergoing many notable dangers) that I ſhould thinke to finde thee in a publicke Priſon with a young man? Now are all my ſuſpitions confirmed, and my reaſons that I had to kill the <hi>Frenchman,</hi> for which I haue ſuffered ſo many trauailes: Is this the recompence of ſo many euils, which for thy ſake I haue endured? Doeſt thou thus requite thy obligations vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mee? At the leaſt this comfort I haue, I may returne into my Countrey, with full aſſurance that I ſhall not incurre any infamy, neither in thy friends opinion nor in mine owne: for hauing left thee in this danger, and in thoſe which will vneuitably follow thee, ſeeing thou haſt found another, who accompanieth thee, honoreth thee, and defendeth thee. Thinke not, O vngratefull perſon, anſwered <hi>Finia</hi> in weeping, that I haue euer of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended thee, <hi>for thou canſt not make mee ſuffer ſo much,</hi> that I would hazard that which thou haſt coſt me, for all the treaſure of the world: Thy Iealouſie made thee kill a man and leaue me alone, in ſuch a place; the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of getting away from whence, conſidering my weakenes, may ſeeme a miracle. In my voyage I haue met with this man, who no leſſe innocent then chaſte <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> ſuffereth this vniuſt impriſonment, for hauing bin the moſt honeſt helper that I could haue deſired in thy abſence, as thou mayeſt plainely ſee by the modeſty of his countenance and his ſpeech, if thou pleaſeſt to ſpeake with him. To excuſe thy ſelfe anſwered <hi>Celio,</hi>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:14312:57"/>
in ſo notorious a crime, is to moue me to greater anger, becauſe thou mayſt haue fayled as a Woman, but to deny it vnto me, and to ſay that thou haſt not done it, is a moſt euident token that thou wilt deceiue mee, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heere or in thy owne Countrey, (if euer thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne thither) therefore I doe forbid thee for euer to dare to name me, or to ſay thou euer kneweſt me. So ſaid <hi>Celio,</hi> and turning his backe to <hi>Finia,</hi> left her in the greateſt griefe that a woman could ſuffer; which is in theſe accidents to looſe his preſence, vnder whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection ſhe liues: eſpecially when it ſeemeth vnto her, that ſhee cannot hope for any other remedy or ſuccour. <hi>Celio</hi> hiding the teares which hee ſhed in going away, and conſulting with the fury of his Iealouſie, and his rage for the iniury which he did thinke hee had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, concerning the reuenge which hee ſhould take; wayted for <hi>Niſa's</hi> inlargement, that he might kill him. The Iudges although that the Priſoners innocency did ſufficiently appeare, yet would they not giue them li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to returne together. (For thoſe doe ſeeme to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the euill, which doe not forbid the occaſion) but retired <hi>Finia</hi> into a houſe, and commanded <hi>Niſa</hi> whom they called <hi>Felix,</hi> that, that day hee ſhould voyde the Citty of <hi>Barcelon. Niſa</hi> went then late in the euening out of the Towne, and farre from thinking that her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wayted to kill her, beleeuing her to bee the man, with whom <hi>Finca</hi> had ſo irreconciliably offended him: And the darkenes of the euening with the diſguiſe of mans Apparell which <hi>Niſa</hi> wore, depriued <hi>Celio's</hi> eyes, (already blinded with anger) from diſcerning her to be his Siſter <hi>Niſa,</hi> into whoſe body hee twice thruſt his
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:14312:57"/>
Sword, and had abſolutely killed her, if ſome paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers vpon the way at that time, had not, not onely hindred him, but alſo apprehended him and put him in Priſon.</p>
            <p>The miſerable <hi>Niſa,</hi> who then began to haue a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter feeling of her ſufferred miſeries, was carryed to an honourable Cittizens houſe of great compaſſion and charity, who hauing giuen order for her Dreſſing, and found that her wounds were not mortall, purſued <hi>Celio</hi> ſo eagerly in Iuſtice, informing the Iudges of the crime which hee himſelfe had ſeene him commit, that the third day after he was condemned to Death. <hi>Celio</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in his defence, that <hi>Finia</hi> was his lawfull wife, and that hauing found her impriſoned with this young man for ſuſpition of incontinency, hee did not thinke that he had done euill, if hee had killed them both. Whereupon they ordered it, that <hi>Finia</hi> ſhould bee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned againe; but ſhee hauing ſome notice thereof, preuented it by flight.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, <hi>Pamphilus</hi> comming to <hi>Valence,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered his liberty by <hi>Iacinths</hi> meanes; with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame contentment vnto <hi>Tiberia,</hi> vnto whome <hi>Pamphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> giuing thankes, for the care which ſhee had of him, raiſed in her a thouſand hopes which his abſence, and miſery had killed. Hee taketh leaue of her with many fayre and amorous wordes, and returning to <hi>Barcelon,</hi> went to ſeeke for his Deare <hi>Niſa</hi> in the Priſon, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hee had ſeene her ſhut, when he went away as a Mad-man.</p>
            <p>But when he found <hi>Celio</hi> there in her place, in ſuch extreame danger of his life, from whome (informing
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:14312:58"/>
him of the cauſe of his misfortune) he was tolde all the iniury, which <hi>Finia</hi> had don him with a Pilgrim, whom he had wounded, whereby he came to knowe that this man, whome <hi>Celio</hi> out of Iealouſie would haue killed, was his owne Siſter <hi>Niſa.</hi> And with the griefe of ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy a newes, <hi>Pamphilus</hi> cryed out; O cruell <hi>Celio,</hi> thou haſt taken away the life of thy own Siſter, and my deare Wife, whome vnder this habit accompanied my For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes: and it may bee alſo my ſiſter <hi>Finia,</hi> for whoſe ſake thou haſt vniuſtly killed <hi>Niſa.</hi> I am <hi>Pamphilus</hi> thy enemy, vnto whome (not knowing of me) thou didſt recite the ſtory of thy Fortunes, who haue already par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned the iniury which thou haſt done vnto my ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in rauiſhing away <hi>Finia,</hi> hauing conſideration of the iniury which I did thee in leading away <hi>Niſa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With leſſe griefe would <hi>Celio</hi> haue heard the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of his Death, then the relation which <hi>Pamphilus</hi> made; for hee remayned ſo aſtoniſhed and ſilent, as if he had beene taken out of Priſon to goe to execution. Hee would haue iuſtified his innocency, but being not able to vtter one worde, hee remayned dumbe, and his hands and his feete without any motion, made him ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare as one vnſenſible. <hi>Pamphilus</hi> as almoſt mad, left him in the Priſon, and going vp and downe to enquire for <hi>Niſa,</hi> hee was accounted for a Mad-man by all thoſe who ſawe him, for they did remember that for a Mad-man hee was ſaued, being condemned to dye.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pamphilus</hi> hauing bene three or foure times at <hi>Iacinths</hi> houſe; Loue, to worke the greater confuſion, had aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented his Siſter <hi>Tiberia's</hi> deſires; who (as you haue heard) caſt her eyes vpon <hi>Pamphilus</hi> his beautie: hee

of <hi>Iberia,</hi> no leſſe rich and fruitfull then thoſe which of the ſame name are called <hi>Iberian,</hi> neare the Mountaine <hi>Caucaſas,</hi> hauing aboundance of Golde within their Veynes. This famous flood according vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Pliny,</hi> riſeth neare vnto the ancient <hi>Iuliobrica,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter many windings and turnings commeth to waſh the walles of <hi>Sallibinum,</hi> which <hi>Caeſar</hi> called <hi>Caeſar Auguſtus,</hi> and the iniury of times <hi>Saragoſſa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the courſe of theſe <hi>Chriſtaline</hi> waters, <hi>Pamphilus</hi> ſtayed his flight, ſitting downe vpon the bancke of the Riuer, which began to ſwell with his teares, ſo pittifull to behold, that the very windes did ſeeme to condole with him in his complaints by their dolefull noyſe, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the leaues of the Trees, and the Birdes warbling out their woes. There was not any thing of life, which had not ſome ſhewe of ſorrow with him, vnleſſe it were the Fiſhes, which being dumbe, did not put forth their heads out of their cleare waters at the importunity of other voyces, yet their ſilence did ſeeme to ioyne with him in ſorrow. Is it poſſible ſaid he, that the feare of looſing this vnprofitable Life, ſhould haue more power ouer me, then the duties which I owe, vnto my birth and vnto my Miſtres? How comes it to paſſe, that not to looſe a thing, ſo vile in my eyes, ſo heauy to my ſoule, and ſo grieuous to my ſuffering, I haue loſt the moſt eſteemed of my vnderſtanding, the moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored of my memory and the moſt adored of my will? It is thou faire <hi>Niſa,</hi> who ouer the ſharpe Mountaines of <hi>Toledo,</hi> didſt couragiouſly followe my ſteps, from their higheſt tops euen vnto the ſandes of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Sea: thou art ſhee, who in the Battaile of <hi>Cent</hi> didſt
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:14312:60"/>
bitterly bewayle my Captiuity: art not thou O my Deare <hi>Niſa</hi> ſhee, who vnder the habit of a <hi>Moore</hi> and vnder the name of <hi>Hazan Ruben,</hi> dreweſt mee from the Kingdome of <hi>Feſſe,</hi> and from the Captiuity of <hi>Sali Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rata?</hi> Wert not thou caſt away with me at Sea, in our returne from <hi>Italy</hi> within the view of <hi>Barcelon</hi> walles, and whom the Sea caſt vp on the ſhore, as vnworthy to poſſeſſe ſo rich a Pearle? Didſt not thou liue afterwards a long time amongſt the Mad-men as depriued of thy reaſon, with the very griefe of my Death? didſt not thou ſuffer new Shipwracke at <hi>Marſelles?</hi> And finally woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by thy iealous Brother lyeſt now in a ſtrange Countrey either ſicke or dead? Seeing all this is ſo, how can I apprehend the leaſt motion of leauing thee? Where is my courage or am I not <hi>Pamphilus</hi> of <hi>Luxan?</hi> Is this the vertuous blood of thoſe valiant Gouernors, who ſo nobly defended the walles of <hi>Madreele,</hi> from the <hi>Moores</hi> of <hi>Toledo?</hi> It is not poſſible! I am not my ſelfe, my misfortunes haue changed me into ſomething elſe. To bee in Loue and to be a Coward is a manifeſt contrariety: yet to deny that I Loue, is to ſay the Sun is darkenes, and the night Lightnes, eſpecially ſince I cannot ſay, but that I haue ſeene <hi>Niſa.</hi> But ſeeing I doe confeſſe that I haue ſeene her, how can I ſay but that I loue her? And if I loue her, how can I leaue her? And if I haue left her, wherefore doe I liue?</p>
            <p>So did <hi>Pamphilus</hi> accuſe himſelfe for hauing left <hi>Niſa</hi> for any danger; no more nor no leſſe, then as one who trauailing vpon the way remembreth ſomething of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance which he had forgotten at home, breaking off from his diſcourſe and from his company, turneth back
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:14312:60"/>
againe to his lodging, where hee thinkes he ſhall neuer come time enough; with the ſame haſt <hi>Pamphilus</hi> taketh his way back again to <hi>Barcelon,</hi> from which both in haſt and feare he had departed. A ſtrong chayne of Louers, which tyed to their deſired beauty, ſhortens it ſelfe by the force which lengthens it, vntill it returne vnto its centure. Beauty without doubt, which lifting vp the vapors of the Louers eyes, ſeemeth to drawe vnto its ſelfe the very waighty and earthy part, in deſpite of all reſiſtance made by the naturall waight, and as the Sun oftentimes conuerteth into burning beames, the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor which is concealed in the Clouds; ſo Beauty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerteth into fire all the teares and ſadneſſes of Louers.</p>
            <p>Fewe Leagues had <hi>Pamphilus</hi> iourneyed from the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Collony of the <hi>Romans,</hi> when as going downe a Hill, it being ſo late, as that the Sunne had left no light in the Weſt, but as it were a golden girdle; which inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roning the Horizon, did ſeeme as a Crowne vnto the neighbouring night: hee heard a voyce grieuouſly complaining in a Meadow, which ſhadowed with high Rockes, was very darke.</p>
            <p>The couragious Pilgrim went into it, and ſawe a man lying vpon the Graſſe, amongſt the Trees which were watered with a freſh Brooke, of whome demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the cauſe of his complaint; hee intreated him to come vnto him, if he deſired to knowe, before he yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vp his ſoule, cauſed by three mortall woundes which were made in his body. <hi>Pamphilus</hi> approached vnto him although with ſome diſtruſt, and lifting him vp leaned his head againſt a Tree. I am a Knight ſaid the wounded man; treacherouſly murthered by his
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:14312:61"/>
hands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who hath receiued moſt good turnes from mee. There is a Monaſtery in theſe fields which is not farre from hence, if thou canſt carry me vpon thy ſhoulders thither, thou ſhalt bee the <hi>Encas</hi> of my ſoule, and I the <hi>Anchiſes,</hi> ſaued peraduenture from the eternall Fire which I haue merited. <hi>Pamphilus</hi> layde downe his Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers ſtaffe (oh how hurtfull it is to leaue ones weapons vpon any occaſion whatſoeuer) taking him in his armes; And remembring that he had ſo carryed <hi>Iacinth;</hi> hee thought with himſelfe, that ſeeing he was come to carry others vnto the Graue, hee was not farre from thence himſelfe: and comforted himſelfe with this, that if he were not Death himſelfe, he was yet his Beere. So iourneying towards the Monaſtery, with the woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded man, who with broken ſpeaches interrupted, by his approaching Death, recited the cauſe thereof. The Pilgrim being come vnto the Gate, and ſeeing by the cleere light of the Moone, in the front thereof, the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of our Bleſſed Lady the Virgin; ſaid vnto the wounded man, that hee ſhould recommend his ſoule whileſt he knocked at the gate. At whoſe knocking the Porter being come, and informed by the Pilgrim of the accident, anſwered; tht with like diſſimulation, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Bandoleers of <hi>Iara,</hi> had one night robbed the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery, and for that cauſe hee could not open the gate, without the ſuperiours Licenſe. <hi>Pamphilus</hi> intreated him to diſpatch: but there being a long Garden be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Monaſtery and Cell, before he could return the Knight dyed in his armes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pamphilus</hi> looked pale, diſmayde with the accident, and almoſt as dead as he, and incouraging him to this
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:14312:61"/>
fearefull and ſharpe paſſage, layde a Croſſe of two Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle bowes vpon his ſtomacke. Inſtantly hee heard a troope of Horſe, whoſe maſters being diuided into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers paths, did ſeeke for the Dead man; By their words and their diligence, the Pilgrim knewe their deſigne, and calling them, ſhewed them him whom they ſought for, telling them how hee had found him. Amongſt them was his Brother, who ſeeing <hi>Pamphilus</hi> bloody, and in a Pilgrims habit (which is enough to make an honeſt man ſuſpected) cryed out, Oh thou <hi>Caſtillian</hi> traytor, thouhaſt murthered him to rob him. And at the very inſtant, the ſame friend who had killed this poore Knight, and who the better to couer his treaſon, accompanying the Brother, tooke holde of the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims arme; thou robber &amp; infamous aſſaſſiuator, what hath made thee murther the nobleſt Knight which was in this Countrey? Sirs replyed <hi>Pamphilus,</hi> I found him in a Meadow hard by, bewayling his death, which hee ſaid was wrought by the hand of one whome he did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt his beſt friend: and out of compaſſion and at his intreaty, I brought him to this Monaſtery, where he departed this life in my armes. But <hi>Tanſiles</hi> (who was this Traytor which had killed him) fearing leaſt the Pilgrim might diſcouer ſomething, which hee might haue heard from the dying man concerning his treaſon, pulling out a Piſtoll from the pommell of his ſaddle, gaue fire and aymed it directly at his head. Yet Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen not permitting that it ſhould goe off (for Saintes and Angels doe alwayes aſſiſt the innocent) the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim liued. O let him liue ſaid <hi>Tirſus,</hi> (ſo was the dead mans brother called) for it is much better, that keeping
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:14312:62"/>
him in Priſon, hee may confeſſe his owne crime: and whether he killed him for to rob him, or whether ſome enemy of my Brother <hi>Godfreyes</hi> did not hyer him to murther him. The traytor anſwered to <hi>Tirſus,</hi> and to the others who did accompany him, that blood (yet warme) of his friend would not ſuffer him to delay his reuenge ſo long. Yet all their opinions preuailing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his; the innocent <hi>Pamphilus</hi> was bound hand and foot vpon a Horſe, and dead <hi>Godfrey</hi> laid vpon another. It is a iuſt Iudgment ſaid <hi>Pamphilus,</hi> (by the way) for my leauing of <hi>Niſa</hi> wounded, and <hi>Iacinth</hi> almoſt dead. Doe you not heare ſaid <hi>Tirſus?</hi> without doubt this <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa</hi> is the woman for whoſe ſake he hath committed this murther, and <hi>Iacinih</hi> ſome friend, who led my Brother to the place. All of them beleeued what <hi>Tirſus</hi> ſaid, and the traytor <hi>Tanſiles</hi> iuterpreted <hi>Pamphilus</hi> his diſpaires in ſuch ſort, that euery one beleeued that <hi>Pamphilus</hi> did ſpeake of <hi>Godfreys</hi> death.</p>
            <p>They led him into no Towne, as hee thought they would, but vnto a Grange houſe, about halfe a League from the Monaſtery, the gate whereof was betweene two Towers. <hi>Tirſus</hi> knocketh, and a ſeruant anſwering: tell my Mother &amp; Siſters (ſaid he) that I haue brought my brother <hi>Godfrey</hi> dead, and his murtherer with him. Inſtantly hee heard a great cry in the Hall of the houſe, by which <hi>Pamphilus</hi> did knowe that Fortune prepared a great deale of euill for him: Neuertheles deſiring to Dye, he reſolued not to defend his life with his tongue, which he could not doe with his armes. One opens the doore of the houſe, and with Candles lighted, the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Mother, with her Daughters and ſeruants recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:14312:62"/>
her dead Sonne. Some howling and crying carried him into the Hall, others ranne vpon poore <hi>Pamphilus,</hi> tearing his Beard and pulling him by the hayre of the Head, and almoſt aſtonied him with blowes. With this good entertainment, hee was lodged this night in one of the Towers, hauing his body loaden with Irons, yet he was heard vtter no wordes, but onely that he deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued this and more for forſaking <hi>Niſa.</hi> All this night nothing was heard but cryes and complaints for <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey,</hi> and the time which was not imployed in this Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall exerciſe, they ſpent in talking of <hi>Niſa</hi> and what ſhee ſhould be, whome their Priſoner had ſo often in his mouth.</p>
            <p>The light of the morning which very ſlowely enters into Priſons, brought day vnto <hi>Pamphilus,</hi> not in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him who had not ſlept, but in aduertiſing his ſoule of his approaching Death, the certaine newes whereof he would willingly haue welcomed with guifts: when as the Priſon doore being open, hee ſawe <hi>Godfreys</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Siſters enter, demaunding of him in great paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and choller, wherefore hee had killed her Sonne? but he anſwering, onely for <hi>Niſa's</hi> ſake am I reduced vnto this miſery, they began to beate him with ſuch rage, that they left him almoſt dead; and ſhutting the Priſon, they reſolued to famiſh him to Death. But whileſt about noone, the dead body was carryed to Buriall, with Lights, Mourning, and Funerall compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his Parents &amp; friends: <hi>Flerida</hi> his yongeſt Siſter, mollified with <hi>Pamphilus</hi> complaints, were it that his countenance did inforce her to beleeue his innocency, or that ſome other ſecret ſimpathy inclined her to haue
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:14312:63"/>
pitty of his life: went vnto the Priſon, and by the hole of the locke, ſayd thus vnto him: vnfortunate Pilgrim, doe not afflict thy ſelfe, for I will free thee in deſpite of my mother and my brothers; who art thou ſayde <hi>Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus</hi> who promiſeſt life when there is nothing but hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen which can giue it me? I am <hi>Flerida</hi> (anſwered ſhee) one of <hi>Godfreys</hi> Siſters who doe promiſe it vnto thee, afflicted with thy griefe, out of the aſſurance I haue in my owne imagination of thy innocency.</p>
            <p>I ſweare vnto thee by God ſaid <hi>Pamphilus,</hi> that going in the night through a Meadowe, I found thy brother wounded vnto death, as he tolde me by one whome he did reccon to be his beſt friend; I tooke him vpon my ſhoulders, and caryed him vnto the Monaſtery, where he dyed in my armes before the Gate was opened: I do not deſire to liue, but the care which I haue of anothers life more then mine owne, makes me ſeeke my libertie contrary to my deſire; If thou canſt procure me it, I am a Knight, and of a family, from which vngratefull man nor Traytor euer ſprang: thou ſhalt doe a heroique deed worthy of an illuſtrious Lady, &amp; though I ſhould neuer merrit it, yet heauen will not fayle to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it. <hi>Flerida</hi> had not need of ſo many reaſons, who was vertuous, and ſo well diſpoſed to free him, that ſhe would hazard a thouſand liues to giue it vnto him. And (as aptly it ſerued) thoſe which were gone to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company her brothers body to the Graue, not being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to returne ſpeedily (aſwell in regarde of the diſtance of the place, as in reſpect of the pompe of the Funerall, which laſted nine dayes) gaue her oportune meanes to open the plankes on the top of the Priſon, thereby let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

him downe ſome vittailes: All her other Siſters, her Mother, and the ſeruants onely entred to torment him, they ſeeing him liue, not knowing wherewith he did ſuſtaine himſelfe; anger, indignation, and crueltie, increaſed ſo far in them, that they reſolued to kill him, before <hi>Tirſus</hi> his returne from the Obſequies of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: But <hi>Flerida</hi> the ſame night gaue him ſuch ſtrong Fyles, that the Fetters, Staples and Lockes, being cut aſunder, and he being faſtned vnto a corde, ſhe drewe him vp by that hole which ſhe had made, by remouing the planke; &amp; all the houſhold being in their dead ſleep, ſhe opened the Gates: afterwards, with honeſt imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cings, ſhedding ſome teares, &amp; with many Iuels which ſhe did conſtraine him to take, ſhe was departing from him, when he caſting himſelf at her feete, with the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt wordes hee could ſpeake, promiſing to repay her this good turne with an immortall remembrance; and if that euer ſhe had occation to come into <hi>Caſteele,</hi> ſhe ſhould enquire for a Knight of <hi>Madreele</hi> called <hi>Pamphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> of <hi>Luxan,</hi> that ſhe might be aſſured ſhe ſhould not returne without due thankes and acknowledgements for ſo perfect an Obligation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pamphilus</hi> knowing that to proceede further in the queſt of <hi>Niſa,</hi> was to reſiſt the will of heauen, which had oppoſed him in it with ſo many rigorous ſucceſſes, went vnto <hi>Saragoſſa;</hi> reſoluing from thence to trauell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Caſteele.</hi> If thou didſt not poſſeſſe O <hi>Niſa</hi> (ſayd he vnto himſelfe as he went along) all my thought, and if thou didſt not holde as much place in my body, as my ſoule doeth, which is all in euery parte; who would doubt, but <hi>Flerida</hi> ſhould be now Miſtris of my will? O how
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:14312:64"/>
powerfull are good turns in apt occaſions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſeeing that the firmenes of Loue, which could not be moued with ſuch paynefull trauells, ſuch fearefull ſhipwracks, and with ſuch cruell Captiuities and impriſonments, with one good turne alone in an opportune time, is ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, if not maſtered; at leaſt the roofe, if not the walles; and although the foundation bee firme, yet the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes and other ornaments doe ſhake: Let not thoſe which ſhall heare this be diſpleaſed with him; for this was not ſo much a change from the Loue of <hi>Niſa,</hi> as a feeling of <hi>Flerida's</hi> goodwill: and as there is no body ſo ſolide, which the Sunne ſometime doth not pierce; ſo there is no Loue ſo firme, but that the firſt motions thereof may ſhake.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pamphilus</hi> ſo by long trauaile came vnto <hi>Saragoſſa,</hi> and would not enter into it before it was darke night, for feare hee might be followed or met by ſome one whome he knewe: and very earely in the morning de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from thence, and by vn-vſed pathes, from pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture to paſture, and from mountaine to mountaine, he endeauoured to ſhun the great high way, fearing that <hi>Flerida's</hi> Brother might make purſuite after him. In the end wearyed with the ſharpnes of the Mountaines, and the auſterity of the life, which he was conſtrayned to leade, hee reſolued one night to lye in ſome place where he might be better accommodated then in theſe Deſerts, and entring into a Citty which diuideth the two Kingdomes, hee enquired for a Lodging, But no body being willing to entertaine him, ſeeing him ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilly apparelled, his feete bloody, his face tanned, his hayre knotted &amp; ſhagged: he went vnto the Hoſpitall,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:14312:64"/>
the laſt refuge of miſery. <hi>Pamphilus</hi> found the gates o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen at that time, but without light, &amp; asking the cauſe, he was tolde, that in regard of a ſtrange noyſe which euery night was there heard, which hath happened e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſince the Death of a ſtranger who came thether to Lodge, no body hath dwelt there; yet hee might (as they ſaid) enter in if he would, for he ſhould find there a man of holy life in a little Chappell, who indured for the honour of God all thoſe illuſions, and who would ſhew him a place where he might lye without danger. <hi>Pamphilus</hi> then entred into a darke obſcure place, and after ſome fewe ſteps he might ſee a great way off, a dim light of a Lampe, vnto which place hee addreſſed himſelfe, and called the holy man: What wouldſt thou haue thou wicked Spirit, anſwered the holy man? Thou doeſt miſtake mee ſaid <hi>Pamphilus,</hi> I am a Pilgrim, who doe endeauour to ſeeke a lodging for this night. Then he opened the doore, where <hi>Pamphilus</hi> ſawe a man of a middle ſtature and age, with a long Beard and hayre, a Gowne of courſe rugge downe vnto his anckles, the Chappell was little, and Altar venerable, the baſſe whereof did ſerue him for his Bed: hee had a Stone for his pillowe, his Staffe for his companion, and a Deaths head for his looking-glaſſe.</p>
            <p>How durſt thou come into this place, ſaid hee vnto the Pilgrim, did no man aduertiſe thee of the diſquiet Lodging which is heere? I haue beene tolde it anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Pilgrim, but I haue ſuffered ſo much Labour in my trauailes, ſo much Cruelty in impriſonments, ſo many heauy misfortunes and colde entertainments, that no diſquiet can be newe vnto mee.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:14312:65"/>
The poore man then lighted a Candle at the Lampe, which burned before the Altar, and without ſaying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing commaunded the Pilgrim to followe him; he went through a Garden, which lay wilde as a Foreſt or wildernes, where hauing ſhewed him a part of the houſe, amongſt ſome <hi>Cypres</hi> Trees hee vnlocked the doore of a Chamber, and ſaid vnto him, ſeeing thou art young and accuſtomed to trauailes, enter heere: make the ſigne of the Croſſe and bee not diſmayde nor aſtoniſhed but ſleepe; <hi>Pamphilus</hi> taketh the Candle, and ſetting it vpon a ſtone which lay there, biddeth his Hoſt good night and ſhutteh the doore.</p>
            <p>There was a Bed in the Chamber good enough to reſt vpon, eſpecially for a man who hath layne ſo many nights vpon the ground: this inuited him to vncloath himſelfe, and taking one of the ſhirts which <hi>Flerida</hi> at his departure had giuen him, he put it on, and went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it. Hardly had he reuolued in his imagination, the confuſion of his life, a thing which often (the body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at reſt) is repreſented vnto the minde, when as ſleep which is truely called the Image and brother of Death, poſſeſſed his ſences with that force, which doth accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomably vſe vnto weary Pilgrims. All that part, which the Sunne abandoneth when it goeth downe vnto the <hi>Indyes</hi> was in a deepeſilence, when as the noyſe of ſome Horſes awaked <hi>Pamphilus,</hi> he thought he was <hi>ſtirring</hi> (as it many times happeneth vnto Trauailers) and that his bed did moue as a Ship or a Horſe, which did carry him. Neuertheles remembring that hee was in the Hoſpitall, and the cauſes for which it was vnhabitable; he opened his eyes, he ſawe Horſemen enter by two
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:14312:65"/>
and two into the Chamber, who lighting Torches which they had in their handes at the Candle which he had left burning by him, they caſt them againſt the ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Chamber, where they ſtucke faſt with their bottomes vpward and their tops downwards, which dropped downe burning flames vpon his bed, and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his clothes: He couereth himſelfe aſwell as poſſibly he could, leauing a litle hole to looke out that he might ſee whether his bed did burne or no; when as inſtantly he ſawe the flames out, and that vpon a Table which was in the corner of the Chamber, foure of them were at Primero, they paſſed, diſcarded, and ſet vp money as if they had truely playde: ſo long till at length they debating vpon a difference, they fell into quarrell in the Chamber, which made ſuch a noyſe with claſhing of Swords, that the miſerable <hi>Pamphilus</hi> called vpon (for helpe) our Lady of <hi>Gadalupe,</hi> which was onely left (of all the ſhrynes in <hi>Spaine)</hi> vnuiſited, although it were in his owne Country of <hi>Toledo.</hi> Becauſe holy places neare vnto one, are many times left vnuiſited out of a hope, which is had, that they might bee viſited at any time. Neuertheles the clattering of the ſwordes and all other noyſe, for the ſpace of halfe an houre ceaſed, and he was all of a ſweat out of the very feare he had; yet now well ſatisfied to ſee himſelfe in their abſence at ſome reſt, not thinking that they would come againe, when inſtantly hee felt that the bed and the clothes were pulled away from him by the outtermoſt corners: and he ſawe at the ſame time, a man come in with a Torch in his hand lighted, followed by two others, the one with a great braſen Baſon, and the other ſharpening a little Knife.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:14312:66"/>
Then began hee to tremble, and all his hayre ſtood an end, he would haue ſpoken but he was not able, when they were neere him, he who held the Torch put it out, and <hi>Pamphilus</hi> thinking that they would kill him, and that the Baſon was to receiue his blood, put his handes forth againſt the knife, and felt that they laide hold on him; hee gaue a great cry, &amp; the Torch inſtantly kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led againe: and he ſawe himſelfe betweene two Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiffe dogs, who held him faſt in their teeth. <hi>Ieſus</hi> cryed out <hi>Pamphilus,</hi> at which name all theſe fanſtaſticke illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions vaniſhed away, leauing him ſo weary and ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted with their company, that hee would not ſtay there any longer: but going out into the Garden by which he was entred, he went vnto the Chamber of the good Hermite, who ſeeing him ſo pale, weake and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, opened him the doore, and ſaid vnto him; haue your Hoſts heere giuen you an euill nights Lodging? So ill ſaid <hi>Pamphilus,</hi> that I haue not reſted all night, and yet I haue left them my clothes to pay for it. The good man receiued him aſwell as he could; telling him how many others with like ſucceſſe had beene ſo vſed, and many other diſcourſes, wherewith he paſt away the night vntill morning.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who doe not knowe the nature, quality, and condition of Spirits, will accompt of this hiſtory as a fable: wherefore I doe not thinke it vnfit to aduertiſe them, that there are ſome, fallen from the loweſt Quire of Angels, who out of the Eſſentiall paines, which is the Eternall priuation from the ſight of God, ſuffer leſſe pains then the other, as not hauing ſo much ſinned. And thoſe are of ſuch Nature that they cannot much
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:14312:66"/>
hurt men, but doe take pleaſure to diſpleaſe them; with frightings, noyſes, rumours, ſubtilties, and ſuch like o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinges, which they doe in the night in houſes, which thereby they make altogether vnhabitable, not being able otherwayes to hurt but by theſe fooliſh and ridiculous effects, limitted and bound, by the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty power of God. Theſe the <hi>Italians</hi> call <hi>Fayries,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards Elues,</hi> and the <hi>French Hobgoblins;</hi> of whoſe mockery and ſports <hi>William Totan</hi> ſpeaketh, in his Book of <hi>Warre</hi> of Deuils, calling them Deuils of the leſſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Hierarchy.

            <p>The light of the Day, which is the amiable and illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious Daughter of Heauen, and the onely guide of Mortals, did ſufficiently aſſure <hi>Pamphilus,</hi> that now he neede not any more to feare the euill infeſtings of the Spirits: then waking this good man, they both riſe, and went together vnto the Chamber, where <hi>Pamphilus</hi> lay: but entering in to ſee the ſtirre that was made the laſt night, they found the bed, <hi>Pamphilus</hi> clothes, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinges in the ſame place where they had layde, without any appearance that they had beene ſtirred. Whereat <hi>Pamphilus</hi> being aſhamed, with haſt made
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:14312:67"/>
himſelfe ready without ſpeaking a word, and thinking that this good Hermit would account him for a great Lyer, and a man of weake courage, departed from him, and thence tooke his way towards <hi>Gadalupe</hi> without once daring to turne his head towards the Citty, vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnto himſelfe, neuer to come into it againe vpon any occaſion whatſoeuer ſhould happen, if he were not aſſured to finde his <hi>Niſa</hi> there.</p>
            <p>There are two Hilles in the confines of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of <hi>Morena,</hi> which as two ſtrong walls doe inuiron the Towne and Monaſtery of <hi>Gadalupe,</hi> with ſo many Fountaines which doe runne from the Rockes into the bottome of the Valley, ſo much Fruit and ſo much graine of all ſorts, that it ſeemeth Nature knowing that which ſhould happen, had deſtined this place from the beginning of the world, to build this Pallace to the Princeſſe of Heauen. The Pilgrim being come thether, and hauing adored the Virgin, viſited the Temple, and payed his vowe: as hee went backe againe downe the ſtayres, at that time of the yeare when as the Sunne is equally diſtant betweene the two Poles; he met a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger going towards the Temple, who earneſtly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding him, asked him, if he had not knowne either there or in any other place, a Pilgrim of <hi>Madreele</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Pamphilus,</hi> who lately was in <hi>Arragon. Pamphilus</hi> troubled with this demaund, and fearing that hee was ſought after with ſome warrant from the Iuſtice, for <hi>Godfreys</hi> death, turned back and fled towards the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; But the <hi>Aragoniſe</hi> by ſome tokens which were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him, and by his ſodaine flying, preſuming that it was he, followed him and curteouſly calling him, ſaid,

My Brothers being returned and miſſing thee in the Priſon where they had left thee, witneſſed more ſorrowe for thy departure, then for my brother <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freys</hi> death. But a fewe dayes after, a woman of the Countrey falling out with another, amongſt other wordes, (which choller prouoked, a thing ordinary a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt women) ſaide ſhee was the cauſe of <hi>Godfrey</hi> his Death. Being thereupon taken, and hauing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed that <hi>Tanſiles</hi> killed him out of Iealouſie, hee was apprehended, and the cryme being verified, the third day after he had his Head cut off. My Mother and my Brother being now aſſured of thy Innocency, doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayle their hard vſage towards thee, and haue made great ſearch to finde thee.

               <p>The Pilgrim wondred at <hi>Tanſiles</hi> ſtrange ſucceſſe, and was ſomething moued in his minde with <hi>Flerida's</hi> louing deſires: But fearing to offend <hi>Niſa,</hi> hee ſatisfied the Meſſenger aſwell as hee could, giuing him the Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els which <hi>Flerida</hi> had giuen him, intreating that he would ſecretly deliuer them; together with a moſt kinde Letter vnto her, which hee preſently writ, and ſo the ſame day diſpatched away the Meſſenger, who went his way very ioyfull that he had in ſo ſhort a time ſo happily diſpatched his buſines: For <hi>Flerida</hi> not thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king he could eaſily finde him, had commaunded him to ſearch him, in euery houſe where Pilgrims were vſed to Lodge throughout all <hi>Spaine.</hi> I doe heere remember that I heard <hi>Pamphilus</hi> ſay, after he had retired himſelfe to couert from the ſtorme of his Fortunes, that hee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in all his life, found any thing ſo difficult, as to reſiſt <hi>Flerida's</hi> deſire, for beſides the obligations wherein hee ſtood tyed, which were very great and no leſſe then for his life, ſhee was moſt perfectly fayre; yet he continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his louing friendſhip by Letters, not onely with her, but with her Brothers alſo, vntill that ſhee being Marryed with a Knight of <hi>Andaluzia</hi> was carryed into the <hi>Indyes.</hi>

               <p>But <hi>Pamphilus</hi> hauing other diſcourſes in his head, went vnto him, and wiſhing health vnto him, (which hee could not obtaine for himſelfe) and curteouſly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine ſaluted by the Shepheard, who hauing nothing that ſauoured of ruſticknes but his Apparell, made him knowe in a fewe reaſons his vnderſtanding; and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther quickly diſcerned in the Pilgrim, that he had more neede of meate, then diſcourſe. Wherefore getting fire out of two Lawrell ſtickes, which for that purpoſe hee carryed with him, they poorely fed of that which <hi>Fabio</hi> (for ſo was this Shepheard called) had willingly dreſſed, the ground ſeruing them for a Table, the graſſe for napkins, and bubling Brookes for their drinke and muſique, They paſſed away the beſt part of the day in telling their aduentures: and when it grewe night, they retired themſelues into a little Village, whether <hi>Fabio</hi> led <hi>Pamphilus</hi> to keepe his maſters Oxen, who was a Farmer of a Grange which <hi>Niſa</hi> her Father had in the Mountaines. <hi>Pamphilus</hi> was glad of this condition, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping that by this meanes he might with time haue newes of his Miſtres, by the way <hi>Pamphilus</hi> intreated <hi>Fabio</hi> to relate the cauſe of his retiring into this place,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:14312:69"/>
who although that this requeſt brought vnto his mind a great deale of griefe and paſſion, yet after ſome ſighes he ſhortly tolde him, that hee was borne in <hi>Biſcay,</hi> and diſcended of moſt noble Parents, who were carefull to fit him in his youth, with quallities anſwerable vnto his Birth, wherein he profited ſo well, that he neither rayſed diſcontentment in his Parents nor ſhame vnto his Tutors; but after growing more ripe in yeares, and incited with the couragious heate of youth. In thoſe times, when the <hi>Engliſh</hi> with their warlike Ships rauaged alongſt our Coaſts, aſwell of <hi>Spaine</hi> as the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,</hi> and oftentimes with their deſperate reſolutions, made themſelues maſters of our <hi>Indian</hi> Golde, I put my ſelfe to Sea in one of the Kings Armadoes, aſwell with an intent to gaine honour by my valour, as experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in thoſe ſeruices, thereby to bee the abler to ſerue my Countrey, wherein I was ſo fortunate, (becauſe I will not ſay too much) that I got commaund my ſelfe, and by taking and executing two or three of thoſe Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats, was in a faire way both of grace with the King, and renowne in the world, when my eyes were the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whereby the moſt excellent and admirable beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Albiana</hi> captiuated my heart, ſo powerfully, that all other courſes ſet apart, I was inforced to giue my ſelfe wholly to her ſeruice, wherein after ſome ſmall time, I had ſo happy a progreſſion, that ſhee did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe ſhe was obliged by my perſeuerance, and by the opinion which the world held of me, to eſteeme of mee and of my ſeruice: thus happily in her fauour I ſpent ſome time, vntill it fortuned ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſlaues which I had, endeauouring to make an eſcape, but by my Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:14312:69"/>
and Marryners preuented, I inflicted a cruell pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment vpon them, bound thereunto by that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon pollicy which exacteth from Maſters, a ſeueere hand ouer their mutinous Slaues; eſpecially I vſed it towards one, who more eminent then the reſt, aſwell in regard of his perſon, as that hee was a cheefe author of their attempt, which <hi>Albiana</hi> with moſt earneſt prayers vnto me ſought to diuert, were it out of a pittifull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, ordinary in moſt women, or that ſhe tooke any ſpeciall liking vnto him: But I hauing more care at that time to execute my rage, then mindefull of her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, (which I did not thinke would haue turned to that conſequence) for example ſake, which as it is powerfull, ſo is it moſt neceſſary, eſpecially amongſt men of our profeſſion, who ſerue our ſelues with multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of them, perſeuered in hauing him ſoundly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. Whereat ſhee diſcontented, though with lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſhew thereof, vnder-hand wrought ſuch meanes by her friends in Court, before I imagined any ſuch thing, that the Slaue was by meſſenger from the Duke of <hi>Ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> and by warrant vnder the Kings hand fetched from me, and the next day ſhee did let me knowe that any denyall to a Woman, effects her hatred; For ſhee ſent me a Letter wherein ſhe ſaid, I was a cruell Monſter, and that ſhe was ſo farre from Louing and eſteeming me, that ſhe would euer hate my barbarous Nature, and ſhe wondred, that any valour could bee lodged where cruelty had ſuch a habitation; to conclude ſhee tolde me, that I ſhould neuer come in her ſight, nor be where ſhe might heare of my name. How grieuous this was vnto me gentle Sir, may eaſily be geſſed if you
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:14312:70"/>
knewe the extremity of my Loue, which was ſo much that I preſently without the knowledge of any of my friends tooke ſuch order, as I could with my command, and retired my ſelfe into theſe Deſert places, where I am reſolued vnder this diſguiſed habite to end my dayes; ſeeing that <hi>Albiana</hi> will haue it ſo, who whether her complaints were iuſt or no, or whether they but ſerue to colour her vnconſtancy, ſhall bee alwayes lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and truely obayed by me, vnto whome onely this comfort is left, That though Life hath left me, Death will take me.</p>
               <p>Before <hi>Fabio</hi> had finiſhed this ſhort diſcourſe, they had diſcouered the Village, where <hi>Alfeſibus</hi> did keepe <hi>Niſa's</hi> fathers Cattell, in the beſt houſe of the Village, which for a Countrey houſe was a faire one, <hi>Alfeſibus</hi> receiued <hi>Pamphilus,</hi> and informed by <hi>Fabio</hi> of his intent, he agreed with him for wages; and after an euill ſupper and a worſe Lodging, hee paſſed the night miſerably. And when morning appeared, <hi>Pamphilus</hi> went after his Oxen vnto the ſolitary Fields, where hee liued ſome time free from the confuſed noyſes of the Citties, a good leaſure to meditate vpon his aduentures.</p>
               <p>In the meane time <hi>Niſa</hi> healed of her woundes, knew that ſhe had receiued them from her owne Brother, out of Iealouſie which hee had conceiued againſt her for <hi>Finia.</hi> And intreating his good Hoſt that hee would haue pitty vpon her blood, by both their meanes his pardon and liberty was obtained, the one ſoliciting, and the other forbearing the proſecution. One of the woundes which <hi>Niſa</hi> had receiued was in her left ſide, and as in the Dreſſing it could not be auoyded, but that
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:14312:70"/>
ſhee was knowne to bee a Woman, although ſhe had coniured her Hoſt to keepe it ſecret from his Family, yet it was impoſſible: Becauſe that his Sonne <hi>Theſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> vnhappily one day was at her dreſſing and tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſo into his minde the woundes which ſhee had in her body, that within a fewe dayes, hee fell ſicke by force of this continuall thought, not being able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue into his imagination any thought, but the deſire of this beauty. For all the heauen of Loue, moueth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe two poles, Imagination, and Deſire. And then his body is as full of imaginary and fantaſticke figures, as the Aſtrologians Globe. <hi>Theſander</hi> did all that he could to diuert himſelfe from this thought, and as euils are healed by their contraries, hee propoſed vnto his eyes other obiects, and other cares vnto his imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: But as Art is made out of many experiences, which were wanting vnto <hi>Theſander,</hi> hee rather found the euill then the remedy. For it is impoſſible that young men ſhould knowe much, becauſe that to bee wiſe requires experience, and that is gotten with time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Niſa</hi> was much grieued at <hi>Theſanders</hi> paſſion, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though hee had neuer ſpoken vnto her about it.

By this meanes ſhe ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the Father: But the poore <hi>Theſander</hi> was ſo deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, that falling into greater extremity, hee was at the laſt point of his life; like vnto Trees whoſe boughes doe not looſe their greenenes, vntill that their humour which doth quicken them doe abſolutely fayle, becauſe that hope is the radicall moyſture which doth keepe vs aliue, and is vnto vs as Oyle vnto our fire. <hi>Niſa</hi> ſeeing that <hi>Theſander</hi> was for her ſake vpon the point of loſing his life, and ſhee herſelfe, had not now liued, but out of his Fathers pitty, was exceedingly perplexed, that ſhee could not ſatisfie ſo iuſt an obligation: and not being able to reſt in theſe confuſed thoughts, the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Pamphilus</hi> labours did alwayes appeare in her minde, who ſhe thought to be Priſoner ſtill at <hi>Valence. Theſanders</hi> euill increaſed, <hi>Niſa</hi> deferred the remedy, &amp; the Father accuſed this poore amorous man, in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion innocent, becauſe, that in thinges naturall, we doe neither merit nor Demerit: In briefe, all the whole

               <p>Amongſt all the variable Fortunes aſwell by Land as Sea, which our Pilgrim had ſuffered, there was none ſo difficult vnto her as this. Neuertheles ſhee reſolued to entertaine <hi>Theſander,</hi> vntill hee had recouered ſome ſtrength, that thereby he might the better bee able to beare the ſubtilty which ſhee intended. And in this ſhe did not deceiue herſelfe, for our ſpirits, haue ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance with the nature of young Horſes, which are eaſilyer managed with gentle Bits then with hard; The ſweet wordes, the fained hopes, and imbracings of <hi>Niſa</hi> within few dayes reſtored <hi>Theſanders</hi> weakened ſpirit, during which time, <hi>Celio</hi> was deliuered out of Priſon, with an exceeding deſire to ſee her, aſwell becauſe hee had heard newes of her health, as becauſe he imagined, that if <hi>Finia</hi> were not in her company, yet at the leaſt he might heare ſome newes of her. Neuertheles the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull <hi>Niſa</hi> beleeuing that <hi>Celio</hi> deſired to kill her, not knowing what <hi>Pamphilus</hi> had told him of her diſguiſing in the habit of a Pilgrim; ſo ſoone as ſhe heard of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement, fled ſecretly from <hi>Barcelon.</hi> In the meane time <hi>Liſard</hi> the Eldeſt brother vnto <hi>Celio</hi> and <hi>Niſa,</hi> who as you heard, was a Soldier in <hi>Flanders,</hi> Diſimbarquing in the ſame Towne of <hi>Barcelon,</hi> farre from thinking that perſons ſo neare him were there: hauing met with <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> vpon the way, on the firſt day of her trauell, althogh almoſt in the laſt of the tragecall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Comedy of her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, ſorry to ſee ſo faire a Pilgrim goe a foote, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding which way ſhe was bound, offered to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany

               <p>The day following, <hi>Liſard</hi> reſoluing to goe ſeeke for his ſiſter <hi>Niſa,</hi> and to kill <hi>Pamphilus,</hi> tolde his Parents that he had ſome pretentions at the Court, vpon which he built the neceſſity of a new voyage, ſhewing them ſome atteſtations in writing of that which he had done in <hi>Flanders,</hi> for which he hoped of good recompence. His Father perſpicuoſly knowing his minde through his reaſons, wherewith hee endeauoured to colour his Iourney, and fearing to looſe him with the other, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded a thouſand obiections, telling that he ſhould now reſt after his voyage, and from the trauels of War, contenting himſelfe with the honor which he had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, becauſe that in this age the reward did flye from the merit. <hi>Liſard</hi> thus perſwaded by his Father, remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

in the houſe although it grieued him, that after he had bought ſo much renowne with the loſſe of his blood ſo farre from his owne Countrey, he ſhould now lye ſtill and ruſt with infamy; finally being diſcontent, that he was beheld as he thought with this marke, hee went into the Country, to ſhun the firſt incounter of the peoples ſight, into the ſame Village, where amongſt the other ſeruants of his Fathers farmer, <hi>Pamphilus</hi> liued, who was neuer before knowne of <hi>Liſard;</hi> and as one day hee beheld him more curiouſly then he did all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, for hardly could the baſenes and indignity of his habite diſguiſe his perſon and beauty; he called him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and informing himſelfe of the cauſe, why hee li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in this baſe office: The excuſes which he made, did not ſeeme currant, (indeed being fained by <hi>Pamphilus,</hi> who already knewe that <hi>Liſard</hi> was <hi>Niſa's</hi> eldeſt Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.) Wherefore <hi>Liſard</hi> ſaid vnto him, that he ſhould doe better, if leauing this ruſticke life, hee would abide in his ſeruice and take the charge of two Horſes which he had, for which he would giue him wages, and conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient clothes; <hi>Pamphilus</hi> refuſed this offer, not that hee was not willing to returne into this happy houſe, in which he had firſt knowne <hi>Niſa:</hi> But fearing that being knowne in her abſence, hee ſhould run a dangerous for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of his life. Neuertheles, being weary of the auſtere life which he led amongſt theſe Mountaines, for there is nothing more true (as the Philoſophers ſay) then that thoſe which are ſolitary are either Gods or Deuils; hee reſolued in the end to accept of this condition, wiſhing rather that he might Dye by <hi>Niſa's</hi> Parents hands, then Liue any longer in theſe ſolitary Deſerts.</p>

Now you ſee how forward we are in bringing back our Pilgrim from his long trauels, ſeeing that from being a Courtier, he became a Soldier; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a ſoldier, a Captiue; from a captiue, a Pilgrim; from a Pilgrim, a Priſoner; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a Priſoner a Madman; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a Madman, a Herdſman; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a Herdſman, a miſerable Lacky, in the ſame houſe where all his misfortunes began: To the end that you ſeeing this circle of fortune from one Pole vnto another, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out one moment of reſt, or any of good, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, middle, or end of his aduentures: you may learne to know, how trauailing abroad brings honour, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite, and many times the contrary. All conſiſteth in the diſpoſition of Heauen, whoſe influence guide the paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of our life, as it pleaſeth them; becauſe that althogh the empire of free-will bee aboue, yet fewe perſons be found who doe reſiſt their motions; It is therefore a weaknes vnworthy of a gentle heart, not to dare hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>douſly to enterpriſe any thing, ſeeing it is euident, that if thoſe who haue effected great thinges, had not begun them, they had neuer atchiued them, As alſo hazardous enterpriſes belong onely to braue courages; although Heauen diſpoſe of the ſucceſſe. Aboue all things the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection importeth much, as <hi>Propertius</hi> ſaith, all thinges are not equall vnto all. <hi>Seneca</hi> telleth of an old man who being asked, how he could liue vnto thoſe yeares in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Court; anſwered, that it was in doing good turnes &amp; not excepting agaiuſt iniuries; But this pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence doth not ſeeme honourable vnto me, nor that it is any vertue to ſerue to Liue.

                  <hi>Toledo, Theſander</hi> being recouered by <hi>Niſa's</hi> louing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracings, and ſhe diſpoſed to leaue him, as well becauſe his life was aſſured as becauſe that ſhe deſired to aſſure hers, and deliuer herſelfe from the care wherewith ſhe was ſearched after by her Brother <hi>Celio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One night when ſleepe maſtered her Louers ſences, and held a ſilence ouer the whole Family, ſhe went out of the Citty, and taketh the way towards <hi>Lerida.</hi> But night had hardly all hid her blacke head, crowned both with ſleepe and feare, when the deceiued <hi>Theſander</hi> wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked out of the moſt ſorrowfull Dreame that could poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe his fantaſie, repreſenting to his imagination, the abſence of fugitiue <hi>Niſa,</hi> together with her deceitfull wordes, her ſweet diſdaines, and her faire <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

In aſmuch as thoſe thinges which threaten vs, doe repreſent vnto vs in ſleeping, the ſame cares which wee haue in the day awake. <hi>Theſander</hi> ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in this imagination, began to ſearch <hi>Niſa</hi> guided by the light of his ſoule, and not finding her, it little wanted that hee did not dye with griefe for her depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; neither his Father, nor the reſt of his Parents had power enough to keepe him from ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning after. And ſo he came to <hi>Toledo</hi> long time before <hi>Niſa.</hi> For a Louer whofoloweth that which he loueth, doth go faſter, then he who flyeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which he doth not loue; becauſe hee which doth not loue groweth ſorrowfull in going, and hee which loueth, by going puts off his griefe.</p>
               <p>In the meane time, <hi>Liſard</hi> much pleaſed with <hi>Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus,</hi> his vnderſtanding and perſon, had taken him to wayte in his Chamber, not ſuffering him to liue in the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:14312:75"/>
baſenes of his firſt office which he had giuen him, and in this quality hee liued at <hi>Toledo</hi> with his Maſter, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes taking great care, that his maſters Parents might not ſee him, becauſe that if they had viewed him with any conſideration, they muſt needs haue knowne him. But <hi>Liſard</hi> who with frequent conuerſation with <hi>Finia,</hi> (whome his Parents did vſe as louingly as they could haue done <hi>Niſa)</hi> was fallen in Loue with her, diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red one time vnto <hi>Pamphilus,</hi> and making him the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of his paſſion, gaue him charge to ſpeake vnto her, and to diſpoſe her, (with all his power) to be fauoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnto his deſires; <hi>Pamphilus</hi> obeying his Maſter, and taking occaſion one Feſtiuall day, when euery body was abroad, hee went to finde <hi>Finia</hi> from <hi>Liſard:</hi> But when in comming vnto her hee knewe her to bee his Siſter, and ſhee knewe him to be her Brother, they both remayned aſtoniſhed, dumbe, and as immouable as ſtones. But ſhortly after this firſt confuſion, <hi>Pamphilus</hi> began to ſpeake in this manner: Siſter tell me by what meanes thou cameſt hither, ſince <hi>Celio</hi> abandoning thee left thee in <hi>Barcelon,</hi> for I knowe already the whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe of thy misfortune, as conformable vnto mine as wee are equall in Birth.</p>
               <p>By his meanes whome the Deſtinies pleaſed, vnto whoſe diſpoſing my will cannot reſiſt: <hi>Liſard</hi> brother of my Husband <hi>Celio,</hi> hauing found mee vpon the way from <hi>Saragoſſa</hi> brought me hither, where I thinke, I may abide his returne with more honour. The ſame man ſaid <hi>Pamphilus,</hi> ſendeth me vnto thee to ſpeake vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee about his Loue, and hee hauing found me in a Grange which he hath in the Mountaines of <hi>Toledo,</hi>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:14312:76"/>
where I had ſheltered my ſelfe, from the ſtroakes of Fortune, vnder the baſeſt condition of the world, hath brought me now into this place where thou now ſeeſt me in the quality of a Groome; and becauſe that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore in the beginning of my Fortunes I haue beene in this houſe, I kept my ſelfe from being ſeene vntill this time, as thou mayeſt well know, hauing not beene ſeene vntill this day by thee. Suffer and abide the end of thy Fortune as I haue done, and doe not ſay thou knoweſt me, for I will entertaine <hi>Liſard</hi> with ſome Lye from thee, vntill ſuch time, that wee may ſee whereunto the reuolution of this coniunction of our misfortunes will tend, and when will end the effects of this our honours ecclipſe. Thus did <hi>Pamphilus</hi> and <hi>Finia</hi> meete, and in ſtead of reprehending one the other, they remayned there both good friends, for it is ordinary with thoſe who are culpable, to diſſemble the faults of others, leaſt they be reprehended for their own. In this meane time, <hi>Theſander</hi> went from place to place in <hi>Toledo</hi> inquiring for <hi>Niſa,</hi> and when theſe newes came vnto <hi>Liſards</hi> eares, that there was a young man which enquired for his Siſter; Hee verily thought that it was <hi>Pamphilus,</hi> who by ſome ſiniſter accident hauing loſt her, was come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to finde her. And telling vnto <hi>Pamphilus</hi> the ſtory of <hi>Niſa's</hi> rauiſhing, which hee knewe much better, told him, that hee was now in <hi>Toledo</hi> in her queſt; and that hauing no man, in whoſe hands hee could better com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the ſatisfaction of his reuenge, then his, nor of whoſe courage and fidelity hee could be better aſſured of; he intreats him, and coniures him to kill him. A no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table winding in a ſucceſſe ſo ſtrange and ſo imbroiled,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:14312:76"/>
which is ſo much the more admirable vnto me, who knowe it better then they who reads it, how true it is.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pamphilus</hi> aſtoniſhed, to ſee that hee was ingaged to kill <hi>Pamphilus,</hi> at the leaſt a man, who either in ſearching for <hi>Niſa,</hi> or elſe one who for the onely diſaſter of his name deſerued to dye, endeauoreth to finde him, rather to know what he would with <hi>Niſa,</hi> then with any mind to execute <hi>Liſards</hi> intent vpon the others innocency. His maſter did not accompany him in this action; for as <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſaith of <hi>Nero,</hi> although hee commaunded Murthers, yet he alwayes turned his ſight away from them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pamphilus</hi> hauing found <hi>Theſander</hi> priuately, would informe himſelfe of the cauſe why he inquired for <hi>Niſa: Theſander</hi> recounted the ſtory from <hi>Niſa's</hi> being woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by <hi>Celio,</hi> and healed by his Father, ſhee had left them one night without bidding them adue, paying with ingratitude all the good offices which were done her in that houſe. Neither did he forget to relate how ſhee (for the dreſſing of her wound) being conſtrained to open her breſts, ſhee was diſcouered to bee a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; from whence proceeded his deſire, and the cauſe why hee ſought her in this place, which ſhee ſaid was the place of her Birth. Ioyfull was <hi>Pamphilus</hi> to heare of the healing of <hi>Niſa's</hi> wounds, and in ſtead of killing <hi>Theſander</hi> hee led him into his Chamber, where hauing vſed him with all the curteſie that was poſſible, he tolde him that in this houſe where hee remayned, were <hi>Niſa's</hi> Parents and Brother.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Liſard</hi> hauing a great opinion of <hi>Pamphilus</hi> his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, whome he called <hi>Maurice,</hi> did verily beleeue that

hee would infallibly kill <hi>Niſa's</hi> rauiſher, which hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued to bee <hi>Theſander,</hi> wherefore he demaunded leaue of his Father to goe, fearing that if <hi>Maurice</hi> ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pely bee taken Priſoner, he might confeſſe the author of <hi>Pamphilus</hi> his death. The Father afflicted at his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, fearing that in this his age, Death might take him in the abſence of all his Children, would know the cauſe of his Iourney: And <hi>Liſard</hi> telling him that hee had ſent to kill him, who had run away with his Siſter, who was come vnto <hi>Toledo,</hi> and that hee did beleeue, that his ſeruant vnto whome he had giuen this commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion had already executed it, put the olde man into a greater care then hee was in before, much fearing the Damage which might come from ſo violent a reuenge: <hi>Pamphilus</hi> had perſwaded <hi>Theſander,</hi> to call himſelfe <hi>Pamphilus</hi> vnto all thoſe, who ſhould aske his name in <hi>Toledo,</hi> aſſuring him that hee ſhould the ſooner heare newes of <hi>Niſa:</hi> In this time <hi>Liſard</hi> and his Father com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into <hi>Pamphilus</hi> his Chamber, to knowe how he had ſucceeded in the execution of his command, found <hi>Pamphilus</hi> and <hi>Theſander</hi> together.

                  <hi>Celio</hi> in the meane time diſpayring to finde <hi>Finia</hi> or ſatisfie <hi>Niſa,</hi> hee for his part being more then ſatisfied, of both their innocencies, returned to <hi>Toledo,</hi> and ſome dayes before his comming thether hee met <hi>Tiberia,</hi> in whoſe company as he iourneyed, he heard newes of the Combate betweene <hi>Iacinth</hi> and <hi>Pamphilus,</hi> for which cauſe he offered her his houſe to retire vnto, vntill ſuch time, as that writing vnto her Brother, ſhee had made her peace with him, which might be done by the helpe of his Parents, whoſe helpe and aſſiſtance he promiſed.</p>
               <p>In this manner in one Day, and in one time, entred into the noble <hi>Leonicios</hi> Houſe; <hi>Aureliana, Pamphilus</hi> Mother, <hi>Niſa,</hi> and <hi>Eliza, Iacinth, Tiberia,</hi> and hee who was moſt diſpaired of, <hi>Celio,</hi> of whome there was no newes expected, being accounted as Dead, or Captiue as ſome had reported.

before his peregrination, bound <hi>Leonicio</hi> to ſhed abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of teares, and <hi>Aureliana</hi> could not forbeare when ſhee ſawe her deare <hi>Finia</hi> ſo long time loſt, and <hi>Celio</hi> with tender imbracings, demaunded pardon for his cauſeleſſe ſuſpitions, and of <hi>Niſa</hi> for the wounds which hee had giuen her, being ignorant what ſhe was. There was none diſcontented but <hi>Iacinth,</hi> who ſeeing his Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Tiberia</hi> in this company, without knowing how ſhee came thither, would needes take a publique ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction before all the world. But the authority of ſo many ſignall perſons not onely ſtayed him, but obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned pardon from him for his Siſters offence. <hi>Theſander</hi> and <hi>Pamphilus</hi> were taken out of Priſon, and then it was quickly known who was the true <hi>Pamphilus,</hi> whoſe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py finding there, did ſo reioyce the whole company, and the whole Towne, that all the Nobility and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try ranne for to ſee him, and reioyce with their Parents for their happy arriuall; Amongſt all which came vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this happy and Ioyfull welcomming home, faire <hi>Lucinda,</hi> who was marryed to <hi>Iacinth,</hi> to ſatisfie the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Obligations wherein ſhee was redueable. <hi>Liſard</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing opened his eyes vpon <hi>Tiberia's</hi> beauty, and by the impreſſion, which the report of <hi>Celio's</hi> Loue and <hi>Finia's</hi> made in his minde, cleane wiped away his Affection of that kinde vnto <hi>Finia,</hi> hee intreated <hi>Iacinth</hi> to giue her vnto him in Marriage, which was eaſily graunted, and with euery ones conſent. And to comfort <hi>Theſander</hi> for the Loue which hee bare vnto <hi>Niſa,</hi> he was Married vnto faire <hi>Eliza, Pamphilus</hi> Siſter, then about fourteene yeare olde. <hi>Celio</hi> with Ioy vnto all, marryed <hi>Finia.</hi> And <hi>Niſa</hi> after ſo many diuers fortunes, with the Ioy of both
