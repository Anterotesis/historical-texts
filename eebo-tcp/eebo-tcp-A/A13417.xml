         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>Why these Ships are called SHIPS.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> haue little to say to the Reader, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I neither know him or his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, therefore to auoyde lying and slattry in putting the stiles of Christian, Gentle, courteous, friendly, learned or honest, vpon the Atheiste, barbarous, hatefull, Ignorant, or dishonest, the Reader gets no Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle at all of me: If he be good and well inclinde it is the better for himselfe, and if otherwise, it shall not be much the worse for me, ther's the poynt: now the reasons why all these words or names of my Morrall Nauy are called SHIPS, or doe all end with the word or sillable SHIP, as Lord SHIP, Ladye SHIP, Freind SHIP and the like &amp;c. The reasons I take to be these which followeth, and as I imagine most signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate; first the whole life of man is as a SHIP vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der sayle, for, be it either day or night, storme or calme, light or darke, hot or colde, winter or sommer, yet the SHIP is in her course euer going on her voyage: so likewise <hi>Man,</hi> let him goe, sit, stand, ride, run, worke, play, sleepe or wake, yet he is still going onward in his mortall passage. A SHIP is euer in need of repayring,


<pb facs="tcp:23546:6"/>
so is a man eyther in body, minde or goods. A <hi>Ship</hi> is euer vnsteddy; a <hi>Man</hi> is alwayes mutable: Some SHIPS are hard to be steered; some men are harder to be guided. Some <hi>Shipps</hi> beare so great a sayle that they beare their Masts by the Board and make all split againe; some <hi>Men</hi> doe spread such a Clue in a calme, that a sodaine storme halfe sinkes them and teares all. Some SHIPS are so fauoured by the wind that they make rich voyages, &amp; quicke returnes; some men are so fortunate that wealth and promotions do fall in their mouthes. Some SHIPS runs through many a storme, with much danger, and yet are so vnlucky that they doe neuer make good voyage; some <hi>Men</hi> (being borne vnder a three peny plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net) can neither by paines, watching, labour or any industry bee worth a groat. Some SHIPS by being ouerladen haue bene cast away, some men by taking in too much haue bene forc'd to cast all away. SHIPS doe wallow and heaue and set vpon the Sea; <hi>Men</hi> do stumble, reele and stig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger on the land. Some <hi>Ships</hi> haue their cracks &amp; imperfections gayly hid with painting; some <hi>Men</hi> haue their bad intents coulourd ouer with hippocrisie, and their diseased carkases couered with good clothes. Some SHIPS doe bring pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable commodities, and some bring bables, toyes and tri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>les; some <hi>Men</hi> doe inrich a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome


<pb facs="tcp:23546:7"/>
with their wisedome, authority, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise in vertue: and some men doe disgrace and Impouerish a Monarchy by solly, ill imployed power, and sottishnes in vanity. Some SHIPS will run to leeward extreamly if the wind bee scant, and some againe will brauely beate it out to windward and weather it, so some <hi>Men</hi> will shrink from their friends or from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, in a storme of trouble or pouerty, and some few agen will beare vp stiffe, constantly contemning &amp; opposing the brunts of fortune. Some SHIPS are taken by others and made prizes; some <hi>Men</hi> are captiu'd by others and made slaues. Some SHIPS are commended more for their Bulke &amp; beauty, then for any good seruice; and some <hi>Men</hi> are more applauded for their fortunes, then for any good conditions. If I would insist longer on these comparisons, I could enlarge my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to the bounds of a Pamphlet: therefore I will conclude it with King <hi>Solomons</hi> similitude, <hi>wisdome</hi> 5. <hi>C.</hi> 10. that mans life passeth <hi>as a</hi> SHIP <hi>that passeth ouer the waues of the water:</hi> therefore I wish all men to bee prouided, as good SHIPS should be: let HOPE be their Anker, let <hi>Fayth</hi> be their Cable, let <hi>charity &amp; loue</hi> be their Card &amp; Compasse, till they come happily to the Hauen of GRAVESEND, and from thence to that bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed harbour which hath no END.</p>
