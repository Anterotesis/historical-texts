            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

One saith, that he would neuer speake to Vsurers, and Bribemongers, but when they be vpon their death-beds: for he which liueth by sinne, resolueth to sin, that he may liue. But when he goeth to hanging, <hi>Iudas</hi> himselfe  will say, <hi>I haue sinned.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 27. 4.</note> If I speake not to Vsurers vpon their death-bed, yet I speak to Vsurers which shal lie vpon their death-bed. Three things do giue me hope. One is, that all hearts are in the hands of God, to call them at what houre he list, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Saul</hi> may become an Apostle.<note place="margin">Act. 9. 15.</note> The  next is, that the third crow doth waken mo then the former, and therefore after the

crowing of other, this crow may happily be heard. The last is, that there is no sinne, but some men haue bene reclaimed from it, and so may Vsurers from their sinne.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hese two verses must be considered togither, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause one is the question, and the other is the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere: <note place="margin">Vers. 1.</note>
               <hi>Dauid</hi> demaunds  who shall come to heauen? and God tels him that vsurers shal not come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: as if he should say, they go to hell. Therefore as <hi>Paul</hi> taught <hi>Timothie</hi> to  warne them which are rich, as though they had more need to be warned than other:<note place="margin">1. Tim. 6. 17.</note> so this sentence seemeth to be penned for a warning to the rich, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it strikes vpon the rich mans vice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:8220:3"/>
I haue spoken of Bribery and symo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, and now I must speake of their si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Vsury. Many times haue I thought to speake of this Theame; but the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which are alleaged for it, haue made me doubtful what to say in it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it hath gone as it were vnder pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. At last you see it falleth into my text, and therefore now I cannot bauke it any longer. Therefore if any here haue fauoured this occupation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, let him now submit his thoughts vnto Gods thoughts; for I will alledge nothing against it, but that which is built vpon the rocke.</p>
            <p>Vsurie is the sinne which God will trie now whether you loue better than his word: that is, whether you wil leaue it if he forbid it: for if he flatly forbid it, and yet you wilfully retain it, then you loue Vsurie better than Gods word. <note place="margin">Vsurers He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes.</note>Therefore one saith wel that our Vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers are Heretikes, because after manie admonitions, yet they maintaine their errour, &amp; persist in it obstinatly as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists do in Poperie. For this cause I am
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:8220:3"/>
glad that I haue any occasion to griple with this sinne, where it hath made so many spoiles, and where it hath so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny patro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: for it is said that there be mo of this profession in this Citie, than there be in all the land beside. There be certain sinnes which are like an vnrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable enimie which will not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to death, &amp; this is one of those euerlasting sinnes which liue and die with a man. For when he hath resigned his pride and his enuie and his lust, yet Vsurie remaineth with him, &amp; he saith as <hi>Naaman</hi> said,<note place="margin">2. King. 5. 18.</note> 
               <hi>Let the Lord be merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vnto me in this</hi>: let me haue a dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation for this, as though this were a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie sin, &amp; he could not liue without it. <note place="margin">Three sinnes counted no sinnes.</note>There be three sinnes which are cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted no sins, and yet they do more hurt than all their fellowes, and those are Bribery, Nonresidencie, &amp; Vsury: these three because they are gainfull are tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from sinnes to occupations. How many of this citie for all that they are Vsurers, yet would be counted honest men, &amp; would faine haue Vsury estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:8220:4"/>
as a trade: whereas if it were not so gainfull, it would be counted as great a sinne as any other, &amp; so it is counted of all but the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which liue by it. This is the nature of pleasure and profite, to make sins seeme no sins if we gaine any thing by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but the more gainfull a sin is, the more da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous it is, &amp; the more gainful vsurie is, the more dangerous it is. I will speake the more of it, because happely you shall not heare of this matter again.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise.</note>First I will define what vsurie is: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, I will shewe you what vsurie doth signifie: Thirdly, I will shew the vnlawfulnes of it: Fourthly: I will shew the kinds of it: Fiftly, I will shew the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts which are alledged for it: Sixt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I will shew the punishment of it: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>thly, I will shew you what opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we should hold of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which do not lend vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vsurie, but borrow vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vsury. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I will shew you what they should do which haue got their riches by vsurie.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</note>Touching the first, Vsurie is that gaine which is gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by lending, for the vse of the thing which a man lendeth,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:8220:4"/>
couenanting before with the borrower to receaue more than was borrowed: <note place="margin">Vsurers steale by law.</note>&amp; therefore one calls the vsurer a legall theefe, because before he steale, he tells the partie how much he will steale, as though he stole by law. This word <hi>more,</hi> comes in like a sixt finger, which makes a monster, because it is more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should be. Another defining vsurie, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it the <hi>Contrarie to charitie</hi>: for <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Loue seeketh not her owne,</hi> but vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie seeketh anothers which is not her owne: therfore vsurie is farre from loue, but <hi>God is loue,</hi> saith <hi>Iohn,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Iohn. 48.</note> therefore vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie is farre from God to.</p>
            <p>Now, all the Commaundements of God are fulfilled by loue, which Christ noteth when he draweth all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements to one Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement, which is, <hi>Loue God aboue all things, and thy neighbour as thy selfe</hi>: <note place="margin">Mat. 22. 37.</note>as if he should say, he which loueth God, wil keepe all the Commaundements which respect God, &amp; he which loueth his neighbour wil keepe all the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect his neighbour, therfore to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:8220:5"/>
loue, God forbiddeth all things which hinder this loue: and among the rest here he forbiddeth Vsurie, as one of her deadliest enemies: for a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not loue and be an Vsurer, because Vsurie is a kinde of crueltie, and a kind of extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a kind of persecution, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the want of loue doth make Vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers: for if there were loue there would be no Vsurie, no deceit, no extortio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, no slaundering, no reuenging, no oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, but we should liue in peace, &amp; ioy, and contentment like the Angels; whereby you see that all our sinnes are against our selues: for if there were no deceit, then we should not be deceiued; if there were no slaunder, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we should not be slaundered; if there were no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie, then we should not be enuied; if there were no extortion, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we should not be iniuried; if there were no Vsury, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we should not be oppressed. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Gods law had bene better for vs then our owne law: for if his law did stand, then we should not be deceiued, nor slau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dered, nor enuied, nor iniuried,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:8220:5"/>
nor oppressed. God hath commaunded euery man to lend freely,<note place="margin">Luke. 6. 35.</note> &amp; who would not borrow freely? Therefore they which brought in Vsurie, brought in a law against themselues.</p>
            <p>The first Vsurers which we read of, were the <hi>Iewes,</hi> which were forbidden to be Vsurers, yet for want of faith and loue, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> doth shew how the <hi>Iewes,</hi> euen the <hi>Iewes</hi> which receiued this law from God himself, did swarue from it as they did fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the rest.<note place="margin">Ezech. 18. 22. Nehe. 2. 5.</note> First, they did lend vpon Vsurie to straungers; after they began to lend vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Vsurie to their brethren, and now there be no such Vsurers vpon earth, as the <hi>Iewes</hi> which were forbidden to be Vsurers. Whereby you may see how the malice of man hath turned mercie into crueltie. For whereas lending was commaunded for the benefite of men,<note place="margin">Deut. 15. 10.</note> Vsurie hath turned it to the vndoing of men: for they take when they seeme to giue; they hurt when they seeme to helpe; they damage whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they seeme to va<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage: therfore it is well noted that v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surie<note place="margin">2</note>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:8220:6"/>
hath her name of byting, and she may wel signifie byting: for many haue not onely bene bitten by it, but deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by it, that is, consumed all that they haue: therfore as the Apostle saith,<note place="margin">Galat. 5. 15.</note> 
               <hi>If you bite one another, take heede you be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured one of another</hi>: so I may say if you be vsurers one to another, take heede you be not deuoured one of another, for vsurers are byters.

God doth not license the <hi>Iewes</hi> to take Vsurie of any, but their enimies, whom they might kill: They might not be Vsurers vnto any, but to them of whom they might be destroyers, whom they might slay, of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> only they might take vsury: shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Vsury is a kind of punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and such a kind of punishment, as if we are to kill a man, it were a verie fit pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment for him, and therfore the <hi>Iews</hi> might take Vsurie of none, but them whom they might kill. I hope Vsurers will alledge this scripture no more.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, they say that they lend for compassion, &amp; so make Vsurie a work of charitie. This were charitie not to be partakers in our gaines, but to be partakers in our losses; but Vsurers wil be partakers in our gaines, but not in our losses; nay, though we lose, yet they will gaine: is this charity? it is Vsurers charitie.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, they say, if he gaine and I gaine too, is not this well? may he not consider my friendship, and be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full? yes, he may be thankfull, but no man is bound to be thankful, but when he hath receiued a good turne, then he is tried whether he will be thankfull or no: and if he requite thy curtesie, then he is thankfull, but if thou bind him to requite it, then thou art couetous.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly they say, Vsurie is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie for Orphans, and Widdowes, and Straungers, which haue no other way to get their liuing, and therefore some Vsurie must be tolerated. If Vsurie be necessarie for vs, how did the <hi>Iewes</hi> without it? Did God thinke it good for the state of their common weale to be without Vsurers? and is it good for the state of our common weale to haue Vsurers? this is wisedome against God.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fiftly they say: If I may not gaine by the money which I lend, I will lend no more, but keepe my mony to my selfe: nay, that is as bad to keepe thy money
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:8220:15"/>
from them which need, as to lend thy mony for Vsurie. For Christ saith<note place="margin">Matth. 5. 42.</note>, <hi>from him which borroweth turne not away thy face.</hi> Therefore thou art bound to lend. As he hath a cursse in <hi>Prou.</hi> 11. which keepeth his corne, when he should sel it to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which hunger; so he hath a cursse in <hi>Eze.</hi> 18. which keepeth his mony whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he should lend it to them which want.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixtly they say, because Vsurie comes of biting, the biting vsurie is onely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, &amp; none but the biting vsurie: why then all vsurie is forbidden, for all vsurie commeth of biting, so the wise God hath giuen it a name to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne it.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Lastly, they alledge the Law of the land for it, and say, the Queenes statute doth allow vs to take vpon vsurie ten in the hundreth. These are like the <hi>Iewes,</hi> which said,<note place="margin">Iohn. 19. 7.</note> 
               <hi>We haue a law, and by our law he shall die</hi>: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they could not say by Gods law he shall die, then they said <hi>by our law he shall die</hi>: so when they cannot say by Gods law we may take vsurie, they say by mans law we may
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:8220:15"/>
take vsurie, this is the poorest defence of all the rest: for if Gods law forbid thee, can any law of man excuse thee? As it would not serue <hi>Adam</hi> to say,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> 
               <hi>the woman bad me</hi>; so it will not serue the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer to say, the Law doth licence me. But he cannot say the Law doth license me: for though peraduenture our Law do tollerate more than should be tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, yet I would haue you know, that our Law doth not allow ten in the hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth, nor fiue in the hundreth, nor one in the hundreth, nor any vsurie at all: but there is a restraint in our Law, that no vsurer take aboue tenne in the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth, it doth not allow ten in the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth, but punisheth that tyrant which exacteth aboue ten in the hundreth. It is much like that tolleration which we reade of diuorces. For the hardnesse of mens hearts, Christ saith, that <hi>Moses</hi> did suffer the man and wife to part a sunder: So for the hardnesse of mens hearts,<note place="margin">Matth. 19. 7.</note> our <hi>Moses</hi> our Prince is faine to suffer as it were a kind of vsury, because otherwise no men would lend.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:8220:16"/>
These are the best excuses which our Vsurers haue to plead for themselues, against they come before the tribunall of God; &amp; if their reasons wil not stand before men nor their owne conscience, how will they stand before the Lord? And yet he which speaketh to these, maketh himselfe a mock. Christ prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched many Sermons, and was neuer scorned at any, but when he preached against couetousnesse, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is said that he was mocked:<note place="margin">Luk. 16. 14.</note> shewing that these kind of men are most incorrigible and wedded to their sinne till death make them part. Yet for their greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, we are comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to speak to them which wil not heare:<note place="margin">Ezek. 2. 5.</note> of which number is euerie reader of this Sermon if he be a Vsurer after.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">What the vsurer is like.</note>Now, you long to heare what the Vsurer is like. To what shal I like<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? They are like a Butlers box: for as all the counters at last come to the Butler; so all the mony at last com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to the Vsurer, ten after ten, &amp; ten after ten, and ten to ten, til at last he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:8220:16"/>
not only ten for an hundreth, but an hundreth for ten. This is the onely difference, that the Butler can receiue no more than he deliuered: but the Vsurer receiueth more than he deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth. They are like a Moth; euen as a Moth eateth a hole in cloath, so Vsury eateth a hole in siluer: If you haue a peece of siluer which is as much as an hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred pounds, in one yeare vsury will eate a hole in it as big as ten pounds: in two yeares she will eate a hole as big as twentie pounds: in three yeares she wil eate a hole as big as thirty pounds. Nay, now they say, he is but a bad husband which cannot eate a hole as big as fiftie pounds in a yeare: that is, which cannot gain halfe in half: how many holes haue these Moths eaten in poore mens gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? They are like Nonreside<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, that is, such bad members, that no man spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth for them but the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues. As no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> standeth for Nonresidencie, but he which is a Nonresident, or he which would be a No<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>reside<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: so no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth for Vsurie, but he which is an Vsurer,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:8220:17"/>
or he which would be an vsurer. They are like <hi>Iezabel,</hi> which said,<note place="margin">1. King. 21. 7.</note> 
               <hi>Let me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, I haue a way.</hi> If there be no way to liue (saith the false Steward) I know what to do I will deceiue: so if there be no way to liue (saith the vsurer) I know what to do, I will oppresse:<note place="margin">Luk. 16. 4.</note> If I cannot liue by buying, nor by selling, nor by flattering, nor by labouring, I will liue by oppression. But as one in his Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t speakes to the false Steward. <hi>Thou saiest I know what to do, but doost thou know what thou shalt suffer?</hi> So I say to vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, you say you know what to do, but do you know what you shal suffer? In deed he knoweth not what to do, which knoweth not to do well: and therefore Christ said of his persecutors, <hi>that they knew not what they did.</hi>

            <head>THE EXAMINATION of Vsurie.</head>
            <head>The second Sermon.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T remaineth that we speake of the vsurers punishment: Then, what may be thought of them which doe not take vsurie, but giue vsurie. Lastly, what they should do, which haue got their riches by vsurie.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of vsurers.</note>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> To begin with the punishment, not onely Gods law, but euen the Cannon law doth so condemne vsurie, that first it doth excommunicate him from the Church, as though he had no commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Saints.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, it doth detaine him from the Sacraments, as though he had no communion with Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, it doth depriue him of his Sepulcher, and will not suffer him to be buried, as though he were not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to lye in the earth, but to lye in hel.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Lastly, it maketh his will to be no
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:8220:18"/>
will, as though his goods were not his owne: for nothing is ours but that which we haue rightly got: &amp; therefore we say, It is mine by right, as though it were not ours, vnles it be ours by right. This is the iudgement of mans law.</p>
            <p>Now you shall heare the iudgement of Gods law. A vsurer doth receiue two Incomes; one of the borrower, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother of the reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger; of the borrower he lookes for gaine; but of the reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger he lookes for punishment: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the Scripture prophesieth euill vnto him, as <hi>Michatah</hi> did to <hi>Achab. Salomon</hi> saith.<note place="margin">Prou. 28. 8.</note> 
               <hi>He which increaseth his riches by Vsury, gathereth for them which will be mercifull to the poore.</hi> As if he should say, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hath loden himselfe like a cart, he shall be vnloden like a cart againe, and they shall inherite his money for whom he did neuer gather it. For, he which is vnmercifull to the poore, meaneth not to gather for them which will be mercifull to the poore: but <hi>Salomon</hi> saith, That they shall be his heires which will be mercifull as he
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:8220:18"/>
was vnmercifull.</p>
            <p>Now mark whether this prophecie of <hi>Salomon</hi> be true, I know not how many in this Citie do increase by vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; but this prophesie seemeth to be verified of manie: For it is noted, that the riches and lands of Aldermen and Merchants, and other in <hi>London,</hi> do not last so long, nor indure so well, as the riches and lands of others in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, &amp; that their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do not proue so wel as others, nor come to that place in the Common weale, which for their welth their parents looked that they should come to, I can giue no reason for it, but the reason of <hi>Salomon, He which increaseth by Vsurie, gathereth for them which will be mercifull to the poore.</hi> That is, their riches shall go from their heires to Gods heires, according to that, <hi>The riches of the sinner is laid vp for the righteous</hi>:<note place="margin">Prou. 13. 22.</note> that is, the righteous shal inioy that which the wicked gathereth. All riches are vncertaine, but the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches which are euill gotten, are most vncertaine: They may be called moue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:8220:19"/>
goods, for they are verie moue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, like the clowds which neuer rest till they fall as they climed. God saith,<note place="margin">Ezec. 22. 13.</note> that he will smite the vsurer with his fist, not with the palme of his hand, but with his fist, which giueth a greater blow. As his hands were shut against the poore, so Gods hands shall be shut against him, that his punishment may be like his sinne. But if you will heare their finall sentence, <hi>Dauid</hi> saith here, <hi>That they shall not dwell in Gods temple, nor rest in his holy mountain.</hi> The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we wil seeke no moe punishments, for this pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment is all punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. If they shal not come to heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whose the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shal those riches be? Nay, whose then shall the honour be when that day commeth? If he shall not rest in heauen, then he shal rest in hell where no rest is. Then saith one,<note place="margin">Note.</note> the vsurer shall crie vnto his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Cursed be you my children, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause you were the cause of these tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for least you should be poore, I was an vsurer, and robbed other, to leaue riches vnto you. To whom, the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:8220:19"/>
children shall reply againe, nay, Cursed be you father, for you were the cause of our torments; for if you had not left vs other mens goods, we had not kept other mens goods. Thus when they are cursed of God, they shall curse one an other, curse the Lord for conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, curse their sinnes for accusing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, curse their Parents for begetting them, and curse themselues, because they cannot helpe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues: As they which are bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed do nothing but blesse, so they which are cursed, do nothing but curse. This is the seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Vsury which the Vsurer shal receiue of God, after he hath receiued Vsurie of men, then the name of Vsurie shalbe fulfilled, as it signifieth biting, so when it hath bitten other, it shall bite the Vsurer to, and neuer rest biting; then they shall wish that they could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store againe as <hi>Zacheus</hi> did, &amp; shall not restore, because their money is gone. Therefore if Christ be come to your hearts, as he came to <hi>Zacheus</hi> house,<note place="margin">Luke. 19.</note> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store now as <hi>Zacheus</hi> did, &amp; escape this iudgement.

            <p>Therefore, if thou wouldest not be counted an Vsurer then, refraine to be an Vsurer now, for they which are Vsurers now, shall be counted Vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers then. Thus you haue heard the vsurers payment.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Answer. </seg>
               </label> but that was not for buying, but for buying in the Temple, where they should not buy, but pray: or else it was as lawfull to buy any thing, as it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to vse it.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">objection </seg>3</label> I know beside, that it is a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> saying, if there were no buyers, there would be no sellers, if there were no bribe giuers, there would be no bribe takers. <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Answer. </seg>
               </label> But in this case it may be rather sayd, if there were no takers, there would be no gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, for the giuer doth not make the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuer to take, but the receiuer doth make the giuer to giue, because he will not lend vnlesse the other will giue him for the loane: therfore as we say, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuer makes the theefe: so I may say, the receiuer of Vsurie, makes the giuer of Vsurie. Therefore I would be loth to compare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which are constrained to borrow vpon Vsurie, vnto them which did buy in the Temple, and were not constrained more then they which sold in the Temple. Much lesse may I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them which giue Vsurie vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which take Vsurie: for there is as great

He which lendeth for vsurie, lendeth for couetousnesse, but he which borroweth vpon vsurie, borroweth for necessitie.</p>
            <p>Now, for necessitie God hath allowed many things, as for necessity it was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for <hi>Adams</hi> sonnes to marie with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</hi> daughters, because there were no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther women. For necessitie it was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for <hi>Dauid</hi> to eate the shewbread,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 21. 6.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he had no other foode. For neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie it was lawfull to worke, and heale, &amp; fight vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Saboth, which was not lawfull, but for necessitie.<note place="margin">Luke. 13. 10.</note> Therefore for necessitie why may not a man pay more then he borrowed, seeing no Scripture doth forbid vs to pay more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed, but to require more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. Some do thinke, that as God did vse the ambition of <hi>Absalon,</hi> and the malice of <hi>Pharao,</hi> and the trecherie of <hi>Iudas</hi> vnto good: so men may vse the couetousnes of vsurers vnto good, that is, to helpe at

               </hi> did euil in swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring by Idols, but <hi>Iacob</hi> did not euill in receiuing such an oth of him though it was an vnlawfull oth. So, though the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer do euill in taking vsurie, yet a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth not euill in giuing vsurie. Beside, I may alledge the example of <hi>Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> &amp; <hi>Abimilech</hi>:<note place="margin">Gene. 21. 31.</note> 
               <hi>Abraham</hi> made a couenant with <hi>Abimilech</hi>: to confirme this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant <hi>Abraham</hi> sware, and <hi>Abimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech</hi> sware, <hi>Abraham</hi> sware by the true God, but <hi>Abimelech</hi> sware by his false Gods, and yet <hi>Abraham</hi> did receiue this oth and sinned not. So if her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie and the Turke should make a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant the Turke would not sweare as the Queene would sweare; for the Queene would sweare by the Lord, but the Turke would sweare by Mahomet:
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:8220:22"/>
if it be lawfull then to receiue such an oth, though it be an vnlawful oth, why may it not be lawfull for me to giue more than I borrowed, though it be vnlawfull for the Vsurer to take more then he lended? Beside, a Prince may not pardon a wilfull murtherer, yet I thinke that no man will say in hast, that he which hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted murther may not take a pardon. As this vnlawful gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing doth not make the taking vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; so the other vnlawfull taking doth not make the giuing vnlawfull. Beside, it is lawfull to suffer iniurie, though it be vnlawful to offer iniurie: it is lawful to suffer iniurie, as Christ payd tribute,<note place="margin">Mat. 17. 17.</note> which was iniurie; but, it is not lawfull to offer iniurie, because there are sixe Commandements against it.</p>
            <p>Now, to take vsury, is as it were to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer iniurie: but to giue vsury, is as it were to suffer iniury, therfore though I may not take more than I borrowed, yet I may giue more than I borrowed.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, I may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pare giuing of v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury to swearing; if a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sweare without
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:8220:23"/>
cause, he sinneth, but if he sweare as the word teacheth him to sweare, he sinneth not: so, if a man borrow vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vsurie, and borrow without cause, he sinneth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he feedeth the vsurer: but else, as a man may sweare in some case, so in some case a man may borrow vpon v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surie, that is, in case of necessitie, when a man must needs borrow, and can bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of none but of vsurers.</p>
            <p>Lastly, I may alledge that vsurie and vsurer, are neuer read in the Scripture, but they signifie him that takes vsurie, not him which giues vsurie: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Scripture seemeth to forbid ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, but not giuing.</p>
            <p>Many reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s more are alledged which I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not refute, &amp; therfore I will not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict them: yet I meane not to decide the questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, because I will not bemista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; but if some should come vnto me in that necessitie &amp; extremitie which I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> imagine, &amp; aske; may I borrow money of these vsurers to saue my life, or my credite, or my liuing, seeing no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> will lend me freely? I would answer him as
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:8220:23"/>
the Prophet answered <hi>Naaman,</hi> neither do, nor do not, but <hi>go in peace.</hi> I will not forbid thee, nor I wil not conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne thee, but if thy conscie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne thee not, I thinke thy sinne one of the least sinnes; and as <hi>Naaman</hi> prayed,<note place="margin">2. Reg. 5. 18.</note> 
               <hi>Lord be merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vnto me in this</hi>: so I thinke the Lord will be mercifull vnto thee in this: but if thy conscience go against it: then do it not, for it is sinne to thee, though it be free for another, because whatsoeuer is not done of faith is sinne.<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 23.</note> I charge you in the feare of God, that you do not mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take that which is sayd, for I know no learned Preacher, nor learned writer of other mind. Yet least you shuld mistake the matter, as I distinguished of le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders, so I will distinguish of borrowers.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Diuers kindes of borrowers.</note>If some may borrow vpon vsurie, it doth not follow that all may borrow v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon vsurie, because all haue not the like cause: therefore do not say that I teach you to borrow vpon vsury, for I thinke that the most in this citie which borrow vpon vsurie, should not borrow as they do, because they rather maintaine vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, then supplie their necessitie. Some I
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:8220:24"/>
know borrow for meere necessity; if any may be allowed, those are they: but there is a kinde of borrowers in this Citie, which feede Vsurers as the bellowes kindle the fire, for they haue no need to borrow, but because they would be rich, and richer, &amp; richest of all: therfore they will imploy all the money which they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> borrow, thinking to get more by the vse of it, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the vsurie of it doth come to. This maketh them sell their wares so deare, because they must not onelie gaine the price but the interest beside, &amp; more than the interest to, or else they gaine nothing. These borrowers are in another predicament than those which borrow for necessitie, &amp; therfore if they be not old enough to answer for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, I am to young to answer for them. There are other borrowers as I haue heard, which for some secret cause wold seeme barer &amp; needier than they are, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther because they would not be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged deepely with Subsidies, or else be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they would compound with their Creditors for a litle: therfore they will haue alwayes some thing for vsurie, that
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:8220:24"/>
their creditors may thinke them bare of money, or that other may pitie them in their charges. These are like those foxes which haue wealth enough to pay their debts, &amp; yet lye in prison because they would defraude their creditors. I doubt not but there be more sorts the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I know, I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not hunt euery corner because I wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t experience:<note place="margin">Note.</note> but this is my conclusion, I would haue no man pay interest vnto vsurers but for necessitie, euen as a tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailer giueth his purse to a theefe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he cannot chuse. Thus you haue heard what I can say of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which take vsurie, and them which giue vsurie.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">What Vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers should doe with their gaines.</note>Now you would vnderstand the last question. If you haue bene Vsurers al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie, what you should doe with that money which you haue gained by vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie? Surelie euen as <hi>Zacheus</hi> did, restore it agayne. If you cannot say as <hi>Samuell</hi> sayd, <note place="margin">1. Sam. 12. 3.</note>
               <hi>whose goods haue I taken?</hi> then you must say as <hi>Zacheus</hi> sayd,<note place="margin">Luke. 19. 8.</note> 
               <hi>whose goods haue I kept?</hi> The best thing is to doe no man wrong, but the next to that is, to make him amends. This God signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth when he sayth.<note place="margin">Iosh. 6. 18.</note> 
               <hi>Put away the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable<pb n="48" facs="tcp:8220:25"/> 
thing from you,</hi> that is, let no vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull thing stay in your handes, like the wedge of <hi>Acha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> which he had got by sin. The same law serueth for all which is got wrongfully, which was instituted against theeues, <hi>Restore it again</hi>:<note place="margin">Exod. 22.</note> the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of this law is, because the sin is not remitted, vntill the debt be restored, for as humilitie is the repentance of pride, &amp; abstinence is the repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance of surfet, and almes is the repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance of couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and forgiuenesse is the repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of malice, so restitution is the repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance of vsury; as he which is not hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble doth not repent his pride, he which doth not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine, doth not repent his gluttonie, he which doth not forgiue, doth not repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t his malice, so he which doth not restore, doth not repent his vsurie. For how ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he be said to repent for his vsury, which liueth by vsurie still. Therefore <hi>Daniell</hi> saith to <hi>Nabuchadnezzar,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dan. 4. 24.</note> 
               <hi>breake off thy sinnes by righteousnes,</hi> shewing, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but rightuousnesse ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> breake vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousnes. As diseases are healed by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie, so pride is healed by humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, gluttonie by abstinence, malice by
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:8220:25"/>
forgiuenesse, couetousnesse by almes, &amp; vsurie by restoring. This <hi>Paule</hi> calleth, <hi>The reuenge of a Christian,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Cor. 7. 11.</note> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he takes reuenge vpon his sinnes, &amp; punisheth his lustes, so that he maketh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to that which they would doe. Therfore you must restore that which you haue got by vsurie, or else you doe not repent of your vsurie. As a Camell whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he comes home casteth of his bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at the doore, that he may enter into his stable, so they which are laden with other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s goods, when they go to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, must leaue their burthen where they had it, least they be to grose to get in at the narrow gate. But as the disciples of Christ sayd,<note place="margin">Iohn. 6. 60.</note> 
               <hi>This is a hard speach,</hi> so to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which haue got most that they haue by vnlawfull meanes, this is a hard speach, to bid the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> restore it againe, there be two great rubs in the way.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Two obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</note>First, the losse which they shall su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine, if they restore agayne all which they haue got vniustly. Then the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie to restore it agayne to the right parties. If you aske me, as <hi>Amaziah</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the Prophet,<note place="margin">2. Chro. 25. 9.</note> 
               <hi>How shall we do for <pb n="50" facs="tcp:8220:26"/>
those hundreth tallents?</hi> How shall I liue when all is gone that I haue got wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully? I can say no more than the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet sayd to him, <hi>The Lord is able to giue thee more then this.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iuke. 19.</note> 
               <hi>Zacheus</hi> did not feare how he should liue, but <hi>Zacheus</hi> did feare to offende: so thou shouldest not feare to restore other mens goods, but thou shouldest feare to keepe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens goods: and as <hi>Zacheus</hi> liued when he had restored, so thou shalt liue when thou hast restored. He which sayth,<note place="margin">Mala. 3. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Trie me if I will not powre downe a blessing,</hi> trie him whether he will not powre downe a blessing; for he hath promised to blesse the lender as well as the Sacrificer. He which is the Lord of all, can giue thee more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou needest:<note place="margin">Deut. 15. 10.</note> but if you cannot restore to the owner, nor to his heires, then giue it to the poore, for they are the next heires, and repent that thou hast kept it so lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g: but in no wise thou mayst keepe it to thy selfe, because it is none of thine.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was like to dye, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say</hi> sayd vnto him,<note place="margin">Esay. 38. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Set thy things in order before thou dye.</hi> That which he aduised
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:8220:26"/>
him, he aduiseth all; set your things in order before you dye. What is this to set things in order, but to restore vnto euerie one his owne? When thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathest thy bodie to the earth, then thy bodie is set in order: when thou bequeathest thy soule to God, then thy soule is set in order: when thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathest thy goods to the owners, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thy goods are set in order: therefore if thou dye with other mens goods in thy hand, then thou dyest before thou hast set things in order, and then thou dyest in thy sinnes, and then no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise in all the Scripture appertaineth vnto thee, because nothing is promised vnto sinners, but vnto penitent sinners. Therfore that you may not dye in your sinnes, it is necessarie to make restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before you dye, or else you dye in your sinne, and are crossed out of all the ioyes of heauen. Wherefore as <hi>Abner</hi> said to <hi>Ioab,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Sam. 2. 26.</note> 
               <hi>Knowest thou not that it will be bitternesse in the latter end?</hi> So remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber whether this course will be sweete or bitter in the end. If they be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned which giue not their owne goods
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:8220:27"/>
to them which neede, like the rich glutton, how can they be saued which draw other mens goods from them, that haue more neede of theirs?</p>
            <p>Thus you haue heard the definition of vsurie, &amp; the deriuation of it, and the vnlawfulnesse of it, and the kinds of it, and the punishment of it, and the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which are alledged for it, &amp; what may be thought of them which do not take vsurie but giue vsurie, &amp; what they should do which haue got their liuing by vsurie.</p>
            <p>Now, seing you may not be vsurers to men, let euery man hereafter be an v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer to God, which promiseth; If thou leaue father, or mother, or wife, or chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or house, or land for him, not ten in the hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dreth, but an hundreth for ten; may an hundred for one, &amp; in the world to come, life euerlasting: that is, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand for one.<note place="margin">Mat. 19. 26.</note> That we may receiue this vsurie, let vs pray that the words which we haue heard out of this Psalme, may dwell with vs till we dwell in heauen.</p>
