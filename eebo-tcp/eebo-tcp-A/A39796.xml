            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is very well known, that he was of an honourable Extraction, and had ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Education. He was born at <hi>Huntingdon,</hi> and bred up in the famous U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſity of <hi>Cambridge;</hi> where whilſt he
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54215:5"/>
was a Student, there wanted not ſome Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of his future Greatneſs: neither was he then ſo much addicted to Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as to Action, as was obſerved by his Tutor. After a good Proficiencie in the Univerſity, he came to <hi>London,</hi> where he betook himſelf to the ſtudy of the Law in <hi>Lincolns-</hi>Inne; that nothing might be wanting to make him a complete Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and a good Commonwealths-man.</p>
               <p>His Country was not unſenſible of his great Endowments: for when the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of thoſe times compelled the late King to call that Parliament, in the year 1640, (truly ſurnamed <hi>The long)</hi> he was elected by them to ſerve as a Member therein. And now God being diſpleaſed with <hi>England,</hi> for the abuſe of a long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Peace, and the bleſſings thereof, and determining to puniſh the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants thereof for the ſame, he ſent an evil ſpirit of Diviſion betwixt the King and that Parliament; They complaining of his evil Counſel, and He of their Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies and Fears: which Diviſion being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly fomented by Incendiaries, ſoon brake forth into the flame of open Hoſtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, both parties pretending one and the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54215:5"/>
ſame Cauſe of Quarrel. But to that which is chiefly intended.</p>
               <p>No ſooner had the Drum and Trumpet ſummoned the Nation to Arms, but <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi> was alarmed, who <hi>(tam Marte quam Mercurio)</hi> neglecting the ſoftneſs of a Sedentary, betook himſelf to a Martial employment, and immediately raiſed a Troop of Horſe for the Parliament among his neighbours, at his own charge. The Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge</hi> being not far off him, and the place of his Education, he had a ſpecial regard thereto; and knowing that Univerſities (of all places) might be moſt addicted to the Kings intereſt, eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Parliaments (and this eſpecially) the greateſt depreſſers of Eccleſiaſtical Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in hope of which they are there nurtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; to put the matter out of doubt, he ſecured it for the Parliament; and that in the nick of time, when a large quantity of the Univerſity-Plate was about to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to the King then at <hi>Oxford.</hi> And ſo induſtrious was he in the Cauſe he had now newly undertaken, that hearing Sir <hi>Thomas Connesby</hi> (high-Sheriff of <hi>Hert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford-</hi>ſhire) was at the Town of <hi>St. Albans</hi> on a Matket-day, there to proclaim the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54215:6"/>
Parliament and their General the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> Traytors, (according to the Kings Proclamation to that purpoſe) he unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctedly ruſheth into the Town, takes the Sheriff, and ſends him up to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Being thus bleſt with a Troop, he aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments his Strength, making it up a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Horſe; whoſe Riders being ſtout and valiant, he took a courſe to preſerve, by Arming them <hi>cap-a-pe,</hi> after the manner of the German <hi>Crabats:</hi> whence in thoſe days he was commonly ſtiled <hi>Iron-ſides.</hi> Being thus re-inforced, he marcheth into the County of <hi>Suffolk;</hi> and having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence that above fourty Commanders, Knights and Gentlemen, were at <hi>Lowers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toft,</hi> contriving an Aſſociation of <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Suffolk</hi> for the King, he with ſuch ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſie and celerity enters the Town, that he ſurpriſeth them all.</p>
               <p>Having ſetled the affairs of the Aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated Counties firmly for the Parliament, he marcheth towards <hi>Newark,</hi> and blocks up that Gariſon; and finding a party of the <hi>Newarkers</hi> neer <hi>Grantham,</hi> he ſought them; in which Encounter, though he wanted of equality in number, yet he ſo
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54215:6"/>
far out-went his enemy in courage and reſolution, that he put them to flight, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf giving the firſt Onſet.</p>
               <p>About <hi>Newark</hi> he ſpent not much time, but advanceth with the Earl of <hi>Manche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> for the re-inforcement of the Siege of <hi>York,</hi> which was then beleaguered by the Scotiſh General <hi>Leſley,</hi> aſſiſted by Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Fairfax,</hi> and a conjunction of other Forces in the North. <hi>Cromwel</hi> had not been long there, but Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacheth with a great Army, to raiſe the Siege: Upon certain intelligence where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the Generals draw off the Siege, to fight him; well knowing, that if they won the day, that City would follow as an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix to the Victory. The Princes Scouts informing him that the Siege was raiſed, he ſent a party of Horſe to face <hi>Leſly</hi> on <hi>Heſſam-</hi>Moor, and in the mean time en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <hi>York</hi> with two thouſand Horſe, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him all things needful for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Gariſon: which having done, he ſeemingly made toward <hi>Tadcaster,</hi> but ſoon returned again into <hi>Marston-</hi>Moor, and there draws up his Army in Battalia, to the beſt advantage the ground would permit. <hi>Leſley</hi> was in the mean time
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54215:7"/>
marching with his Army toward <hi>Tadcaſter</hi> after the Prince: but hearing what he had done, he wheels about to give him Battel. The Prince having poſſeſt himſelf of all the advantages that might be, keeps his ground. The Generals, <hi>Leſley, Manche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> and <hi>Fairfax,</hi> having drawn up their Army in as good form as the time would permit, placing moſt of <hi>Leſleys</hi> and <hi>Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fax</hi> his Horſe in the Right Wing; <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter</hi>'s with other of the Scotch Horſe made the Left, commanded by <hi>Cromwel,</hi> (who had that Charge committed to him for the day:) the Foot made up the Main Body. Both Armies ſtanding in this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, Prince <hi>Rupert</hi>'s Left Wing making the firſt Charge, diſſipates the Parliaments Right; proſecuting their Charge with ſuch fury and vigour, that in a trice deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction was everywhere ſeen. <hi>Cromwel</hi> in the Left wing (not knowing what had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faln the Right) couragiouſly charges <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert</hi>'s Right wing; which ſoon turned the ſcale, before inclining toward the Prince: the advantage he got here, by his wiſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement thereof, ſoon redounded to the whole Army: for although many for fear disbanded themſelves and fled; yet the

reſt, as many as could be got together, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing led on by the Noble Earl of <hi>Manche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax,</hi> (the laſt of whom received in his face that day a Mark of Honour) joyning with victorious <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel,</hi> made the day clearly theirs. This Fight was the moſt bloudy of any in all the Civil wars, wherein was great ſlaughter on both ſides, judged by ſpectators to be little leſs then ten thouſand men. Prince <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert</hi> and his helpers being thus diſcomfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they fall out, and lay the blame of the miſcarriage one upon the other; the Earl of <hi>Newcastle</hi> and others of quality leaving the Kingdom thereupon. This impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being removed, the Siege of <hi>York</hi> was renewed: which City (though gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by valiant <hi>Glemham)</hi> being hopeleſs of new ſuccours, was ſoon yeelded.</p>
               <p>Many other examples of <hi>Cromwels</hi> great Atchievements both North and weſt might be given, even whilſt he was in a lower capacitie: but ſtudying brevity, we ſhall paſs over many things, and come to ſpeak of him as under the New Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in which he received a greater Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
               <p>The Parliament ſeeing the war to be
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54215:8"/>
tedious; and finding, that notwithſtanding the daily great effuſion of bloud, and vaſt expence of treaſure, ſmall progreſs was made in the Kingdoms reſettlement, they reſolve on a new courſe, by new-modeling the old Army; and to prevent the juſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of any of their Members who might be diſplaced thereby, they paſs an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, (commonly called <hi>The ſelf-denying Ordinance)</hi> that no Member of Parliament ſhould ſerve in the Army, but wholly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the ſervice of the Houſe, unleſs they had the Houſes licenſe for ſo doing. Then they recruit the Army (which had been much waſted by Sickneſs, and a late defeat in the Weſt) to One and twenty thouſand, <hi>viz.</hi> Fourteen thouſand Foot, Six thouſand Horſe, and One thouſand Dragoons; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioning Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cromwel</hi> being then in the Weſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving intelligence of the new Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and of the ſelf-denying Ordinance; though he were a great and victorious Commander, yet he had not forgotten to obey; but immediately diſpoſing of thoſe under his Command, he poſts towards <hi>London,</hi> to attend his ſervice in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54215:8"/>
according to their late Ordinance aforeſaid: and underſtanding that the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral was then at <hi>Windſor,</hi> he took that in his way, and went to kiſs his Excellencies hand, and take leave of him. But the Parliament being ſufficiently ſenſible of his worth, and how excellent an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he might be in carrying on the War, they would not ſuffer him to deſert his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary employment; and the next morning before he came forth of his chamber, a Commiſſion was ſent him by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of both Kingdoms, whereby he was made Lieutenant-General of Horſe to the whole Army.</p>
               <p>Upon this new Eſtabliſhment, the Kings party were very much heightned, thinking it an eaſie matter now to ſubdue the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments Army, being thus chopt and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and many eminent Commanders laid aſide and diſcontented. But they found the contrary: for as a fractur'd bone well ſet, becomes the ſtronger; ſo this broken Army, being skilfully handled, became ſo well knit, that it was thereby rendred far more vigorous and effective. But to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cromwel</hi> having accepted of this new
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54215:9"/>
Command, he immediately applies himſelf to action. For the Kings main Mid-land Forces under the Command of Prince <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert,</hi> lying then about <hi>Worceſter</hi> and the borders of <hi>Wales,</hi> intending to take the Field; they ſent a Convoy of two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Horſe to <hi>Oxford,</hi> to fetch off the King, with the Train of Artillery, and to procure Recruits for the Army. <hi>Fairfax</hi> having intelligence hereof, ſent <hi>Cromwel</hi> with a party of Horſe and Dragoons to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pede their paſſage. No ſooner was order given, but he was at the work: for with incredible ſwiftneſs marching to ſeek his enemy, he found them at <hi>Iſlip-</hi>Bridge, and there encountred them, and that with ſo much gallantry, that he took 500 Horſe, and 200 Priſoners, among whom were many perſons of quality: here he took alſo (beſides many other Trophies of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour) the Queens Standard. And know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to little purpoſe to gain a Victory, and not to proſecute it, he therefore pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued the remnant that eſcaped to <hi>Bleching<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton-</hi>Houſe, where Colonel <hi>Windebank</hi> kept a Gariſon for the King: he ſummons the place, requiring a ſpeedy rendition; gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving its Governour to underſtand, that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54215:9"/>
otherwiſe they muſt expect the effects of the fury of an enraged Souldiery. The Governour being terrified by the late de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat, (it ſeems) deſpairing of relief from <hi>Oxford,</hi> and doubting his own ſtrength, delivers up the Houſe, with all the Arms and Ammunition therein; (marching to <hi>Oxford,</hi> where he was ſhot to death for his pains.) So that here were two Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; the well improvement of the firſt, procuring the ſecond.</p>
               <p>But letting paſs many of his more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable actions, (if any of his in this kinde may be ſo termed) we proceed to give an account of his carriage in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable and fatal Battel of <hi>Naſeby;</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mentioning that feat at <hi>Bampton-</hi>Buſh, where he took Sir <hi>William Vaughan,</hi> Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant-Colonel <hi>Littleton,</hi> with divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Officers, and 200 common ſouldiers.</p>
               <p>This Battel of <hi>Naſeby,</hi> brings to minde the ſaying of that learned man, <hi>Hugo Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> viz. <hi>When people fight for their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the Princes Crown lies at ſtake:</hi> which was verified upon the King in the effects thereof: for the ſcale of his affairs was thereby ſo turned, that in ſhort time after, he both loſt his Crown, and became ſubject
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54215:10"/>
to the will of his enemy; being never af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter favour'd with one ſucceſsful attempt. This Battel was fought on the 14 day of <hi>June,</hi> 1645. neer <hi>Naſeby.</hi> The Kings Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my lying in and about <hi>Harborough,</hi> where Prince <hi>Rupert</hi>'s Head-quarters were, they had reſolved the night before, to fight <hi>Fairfax,</hi> knowing themſelves to be much ſtronger then he, eſpecially in Horſe. They were not more forward to engage, then the other were willing: and thus being both agreed in the extremity of Diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they both draw into a large field by the Town ſide, about a mile and a quarter broad. This was the ample ſtage whereon that bloudy Tragedie was acted: ſad to behold! and ſo much the more ſad, when we conſider that it was Engliſh bloud, ſhed by Engliſh hands: here Relations were forgotten, friendſhip relinquiſhed; yea, he that perhaps but lately would have laid down his own, to preſerve the life of his friend, doth now uſe all poſſible induſtry to deſtroy it: and this upon no other ground, but the common Feud that was then riſen. Behold the effects of a Civil War! The Kings Front was made up of a gallant Body of Horſe; the Foot made
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54215:10"/>
a ſecond Body: the Right Wing was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the brother-Princes <hi>Rupert</hi> and <hi>Maurice;</hi> the left, by Sir <hi>Jacob Aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley:</hi> other Commanders of great quality, and long experience in Martial affairs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Seas, taking their places in the field. Thus being drawn out, with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to ſecond the main Body, they took up the whole bredth of the field. The Parliaments Foot made a firm Body in the midſt, commanded by Major-General <hi>Skippon,</hi> (whoſe actions that day deſerve an honourable mention) winged with Horſe on either ſide: the Right Wing was commanded by the valiant <hi>Cromwel,</hi> who (to the great joy of the whole Army) came in to their aſſiſtance the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, out of the Aſſociated Counties, with 600 Horſe and Dragoons; the Left was commanded by <hi>Ireton. Rupert</hi> gave the firſt Charge, which he did with ſuch vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence upon <hi>Ireton</hi> in the Parliaments Left Wing, that (notwithſtanding their ſtrenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous reſiſtance) he was routed, and his men put to flight, the Prince purſuing them thorow the Town: but having more minde to the ſpoil, then to the thorow-perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his work, he leaves the purſuit,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54215:11"/>
and aſſaults the Waggons; where being repulſed, he trifled out ſo much time, that <hi>Cromwel</hi> in the Right wing, aſſiſted by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Roſſiter,</hi> had in the mean time quite diſordered the Kings Left wing, and as it were raked the field before him; ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Horſe from the Foot, and thereby rendering them helpleſs one to the other. Being reduced to this exigent, the Horſe fled toward <hi>Leicester;</hi> in purſuit of whom, <hi>Cromwel</hi> (conſidering that though there had been a Rout, there might be a Rally; and not onely to prevent after-claps, but alſo to ſecure what was already won) ſent ſome few Troops, knowing that ſmall force might do great execution on a fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enemy: Himſelf in the interim joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with their own Foot, ſo encompaſſed the Kings Infantry, that (notwithſtanding they ſhewed much gallantry and valour that day, even to the admiration of their enemies) being tired out, and deſpairing of ſuccour, beholding nothing but death and deſtruction which way ſoever they looked, they threw down their Arms, and ſubmitted to mercy.</p>
               <p>The Kings loſs hereby will appear the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:54215:11"/>
greater, if we conſider it in theſe two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects:</p>
               <p n="1">1. He loſt a gallant Army, which was newly fluſh'd and heightned in their cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, by the late good ſucceſs they had in the ſtorming of <hi>Leicester;</hi> preſently after which, the King writ thus to the Queen: <hi>That without being ſanguine, he could report his actions to ſtand in a better condition then at any time ſince the War began.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Not onely was an Army loſt, but all poſſibility of raiſing another; ſo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly did the Victors husband and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute what they had begun and gotten.</p>
               <p>No ſooner had the Parliaments Army broken down this bank, but like a Torrent they ſoon overflowed the whole Kingdom, bearing down and ſubduing all oppoſers. <hi>Leicester</hi> was immediately regained; from thence they haſte to the relief of <hi>Taunton,</hi> which had been long beſieged by <hi>Goring</hi>'s Army, and held cut to admiration. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their approach, <hi>Goring</hi> draws off: they follow him, and overtake him neer <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,</hi> where they engage him: and here <hi>Cromwel</hi> ſhewed much prudence, as well as courage: for the Enemy being put to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54215:12"/>
flight, he would not ſuffer part of the Horſe to purſue, but cauſed them to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear till they were all come up together; and then himſelf led them on, doing the work ſo effectually, that he took almoſt all their Foot and Ordnance. Thence they ſtept to <hi>Bridgewater,</hi> a very conſiderable place, which (though obſtinately defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) was ſoon taken by ſtorm.</p>
               <p>In thoſe days there was a ſort of people called <hi>Club-men,</hi> who pretending Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality, would admit of no Armies within their Bounds: and ſo confident were they, as to capitulate with the General, as if they intended to cudgel him out of their Country, notwithſtanding his late great ſucceſſes; thinking to keep their Clubs in their hands, when ſo many gallant men had been forced to part with their ſwords. But <hi>Cromwel</hi> (not knowing what might be the iſſue of ſuch tumultuous aſſemblings) reſolves to curb them betimes, and to cruſh them in the egge: to which purpoſe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving notice of their Rendezvous, he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth toward them with a party of Horſe. They were four thouſand ſtrong, and had encamped themſelves on the top of a hill;
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:54215:12"/>
promiſing much reſolution in one of their Enſignes, which had this Motto:
<q>
                     <l>If ye offer to plunder, or take our cattel,</l>
                     <l>Be you aſſur'd we'll give you battel.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But this vapour ſoon vaniſhed: for <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi> giving but one Charge up the hill, rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and diſperſed them all, taking 400 priſoners, whom he carried to <hi>Sherborn;</hi> that Caſtle (governed by Sir <hi>Lewes Dives</hi> for the King) being then beleaguered by <hi>Fairfax,</hi> and ſoon after reduced by ſtorm.</p>
               <p>Hence the Army marcheth toward <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol,</hi> a place of very great importance, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the confines of <hi>Glouceſter, Wilts, Dorſet</hi> and <hi>Somerſet-</hi>ſhires. Prince <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert</hi> was in it, with about four or five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Horſe and Foot; who being too much addicted to Plunder, made the circumja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Country deſire to be rid of ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious neighbours. At the Armies firſt arrival, it was adviſed by <hi>Cromwel</hi> and ſome other chief Officers, that they ſhould ſtorm part of the City: which accordingly was put in practice ſo effectually, that Prince <hi>Ruport</hi> durſt not run the hazard of a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond aſſault, but immediately delivers up
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54215:13"/>
that great and well-fortified City, having liberty to march to <hi>Oxford.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This great ſervice being thus performed, <hi>Cromwel</hi> (without the leaſt delay or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion) taking with him a Brigad conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of four Regiments, haſtes to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement of that ſtrong Caſtle of the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vizes,</hi> whoſe natural ſtrength was much increaſed by the ingenuity of its Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour Sir <hi>Charles Lloyd;</hi> who being ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thereof, and confident therein, returns no other Anſwer to the firſt Summons, but <hi>Win it, and wear it.</hi> But as if neither Art or Nature could ſufficiently fence a place againſt the Stratagems and Aſſaults of this invincible Conquerour, (whoſe very name began now to be terrible to the ſtouteſt adverſary) he ſoon brought the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to terms, and compelled him to yeeld upon Compoſition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Winchester</hi> was ſoon reduced to the ſame paſs, after the Governours ſtomack had been a little brought down, by the Battery of great Guns and Mortar-pieces. Here valiant <hi>Cromwel</hi> (as always) being punctual in the obſervation of Articles, and being informed that ſome of his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers had been faulty therein; no ſooner
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:54215:13"/>
was the complaint made, but the redreſs was provided: for, hanging up one, to the terrour of others, he ſent the reſt of the offenders to <hi>Oxford,</hi> to be there puniſhed at the diſcretion of the Governour Sir <hi>Thomas Glemham;</hi> who returned them to him again, with an acknowledgement of his great Nobleneſs, in being ſo pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual with his enemy. His tenderneſs in this reſpect, had great influence on others that had a diſpoſition to yeeld.</p>
               <p>But now we come to <hi>Baſing-</hi>houſe in <hi>Hantſhire,</hi> a place that knew not what it was to yeeld. It was the Manſion of the Marqueſs of <hi>Winchester,</hi> ſtanding on a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ground; encompaſſed with a Brick Rampart, and that lined with earth; a deep dry ditch environing all. The Houſe being ſituate and built as if for Royalry, had this Motto, <hi>Aymez Loyalte.</hi> Here the Marqueſs ſtands upon his Guard, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted onely at firſt with his own family, and an hundred Muſquetiers from <hi>Oxford;</hi> but was recruited afterwards by the King from time to time, as occaſion ſerved. This Gariſon had been ſeveral times aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted, but to little purpoſe; firſt, by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Norton</hi> and Colonel <hi>Harvey;</hi> next,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54215:14"/>
by Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> with ſeven thouſand Horſe and Foot; who (although he were by many in thoſe days ſurnamed <hi>The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror)</hi> did little more then heighten the courage of the beſieged, who made fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent deſperate Sallies upon him. Thus out-braving all Aſſailants for ſome years, the place began to be eſteemed impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable: but <hi>Cromwel</hi> ſoon evinced the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: for having ſeen Sir <hi>Will. Ogle</hi> the late Governour of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> march out according to Articles, and ſetled the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of that Gariſon for the Parliament, he the next day marches for <hi>Baſing;</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he no ſooner comes, but he falls to the work in good earneſt; placing a ſtrong Battery againſt it, that ſoon made it aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; which perceiving, (for he had an excellent faculty in diſcerning advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges) he orders the ſeveral Poſts to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for a Storm. And although the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and difficulty of the work were great, even enough to take off the edge of an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary reſolution, having to deal with ſo valiant an enemy, who had often manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their high courage and great skill in withſtanding ſeveral former Aſſailants; yet he (accounting any deſigne the more
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:54215:14"/>
honourable, by how much the more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to accompliſh) gives the Onſet, and that to ſo good purpoſe, that the beſieged ſaw themſelves in no capacity to withſtand him.</p>
               <p>Thus was <hi>Baſing</hi> ſubdued: a ſervice ſo much the more acceptable, by how much the more good redounded to the Country (even to the whole Nation) thereby, in opening a way for Commerce and Correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence betwixt the Weſt of <hi>England</hi> and other parts, which before had been ſo long obſtructed by this Gariſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Langford-</hi>Houſe neer <hi>Salisbury</hi> was vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited next by <hi>Cromwel:</hi> but they within having head what he had done at <hi>Baſing,</hi> deſpairing of any better ſucceſs then that Gariſon, yeelded at the firſt Summons.</p>
               <p>From hence he marches towards the main Body of the Army, who were then upon a march towards <hi>Exeter,</hi> to block up that place. But that deſigne being for the preſent waved, they ſuddenly fall upon <hi>Dartmouth,</hi> and take it. Which being done, they encounter the Lord <hi>Hopton</hi> at <hi>Torrington,</hi> where he was defeated, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on purſuit, received (as he was formerly aſſiſtant in giving) a Corniſh Hug, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:54215:15"/>
thereupon enforced to disband. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon followed the rendition of <hi>Exeter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There remained onely now in the Weſt <hi>Pendennis</hi> Caſtle, which being blockt up by Col. <hi>Forteſcue,</hi> was ſoon yeelded.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Fairfax</hi> and <hi>Cromwel</hi> having tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly ſcowred the Weſt, and onely <hi>Newark</hi> remaining in the North, the hopes of the King and his party were very low; yet not quite dead; for they had ſtill a Party, commanded by that gallant old Souldier Sir <hi>Jacob Aſhley:</hi> but theſe hopes ſoon vaniſh: for he being encountred by Col. <hi>Morgan</hi> neer <hi>Stow</hi> on the Woulds, was utterly overthrown, himſelf and 1600 be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming priſoners to the Victors.</p>
               <p>And now that black cloud which had ſo impetuouſly ſhowred upon other places, began to gather about <hi>Oxford</hi> it ſelf, the Kings Head-quarters, and place of his reſidence; it being already blocked up by <hi>Fleetwood</hi> and <hi>Ireton,</hi> and every day in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of a cloſe Siege. Here Art her ſelf had contributed her utmoſt aſſiſtance, to make the place impregnable; it being encompaſſed with regular Fortifications, furniſhed with a ſtrong Gariſon of ſtout ſouldiers, ſtored with abundance of all
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:54215:15"/>
kinde of proviſions, and (which is more then all the reſt) governed by one that had given ſufficient proof of his valour and faithfulneſs formerly, in holding out two other Gariſons <hi>(Carliſle</hi> and <hi>York)</hi> to the utmoſt extremity. But all this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails not, <hi>Oxford</hi> muſt yeeld. And the unfortunate King, who had for ſome time paſt received no other News, but <hi>(Job-</hi>like) one meſſenger of ill tidings at the heels of another, having no Field-Army left, nor ſcarce a Gariſon to flee to, began now to conſider the danger of his perſon, and to caſt about which way to ſecure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and at laſt reſolves to perſonate a Serving-man, and by the Conduct of <hi>Aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burnham</hi> to eſcape to the Scotiſh Army be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Newark.</hi> The Parliament receiving intelligence of his being there, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the King: the Scots refuſe to deliver him; whereupon grew a great Conteſt betwixt the two Nations, concerning their propriety in the perſon of the King. But the Scots calling to minde, that 200000 <hi>l.</hi> was behinde of what the Parliament had formerly hired them for, thought they had now an opportunity to hedge it in, and therefore (like the Ape that made uſe of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:54215:16"/>
the Cats foot to take the Apple out of the fire) they vvave further diſpute, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving gotten their money, deliver up the King.</p>
               <p>Being in the hands of the Engliſh, he is conveyed to <hi>Holmby-</hi>Houſe in <hi>Northam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptonſhire,</hi> a Princely Manſion; where we ſhall leave him at preſent, and come to ſpeak briefly of ſome tranſactions in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, City and Army.</p>
               <p>Wars are not onely carried on by Swords and Guns, but Tongues and Pens are co-inſtrumental; which as they had been too much employed formerly, were not idle now. The diſtinguiſhing terms of approbry formerly uſed, <hi>viz.</hi> Cavalier and Roundhead, were now tranſmuted unto thoſe of Presbyterian and Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, who at this time claſh with a high hand. The Presbyterians endeavour to carry on the intereſt of the Covenant: but they are not herein countenanced by the Army, who ſhew their diſlike there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, by the impeachment of eleven Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Parliament, <hi>(Hollis, Stapleton, Waller, Maſſey,</hi> &amp;c.) vvho are its abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; they thereupon making a voluntary ſeceſſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:54215:16"/>
Great diſputes alſo aroſe in the two Houſes at this time concerning the King; ſome pleading his coming to <hi>London,</hi> with freedom, ſafety and honour, to treat with his Parliament; others urged that no more Addreſſes might be made to him. The City cloſeth with that party in the Parliament which was for the Kings re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; and were ſo hot upon it, that in a tumultuous vvay they vvould needs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel them to alter their Militia, and bring home the King. The contrary Party in the Houſe ſeeing violence offered them, they vvith the Speaker betake themſelves to the protection of the Army; vvho be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus countenanced by Authority, and thereby encouraged, reſolve upon a March for <hi>London,</hi> to reſtore the Members of Parliament to their places and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.

               <p>To return again to the King: vve finde him not to continue long at <hi>Holmby,</hi> ere Cornet <hi>Joyce</hi> vvith a Party of Horſe ſeiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on his Perſon, and carries him away to the Head-quarters. The Army having him now in their cuſtody, remove him from one place to another; as to <hi>Royſton, Hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, Cauſam,</hi> an Houſe of the Lord <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,</hi> (one that hath had a deep ſhare in the ſufferings of the Nobility:) here the Kings Children came to him, vvhere they dined together. But here he continued not long neither, before his remove to <hi>Hampton</hi> Court, vvhere being terrified vvith an Apparition of Agitators, he left that place, and unfortunately renders him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to Col. <hi>Hamond</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:54215:17"/>
vvhere he vvas ſecured in <hi>Carisbrook-</hi>Caſtle. Propoſitions are ſent to him from the Parliament, but vvith little effect. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked herewith, the Houſes paſt their Votes of Non-addreſſes to his Majeſty, and take the Government upon themſelves; vvhich vvas followed vvith a Declaration from the Army to ſtand in defence of thoſe Votes.</p>
               <p>Theſe Actions ſo far diſcontented the people, that in every place nothing could be heard but bad vviſhes, and vvorſe threats: from vvhence many did progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticate, the enſuing Summer vvould be a hot one in reſpect of VVars. And now the Subjects of both Kingdoms, vvhich before had joyned in Arms againſt the King, begin to look upon his Eſtate and condition vvith commiſeration, blaming themſelves for being inſtruments in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him into the condition he then vvas: and now they petition the Parliament (after the ſame manner that ſome years before they had the King) in a tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous manner; and impatient to have the grant of their deſires delaid, they preſs the Houſes for a ſpeedy redreſs of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Grievances; but could have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:54215:18"/>
anſwer, but vvhat vvas delivered by the Souldiers guarding the Parliament, and a Troop of Horſe from the Mews; theſe diſſwaded the <hi>Surry-</hi>men vvith feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling arguments from coming there any more.</p>
               <p>Theſe things made thoſe that before ſeemed paſſive, to be active: the ſable cloud of VVar (blown by the fury of the people) had now over-ſpread our Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere; vvhich Alarms the Army in all their Quarters. Firſt, a conſiderable part of the Navy, vvith Captain <hi>Batten,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Vice-Admiral to the Earl of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi> deſert the Parliament, and put themſelves under the power of Prince <hi>Charles:</hi> Next, the <hi>Kentiſh-</hi>men riſe in Arms, under pretence of Petitioning: <hi>Laughorn, Poyer</hi> and <hi>Powel,</hi> ſeiſed on ſome ſtrong Towns and Caſtles in <hi>South-Wales,</hi> and declared againſt them. Yet this vvas not all; there blew a Northern blaſt, that made many men ſhake: Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi> (a man vvho had received much of the King, but deſerved little) ruſheth in vvith an Army of Scots, and joynes himſelf to <hi>Langdale, Glemham,</hi> and others of the Kings Party in the North.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:54215:18"/>
Upon theſe Riſings, the Parliament conſiders how to conjure theſe evil ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits down againe: the Valour of their Souldiers had been tried in many Fights and Sieges before; their former good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes made them confident that Victory was ſettled in their Scabbards, and that they ſhould no ſooner draw their Swords, but their enemies would fly. To manage theſe Wars, <hi>Fairfax</hi> was ſent into <hi>Kent, Lambert</hi> into the North, there to ſtop (as much as could be) the over-flowing Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of <hi>Hamiltons</hi> Army, who waſted the Country at pleaſure, whereſoever they came: for <hi>Wales,</hi> victorious <hi>Cromwel</hi> was deſigned: before him (as forlorn) marches Col. <hi>Horton</hi> with 3000, who engaged <hi>Laughorns</hi> 8000 raw Welchmen, and rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them: <hi>Cromwel</hi> himſelf, ſoon follows after, with two Regiments of Horſe, and three of Foot. Now we ſee him in the Field again, to accompliſh great underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings; which he did with ſo much facility, that it rather ſeemed a Recreation then la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s <hi>Veni, Vidi, Vici,</hi> may well be attributed to him, who no ſooner came neer an Enemy and beheld him, but he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercame him: and indeed, his quick
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:54215:19"/>
Marches, furious Onſets, and victorious Conqueſts, came very neer <hi>Caſars</hi> At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements. The firſt place we finde him at in his march, was <hi>Chepſtow-</hi>Caſtle, which he reſolved to beſiege; but himſelf haſtning to <hi>Pembrook,</hi> he leaves Col. <hi>Eyre</hi> to diſpatch this piece of ſervice, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed it in fifteen days. <hi>Cromwel</hi> on the twentieth of <hi>May</hi> comes to <hi>Pembrook, Poyer</hi> being Governour of it; who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying much upon the ſtrength of the place, refuſeth all Conditions that are proffered to him. <hi>Cromwel</hi> not being accuſtomed to deſpair of any thing that is poſſible, applies himſelf to the Siege at Land; Sir <hi>George Ayſcough</hi> in the mean time with a Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Ships, caſt Anchor in the Roade, to forbid any ſuccours to be carried in by Sea; and, as occaſion ſerved, to furniſh the Leaguer with great Guns and other proviſions neceſſary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cromwel</hi> having taken a full view of the Caſtle, and conſidering the ſtrength of it, makes his way by approaches; and with his great Guns, ſummons them to yeeld. This courſe he thought the ſafeſt, upon theſe conſiderations: Firſt, for that by certain intelligence he was informed of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:54215:19"/>
the ſmall Magazine of Proviſion that they had in the Town and Caſtle; ſo that of neceſſity they muſt yeeld: their bodies being weakned for want of ſuſtenance, would bring down their ſtout Stomacks. Then, Diviſions among themſelves, which grew to that height at laſt, that the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers began to mutiny againſt their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders. And laſtly, (though he had Men enough to enforce them, yet) conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering this was not the laſt ſervice his Forces muſt go upon, he would not be too prodigal of pretious blood; knowing that Victory to be the cheapeſt, which is won without blows.</p>
               <p>Having thus conſidered of the matter, he cauſes ſtrict guard to be kept in his Trenches, that ſo they might be kept in from running away. This order was not long obſerved, before Hunger had ſo bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered down their Bellies, and therewith ſo quell'd their courage, that they deſired a Parly, and willingly yeelded up the Town and Caſtle upon quarter, as to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Souldiery; but <hi>Laughorn, Poyer</hi> and <hi>Powel,</hi> with ſome other of the prime Commanders, render themſelves priſoners at mercy; which ſome of them found, but
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:54215:20"/>
others were afterwards made exemplary.</p>
               <p>No ſooner was this conſiderable place reduced to obedience, but <hi>Cromwel</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately marcheth Northwards with all ſpeed poſſible, to diſperſe that black cloud which threatned to ſend a ſcotch Miſt upon thoſe parts of <hi>England:</hi> Being at <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,</hi> he acquaints the Parliament with the neceſſities of the Armie: which was no ſooner done, but immediately ſupplies were ſent, to the great encouragement of the Souldiery. <hi>Cromwel</hi> having joyned with <hi>Lambert,</hi> who then attended <hi>Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi> Motions, and retarded his Marches, their united Forces made an Army in all of 8600 ſtrong; too weak (in outward appearance) to grapple with 21000 men; but conſidering the courage and reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Souldiers, they were ſufficient to do the buſineſs, as it proved at laſt. <hi>Cromwel</hi> finding an opportunity to correct the Scotch for their inſolent rapine, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves to do it, and drive them home, or die in the attempt. At <hi>Preſton</hi> in <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſhire,</hi> his forlorn, conſiſting of 200 Horſe and 400 Foot, firſt engaged; after them, <hi>Cromwel</hi> himſelf brought up the main Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in as good a poſture as the Ground
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:54215:20"/>
would bear, (which being incloſure and mirie Ground, was inconvenient for Horſe) he fought them through a durty Lane, and forc'd them to ſeek ſhelter in the Hedges near at hand: which proved but a poor defence againſt the rage of <hi>Cromwels</hi> men. After four hours diſpute, they were driven into <hi>Preſton</hi> with the victorious Souldiers at their heels, who preſently cleared the ſtreets. The Duke finding the place too hot for his cold Conſtitution, retreates over the Bridge with as many Horſe and Foot as could follow him: but his ſhir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away would not ſerve the turn; they muſt firſt give an account of their buſineſs, before the paſs could be granted, which at laſt they had ſigned, ſealed and delivered. At the Bridge was the greateſt piece of ſervice, where extraordinary courage was ſhewn on both ſides; but eſpecially <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi> and his Men, imitating the Diſcipline of the ancient Engliſh, with Swords in hand ruſhed into the thickeſt of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: pelting them to death at a diſtance, they looked on rather as a ſigne of cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardiſe then courage: the Scotch not being well acquainted with that manner of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, did not like this rough handling;
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:54215:21"/>
and therefore betake themſelves to their heels; accounting that the ſafeſt way to ſave their lives: but this ſhift fail'd them; for <hi>Cromwel</hi> was as nimble in purſuit, as reſolute in fight. Lieutenant-General <hi>Bayly</hi> finding ſmart blows on his back, when he dared not turn his face, being dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven into <hi>Warrington</hi> Town, there capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to deliver himſelf and four thouſand with him priſoners at War: which was immediately done. VVe ſhould here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the Exployts of <hi>Hamilton</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, if he had done any; but more like a Duck, then a Duke, and General of an Army, he flees away to <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ttoxeter;</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being purſued, he was there taken priſoner by Col. <hi>Waite,</hi> and about 3000 Horſe with him.</p>
               <p>He being ſoon after brought to <hi>London;</hi> and not long after that, to a Tryal for his Invaſion; this was one of his Plea's to his Charge, <hi>That he was invited.</hi> But he found very ſorry entertainment: for after he had been thus ſhamefully beaten, he (with others) was adjudged to loſe his head.</p>
               <p>This great Battle was very conſiderable in many reſpects, as to the Victory it ſelf,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:54215:21"/>
2000 being ſlain on the ſeveral places, and near upon 10000 priſoners taken, one hundred Colours, with all their bag and baggage: then it conduced much to the carrying on the Parliaments Deſignes at that time; and withal, left no hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief for thoſe ſtout hearts that ſo obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately defended <hi>Colcheſter;</hi> whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, although they were againſt the times, yet 'twas an Honour for the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that it could produce ſuch Men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cromwel</hi> after this Victory, (being yet reeking hot with the ſlaughter of the Scots at <hi>Preſton)</hi> poſts away to acquaint <hi>Monro</hi> (who was then come into <hi>England</hi> as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to the Duke with a conſiderable Force) what was become of <hi>Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> and his great Army, which was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted ſo formidable, that it's very name terrified at a diſtance. <hi>Monro</hi> having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of his coming, had learnt ſo much wit in <hi>Germany,</hi> whilſt he was in great <hi>Guſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus</hi> his ſervice, as to fight with none but them that were of his match; and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Engliſh would be too hard for him, he withdraws back again into <hi>Scotland,</hi> where preſently after he was disbanded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cromwel</hi> having thus rid the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:54215:22"/>
in general of a great fear, and eaſed the North in particular of that ſad burden they groaned under by the Plunder and Oppreſſion of the Scots Army, proſecutes his Victory to the utmoſt, entring into <hi>Scotland</hi> it ſelf. In his vvay he reduced <hi>Barwick</hi> and <hi>Carliſle</hi> to their former obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, both being delivered on compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. Before his entrance into <hi>Scotland,</hi> he drew the Army to a Randezvouze on the Banks of <hi>Tweede,</hi> and cauſed Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to be made at the head of every Regiment of Horſe and Foot, that on the pain of death no Cattle nor Goods ſhould be forc'd from the Scotch people by any of his Souldiers in their March, without an eſpecial order; but that in all things they ſhould demean themſelves civilly in their March and Quarters, not giving of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to any: ſuch care had this great Captain to obſerve the ſame Diſcipline in <hi>Scotland,</hi> which before was eſtabliſhed in <hi>England.</hi> So taking his way directly for <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinburgh,</hi> he was met by many of the Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Nobility and Gentry from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of Eſtates, with congratulatory O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations in honour of his worthy Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; acknowledging that his preſence
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:54215:22"/>
would conduce much to the ſettlement of their diſtracted Kingdom. Being thus ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> he was received with great demonſtrations of joy, and lodged in the Earl of <hi>Murray</hi>'s Houſe: to him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted the Lord Chancellor of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; the Earls of <hi>Leven, Arguile, Caſſil;</hi> the Lords, <hi>Burley, Wariſton,</hi> and <hi>David Leſley;</hi> with many other perſons of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, both of the Nobility and Gentry. The Lord Proveſt, with ſeveral eminent Citizens, came to welcome him thither, and preſent their ſervice to him. When theſe Viſits were over, he deſired the Committee of Eſtates to ſeclude out of publick Office all that had any hand in, or did in the leaſt promote <hi>Hamiltons</hi> late Invaſion. To which the Committee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended; making this requeſt withall, (being fearful of themſelves, and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing new ſtirs might ariſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> after the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Engliſh Army) that the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral would leave ſome Forces with them, which might be ready to quell any Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections; promiſing, that when they had raiſed a Force ſufficient for their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, then they would diſmiſs them, and return them again to their own Country.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:54215:23"/>
This was yeelded unto; and Major Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Lambert,</hi> an experienced Souldier, with three Regiments of Horſe, was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the ſervice.</p>
               <p>Now things ſtanding in this poſture, to the content of both parties, the Scots in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited <hi>Cromwel,</hi> and the chief Officers of the Army, to the Caſtle of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> whither they all went in Coaches, and were highly treated at a Banquet prepared for them. At their departure, the great Guns and ſmall ſhot gave them many vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies for a farewel. Thus was he welcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Scots: hereafter we ſhall ſee how he will welcome himſelf; for this is not the laſt time which he means to viſit them: his next errand I fear will be leſs to their content.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cromwel</hi> having now finiſhed what he came about, prepares to depart. <hi>October</hi> the 16, 1648. he leaves <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> being conducted ſome miles on his way by <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile,</hi> and ſome other of the Scotch No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility; at whoſe parting, great demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of affection paſt betwixt them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cromwel</hi> now bends his courſe directly to <hi>Carliſle,</hi> from thence marches Souther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to compel Col. <hi>John Morrice,</hi> and thoſe
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:54215:23"/>
bold fellows, to yeeld, that held out <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tefract</hi> Caſtle. This place, though not very great, was very conſiderable as to the ſtrength of it; but 'twas not the Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor Wall of Stones, but the Wall of Bones (as it were) that made it ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous at this time all the Kingdom over. The Gariſon conſiſted of about 400 Foot, and 130 Horſe, bold deſperate Fellows, as may be perceived by ſome of their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. One day there iſſued out of the Caſtle a party of Horſe, who fetcht in Sir <hi>Arthur Ingram,</hi> and made him pay 1500 <hi>l.</hi> for his Ranſom, before he could get from them. Again, afterwards Captain <hi>Clayton</hi> and moſt of his Troop, was ſeized upon by them, and made priſoners: 200 head of Cattle, with many Horſes, they fetch'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Caſtle, whilſt Sir <hi>Henry Cholmley</hi> lay before it with his Forces to keep them in. But the boldeſt trick of all, was this: One morning before day there ſallied out 40 Horſe, who poſt away to <hi>Doncaster,</hi> where Col. <hi>Rainsborough</hi> then quartered, who had a Commiſſion to command in chief before the Caſtle: when they were come near the Town, three of the party left their Fellows without, and confidently
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:54215:24"/>
marching in, enquired for Col. <hi>Rainsbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough</hi>'s quarters; which when they had notice of, they entered, pretending to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver a Letter to him from Lieutenant-General <hi>Cromwel:</hi> The Col. little dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that theſe were the Meſſengers of death, confidently opens his Chamber door to receive the Letter; but inſtead thereof, he received that fatal wound in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his heart, that ſent him to his grave: And although his Forces were about him, and kept guard in the Town; yet theſe confident Fellows got back into the Caſtle in the middle of the day.</p>
               <p>To curb theſe inſolencies, <hi>Cromwel</hi> (im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after he had ſetled the Northern Counties in peace and quietneſs) comes to the Leaguer; and having ordered the ſeveral Poſts for a cloſe Siege, ſo that now they could not range abroad, he left a ſtrong party before it, commanded by <hi>Lambert</hi> (who was come thither out of <hi>Scotland.)</hi> Himſelf marches up to <hi>London,</hi> and takes his place in the Parliament, who were ſufficiently ſenſible of the large teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony he had given in <hi>Scotland,</hi> of his pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in governing his Army whilſt they were in that Kingdom, and with what
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:54215:24"/>
civility both Officers and Souldiers beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved themſelves, together with their care to avoid all cauſes of offence both in their Quarters and March. They thereupon order the hearty thanks of the Houſe of to be given to this worthy Captain; which was accordingly done by the Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, whilſt he ſate among them; he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it with great humility, (after his manner) not taking to himſelf the leaſt of all thoſe great things that were wrought by him, but attributing them wholly to GOD, who is the Giver of Victories.</p>
               <p>Now the ſmooth countenance of Peace having once againe appeared over moſt part of the Nation, the Parliament takes into conſideration the puniſhment of the chief abettors and promoters of the late War; and looking upon the King as a chief Inſtrument, they reſolve to bring him to a ſpeedy Tryal: in order whereunto, a Charge was drawn up againſt him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of many Heads; chiefly, <hi>That he was the Promoter of the Rebellion in</hi> Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>The Contriver of the Wars in</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land: and what blood ſoever had been ſpilt in the Nation in the time of the Wars, was put to his Charge, as an Actor
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:54215:25"/>
in and at many ingagements; with many other Enormities and Crimes which they ſaid he was guilty of.</p>
               <p>To cary on this work thus begun, a high Court of Juſtice was erected, conſiſting of ſome Lords, many Members of the Houſe of Commons, and Officers of the Army; over whom was ſet Serjeant <hi>Bradſhaw,</hi> as Preſident of the Court. All things being thus prepared, the King was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted to St. <hi>James</hi>'s from <hi>Windſor</hi> by a party of Horſe, and afterward removed to Sir <hi>Robert Cottons</hi> Houſe, in order to his Tryal, which laſted three days: in fine, he was condemned, and preſently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter executed before his Palace of <hi>White-hall,</hi> on Tueſday, <hi>January</hi> the 30, 1648.</p>
               <p>Thus fell King <hi>Charles;</hi> a man indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſingular Vertues: temperate he was above all his Predeceſſors, both as to Wine and Women, taking no more of the firſt, then might well ſuffice and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh Nature; and for the laſt, conſtant to one; inſomuch that none of all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Kings that arrived to his years, (except his Royal Father) could be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to him. He was a good Theologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:54215:25"/>
not onely in the Theorick, but Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd what he knew. None ever under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took him in diſpute, but much admired his Parts; even thoſe Miniſters which the Parliament ſent to him in Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> beſides many others: the Earl of <hi>Worceſter</hi> and Mr. <hi>Henderſen,</hi> were both ſilenced with his Arguments. He was endued with much Patience, Proſperity and Adverſity being both one to him, working little elſe in him, but onely to ſhew that he had an abſolute command over his Paſſions and Affections. His Actions in the laſt ſcene of his Life, made many pity him, who before had undervaluing thoughts of his Abilities, looking upon him as too weak to bear the burden of three Kingdoms on his Shoulders. In a word, he wanted nothing, but leſs confidence in thoſe about him, and more courage and reſolution in himſelf, to be a happy King.</p>
               <p>This Tragedy being over, the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment immediately changed the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into a Commonwealth, voting <hi>a King and Houſe of Lords to be unneceſſary and chargeable: that the Supream Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſhould reſide in the Houſe of Commons alone, without King or Lords:</hi> and to that
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:54215:26"/>
effect, impoſed an Engagement to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by all perſons, before they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any benefit by the Law, or enjoy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny place of publick truſt or profit which they could hinder them of. This Pill ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſwallowed, but did not like the taſte: had it not been wrapt about in gold (their profit) few would have put it to their Mouths. The Stomacks of the Clergy moſt of all nauſeated it, being point-blank againſt the Covenant, which they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken not long before, and endeavoured ſtill to maintain.</p>
               <p>Affairs of State ſtanding thus, the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament finde the Nation full of Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that were lately disbanded, ſome by force in the field, as the Kings; and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the Parliaments, formerly in their ſervice, but now disbanded for ſupernu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meraries: theſe for the moſt part were men of Fortune, who by reaſon of their long continuance from their Callings, could not poſſibly ſet themſelves to work, and therefore muſt uſe their Swords to the beſt advantage, either upon ſome new employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or exerciſe arms on the High-way. Our new State being very ſenſible of this (as they were not onely vigilant to ſee,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:54215:26"/>
but careful in preventing all inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that might happen) found out a way to divert theſe ill Humours that lay lur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the Body of the Nation, by ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> them to <hi>Ireland,</hi> where they might do GOD and their Country good ſervice, in ſubduing the Rebels that now were grown ſo powerful, that no place but <hi>London-</hi>derry, and <hi>Dublin</hi> it ſelf, were able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them; nor they neither, without ſpeedy ſuccours from <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Rebellion (the moſt barbarous and bloody of any that ever broke out in any part of the world, acted by Devils in humane ſhape, rather then by men, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering no leſs then 200000 Proteſtants in two Months time, without any regard either to Age or Sex) was put in practiſe on the 23 day of <hi>October,</hi> 1641. which though it had been contrived with ſuch privacie, and acted with ſuch violence, yet Divine Providence did wonderfully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve <hi>Dublin,</hi> to be a Refuge for ſuch as eſcaped thither from other places, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the fury of their bloody Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Ireland</hi> lying in this ſad conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:54215:27"/>
weltring in blood, and overwhelmed in the greateſt Miſery that Fire and Sword could inflict, many of the poor Proteſtants get into <hi>England,</hi> hoping there to finde ſhelter from the perſecuting Enemy: but this proved little comfort to thoſe diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Souls; for here they finde, to the great Augmentation of their Grief, that <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> prepares on all ſides to act the ſame upon one another, vvhich had been done againſt them in <hi>Ireland.</hi> But although the difference between the King and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament grew vvider every day then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they endeavouring rather to get ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, then compoſe differences; yet 'twas ſo agreed, that ſome Regiments ſhould be ſent over into <hi>Ireland,</hi> to ſtop the proceedings of the Rebels: vvhich in effect vvas but as a Bucket of vvater caſt on a flaming Houſe, that could do little to the quenching of it.</p>
               <p>After ſome time, the King in <hi>England</hi> finding his ſtrength every day more and more decreaſe, and the Parliament to get ground of him in moſt places, did not onely ſend for thoſe Forces out of <hi>Ireland</hi> again, but many of the Rebels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:54215:27"/>
came to his aſſiſtance, ſo that <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> by this vvas in a vvorſe condition then ever, forſaken of all, and left to be vvorried by thoſe Blood-thirſty Wolves; vvorſe by a thouſand degrees then the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venous brood vvhich their Country pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth: yet vvhen their condition was at the worſt, it pleaſed GOD (vvho ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fails his People in diſtreſs, but makes their neceſſity his opportunity) to ſtir up the Parliament in <hi>England</hi> vvith Bowels of compaſſion to look on the diſtreſſes of their Brethren. Long had they faſted and prayed for them, but did not add to it their helping hand: one vvithout the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can never do much good; but joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together, a ſmall Force is ſufficient to accompliſh great Deſignes. <hi>A deſperate di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe requires a deſperate Cure.</hi> The State-Phyſitians of <hi>England</hi> having now quite purged out Monarchy vvith all its Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, and verified the words of Biſhop <hi>Laud, No Biſhop, no King;</hi> the firſt (with the Ceremonies of the Church) being fallen, quickly after came the other down alſo; they reſolve to ſend the ſame ſharp medicine to cure the Bleeding VVounds of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which (they thought) had

               <p>For the firſt, none but the Papiſts will
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:54215:29"/>
deny it: for the reſt, no man in the world could ſhew more Valour and Reſolution, nor Prudence to govern it, then General <hi>Cromwel.</hi> A ſtrict Diſcipline he ever ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, which is the Life of an Army; ſparing none that tranſgreſt againſt the Articles of War which were inſtituted for their better conduct. His Souldiers car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage and behaviour, through their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals care, won more then his Sword. A Deſigne being once reſolved upon, uſually himſelf was the Meſſenger to bring the Enemy tidings thereof, and then he would hardly give them leave to Arm before he aſſaulted them either by Storm or Battel.</p>
               <p>This made the old Emperour of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> ſay to ſome of his Courtiers, upon his hearing of News from <hi>England,</hi> That <hi>he thought</hi> Cromwel <hi>by tranſmigration was poſſeſt with the Spirit of</hi> Guſtavus <hi>his old Enemy:</hi> ſo neer did their actings in the Wars agree.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ireland</hi> (to ſpeak of its condition a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before he undertook his expedition thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) was in a manner wholly reduced by <hi>Ormond,</hi> formerly made Lord-Deputy by the Queen; who having joyned his Forces
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:54215:29"/>
to the Rebels, and <hi>Inchequeen</hi> himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now fallen off from that cauſe which before he ſtoutly defended, no viſible Force remained in the Field to oppoſe the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, who had the Kingdom wholly at their devotion, except <hi>London-derry,</hi> which was governed by Sir <hi>Charles Coot;</hi> and <hi>Dublin</hi> the chief City, wherein was Col. <hi>Michael Jones,</hi> with no great Force; and that which made it leſs, was the ſuſpition he had of his own Souldiers fidelity, who many times deſerted their Colours. The Enemy with a numerous Army lay under the VValls of it, with many menacing Summons, requiring of them a ſpeedy ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: yet through the vigilancy of the Governour Valiant <hi>Jones,</hi> it held out to the confuſion of the Beſiegers. But his preſent danger made him reiterate his Calls to the Parliament in <hi>England</hi> for ſpeedy Aid of Men and Proviſions, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadging, that elſe all would be loſt: and they being ſenſible of his condition, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedite their Aſſiſtance, appointing Com. Gen. <hi>Ireton,</hi> Col. <hi>Scroop,</hi> Col. <hi>Horton,</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor Gen. <hi>Lambert,</hi> with their four Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Horſe; Col. <hi>Ewers,</hi> Col. <hi>Cook,</hi> Col. <hi>Huſon,</hi> and Col. <hi>Dean,</hi> with theirs of Foot,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:54215:30"/>
and five Troops of Dragoons, all old Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of the Engliſh Army, whoſe Valour had often been tried in many ſharp En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters, and found not to fear the countenance of the fierceſt Enemy. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe, other Regiments were raiſed by beat of Drum, to make up the number ſufficient to carry on the VVork effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p>The Souldiers being in readineſs, and nothing wanting but a General, the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament having had experience of <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels</hi> great worth and valour, knowing no man more fitting for the Employment, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired him to accept of it; who received it with a great deal of chearfulneſs; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing how ready he was to ſerve in this Employment above any in the world, not doubting but GOD would make of him an Inſtrument to execute Vengeance upon the Rebellious Iriſh. This anſwer was ſo highly reſented by the Parliament, that immediately they conſtitute him General of all their Forces in that Kingdom, and Lord Governour both as to Civil and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Affairs in the Nation. Col. <hi>Jones</hi> they commiſſionated Lieutenant-General of the Horſe. This being done, the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:54215:30"/>
march with great ſpeed (not reſting above one night in a place) to the Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvous near <hi>Milford</hi> in <hi>Wales,</hi> there to expect the Lord Deputy <hi>Cromwel;</hi> who having diſpatched his buſineſs with the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, began his Journey.</p>
               <p>Tueſday <hi>July</hi> 10, 1649. leaving <hi>London,</hi> he ſet forward in great ſtate, himſelf drawn in a Coach with ſix Flanders Mares, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by many Members of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Councel of State, with the chiefeſt Officers of the Army; his Life-guard conſiſting of eighty men, which had been formerly Commanders, bravely mounted and accouter'd, both themſelves and Servants. Thus he rid to <hi>Branford,</hi> where thoſe Gentlemen that accompanied him took leave, wiſhing a ſucceſsful iſſue to this deſigne: which was anſwered again with great reſpect. Away he poſts for <hi>Bristol,</hi> to take order for the Traine of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery, and many other buſineſſes need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the haſtning his men on Ship-board. From thence he takes his way to <hi>Wales,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving before ſent three Regiments, <hi>(viz.</hi> Col. <hi>Reynolds</hi> of Horſe, Col. <hi>Venables</hi> and Col. <hi>Muncks</hi> of Foot) theſe as the <hi>Vaunt-Coureurs</hi> to the Army, were ſhip'd
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:54215:31"/>
from <hi>Cheſter</hi> and the Ports thereabout; who being favoured with a proſperous Gale, ſoon arrived at the Port of <hi>Dublin,</hi> where they were received with unſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable Joy and Gladneſs: the Citizens ſpared for nothing that might be a comfort to the Sea-ſick Souldiers, hoping that the recovery of their Health, might be an enlargement of their Liberties, vvho now vvere vvholly confined within the narrow compaſs of their City-walls. They were not at all deceived in their expectation: <hi>Jones</hi> his courage being much heightned by the arrival of theſe men, novv ſcorned the Enemies Bravadoes, and reſolves (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the firſt opportunity) by Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, to remove them farther off; which it was not long before he performed: as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by what follows. On Tueſday, <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt</hi> 2. 1649. the Enemy confidently draws down (vvith a party of 1500 Foot beſides Horſe) to <hi>Baggotſrold,</hi> a place within one quarter of a Mile Eaſtward of the City upon the Sea: hence they intended to run their trenches towards the City<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works, and thereby ſecure thoſe Forts which were intended to be made towards the water, to hinder the landing of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:54215:31"/>
and ſuccours expected from <hi>England.</hi> But <hi>Jones</hi> and <hi>Reynolds,</hi> with thoſe other Commanders in the City, obſerving the intent of the Enemy, ſaw a neceſſity to interrupt them in their deſigne, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpeedily drawing out twelve hundred Horſe, and four thouſand Foot, they with theſe quickly enter the works (which the Enemy had newly raiſed) and fell upon them with ſo much courage, that they rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their Horſe at the firſt charge: the greateſt part of the Foot were ſoon after cut in pieces, and moſt of the reſt taken priſoners.</p>
               <p>This ſucceſs ſo heated <hi>Jones</hi> his Men, that they followed the chaſe to <hi>Rathmines,</hi> where <hi>Ormond</hi>'s Camp was, and there they engaged his whole Army, conſiſting of 19000 Men. The report of this bold Attempt, quickly reached the General <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>'s Ears, who then (like a doughty Commander) was valiantly playing at Tables in his own Tent; and being told the news, wiſhed the Rebels (as he called them) would come, that ſo he might have ſport with them. His wiſh he had, but not the wiſhed effect: for the Tables are ſoon turned, the ſport proving very bad
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:54215:32"/>
and bloody to <hi>Ormonds</hi> whole Army, who were totally routed with a very great ſlaughter; 4000 killed in the fight and chaſe, 2517 priſoners taken, moſt of them men of quality; amongſt the reſt, <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds</hi> own Brother: All their great Guns, Ammunition &amp; Proviſion, they left behind them, and withall, a rich Camp, to reward the valiant Souldiers; who, with the ſpoil thereof, quickly clothed themſelves in rich Habits, and ſo marched into the City as it were <hi>incognito;</hi> for many of the Officers knew not their own Souldiers, they were grown ſo fine. This Victory was obtained with the loſs of few, the number not exceeding twenty.</p>
               <p>The News of this great Victory quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reached the Lord Governour <hi>Cromwel</hi> at <hi>Milford</hi> Haven, who was then ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping himſelf and Army. <hi>Auguſt</hi> the 13, he ſet ſail from thence with thirty two ſhips, wherein vvas the Van of the Army: on the 15 day, Major-General <hi>Ireton</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed after vvith the Body, ſhipped in forty two ſail: Mr. <hi>Hugh Peters</hi> brought up the Reare, in about twenty ſail. The Winds being favourable, quickly brought them to <hi>Dublin,</hi> where they were received
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:54215:32"/>
vvith all the ſignes of Joy imaginable; the great Guns ecchoed forth their vvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and the peoples Acclamations re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſounded in every ſtreet. When <hi>Cromwel</hi> (the now Lord Governour) vvas come into the City (the concourſe of people being very great to ſee him, vvhom before they had heard ſo much of) at a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent place he made a ſtand, and in an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble poſture, having his Hat in his Hand, he ſpeaks thus to the people: <hi>That as God had brought him thither in ſafety, ſo he doubted not but (by his Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence) to reſtore them all to their juſt Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties and Proprieties; and that all thoſe whoſe hearts affections were real for the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on of the great work againſt the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barom and bloody-thirſty Iriſh, and the reſt of their Adherents and Confederates, for the propagating of the Goſpel of Christ, the eſtabliſhing of Truth and Peace, and reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that bleeding Nation to its former hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and tranquillitie, ſhould finde favour and protection from the Parliament of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>and himſelf; and withal, ſhould receive ſuch endowments and gratuities as ſhould be anſwerable to their Merits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Speech was highly applauded by
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:54215:33"/>
the people, and anſwer returned by many hundreds, That <hi>they would live and dye with him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Army being all vvafted over, the General knowing that vvithout Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his labour vvould be in vain, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (to obtain it) he publiſhed a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, ſtrictly forbidding all perſons under his Command to uſe the frequent practiſe of ſwearing, curſing, and drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; declaring a full reſolution to puniſh with the greateſt ſeverity that the Law could inflict, all thoſe that ſhould neglect or contemn the ſame. This vvrought a great Reformation; many taking vvarn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by the puniſhment of ſome. The Army being now refreſhed, and the Lord-Governour having ſettled the Affairs of the City, both Military and Civil, he draws the Army out of <hi>Dublin</hi> to a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Muſter, vvhere appeared a compleat Body of 15000 Horſe and Foot: out of theſe were drawn twelve Regiments, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining in number between 9 or 1000 ſtout reſolute Men, for the preſent Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This Army being provided vvith all things neceſſary either for Offence or Defence, drawing along vvith them a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:54215:33"/>
traine of Artillery, four vvhole Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, and five Demy-cannons, beſides other Pieces uſeful either for a Siege or the field, the Lord-Governour marches them away, and quickly ſeats himſelf under the Walls of <hi>Tredagh.</hi> Here he finds a moſt reſolute enemy, that vvould ſooner break then bend: the Governour of the Town vvas Sir <hi>Arthur Aſhton</hi> (vvho had formerly been Governour of <hi>Reading</hi> and <hi>Oxford</hi> in <hi>England</hi> for the King) a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier he vvas, that vvould not be comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented out of his Gariſon; nothing <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ut force muſt do the fear. With him vvere about 3000 Horſe and Foot, moſt of them Engliſh. Obſerving the Rules of War, <hi>Cromwel</hi> ſent them a Summons; vvhich was ſlighted, and looked upon rather as a formality, then that he did believe to have the Town upon it. This taking no effect, the Lord-Governour orders all things for a quick diſpatch of the Siege: <hi>Aiſcough</hi>'s ſhips block them up by Sea; on the Land, the vvhite Flag vvas taken in, and the Red Enſigne diſplayed before the Town, to denounce blood and deſtruction vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſpeedy rendition. This did not much frighten the beſieged, vvho expected
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:54215:34"/>
ſuccour from <hi>Ormond;</hi> and beſides, they vvere unanimous in this reſolution, To ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire vvith the Town; vvhich they did ſhortly after: for now a ſtrong Battery being planted, it quickly levelled the Stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of a Church (ſo that it could not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be called a Steeple-Houſe) on the South ſide the Town, and a Tower by it. The next day, the Battery continuing, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter two or three hundred ſhot made, the corner Tower between the Eaſt and South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall vvas beaten down, and two breaches made, vvhich vvere quickly entred by Col. <hi>Huſons, Ewers,</hi> and <hi>Caſtle</hi>'s Regiments of Foot, the breaches being not wide enough to admit the Horſe to enter vvith them. Here the height of Valour vvas ſhewn on both ſides; they grappling vvith each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the Swords point; the Aſſailants fighting for the Town, and the Defenders for their Lives, (vvhich indeed vvill make a coward fight, though he fear to look upon the blows he gives:) the breaches vvere not more couragiouſly aſſaulted, then valiantly defended; the Enemy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in gallantly charging thoſe that entered, driving them back again vvith more ſpeed then they came in. <hi>Cromwel</hi> all this vvhile
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:54215:34"/>
ſtanding at the Battery, and perceiving his Mens retreat, draws out a freſh reſerve of Col. <hi>Ewers</hi> his Foot, and in perſon enters vvith them once more into the Town. The example of their General, vvith the ſhame of the former repulſe, ſo anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Souldiers, that none vvere able to ſtand in their vvay: and having now got ſure footing in the Town, they ſpare none, but put all they met vvith to the Sword. But though the town vvas thus vvon, it vvas not vvholly ſubdued: for <hi>Aſhtons</hi> men deſperately diſputed every corner of the ſtreets, making the Aſſailants vvin vvhat they had by inches; and at laſt, the ſtreets proving too hot, they betook them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Churches and Steeples, and other places of ſhelter: in St. <hi>Peters</hi> Church-ſteeple were got about one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, vvho there reſolved to ſell their lives at as dear a rate as poſſibly they could: but they vvere all ſoon blown up vvith Gun-powder, onely one man eſcaped, by leaping from the Tower; the Wind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing favourable to him, he onely broke his leg by the fall; which the Souldiers ſeeing, took him up, and gave him quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. In other places they were ſummoned
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:54215:35"/>
to yeeld; which they refuſing, preſently ſtrong Guards were put upon them, to prevent their ſuccour, that ſo they might be ſtarved out: vvhich device vvas ſo ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual, that it made them ſoon yeeld to the Conquerers Mercy; vvhich vvas but ſmall: for all the Officers, vvith the tenth man of the Souldiery, vvere preſently kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and the reſt thruſt on ſhip-board for <hi>Barbadoes.</hi> The Governour had his ſhare alſo, making an end both of his Life and Government together.</p>
               <p>This Town vvas the moſt conſiderable that ever <hi>Cromwel</hi> came before, if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the ſtout reſiſtance made by its Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, and how much the having of this place might conduce to the reducing of all <hi>Ireland:</hi> and though the attempt was bloody, <hi>Cromwel</hi> himſelf giving command not to ſpare any one that ſhould be found in Arms; yet Cruelty could not be laid to his charge: for, like a Politick State-Phyſitian, he here opens one Vein, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the vvhole Body of the Nation from a lingering War; and by this courſe likewiſe he vvrought ſuch a terrour in the Enemy, that ever after he made but ſhort vvork of any Siege, and in ſmall time reduced the whole Nation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:54215:35"/>
The report of this great ſlaughter, quickly flies away to <hi>Trim</hi> and <hi>Dundalk,</hi> (the two next Gariſons) which put them into ſuch a pannick fear, that they quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Towns: in <hi>Trim</hi> their haſte vvas ſo great, that they left their great Guns be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde them on the Platforms.</p>
               <p>Not long after this ſervice vvas over, the Lord-Governour knowing this ſtroak vvas as it vvere given upon the Lungs, and that a ſprightly proſecution would quickly beat the Enemy out of breath; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves to make uſe of the preſent oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity. Now his quarters vvere ſo much enlarged by his good ſucceſs Northwards, to the end he may get Elbow-room on both ſides of <hi>Dublin,</hi> he marches the Army Weſtward to attacque <hi>Wexford.</hi> In his March, a place called <hi>Killingkerick</hi> (about 14 miles from <hi>Dublin)</hi> vvas quitted, and a company of <hi>Cromwels</hi> Army put into it: ſo likewiſe was <hi>Arcklo-</hi>Caſtle, the ſeat of <hi>Ormonds</hi> Family.

               <p>
                  <hi>Octob.</hi> 1. the Army fac'd <hi>Wexford,</hi> and required the Governor Col. <hi>David Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,</hi> to make a ſpeedy ſurrender thereof. His anſwer was very doubtful as to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:54215:36"/>
which occaſioned many papers to paſs betwixt him and the Lord <hi>Cromwel.</hi> This delay of the Governour, was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely uſed, to protract time, until the the Earl of <hi>Caſtle-haven</hi> had entered into the Town 500 Foot to ſtrengthen the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon. The Governour having received theſe recruits, reſolves now to ſtand to it as long as he could, ſeeming to contemn the Force that lay againſt him. Near the South-Eaſt end of the Town is ſeated the Caſtle; upon that, <hi>Cromwel</hi> bends his greateſt Force, knowing that the gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof would be the Towns reduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Which fell out to be true: For many Peals of great ſhot were not plaid upon it, but the Governors ſtomack fell down to a rendition. The Souldiers being now poſſeſt of the Caſtle, and ſhewing themſelves from thence, ſtruck ſuch a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Fear into them in the Town, that they quitted the Walls; which <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Souldiers perceiving, in a trice they clapt to their ſcaling Ladders, and ſtormed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any great reſiſtance. Being thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the Tovvn, none vvas ſuffered to breath, that vvas found in Arms: and ſo cutting their vvay through the Streets,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:54215:36"/>
they came to the Market-place, where the Enemy (as if the blood had returned to the heart now at the laſt gaſp) moſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully fought for ſome time. This ſharp encounter laſted not long, before they were quite broken, and all that were found in Arms put to the Sword.</p>
               <p>The reducement of this place was of great conſequence to the Conquerers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Port-Town, and very convenient to receive ſupplies from <hi>England.</hi> From thence the Army march to <hi>Roſſe</hi> a ſtrong Town ſituate upon the <hi>Barrow,</hi> and far more conſiderable for Navigation then <hi>Wexford,</hi> the River admitting a Ship of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or eight hundred Tun to ride by the Wall. Of this place Major General <hi>Taaff</hi> was Governour, who had with him a ſtrong Gariſon; and to make all ſure, <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, Caſtlehaven,</hi> and the Lord of <hi>Ards,</hi> in their own Perſons, cauſed 1500 men more to be boated over to reinforce it. Of this, the Army were Spectators, but could do nothing to impede their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance. The Lord Governour no ſooner approached it, but he ſent the Governour a Summons, to this effect: <hi>That ſince his coming into</hi> Ireland, <hi>he ever avoided the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:54215:37"/>
effuſion of blood; having been before no place, where he did not firſt ſend them ſuch terms as might be for their preſervation; and to continue the like courſe, he ſummons them to deliver up the town to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of</hi> England. To this no anſwer at preſent was returned, until three great Guns planted before it began to play: then the Governour fearing to fall into the ſame <hi>Praemuniri</hi> that other Gariſons had done before, was content to treat; which they did, and came to this iſſue, That the Town be delivered up, and they within march away with bag and baggage.</p>
               <p>Whilſt theſe things were in doing, <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſale, Cork, Youghal, Bandon-bridge,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gariſons voluntarily declared, &amp; came under obedience: In the North, Sir <hi>Charles Coot</hi> and Col. <hi>Venables</hi> were very ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: the Lord <hi>Braughal,</hi> and Col. <hi>Huſon,</hi> in other places, did very good ſervice. I ſhould here particularize ſome of them, but that my whole deſigne is to march a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with the main Body of the Army.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Roſs</hi> being now in <hi>Cromwels</hi> Poſſeſſion, he cauſed a Bridge of Boats to be laid o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the River <hi>Barrow,</hi> and the Army to ſit down before <hi>Duncannon,</hi> a ſtrong Fort
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:54215:37"/>
commanded by Col. <hi>Woggen,</hi> (who had formerly ſerved the King in <hi>England.)</hi> This place was ſo well provided with all things, that upon conſideration at a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of War, it was looked upon to be time loſt in tarrying long before it: therefore the Army ſpeedily riſe, and march away into the County of <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> where <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> having joyned his Forces with <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequeen,</hi> gave out that he would fight, whatever came of it. His Army was ſtrong both in Horſe and Foot, far out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s, who was weakned by continual duty, hard marches, the Flux and other ſickneſſes raging amongſt them, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by wants, and unſeaſonable wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, commonly quartering in the field: yet for all this, <hi>Ormond,</hi> that <hi>Ignis fatuus,</hi> upon the approach of the Army, (whoſe weakneſſes at that time required rather an Hoſpital to cure their diſtempers, then an Enemy to make freſh wounds) vaniſhed away, without giving one ſtroke: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Col. <hi>Abbot</hi> reduced <hi>Eniſteoge,</hi> a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle walled Town about five miles from <hi>Roſs:</hi> and Col. <hi>Reynolds</hi> with twelve Troops of Horſe, and three Troops of Dragoons, marching up to <hi>Carrick,</hi> having
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:54215:38"/>
divided his men into two parts; whilſt they were amuſed with the one party, he entered a gate with the other, taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout one hundred Officers and Souldiers, without the loſs of one man.</p>
               <p>The news of this place no ſooner arrives at <hi>Roſs,</hi> but the Lord-Governour <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi> (who for ſome time had lain there ſick) marched away immediately to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the City of <hi>Waterford,</hi> hoping to gain that important place before the Army ſhould draw into Winter-Quarters. No ſooner was he come before it, but a Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Horſe, and three Troops of Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons, were diſpatched away to reduce <hi>Paſſage-</hi>Fort: this party ſoon made them deſire quarter, and deliver up the Fort and Caſtle: in it were five great Guns, and much Arms and Ammunition. Theſe Gariſons, now in the hands of thoſe that could make good uſe of them, were of great importance to the reducement of <hi>Munſter,</hi> and conſequently of all <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lord-Governour being now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Waterford,</hi> and ſeeing the City reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to ſtand upon their own defence; it being now <hi>December,</hi> the weather alſo
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:54215:38"/>
very wet, and his Forces weak, he draws them off into VVinter-quarters, that they might be refreſhed againſt the Spring, to finiſh the work ſo proſperouſly begun. Their quarters were at <hi>Bandon-</hi>Bridge; Col. <hi>Ewer</hi> and his Regiment, at <hi>Kingſale;</hi> Col. <hi>Stubber,</hi> at <hi>Cork;</hi> Col. <hi>Phaier</hi> and Col. <hi>Cook,</hi> at <hi>Wexford;</hi> and <hi>Youghal</hi> the Head-quarters: in other places conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for a quick conjunction if occaſion ſhould ſerve, the Army was placed.</p>
               <p>Now the Souldiery are taking their reſt, we may look back a little upon ſome Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which fell out ſince their leaving <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terford.</hi> No ſooner was the Army march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away, but <hi>Paſſage-</hi>Fort was beſieged by a party from <hi>Waterford,</hi> and another from <hi>Duncannon,</hi> joyned together: but Col. <hi>Zanckey</hi> ſetting upon them, routed the whole party, killing a great many, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying away 350 priſoners. Many other Skirmiſhes were maintained with the like ſucceſs: yet little comfort could be had in them, when the loſs of Lieutenant-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Jones</hi> vvas reflected upon; he died of a violent Fever at <hi>Dungarven, December</hi> 20, 1649. He was a man real to that truſt
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:54215:39"/>
which was repoſed in him; a daring man, yet governing his Valour with diſcretion, which makes a good Souldier<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not raſh, but adviſed in all his attempts: a great loſs he was to the Army, yet not all, for quickly after followed Col. <hi>Wolf,</hi> and Scout-Maſter-General <hi>Roe;</hi> the Army had their ſhare of this mortality: if the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders fall, how can it be expected the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Souldiers ſhould eſcape free? But to ſalve up the buſineſs, continual ſupplies were ſent by the Parliament from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which made them, as it were, immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal: ſo that though many men were loſt, their number was not diminiſhed.</p>
               <p>Whilſt the Army lay in their quarters, <hi>Cromwel</hi> was not idle; he viſited all the Gariſons that were in his poſſeſſion in <hi>Munſter,</hi> and ordered all Affairs both Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary and Civil. Coming to <hi>Kingſale,</hi> the Maior (as in other places) preſented him with the Mace and Keys; which he kept, (not returning them again) and conferred the Office upon another. This was looked upon the more, becauſe it had not been uſed by the Lord Governour: but the Maior being an Iriſh-man, and withal a Papiſt, it was not thought fit to
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:54215:39"/>
truſt ſuch a one with the Government of ſo conſiderable a place.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Cromwel,</hi> knowing that he which intends to do much buſineſs, muſt riſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and loſe no opportunity; his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers had not breathed in their Winter-quarters fully two months, before he marched out of <hi>Youghal</hi> with about 3000, to enlarge his quarters: when they were in the field, he divided them into two parties; himſelf took one, the other was led by <hi>Ireton,</hi> who marched away to <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi> there to reinforce himſelf by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of Col. <hi>Reynolds.</hi> Theſe were to march into the Enemies quarters two ſeveral ways, and to meet together at a Rondezvous near <hi>Kilkenny:</hi> in order to this deſigne, <hi>Cromwel</hi> takes vvith him one party, and marches away over the <hi>Blackwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> towards the Counties of <hi>Limerick</hi> and <hi>Tipperary.</hi> The firſt place he took in, was a Caſtle called <hi>Kilkenny</hi> upon the edge of the County of <hi>Limerick:</hi> afterwards in his march, fell in <hi>Clogheen-</hi>Houſe, and <hi>Roghil-</hi>Caſtle: here he paſſed the River <hi>Sewer</hi> with much difficulty, and immediately marched away to <hi>Featherd,</hi> a Gariſon-Town governed by one <hi>Butler:</hi> about
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:54215:40"/>
ten at night they got into the Suburbs, and ſent a Trumpet with a ſummons to the Town; which at firſt was ſlighted; but they taking a reſolution to ſtorm, Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners were ſent to treat, who agreed upon Articles to deliver up the Town, and march away with their Arms. The taking of this place much refreſhed the Army, who were tired with tempeſtuous weather.</p>
               <p>Yet here they tarried not long, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to <hi>Callyne,</hi> a Gariſon of the Enemy about ſix miles from <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> where they joyned with <hi>Ireton, Reynolds,</hi> and <hi>Zankey,</hi> making up in all a conſiderable Body. The chief ſtrength of <hi>Callyne</hi> conſiſted in three Caſtles that were in the Town; theſe the Souldiers ſtormed one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and carryed them all, putting all to the Sword they met with: this ſo terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied thoſe that kept a Houſe about a Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet-ſhot from the Town, that immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately they ſent to deſire liberty to march away to <hi>Kilkenny;</hi> which was granted. When the Souldiers had ſufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruited their Knapſacks with the proviſions taken in the Town, they marched back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to <hi>Featherd;</hi> by the way, the two Caſtles of <hi>Knoctover</hi> and <hi>Bullynard</hi> were
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:54215:40"/>
reduced: preſently after fell in <hi>Kiltennon, Arfennon, Coher,</hi> and <hi>Dyndrum,</hi> very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable places: in taking the latter, Col. <hi>Zanckey</hi> received a ſhot through the hands.</p>
               <p>The Lord Governour <hi>Cromwel</hi> had now wholly ſubjugated all places of advantage, except <hi>Limerick Waterford, Clonmel, Gallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> and <hi>Kilkenny:</hi> theſe were ſtrong, and required much time; however, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves upon the laſt: but conſidering that the ſtrength he had would not be ſufficient to carry on the deſigne, he ſent for Col. <hi>Huſon</hi> to march ſpeedily up to him with his Forces; which he did, and by the way took the Caſtle of <hi>Loughin;</hi> afterwards he joyns with the Lord-Governours Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my near <hi>Goram,</hi> a populous Town, ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by a ſtrong Caſtle, which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Col. <hi>Hammond</hi> a Kentiſh man: to him was ſent an invitation to deliver up the Caſtle; but he truſting to the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of his men, which were <hi>Ormonds</hi> own Regiment, returned a very reſolute an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; thereupon, the great Guns quickly roared out their perſwaſions, which made him beat a Parley when 'twas too late; for no other conditions could now be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:54215:41"/>
but theſe: <hi>That the common Souldiers ſhould have their lives, and the Officers be diſpoſed of as ſhould be thought fit.</hi> Theſe ſharp conditions being yeelded unto, the next day, <hi>Hammond</hi> his Major, and the reſt of the Commiſſion-Officers (all but one) were ſhot to death; and the Prieſt that vvas Chaplain to the Catholicks in the Regiment, hanged.</p>
               <p>This place being thus vvon, preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were made for the beſieging of the City of <hi>Kilkenny.</hi> This Gariſon required a more then ordinary Force to maſter it: for beſides the Souldiers of the ordinary Gariſon there, to it had reſorted all thoſe that had yeelded upon Articles the ſmall Caſtles and Towns in that County. Yet this did not at all diſcourage <hi>Cromwel,</hi> vvhoſe imaginations comprehended all things that vvere not impoſſible; and he ſcorning that this one place, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo ſtrong, ſhould be a dam to ſtop the current of his Victories; <hi>March</hi> 22, 1650. he diſlodged the Army, ſending firſt of all a ſmall party of Horſe before upon diſcovery; quickly after, came up the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: vvithin a mile of the City, there he made a ſtand, and ſent the Governour Sir
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:54215:41"/>
                  <hi>Walter Butler,</hi> and the Corporation, a ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to deliver up the City for the uſe of the Parliament of <hi>England.</hi> The next day an anſwer vvas returned, but not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory: thereupon, the approaches vvere made neer to the Wall, and a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery of three Guns planted to play upon the beſt place that could be to annoy the beſieged, and vvithal to open an entrance to the Beſiegers. All this vvhile, they vvithin vvere not idle; but perceiving where the Lord <hi>Cromwel</hi> bent his greateſt ſtrength, they provide there to make the greateſt oppoſition, by raiſing two Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchments on the inſide, ſtrongly pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſadoing them, and placing ſome pieces that might play to the beſt advantage: but above all, there vvas a crew of choice men that promiſed much. <hi>Cromwel</hi> hating de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, vvhen his buſineſs required diſpatch, cauſed the Guns to play; vvhich had not made fully one hundred ſhot, before a breach vvas opened. VVhile this vvas in doing, Col. <hi>Ewers</hi> vvith 1000 Foot vvas ordered to endeavour the poſſeſſion of one part of the City, called <hi>Iriſh Town:</hi> and the better to facilitate the enterpriſe, <hi>Cromwel</hi> gave the ſigne for the Souldiers
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:54215:42"/>
to fall into the breach: which they had no ſooner done, but they were beaten out again with loſs; and ſo diſheartned by it, that the ſtorm was left off: yet for all that, Col. <hi>Ewers</hi> carried the <hi>Iriſh Town</hi> with ſmall loſs, which made ſatisfaction for this affront. There being on the other ſide of the River another ſmall Town, or Suburbs to the main City, it was thought fit to ſend eight companies of Foot to poſſeſs it: which was done without any oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The gaining of this, encouraged them to endeavour to force a paſſage over the Bridg into the City; but it proved to the ſame effect as at the breach before. But theſe deſperate attempts made the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour reflect upon his condition; and the rather, becauſe the Gariſon in <hi>Cantwel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Caſtle, whom <hi>Butler</hi> had ſent for, deſired Paſſes of the Lord <hi>Cromwel</hi> to go beyond Sea to ſerve forraigne Princes, ingaging to act nothing prejudicial to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>England:</hi> which was granted them. That was one thing that diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him; but chiefly this, that he muſt not onely defend himſelf, but withal muſt be his own relief, there being no Army in the field ſufficient to do it; and withal,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:54215:42"/>
the longer he held out, the worſe it would be for him. Theſe things conſidered, made him hearken to a Treaty; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once commenced, they ſoon conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to deliver up the City and Caſtle upon theſe terms:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>To deliver up the City and Caſtle to the Lord</hi> Cromwel, <hi>with all the Arms, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, and publick ſtore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Inhabitants of</hi> Kilkenny <hi>to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected in their Perſons, Goods and Eſtates, from the violence of the Souldiery; and they that were deſirous of removal, to have liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty three Months after the date of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The Governour, Officers and Souldiers to march away with bag and baggage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The City to pay 2000 pounds as a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity to his Excellency the Lord</hi> Cromwels Army.</p>
               <p>Thus was the City of <hi>Kilkenny</hi> (which had been the ſeat of the ſupream Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, and the Centre where the lines of all their pernicious devices met, the producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons whereof had ſo malevolent an influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon poor <hi>Ireland)</hi> brought under
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:54215:43"/>
obedience in ſix days time, (for no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the Siege laſted) chiefly by the induſtry and indefatigable pains of the Lord <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel,</hi> who ever was a partaker with his Souldiers in their hardſhips, and never flincht from them at any time when need required his perſonal valour; inſomuch, that at many places he laid by the dignity of a great Commander, to act the part of a private Souldier.</p>
               <p>Here he tarried no longer a time then was requiſite to ſettle the Affairs of the City; which having done, he then march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Army to <hi>Carrick,</hi> from thence to proceed upon farther Action.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ormond, Caſtle-haven,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Clogher,</hi> being now very ſenſible of the deſperate condition their Affairs were reduced to, had a meeting at <hi>Baltamore</hi> in <hi>Weſtmeath,</hi> with the Gentlemen of that County, to confer about ſome better way to ſupport that cauſe which hitherto they had ſo poorly defended. The chief heads of this Debate were:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Whether they were able to raiſe ſuch Forces as might be ſufficient to fight the Lord</hi> Cromwel, <hi>now they conceived his Men were much weakned by the Winter,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:54215:43"/>
and taking in of ſo many Gariſons. Or,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>In caſe they were not able to fight, then with all the Forces they could make to fall into the Engliſh quarters, and there to burn and deſtroy what they could.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>If theſe two ways were not feiſible, then whether it were not most convenient for them all to joyn in ſome propoſitions of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cification for the whole, or every one for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to make his particular Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This laſt was hearkned to by ſome: but the chiefeſt of them knowing their own guilt, thought it not likely for them to get good conditions, now neceſſity com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled them to be Supplicants; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to miſchief the Engliſh in their quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, was looked upon to be the ſafeſt way for them all, to ſpin out time, til they could get a fit opportunity to make an eſcape out of the Land.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Cromwel</hi> having well refreſh'd his Army after the Siege of <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> ſits down before <hi>Clonmel,</hi> another ſtrong place, Gariſon'd by 2000 Foot, and ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore Horſe. No ſooner was the Leaguer planted, but Col. <hi>Reynolds</hi> and Sir <hi>Theophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus Jones</hi> were ſent with 2500 Horſe, Foot
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:54215:44"/>
and Dragoons, to be beforehand with <hi>Ormond, Caſtlehaven,</hi> and thoſe with them that intended an irruption into the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Quarters; but they ſhifting from place to place, to avoid fighting, Col. <hi>Reynolds,</hi> to keep his men from idleneſs, joyns his Forces with Col. <hi>Huſon,</hi> and with two great Guns and a Morter Piece, beſieged <hi>Trim.</hi> Another Party of 1400 Horſe and Dragoons, and 1200 Foot, under the Lord <hi>Broghil,</hi> were ſent to fight the Biſhop of <hi>Roſs,</hi> who with 5000 intended to relieve <hi>Clonmel.</hi> The Biſhops Mitre being me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphoſed into an Helmet, he thought verily to ſcare the Lord <hi>Broghil</hi> vvith the ſtrangeneſs of the ſight, being ſuch a thing as he had never ſeen before, a Biſhop that ſhould be the Shepherd of a Flock, now to head an Army of VVolves: but the Lord <hi>Broghil</hi> getting to them, in little more time then one could ſay tvvo or three Creeds, vvholly diſſipates them, killing upon the place betvveen 6 and 700, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king 20 Captains, Lieutenants, and other Officers; and to bring up the Rear, the Biſhop himſelf vvas taken, vvith the Standard of the Church of <hi>Munſter.</hi> The Lord <hi>Broghil</hi> having him novv in his
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:54215:44"/>
power, he carries him to a Caſtle defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Biſhops Forces, and there hangs him up before the walls, in the ſight of the Gariſon; which wrought ſuch ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in them, that they delivered up the Caſtle upon Articles.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſucceſſes of Parties abroad, did much encourage thoſe that beſieged <hi>Clon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel;</hi> who now on all ſides prepare to handle that Gariſon, as before they had done other places. And indeed, the Lord General uſed more then ordinary indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry in reducing this Town, in regard he had been informed that its defendants were very unanimous, and that they were choice men, well armed, and every way ſufficiently provided to make a ſtout re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance: and beſides, it was governed by an active Iriſh-man, one <hi>Hugh Boy O Neal,</hi> who had ſet all hands in the Town on work, to caſt up new Countre-ſcarps on the inſide of the old walls, and to do whatſoever elſe might ſerve for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the place; and had ſo travers'd the ground with Re-intrenchments, that it ſeemed altogether impoſſible to gain it by Aſſault; nothing but Hunger (as was thought) could reduce it to obedience:
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:54215:45"/>
but the active gallantry of the Lord <hi>Cromwel,</hi> would not admit of that courſe; he us'd not to ſtand dallying before a place, (as the <hi>Germans, French,</hi> and other Nations) trifling out precious time, and expending vaſt ſums, to little or no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: and beſides, upon many weighty conſiderations, this ſervice required a quick diſpatch; chiefly, in regard of his Expedition into <hi>England,</hi> whither he had lately been ſent for by the Parliament there, to ſerve them in ſome other way. He therefore (without delay) orders all things for a Storm, intending to try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that would not either drown the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, or cool their courage, who were ſo hotly ſet upon the defence. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour being ſummoned to a Rendition, and returning no ſatisfactory Anſwer, the great Guns were planted; which were managed ſo well, that they quickly open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a breach; which breach (upon a Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnal given) being couragiouſly entred by the Aſſailants, they within were not wanting to entertain them with a manful reſiſtance, and to forbid their march any other way then over their own bodies: but <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s men (who us'd not to be
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:54215:45"/>
thus check'd in the career of their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes) notwithſtanding the Enemies va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous obſtinacie, made good their ground, and maintained a Fight for four hours to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, which proved ſo hazardous, that the victory hovering betwixt both, it was hard to ſay on which ſide it would light, (there being a great ſlaughter on both ſides) till at laſt, the Lord <hi>Cromwel</hi> (aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by that good Providence which always attended him) decided the controverſie, by forcing the Enemy to quit the place, and betake themſelves to flight, wherein though they were very much favoured by certain hills near the Town, yet could they not avoid the rage and fury of the victorious Souldiers, who in purſuit paid them home in their own coyn. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this Fight, I finde it thus written by an eminent Commander in the Army, and an aſſiſtant in this encounter: <hi>We found in Clonmel</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the ſtoutest enemy that ever, was found by our Army in</hi> Ireland: <hi>and it is in my opinion, and very many more, that there was never ſeen ſo hot a ſtorm of ſo long a continuance, and ſo gallantly defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, neither in</hi> England <hi>nor</hi> Ireland. The Reduction of this place (though at a hard
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:54215:46"/>
hand) inclined many more to yeeld; which they did in a ſhort time after, without ſtriking a ſtroke.</p>
               <p>Theſe Atchievements being obtained, and care taken to ſecure what had been gotten, the Lord General addreſſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to his journey for <hi>England,</hi> having been in <hi>Ireland</hi> about ten months; <hi>viz.</hi> from the middle of <hi>August</hi> 1649. to the next <hi>May</hi> following, 1650. a time incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, reſpect had to the work done therein, which was more then ever could be done in ten years before, by any King or Queen of <hi>England.</hi> Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> indeed, after a long and tedious War there, at laſt drave out the Spaniards that came in to the aſſiſtance of the rebellious Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; but could never utterly extinguiſh the ſparks of that Rebellion. And not onely did the ſhortneſs of the time ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the work admirable, but the nature of the work it ſelf; it being againſt a moſt obſtinately-deſperate bloudy enemy, peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that had put themſelves out of all hopes of favour or mercy, by acting the moſt bloudy Tragedie that ever hath been ſeen or related, in that their univerſal Maſſacre of the Engliſh, yet recent in memory.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:54215:46"/>
There remained now onely <hi>Limerick, Waterford,</hi> and ſome few inconſiderable Gariſons, to be reduced; which being done, they might finde leaſure to hunt the wilde Iriſh, who were fled for refuge among their Boggs. This was left to the charge of <hi>Ireton,</hi> whom the Lord Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour having conſtituted Lord <hi>Deputy,</hi> he takes leave of <hi>Ireland;</hi> and committing himſelf to the Sea, arrived ſafely (after a boiſterous paſſage) at <hi>Bristol,</hi> where he was received with a thrice-repeated Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of great Guns, and other ſuitable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations of joy. Hence, without tarrying, he poſts for <hi>London:</hi> drawing neer <hi>Hounſlow-</hi>Heath, he is there met by the Lord General <hi>Fairfax,</hi> accompanied by many Members of Parliament and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the Army, with multitudes that came out of curioſity, to ſee him, of whom Fame had made ſuch a loud report. Hence, after mutual ſalutations, congratulations, and other teſtimonies of high reſpect, he proceeds on; and paſſing neer <hi>Hide-park-</hi>corner, he is ſaluted with great Guns, and ſeveral Volleys of ſmall Shot, by Colonel <hi>Barkstead</hi>'s Regiment, which was drawn up in the High-way for that
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:54215:47"/>
purpoſe. Continuing thus their march, (multitudes increaſing to behold him) the Lord <hi>Cromwel</hi> is conducted to the houſe called the <hi>Cock-pit,</hi> neer St. <hi>James,</hi> which had been appointed and prepared for him. Here he was viſited by the Lord Maior and Aldermen of <hi>London,</hi> and by many other perſons of quality, all of them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing their own and the Nations great obligations to him for his great Services in <hi>Ireland.</hi> After ſome time of reſpite and refreſhment, he attended his charge in Parliament, where the Speaker in an elegant Speech gave him the thanks of the Houſe. Which being ended, the Lord <hi>Cromwel</hi> gave them an account of the preſent ſtate of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of their Forces both in Field and Gariſon, with what deſignes they were now upon; what ſtrength the Enemy had, and what Gariſons were then in their power.</p>
               <p>The Parliament being thus aſſured of the hopeful condition of <hi>Ireland,</hi> began now wiſely to provide for the ſecurity of the peace of <hi>England,</hi> which was now in danger of diſturbance, partly by open Hoſtility, and partly by the under-hand
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:54215:47"/>
dealing of ſome pretended friends. <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> protects Prince <hi>Rupert</hi>'s Fleet, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the League: <hi>France</hi> domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers at Sea, making prize of all the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh they could bring under their power. About this time, the Parliament ſends Dr. <hi>Doriſlaus</hi> as an Agent to the States of the United Provinces, for the beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and continuance of a right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and fair correſpondence betwixt the two Republicks; where, not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his arrival, he was baſely ſlain by ſix Aſſaſſinates, who ruſhed into his lodgings at the <hi>Hague</hi> in diſguiſe, and eſcaped un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed, although the States pretended they had uſed their utmoſt endeavour to take them. In <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> the Engliſh Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants were much affronted by that Duke, by reaſon of his adherence to the Houſe of <hi>Stuarts. Virginia</hi> and the <hi>Caribes</hi> I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlands revolted from their obedience to the Parliament, being very hot for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy and the Liturgie. Nearer home, <hi>Scilly, Jerſey,</hi> and the <hi>Iſle of Man,</hi> ſtand out, and miſerably infeſt the Seas with their Piracie. But above all, the Scots were the moſt formidable, who ſeemed to ſet their wits on the tenters, that ſo
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:54215:48"/>
they might embroyl <hi>England</hi> in new trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and thereby have opportunity to work their ends upon it. To this end, a Treaty is commenced betwixt them and their King, at <hi>Breda,</hi> a famous Town in the Netherlands belonging to the Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi> Here they propoſe,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That his Majestie recal and diſclaim all Commiſsions and Declarations granted by him to the prejudice of the Covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That he acknowledge their preſent Parliament, and the two last Seſsions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and allow of the Acts made therein.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>They remonſtrate the Motives con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the eleventh Inſtruction;</hi> mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xbridge-</hi>Treaty.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>That as ſoon as he comes into</hi> Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>and before his admiſſion to the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Royal power, he ſhall ſwear, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe, and ſeal the National Covenant, and the Solemn League and Covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their King having aſſented, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed <hi>in verbo Principis</hi> to perform theſe things; the Commiſſioners had order to let him ſee the Coronation-Oath he was to take; which he approving, they were to invite him into <hi>Scotland,</hi> aſſuring him
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:54215:48"/>
that he ſhould be entertained there, with all due reſpect.</p>
               <p>To all which things the King at laſt condeſcended, partly by the perſwaſion of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> (at whoſe coſt and charges the Treaty was both begun and continued) and partly, upon hopes that by this means he might gain the eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er footing in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Scots being now impatient of the enjoyment of their King; preſence; he, in order to their ſatisfaction herein, haſtes from <hi>Breda</hi> towards the <hi>Hague,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Scheveling,</hi> where he took ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and not long after, landed (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſeveral ſnares laid for him) at the <hi>Spey</hi> in the North of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Parliament in <hi>England</hi> were not ignorant of theſe things; they having faithful Scouts abroad in the world, who failed not to give them timely notice of the machinations of their enemies in all quarters. And taking the matter into conſideration in the Houſe, a great debate there was, VVhether the war (for, that there muſt be a war betwixt us and our <hi>dear Brethren,</hi> was taken for granted) ſhould be <hi>Offenſive</hi> or <hi>Defenſive.</hi> As to
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:54215:49"/>
the later, (the Defenſive part) they were very ſenſible of the havock the Scots had formerly made in the North of <hi>England,</hi> when they came in as friends; ſo that ſhould they be ſuffered to come in as ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, nothing could be expected to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, but ruine and deſolation whereſoever they came. <hi>Hamilton</hi>'s Invaſion likewiſe ſtuck in their ſtomacks, and the devaſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that accompanied it. Beſides, it was conſidered, that to let them give the firſt blow, had been to make our own Country the ſeat of war; and thereby an opportunity would be given to diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented ſpirits here (which then were not a few) to joyn with the enemy. Upon theſe and other weighty conſiderations, the Parliament reſolves upon an Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive war, and to alarm them in their own Quarters. This Reſolution was thought moſt advantageous, in many reſpects: as,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Scotland</hi> (the Enemies Country) muſt needs be much impoveriſhed, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing burdened with two Armies, when it could not well maintain one; and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> would be quit of much fear and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity incident to quartering of Armies. Beſides, in all encounters, it is good po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:54215:49"/>
to keep an adverſary at the arms end.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By invading <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Souldiery would be much encouraged, in reſpect of the benefit might accrue to them by the ſpoils of their enemies. Hereby alſo the Territories of this Commonwealth were likely to be enlarged.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Scots Levies were not yet fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, nor their Army completed; ſo that a ſudden march might nip them in the bud, and prevent their further increaſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It was neceſſary to have a ſpecial regard to, and warchful eye upon <hi>Scotland,</hi> becauſe (by reaſon of its contiguity) no Enemy could be ſo obnoxious to <hi>England</hi> as it: and how ready they have been to lay hold on all opportunities to diſturb the peace of <hi>England,</hi> frequent examples teſtifie, both of former and later times. And unleſs that back-door were pin'd up, as great miſchiefs were like to be let in thereby, now, as ever.</p>
               <p>In order therefore to their former Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, the Parliament provide for a war: they order the Army to march Northwards, to ſit upon the skirts of the Scots. But Sir <hi>Tho. Fairfax</hi> (their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:54215:50"/>
at that time) being it ſeems not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in the thing, (as many others like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe were not) deſired to be excuſed, and laid down his Commiſſion. VVhich acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his bred conſternation in moſt, and ſeveral deſcants were given thereupon: the Plebeian rout (whoſe tribunal nothing of moment can paſs) judged the reaſon to be, that he durſt not venture to abide the guſt of thoſe Northern blaſts. But wiſe men know how much vulgar bruits are to be heeded; and that notwithſtanding what was ſaid then, or can be ſaid now, the trumpet of his fame ſhall not be put to ſilence; nor ſhall Time it ſelf be able to wipe his name into oblivion.</p>
               <p>The Parliament being thus diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are to ſeek for a General to command their Army; but for that they need not go far, ſince they had then amongſt them the moſt renowned <hi>Cromwel,</hi> of whoſe proweſs and faithfulneſs they had had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold experience, and who, upon their requeſt, did accept of the Charge: upon which, they give him a Commiſſion, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by impowering him to command all the Forces raiſed and to be raiſed in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth of <hi>England;</hi> annulling all
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:54215:50"/>
Commiſſions formerly granted to the Lord <hi>Fairfax.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cromwel</hi> being thus inveſted with pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, preſently addreſſes to the vvork; and in order thereunto, he took his journey towards the Army in the North, <hi>June</hi> 28. 1650. As he paſſed, great demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of reſpect were given him by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of the people. <hi>July</hi> 4. he arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at <hi>York,</hi> attended by many great Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the Army. No ſooner vvas he entred that City, but the Lord Maior, Aldermen and Sheriffs gave him an invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to a ſtately Dinner, expreſſing how much they joyed in the preſence of ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned an Hero. But he remembring that it was Fighting and not Feaſting that he came about, tarried there no longer then to order ſupplies for the Army, and expedite their Rendezvous.</p>
               <p>By this time, the Committee of Eſtates in <hi>Scotland</hi> was alarmed, inſomuch that they were frighted into an Expoſtulation with the Parliament; thinking thereby to protract time, till their Levies were perfected: to that end, they ſent a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Speaker by Col. <hi>Grey,</hi> to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:54215:51"/>
                  <hi>That they wondered at the report of the Engliſh Armies advance towards their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that many of their Ships were ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed and ſecured by the Engliſh, contrary to the Act of Pacification in the large Treaty, which provided that no acts of Hoſtility ſhould be uſed againſt each other, without three months warning beforehand; and that thoſe Forces which they were raiſing, were onely for their own defence: and therefore they deſired to know if the Forces of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>now on their march Northward, were intended for Offence or Defence; to guard their own borders, or invade</hi> Scotland.</p>
               <p>Papers of like import were alſo ſent to the Governour of <hi>Newcastle,</hi> Major Gen. <hi>Lambert,</hi> and the Lord General <hi>Cromwel.</hi> The Parliament anſwered them by a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration ſhewing the Grounds and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of their Armies advance, vvith the equity and neceſſity thereof. Their Grounds and Reaſons vvere theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <q>For that the Scots endeavoured to ſeduce the people of the Commonwealth of <hi>England</hi> from their affection and duty to the Parliament, and to promote the Intereſt of the late King, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Covenant.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:54215:51"/>
2. <q>In that they took <hi>Berwick</hi> and <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſle,</hi> and put Gariſons into them, in the year 1648. contrary to the large Treaty in 1640. and this done by the Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> even whilſt Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Commiſſioners were at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> offering to endeavour the compoſing of all differences betwixt the Nations by a Treaty; which they refuſed.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But foraſmuch as every quarrel that is lawful, is not neceſſary, (for in ſome caſes injuries are to be paſſed by, or at leaſt to be compoſed by Treaty:) therefore they proceed to declare the Neceſſity alſo of their preſent Expedition; which they thus grounded.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>All reparations of the damages done by the <hi>Scots</hi> in their late Invaſion, have been denied to be given in a fair way by their Parliament: vvhereby they have owned the vvrongs done thereby.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That they have a deſigne again to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade us; which appears thus:</q>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <q>In that, upon the Engliſh their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding a Treaty for ſatisfaction of the injuries done in their late Invaſion, they in expreſs terms declared themſelves e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to this Commonwealth.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:54215:52"/>
2. <q>In that, although they could not claim to themſelves any Authority or Dominion over us, yet in <hi>Scotland</hi> they proclaimed <hi>Charles Stuart</hi> to be King of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> and ſince that, promiſed to aſſiſt him againſt this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <q>In that, vvhen upon preparation in <hi>Scotland</hi> for <hi>Hamiltons</hi> Invaſion of <hi>England,</hi> the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> ſent Commiſſioners to treat of an Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation, to prevent effuſion of bloud; they declined the Treaty, and in ſtead thereof an Army ſpeedily marcheth into <hi>England.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <q>In that they declared againſt the Engliſh Parliament and Army as Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, ranking them vvith Malignants and Papiſts.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe provocations being intolerable, and no ſatisfaction being to be had, but vvhat the Sword muſt procure; the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament reſolve upon that courſe, vvhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by (ſeeing no other expedient could effect it) to vindicate the Nations honour, and to ſecure it againſt the like inſolencies for the time to come.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:54215:52"/>
This Declaration was quickly ſeconded by another from the Lord General and his Army, which they directed to the well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and was to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>That they being to advance into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> for the ends expreſſed in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Declaration of <hi>June</hi> 26. they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the practices of ſome in that Kingdom, whoſe deſignes are by unjuſt reproaches and falſe ſlanders to make the Army odious, and render them to be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther monſters then men: Therefore, to clear themſelves, they could do no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then re-minde them of their beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour when they were before in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> what injury or wrong was then done, either to the perſons, houſes, or goods of any: conſidering this, it was hoped that ſuch their former demeanour would not be forgotten, nor the preſent reports affright the people from their habitations.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To ſatisfie them further, the Lord Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and the Army declared (from the integrity of their hearts) <q>That ſuch of the Gentry and Commonalty as inhabit

where the Army may come, they being none of thoſe who by their counſels laid the foundation of a ſecond Invaſion, or cloſed with him who hath endeavoured to engage forraign Princes againſt the Commonwealth of <hi>England,</hi> and hath exerciſed actual Hoſtility, by commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating Pyrates to ſpoil the ſhips and goods belonging thereto; to theſe, not the leaſt violence or injury ſhould be offered either in body or goods; or if any ſhould happen, that upon complaint made, redreſs and ſatisfaction ſhould im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately be had. Wherefore they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire all perſons to abide in their habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, aſſuring them to enjoy what they had without diſturbance.</q>
               </p>
               <p>No ſooner was this penned, but copies thereof were ſent into <hi>Scotland;</hi> and the Country-people that kept Market at <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi> had their pockets ſtuffed with them, to carry home and diſperſe among their neighbours.</p>

to undeceive the Scots, and to procure their good opinion of him and his Army; conſidered, that all would not be convinced thereby; the Sword, not the Pen, muſt perſwade many of them: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he leaves <hi>York,</hi> and haſtes to <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allerton,</hi> and thence the next day to <hi>Darn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</hi> As he paſs'd by this place, the Train of Artillery (which was quartered here) ſaluted him with ſeven Pieces of Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. Coming next to <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> the Governour Sir <hi>Arthur Haſlerig</hi> received him with noble entertainment. Here the Lord General and the Officers of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in a ſolemn manner implored a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from heaven upon their preſent Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition. After which, upon due conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the affairs of the Army, he ſetled a way for their ſupply from time to time with proviſions. This buſineſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſpatched, and the general Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous appointed, the Lord General leaves <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and poſts for <hi>Berwick.</hi> His Forces being all come up, he cauſed a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Rendezvous of them to be on <hi>Hag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerſton-</hi>Moor, four miles from <hi>Berwiek. July</hi> 20. 1650, the whole Army was drawn into the Field; which was no ſooner
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:54215:54"/>
done, but the General himſelf came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, being received with ſhouting and other ſignes of joy. Having well view'd them, he cauſed both Horſe and Foot to be drawn up in <hi>Battalia.</hi> Which being done, there appeared a gallant Body of Horſe, conſiſting of 5415, beſtrid by as many ſtout and couragious Riders; eight complete Regiments of Foot, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting (with their Officers) of 10249; with the Train of Artillery, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of 690: ſo that the Army in the whole, conſiſted of 16354. A ſight moſt lovely, and very deſirable, to ſee ſuch an Army of men, (gallantly accoutred, and provided with all neceſſaries) who for ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved valour are not to be equal'd; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by a General, whom no example ancient or modern can parallel, for Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Conduct: in a word, he was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored in his Army, and they happie in their General. Being thus in <hi>Battalia,</hi> the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral marcheth them about an hundred paces towards <hi>Berwick,</hi> and ſo diſmiſſeth them to their quarters on the brink of <hi>Tweed,</hi> where we ſhall leave them for the preſent, expecting their further advance.</p>

               <head>HIS WARS IN SCOTLAND.</head>
               <p>OCcaſion might here be taken to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire at the long continued ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that hath been betwixt <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> that notwithſtanding they are cohabitants of the ſame Iſland, yet they ſhould continue diſtinct Kingdoms for ſo many Ages together. For whereas divers Kingdoms having inferious Dominions in them, ſoon ſubjected them to their own Rule, (as in <hi>Spain,</hi> where many Kingdoms are concorporated into one; and in our own Nation, where the Saxon Heptarchy was long ſince reduced into a Monarchy) yet <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> could never be united under one Head, till the Crown of <hi>England</hi> devolved upon King <hi>James.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Many attempts have been made by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Engliſh Kings, to reduce <hi>Scotland</hi> to
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:54215:55"/>
their obedience. <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond (a King whoſe greateſt honour was, to be the ſon of an Heroick father, and father to an incomparable ſon) unfortunately fought the Battel at <hi>Bannocks</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> where (as <hi>Holinſhed</hi> relates) was loſt <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert de Clare</hi> Earl of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> 40 Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons, 700 Knights and Gentlemen, and about 40000 others. This defeat was great, even the greateſt that ever the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh received at one time from that Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But in hopes to wipe away this blur, and to ſalve up this wound, the King rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed two great Armies for that purpoſe; but with no better ſucceſs: for the firſt of his Armies was loſt for want of courage to fight; the laſt, for want of food, was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to retire, and in their retreat loſt all their Ammunition. But what elſe could be expected from a puſillanimous King, who was obſerved in the former Battel to be the firſt that fled? for it could not be expected that the Souldiers ſhould ſtand, they being bound to follow their leader.</p>
               <p>To reckon up all the Rencoùnters that have happened betwixt the two Nations, would be too tedious, and ſtretch this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe beyond its intended length. Yet
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:54215:55"/>
I ſhall wade a little in theſe plaſhes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I plunge into the Ocean of <hi>Cromwels</hi> Conqueſts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, a wiſe and valiant Prince, was much diſturbed by thoſe two Impoſtors, <hi>Perkin Warbeck</hi> and <hi>Lambert Simnel. Warbeck</hi>'s quarrel was eſpouſed by the Scots, but to little purpoſe: for a Peace was ſoon concluded betwixt the two Kings, on condition that <hi>Warbeck</hi> ſhould be ſent packing, and that <hi>James</hi> the fourth the Scots King ſhould marry the Lady <hi>Margret</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi>'s daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Great debate was in the Council a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this Match: ſome were againſt it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadging, that in caſe the Kings iſſue ſhould fail, <hi>England</hi> would become ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to <hi>Scotland.</hi> But to this the King wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly returned: That the weaker muſt ever bow to the ſtronger; and <hi>England</hi> being the ſtronger, <hi>Scotland</hi> muſt ſubmit. This was but diſcourſe: for it could not be then imagined, (the King having two hopeful ſons, <hi>Arthur</hi> and <hi>Henry)</hi> that the Lady <hi>Margret</hi> ſhould be the Royal Stem from whence ſhould ſpring thoſe Noble branches which were to over-ſpread both Nations, as it afterwards came to paſs in
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:54215:56"/>
King <hi>James.</hi> But notwithſtanding the Alliance made by the ſaid Marriage, in the days of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth (while he was buſied with his Wars in <hi>France)</hi> the Scots invade <hi>England,</hi> and were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred by the Earl of <hi>Surrey</hi> at <hi>Flodden</hi> Field, where the ſucceſs remained doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a great while: but at laſt, the Victory fell to the Engliſh, who that day ſlew the Scots King, the Biſhop of <hi>St. Andrews,</hi> 12 Earls, 14 Barons, and 12000 Gentlemen and common Souldiers; onely with the loſs of 1500. at ſo eaſie a rate was this great Victory purchaſed. By this and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Blows, King <hi>Henry</hi> got many of the Scotiſh Nobility into his cuſtody. And conſidering how their frequent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions did impede and fruſtrate his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes abroad, he thought it expedient to uſe a means to beget amity betwixt the Nations; to which end, he propounded a Match betwixt his ſon <hi>Edward,</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> the young Princeſs of <hi>Scotland.</hi> This mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion found ſo good acceptance at firſt, that it was concluded upon, and ratified by Act of Parliament, with a ſpecial Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under the hands of the Scotiſh No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility; who by this means having gotten
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:54215:56"/>
their liberty from reſtraint, ſoon after quit themſelves of their former engagement, and eſpouſed their young Lady to the Dolphin of <hi>France:</hi> which ſo enraged our young King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, (his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Henry</hi> being dead) that he reſolved,
<q>
                     <l>Seeing the Foxes skin could not prevail,</l>
                     <l>To piece it with the Lions tayl.</l>
                  </q>
And to that end, ſends an Army under the Duke of <hi>Somerſet</hi> into <hi>Scotland,</hi> to avenge himſelf on them for their perfidious deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. This Army exceeded not 18000 in number; (too ſmall in appearance to deal with a whole Kingdom:) but greatneſs of courage ſupplying the paucity of their number, they encountered the Scots neer <hi>Muſcleborough,</hi> where (notwithſtanding they doubled the Engliſh in multitude, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides 3000 Monks, Fryers and Kirk-men, armed both with VVord and Sword) they got the day, and obtained a moſt compleat Victory. But while they beat the buſh, the bird was flown into <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here many of the Scotiſh Nobility were taken priſoners; one of which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought to the Engliſh General, and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:54215:57"/>
asked by him how he liked the Match, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered wittily, <hi>Very well, but not that manner of wooing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Battel, and that of <hi>Flodden-</hi>field, (four and thirty years before) were both fought upon the Ninth of <hi>September;</hi> as afterwards thoſe of <hi>Worceſter</hi> and <hi>Dunbar</hi> were both upon the Third of the ſame month: ſo that that month ſeems to be more ominous to the Scotiſh Nation, then any in the whole Kalendar.</p>
               <p>This Digreſſion hath been made, onely to ſhew what endeavours there have been all along to unite theſe Kingdoms under one Head: but nothing could effect it, until King <hi>James</hi> came in by ſucceſſion, he being ſon to that Queen <hi>Mary</hi> formerly eſpouſed to <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth.</p>
               <p>This Line was thought perpetual, and the Tye indiſſoluble, according to the Motto upon King <hi>James</hi> his Coyn; <hi>Que Deus conjunxit, nemo ſeparet.</hi> But he that <hi>rules in the Kingdoms of men,</hi> hath been pleaſed to over-rule their deſigns, by a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den cutting off of that Line, and diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that League which was eſteemed ſo inviolable. By this means, the Scots be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to play <hi>Rex,</hi> (as we have heard in
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:54215:57"/>
part already:) but how and by whom they were reduced under the obedience and ſubjection of the Engliſh (as at this day) is our next work to ſhew; they being (as ſings ingenious Mr. <hi>Waller</hi>'s Panegyrick)
<q>
                     <l>A Race unconquer'd, by their Clime made bold,</l>
                     <l>The <hi>Caledonians</hi> arm'd with want and cold,</l>
                     <l>Have by a Fate indulgent to his fame,</l>
                     <l>Been, from all Ages, kept for him to tame:</l>
                     <l>Whom the old <hi>Roman</hi> wall ſo ill confin'd,</l>
                     <l>With a new Chain of Gariſons he binde.</l>
                     <l>Here forraign Gold no more ſhall make them come;</l>
                     <l>For <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s <hi>Iron</hi> holds them fast at home.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cromwel</hi> was the man by whom this ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious work was wrought, who being now conſtituted Generaliſſimo for the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> (as we have ſeen before) made this improvement of his new honour, adding this Conqueſt to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Heroick atchievements. And what order he obſerved in the carrying on of this buſineſs, we ſhall now relate, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning where we left off before.</p>
               <p>The Army being come up all together in a Body, and quartered upon the very
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:54215:58"/>
edge of <hi>Scotland,</hi> (as afore is ſhewed) on <hi>July</hi> 22. 1650, the Lord General drew them forth to a Rendezvous upon a hill within <hi>Berwick</hi> bounds, from whence they had a full view of the adjacent parts of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Stage whereon they were to act their parts in the enſuing Tragedies. Here he made a Speech to his Souldiers, exhorting them to be faithful and coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious; and then not to doubt of a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from God, and all encouragement from himſelf: which was anſwered with loud and unanimous Acclamations from them; who going thus chearfully about their work, it was the more likely to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper in their hands, as indeed it did.</p>
               <p>Upon this, the Lord General marches his Army into <hi>Scotland,</hi> quartering them that night in the field neer <hi>Mordington;</hi> where he cauſed it to be proclaimed tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowout the Camp, (for the better conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of good order and diſcipline) That none on pain of death ſhould offer vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence or injury to the perſons or goods of any in <hi>Scotland</hi> not in Arms; and withal, That no Souldier ſhould preſume (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpecial licenſe) to ſtraggle half a mile from the Army. Hence they diſlodge for
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:54215:58"/>
                  <hi>Copperſpeith;</hi> thence to <hi>Dunbar,</hi> where they are recruited with proviſions from the Engliſh ſhips ſent thither for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; the Country affording them none: for the Scotch Eſtates had taken a courſe beforehand, to ſweep all the Country be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Berwick</hi> and <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> of all things that might yeeld any comfort or ſuccour to the Engliſh.</p>
               <p>But this entertainment was not at all ſtrange to the Engliſh, it being but what they expected; neither did it in the leaſt appal or diſcourage them Their next remove is to <hi>Handington,</hi> twelve miles from <hi>Edinburgh:</hi> and all this, without the leaſt oppoſition, not ſeeing all this while the face of an Enemy in Arms. But although they could not be ſeen, yet they were heard of, giving out that they would meet the Engliſh at <hi>Gladſmore.</hi> The Lord General prepared to meet them accordingly; and knowing his adverſary exceeded him in number, he laboured to poſſeſs the Moor before them, to gain the advantage of ground, in caſe they ſhould meet him; which it ſeems they never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, having no great ſtomack to fight. Upon this, Major-Gen. <hi>Lambert</hi> and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:54215:59"/>
                  <hi>Whalley</hi> (men of approved courage and valour) with 1400 Horſe, were ſent as a Van-guard to <hi>Muſcleborough:</hi> Major <hi>Hayns</hi> commanding the Forlorn, fac'd the Scots within a mile of their Trenches. The next day, the Lord General with the main Body drew up before <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> where ſome bickering happened about the poſſeſſion of King <hi>Arthur</hi>'s Hill, a place within a mile of that Citie; which the Engliſh obtained, and ſoon after poſſeſt themſelves of a Church, and certain hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. But notwithſtanding all theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations, the Scots would not forſake their Trenches, but lay upon the catch: and according to the Proverb, <hi>Harm watch, harm catch,</hi> ſo it fell out with them. For the Lord General ſeeing no good to be done this way, and that his Army was much wearied out with hard duty and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual rain, drawing off to <hi>Muſcleborough,</hi> there to refreſh and recruit his men with proviſions; the Scots would needs have one ſnap at parting, and to that end came powdering down upon the laſt Reſerve of the Engliſh Rere-guard, and had like to have over-run them: but Major-General <hi>Lambert,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Whalley,</hi> with his
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:54215:59"/>
giment, came in to their reſcue, routing the Scots, and purſuing them to their Trenches.</p>
               <p>In this Encounter, <hi>Lambert</hi> received two wounds; and the reſt came not off altogether Scot-free: for they left behind them one Lieutenant-Colonel, one Major, and ſome Captains, with a few private ſouldiers for company. By this defeat, the Engliſh had an opportunity to march off quietly to <hi>Muſcleborough</hi> that night, although in a wet and weary condition, expecting alſo every moment to be ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as indeed at laſt they were: for Col. <hi>Straughan</hi> and <hi>Montgomery</hi> very ſlyly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them in the rere with the Kirk's Regiment of Horſe, and ſome others, to the number of 1500. all armed with Backs, Breſts, Head-pieces, Piſtols, Swords and Lances; as if they had intended to inflict ſome ſtrange new-faſhion'd deaths upon the Engliſh.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>July</hi> 30. about three or four in the morning, <hi>Straughan</hi> gave a furious Cami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſado on a Body of the Engliſh in their quarters; which being ſudden, did ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what diſorder a Regiment of Horſe: but the Alarm being given, raiſed ſo many Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:54215:60"/>
ſpirits, that ſoon frighted away the Scots, purſuing them to their own homes. In this encounter were killed and taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 200 with ſeven Officers' of quality: <hi>Straughan</hi> himſelf, becauſe he could ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage his horſe no better, was fain to trip it on foot to <hi>Edinburgh</hi> with ſhame e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</p>
               <p>Here the Lord General, to let the Scots ſee what a generous Enemy they had to deal withal, diſcharged the chiefeſt of the priſoners taken, and ſent them to <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> in his own Coach: which not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begot him great applauſe, but tended much to the rectification of thoſe who had harboured ſo much prejudice againſt him, by reaſon of thoſe ſtrange reports broached of his pretended cruelty.</p>
               <p>Now the Armies proviſions being wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigh ſpent, they retire again to <hi>Dunbar,</hi> there to renew their ſupplies from the Ships attending for that purpoſe by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from the Engliſh Parliament; vvho knowing victuals to be the life of VVar, (money being onely the ſinews) took care to provide a continued courſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruits.</p>
               <p>After convenient ſupply and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:54215:60"/>
returned immediately towards <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinburgh,</hi> to accompany the Scots in their Rejoycing, they being then very ſeriouſly keeping a ſolemn Thankſgiving for their ſuppoſed great deliverance; imagining that the Engliſh Army was quite gone; as if they had come onely to ſee how they did, or whether <hi>Edinburgh</hi> ſtood where it did when they were there laſt. This un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected viſit ſpoiled their ſport, and made them change their none, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the preſence of their King, then but newly come thither from <hi>St. John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtons;</hi> who (although he had been lately crowned) had not a Crown in his pocket; the Kirk it ſeems thinking him not yet fit to be truſted with money, till he had more amply lamented the ſins of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and put on thoſe Yokes they were preparing for him; which he fearing would not prove very eaſie, made no haſte to take upon him.</p>
               <p>About this time, the General Aſſembly (with <hi>David Leſley</hi> their General) ſent to the Lord General <hi>Cromwel</hi> a Declaration (as <hi>Leſley</hi> call'd it) containing the ſtate of the Quarrel in which they were to fight, (as if they had ſuch a minde to it!) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:54215:61"/>
that this their Declaration might be publikely known. Whether their requeſt were fulfill'd then or no, I know not: I ſhall ſo far gratifie them now, as to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour the ſame, by reciting it briefly, as followeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>THat the General Aſſembly conſidering there might be just grounds of ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, from the Kings Majesties refuſing to ſubſcribe the Declaration concerning his former carriage, and reſolutions for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in reference to the Cauſe of God, the enemies and friends thereof; doth therefore declare, that the Kirk and Kingdom will not own any Malignant party their quarrel or intereſt, but that they will fight upon their former Principles, for the Cauſe of God, and their Kingdom: and therefore as they diſclaim all the ſin and guilt of the King and his Houſe, ſo they will not own him nor his Intereſt, any further then he ſhall diſclaim his and his fathers oppoſition to the work of God, and the enemies thereof: And withal, that they would with convenient ſpeed conſider of the Papers ſent to them from</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver Cromwel, <hi>and vindicate themſelves from the falſhoods contained therein.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:54215:61"/>
Very ſhort, but not very ſweet; it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries a ſting in its tayl. The imputation of <hi>falſhood</hi> might much more juſtly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly have been kept at home, all things conſidered. The Lord General <hi>Cromwel</hi> returns them this Anſwer:
<q>
                     <p>THat the Army continued the ſame they had profeſt themſelves to the honeſt people of <hi>Scotland,</hi> wiſhing to them as to their own ſouls; it being no part of their buſineſs to hinder them in the VVorſhip of God according to their Conſciences, as by his Word they ought: And that they ſhould be ready to perform what obligation lay upon them by the Covenant. But that under the pretence of the Covenant miſtaken, a King ſhould be taken in by them, and impoſed on the Engliſh, and this called <hi>The Cauſe of God and the Kingdom;</hi> and this done upon the ſatisfaction of Gods people in both Nations, as alleadged, together with a diſowning of Malignants, although the Head of them be received, who at this very inſtant hath a party fighting in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> at Sea on a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:54215:62"/>
account, the French and Iriſh ſhips daily making depredations upon the Engliſh coaſts, and all by vertue of his Commiſſions: and therefore the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my cannot believe, that whilſt Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants fighting and plotting againſt them on the one ſide, and the Scots declaring for him on the other, ſhould not be an eſpouſing of a Malignant Intereſt or Quarrel, but a meer fighting on former Grounds and Principles. If the ſtate of the Quarrel be thus, and you ſay you reſolve to fight the Army, you will have oportunity to do that, elſe what means our abode here? And our hope is in the Lord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus the cauſe of the VVar was ſtated, as if the Scots had been ignorant of the grounds and reaſons of the Engliſh Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies coming into their Country. Now there remains nothing but fighting: and how well they quit themſelves therein, is next to be ſhewn.</p>
               <p>The Lord General ſeeing that by no means he could provoke the Enemy to an engagement, (having ſufficiently victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alled his men at <hi>Muſcleborough) Aug.</hi>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:54215:62"/>
17. 1650, he advanced, and pitched his Camp on <hi>Pencland</hi> Hills. In this march, the Scots drew forth ſeveral Bodies of Horſe, and faced the Engliſh: but they were ſo wary as to keep out of harms way, not coming within Gun-ſhot. The Army having taken up their Quarters on the hills, two Troops of Dragoons are ſent out, to diſpoſſeſs the Enemy of <hi>Collington-</hi>Houſe. About this time, a Serjeant of Colonel <hi>Cox</hi> his Regiment (with three o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers his aſſociates) was called to account for plundering a houſe, and ſtealing a Cloak: which being proved, the Serje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant was condemned to be hang'd; and, notwithſtanding the ſcarcity of trees in thoſe parts, the Sentence was executed on him, for an example to others. The other three Souldiers found mercy, and obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed pardon. So careful was the General to preſerve the Country, according as he had promis'd them before in his Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p>Then the Scots drew forth on the weſt ſide of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> between the river <hi>Leith</hi> and the Sea, to the number of two or three thouſand Horſe; conceiving that the Army intended to poſſeſs a paſs over
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:54215:63"/>
the ſaid River. Which the Lord Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſeeing, he drew forth a Forlorn to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage them, himſelf in perſon leading, to ſhew the Scots his readineſs to fight them. Approaching near to their Body, one that knew the Lord General fired a Carbine at him, but timerouſly: which he ſeeing, called out and told him, That if he had been one of his Souldiers, he ſhould have been caſhier'd, for firing at that diſtance. But the truth is, theſe daring actions in Generals, ſavour more of valour then diſcretion: Bullets diſtinguiſh not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the meaneſt private Souldier, and the moſt puiſſant General, if he come in their way. Hence it was, that the people would not ſuffer <hi>David</hi> to go out in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. 'Twas upon an over-bold diſcovery of <hi>Popinham</hi>'s ſtrength, that <hi>Guſtavus A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolphus</hi> (the Scourge of the Auſtrians) was killed, and with him the hopes of thoſe great things expected from him. The Head of an Army (ſuch is the General) being once cut off, the Body (eſpecially in an enemies Country) muſt needs lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh and pine away.</p>
               <p>The Scots having done their buſineſs, which it ſeems was onely to breathe their
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:54215:63"/>
horſes, they returned back again to their Quarters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aug.</hi> 19. part of the Engliſh Army ſtormed <hi>Red-Hall,</hi> and took it; it being a Gariſon ſituate within a mile and a half of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> having about 80 Foot to defend it. This was done in the ſight of the Scots whole Army, yet not a man ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red towards the relief of the place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aug.</hi> 26, the Scots ſent to the Lord General, deſiring a Conference betwixt ſome of themſelves, and ſome Officers ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by him. Which being granted, and a convenient place appointed, the Lord <hi>Wariſton</hi> Secretary of State, Sir <hi>John Brown,</hi> Colonel <hi>Straughan,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glas</hi> a Miniſter, with certain others, atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for that purpoſe. The main buſineſs of their Meeting, was to wipe off a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended aſperſion caſt upon them, and ſpread over both Armies, intimating that they kept themſelves in Trenches and holes, not daring to fight. And the better to clear themſelves of theſe calumnies, they let the Engliſh know, That when op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity ſerved, it ſhould be ſeen that they wanted not courage to give them Battel.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:54215:64"/>
The next morning, the Scots (as if they meant to be as good as their words; which had they been, they had croſs'd a very ancient Proverb) ſtrike up for a march, ſeeming either to bend their courſe for <hi>Sterling,</hi> or as if they would in good earneſt (according to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the Embaſſage they had ſent the day before, leſt it ſhould not be known) fight the Engliſh.</p>
               <p>No ſooner are they on their march, but the Lord General prepares to meet them, thinking that although they had often dallied with him before, yet now ſurely they would be ſerious, and ſhew ſome fair play. The common ſouldiers were poſſeſt with the like apprehenſions, being over-joy'd at the very thoughts of fighting; and in order thereunto, they preſently take down their Tents, lay aſide their Knapſacks, and disburthen themſelves of every thing whatſoever that might be an impediment to their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctivity.</p>
               <p>Being thus prepared, the Engliſh ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the Scots Army, verily intending to engage them: but it ſeems they had no minde to come to it, but rather to
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:54215:64"/>
ſhelter themſelves in ſome new lurking hole, (notwithſtanding their late confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent diſclaiming of any ſuch practice.) Accordingly, when the Engliſh drew neer the Enemy, they found a great Bog and a deep Ditch to make ſuch a ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as for the preſent cut off all poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of conjunction with them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently of engaging them, without running ſuch hazards as were not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry at that time. The Lord General ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he could not come at them in perſon, ſent a thundring meſſage to them by the mouth of his Cannon.</p>
               <p>All that night, both the Armies conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in Arms; and the next morning, being the 28 of <hi>August,</hi> the great Guns roared on both ſides, for about the ſpace of an hour. But the Engliſh Lord Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſeeing that this would do no good, and knowing that it would but waſte precious time to no purpoſe, to ſtand pelting at an Enemy at that diſtance, he therefore drew off from thence, to try ſome other concluſion, if by any means he might get the Enemy into a fair field, where the buſineſs might be diſputed on equal terms. In order to which, marching
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:54215:65"/>
towards their former Quarters on <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cland</hi> hills, no ſooner were they there ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, but news came that the Scots were upon their march to poſſeſs <hi>Muſclebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough</hi> and <hi>Preston-pans,</hi> whereby to cut off proviſions from the Engliſh Army. The ſouldiers hearing this, begin to beſtir themſelves; and again taking down their Tents, take up their Arms; holding it to be high time ſo to do, conſidering that now they muſt either fight or ſtarve.</p>
               <p>To prevent the Enemies deſigne, the Lord General advanced that night with his whole Army towards <hi>Muſcleborough,</hi> it being very ſtormy &amp; tempeſtuous wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, without any moleſtation from the Enemy. Being there, they are ſupply'd from the ſhips: and many of them being infirm and diſeaſed, by reaſon of hard du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and unſeaſonable weather; 500 were ſent on board; which yet did not clear the Army of thoſe diſtempered ones.</p>
               <p>The Enemy all this while dogging the Engliſh in the Rere, watched all opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities to diſtreſs, them. But the Lord General taking into conſideration the ſad condition of his Army, occaſioned by ſickneſs and indiſpoſition of body, reſolves
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:54215:65"/>
to retreat with them to <hi>Dunhar,</hi> and there (by Gariſoning it) to lie ſecurely for ſome time, till they might recover ſtrength, and receive convenient recruits both of Horſe and Foot from <hi>Berwick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In purſuance of this reſolution, the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my <hi>(Aug.</hi> 30.) ſet forward toward <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dington.</hi> And by that time the van-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gade of Horſe had taken up their quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the Scots (by a nimble march) were fallen in the rere, and put them into diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: But wanting courage to proſecute the advantage; and withal, a cloud over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhadowing the Moon, gave the Engliſh Horſe an opportunity to inextricate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of that Labyrinth wherein they had like to have been entangled, and to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the main Body.</p>
               <p>Being at <hi>Hadington,</hi> in danger to be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted daily by the Enemy, the Lord Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral cauſed a ſtrict Watch to be kept, to prevent the worſt. For the Scots were ſufficiently ſenſible of the crazie condition of the Army, and thought they had now an opportunitie to diſtreſs them, (they acting the Offenſive part) that and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees they ſhould weary them out, and at laſt utterly deſtroy them: and to that
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:54215:66"/>
end, (conceiving that now they had a more then ordinary advantage) about midnight, <hi>Aug.</hi> 30. they attempted the Engliſh quarters on the weſt-end of the Town. But notwithſtanding their confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, they were ſoon ſet further off.</p>
               <p>The next day, the Lord General draws out into the open Champaign on the South-ſide of the Town, reſolving (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the indiſpoſition of body in his Army) to venture all upon the event of a Battel. But the Scots having no minde to that ſport, therefore (after three hours tarriance in expectation of their coming, all in vain) the Engliſh proſecute their fore-intended march for <hi>Dunbar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Scots being re-inforced with the addition of three Regiments, yet again came in the Rere of the Engliſh; and ſeeing them lodg'd in <hi>Dunbar,</hi> gathered upon the adjacent hills like a thick cloud, menacing ſuch a ſhowre to the Engliſh, as would waſh them out of their Country, if not out of the world: and to make ſure work, (imagining they had them now in a Pound) they being well acquainted with the Country, ſet a ſtrong Guard upon the Paſs at <hi>Copperſpeith,</hi> (a place where ten
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:54215:66"/>
ſtout men may obſtruct the paſſage of fourty) thereby to intercept or hinder all proviſions or relief from <hi>Berwick,</hi> or perhaps to hinder the Engliſh from run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning away, leſt any thing ſhould be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to compleat their (imagined) neer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching Victory. For (as a late ingenious <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>R H.</hi> his diſcourſe of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </note> Author hath it, writing upon this ſubject) <hi>The Scots from thoſe high hills that encompaſſed this ſickly remnant, and which they had poſſeſſed themſelves of, look down on the Engliſh as their ſure prey.</hi> But (as the ſame Author goes on) <hi>how much better had they done, had they levelled thoſe mountains which ſurrounded their wretched enemies, and which proved ſuch ſleight de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences against a vertue backt with neceſſity, and ſo made them an eaſier paſſage to their hom<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>

                     </gap>ant it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And no marvel the Scots were thus confident. For beſides that they were ſtout and hearty, in their own Country, and upon advantageous ground, (in all which reſpects the Engliſh were at a loſs) they doubled the Engliſh in number; they being 6000 Horſe &amp; 16000 Foot, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:54215:67"/>
the other were but 7500 Foot &amp; 3500 Horſe. Two to one is great oddes; and yet (as the caſe then ſtood) they muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fight manfully, or tamely give up themſelves a prey to their inſulting Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; which the Engliſh not having been accuſtomed to do, knew not how to begin now. Neither did all theſe ſtraights, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties and diſadvantages in the leaſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>may the Lord General, who as a Rock re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained immoveable in this Sea of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; and who, conſidering that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent neceſſity required more then an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary courage, and that this muſt be his Maſter piece or Misfortune, after he had well view'd the Enemy, and found that they had drawn down about: two thirds of their Left wing of Horſe to the Right, cauſing them to edge down toward the Sea, ſhogging alſo their Foot and Train to the Right, (a poſture not well to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, unleſs it were by this means to make ſhort work, and to catch the Engliſh as it were in a Purſe-net) ſaw that it was no time to uſe many words, and that ſmall debates muſt produce great actions: and therefore after a ſhort conſultation had with his chief Officers, it was concluded,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:54215:67"/>
to take ſuch a courſe as might let the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſee it was in vain for them to go about to abridge them of their liberty, by any power or policie that they could uſe.</p>
               <p>The better to do this, the Lord Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral drew forth ſix Regiments of Horſe, with three Regiments and a half of Foot, to march in the Van: the Horſe were commanded by Major-General <hi>Lambert,</hi> and Lieutenant-General <hi>Fleetwood;</hi> the Foot, by Commiſſary-General <hi>Whalley,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Monk.</hi> To ſecond theſe, were Colonel <hi>Pride</hi>'s Brigade, and Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Overton</hi>'s Brigade. Two Regiments of Horſe moreover brought up the Rere, with the Cannon.</p>
               <p>All things being thus in a readineſs, the Souldiers deſired nothing more, then the coming of the time when they ſhould fall on, that ſo they might ſhew their Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour to purpoſe. It was reſolved <hi>(Sept.</hi> 3.) to fall on by break of day: but (by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſome impediments) it was delayed till ſix of the clock; at which time, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor-General <hi>Lambert,</hi> Lieutenant-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Fleetwood,</hi> Commiſſary <hi>Whalley,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Twiſleton,</hi> (all ſtout reſolute Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders) gave a furious charge upon the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:54215:68"/>
Scots Army, who ſtoutly ſuſtained the ſame, and gallantly diſputed the buſineſs at the ſwords point. The Engliſh Foot in the mean time fired roundly upon the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies Foot, but with more courage then ſucceſs; for being over-powred, they were forc'd into ſome diſorder: notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, they ſoon recovered their ground, being reinforc'd by the Generals own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment.</p>
               <p>And now the Fight grew hot on all ſides. The Engliſh Horſe flew about like Furies, doing wonderful execution, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that the place ſoon became an <hi>Acel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dama,</hi> or field of bloud. The Foot were not behinde in their capacities: for the Pikes gallantly ſuſtained the puſh of their Enemies, and the Muskets ſeemed by their often firings to have a deſigne to alter the property of the Climate from the Frigid to the Torrid <hi>Zone.</hi> Neither were the Engliſh more free of their Powder, then the Scots (eſpecially <hi>Lawyers</hi> Regiment of Highlanders) were of their Bullets, until their Horſe being totally diſpers'd, and enforc'd to quit the Field, left the Foot expoſed to all dangers: which they ſeeing, began to ſhift for themſelves as
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:54215:68"/>
well as they could, throwing away their Arms, and betaking themſelves to their heels: a poor ſhift; it being better to fight a day, then run an hour. To be ſhort; the Engliſh at laſt ſo far prevailed, as to give a compleat Overthrow, by the utter routing of that Army, which had but lately triumphed in a confident aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Victory.</p>
               <p>This was the work of one hour; but it ended not here: for the Rout begetting a Run, the fugitives were purſued eight miles from the place. Of the Enemy were ſlain in all, about 3000; many pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners of quality taken, beſides 10000 private ſouldiers, with 15000 Arms, all their Train of Artillery, great and ſmall, the Leather-Guns not excepted: and for ſtanding Trophies of this great Victory, 200 of their Colours were ſent up to the Parliament at <hi>London,</hi> who cauſed them to be hung up in <hi>Westminſter-</hi>Hall, where they remain till this day.</p>
               <p>As Sea-ſick paſſengers in a boiſterous Ocean, receive as it were new life and ſpirit upon ſafe arrival at their deſired Port: ſo the Engliſh Army, who had been toſſed up and down in a ſtrange Country,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:54215:69"/>
and almoſt ſpent by hard duty and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſutableneſs of the Climate, were now revived by this miraculous Victory. And the Lord General ſeeing their courage to be up, reſolved it ſhould not flat for want of exerciſe; and therefore (the better al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to improve this Victory, and to ſecure what he had gotten) he diſpatches away <hi>Lambert</hi> with ſix Regiments of Horſe and nine of Foot, to attaque <hi>Edinburgh</hi> the Metropolis of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and ſecure <hi>Leith,</hi> that ſo the Engliſh ſhips might thence readily and without obſtruction yeeld ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary ſupplies to the Army. The Lord General himſelf remained ſome ſmall time at <hi>Dunbar,</hi> to diſpoſe of priſoners, and to order other matters as the occaſion requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. And the priſoners being ſo nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, that it ſeemed to be as much trouble to retain them as it was to take them, the Lord General diſcharged neer upon 5000 of them (moſt ſick and wounded) the reſt (much about the ſame number) being conveyed to <hi>Berwick</hi> by four Troops of Colonel <hi>Hacker</hi>'s Horſe.</p>
               <p>Having given this account of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptives, a word or two of thoſe that eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by flight. Their General it ſeems was
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:54215:69"/>
one of that number, and none of thoſe that made the leaſt haſte neither, or elſe he could not have been at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> by ten of the clock that morning whereon the Battel was fought; outſtripping his Lieutenant-General, who got not thither till the afternoon. But if they had made leſs haſte, they might have come before they had been welcom, unleſs they had brought better news; the Gariſon and inhabitants being very much dampt at their report, as alſo thoſe of <hi>Leith;</hi> inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that <hi>Edinburgh</hi> was preſently quit by its Gariſon, and <hi>Leith</hi> reſolved to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Victors, not knowing how to keep them out. But though the Engliſh had thus poſſeſſed the Town of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> the Caſtle remained untoucht; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eſteemed impregnable, and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Town, the Scots hoped that the Engliſh would ſoon finde their new quarters too hot to hold them; and ſo much the rather, for that the ſaid Caſtle (beſides its natural ſtrength) was well manned, had a conſiderable Artillery on the walls, and ſtore of all ſorts of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; Colonel <hi>William Dundaſs</hi> being its Governour. However, the ſame day the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:54215:70"/>
Scots deſerted the Town, the Engliſh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Lambert</hi> took poſſeſſion of the ſame, as alſo of <hi>Leith;</hi> in both which places they found ſeveral Pieces of Ordnance, many Arms, and conſiderable proviſions; which were too heavie for the Scots to take with them, becauſe of their haſte. But how well the new Gariſon of <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> agreed with their neighbours in the Caſtle, we ſhall hear afterwards.</p>
               <p>Upon this, the Lord General coming up with the remainder of the Army, the Scots were in deſpair of neſtling there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; and therefore made <hi>Sterling</hi> their next refuge; whither reſorted thoſe that had eſcaped at <hi>Dunbar,</hi> to help to piece up their ſhattered Army, that ſo in a ſecond Encounter they might endeavour to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their loſt credit. To this purpoſe alſo recruits were raiſed by the Committee of Eſtates in all places under their power: their Officers are likewiſe new molded, new ones being taken in, and old ones laid aſide, according as they ſaw occaſion: this change being not in inferiour Officers on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but among the great Commanders likewiſe: for old <hi>Leven</hi> was laid aſide, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit <hi>David Leſley</hi> were continued.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:54215:70"/>
But this their rallying and recruiting, chopping and changing, ſignified little: for (as if they had been poſteſt with a like ſpirit with thoſe infatuated Jews in <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> when that City was cloſely begirt by the Romanes) notwithſtanding that the Engliſh had given them that ſore blow at <hi>Dunbar,</hi> driven them from their Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis, and were ſtill improving thoſe advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages; the Scots, in ſtead of joyning heart and hand in defending their Country a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſo prevailing an adverſary, ſplit themſelves into ſo many fractions and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, that it would require ſome curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to diſcriminate them. The moſt notable were theſe: <hi>Straughan</hi> and <hi>Car</hi> in the Weſt, who declared againſt the Kings par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and were called <hi>Remonſtrators:</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther party were for King and Kirk, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid Leſley,</hi> Major Gen. <hi>Holborn,</hi> and thoſe in <hi>Fife:</hi> and a third ſort were purely for the King; theſe with <hi>Middleton</hi> keep the High-lands.</p>
               <p>This Kingdom being thus divided, was not likely long to ſtand. For animoſities growing higher and higher among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, little care was taken to repreſs the Engliſh, who ranged at pleaſure about the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:54215:71"/>
Country. And the Lord General having his Head-quarters at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving what courſe the Scots ſteered, lay not idle; but having refreſhed his men, <hi>Sept.</hi> 14. he drew out the greateſt part of his Army for <hi>Sterling,</hi> and faced the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, having at firſt ſome thoughts to ſtorm it; but finding that the Horſe could not well ſecond the Foot, he deſiſted for that time, and returned back to the Head-quarters. Whither being come, order is given for carrying all the Boats in the <hi>Frith</hi> to <hi>Leith,</hi> for prevention of the Scots Ferrying over into <hi>Fyfe,</hi> to joyn with the Enemy there.</p>
               <p>And ſince (according to the Proverb) <hi>of Idleneſs comes no goodneſs;</hi> therefore, to keep his men in action, and that they may the better acquaint themſelves with the Country, the Lord General (his work go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on well before <hi>Edinburgh-</hi>Caſtle, of which a particular account ſhall be given in its place) marcht away ſix Regiments of Foot, and nine of Horſe and Dragoons, for <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> a City of a pleaſant ſite, upon a River navigable for ſmall Boats, which uſually bring up proviſions from <hi>Patricks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town,</hi> ten miles thence, where ſhips of
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:54215:71"/>
good burden may ride. In <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> the ſtreets and houſes are more neat and clean then thoſe of <hi>Edinburgh;</hi> it being alſo one of the chiefeſt Univerſities in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the way of <hi>Linlithgow,</hi> the Lord General ſent a Paper to the Committee of Eſtates, to try once more what might be done by fair means: a copie whereof was likewiſe at the ſame time diſpatched away to Colonel <hi>Car</hi> and <hi>Straughan,</hi> to the ſame end.</p>
               <p>Little elſe was remarkable in this Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, then the taking of a ſmall Cariſon neer <hi>Kelſith,</hi> a place famous for being the Stage whereon ſomtime the valiant <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſs</hi> had acted ſuch great things, as even ſhook the foundations of the Kirk; and had ſubverted it, if the Engliſh had not in time ſtretched out their hand to ſupport the ſame. This heroick Champion, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he wrought ſuch great things with ſmall Forces, (ever encountring con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Armies with a handful, ſo that not one of his men could be exempted from continual duty) yet could not avoid the frowns of adverſe fortune; wherein nevertheleſs, although his body were ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptivated,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:54215:72"/>
his ſpirit remained free, bearing up above the higheſt affronts of his enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged enemies, who loaded him with all the ignominy that Malice it ſelf could invent; firſt inflicting on him a moſt reproachful death; and next, mangling his dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, the quarters whereof they cauſed to be hung up in ſeveral places, for publike view. On the Tolbooth at <hi>Glaſgow</hi> hung one of his legs, which the Engliſh (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring what he was) took down and buried privately.</p>
               <p>Now the Lord General retires to <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> the ſeaſon admitting of no conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable action, but onely what neceſſity required. And a neceſſary work they went about, in ſuppreſſing a company of ſturdy knaves called Moſs-Troopers, who daily plaid their pranks with great bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and (by the treachery and conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence of the Country-people) murdered many of the Engliſh Souldiers, eſpecially ſtraglers: nay, their confidence grew ſo high, as to ſteal ſome of the Train-horſes belonging to the Army. To that end, a Proclamation was publiſhed by the Lord General, to this effect:
<q>
                     <pb n="137" facs="tcp:54215:72"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>THat finding many of the Army were not onely ſpoiled and robbed, but alſo others barbarouſly butchered and ſlain, by a ſort of Outlaws, not under the diſcipline of any Army; and finding that all tenderneſs to the Country produced no other effect, then their compliance with, and protection of ſuch perſons: therefore conſidering that it is in the Countries power to detect and diſcover them; and perceiving their motion to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, by their invitation and intelligence of Country-people; therefore he declared, That where-ever theſe enormities ſhould be committed for the future, life ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired for life, and a plenary ſatisfaction for the goods thus ſtollen, of thoſe Pariſhes and places where the fact ſhould be committed, unleſs they did diſcover and produce the offender.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Preſently after the publiſhing of this Proclamation, Colonel <hi>Monk</hi> with a commanded party of Foot, four Pieces of Ordnance, and a Mortar-piece, was ſent to hunt theſe Beaſts of prey. And upon information that <hi>Derlton-</hi>Houſe near <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dington</hi> was one of their Neſts, <hi>Monk</hi>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:54215:73"/>
and <hi>Lambert</hi> bent their Force towards it; and approaching it an evening, by the next day they had planted their Battery, whence they plyed the Houſe with great Guns, the Mortar-piece alſo being not unoccupied: but all wrought little effect, till at laſt one of the Granadoes falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the houſe, broke the Iron bar of the inner gate, and forced it open, throwing the Draw-bridge into the Moat; it alſo killed the Moſs-Troopers Lieutenant. This rough handling made them cry out for Quarter, profering to quit the Houſe, ſo they might ſave their lives. But theſe beggers not being admitted to be chuſers, at laſt ſubmit to mercy. Their number was thirty, and their Captain one <hi>Waite,</hi> who (with two others of the moſt deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate of them) was preſently ſhot to death, and the reſt made priſoners.</p>
               <p>This place being thus reduced, <hi>Monk</hi> takes with him 600 Foot for <hi>Roſlane</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle; where at firſt he found oppoſition, but upon ſecond thoughts it was yeelded to mercy.</p>
               <p>From theſe leſs conſiderable atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the Engliſh proceed to greater. For the heat of their courage made them
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:54215:73"/>
inſenſible (as it were) of the coldneſs of the weather; ſo that in ſtead of lurking in Winter-quarters, (as is uſual in ſuch a ſeaſon, in warmer climates too) they ſtir abroad to finde out the Enemy. And now they draw near to that grand party in the Weſt of <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſometimes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by <hi>Car</hi> and <hi>Straughan,</hi> who had withdrawn themſelves from the obedience of King, Kirk and State, publiſhing a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration containing the Reaſons of their ſo doing; which was to this purpoſe:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>THat that which is obvious in the firſt place among the ſins of the Land, is the late proceedings with the King: That they would diſtinguiſh betwixt their duty and their ſin: their duty was to uſe all lawful ways for reclaiming the King, and to own his intereſt accordingly as he owned and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted the Cauſe: that it was their ſin, and the ſin of the Kingdom, that the King had walked in the ways of his fathers oppoſition to the work of Reformation; and yet that they ſhould receive him, notwithſtanding his peace made with the Iriſh, the Commiſſion given to</hi> James Graham (meaning <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſs) for invaſion of</hi> Scotland; <hi>and after
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:54215:74"/>
all this, to aſſure him by Commiſſioners the exerciſe of Royal power, upon his bare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion to joyn in the Cauſe and Covenant, without any further proof of his repentance, or convincing evidences of the reality of his profeſſions. That the Treaty was continued with him, after his dealing was diſcovered in the actual invaſion of the Kingdom. That the King himſelf did ſtill continue the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant party in the Kingdom, cleaving to them, and following their counſels: and this not done onely in the Kingdom of</hi> Scotland, <hi>but alſo abroad, by keeping correſpondence with the Lord of</hi> Ormond <hi>and the Earl of</hi> Newcaſtle. <hi>That he refuſed to ſigne the Declaration offered to him by the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee of Eſtates and General Aſſembly, until it was extorted from him, and he of neceſſity enforced to take it. That he ſtill purſued the ſame deſignes ſince the Treaty as before, endeavouring to have the Malignants of the Kingdom in power and trust, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in his frequent converſing and corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence with them, notwithſtanding they were diſcharged the Court by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. By theſe things it is manifest, that the King hath not proſecuted the Cauſe of God, but rather in oppoſition to the work
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:54215:74"/>
of God and the Covenant. They therefore according to the Declaration of Kirk and State the 13 of</hi> Auguſt 1650. <hi>diſclaim all the ſin and guilt of the King and his houſe, both old and new, and declare that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not own him nor his intereſt in the ſtate of the quarrel betwixt him and the enemy againſt whom they were to hazard their lives.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Remonſtrance was ſent to the Committee of Eſtates then at <hi>Sterling,</hi> the 25 of <hi>November</hi> 1650. where it bred great diviſions and diſſentings amongſt them. Much debate there was, what to do in it: to approve thereof, would adde many more fractions to their already-bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken State, and make all deſperate: to ſhew an utter diſlike of it, would put the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrators upon ſecuring themſelves, leſt if they ſhould fall under the laſh of their own Eſtates, they might be worſe handled then by being in the power of the Engliſh. But at laſt they agreed upon a Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which was drawn up, and voted to be ſent to the Commiſſioners of the Kirk; wherein they declared,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the ſaid Remonſtrance, as it rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:54215:75"/>
to the Parliament and Civil Judicato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, was ſcandalous and injurious to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Perſon, and injurious to his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: and that it held out ſeeds of diviſion, and was of a dangerous conſequence, and withal diſhonourable to the Kingdom, in ſo far as it tended to a breach of the Treaty with the Kings Majeſtie at</hi> Breda, <hi>appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Parliament and General Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly: that it ſtrengthened the hand of the Enemy, giving him wherewithal to juſtifie his unjuſt invaſion; and weakned the hands of many honeſt men. Laſtly, that through the ſubtil contrivance thereof, many religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Gentlemen, Officers and Miniſters have been thereby enſnared.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was backt by the Aſſembly of the Kirk, who ſignified their concurrence with the Eſtates in diſlike of the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance; but ſo nevertheleſs, as (if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) to bring <hi>Car</hi> and his party over by fair means: to which end, many Papers paſs'd betwixt them, and all means were uſed to compoſe differences.</p>
               <p>The Engliſh Lord General obſerving theſe Weſtern diſſenters to agree with him in many particulars, ſent them ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:54215:75"/>
invitations to come in to him. Who (being proud of ſo many courtings from all ſides) grew ſo high thereupon, as to think themſelves ſtrong enough to defend their own Cauſe againſt all oppoſers. But as if Diviſions had not already ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently torn that Nation, this Party, who had lately made ſo great a rent therein, ſoon after ſubdivide themſelves; <hi>Strau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghan</hi> withdrawing himſelf, and in a ſmall time cloſing with the Engliſh. So that <hi>Car</hi> commands all now himſelf; and how he behaved himſelf in his command, we ſhall preſently ſee.</p>
               <p>Upon this Party the Engliſh Lord Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral had a ſpecial eye, they quartering near; who if they could not be made friends, might prove dangerous enemies, and bad neighbours. At laſt, after many fruitleſs endeavours uſed to draw them over to him, he reſolves (notwithſtanding the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of marching at that time of the year, it being <hi>December)</hi> to force them to it, or to do worſe. Which was ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly effected, in a ſhort time after. For a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the end of <hi>November,</hi> Major-Gen. <hi>Lambert,</hi> and Commiſſary-Gen. <hi>Whalley,</hi> with five Regiments of Horſe, were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:54215:76"/>
by the General to march from <hi>Pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles</hi> to <hi>Hamilton,</hi> on the South-ſide of <hi>Cloid;</hi> himſelf in the mean time march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from <hi>Edinburgh</hi> on the North-ſide, where he tarried the greateſt part of a day: but having good intelligence where <hi>Lambert</hi> and his party were, and the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being very bad, he returned back. Whereof when Colonel <hi>Car</hi> had notice, as alſo that <hi>Lambert</hi> had taken up his quarters at <hi>Hamilton,</hi> he conceived that now a fit opportunity was offered him of making ſure work with him, he being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned from the Body of the Army, and ſupinely ſleeping (as he dreamed) without any thoughts of an enemy. With this confident perſwaſion, <hi>Car</hi> ſets upon a ſudden March in the night, with about 1500 Horſe; and before day (making more haſte then good ſpeed) he furiouſly breaks into <hi>Lambert</hi>'s Quarters; and finding no oppoſition at his firſt entry, he was emboldened to go up to the middle of the Town; where a Captain with about 40 ſouldiers having taken the Alarm, had ſuddenly mounted: theſe (being favoured by a tree that lay croſs the ſtreet) gave a check to their carreer, till the whole
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:54215:76"/>
Gariſon was alarm'd. The ſuddenneſs of the buſineſs did ſomewhat amaze the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh: but having ſoon recollected them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they reſume their wonted courage, being alſo very much animated by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of their Officers forwardneſs. And to make their work the more perfect, part of their Forces being left in the Town, to engage the Enemy, and to ſecure the Rere, the reſidue drew out, that if poſſible they might ſurround the Enemies whole party; who making a timely diſcovery of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, very cunningly fac'd about and fled. Though this encounter laſted not long, yet of the Scots were ſlain near upon 100, and as many taken priſoners; ſome few of whom might well be accounted many, conſidering their quality: for among them was <hi>Car</hi> himſelf, his Lieutenant-Colonel, and Captain-Lieutenant.</p>
               <p>This Victory was not ſo well won, but it was as well followed; for the chaſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued as far as <hi>Ayre;</hi> where alſo were routed a party of 150, which was the chief remains of the Remonſtrators. This Succeſs came very ſeaſonably; and the more conſiderable it was, by how much the more difficult it would have been to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:54215:77"/>
them againſt their will: for they knowing the Country well, and having the people on their ſide, could march a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout at pleaſure; when the Engliſh durſt not follow without a great part of their Army for fear of <hi>Leſley,</hi> who then lay at <hi>Sterling</hi> with the Scotch Army, ready to make uſe of all advantages that might ſerve for his purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Immediately upon this, followed the Rendition of <hi>Edinburgh-</hi>Caſtle (the moſt conſiderable ſtrong hold in all <hi>Scotland:)</hi> It is ſeated upon a very high Precipice, over-looking and commanding all places about it; inſomuch that many times the Engliſh Souldiers in their Quarters were galled with the Shot ſent from the great Guns into <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the Lord General came firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, which was immediately after the Rout at <hi>Dunbar,</hi> he ſent in a Summons to the Governour Colonel <hi>Will. Dundaſs;</hi> which wrought no effect: preſently after, ſeveral Papers were ſent in to invite the Miniſters to come forth to their ſeveral charges; but they refuſing ſo civil an offer, the Lord General then ſeriouſly conſidered with his chief Officers which
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:54215:77"/>
way to reduce by force both them and it: knowing, that if it ſhould continue thus in the Scots hands, his own work would be very much retarded thereby. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, the place being viewed, nothing could be ſeen to encourage the attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pting of it by ſtorm. But as there is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more ways then one to win; ſo every one of theſe ways that carryed probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with it, was debated. At laſt, a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was taken, That ſeeing this impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable place could not be beaten down, endeavours ſhould be uſed to blow it up: to that end, Miners both Scotch and Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, were ſent for, to carry on the work: In order to this reſolution, about the end of <hi>September,</hi> the Galleries were begun in the night; which was no ſooner per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by thoſe in the Caſtle, but they ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry angerly fired upon it with five great Guns, and ſeveral vollies of ſmall Shot; which nothing hindered the Engliſh, whoſe indefatigable pains wrought through the earth, until at laſt coming to the main rock, it put them to a ſtand, finding it not to be of that mould they imagined. Yet could not this diſmay thoſe, whoſe reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions far ſurmounting the difficulty of
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:54215:78"/>
their preſent deſign; for finding the mattock did not perform its part, they, by other means, made holes in the ſtones; and filling them full of Powder, made them fly by firing.</p>
               <p>But the Lord General taking notice how tedious the mining work went on, and withal conſidering the uncertainty of the wiſhed event when finiſhed; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to make a quick diſpatch, he gave order for raiſing a Mount not far from the Caſtle upon a riſing ground, whereon to plant a Battery, that ſo the Enterpriſe might be carryed on above ground as well as beneath. The ſight of this, very much amazed <hi>Dundaſs</hi> the Governour, who now perceived what a vanity it was to withſtand the Engliſh induſtry. Yet to quit himſelf of that great truſt repoſed in him by his ſuperiours, and withal to che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh the hopes of his Country-men, whoſe eyes were generally upon him, he did the utmoſt to anſwer the expectations of thoſe that thought this bone might go near to break <hi>Cromwels</hi> teeth: who here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in were much deceived; for it could do no more then whet his appetite, and make him long for the poſſeſſion of this
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:54215:78"/>
ſtrong Fort; ſince the greater the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition be, the more is a great ſpirit raiſed thereby.</p>
               <p>The Battery being now raiſed to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient height (in ſpite of all impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) by the unwearied labours of the Souldiers, and all things neceſſary prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, four Mortar-Pieces and ſix battering Guns were drawn from <hi>Leith,</hi> and quickly mounted againſt the Caſtle. Now the word of command was onely wanting, which the Lord General deferred to give, until he had ſent to the Governour once more, willing him to yeild by fair means, and ſave the labour of being inforc'd by foul. The Summons was ſent the 11 of <hi>December,</hi> and ſpake thus;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That he being reſolued by Gods aſſiſtance to uſe ſuch means as were put into his hands for to reduce the Caſtle, did, for the preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of farther miſery, demand the rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the place to him upon fit conditions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Governour having received the ſame, made anſwer,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That he was intruſted by the Committee of the Eſtates of</hi> Scotland <hi>for the keeping of the Caſtle: and that he could not deliver it up without leave from them; and therefore
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:54215:79"/>
deſired ten days time to ſend to them, and receive their anſwer: upon receipt whereof the General ſhould receive his reſolute an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Lord General knowing delays to be dangerous, and that time was preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and not to be loſt in vain, he makes this ſuddain reply:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That it concerned not him to know the Obligations of them that truſted him; but that he might have honourable terms for himſelf, and thoſe that were with him: but that he could not give liberty to him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult with the Committee of Estates, becauſe he heard thoſe among them that were honest enjoyed not ſatisfaction, and the reſt were now diſcovered to ſeek another intereſt then they had formerly pretended to; in which if he deſired to be ſatisfied, he might have information at a neerer diſtance then</hi> St. Johnſtons.</p>
               <p>This Parley was intended to continue until 10 in the morning, <hi>Decemb.</hi> 13. but there flying from the Caſtle ſome great Shot on the over-night, the next morning order was given to try the Mortar-Pieces: which was done; three with ſhells, and the fourth with ſtones. This produced
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:54215:79"/>
the Governours Anſwer to the Lord Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals laſt Meſſage; wherein <hi>he adjured him in the Fear and Name of the living God, (which was called upon in the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of his great trust) that liberty might be granted for him to ſend to the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee of Eſtates, and that he ſhould be very willing to receive information from thoſe of his Country-men whom he could truſt.</hi> The Lord Generals reply was, <hi>That whoſoever he would appoint to come to him, ſhould have liberty for one hour; but to ſend to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of Eſtates, he could not grant.</hi> To this the Governour was ſilent, until the Mortar-Pieces and great Guns began to play againſt the Caſtle; which they did for ſome ſmall time, with great violence. This made <hi>Dundaſs</hi> ſend forth a Drum to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire a Conference with the Proveſt of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berdeen,</hi> and one more then in <hi>Edinburgh:</hi> which the Lord General willingly conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended unto. But they ſeeing it to be a buſineſs of great concernment, utterly refuſed to have any thing to do with it; leaving the Governour to take his own courſe in the buſineſs. The Drummer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing returned with this anſwer into the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, it much perplext the Governour, who
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:54215:80"/>
reflecting on the ſad condition he was in, ſaw himſelf ſurrounded with many dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers both from abroad and within: for ſhould he yeild, it would go near to coſt him his life, if ever he went to give an account to thoſe that intruſted him with this charge: for the loſs of ſo ſtrong a place would exaſperate them beyond reaſon, and fill their minds ſo full of anger and revenge, that in vain he might go about to make his own defence. Should he ſtand it out, and defend the Caſtle, haply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief might come, and ſo he might preſerve his honour, and raiſe his reputation to a high pitch; which are things a valiant Souldier ought to be as careful of, as life it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Theſe Conſiderations at laſt made him wave all other thoughts, and wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to acquit himſelf manfully, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own ſtrength, and that the Nation could not afford a better Gariſon to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain then this, being naturally ſtrong and unacceſſible. No ſooner had he reſolved thus with himſelf, but his mind was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly ſignified to the Engliſh by a fair red Enſigne hung out in defiance on the top of the Caſtle, and the roaring of great
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:54215:80"/>
Guns from the Battlements of the wall. This Muſick was no ways unpleaſant in the Lord Generals ears; who anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the Scotch red Flag, produced Red-Coats (a ſight more formidable) and for their Guns, ſent them in ſuch Balls, that the ſtrongeſt Arm in the Caſtle could not beat back again. For now he thought it concerned him to let them know his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt force, ſeeing they were ſo hardy as to withſtand his power three moneths, when a potent Army at <hi>Dunbar</hi> could not do it three hours. Therefore <hi>December</hi> 17 the great Guns play hard on the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, and the Granadoes flying in the Ayr, were as ſo many prodigious Comets threatning miſery to the Beſieged, who in defence of themſelves made the Caſtle ſeem <hi>Aetna,</hi> perpetually vomiting out ſmoak and fire; but all to little purpoſe: for the Lord General ſhowred ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſtorms of ſhot upon them, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven made them deſpair of withſtanding the ſame.</p>
               <p>The Governour ſeeing this, and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that now he had done ſufficient for one man, beat a Parley, offering to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render, if (ſtill harping on this ſtring)
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:54215:81"/>
leave might be granted to ſend to the Committee of Eſtates, and ſee if their leaſure would permit them to come with relief. But this being ſtill denyed, Col. <hi>Dundaſs</hi> and his Souldiers thought it not good to abide any more of theſe fiery tryals, and therefore agreed to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all up, on theſe Articles:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the Caſtle of</hi> Edinburgh, <hi>the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, Arms, Ammunition, Magazines, and Furniture of War, ſhould be delivered up to the Lord General</hi> Cromwel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the Scots ſhould have the liberty to carry away their publick Regiſters, publick Moveables, private Evidences and Writs, into</hi> Fife <hi>or</hi> Sterling.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That thoſe Goods in the Caſtle belonging to any perſon whatſoever, the Owners ſhould have them reſtored again: this to be proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that all might take notice of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the Governour, and all Military Officers and Souldiers, might depart without moleſtation, carrying their Arms and Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, with Drums beating, and Colours fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to</hi> Brunt-Iſland <hi>in</hi> Fife: <hi>moreover, the ſick and wounded Souldiers to ſtay in</hi> Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh <hi>till cured, and then to receive the ſame benefit of Articles with the reſt of their Fellows.</hi>
               </p>

According to theſe Articles this ſtrong Caſtle being delivered up, <hi>December</hi> 24. was preſently poſſeſt by ſome Companies of the Engliſh, who found therein (to their admiration) 53 Peeces of Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, 15 of them Iron, the reſt Braſs; 8000 Arms, 80 Barrels of Powder, and all things elſe ſuitable. The Articles were punctually performed, by the very great care of the Lord General, who ſent forth a Proclamation (according to the Tenour of the Agreement) for all perſons to come freely to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and fetch what Goods belonged to them; promiſing that they ſhould not receive the leaſt wrong, nor be injured nor moleſted in their Egreſs or Regreſs; the Souldiers on pain of death being commanded to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the Proclamation: and that none might plead ignorance, it was proclaimed by beat of Drum, and ſound of Trumpet in <hi>Edinburgh</hi> and <hi>Leith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of ſuch importance was this place to the Engliſh, that it might compare with any of their Succeſſes ever ſince they firſt footed Scotch Ground: <hi>Dunbar-</hi>Victory was a great advantage, and the routing of <hi>Car</hi> conduced much to the weakning of the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:54215:82"/>
Enemy; but theſe things onely pared the nailes of <hi>Kirk</hi> and <hi>States,</hi> which would after a while grow again; or elſe broke their ſhins, and made them halt a little, which might be quickly cured by a Plaiſter brought out of the <hi>Highlands:</hi> but this loſs of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> Caſtle is irrecoverable; no more ſuch ſtrong places will grow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; the loſs of which almoſt broke the Scots hearts, and made them cry out, That <hi>Cromwel</hi> fought with more then ordinary Engines, and ſhot better Metal then Lead, or elſe it had been impoſſible to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce that which in imagination was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted impregnable. But this was meer fancie: for ſeldome it is, that any ſide lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, but ſome will maintain it was by Treachery; when there was no ſuch thing: ſo was it here: for <hi>Dundaſs</hi> the Governour did what lay in his power, and bore up couragiouſly, notwithſtanding he was bereft of half himſelf; for his wife was ſlain by a Granado that broak into the Caſtle; and his Souldiers were ſo frighted, being frequently wounded by them, that at laſt laying by the duty of Souldiers, they commanded their Commander, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forc'd him to do what he did. But theſe
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:54215:82"/>
unruly fellows being conveyed (according to Articles) into <hi>Fift,</hi> found to their coſt that they had leaped out of the frying-Pan into the Fire: for about ſeventy of them were clapt up to anſwer for their miſdemeanours. Where they lay ſome time, until the Kirk and States were at leaſure to call them to an account.</p>
               <p>The crowning of their King was now the main buſineſs in agitation amongſt them: this had been delayed long by the Kirk and States, who gave him ſome time to repent of all his Fathers ſins, and his own tranſgreſſions; which he at firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing, it had like to have ſet him beſides the ſaddle: this backwardneſs in him, made the Kirk afraid to truſt in his hands the reins of Government; wherefore they ſet themſelves wholly to teach him mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, and rules of the new Creature; withal making him underſtand how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible it was to obtain a Crown, except he took up the Croſs and followed them.</p>
               <p>But the Engliſh vigorous proſecution of their deſignes, quickned them forward to expedite this buſineſs, which they of themſelves were backward enough in. A head they ſaw was requiſite to compoſe
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:54215:83"/>
that enmity which was among them, and bring in thoſe families in the <hi>Highlands</hi> (that declared purely for Royalty) to joyn with them in repelling the Preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the <hi>Common Enemy,</hi> (which was the term beſtowed on the Engliſh Army:) for now it was declared lawful to make uſe of all perſons that became Souldiers, at this time of need; contrary to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrators opinion, who would not admit of any to ſerve in the Army, but ſuch as could give ſufficient teſtimony of their godly lives and converſations: ſo that in their judgments none were to be made choice of, (let the caſe of neceſſity be never ſo urgent) unleſs they could overcome by the Spirit: if a houſe be on fire, nay more, a kingdom, no water muſt be made uſe of, but that which is clean; rather ſhould it burn down, then one drop of foul be caſt into it. Theſe Conceits in <hi>Scotland</hi> made ſuch a fracture amongſt the Clergie of that Nation, as to this day could never be cured again. But to return whence we digreſſed.</p>
               <p>The firſt of <hi>January</hi> was appointed to be the day whereon the King ſhould be crowned: great preparations were made to inveſt him in his Royal Power at <hi>Scone:</hi>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:54215:83"/>
it was performed with the greateſt Pomp and Magnificence that the preſent condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Nation could afford: the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility attending in their Robes; and the Marqueſs of <hi>Argile,</hi> as Speaker from the Parliament, made a Speech: he having ended, the Miniſters began with an Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation how to uſe that which they were going to put in his power: then the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant being tendered to him, was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſubſcribed. <hi>Argile</hi> ſetting the Crown upon his head, (which was too heavy for one to bear) the people ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed great demonſtrations of Joy, by their chearful acclamations of <hi>God ſave King</hi> Charles <hi>the ſecond.</hi> This News was quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpread through all the Gariſons in <hi>Fife,</hi> where was ſeen the like content, ſignified by the thundering report of great Guns, and lighting of Bon-fires.</p>
               <p>This ſolemnity being over, the main de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne now was to raiſe ſuch an Army as might not onely ſecure what they had ſtill in poſſeſſion, but drive the Engliſh quite out of thoſe places lately loſt: to bring this to paſs, Commiſſions were granted for raiſing Horſe and Foot, and new Commanders brought in. <hi>Middleton<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

he was made Lieutenant-General of the Horſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lord General all this while was no idle Spectator, but took ſuch notice of theſe paſſages, as might enable him to make his own uſe of them, and let them know, that greater Forces then they were able to raiſe, could not make him loſe his hold, nor inforce one foot of ground from him. Therefore to make ſure work, and get into his hands all thoſe Gariſons of the Scots which were on the South-ſide the <hi>Frith,</hi> he commanded Colonel <hi>Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi> with his own Regiment, and Colonel <hi>Sylers</hi> to reduce <hi>Hume</hi> Caſtle, and bring it under obedience. The Governours name thereof was <hi>Cockburn,</hi> a man much governed by fancie, as you will ſee. <hi>Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi> no ſooner received this Order, but immediately he applyed himſelf to the work; and having drawn his men up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, ſent a Summons to the Governour in theſe words:</p>

               <p>Here may be perceived how ignorant the Governour was of <hi>Cromwels</hi> Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Which ignorance of his muſt needs be either pretended, or wilful: for it could not be that he ſhould know no more, when the whole world had heard ſo much: but 'tis probable he thought a part of his Army which wanted his preſence, had not the ſame faculty in conquering, that he himſelf had when in perſon; and therefore took the boldneſs after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of his Anſwer, to ſalute Colonel <hi>Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi> with theſe Verſes:
<q>
                     <l>I <hi>William</hi> of the Waſtle</l>

               <p>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:54215:85"/>
This is <hi>Mars</hi> mixt with a Tincture of <hi>Mercury.</hi> If the Superfluity of his Pen had been able to rout two Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, what might his Sword have done? But Colonel <hi>Fenwick</hi> having placed a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery againſt the Caſtle, returns him He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick Verſe for his reſolute Rhymes: for the great Guns (being one Mortar-piece and a Culvering) quickly made the feathers fly, eſpecially a Granado that fell in the middle of the Caſtle, which did them great miſchief. But yet they held out, until a ſmall breach being opened, and the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh ready to enter, the Governour beat a Parley. But <hi>Fenwick</hi> now was reſolved to hearken to no Compoſition but onely quarter for life: which was accepted of; ſo the Governour, with his Gariſon, (78 Commanders and private Souldiers) gang'd forth of the Caſtle; which was preſently poſſeſt by Captain <hi>Collinſon</hi> with his Company.</p>
               <p>It had been long now ſince the Lord General himſelf had been in the field; for though Action was that which chiefly correſponded to his Nature, yet the ſharpneſs of the ſeaſon made him conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in his Winter-quarters for ſome ſmall
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:54215:86"/>
time longer: in which time, parties were, ſent abroad to enlarge their Quarters, and clear the paſſage between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Edinburgh. Timptallon-</hi>Caſtle was a place which many times had cut off paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, and much moleſted the Country by frequent excurſions: for the reducing of which, Colonel <hi>Monk</hi> (that gallant Commander) was ſent with about three Regiments of Horſe and Foot. When firſt he came before it, finding the Scots very refractory, he cauſed the Mortar-pieces to play for 48 hours: which did them little hurt; until that ſix battering Guns being planted, they played their parts ſo well, that the Governour was enforſt to yeild (ſeeing no other conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons would be granted) to Mercy, and all thoſe that were with him.</p>
               <p>The Scots King having now got ſome power into his hands, uſed his utmoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to gain reputation amongſt his Subjects, by viſiting all the Gariſons in <hi>Fife,</hi> and putting them in a poſture to hinder the Engliſh from landing on that ſide the <hi>Frith;</hi> But having experience of the Lord Generals courage, and knowing that Forts would prove weak withſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:54215:86"/>
of his Forces, ſhould they make an attempt; therefore he drew from <hi>Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> thoſe Horſe and Foot which could be well ſpared, and joyning with them the new-raiſed ſouldiers, he quartered them all along the VVater-ſide, for better ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>After this buſineſs was ended, away rides he to the High-lands, to compoſe differences, (for that place was not free from diſſentions) &amp; perſwade thoſe rough-hewn Fellows to riſe unanimouſly in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of their craggy habitations.</p>
               <p>This progreſs vvas no ſooner ended, but the ſitting of the Scotch Parliament at <hi>St. Johnſtons</hi> vvas begun, vvhere the chief conſideration vvas ſtill to recruit their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my vvith new ſupplies of men. This Meeting produced an <hi>Act, Ordinance,</hi> or <hi>great Gun,</hi> to terrifie thoſe that ſhould ſlip away from their Colours vvithout leave from their Captains, and vvas fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by the Clergie (to ſhew how rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy they were to promote theſe deſignes) with an exhortatory Declaration, ſtufft with raiſing rhetorick againſt the Engliſh, which was ſent into <hi>Fife</hi> and the High-lands, perſwading all to riſe at this time of
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:54215:87"/>
need. This produced little: for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people muſt not ſtir, unleſs their <hi>Lords</hi> or <hi>Leards</hi> beat the Drum. But theſe Grandees were now buſily ſnarling one at another about ſuperiority in the Army; every one endeavoring to be in the chiefeſt place of command: and if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one were advanced, he that came next behind pulled him by the skirts, to hinder his preferment. By this means the Scots great undertakings went on but ſlowly.</p>
               <p>But to return, and make an inſpection into the Engliſh Affairs: We find the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in and about <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> under a cloud of ſorrow, mourning for the Eclipſe of that great Luminary which erſt while had ſhined ſo bright in their Hemiſphere, whoſe influence had many times melted the waxen Whings of his ambitious Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; but now (as all men are ſubject to be ſo) this great General by ſickneſs was confined to his Chamber, and utterly diſ-abled for the preſent to act in perſon with the Army, ſhould any new occaſion call them forth of their Winter-Quarters.</p>
               <p>This did not ſo much depreſs the ſpirits of the Engliſh Souldiery, (who were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:54215:87"/>
ſenſible of their unſpeakable loſs, ſhould. <hi>Cromwel</hi> their fortunate Leader be now ſnach't away from them in the midſt of their hopes) as it heightned the Scots, who were very much elevated with the fancy of his death; believing the ſligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt report of it to be real truths, becauſe it correſponded with their deſires; ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining to themſelves aſſurance of Victory and ſufficient Revenge, when death had conquered him, who many times before had made them feel the force of his Steel. This conceit was ſo deeply grounded in their imaginations, that no report to the contrary could ſupplant it, but it muſt be ſo, becauſe ſo they would have it: ſo apt are men to believe any thing that ſerves for their purpoſe, according to that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Quod volumus, facile credimus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this <hi>Chimaera</hi> ſoon vaniſhed into nothing: for a Scotch Trumpeter being ſent out of <hi>Fife</hi> to <hi>Edinburgh</hi> about the reſtoration of a Ship laden with Goods which the Engliſh Frigats had taken ſailing from <hi>Brunt-Iſland</hi> to <hi>Fife;</hi> after his meſſage was delivered, he very confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently aver'd to the Souldiers, That their General was dead, and that they did well
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:54215:88"/>
in hiding it; but all the world ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver make him believe otherwiſe. This report was much wondered at; and the more, becauſe the Reporter did it with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of confidence, endeavouring to perſwade all to chirp after his note. But he could not long perſiſt in his opinion; for this Novelty being handed about from one to another, at laſt it came to the Lord Generals ear, who much admired ſuch a thing ſhould be, and he not know it: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to diſpoſſeſs the Trumpeter of that conceit, he cauſed him to be brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his preſence; where coming, he now ſaw, that although ſickneſs had for ſome time ſorely handled this noble General, yet now his recovery was ſo far advanced, and that Nature had now gotten ſo much maſtery over his diſtemper, that in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability he would walk forth in a ſmall time to take the air, and viſit his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours at <hi>Sterling,</hi> if not in <hi>Fife.</hi> At the return of the Trumpeter to thoſe that ſent him, he quickly blew away this falſe report which went ſo currantly in the Scotch Army, and aſſured the falſity of it.</p>
               <p>The Parliament in <hi>England</hi> having e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:54215:88"/>
a watchful eye on the Affairs in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> with ſingular providence provided ſufficient ſupplies both of Men, Money and Proviſions of all ſorts for Horſe and Man, diſpatching them away continually to the Army; ſo that it might be ſaid, That <hi>never was an Army better provided for, then this; nor ever did Souldiers better de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve encouragement then theſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About this time arrived at <hi>Leith</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral <hi>Dean,</hi> one of the Engliſh Generals at Sea, with large ſupplies from <hi>London:</hi> amongſt other conveniences, he brought 27 great flat-bottom'd Boats, which were for tranſportation of the Army over into <hi>Fife,</hi> that ſo thereby a quick diſpatch might be made of this work, ſo far advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced already. But the time of year would not admit of much action: for although it was <hi>April</hi> here, yet the Rays of the Sun were not of force ſufficient to pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate the congealed Clouds, and raiſe any verdure on the ground; ſo that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry could not march, unleſs they carried their fields behind them, or elſe in Carts. But this which hindered the Engliſh, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered the Scotch, and gave them leaſure to ſcrape together as many men as poſſibly
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:54215:89"/>
could be got. Out of the High-lands marcht <hi>Middleton,</hi> with a conſiderable Force of Horſe and Foot; and the Town of <hi>Dundee,</hi> out of a great reſpect to their King, and to ſhew their forwardneſs in proſecuting the cauſe, advanced for the ſervice a brave Regiment of Horſe at their own charges, and ſent them with a ſtately Tent, and ſix fair Braſs Ordnance, for a Preſent to the King then at <hi>Sterling;</hi> where all being joyned, their Army con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of 20000 men, moſt raw, or elſe but parboil'd, having ſeen no Wars but what their own Country produced; and being more acquainted with their fields then fights<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> knew better how to handle a Spade, then a Speare. But though many of them were thus, eſpecially the new-raiſed Forces; yet all were not ſo: for <hi>Scotland</hi> being always numerous in peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſupplyed the neighbour-Nations with auxiliarie Forces; ſo that many Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of them were always in the ſervice of the <hi>Swede, French, Dutch</hi> and other Nations. But now upon report of Wars in <hi>Scotland,</hi> they repaired home to ſerve in their own Nation at this time, againſt the Engliſh.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:54215:89"/>
The Scotch Army being grown nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, was ſtill augmented by Forces new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly raiſed in all parts of the Nation where the King and States had any command; yet more were deſired: to that purpoſe, the Earl of <hi>Eglington</hi> (an eminent perſon) was ſent into the VVeſt (with ſome other Commanders) to raiſe Forces: theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Dunbarton,</hi> began to put their Commiſſions in execution; but Colonel <hi>Lilburn</hi> having notice of it, ſent them a party of Horſe, which ſuddainly ſnapt the Earl himſelf, his Son Colonel <hi>James Mountgomery,</hi> Lieutenant-Colonel <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, &amp;c.</hi> whom they carried away pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners to <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lord General <hi>Cromwel</hi> had now got ſtrength to walk abroad, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the relapſe he fell into after his firſt ſickneſs; and had it not been that he was of an extraordinary ſtrong conſtitution, the Ague, which laſt of all ſeiſed upon him, might have ſhook him into the grave. But the Parliament in <hi>England</hi> ſeeing how frequent theſe diſtempers were upon their General, and doubting the air of <hi>Scotland</hi> might be the cauſe of it, the Council of State firſt of all ſent him two eminent
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:54215:90"/>
Doctors, Dr. <hi>Wright,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Bates,</hi> to uſe their utmoſt skill in his recovery; and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after diſpatched an Order into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which gave him liberty to leave the buſineſs of the Army, and repair into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> until his health and ſtrength was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.

undeſerved favour; which although it be fit I keep a thankful remembrance, yet I judge it would be too much preſumption in me not to return a particular acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I beſeech you give me the boldneſs to return my humble thankfulneſs to the Council for ſending two ſuch worthy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſo great a journey to viſit me, from whom I have received much encouragement and good direction for recovery of health and ſtrength; which I finde (by the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God) growing towards ſuch a ſtate, as may yet (if it be his good will) render me uſeful according to my poor ability, in the ſtation wherein he hath ſet me. I wiſh more ſteadineſs in your Affairs here, then to depend (in the leaſt) upon ſo frail a thing as I am: indeed they do not, nor own any Inſtrument: this Cauſe is of God, and it muſt proſper. Oh that all that have any hand therein, being ſo perſwaded, would gird up the loyns of their minds, and endeavour in all things to walk worthy of the Lord: So prays,</hi>

Although ſickneſs had a long time kept under the body of this noble General, yet his courage was no way diminiſhed by it: for no ſooner was he able to ſtir abroad, but with eager deſire of action, he conſults with the chief Officers of the Army to carry on the War. The reſult of theſe Councils was to contract the Army, by drawing in the out-guards or petty Gariſons which were of little force, and onely ſerved for <hi>Perdues</hi> to give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the Enemies motions. To <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton</hi> marcht Commiſſary-General <hi>Whally</hi> with eight Regiments of Horſe, and brought off a Troop of Dragoons, and 60 Foot which were there placed; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſeveral other places were deſerted by the Forces that kept them.</p>
               <p>The Army being thus drawn into one body, were ſupplyed with 33 Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons and Carriages for the Train from <hi>Barwick;</hi> and near upon the ſame time ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived by Sea Captain <hi>Butler</hi> in the <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,</hi> a ſtout ſhip formerly taken from the French: this was the Ship that wafted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the Golden Fleece, and ſafely ſwom into <hi>Leith</hi> with a rich Cargazon of about 80000 <hi>l,</hi> for to pay the Souldiers. This
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:54215:91"/>
money was preſently diſtributed out, to the Horſe and Foot; which mightily ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated their reſolution to the preſent Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition.</p>
               <p>All things being now ready for this <hi>Champaigne,</hi> the Lord General <hi>Cromwel</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Armies advance to <hi>Red-hall:</hi> which was cheerfully done, on <hi>June</hi> 24. 1651. At this place they onely tarried until the Souldiers had wholly quitted their Quarters, and then marched off to <hi>Pencland</hi> hills, a place which was well known to the Engliſh, ever ſince the firſt enterance of the Army into <hi>Scotland,</hi> when they took the confidence from thence to look big on the City of <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh:</hi> but now being in a braver condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then they were before, having cut through the greateſt difficulties of the VVar, and advanced their Blood-red Croſs on the top of the moſt impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble places that durſt withſtand their invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible Force; having made a breakfaſt of the South of <hi>Scotland,</hi> they intended the North for a Dinner. Therefore to make haſt, now their ſtomacks were up, the Lord General <hi>Cromwel</hi> cauſed the whole Army to pitch their Camp on <hi>Pencland</hi>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:54215:92"/>
hills, in ſuch a comely Order, and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Figure, ſo that <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> himſelf, (could he have kept death off at the ſwords point, and thereby ſurvived to this Age) might have turned Scholar, and learnt the Rudiments of Modern Diſcipline, by the Example of this excellent Commander. How amiable was it to behold the towring Tents of the ſuperiour Officers, in various Figures, and ſpreading Colours overlook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Huts of the inferiour Souldiers, like ſo many Pinacles in a well-built City, that aſpire over the humble Cottages, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtring a pleaſant object to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted Traveller! Here Military Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline reſembled the Civil Power; all knowing their Duty, and performing their Parts; whilſt General <hi>Cromwel</hi> the Head, obſerved the Actions of every Member in this great Body, with one hand ſtretched forth to reward the ſober and valiant; the other, to puniſh the cowardly and vitious. It was not here, as uſually it hath been practiſed in forraign Armies; as that of the Duke of <hi>Lorain,</hi> where the firſt queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to a new-liſted Souldier was this, <hi>Canſt thou plunder?</hi> or in ſome others, where the Van, by Rapine and deſtruction, make Skeletons of the Rear.</p>

While the Army lay thus incamped, the Lord General in his Tent feaſted his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and ſeveral of their Ladies, as the Lady <hi>Lambert,</hi> and Major General <hi>Deans</hi> Lady, with ſeveral other Engliſh Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women, who came from <hi>Leith</hi> to view the Souldiers in their Tents, and afterwards returned back to the places from whence they came.</p>
               <p>The Army continued not long in this poſture: for General <hi>Cromwel</hi> ſeeing the weather invited, and intelligence of the Scots being at <hi>Falkirk,</hi> requiring a ſpeedy advance, he therefore drew forth the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to meet them, which we ſhall muſter in their March, and ſet down the names of the particular Colonels, with their Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, both of Horſe and Foot, which were actual in this Expedition, that ſo the remembrance of theſe worthy Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders may be preſerved.</p>

This brave Cavalry and gallant Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, in proſecution of the preſent deſign, firſt marched to <hi>New-bridge,</hi> from thence to <hi>Lithgow.</hi> Now the two Armies being not far from one another, it was conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſpeedy ingagement would follow, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing General <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s courage prompted him to ſeek his Enemies; and the numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the Scots Army might be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion to them not to fear a Fight: But it ſeems, they intended nothing leſs; for the King having drawn his Foot into <hi>Torwood,</hi> incamped there, and railed them in with regular Fortifications, the Horſe in great Bodies lying about them, for ſecurity; and theſe again being fenced with the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and with Bogs, ſo that it was an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible thing for the Engliſh to drive them out of this faſtneſs which they had betaken themſelves to. Yet however, the Lord General would try whether pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations might draw the Scots to a fairer field, and therefore marched his Army in Battalia ſo near their main Body, that their Tents might perfectly be diſcerned; and ſo ſtood from twelve at noon, till eight at night, expecting the Scots approach: but they having more mind to ſpin out time,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:54215:94"/>
then to put all to the hazard of one Battel, refuſed an ingagement. But becauſe it ſhould not be ſaid the Engliſh came there for nothing, therefore the Scots ſent them ſome thundring Meſſengers from the concavity of their great Guns, which wrought this effect; that the Lord Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Cromwel</hi> drew off his Army, with a reſolution not quite to deſert the ſervice, but rather to go back ſome few paces, that ſo he might return again with the greater force; or elſe attempt the Scots Quarters in ſome other places, and by that means, inforce his Enemies to ſeek to him for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of their Friends.</p>
               <p>This reſolution being taken up, the Lord General drew off his Army to <hi>Glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gow;</hi> and after ſome ſmall refreſhment of his wearied Souldiers, he marched away again, directly on the Eaſt ſide of the Town, and ſo continued in excellent order marching on for five or, ſix miles towards <hi>Hamilton,</hi> (this was to amuſe the Scots, and bring them into ſecurity:) but upon the ſuddain, hoping to get ſome advantage over the Scots, upon the remove of their Camp to <hi>Kelſith,</hi> he wheeled about, and quickly after took up his Quarters at
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:54215:94"/>
                  <hi>Monkes-Land,</hi> within four miles of their Army. But though they ſtill declined in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, refuſing to meddle with the Engliſh, otherwayes then by ſmall parties, that ſometimes flew out, when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived any advantage might be gained; yet many of theſe Land-Pickaroons were often met withal, and ſent home again well Baſtinado'd for their boldneſs.</p>
               <p>This ſpinning out of time in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſo exaſperated the Lord General <hi>Cromwel,</hi> that he reſolved to fall upon part of their Forces that were placed to keep <hi>Kalendar-Houſe.</hi> Accordingly, <hi>July</hi> 15. he cauſed two battering Guns to be plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: they began to play about eleven of the clock that day; and about ſeven at night they had acted their parts ſo well, that the wall no longer being able to indure the force of theſe fiery Engines, fell down in many places; and yet for all this, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor very ſtoutly made good his charge; believing that the whole Scotch Army his friends, who were in ſight, would never let him periſh for want of relief, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reſolved to ſtand it out to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt. The Lord General ſeeing his Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons wrought little effect to the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:54215:95"/>
of his ends, ſent ten Files out of every Regiment, to pull them out by force, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they would not yeild for fear: theſe ſtout Lads being provided with Faggots preſently diſ-burdened their backs in the Enemies Moat, and ſo ſpringing over into the breach, carried all before them, ſo that in half an hour, the Houſe was wholly poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt, and the Governor with ſixty two Souldiers hurried away into another world, having refuſed (when they might) to live in this. The Scotch Army all this while moved not, but as paſſive Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors beheld this Tragedy, without offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſend one hand to help their friends in diſtreſs, as if this buſineſs nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned them. The Lord General ſeeing how cowardly the Scots were, in that they ſuffered their Gariſons to be ſnatched a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from under their Noſes, reſolves to ſit yet more cloſe upon their skirts, and bid fair for <hi>Fife,</hi> thereby to cut off thoſe ſupplies of proviſions that inabled them to trifle out time, and protract the VVar. This deſign had many times been diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of by the General and his Council of VVar, but never before fell out ſo fit an opportunity as was now preſented.</p>

VVherefore Colonel <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Foot, having four Companies more joyned with them, and four Troops of Horſe, all under the command of that valiant Souldier, Col, <hi>Overton,</hi> were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for this ſervice: theſe lying at <hi>Leith,</hi> it was given out, they were intended for <hi>England</hi> by Sea; but upon a ſudden, all proviſions being in a readineſs, the Boats and Pinaces alſo fitted for Service, Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Overton</hi> marched with his Forces out of <hi>Leith,</hi> to <hi>Queens Ferry;</hi> and there ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving imbarqued his men, Thurſday <hi>July</hi> 17. in the evening, this Brigade ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and the next morning very early, (being furthered by the wings of Sails and Oars) this little Fleet flew over the <hi>Frith</hi> into <hi>Fife,</hi> and landed at the North-Ferry, in ſpight of thoſe ſhowers of great and ſmall ſhot that were poured upon them at their approaching the ſhore: in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change whereof, Colonel <hi>Overton</hi> cauſed his men to pay them in their own coyn, by firing upon them out of the Boats: which being performed with admirable courage and gallantry, made the Scots break off the diſpute, and (notwithſtanding their advantage of firm footing, when the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:54215:96"/>
ſtood on a very tottering foundation) betake themſelves to their heels, leaving behinde them part of their Arms and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Overton</hi> being thus landed, made good his ground, by cauſing his ſouldiers to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Pioneers, and to intrench them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, for greater ſecurity, until more Forces might come up to them; upon whoſe conjunction, they would be enabled to march up into the Country, without fear of any oppoſition. To this purpoſe, Meſſengers were with all ſpeed poſted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to the Lord General, to acquaint him with their good ſucceſs, and the preſent poſture of their affairs; who thereupon immediately ordered a ſupply of two Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments of Horſe and two of Foot to be haſted away with all expedition, under the conduct of Major-General <hi>Lambert.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The news of theſe paſſages arriving at the Scotiſh Camp, gave them ſo hot an Alarm, that in all haſte Major-General <hi>Brown</hi> is diſpatched away with four Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Horſe, and Major-General <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born</hi> with as many of Foot, to drive the Engliſh out of <hi>Fyfe</hi> again. But they loſt their aim: for <hi>Lambert</hi> getting the ſtart
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:54215:96"/>
of them, came up to the relief of <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> ere they could approach to ſtraiten him. The Engliſh being thus united, <hi>Lambert</hi> drew them up in Battalia in a very formal manner, in this order: His own Regiment of Horſe, with the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons of Col. <hi>Okey</hi> and Col. <hi>Morgan,</hi> made the Right Wing; Colonel <hi>Lidcot</hi>'s three Troops of Horſe, with ſome Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons, made the Left: the Main Body conſiſted of the Regiments of Major-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Lambert,</hi> Colonel <hi>West,</hi> and Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Daniel,</hi> of Foot; with ſome odde Companies more, which were edged in to the greateſt advantage.</p>
               <p>The Scots finding the Engliſh in this poſture, were not at all diſcouraged; but expreſſing greater reſolution then uſually they had done, ſet their men in Battel aray, and ſtoutly confronted their adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries. Both Parties having faced each other for the ſpace of an hour and an half, <hi>Lambert</hi> with the Right Wing of his Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel fell on the Enemy with great fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, giving the firſt Charge on the Scots Left wing; which they (not flinching a foot) manfully ſuſtained, returning like for like. Thus continuing for ſome time,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:54215:97"/>
the Scale of ſucceſs ſtanding in <hi>equipon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dio,</hi> the Piſtols having now done their part, the fury of theſe Antagoniſts grew to ſuch a hight, that flinging away thoſe more cowardly weapons, every man drew upon his oppoſite, and with ſwords point char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged thorow each other. But this was too hot to hold: for the Engliſh being very dextrous in that kinde of fighting, quickly routed the Enemies Left wing, and made them flee, leaving a fair field. Neither were the reſt of the Forces on both ſides idle ſpectators, but induſtriouſly acted their parts in their ſeveral ſtations. The Foot that conſtituted the Main Body of the Engliſh, traverſing their ground, ſo reiterated their Vollies, that they ſeemed to cauſe an earthquake. But the Scotch Horſe being utterly diſſipated, their Foot could not ſtand long; who being left to the mercy of their Enemy, in this heat of bloud, found it cruel, being little other then what was diſpenſed at the but-end of their Muskets, (eſpecially to the High-landers.) In a word, and that in plain Engliſh, ſo enraged were the Engliſh, that in a trice they beſtrewed the place with 2000 Scots, or thereabout, as ſo many ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of mortality.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:54215:97"/>
Neither were the Captives inconſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, either for their quality or number, they being as followeth, <hi>viz.</hi> Major-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Brown</hi> Commander in chief; one Colonel, one Lieutenant-Colonel, one Major, thirteen Captains, ſeventeen Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants, nine and twenty Enſignes, five Quartermaſters, ſix and twenty Sergeants, five and twenty Corporals, and One thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand two hundred twenty and ſix common ſouldiers, with fourty and two Colours of Horſe and Foot. <hi>Brown</hi> having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this Defeat, (which conſiſted not onely in the loſs of ſo many conſiderable Forces, but the wounding of his Honour and Reputation, more valued then life by a Generous minde) and being himſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the condition of a priſoner, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived not long; dying (as was conceived) of very grief for his hard fate.</p>
               <p>But the Engliſh triumph in their victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſtill ſeeking to augment it, by farther Exploits: now the Terrour of this Blow had ſpread it ſelf into all the Scots Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; and therefore <hi>Lambert</hi> firſt of all ſummons the impregnable Fort of <hi>Inneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garvey,</hi> ſituate in an Iſle lying in the <hi>Frith,</hi> betwixt <hi>Queens Ferry,</hi> and the Paſs into
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:54215:98"/>
                  <hi>Fife.</hi> The Gariſon here was poſſeſt with ſuch a pannick fear, that upon ſummons, they were content to march away, with their ſwords onely by their ſides, (to ſhew what profeſſion they were of) and leave the Fort, with all the Arms, Ammunition and proviſion, with ſixteen pieces of Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, behinde them, for the uſe of the Engliſh.</p>
               <p>The Scots King having the report of this great overthrow of his Forces brought to <hi>Torwood,</hi> where he ſtill lay ſtrongly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>campt, it wrought ſuch a great diſtraction in his Army, that he very haſtily diſlodg'd, and marched into <hi>Sterling</hi> Park. But they could not be ſo quick in the retreat, but General <hi>Cromwel</hi> (who ſtill waited up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them) was as nimble in the Rear; who although he had much diminiſhed his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, by ſending ſo many into <hi>Fife,</hi> yet ſtill indeavoured to fight the whole Army of his Enemies, and marched after them through the ground they lately poſſeſs'd, and there found what pannick fear had poſſeſt them, who in haſt had left behinde them all their ſick ſouldiers, one barrel of Powder, three of Ball, much Match, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Muſquets, and three barrels of Hand-Granadoes.
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:54215:98"/>
Thus the Lord General fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them with provocations to move them to fight, until he came within two miles of <hi>Sterling;</hi> but all to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: for they would neither bark nor bite, but haſted away to ſecure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>The Lord General ſeeing his ſtay here would be to little purpoſe, marched away his Army the 22 of <hi>July</hi> to <hi>Lithgo,</hi> whence he ſent over into <hi>Fife,</hi> the greateſt part of them, with the Train of Artillery, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute the War on the other ſide of the water. Now there remaining onely four Regiments of Horſe, and four of Foot behinde, thoſe he made uſe of to ſecure what was already gained, and to keep a watchful eye on the Scots future Motions. The Lord General himſelf retired to <hi>Leith,</hi> there to take order for the ſupplie of his ſouldiers. Whilſt he ſtaid here, the happy news of the ſurrender of <hi>Brunt-Iſland</hi> arrived to his Ears: for Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor General <hi>Lambert</hi> proſecuting his good fortune, brought the Army before that Iſland, in hope that the ſight of his Red-Coats might daunt them into a ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. And herein he was not deceived:
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:54215:99"/>
for no ſooner was he come before it, but without one ſhot made, the Scots deſired Articles to depart in peace: which <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> (though a man of War) quickly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended to; and ſo the place was yeil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon theſe Conditions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Souldiers in Gariſon</hi> (who were about five hundred) <hi>ſhould march a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with flying Colours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That the Towns People ſhould have what belonged to them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>That all proviſions for War, together with all Guns and ſhipping of War, ſhould be delivered up for the uſe of the Common-Wealth of</hi> England.</p>
               <p>This place was of great concernment: for beſides the ſtrength of it, it was a moſt commodious Harbour, and, in many reſpects, better then that at <hi>Leith;</hi> and from thence the Army in the progreſs of their Conqueſts, might have conſtant ſupplies of all neceſſaries.</p>
               <p>The Lord General having diſpatched his Affairs at <hi>Leith,</hi> made no ſtay, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly croſt the <hi>Frith,</hi> to his Army then at <hi>Brunt Iſland,</hi> where he finds all things
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:54215:99"/>
governed by <hi>Lambert,</hi> with much Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Policie; the Souldiers couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and Commiſſary General <hi>Whalley</hi> with a ſtrong Party of Horſe abroad, ſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Sea-ſide of <hi>Fife,</hi> having ſome Men of War by Sea attending his Motion. The Activity of this excellent Commander was very eminent, who quickly ſubjugated many ſmall Forts, and poſſeſt himſelf of all their Artillery, with the Ships and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces, that lay near them, for ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>Having now brought his Affairs to a very hopeful condition, the Lord General placed Colonel <hi>Weſts</hi> Regiment in <hi>Brunt Iſland,</hi> and with the reſt of the Army and Train of Artillery, <hi>July</hi> 30. 1651. he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched away to reduce St. <hi>Johnſtons,</hi> thereby to ſtop the High-landers from offering to ſend any Supplies to <hi>Sterling,</hi> either of Men or Proviſions. The ſwiftneſs of this March was ſuch, that in two dayes the Engliſh Army came within ſight of the Town: and no ſooner had they faced the ſame, but intelligence informed the Lord General what ſmall reſiſtance he was like to meet withal: which news was no way unwelcome, but moſt acceptable: for now
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:54215:100"/>
'twas hoped to obtain poſſeſſion by words, not by ſwords; and therefore this Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons was ſent in:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That being informed the Town was void of a Gariſon, ſave the inhabitants, and ſome few Country men, he thought fit to ſend to them, to deliver the ſame to him immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and that he did thereby promiſe to ſecure their Perſons from violence, and their goods from plunder.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Meſſage was immediately ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by a Trumpeter, who (as it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived) would blow open the Gates, and make a free entrance for the whole Army; but it fell out contrary to expectation: for this Meſſenger of Peace approaching one of the Gates, he was denyed admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and returned back again by the Townſ-men with a ſhort Reply, <hi>That they were not in a capacity to receive any Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi> This ſlighting of Peace, had like to have made them uncapable of Mercy, but that a ſpeedy excuſe from the Magiſtrates of the Town was ſent forth, to mend the matter, which declared, <hi>That the Kings Majeſty had ſent a very ſtrong Party, able
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:54215:100"/>
to maintain the Town, and over-power them with a Governour: But alwayes to obſerve civility with his Lordſhip, they had obtained leave from the Governour to excuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, by ſhewing how unable they were to treat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was ſtrange, but not ſo ſtrange as true: For the day before, the Lord <hi>Daf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feres</hi> had entered the town with 1300 ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers; and therefore General <hi>Cromwel</hi> once more reſolved to try the ſtrength of his pen in a new Summons to this new Governour, before they felt the fury of his ſword. But this was to little purpoſe: for <hi>Dafferes</hi> would not return the leaſt line or word in anſwer. This ſullen ſilence cauſed the General to give a ſpeedy Order for draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away the Water out of the Moats round about the Town, whilſt three Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Foot, Col. <hi>Prides, Reads</hi> and <hi>Maliverers,</hi> boldly advanced, and planted four great Guns, which plaid furiouſly into the Town: this continued for one night; but the Governour next day find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf in an Errour, was unwilling to perſiſt any longer in it, for fear of being brought to the ſtool of Repentance; and therefore ſent out to deſire a Treaty:
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:54215:101"/>
which being concluded upon, it was there agreed to deliver up the Town to the Lord General.</p>
               <p>Thus the Engliſh Army run on in a continued Series of Succeſſes, making all places that offered to withſtand their invincible force, bow in obedience, and come under their command; and all this without the leaſt oppoſition from the Scots grand Army, commanded by the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, which had lain long in and about <hi>Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> ſtrongly intrenched, as if their onely deſign had been to defend themſelves, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as 'twas thought) to offend their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and therefore continued their ſtation to no other purpoſe then to bring up the Rear in <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Triumphs. But it fell out otherwayes: for the Engliſh Army ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving advanced as far Northwards as <hi>St. Johnſtons,</hi> the King thought good to make uſe of the preſent opportunity, ſeeing his Affairs in <hi>Scotland</hi> were reduced to a deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate condition; and fearing the fate that hung over that Nation would inevitably fall upon his own head, did not he prevent it by ſome extraordinary means; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore knowing <hi>a deſperate Diſeaſe</hi> requires
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:54215:101"/>
                  <hi>a deſperate Cure,</hi> and that being in a houſe ready to fall, it would be the ſafeſt courſe, by a ſudden departure, to ſave himſelf, by ſeeking a better Habitation; he preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly took that courſe. To which end, firſt of all, caſting up his force, he found it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to about 16000 ſtrong: with theſe, and hopes of farther help from Friends, he reſolves to venter for <hi>England</hi> it ſelf, not doubting, if his ſucceſs anſwered his deſires, to hook in both <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> into the Bargain. This Reſolution he reſolves to put in execution, and therefore haſtens his ſouldiers to drive on the deſign.</p>
               <p>Thurſday, <hi>July</hi> 31. 1651. all things being in readineſs, the Scotch Army began their march from <hi>Sterling,</hi> and the ſixth day after, entered <hi>England,</hi> by the way of <hi>Carliſle.</hi> The noyſe of this Irruption made a terrible Eccho through all the Nation, eſpecially in the ears of the Parliament at <hi>Weſtminster,</hi> who were much ſtartled with the ſuddenneſs of the Action. But they (like vigilant Statiſts) doubting ſuch a thing would happen, had beforehand pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided to welcome theſe new-come Gueſts: and firſt of all, Major General <hi>Harriſon,</hi> attended by 3000 Horſe and Dragoons,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:54215:102"/>
joyning himſelf with Colonel <hi>Rich,</hi> and ſome other great Commanders, marched away to ſalute them upon their entrance into <hi>England.</hi> Then an Act was iſſued forth, and ſent into all the Counties of the Nation, to raiſe up the Militia into a preſent poſture of Defence; and beſides, to make all ſure, another Act was preſently ſent abroad, which prohibited correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency with <hi>Charles Stuart,</hi> or any of his Party; wherein it was enacted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That no perſon whatſoever ſhould preſume to hold any correſpondencie with the ſaid</hi> Charles Stuart, <hi>or with his Party, or with any of them, nor give any intelligence to them, nor countenance, encourage, abet, adhere to, or aſſiſt any of them, nor voluntarily afford, or cauſe to be afforded or delivered to any of them, any Victuals, Proviſions, Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Arms, Horſes, Plate, Money, Men, or any other Relief whatſoever, under pain of High Treaſon. And that all perſons ſhould uſe their utmoſt endeavours to hinder and ſtop their March.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet for all this, the Scots went on in
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:54215:102"/>
proſecution of their preſent deſigne, bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their courſe, by a ſwift March, for the weſt of <hi>England,</hi> where we will leave them, making more haſt then good ſpeed; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn back again to the Lord Gen. <hi>Cromwel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He having notice at <hi>St. Johnſtons,</hi> that the Scots Army were gone to take up new Quarters in <hi>England,</hi> did immediately ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle the Affairs of <hi>Scotland</hi> in a poſture ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſecure what was already won; and leaving ſix thouſand Horſe and Foot more, with Lieutenant General <hi>Mork,</hi> to reduce the reſt, he cauſes Major General <hi>Lambert</hi> with five Regiments of Horſe and Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons, to fly away with all poſſible ſpeed, to get into the Rear of the Scots Army, whilſt <hi>Hariſon</hi> was in their Front; ſo to impede their March, until himſelf could get up unto them. This being done, with the remainder of the Army, conſiſting of eight Regiments of Foot, two of Horſe, and eight great Guns, this victorious Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral marched away, leaving <hi>Scotland</hi> (but not the remembrance of his being there) and on <hi>Auguſt</hi> 12. he with his Army croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Tine.</hi> With this ſwift March being quite tired out, he cauſed the Army to pitch their Tents on <hi>Ryſon Haugh,</hi> upon the
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:54215:103"/>
brink of <hi>Tine;</hi> himſelf in the mean time quartering at <hi>Stelly Houſe,</hi> neer unto his Souldiers.</p>
               <p>The Mayor of <hi>New-Caſtle,</hi> having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the Armies being thus neer the Town, immediately went forth with the reſt of the Magiſtrates, to congratulate the Generals arrival into <hi>England:</hi> And to make themſelves welcome to the Souldiers, they carried along with them, for ſupply of the Army, Bread, Cheeſe, Biſcet and Beer: theſe Proviſions were a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing, and inabled the Souldiers with cheerfulneſs to undertake the future march.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, the Scots with their King, marched on towards <hi>Warrington</hi> Bridge, where Maj. Gen. <hi>Hariſon</hi> reſolved to make oppoſition againſt them, and if poſſible to hinder their paſſage over: but before they could break down the Bridge, the Scots by a ſwift March from <hi>Charley</hi> came up; and being neceſſarily engaged, they maintained a notable combate with thoſe that offered to withſtand them: here they had a ſmall bruſh, but could very well afford it, for the loſs was their gain (and ſo both ſides were ſatisfied with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement)
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:54215:103"/>
for though ſome of their men fell in the fight, yet they had their deſire, which was to paſs over the bridge. And now it was the great Queſtion of all, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they intended to bend their courſe; moſt believed for <hi>London,</hi> being that was the Metropolis of the Engliſh Nation, a populous City, well furniſhed with a great Magazine of Men and Money; the firſt, being the Wheels of War; the laſt, the Oyl, which makes them turn nimbly about. But it ſeems the Scots looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this as too hazardous, or elſe intended onely to take the dimenſions of the Land, and when that was done, to return home again to their own Kingdom. However, they marched on towards the Weſt, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all civility to the people as they paſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long; and with ſuch ſtrict Diſcipline were they governed, that as their Army march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through <hi>Shropſhire,</hi> a private Souldier for offering to enter an Orchard, was by his Officer immediately disbanded with a Bullet. By this ſeverity their rough-hewn natures were ſo poliſhed, that if Neceſſity drove any private Souldier to a door, he durſt ſpeak no other Language, then, <hi>A Drink of Water.</hi> But now at laſt, their
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:54215:104"/>
Peregrination ends at <hi>Worceſter;</hi> for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thither, weak and weary with conſtant duty, and hard labour, having expected much, out finding little, they here reſolve to take up their Quarters, hoping <hi>Maſſey</hi>'s former ſervices in <hi>Glouceſterſhire,</hi> and thoſe parts, was not quite buried in the Grave of Oblivion. But in this they found it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: for although they might love his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon well, yet ſeeing his parts ingaged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Grain of the Times, it quite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienated the affections of thoſe that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe might wiſh him well.</p>
               <p>The Scotch King with his Army having thus entered <hi>Worcester,</hi> on Friday <hi>August</hi> the 23. 1651. reſolved (being he could go no further) to tarry there, and abide the brunt: And therefore in the firſt place, becauſe he would not be wanting in any thing that might conduce to the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of himſelf and forces, he cauſed works to be raiſed, for better ſecurity. Then he ſent forth his Letters Mandatory to Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Mackworth,</hi> Governout of <hi>Shrewsbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi> and likewiſe to Sir <hi>Thomas Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> to perſwade them to raiſe Forces for him: but this proved fruitleſs; ſo that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now got as it were in a pound, there
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:54215:104"/>
was no way, but to make the beſt of a bad bargain. And now the black and diſmal clouds began to gather about <hi>Worceſter,</hi> which portended a dreadful ſtorm would quickly follow, as preſently after it did: For victorious <hi>Cromwel</hi> (who by delaies never contributed to approaching dangers) having refreſhed his men neer <hi>New-Caſtle,</hi> marched away without the leaſt delay or loſs of time, until he came to joyn with the reſt of the Parliaments Forces, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Lieutenant General <hi>Fleetwood,</hi> Major General <hi>Desborough,</hi> the Lord <hi>Gray</hi> of <hi>Groby,</hi> Major General <hi>Lambert,</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor General <hi>Hariſon;</hi> and beſides all theſe, the Militia Forces out of every County were commanded to march away, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round thoſe wretched men at <hi>Worceſter,</hi> that ſo a quick diſpatch might be put to the work.</p>
               <p>Never was it known before in <hi>England,</hi> that ſuch great Forces were gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in ſo ſmall a time; for the ſtanding Army, with the reſt of thoſe Forces newly raiſed by Act of Parliament, upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, could not amount to leſs then eighty thouſand. But now the Lord Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Cromwel</hi> being come up, and having
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:54215:105"/>
obſerved the poſture that the Scoth Army lay in, began his work with an attempt upon <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pton</hi> Bridge; there intending, if it was poſſible, to paſs over his Army: this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne was left to Major General <hi>Fleetwoods</hi> management, who preſently ſent away a ſmall party of Horſe and Dragoons to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover how feaſible the attempt might be: this Party, though ſmall, proved daring in a deſperate attempt: for finding the bridge broken down, and nothing remaining, but onely a Beam of Timber that reached from one Arch to another, (which through neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence had been left by the Scots) theſe bold Fellows made no more ado, but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting their Horſes one after another, rid over on this Wooden <hi>Pegaſus,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after (having now recovered the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide) run themſelves into a Church neer to the bridge for ſecurity. Major Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Maſſey</hi> being all this while in <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pton</hi> with about 60 Dragoons, and 200 Horſe, lying ſecure, without the leaſt dread of an Enemy, imagining it impoſſible for any to come at him at that time, was upon the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den report of this Exploit, ſo alarmed, that in great conſuſion, he with his men, gave a camiſado on the Church: but that valiant
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:54215:105"/>
Commander <hi>Lambert,</hi> highly prizing the worth of his men, immediately came in, with a new ſupply of Horſe, to their reſcue. <hi>Maſſey</hi> now ſeeing that to fight would be meer folly, being much over-matched, thought a timely retreat the onely way to ſecure his men; which he performed with ſo much bravery, that ſometimes facing, then fighting, and ſo falling off, himſelf brought up the Rear, and never left his ſtation, until his men were got farther off, into ſafety. This encounter at laſt fell hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy on himſelf; for he not fearing his fleſh, and deſpiſing the force of his Enemies, rencountered great difficulty in getting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, having received a ſhot in his hand.</p>
               <p>The Bridge being thus won, all imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able induſtry was imployed to make it up; ſo that in a ſmall time, Lieutenant Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Fleetwoods</hi> Army marched over; which ſtill preſſing forward, they laid a Bridge of Boats over the River <hi>Teame,</hi> (on the weſt ſide of <hi>Severn,</hi> which gliding along, at laſt emptieth it ſelf thereinto, about a mile be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath <hi>Worceſter.)</hi> General <hi>Cromwel,</hi> in the mean time, cauſed another Bridge to be laid over the <hi>Severn</hi> on his ſide, that ſo the Enemy might be the more ſtraitned.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:54215:106"/>
Upon this, the Scots having taken the alarm, riſe from their Leaguer at St. <hi>Jones,</hi> and with the greateſt part of their Horſe and Foot marched on to oppoſe the Lieut. Generals paſſage. The Lord General ſeeing this, reſolves to draw off the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and ſo divert his deſign; or elſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force him to fight on great diſadvantage; therefore himſelf in perſon led over the River (on that ſide of <hi>Worceſter</hi> which he had undertook to attaque) two Regiments of Foot, Colonel <hi>Hookers</hi> of Horſe, and his own Life-Guard. In the mean time, <hi>Fleetwood,</hi> with the aſſiſtance of Colonel <hi>Goff's</hi> and Major General <hi>Dean's</hi> Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Foot, marched on to a hedg-fight: for the Scots looking upon this as the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt way, had lined the hedges thick with Muſqueteers; ſo that the Buſhes muſt firſt be beaten, before theſe Birds could be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. This was not long in doing; for the Engliſh falling on, perform'd a brave fight from hedge to hedge: the Scots on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, not loſing any thing that could be kept, but manfully maintaining their ground, until Colonel <hi>Blake, Gibbons,</hi> and <hi>Marſhes</hi> Regiments came in to lay more load on their ſhoulders; then they retrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:54215:106"/>
to <hi>Pawick</hi> Bridge, where again they were ingaged with Col. <hi>Hayns,</hi> Col. <hi>Cobbets,</hi> and Col. <hi>Matthew's</hi> Regiments, in another hot diſpute: but at length, ſeeing they could not prevail, they provided for their own ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity by running into <hi>Worceſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now deſperation animating their courage, knowing that to continue in this pound, would make them in a pitiful pickle, therefore (having already tried their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune with Lieutenant General <hi>Fleetwood)</hi> they imagining him to have commanded the greater force, they hoped to make a more fortunate ſally againſt General <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel;</hi> therefore upon the ſudden, they ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied out againſt him, with all the Horſe and Foot they could; but (as it proved) with ſad ſucceſs, for though at firſt they ſhewed ſuch activity in their Arms, that General <hi>Cromwels</hi> men were forced alittle to retire, yet preſently the multitudes of freſh men coming in, ſo turned the ſcales, that the Scots were wholly routed, flying away in great confuſion, to ſave themſelves: the Horſe flew amain back again, towards the North; but the Foot not able to keep com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, ran into <hi>Worceſter,</hi> with ſome of the Victors at their heels. Whilſt, in the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:54215:107"/>
mean time, General <hi>Cromwel,</hi> to make ſure work, with a few Regiments of Foot, ran up to the Royal Fort; and being ready to ſtorm, his clemencie was ſeen, in ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his perſon through the ſhowers of ſhot, and offering the Scots quarter if they would preſently yield. But they being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatuated, refuſed the profer, which cauſed their too late repentance; for the Lord General falling on, quickly poſſeſt the Fort, and all the Artillery that was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
               <p>The City being now won, the ſouldiers ſuriouſly fly through all the ſtreets, doing ſuch execution, that nothing could be ſeen for ſome time, but blood and ſlaughter, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til at laſt, the ſack of the Town, and plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Priſoners having ſatisfied their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, they fall to ſecuring of Priſoners, which (both in fight and flight) amounted to about 10000, the Ilain neer 3000. ſo that neer all was loſt, onely ſome few Horſe excepted, which eſcaped out of the Battel; but theſe found their flight to ſtand them in little ſtead: for Major Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Hariſon</hi> with a freſh party, fiercely purſued in their Rear, whilſt the Country people fronted and flanked them like little
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:54215:107"/>
Beagles, which when a Maſtiff is once beaten, will not let him paſs without a ſnarle at his tail, and fiercely purſue him, whom before they durſt not look in the face.</p>
               <p>This Battle put a period to the Good Fortune of the <hi>Stuarts</hi> Family; and on the other ſide, crowned General <hi>Cromwels</hi> Atchievements, with an abſolute ſecurity of all his former Conqueſts, the influence whereof (though acted in <hi>England)</hi> was great in <hi>Scotland:</hi> their chief Nobility, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and private ſouldiers being thus cut off, that Nation could no longer be able to hold up its head, but quickly after muſt needs be brought under obedience to the Commonwealth of <hi>England:</hi> as it fell out ſoon after.</p>
               <p>The Parliament at <hi>London,</hi> having ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy notice of this proſperous ſucceſs, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it with grateful acceptation. But that which abated ſomewhat of their Triumphs, was, That the King could not be numbred among the Captives, nor found among the Slain, but was ſlip'd away into ſome by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place: for he ſeeing that all the Enemies aim was onely to ſmite him, and that they <hi>did not fight ſo much againſt ſmall or great,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:54215:108"/>
as againſt the King of Scots;</hi> finding the battel to go hard on his ſide, he left caring for others, to provide for himſelf: know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing full well, that ſhould he be taken, his Quarter would be Quartering; and that without the help of an Aſtrologer, it might eaſily be prognoſticated what Death he ſhould die. Therefore truſting more to horſe then men, and fear adding wings to his flight, he haſtened with all ſpeed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Lancaſhire;</hi> but by the way (doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that much company would do him little good, but rather be a means to cauſe his ſooner diſcovery) leaving the Road, he wandered for ſome time about <hi>England,</hi> till at laſt, finding a fit opportunity, he return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed back again into <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus this object of worldly Mutability, having ventured at all, could enjoy no more then the heavy Load of his own Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes; having been onely <hi>Tantalized</hi> with the Golden Apples of ſweet Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, but never ſuffered to ſatisfie his appetite with their fruition: for coming into <hi>Scotland,</hi> his Government was cut out to him by ſhreds, as pleaſed the Kirk and States of that Kingdom; and being a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, he muſt be carved to, not ſuffered to
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:54215:108"/>
ſerve himſelf, for fear of ſurfeits, like <hi>Zan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha Panza</hi>'s Doctors, that ſlipt away the diſhes out of reſpect to his health, whilſt in the mean time, they went about to ſtarve him: Even ſo theſe State-Doctors dieted this poor Prince for ſome time, fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him with hopes and expectations of his deſire; and then at laſt, give him no more, but onely a Nut without the Kernel, a Crown without a Kingdom: ſo that his Commands were preſently countermanded by a ſtronger, and made invalid by Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Cromwels</hi> ſword, who never left hunting him from place to place, till at laſt he was forc'd to flee into <hi>Flanders</hi> for ſhelter, where he now remains.</p>
               <p>The Lord General <hi>Cromwel</hi> having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven this deadly blow at <hi>Worceſter, Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> 3. 1651. which laid the Scots hopes low in the duſt, and thereby raiſed to himſelf a full aſſurance of the ſecurity of all his former Conqueſts, tarried no longer in that City, then to ſee the Walls of it level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the ground, and the Dikes fill'd with Earth, that ſo the diſaffection of the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants might be bridled from attempting to ſecure any future Enemy. And now
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:54215:109"/>
leaving this <hi>Golgotha,</hi> he haſtened away to offer his victorious Palms at the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments feet: Accordingly, <hi>September</hi> 12. approaching neer to <hi>London,</hi> the Speaker, with the Members of Parliament, and the Lord Preſident of the Council of State, with the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and ſome hundreds more of Quality, met him with demonſtrations of extream affection, to congratulate all his Noble Atchievements, and Worthy Exploits: here they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on his Valour, making large notes on his Victories: the more, becauſe he had done much in a ſmall time, bringing that about in fifteen Months, which was rather judged to be the work of ſo many years; having in this time quite diſpelled thoſe Vapours (fearful to the Parliament) which were exhaled by the Rayes of Regality, and once more made the ſerenity of Peace to ſhine in our Hemiſphere. Thus the Lord General was received in Triumph, (having before ſent his Trophies, the <hi>Scotch</hi> Priſoners) with great acclamations, and conducted to his houſe neer <hi>White-hall.</hi> And after ſome ſmall repoſe there, he and his valiant Lieutenant-General went to take up their places in the Parliament,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:54215:109"/>
where the Speaker in a congratulatory O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration acknowledged the Obligation of the State to them for their indefatigable indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry.</p>
               <p>The ſame day the Lord Mayor of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> (to compleat the rejoycing, and ſhew his gratitude in behalf of the City) feaſted the General and his chief Officers. This being ended, with mutual returns of thanks, the Lord General took his leave, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned back again, to conſider what was farther to be done for the ſettlement of the nation: This is his next Work; And what he did in order to the accompliſhing thereof, we now come to ſhew.</p>

               <head>HIS ACTIONS In the PROTECTORSHIP.</head>
               <p>THE Engliſh Nation having by a Civil War baniſhed Monarchy with an <hi>Exit Tyrannus,</hi> preſently inſtitute an Oligarchy, which (to give them their due) acted in their Infancy like <hi>Hercules</hi> in the Cradle, ſtifling all thoſe Serpents that offered to <hi>hiſs</hi> againſt their Authority; and with ſuch vigor proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted they their deſignes, that both <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> were inforc't to yeild obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to their commands.</p>
               <p>The Authority of this Power being thus miraculouſly extended, it grew at length
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:54215:110"/>
dreadful to the neighbouring Nations, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially the Dutch, a people who of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, were moſt ſenſible of the growing greatneſs of the Engliſh Commonwealth: they knowing full well, that two neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring States of equal greatneſs could never long agree, being ſtill jealous of each others actions: which jealouſie cauſing miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtruction, would at laſt break forth into open hoſtility.</p>
               <p>Examples are frequent in this kinde; <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Carthage</hi> ſo long contended, till the one was ended. They firſt fell out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Iſland of <hi>Sicily,</hi> and ſo by degrees this fewd extended it ſelf through all thoſe Nations where either ſide had any domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. But at laſt a peace being patched up, it continued until the ſecond Punick War, wherein <hi>Carthage</hi> was made a Puny indeed, and brought under ſubjection to <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another Example we have in that moſt noble Republick <hi>Venice,</hi> whoſe firſt Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders being hunted by the barbarous <hi>Huns,</hi> out of <hi>Italy,</hi> were fain to ſhelter themſelves by flying unto ſome little barren Iſlands, which lay in the <hi>Adriatick</hi> Gulph; where neceſſity putting an edge upon induſtry, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:54215:111"/>
theſe people to begin an admirable Structure, which ſince hath been increaſed to ſuch a magnitude and ſplendor, that it may well be termed, <hi>The Worlds Wonder,</hi> for the excellent Architecture, multitude of Bridges, rare Arſenal or Magazine: but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, the Policie of this State far ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth all others in Government, and may well be a pattern for direction and imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to any people in the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Venice</hi> thus gradually aſcending to emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency, grew ſo great as to challenge the ſuperiority over all the watry Element a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it; as well it might, being ſituate therein, and therefore <hi>Neptunes</hi> Minion. This City being on one ſide of <hi>Italy,</hi> on the other ſide lay <hi>Genoa,</hi> ſituate neer the feet of the <hi>Apennine Hills;</hi> a Commonwealth too, and therefore aſpiring high, grew e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulous of the Venetians greatneſs, which made thoſe two Republikes grow at enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The firſt occaſion of their falling out, was about a Church allowed them both, for exerciſe of Divine Service, in <hi>Ptolemais,</hi> commonly called <hi>Acoe</hi> in <hi>Syria:</hi> this Church being too little to hold both peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of ſuch great ſpirits, there grew a hot Diſpute whoſe it ſhould be; which came
<pb facs="tcp:54215:111"/>
to this iſſue, That it muſt be theirs that could get poſſeſſion; which prov'd to be the Genoeſes, who to maintain their <hi>Maſs,</hi> armed the Church with Fortifications (not for example to after-Ages) and ſo kept it wholly to their own Uſe: Thus began the Quarrel, which continued for many years, chiefly by Sea, till at laſt the Genoeſes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſuch dangerous ſhot betwixt winde and water, that they were fain to cry Quarter, and ever ſince vail to <hi>Venice,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging it their ſuperiour.</p>
               <p>Even ſo was it between theſe two migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Republikes, <hi>England</hi> and the United Provinces. The Dutch fearing that cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of Traffick would be ſtopped which they had ſo long enjoyed, by reaſon of <hi>Englands.</hi> Domeſtick and Forreign Wars, themſelves, mean while, having Peace with all Nations (except <hi>Portugal)</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they increaſing their Trade by an un-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted fiſhing in the Britiſh Seas, and ſtill greedy in their unſatiable appetite of ingroſſing all to themſelves, without either Right or Reaſon; grew at laſt highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited of their own abilities, both as to Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Power. Their Policy was ſeen in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving aſſiſtance to the Enemies of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
<pb facs="tcp:54215:112"/>
Parliament, whilſt in the mean time, their Embaſſadors tickled the Council of State and Parliament into a belief of their Maſters real affections and hearty wiſhes for their proſperity. But theſe unworthy actions being privately ſuſpected, it was not long before they were publikely detected: This put the Dutch to their <hi>Trumps,</hi> and made them arm out a conſiderable Navy, to execute a deſigne upon the Iſle of <hi>Scilly,</hi> which then was in poſſeſſion of the Scotch Kings Forces. But the Council of State in <hi>England</hi> having timely notice of this project, diſpatched away <hi>Blake</hi> (their noble General by ſea) with a Fleet of Men of War, who being joyned with <hi>Sir George Aſcue,</hi> immediately prevented the Dutch, by reducing that Iſland under obedience.</p>
               <p>The Parliament of <hi>England</hi> having ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly conſidered the unhandſome acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of theſe their neer Neighbours, how refractory they were upon all Treaties of Amity, which was ſeen by their refuſing thoſe Propoſitions which were ſent to them; and how thoſe honourable Perſons that carried them to <hi>Holland,</hi> were dayly ſo ill treated at the <hi>Hague</hi> by ſome inſolent
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:54215:112"/>
perſons, that the Parliament, leſt their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors ſhould again be <hi>Doriſlaus'd,</hi> call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them home <hi>Reinfecta:</hi> Preſently upon this, they were forc'd to take up a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to maintain the Right of their Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction on the Britiſh Seas, and therefore ſent abroad an Act for incouraging Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and increaſe of ſhipping. This ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much heightned the ſpirits of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Sea-men, and gave them hopes of being one day even with the Dutch, for eating the bread out of their mouthes, as they had long before done, by bringing all Commodities into <hi>England,</hi> at cheaper rates then they could be ſent for, by reaſon they were in Amity with moſt Nations, and could ſend out ſhips with no more men then what ſerved to ſail them; whilſt in the mean time, the Engliſh (having Wars with moſt of their Neighbours) were inforc't to be at great charges in double manning out their Merchant Men, for ſecurity of the ſhips lading. But to proceed.</p>
               <p>This noble <hi>Act</hi> being arrived at <hi>Holland,</hi> very ſtrangely changed the conſtitution of that People, from a Flegmatick to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Sanguine Complection: for now they ſaw it was time to look about them,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:54215:113"/>
being like to be deprived of that ſweet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit which before they did enjoy: This ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated them on to try concluſions, in deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Engliſh their undoubted Right of Dominion in the Britiſh ſeas. At firſt, it was put in practiſe by ſome particular men of War, to ſee if the Engliſh would relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh that old complement of ſtriking the Top-ſail: but in this they met with ſharp rebukes, far ſurpaſſing imagination, ſo that many times preſent Ruine did befal them, that in wilful refuſal durſt deny this ancient Cuſtom.</p>
               <p>Thus by degrees one Quarrel begetting another, the fire no longer ſmothered, but broak forth into a dreadful combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; all preceding ages ſince the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, never having produced ſuch terrible Sea-fights, which ever light heavy on the Dutch ſhoulders, and made them know, That although <hi>Holland</hi> was the elder <hi>State,</hi> yet was it impoſſible for them to make <hi>England</hi> a younger <hi>Brother.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in the midſt of all theſe high under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, the Lord General perceiving the Parliaments intentions were to perpetuate their ſitting, as appeared by their delatory
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:54215:113"/>
proceeding in the Bill for ſucceſſive Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives; therefore knowing, that as ſtanding water would breed corruption, and grow offenſive, if it were not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times changed: ſo Parliaments perpetual were offenſive to the Peoples Priviledges; but when <hi>pro tempore,</hi> pleaſant to their ſight. He having well weighed the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and deliberately debated the buſineſs with his Council of Officers, it was at laſt agreed by them to ſerve the Parliament with a Writ of Eaſe, and make them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the meaning of <hi>Exit</hi>—This reſolution being taken up, the Lord Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Cromwel</hi> went into the Houſe, attended by ſome of the prime Officers of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, where he delivered certain Reaſons for a preſent Diſſolution of the Parliament: which were no ſooner heard, but all the Members in obedience avoyded the place, and every one betook himſelf to his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular habitation.</p>
               <p>Thus this mighty Parliament was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, who firſt of all were called through the importunity of the people, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards upheld by the zealous devotion of the City of <hi>London,</hi> whoſe inhabitants, through their abundant affections, made
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:54215:114"/>
them a free-will offering of all their Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, Bodkins, Thimbles, and Jewels, to carry on the weighty great work of rout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Popery, beating down of Antichriſt, ſuppreſſing Superſtition; and out of all, to raiſe up a Glorious Structure of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>To anſwer expectations, this Senate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan the work with the Kings evil Council, and having lopped them off, drove on to ſuch great Actions, that the faith of after-Ages will be much puzzled to believe, and rather look upon them as Romances then Realities. But now their time being come, after twelve years ſitting, they were anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilated, and the power transferred into the hands of others.</p>
               <p>Preſently upon this, the Lord General <hi>Cromwel</hi> and his Council of Officers pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed a Declaration, ſhewing the Reaſons of the Parliaments Diſſolution; the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance whereof, was this:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>THat after God was pleaſed marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly to appear for his People, in reducing</hi> Ireland <hi>and</hi> Scotland <hi>to ſo great a degree of Peace, and</hi> England
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:54215:114"/>
                  <hi>to perfect quiet; whereby the Parliament had opportunity to give the People the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt of all their Labour, Blood and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; and to ſettle a due Liberty in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to Civil and Spiritual things: whereunto they were obliged by their duty, engagements, and thoſe great and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful things God hath wrought for them. But they made ſo little progreſs therein, that it was matter of much grief to the good people of the Land; who there upon applyed themſelves to the Army, expecting redreſs by their means, who (though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to meddle with the Civil Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) agreed that ſuch Officers as were Members of Parliament ſhould move them to proceed vigorouſly, in reforming what was amiſs in the Commonwealth, and in ſetling it upon a foundation of Juſtice and Righteouſneſs: which being done, it was hoped the Parliament would have anſwered their expectations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But finding the contrary, they renewed their deſires by an humble Petition in</hi> Auguſt, 1652. <hi>which produced no conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:54215:115"/>
effect, nor was any ſuch progreſs made therein, as might imply their real in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tentions to accompliſh what was petitioned for; but rather an averſneſs to the things themſelves, with much bitterneſs and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the People of God and his Spirit acting in them: inſomuch that the Godly Party in Parliament were rendered of no further uſe, then to countenance the ends of a corrupt Party, for effecting their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of perpetuating themſelves in the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Government.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For obviating theſe evils, the Officers of the Army obtained ſeveral meetings with ſome of the Parliament, to conſider what Remedy might be applyed to prevent the ſame; but ſuch endeavours proving ineffectual, it became evident, that this Parliament, through the corruption of ſome, the jealouſie of others, the non-at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance of many, would never anſwer thoſe ends which God, his People, and the whole Nation expected from them; But that this Cauſe which God had ſo greatly bleſſed, muſt needs languiſh under their
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:54215:115"/>
hands, and by degrees be loſt; and the Lives, Liberties and Comforts of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple be delivered into their enemies hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>All which being ſadly and ſeriouſly conſidered by the honeſt people of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as well as by the Army, it ſeemed a Duty incumbent upon us, who had ſeen ſo much of the power and preſence of God, to conſider of ſome effectual means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to eſtabliſh Righteouſneſs and Peace in theſe Nations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And after much debate, it was judged neceſſary, that the Supreme Government ſhould be by the Parliament devolved up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on known perſons, fearing God, and of approved integrity for a time, as the most hopeful way to countenance all Gods people, reform the Law, and adminiſter Juſtice impartially: hoping thereby the people might forget Monarchy, and underſtand their true intereſt in the Election of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsive Parliaments; that ſo the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might be ſettled upon a right Baſis, without hazard to this glorious Cauſe, or neceſsitating to keep up Armies for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the ſame.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:54215:116"/>
                  <hi>And being ſtill reſolved to uſe all means poſsibly to avoid extraordinary courſes we prevailed with about twenty Members of Parliament, to give us a conference, with whom we plainly debated the neceſsity and juſtneſs of our Propoſals: The which found no acceptance, but inſtead thereof it was offered, That the way was, to continue ſtill this Parliament, as being that from which we might probably expect all good things. This being vehemently inſiſted on, did much confirm us in our apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, That not any love to a Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, but the making uſe thereof to recruit, and ſo to perpetuate themſelves, was their aim, in the Act they had then under conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For preventing the conſummating whereof, and all the ſad and evil conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, which upon the grounds afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid muſt have enſued, and whereby at one blow the intereſt of all honeſt men, and of this glorious Cauſe had been endanger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be laid in the duſt, and theſe Nations embroyled in new troubles, at a time when
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:54215:116"/>
our Enemies abroad are watching all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages againſt, and ſome of them actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally engaged in War with us; we have been neceſsitated (though with much relu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctancy) to put an end to this Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Declaration being ſent abroad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all the Dominions of the Common-wealth, was readily aſſented to by moſt of the chief Officers, both by Land and Sea. But for farther ſatisfaction to the Civil Power in the Nation, whereby a right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding might be had, and that every one might ſtill (notwithſtanding this ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den change) obſerve his Duty, the former Declaration was ſeconded by this enſuing.</p>

               <p>The like was ſeen amongſt the Naval Forces at Sea, whoſe vivacity was now as great as ever, both Officers, Sea-men, and Souldiers, minding nothing more then how to gain honour to their Country, by repreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the inſolencies of their Enemies, whoſe indeavours at this time were to rob <hi>England</hi> of her Right.</p>
               <p>But now the Lord General having taken upon himſelf to weild both the Sword and the Scepter, the firſt remarkable paſſage that befel him, was at Sea, between the two mighty Antagoniſts. The Dutch ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ready in their Harbours a very great Fleet of Merchant men, outward bound, for <hi>France, Spain,</hi> and other Ports, all things being fitted and prepared for the Sea, thoſe
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:54215:118"/>
High and Mighty States added ninety men of War to ſecure them from thoſe dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Fellows, the Engliſh. This Fleet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all ready, they hoiſt up ſail, bidding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main for the North of <hi>Scotland;</hi> it ſeems rather chuſing to make a long and ſure Voyage that way, then a ſhort and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous one through St. <hi>George</hi> his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, which had many times proved fatal to their Fleets, notwith ſtanding the protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their beſt Commanders. <hi>Trump</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving according to his Commiſſion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted his charge ſo far, that they feared no other enemy then the winds and waves, immediately tacked about for the <hi>Sound,</hi> from whence he brought away a great Fleet of <hi>Eaſt-Land</hi> Merchant-men, from <hi>Ruſſia, Denmark, Dantzicks</hi> and other Parts; to which was joyned a Fleet from <hi>France,</hi> laden with Wine, Salt, and other Commodities of that Country: having in ſafety brought all theſe home, he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Ports of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand</hi> with ſo much Bravery, and ſo great a Flouriſh, that thoſe perſons that knew not the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, might have thought him dragging the Engliſh Generals at the Stern of his Ship, in Triumph.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="229" facs="tcp:54215:118"/>
This good Fortune being ſeconded with a report of the Engliſh Fleet being gone Northward under the Command of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Monk</hi> and <hi>Dean,</hi> ſo highly animated <hi>Minhere Martin Harper,</hi> that with all his Men of War he preſently ſet ſail for the <hi>Downs,</hi> to act that in the abſence of the Engliſh Fleet, which he durſt not do in their preſence.</p>
               <p>Being come into the <hi>Downs, May</hi> 25. the Dutch Fleet, conſiſting of 108 Ships, ranged themſelves before <hi>Dover,</hi> where they expreſſed a great deal of ſmall valour, in beating down with great ſhot the chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of that Town; and with ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution and ſpirit did they perform this worthy exploit, that not any of their ſhips offered to run away, all the while. This Action of <hi>Trump's</hi> was looked upon by all, to ſavour more of Arrogance then Valour: for a gallant ſouldier will ſcorn to meddle with him that is incapable of defence, but rather meaſure weapons with his Enemy before the fight; neither ſhould a General content himſelf with making a few Tiles fly from the tops of Houſes, in a poor Town; which can be but ſmall credit to himſelf, and not much damage to his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:54215:119"/>
But we ſhall ſee that <hi>Van Trump</hi> will meet with ſuch a match as will give him opportunity enough to exerciſe his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to the utmoſt: for the two Generals <hi>Monk</hi> and <hi>Dean,</hi> upon the ſudden return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the North into <hi>Yarmouth-</hi>Road, where they joyned with that Fortreſs of his Country, General <hi>Blake,</hi> having 18 ſhips more: Theſe on the 3 of <hi>June</hi> 1653. lying at Anchor three leagues off the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of the <hi>Gober,</hi> early in the morning deſcribed two Dutch Galliots, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently were chaſed by ſome of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Frigats ſo far, that they came within ken of the whole Dutch Fleet. Upon this diſcovery, the Frigots made the uſual ſignes, which were preſently apprehended by the whole Fleet, who immediately weighing their Anchors, the Engliſh made up with all the ſail they could: but the winde being weak, 'twas 12 at noon before theſe mighty Armadoes could ingage.</p>
               <p>The firſt dayes work proved hot on both ſides, for three hours; in which Diſpute the Engliſh loſt General <hi>Dean,</hi> who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately fell by a great ſhot. To ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance this, the Dutch had three ſhips ſunk, and one blown up.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="231" facs="tcp:54215:119"/>
The next day, both Fleets indeavoured to try another bout, but there being little winde nor wine ſtirring, but <hi>Brandy,</hi> which was very brisk in the Dutch Fleet, it was late that day before the Engliſh could get up to give them Gun-powder to it. This ſecond dayes fight was managed with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of valour, both Fleets charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing luſtily upon one another. <hi>Van Trump</hi> to ſhew his skill in Sea-fights, at firſt brought up his Navy in very good Order, having the advantage of that little winde then ſtirring (for the Sea looked with a ſmooth face upon theſe mighty Enemies) But the Engliſh Generals, <hi>Blake</hi> and <hi>Monk,</hi> who were not behinde-hand in making uſe of any opportunity, finding the winde upon the ſudden to veer about weſterly, drove in amongſt the thickeſt of their Enemies, with ſo much fury, that the Dutch fearing to feed thoſe that had ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times been food to them, tacked about, and with all the ſail that poſſibly could be made, ſteered their courſe for their own Coaſts. The Engliſh ſeeing their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies thus fly before them, thought it not ſafe to purſue, being neer the Flats, and having great ſhips that drew much water.
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:54215:120"/>
Wherefore ſome ſmall Frigats being ſent to diſcover the Enemies courſe, the reſt caſt Anchor in good Order, to caſt up ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts, and ſee what was got or loſt by this Adventure; which proved in full, to be thus:

               <p>This inconſiderable loſs on the Engliſh ſide being well recompenſed with ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable a Damage to the Dutch, cauſed the two Engliſh Generals (being no wayes diſ-inabled by the fight) to keep the Sea, and reſolve to follow the preſent advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the full; therefore having new trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med their torn ſails, and ſhatter'd Rigging, they immediately made all the haſte that could be, to block up the Dutch Harbours; letting <hi>Trump</hi> ſee that now his Bravadoes
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:54215:120"/>
were transferred from the <hi>Downs,</hi> to his own Doors, and that the Fleet which a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before he thought good to ſend Hue and Cry after, were now come to dare him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his own Dunghil the Engliſh at Sea, lying thus before the <hi>Texel, Wielings,</hi> and other Ports of <hi>Holland,</hi> taking Prizes at pleaſure.</p>
               <p>General <hi>Cromwel</hi> at Land (mean while) prepares for a new Parliament, in whoſe hands the Legiſlative Power of the Nation was to be put: to that purpoſe, perſons being choſen by himſelf, to the number of one hundred forty four, out of the three Nations of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> they made their appearance at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> on <hi>July</hi> 4. 1653. (the day prefixt in their Summons) in the Council-Chamber at <hi>White-hall,</hi> where General <hi>Cromwel</hi> being preſent, attended by many Officers of the Army, he made a ſhort Speech; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ended, by a Writing under his own hand and ſeal, he impowered them to be the Supreme Authority and Governours of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> with all the Territories thereunto belonging: and that any forty of them ſhould be a <hi>Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> ſufficient to diſpatch buſineſs, make
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:54215:121"/>
Laws, and order all things as they ſhould ſee good; onely for their limitation, the Inſtrument ordered their ſitting not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the third of <hi>November,</hi> 1654. and that three months before their Diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they were to make choice of other perſons, to whom they were to deliver up their Powers. Having delivered his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument to the Members, the Lord Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral diſmiſt them with a Benediction (being very good at it) wiſhing the Bleſſing of GOD might go along with them and their Counſels. Immediately hereupon, the Members adjourned to the old Parliament Houſe, where having firſt appointed Mr. <hi>Rouſe</hi> to be Speaker, a great debate aroſe among them what to call themſelves, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Parliament, or ſomething elſe: at laſt it was carried in the affirmative, That they were a Parliament; in which name, all Addreſſes to them were to be made.</p>
               <p>Being thus ſettled, they began (though ſcarce pen feathered) to ſoar high, and at firſt daſh to ſtrike both at Law and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.</p>
               <p>But whilſt theſe things were under de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate. <hi>John Liburn,</hi> whoſe turbulent Spirit in the time of the Long Parliament, had
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:54215:121"/>
procured his Baniſhment, preſuming at this time to be again admitted into the Nation, very confidently addreſt himſelf to the Lord General, craving his Protection. But he knowing full well of what ſpirit <hi>John</hi> was, would take no notice of him, but left him to the Law, by which he underwent a ſtrict Trial, and by the favour of his Jury was acquitted.</p>
               <p>This man was ever obſerved to be of an ambitious minde, alwayes affecting Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity, and therefore ever barking againſt the Higher Powers; firſt againſt the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, then againſt the King: next, againſt the Parliament; and indeed, againſt every one that ſtood in his way. Likewiſe ſo fickle in his own Principles, that trundling from one Opinion to another, he at laſt fell down into the ſink of Quakeriſme, in which he died, and was buried like himſelf, being hurried along the ſtreets, from the Mouth neer <hi>Alderſgate,</hi> by a confuſed med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of Levellers and Quakers. But to Sea again.</p>
               <p>The Engliſh Fleet having out-Trumped the Dutch, and made their <hi>Neptune</hi> fly to Land for ſhelter, they improved their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the utmoſt, by blocking up the
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:54215:122"/>
Ports of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand,</hi> ſo that not a ſhip durſt paſs in or out, but was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately made Prize. Among thoſe that were taken, were two laden with great Guns, one carrying one hundred ſixty two, the other, one hundred ninety one.</p>
               <p>Theſe dayly loſſes filled the people with rage and madneſs, ſeeing they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of Traffick, by which they chiefly ſubſiſted; and if that was obſtructed, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a deep conſumption would quickly follow. The States General ſitting at the Helm, and foreſeeing the ſad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of the preſent War, ſeriouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated which way to free themſelves from that imminent danger that now hung over their heads. To accompliſh this, there was but two wayes; either by Force to repel Force, or by Treaty to procure Peace. To put both theſe in execution, four Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners were diſpatched away imediately for <hi>London,</hi> to treat of a Reconciliation; and in the mean time, all imaginable preparations were made to proſecute the War, that ſo peace might be obtained on better Terms.</p>
               <p>Whilſt they are thus providing to run the hazard of one blow more, it will not
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:54215:122"/>
be much amiſs to give a rough draught of Naval Combats. An ancient Philoſopher laughed heartily at the folly of thoſe that durſt be ſo bold to venter themſelves at Sea, within two inches of death, for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit. If to ſail in a ſhip ſo much deſerves laughing at, what folly then (nay madneſs) is it to fight, when all the Elements conſpire to make an end of the Combatants? For, the Timber, which is the material ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of a Ship, may be accompted Earth, out of which it is produced, and eaſily giveth way to penetration by the impartial Bullet, which ſeldom hits the Hull without Execution, making thoſe Planks fly into ſplinters, and become the inſtruments of death, which before were looked upon as a defence and ſafe-guard from the Enemies ſhot. The infinite number of great Guns belching forth fire and ſmoak, ſo that the ſuperficies of the water ſeemeth to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate with its contrary Element: whilſt the ſerenity of the Air is obfuſcated by Clouds of Smoak; the Combatants, mean while, eagre to grapple with each other, are loſt in a fog: In one place is to be ſeen a ſhip converted into a Bon-fire; and her men fearful to fry, fling themſelves
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:54215:123"/>
voluntarily into a cooler kinde of death: In another place is a Veſſel depopulated of all her Inhabitants, without Maſts, Yards, Tackle, or any other thing that is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for her guide; and thus ſhe floats a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout in a deſperate condition. Here are men wanting ſhips, and there are ſhips wanting men: and nothing is more ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then how to alter the natural verdure of the Sea, with the ſanguine, Purple of humane ſlaughter. Thus Confuſion rides in Triumph; and death at one inſtant ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in various ſhapes: a neglected match, or accidental ſpark, being got into the Powder, in a trice conquers the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors, and makes them fly, who before were purſuers. The water, as that bears the Berthen, ſo it claims a great ſhare in deſtroying: for at the redoubling ſound of the thundring ſhot, the Billows being backt with a puff of winde, dance a Currant to this doleful muſick, and readily attend the deſtruction of thoſe Veſſels that are bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd betwixt winde and water.</p>
               <p>This being the Theotick of Sea-ſervice, let us now ſee the Practick, as it was acted by the two mighty Antagoniſts.</p>
               <p>The two Generals; <hi>Blake</hi> and <hi>Monk,</hi>
                  <pb n="239" facs="tcp:54215:123"/>
with the Engliſh Fleet, had now danced attendance at the Dutch doors, for two months together, in all which time, <hi>Van Trump</hi> was preparing the utmoſt ſtrength that poſſibly could be made, by the inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigable induſtry of the States General. Their Navy being new rigged and tallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was ſet afloat, conſiſting of 120 ſail of Men of War. The moſt of theſe lay at the <hi>Wielings,</hi> the reſt in the <hi>Texel.</hi> And now to incourage and raiſe up the reſolution of the Sea-men, that ſo they might atchieve mighty matters, a Proclamation is made, that all the ſhipping they could take from the Engliſh, being Men of War, ſhould be their own; beſides ſome thouſands of Gilders to thoſe that durſt take the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Admiral, and a proportionable ſum for him that could take the Vice-Admiral or his Flag: theſe promiſes, with an addition of Brandy-wine, tipt the Dutch mens tongues with valour. <hi>Van Trump</hi> having now all things in readineſs, ſet ſail in hopes to return a compleat Victor, thereby to wipe off the ſtain which formerly had been flung upon his reputation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>July</hi> 29. 1653. the Engliſh Scouts diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered 95 Men of War to come bravely
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:54215:124"/>
ſailing from the <hi>Wielings:</hi> they ſoon knew them to be Enemies, and therefore gave notice, that the whole Fleet (which then lay about three leagues off to Sea) might make up: but the winde facing the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, kept them from the Engagement, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til ſix a clock in the evening; when about thirty nimble Frigats (the reſt being ſtill at Stern) began the encounter, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued until night parted them.</p>
               <p>This firſt dayes fight did onely whet their appetites to the enſuing ſlaughter; for all this night the Durch bore away to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Texel,</hi> where joyned with them, 25 ſail of ſtout men of War: theſe were the prime ſhips of their Navy, wherein they chiefly relied. Their Fleet being thus re-inforced by this conjunction, <hi>Van Trump</hi> immediately endeavoured to put all in a fighting poſture, to engage: the next day: but the night proving foul, the wind in a rough note threatned the poor Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh with deſtruction, either on the Flats, or elſe on a Lee-ſhoar. To prevent theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſters, <hi>Monk,</hi> with the Engliſh Fleet, ſet ſail, and ſtood out to ſea: this ſight made the Dutch to ſuppoſe a flight, inſomuch that one of their Captains deſired <hi>Van
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:54215:124"/>
Van Trump</hi> to purſue: <hi>For</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>theſe Schellums dare not ſtand one Broad Side from your Excellency; you may ſee them plainly running home, and therefore my Lord miſs not the opportunity.</hi> This was not the firſt time that <hi>Trump</hi> had ſeen the <hi>Engliſh</hi> at Sea, and therefore returned the Captain this ſhort Anſwer: <hi>Sir, look to your Charge, for were the Enemy but twenty Sail, they would never refuſe to fight us.</hi> So it fell out: for the weather proving fair and calm, the Engliſh contracted their Fleet together, and in a Body tack'd about to meet the Enemy. Neither was <hi>Trump</hi> behindhand to meet his reſolute Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; but with as much ſpeed as care he brought his Navy into ſuch a form, as ſufficiently manifeſted the excellent skill he had in managing Maritime Affairs. The Morning to this fatal day proved ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what gloomy, ſo that it ſeemed the Sun was aſhamed to behold the enſuing ſlaughters. About five a Clock in the morning, the Dutch having the Weathergage, began the ſight ſomewhat at a diſtance; but it was not long<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> before both Fleets were deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately engaged board and board. Now, (as a modern Poet expreſſeth it)
<q>
                     <pb n="242" facs="tcp:54215:125"/>
                     <l>The Slaughter-breathing-<hi>Braſs</hi> grew hot, and ſpoke</l>
                     <l>In Flames of <hi>Lightning,</hi> and in Clouds of <hi>Smoke,</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>Till the diſcolour'd <hi>Billowes</hi> dide in Grain,</l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Bluſht</hi> to behold ſuch Shambles of the Slain.</l>

               </p>
               <p>Never was fight upon the Sea better managed and maintained, then this. The <hi>Andrew</hi> (which deſerved Saintſhip for the ſervice) luft aboard <hi>Trumps</hi> own Ship, but was quickly haled off by a Fire-ſhip which ſtuck like a Plaiſter to her ſide, ſo that in a trice the Tackle blazed like a Torch; and had it not been for the wonderful courage of ſome few Sea-men, ſhe had then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly periſhed. The like diſaſter fell upon the <hi>Triumph</hi> a ſecond-rate Ship, which ſometimes encountred many at once, but ſtill triumphed over all, till at laſt a great <hi>Flemiſh</hi> Ship ſet her on fire; which began to rage in ſuch a terrible manner, that it wrought the greateſt confuſion ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable in the diſtracted Company; ſome of them chuſing the Flood before the Flame,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:54215:125"/>
leaped over-board and were drowned. The example of thoſe few that ended their lives in this deſperate condition, made the reſt double their diligence, to ſave themſelves and Ship: which was at laſt performed; ſo that the medley growing great, and the fury of the Sailers and Souldiers having baniſh'd all fear, they boldly board one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. The <hi>Rainbow,</hi> an Engliſh Ship, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a long time ſtriven to make priſe of others, was at laſt like to be ſurpriſed her ſelf, had not the <hi>Oak</hi> ſeeing the danger of her fellow, bore in to the Reſcue: but this charitable deed reduced the <hi>Oak</hi> to Aſhes, ſhe being deſtroyed by a Fire-ſhip. Yet for all this, the Engliſh (no whit daunted) maintained the Fight with ſuch an obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Gallantry, that the Dutch, though high in reſolution, were low in hopes of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory. And well they might: for what can be expected, when men fight for fear of puniſhment, as here many did, not ſo much regarding the honour of Conqueſt, as the Eyes of the two Lords ſent on purpoſe in a nimble Frigat to obſerve every Captains Actions?</p>
               <p>This bloudy Battle now continued with eagerneſs (but more uncertainty) from five

in the morning till ten; about which time, <hi>Van Trump,</hi> fighting in the midſt of the Engliſh Fleet, had a Paſs-port ſent him for another world, being ſhot with a Muſquet-Bullet into the left Breaſt near the Heart. What can live, when the Heart is dead? <hi>Trump</hi> was the Life of the Action; by whoſe example all was guided and direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: no ſooner was his Life ſpent, but the Hearts of his men were broken: a general Conſternation ſuddenly poſſeſt the whole Fleet, ſo that the Sea-men had more minde to carry home the news of their renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Generals death, then to take venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on the Engliſh for killing him.</p>
               <p>This unfortunate ſhot made the Dutch (now the Head was loſt) for preſervation of the remaining part of the body, at firſt to diſengage themſelves, ſtill fighting in a defenſive poſture; and then about three a Clock in the evening, to clap on all the Canvas poſſible, and haſte to their own Ports. It had been happy if all could have made the like ſpeed; but that was forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by the Engliſh, who had ſunk and fired 27 of their Men of War, and killed them upwards of 2000 men, beſides ſix Captains and 1000 Priſoners taken: but the loſs
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:54215:126"/>
of loſſes was the General <hi>Van Trump;</hi> to conquer whom alone, had been a Victory ſufficient to deſerve a Triumph: hereby the States of <hi>Holland</hi> were deprived of as able a Sea-man as ever ſailed the Ocean: he was a man ſerious in deliberation; but when reſolved, truly valiant in Action; which was ſufficiently manifeſt in that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent ſervice he performed for the ſafety and honour of his Country againſt <hi>Don Antonio d'Oquendo,</hi> in the year 1639, when with a ſmall Fleet he fought the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards in the Downs, and without any great trouble brought that great <hi>Armada</hi> to nothing, wherein was imbarqued 23000<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Souldiers, beſides Mariners. This he did with ſo much generoſity, that when the Spaniſh General durſt not ſet to Sea from under the protection of <hi>Dover-caſtle,</hi> for want of Powder, <hi>Trump</hi> offered to ſupply him therewith, and afterwards to fight him. He was ever obſerved to be a zealous Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertor of the <hi>Orange</hi> Intereſt, both at home and abroad; this made him ſo eager to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and drive on the War between <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> becauſe the poſterity of King <hi>Charles</hi> (Father-in-law to the Prince of <hi>Orange)</hi> were excluded from Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:54215:127"/>
Some Obligations he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the ſaid King; as Knighthood at <hi>Dover, anno</hi> 1641. and gifts at the ſame time, which ſufficiently manifeſted the Bounty of the Donor. This is certain, that the fall of this great man did very much conduce to the future Peace between the two Republicks, which quickly after fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Trump</hi>'s death was not without loſs on the Engliſh ſide: for no leſs then ſix Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, with 400 Souldiers and Sea-men took leave of this, to bear him company into the other World: beſides theſe, there was wounded ſix Captains, and 700 of the inferiour ſort: but for ſhipping, the loſs was ſo ſmall, that it may cauſe wonder; for no more miſcarried then the <hi>Oak,</hi> a Ship of about 30 Guns, and a ſmall Fire-ſhip beſides: but yet the reſt of the Navy were ſo much wounded, that they made home to repair Breaches, and recruit for another Expedition. Thus the <hi>Engliſh Mastiff</hi> baited the <hi>Belgick Lyon,</hi> till ſhe made him run roaring home for ſhelter.</p>
               <p>Whilſt theſe Succeſſes were given a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, diſcontent rages at home among the
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:54215:127"/>
moſt ſober ſort of people, cauſed by the ſtrange Actings of the Parliament, who had now ſate ſix moneths, and hatched little more then the Act for Marriages; which was made, more to vex the Clergie, then pleaſe the Laity. This was but a branch of the Miniſters maintenance, the body being Tythes, was with might and main endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to be hewen down to the ground: but the event anſwered not the intent; for a Committee being purpoſely appointed to conſider of this weighty buſineſs, and make report to the Houſe; the Legality of it both by the Laws of God and man, was ſo largely and clearly proved before them, that after a full hearing, and ſerious conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the whole matter, the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee returned an Affirmative report for Tythes: but yet for all this, many of the Members being deſirous to lay open a gap for confuſion, did very ſtifly argue againſt the Miniſterial Function, making it little better then Antichriſtian, and Burdenſome to the people. Of this humour there were no fewer then 60 of the Members, and for the Miniſtry 84. theſe laſt were the Major part, which very wiſely (fearing the Minor would undermine them, by watching all
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:54215:128"/>
opportunities to accompliſh their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes) did reſolve to break-up houſe-kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping: which motion being made by a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Munday <hi>December</hi> 12. it was readily aſſented unto; ſo that the Speaker adjour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to <hi>White-hall,</hi> and delivered up the Powers they had received, to General <hi>Cromwel</hi> again.</p>
               <p>As the Magnitude of <hi>Hercules</hi> body was once drawn by the dimenſion of his foot; ſo the policy of <hi>Cromwel</hi> may be ſeen in the Actions of this pack'd Parliament; as may be perceived by a rational Anſwer to theſe following Queries:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Whether the Parliament did not make way for</hi> Cromwel'<hi>s future greatneſs, in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away the Engagement, under pretence of liberty for tender conſciences that ſcrupled the taking of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>When</hi> Cromwel <hi>earneſtly deſired the ſeveral Members of this Parliament to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member Tythes and the Univerſities, whether he meant the extirpation or confirmation of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Whether ſome of this Parliament-Members violent endeavours to level the Law in its practice, and the Goſpel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:54215:128"/>
preaching thereof, was not a deſigne of</hi> Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels, <hi>to render the Members odious to the vulgar, that ſo his own Government might be the more acceptable to the people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Whether it was an Act of Grace or Gratitude in the Parliament, to make</hi> Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel <hi>a Member of that which he had made a Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Whether the picking of this Parliament was intended more for publick good, or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate deſignes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lord General having now got the Civil and Military Powers into his Hands by this Reſignation, made uſe of them to his beſt advantage. Firſt of all, he called a Council of Officers; and joyning with them certain other perſons to adviſe, it was by them (not without abundant ſeeking of God, and ſpeaking from ſeveral places of Scripture which lay much upon the ſpirits of many in this Aſſembly) reſolved to have a <hi>Commonwealth in a Single Perſon;</hi> which perſon ſhould be the Lord General <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel,</hi> under the Title and Dignity of <hi>Lord Protector of</hi> England, Scotland <hi>and</hi> Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>and the Dominions and Territories thereunto belonging.</hi> To him was aſſigned
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:54215:129"/>
a Council conſiſting of One and twenty, to be aſſiſtants in the Government. But becauſe there can be no Superſtructure without a Baſis, an <hi>Inſtrument</hi> was framed, to be the Foundation of this preſent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: which chiefly was made up of theſe following Heads.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Protector ſhould call a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament every three years.</hi>
               </p>

               <p n="9">9. <hi>That in the Intervals of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he and his Council might make Laws that ſhould be binding to the Subject,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But now to make theſe things binding to the Conſcience of this Grand Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, <hi>December</hi> 16. 1653. he in great ſtate went from <hi>White-hall</hi> to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> where in the Chancery Court, before the Judges, Maior and Aldermen of <hi>London,</hi> with the chiefeſt Officers of the Nation, he did ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly ſwear, <hi>To accept of the Government; and promiſed in the preſence of God, not to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olate or infringe the matters and things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Inſtrument, but to obſerve, and cauſe the ſame to be obſerved; and in all things to the best of his underſtanding, govern the Nations according to the Laws, Statutes and Cuſtoms; ſeek their peace, cauſing Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice and Law to be equally adminiſtred.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Oath being publickly known, the Ceremony concluded with great. Acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of certain Souldiers. Preſently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, this following Proclamation by the
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:54215:130"/>
Council was publiſhed through <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>WHereas the late Parliament diſſolved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and reſigning their Powers and Authorities, the Government of the Common-wealth of</hi> England, Scotland <hi>and</hi> Ireland, <hi>by a Lord Protector, and ſucceſſive triennial Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aments is now eſtabliſhed: And whereas</hi> Oliver Cromwel <hi>Captain-General of all the Forces of this Commonwealth is declared Lord Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of the ſaid Nations, and hath accepted thereof: We have therefore thought it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry (as we hereby do) to make Publication of the Premiſes, and ſtrictly to charge and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand all and every Perſon and Perſons, of what quality and condition ſoever in any of the ſaid three Nations, to take notice hereof, and to conform and ſubmit themſelves to the Government ſo eſtabliſhed. And all Sheriffs, Maiors, Bailiffs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>are required to publiſh this Proclamation, to the end none may have cauſe to pretend ignorance in this behalf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nothing could ſatisfie <hi>Caeſars</hi> Ambition, but a perpetual Dictatorſhip; nor <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>'s, but to have more worlds to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer; and why then ſhould our <hi>Cromwel,</hi>
                  <pb n="253" facs="tcp:54215:130"/>
having the ſame aſpiration, (and inſpiration above them) be ſatisfied with leſs then a perpetual Protectorſhip? Ambition is of ſuch a Nature, that to be firſt in a Village, pleaſes better then the ſecond place in a City; but to ſatisfie an ambitious Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite ſufficiently with honour, is impoſſible; unleſs he can clime ſo high, that none dares ask how he came to that height.</p>
               <p>To this Elevation is the Subject of our Diſcourſe come, that his thoughts can riſe no higher, then how to keep in Peace what he hath got by Policy. The City of <hi>London</hi> (as there can be no great change without its Concurrence) preſently invites the Protector to a great Feaſt at <hi>Grocers-Hall,</hi> where his Entertainment was more ſuitable to the former Splendor, then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Exigence of that once-flouriſhing City. Immediately after, ſome Paper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kites flew out of the Country to Court from particular perſons, making Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Congratulation and real Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: Theſe bore in the Front the Title of <hi>Addreſſes</hi> from all the good people in the Nation; when it was well known, that thoſe whoſe Blood had purchas'd them Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty from under one Perſon, would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:54215:131"/>
ſubſcribe themſelves <hi>Slaves</hi> to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>The Protector began his Reign with ſeeming Serenity, inſomuch that many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected <hi>Halcyon</hi> days; ſuch Sanctity ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the Countenance of this Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: his Tongue on all occaſions was tipt with Lamentations at the Effuſion of Chriſtian Blood, and cuſtomarily would bemoan the <hi>Animoſities</hi> amongſt the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, cauſed by diverſity in Religion: Yet for all that, when any Overtures were made to him tending to a Settlement and Conformity in Religion, then, <hi>his power was no greater in the Nation then a Constable's, who is to keep peace and quietneſs amongſt all parties.</hi> Thus he behaved himſelf towards the Eccleſiaſticks.</p>
               <p>But now we come to his firſt grand A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of State, the Negotiation of the Dutch Peace. This War had been gallant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maintained by the long Parliament, who in many Fights filled our Harbours with Prizes, which weakened much the united Provinces; but every bout augmented the Valour and Reſolution of the Engliſh Sea-men: ſo that in a little while, the dread
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:54215:131"/>
of this Adverſary was turned into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</p>
               <p>I will not yet in the leaſt derogate from the worth of this brave Enemy: for in all Encounters, their endeavours were good; &amp; might have been better, if Sobriety among the Sea-men had been well obſerved; but 'tis ſad fighting, when the Can charged with <hi>Brandy,</hi> muſt be a Gun to conquer an Enemy: theſe weapons uſually conquered themſelves, and made way to their own deſtruction. But now to ſhew in part the Dutch Ingratitude, it will not be much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs to remember what <hi>England</hi> hath done for them.</p>
               <p>Time was, when the <hi>(High and Mighty)</hi> States of <hi>Holland,</hi> not able to help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, implored (as <hi>poor</hi> and <hi>diſtreſſed)</hi> Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> aſſiſtance: ſhe readily condeſcending, ſent them over a well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furniſhed Army commanded by the Earl of <hi>Leicester.</hi> Theſe were but the forlorn to greater Bodies, which after were tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported under the Conduct of thoſe brave Commanders, <hi>Norris, Vere, Sidney,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more, whoſe blood laid the Foundation of that Commonwealth: Theſe were the Men that cut the Spaniſh Yoak from off
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:54215:132"/>
their Necks, and never offered to ſheath their Swords, until the Dutch were fully poſſeſt of their Liberties. But O Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this was no ſooner done, but the Deed forgotten: For in King <hi>James</hi> his time, many Depredations were ſecretly committed on the Engliſh by them: It may ſuffiice if we mention no more but onely the buſineſs of <hi>Amboyna,</hi> which ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently witneſſeth how far their Will would have extended, had they had power ſufficient to execute it. Afterwards, King <hi>Charles</hi> perceiving their enchroaching, ſet forth a brave Fleet, (which hurt himſelf more then any body elſe; for it raiſed ſo hideous a ſtorm amongſt his Subjects upon the payment of Ship-money, that never af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter could be appeaſed, till his Head was blown off his Shoulders) theſe lying in the <hi>Downes</hi> under command of <hi>Dover-caſtle,</hi> to protect a <hi>Spaniſh Armado</hi> intending for <hi>Flanders,</hi> the Spaniards were boldly ſet upon by the Dutch, and utterly deſtroyed. Had this preſumptuous attempt of the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander</hi> met with a vindictive King, it would not have been ſo ſilently connived at. Theſe Affronts being thus ſlightly paſſed by, imboldened them to attempt higher
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:54215:132"/>
matters: for the Engliſh Nation on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain involved in a Domeſtick War, they made uſe of this opportunity to fiſh freely on the Engliſh Coaſt; which they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſo long, that from cuſtome, they would argue a right; becauſe they had done it, therefore they ought to do it ſtill: preſuming withall, to make <hi>Englands</hi> Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors the bounds to their Soveraignty. A rich Bank of Treaſure, and great ſtrength in ſhipping, prompted them to this project; and the rather, becauſe <hi>England</hi> was waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by War, and diſunited amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: Now they thought it their time to attempt the deſigne, wherein they fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied an aſſured and abſolute Conqueſt; not at all conſidering what advantages in Navigation <hi>England</hi> hath over them; as firſt, not a ſhip can well paſs the Narrow Seas between <hi>Dover</hi> and <hi>Calice,</hi> but muſt run the hazard to be ſnapt in their paſſage, unleſs they ſailed under protection of a ſtrong Fleet of War. Secondly, in ſtormy Weather the Winds would inforce ſhips at Sea to put into the Engliſh Harbours for ſhelter. In both which reſpects, it muſt needs be very prejudicial to the Dutch, if they fell out with <hi>England:</hi> their Traffick
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:54215:133"/>
this way being ſtopt up, no other means re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained to continue a Trade to <hi>France, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, East</hi> and <hi>West In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> but by the North of <hi>Scotland,</hi> with a Circumference about <hi>Ireland,</hi> whereby the Merchant muſt neceſſarily be expoſed to a double danger in reſpect of Enemies: And that which is more unavoydable, the tempeſtuouſneſs of the Sea in this Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly Latitude, would have rendred their paſſage that way both unfafe and uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable. But it ſeems theſe Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons never entred into the thoughts of that State; their minds were onely troubled with dividing Spoils, and how to give Laws by Sea to the whole world. This high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of Fortitude, many times bars up the doors againſt prudential Counſels. Well, blinded as the Dutch were, <hi>Van Trump,</hi> that <hi>leading Card</hi> againſt the Engliſh Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, muſt begin the Game, and that when their Embaſſadors were in Treaty at <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Parliament of <hi>England</hi> remembring their late ſaucy Action in the <hi>Downs,</hi> reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to make it redound to the honour of <hi>England:</hi> to that end, they fell into a cloſe debate of the Nations right in thoſe Seas:
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:54215:133"/>
now <hi>Mare Olauſum</hi> ſpeaks Engliſh, to let every one ſee the Dominion of the Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Sea is <hi>Englands</hi> ſafety and Protector, under Divine Providence, from the fury of forraign Foes, which if it were loſt, a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of all Nations would quickly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugate the Land to their will. How ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible the Senate and People of <hi>England</hi> were of this, is eaſily ſeen by the induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Counſels of the one, and incomparable Valour of the other; ſo that in a few moneths the Dutch ſuſtained more loſs by this their wilful undertaking, then before they had done in ſeveral years War with the <hi>Spaniard.</hi> The Engliſh Parliament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus engaged in a defenſive War, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly changed the Scoene to offenſive, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining it with wonderful Policy and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: but on a ſuddain, in ſtept General <hi>Cromwel,</hi> and juſtled them out of Power, taking upon himſelf to end this War. He fought the <hi>Hollander</hi> twice proſperouſly, which brought over into <hi>England</hi> four Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours extraordinary to ſollicite a Peace: theſe uſing pecuniary Perſwaſions, ſo far prevailed with the Protector, as made him balance the publick Concernments with his private Intereſt; and ſo granted their deſires.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="260" facs="tcp:54215:134"/>
The Peace being thus concluded, and publiſhed, the people of <hi>England</hi> were then perſwaded to a general Thankſgiving, by a Declaration, partly made up of nine Verſes out of the 107 <hi>Pſalm.</hi> To make obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on <hi>Englands</hi> Profit by this Peace, is needleſs; that I will leave for the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant to rejoyce in.</p>
               <p>Actions of State are like the Billows of the Sea, one deſigne drives forward ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as they are agitated by the Princes breath. No ſooner was peace proclaimed abroad, but Plots commenced at home: the chief Deſigners were two <hi>Gerrards,</hi> Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, one <hi>Jones</hi> an Apothecary, <hi>Teuder, Fow,</hi> and <hi>Vowel:</hi> ſome of theſe <hi>(through mercy)</hi> were ſaved, but <hi>Vowel</hi> and <hi>Gerrard</hi> muſt ſuffer for example.</p>
               <p>In the ſame Juncture of time fell out an arrogant exploit of <hi>Don Pantaleon Sa,</hi> brother to the <hi>Portugal Embaſſadour:</hi> this man being followed by a fanatique Crew, came one evening to the New Exhange armed with Swords, Piſtols, and Hand-gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadoes: what the original provocative to this deſigne was, is uncertain: however, one wrapt in Buff, (a bold Blade no doubt) being followed by Knights of <hi>Malta,</hi>
                  <pb n="261" facs="tcp:54215:134"/>
Foot-boys, and the like, aſcended the Stai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers into the upper Exchange, where firing a Piſtol, a Gentleman there walking, was ſlain. There happened to be walking the ſame time this <hi>Gerrard</hi> above-mentioned: he ſeeing their Countenances not ſo ſwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy as this deed was ſable, draws his Rapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and with a magnanimous ſpirit drove them all before him down ſtaiers. The Lord Protector having notice of theſe <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugals</hi> frollique, upon examination reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to proceed thereupon without reſpect of perſons, and to make the chiefeſt Actor an example of Juſtice; which being found to be the Embaſſadours Brother, he was condemned for this ridiculous riot, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted at <hi>Tower-hill</hi> on the ſame Scaffold (though for different cauſes) with <hi>generous Gerrard.</hi> The eyes of the Spectators never beheld ſuch different tempers in two men: <hi>Gerrard</hi> no way appald in countenance or behaviour, like a true Engliſh man, out-bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Death on the very Block. His body being removed out of ſight, up came <hi>Don Pontaleon Sa</hi> the Portugal, with a body too heavy for its ſupporters, and a countenance which ſufficiently demonſtrated, that the terrour of his heart had in a manner made

him inſenſible of the ſmart of the Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners Ax; ſo that many preſent believed his head ſerved onely to ſatisfie the Law, his life being already fled through fear.</p>
               <p>But now on a ſuddain there breaks forth an Inſurrection in the <hi>Highlands</hi> of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> theſe mountanous people having little to looſe but their lives, would ever be trying to ſhake the Engliſh yoak from off their necks. The chief bellows to blow theſe miſerable men to deſtruction, was the Earl of <hi>Glencarne,</hi> a man whoſe induſtry was ever pregnant in contriving new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes againſt the Engliſh: he having now drawn together a conſiderable ſtrength, proclaimed to his fellows what great aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance would be wafted over to them from the Low Countries, by which means it might be eaſie (if unanimous) to obtain their Liberty, and get immortal Fame by freeing their Country from the preſent ſubjection it lay under. This was heard with general applauſe, and ſprightly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted, eſpecially now <hi>Middleton</hi> was come from the <hi>Netherlands</hi> with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed proviſions for War. This <hi>Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> amongſt other things, brought a ſpecial Commiſſion to be Commander in chief o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:54215:135"/>
all thoſe then in Arms; and under him in the next degree was <hi>Monro</hi> Lieutenant General. This ſpoiled all; for <hi>Glencarne</hi> ſcorned to raiſe an Army for others to command; he loved the Cauſe well, but would not be diſparaged by it: muſt he fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſtir up others, to be brought down himſelf? or take pains for others gains? No, he would not endure this, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was a diminution to his honour, which as a Souldier he equally prized with life. On the other ſide, <hi>Middleton</hi> was too ſtiff to ſtoop; he ſtoutly ſtood to have <hi>Monro</hi> in the ſecond place of Superiority. The conſideration of the dangerous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this falling out, made all the Gentlemen endeavour a Unity: which endeavours prevailed ſo far, as to procure a reconciliation between <hi>Middleton</hi> and <hi>Glencarne,</hi> provided <hi>Glencarne</hi> might be made Lieutenant General. But the pride of <hi>Monro</hi> could by no means condeſcend to this motion.</p>
               <p>VVhen thus they had bandied together for ſome time, at laſt <hi>Glencarne</hi> challengeth <hi>Monro</hi> to a ſingle Combat; which being accepted of, on a certain morning they fought, with fortunate ſucceſs to <hi>Glencarne,</hi>
                  <pb n="264" facs="tcp:54215:136"/>
who wounded and diſarmed his Adverſary, and then immediately after left the Army with about 500 Gentlemen, who made their compoſition with the Governour of <hi>Dunbarton</hi> to live peaceably at home, and leave <hi>Middleton</hi> to ſhift for himſelf.</p>
               <p>Thus diſſention among the Grandees leading the Van, deſtruction quickly after brought up the Reare. For General <hi>Monk</hi> with the Engliſh being not ignorant of theſe tranſactions among the Highlanders, and delaying for ſome time to march a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, till he had ſeen the event of their diviſions, and obſerved his opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ſuppreſs them; upon certain intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of their motion, he advanced to meet them; and engaging <hi>Middleton</hi> at <hi>Lough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerry,</hi> after ſome ſmall bickering the Scots were wholly routed, and <hi>Middleton</hi> enforc'd to flee back again into <hi>Holland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lord Protector in <hi>England</hi> ſeeing on what a tickliſh Foundation his greatneſs ſtood (for though he had obtained a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, yet was it not confirmed to him by the People) therefore according to the tenure of the <hi>Instrument</hi> of <hi>Government,</hi> he ſummoned a Parliament to aſſemble at <hi>Weſtminſter, Septemb.</hi> 3. 1659, when there
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:54215:136"/>
appeared a great number of grave judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſons, men that ſufficiently under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the peoples priviledges, having many times before been Champions to defend them from the enchroachments of Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers. The day before their ſitting, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector went by water from <hi>White-hall</hi> to the <hi>Painted Chamber,</hi> whither he ſent for the Members; where they being come, he deſired their company to hear a Sermon at the Abby-Church the next day, and afterwards he would impart his minde to them. About nine in the morning, his Highneſs (not much affecting pomp and bravery) rode in his Coach to the Church: with him there ſate his Son <hi>Henry</hi> and the Lord <hi>Lambert:</hi> his Gentlemen very rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly clad, marched firſt, bare-headed; next before the Coach, went the Pages; and on one ſide of the Coach walked on foot Mr. <hi>Strickland</hi> one of the Council, and Captain of the Guard, together with the Maſter of the Ceremonies; on the other ſide, in like manner, was Captain <hi>Howard</hi> Captain of the Life-guard. After theſe, followed in Coaches, the Lords Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Great Seal, of the Treaſury, and the Council; at laſt, the ordinary Guard
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:54215:137"/>
of the <hi>Protector</hi> put an end to the train. In this manner he went to the Abby. As he entred the Church, there was born before him four Maces, the Purſe and a Sword, which the Lord <hi>Lambert</hi> carried, bare-headed.</p>
               <p>VVhen <hi>Dr. Goodwin</hi> had ended his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, the Protector and Parliament went to the <hi>Painted Chamber,</hi> where he declared to the Members in a ſet Speech, (briefly thus:)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>THat the Parliament then met, were ſuch a Congregation as</hi> England <hi>never ſaw before; and that it might be a matter worthy ſuch a meeting, to give a Series of Gods Providence all along to theſe times; but that being well known to most of them, he ſhould proceed to let them know in what condition theſe Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were when this Government was ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. Every mans heart was then againſt another: that we had then our humors and intereſts, and every thing almoſt was grown Arbitrary. Next of all, what a prodigious contempt there was of God and
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:54215:137"/>
Chriſt; the Grace of God was turned into wantonneſs, and his Spirit made a Cloak for vile practiſes: yet many would ſay, Matters of Religion belonged not to the Magiſtrate, he was onely to look to the ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter man, not to meddle with the inner. Nay, the abomination was ſwell'd to that height, that the Ax was laid to the root of the Ministry, as Babyloniſh and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian. While theſe things were in the midſt of us, and the Nation rent and torn, one Family againſt another, and nothing in the hearts and minds of men but over-turn, overturn, overturn; at the ſome time ſwarms of Jeſuites coming over, having their Conſiſtories abroad to rule all the Affairs of</hi> England, <hi>and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendencies thereof. Withall, the Nation was deeply engaged in a War with</hi> POR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TUGAL, HOLLAND <hi>and</hi> FRANCE. <hi>In ſuch a heap of Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was this Nation, that a ſpeedy remedy muſt be applyed, and hath been applyed. This Government (let men ſay what they will) is calculated for the peoples intereſt.
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:54215:138"/>
That for his own part, he could with hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs towards God, and modeſty before them, recount ſomething in the behalf of it. Firſt, it had indeavoured to reform the Law: it hath put into ſeats of Juſtice men of known integrity and ability: it hath ſettled a way for probation of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to preach the Goſpel. And beſides, it hath called a free Parliament (bleſſed be God) we ſee this day a free Parliament. As for the Wars; a peace is made with</hi> Sweden, Denmark, <hi>the</hi> Dutch <hi>and</hi> Portugal: <hi>moreover, at this time a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is depending with</hi> France. <hi>Theſe things are but Entrances and Doors of hope: but now he made no queſtion to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able them to lay the top-ſtone of this work. This Maxime he recommended to their obſervation, that</hi> Peace, though it be made, is not to be truſted farther then it conſiſts with Intereſt. <hi>The great work that now lay upon this Parliament, was, that the Government of</hi> Ireland <hi>might be ſettled in terms of honour, and that themſelves would manage Affairs
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:54215:138"/>
with Prudence, leſt forraign States retain hopes of advantage by their confuſions. For himſelf, he did not ſpeak like one that would be a Lord over them, but as one that was reſolved to be a fellow-ſervant with them in this great Affair. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, he wiſhed them to repair to their own houſe, and there uſe their Liberty in the choice of a Speaker.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Protector</hi> having ended his Speech, the Members immediately repaired to the Parliament-houſe, and choſe <hi>William Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thal</hi> Maſter of the Rolls to be their Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker; then they reſolved <hi>to tune the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Government.</hi> The firſt debate was, <hi>Whether the Legiſlative Power ſhould be in a ſingle Perſon and a Parliament.</hi> This Ball was bandied about for ſome time. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectoreans with might and main endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to have the Queſtion reſolved to be no queſtion, but rather to be paſſed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately in the Affirmative. This was ſtrenuouſly oppoſed by the major part of the Houſe: amongſt the reſt, a noble Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman ſtood up and made an excellent Speech, wherein he ſhewed <hi>the Snares that
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:54215:139"/>
then were laid to entrap the Peoples Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges: for his own part, he declared that God had made him Inſtrumental in cutting down Tyranny in one perſon, and now he could not endure to ſee the Nations Liberties rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be ſhakled by another, whoſe right to the Government could be meaſured out no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways then by the length of his Sword; 'twas this imboldned him to command his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders.</hi> To the ſame effect many more Speeches were made, in direct oppoſition to a ſingle Perſon.</p>
               <p>Thus the Parliament for eight days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether run diviſions upon the Protectors Inſtrument, till it jarred ſo much, that it was impoſſible to play one pleaſant Tune for the Court to dance after. This highly offended his <hi>Highneſs,</hi> and made him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to put the Parliament into a better mode, if poſſible: to which end, away he goes by water to the <hi>painted Chamber,</hi> and there ſent for all the Members of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then ſitting, to appear preſently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him: there he declared,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That his ſorrow was very great, to find them falling into heats and diviſions; he
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:54215:139"/>
would have them take notice of this, that the ſame Government that made them a Parliament, made him a Protector; and as they were intrusted with ſome things, ſo he with other things. In the Government there was Fundamentals that could not be altered: as,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Government ſhould be in one Perſon and a Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That Parliaments ſhould not be made perpetual, nor always ſitting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The Militia was not to be truſted in any one hand or power, but ſo, that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament ought to have a check upon the Protector, and the Protector upon the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>That in matters of Religion, there ought to be Liberty of Conſcience, and means uſed to prevent Perſecution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For the reſt of the things in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they were examinable and alterable as the State of Affairs did require. For his own part</hi> (he told them) <hi>his heart was even overwhelmed with grief to ſee that any of them ſhould go about to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:54215:140"/>
what was ſettled, contrary to their trust received from the people; which could not but bring on very great inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this manner he perſwaded them to Conformity in his deſignes: but fearing words might be little regarded, he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore prepared a Laxative Compoſition wrapt up in a Recognition, which was to be taken as followeth:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I do hereby promiſe and engage to be true and faithful to the Lord Protector, and the Commonwealth of</hi> England, Scotland <hi>and</hi> Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; <hi>and ſhall not (according to the tenour of the Indenture where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I am returned to ſerve in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament) propoſe, or give my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to alter the Government, as it is ſetled in one Perſon and a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="273" facs="tcp:54215:140"/>
This doſe purged ſome Members out of the Houſe; and others again ſwallowed it without any reluctancie; ſo that for all this, the Parliament (though they looked ſomewhat thin) continued ſitting five Moneths after, in which time they did much, in doing nothing. The Protector ſeeing how oppoſite they were to his hopes, could not brook theſe their dilatory proceedings; and ſeeing they would not ſettle him, he reſolves to unhouſe them; and accordingly takes the firſt opportunity his Inſtrument would give him (not ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping one day) and diſſolved them.</p>
               <p>Upon the very nick of this Cataſtrophe, the Court was Alarm'd with news of a great riſing in <hi>Shropſhire, Montgomery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, Wiltſhire, Nottinghamſhire, Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland and Yorkshire;</hi> it is needleſs to tell the riſe and growth of theſe male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents: their folly and fall may ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently manifeſt, there were ſecret inviſible ſprings that turned the maine wheels of this Deſign. However, the Protector continued ſtill Victorious, and triumphed over his Enemies.</p>
               <p>Long had the World ſtood in amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the Protectors mighty preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:54215:141"/>
wondering what the intent ſhould be, or event would prove: The Deſign was too deep to be eaſily fathomed, being managed with ſuch ſecreſie, that the chief Commanders both by Land and Sea, who were to put it in practice, knew not at firſt what they went about; onely this they were aſſured of, that it was for the honour of God, the good of their Countrey, and would be to themſelves a profitable glory. Time, with great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry and vaſt ſums of money, having at laſt produced two mighty Fleets, one of them was commanded by General <hi>Blake,</hi> who (being fitted onely for the Sea) ſailed away to the Straights: about two Months after, the other Fleet put out to Sea, commanded by General <hi>Pen,</hi> who took aboard him a Land-Army, under Conduct of General <hi>Venables.</hi> Theſe Land-Forces being in all three thouſand, were divided into five Regiments, under their reſpective Commanders, and diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted through the Navie, conſiſting of about thirty Sail of good Ships, but provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with neceſſaries (neither ſutable nor ſufficient) for ſo long a Voyage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Decemb.</hi> the 19th 1654. this Eleet ſet
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:54215:141"/>
ſail from <hi>Portſmouth</hi> for the <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> the appointed place of Randezvous: it pleaſed God to give them a ſpeedy paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, inſomuch that the 29 of <hi>January,</hi> they were all at Anchor in <hi>Carliſle</hi> Bay, and preſently landed their men upon the Iſland.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Spain</hi> all this while, not being aſſured that theſe Forces were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned againſt him, yet by many circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances believing no leſs, he ſent a ſpeedy Mandate to the Marqueſs <hi>de Leda</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> to paſs into <hi>England</hi> in the quality of an extraordinary Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, that ſo he might know the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty thereof. This gallant Commander (for ſo indeed he was) preſently after ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at <hi>London</hi> accordingly: but after ſome ſtay, finding little ſatisfaction in his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diences, he returned back again to give an account to his Maſter.</p>
               <p>But to return: during the abode of the Fleet at the <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> the Generals, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonels, and inferiour Officers were not negligent in their ſeveral ſtations. Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Pen</hi> cauſed the Carpenters of each Ship to ſet up thoſe Shallops which were brought over in Quarters out of <hi>England:</hi>
                  <pb n="276" facs="tcp:54215:142"/>
And ordered the Coopers to trim and fit water-Casks: Beſides, he ſent two Frigats to S. <hi>Chriſtophers</hi> and <hi>Mevis,</hi> for raiſing of Voluntiers there. In the mean time, General <hi>Venables</hi> formed a new Regiment of Sea-men to ſerve upon occaſion at Land; theſe were put under the Conduct of Vice-Admiral <hi>Goodſon;</hi> the reſt of the Regiments brought out of <hi>England,</hi> were eaſily compleated to a full number: Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, a Troop of gallant Horſe were raiſed by the Iſlanders, at their own coſt and charges (the Carcaſes of which were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards buryed in the Souldiers bellies, for want of better food.) But theſe were not all the ſtrength: for the Planters Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants underſtanding that if they would ſerve the State, their time ſhould ſtill go on, and that at laſt (in ſpight of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters) they ſhould enjoy their Freedoms in as ample a manner as if they had ſerved them; this ſpurred them on to become Souloiers of Fortune; and many were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently liſted into ſeveral Regiments ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. The Fleet was alſo augmented by twenty Sail of Duch Veſſels, which were made prize for preſuming to traffick with prohibited goods contrary to the Articles
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:54215:142"/>
of Peace betwixt the two Nations. The Land-Army being now in a readineſs, their number was found to be ſo great, that every Ships ſhare was as many as it could well carry. <hi>March</hi> 31. they ſet ſail, from the <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> and in ſix dayes after came by the Lee under S. <hi>Chriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers.</hi> Here joyned with them about 1300 more, which came off from ſeveral Iſlands, in hopes to be made for ever. From hence they ſhaped their courſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly for <hi>Hiſpaniola.</hi> On the 13 of <hi>April</hi> the whole Navie came fair by the Iſland, and plainly diſcovered the Town of <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta Domingo:</hi> immediately hereupon, a Council was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> called, and the Guides con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted withal: here it was concluded that General <hi>Venables</hi> ſhould to Land. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which reſolution, the next day he landed about ten Leagues to the Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the Town, with 7000 Foot, a Troop of Horſe, and three days Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Victuals. No ſooner were they landed, but every mans tongue was tipt with gold; nothign could be thought on, but the plunder of Plate and Jewels; ſmall things could not enter their mindes: as for Hangings, Houſhold-ſtuff, &amp;c. they
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:54215:143"/>
would be cumberſome to carry, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they reſolved to leave ſuch things behinde them. In this extacy of joy was the Souldiery; when behold, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſudden, there appeared a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation from the General, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that when they entered the Town of <hi>Sancta Domingo,</hi> no man ſhould preſume to plunder either money, Plate, or Jewels, neither kill any tame Cattel, on pain of death. This made the Army look ſowre on their imaginary ſweet-meats; their golden hearts were now turned to lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den heels; ſo that it was indifferent to them, whether they went farther, or tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried there: Yet for all this, on they march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thorow Woods of incredible thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, receiving no oppoſition, except the exceſſive heat of the Sun, which cauſed an intolerable drought, that oppreſſed them ſorely, having not had one drop of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in many miles march, but what they carried in their own bladders; ſo that Urine was as white-wine to them that could ſwallow it.</p>
               <p>General <hi>Pen,</hi> after the landing of theſe men, ſet aſhore three Regiments more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the command of Colonel <hi>Bullard,</hi> in
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:54215:143"/>
a Bay where a fair freſh-water River disburdened it ſelf; this was within two Leagues of the Town, and appointed to be the place for conjuncton of the whole Army. It was not long before the General (according to appointment) having peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably paſt the Woods, came to the River, and joyned himſelf with <hi>Bullards</hi> Brigade. Here, upon view, the Army was found to be 9700 (but few fighting) men. From this ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Army haſted-away to take poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Town, which in imagination was already won: there marched on before the reſt, a forlorn Hope conſiſting of 500 men; afterward followed the main body of the Army: in this order they marched within four miles of the Town, when up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſudden a ſmall party of <hi>Spaniards</hi> encountred the forlorn Hope, and in an inſtant forced them in confuſion thorow the next Regiment, which was alſo routed: the Body of the Army coming up to their reſcue, made the Enemy retire to a Fort hard by in the Woods, without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable loſs at all to the <hi>Spaniards:</hi> on the Engliſh ſide was ſlain Captain <hi>Cox,</hi> the chief Guide for the place, &amp; many others.</p>
               <p>The General having now ſeen the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becility
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:54215:144"/>
of his men, through want of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and many other neceſſaries, he cauſed them to march back again to the River from whence they came, to refreſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in order to a full proſecution of the Deſign in hand. To which end, ſcaling lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were made, and two ſmall Drakes mounted, with a Mortar-piece and Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do-ſhels which were landed from the Fleet: theſe were conveyed by water to be ſet on ſhore at a convenient place near the Town. All things being now in readineſs, to try concluſions, the Army once again diſlodged, and were by the Guides promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be brought upon the Town of S. <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingo</hi> by a private way, where they might paſs thorow the Woods free from danger of any Fort. Such a way there certainly was; but theſe blind Guides taking another to be it, the whole Army were brought near to the place where before they had been ſhamefully repulſed. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> mean time having certain intelligence by <hi>Negroes</hi> and <hi>Molattoes</hi> of the Engliſh march, prepared to entertain them in their paſſage. <hi>April</hi> 25. 1655. the whole Army approached near to a Fort which the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> had in the Wood built of Brick, in a
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:54215:144"/>
triangular form without Flankers: in it were nine Pieces of good Ordinance, and 300 reſolute fellows to manage them. The Engliſh Army a little before noon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching near this Fort, were upon the ſudden charged by a Party of the Enemy that lay undiſcovered among the Trees: theſe reſolute <hi>Spaniards,</hi> being about ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty in number, at firſt fired a round Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of ſmall ſhot upon the forlorne Hope, and then flew in like mad-men with their ſharpe Steel Lances upon the Engliſh (who were already even ſuffocated with thirſt, and hardly able to ſtand, much leſs to fight) ſo that in a moment the Generals running Regiment, with near half the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, flew back to the Rear, and poſſeſt their fellows there with ſuch a pannick fear, that every one began to ſhift for himſelf. Mean while the <hi>Spaniards</hi> purſued their Victory with the greateſt ſlaughter they were able to make: for meeting with no reſiſtance (but what that ever-renowned Gentleman Major-General <hi>Haines</hi> was able to make alone of himſelf, who never ſtirred one ſtep, but dyed not unrevenged in the mid'ſt of his Enemies,) they wreaked their fury at pleaſure on theſe daſtardly dunces;
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:54215:145"/>
till at laſt, being overcome with killing, they retreated back in Triumph with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Engliſh Colours, the evident Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies of their Victory. The Retreat of the Enemy, gave opportunity for the living to number the dead: upon view, it was found that 600 were ſlain out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, 300 wounded, (moſt in their backs) and beſides, 200 more crept into buſhes, and ran away to ſave themſelves; which afterwards were knockt on the head by <hi>Negro's</hi> and <hi>Mollatto's.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon this ſad diſaſter, the Army that night drew up nearer the Spaniſh Fort, as if they intended ſome mighty matters; and having planted a Morter-Peice in a convenient plot of ground, and all things being ready to do execution on the Fort, upon a ſudd<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n the ſouldiers were ordered to draw off: ſo the Army without doing any thing, marched away to their old watering place in the Bay. To what intent and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe this was, I ſhall be ſilent, and leave it for others to judge.</p>
               <p>The Army being come into the Bay, had not that ſupply of Victuals from the ſhips as formerly, but were neceſſitated by parties to go in the Woods to catch Cattel; which
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:54215:145" rendition="simple:additions"/>
many times coſt them dear: for the <hi>Negro's</hi> inſtead of hunting Cows, would often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times change their game, and breath them back again to their Quarters. Theſe things brought the Army to ſuch diſtreſs, that (fearing to fight for Food abroad) they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed their Valour at home upon the Troop-horſes belonging to their own Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: thus did they continue for ſome days, till a reſolution was taken to imbark them, and with all ſpeed to make for <hi>Jamaica. May</hi> the third day, (all the remaining part of the Army being ſhipped) without the leaſt diſturbance from the Spaniard, the Fleet ſet ſail for the aforeſaid Iſland. On the tenth of the ſame moneth, the whole Fleet caſt Anchor in <hi>Jamaica</hi> Harbour, and quickly after poſſeſt themſelves of <hi>Orista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> the chief Town in the Iſland: here the Army having taken up their ſtanding, began to plant (which ſince hath been and is like to prove a bad Neighbour to the adjacent Spaniſh Iſlands.) General <hi>Pen</hi> preſently after returned for <hi>England,</hi> and was quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly followed by General <hi>Venables,</hi> to give an account to the Court of the brave ſervice they had performed for the honour of their Country; which pleaſed the Protector ſo
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:54215:146"/>
well, that he ſent them both to the Tower of <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This unfortunate Voyage to <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> cannot well be let paſs without ſome ſmall inſpection into the miſcarriage of the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Where there is want of Food, and Arms fitting for an Army, they muſt of neceſſity become a prey to their Enemies: neither of which were ſufficiently provided for in the beginning, as they ought to have been. It hath been alwayes the policy of Conquerous, firſt to poſſeſs, and then to plant: but the Wives and Children in this expedition, ſhewed a confidence in the fruition, before they gained poſſeſſion. <hi>Alexander</hi> at his entrance into the Wars of <hi>Perſia,</hi> had but 35000 men; which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſufficient to carry on his enterpriſe. By this we ſee, two thouſand <hi>Cocks</hi> are better to fight then ten thouſand <hi>Capons.</hi> But above all, if the ſpring be corrupted, the ſtream cannot run clear: Where covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is at the root, the branches of a deſign are alwayes blaſted: This made <hi>Achan</hi> proſper no better with his ill gotten gold. A General that will prohibit plundering in an Enemies Country, muſt reſolve to do all the ſervice himſelf: for Souldiers will
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:54215:146"/>
ſuffer him to win all, that muſt wear all.</p>
               <p>To dwell longer on this lamentable lame Story, can be no way uſeful, unleſs it be to call to minde that excellent ſaying, <hi>Man propoſeth, but God diſpoſeth.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to ſweeten the bitterneſs of the blow received in <hi>America,</hi> it will not be much amiſs to recount brave <hi>Blakes</hi> ſucceſſes in <hi>Affrica.</hi> Not long before <hi>Pen</hi> ſet ſaile for the unfortunate Iſlands, <hi>Blake</hi> ſet forth with a conſiderable Navy to ſcowre the <hi>Straights</hi> from Pirats which had much dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified the Engliſh Merchants in their paſſage out of the Levant Sea. At firſt he beat about on the Spainſh Coaſt, in hopes to finde them roving abroad; but miſſing of his expectation, a ſudden reſolution was taken up to fire their neſts, and conſume their ſhipping in the very Harbors: to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect this, <hi>April</hi> 18. 1655. the Fleet appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching near <hi>Tunis,</hi> General <hi>Blake</hi> ſent to the <hi>Dye,</hi> demanding ſatisfaction for ſhips taken, and a ſpeedy releaſe of the poor Engliſh taken in them, from their preſent Captivity. To this Meſſage ſuch an arrogant Anſwer was returned by the imperious <hi>Turk,</hi> as very much enraged the Engliſh Sea-men; inſomuch that after a ſmall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:54215:147"/>
it was concluded to revenge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on nine ſhips that lay in <hi>Porta Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rino:</hi> the wind at preſent ſitting fair, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged a preſent proſecution of the deſigned project, which was effected in this manner: At firſt, there entered the Harbour the Boats of every Ship man'd with reſolute Sea-men; and then followed <hi>Blake</hi> himſelf in the Admiral, with the Vice-Admiral, and Rear-Admiral: Theſe lying within Musket-ſhot of the Enemies Caſtle and Forts, plagued them perpetually with whole broad ſides, until the Boats had utterly conſumed the Turkiſh men of War, which were reduced to aſhes in four hours time, with no more loſs to the Engliſh, then 25 men ſlain, and 48 wounded. This may in part wipe off the blemiſh which ſtained <hi>Englands</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation in the former diſaſtrous Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
               <p>At this time, the Lord Protector en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to ſtrengthen himſelf abroad, made an alliance with the <hi>Swede;</hi> the effects of which Peace have ſince been felt to purpoſe, in ſome parts of <hi>Europe.</hi> Then preſently after, he conſtituted Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor-Generals, and divided <hi>England</hi> into

               <p>Theſe Major-Generals in their reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Provinces, did the Protector no ſmall ſervice, in forcing Delinquents to pay the Decimation of their Eſtates, which was impoſed upon them by the Court (for the ſins of their youth;) he very well knowing:
<q>
                     <l>'Tis good for Princes to have all things fat,</l>
                     <l>Except their ſubjects; but beware of that.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Yet this new device after a while grew troubleſome to the grand Projector him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who fearing they might in time eclipſe his own greatneſs, (if continued) brought them down again to move in an inferiour Orb.</p>
               <p>Another deſigne (of a far different na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but for like ends with the former) was about this time ſet on foot by the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:54215:148"/>
to wit, the re-admiſſion of the Jews into this Nation. This people indeed were ſometime Gods peculiar people, <hi>to whom pertained the adoption, and the Glory, and the Covenant, and the giving of the Law, and the ſervice of God, and the promiſes:</hi> inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that <hi>Moſes</hi> thus expoſtulates with them; <hi>What Nation is there ſo great, who hath God ſo nigh unto them, as the Lord our God is in all things that we call upon him for?</hi> But as if all this had not been ſufficient, it pleaſed God ſo far further to honour them, that <hi>of them, according to the fleſh, Chriſt came;</hi> who although he were <hi>approved of God among them, by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, wonders and ſigns,</hi> for their convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; Yet they entertained him with crucifixion, uttering this direful impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereupon, <hi>His bloud be upon us and our children.</hi> God took them at their word. For (not to mention what ſome affirm, that a bloudy iſſue hath ever ſince hereditarily deſcended upon them) not long after (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Chriſts prophecy) their City was deſtroyed, their Temple not on ſtone left upon another; and themſelves ceaſing to be a Nation, became (with <hi>Cain)</hi> Fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and Vagabonds upon the Earth;
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:54215:149"/>
having now, according to that prophecie of <hi>Hoſea) been many dayes</hi> (yea many years) <hi>without a King, and without a Prince, and without a ſacrifice, and without an image, and without an Ephod, and without a tera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phim;</hi> being diſperſed amongſt all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and hated by all people: remaining nevertheleſs in ſuch a degree of contuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious obduration, that here in <hi>England</hi> (whither ſome of them wandred) they crucified children in deſpight to (and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſion of) the name of Chriſt. For which, and other execrable practices, they were juſtly expelled this Nation by King <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, in the year of Chriſts incarnation, 1291. And ſo willing were the people then to be rid of them, that for this Act of that King, the Commons in Parliament freely granted him a whole Fifteenth. Thus they were expulſed; and ever ſince (for the ſpace of 364 years) they have been excluded, without the publike permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſo much as one Synagogue in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this our Protector having a large (I ſay not conſcience, but) heart, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of tender bowels, his charity extended ſo far, as to plead for the re-entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:54215:149"/>
of theſe gueſts: to which purpoſe, he propounded it to ſeveral eminent Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters for their approbation; alleadging, that ſince there is a promiſe of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, means muſt be uſed to that end, which is the preaching of the Goſpel; and that cannot be had, except they be permitted to reſide where the Goſpel is preached. But (by his leave) when Gods good time is come, there ſhall not be means wanting to accompliſh that work; which being of an extraordinary nature, is not like to be done by ordinary means. Beſides, ſuch was (then, and yet is) the temper of the people of <hi>England,</hi> ſo full of diverſities in opinions, and reduced to ſuch an indifferencie in matters of Religion, that it is more then probable, the number of their Proſelytes would have exceeded that of our Converts.</p>
               <p>But this is not all: for it ſeems our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors charity that we mentioned before, (according to the Proverb) began at home: he had a promiſe of 200000 l. from the Jews, in caſe he procured their Toleration here, as ſaith Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> in his Narrative, p. 56. which ſweet morſel he had ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by thus gratifying them, had not the
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:54215:150"/>
deſign been oppoſed by Arguments as ſharp as weapons of STEEL.</p>
               <p>The War with <hi>Spain</hi> beginning now to wax warm, not onely under the Torrid Zone, but likewiſe Northwards of the Tropick; the Protector thought it beſt to annoy this Enemy in as many places as poſſible; which could not well be brought about without a Peace with <hi>France,</hi> which being effected, roome might be made for Engliſh Feet to tread Fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh ground. The French at this time earneſtly deſired the ſame: for their chief miniſter of State Cardinal <hi>Mazarine</hi> ſaw every Champaign, how prejudicious it was to his Maſters Affairs in <hi>Flanders</hi> (eſpecially in beſieging a Sea-Port Town) to be without correſpondencie with <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> This gave the Protector not onely opportunity of making up the long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued feud that had been betwixt the two Nations, but to do it on very advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous terms, wherein the French King was content to deny himſelf, in ſending out of his Dominions his near relations the <hi>Stuarts;</hi> which kindneſs the Protector requited, with ſending him 6000 Foot-Souldiers. Thus the alliance was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="293" facs="tcp:54215:150"/>
The impediments that hindered Peace with <hi>France</hi> being paſt over, to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors great content, he ſet himſelf wholy to a thorow proſecution of his Wars with <hi>Spain.</hi> For this purpoſe, the two Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals <hi>Blake</hi> and <hi>Montague,</hi> had with a ſtrong Navie long beleaguered the Port of <hi>Cadiz</hi> by Sea, and with many provocations en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to dare out an Enemy: but the grave-pac'd Spaniard durſt not ſtep one ſtride to drive the Engliſh from his coaſts; but rather waited the lucky hour, when ſcarcity of proviſions, or diſtreſs by wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would do the work to his hand, and ſave the Limbs and Lives of many good Catholicks which might miſcarry in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Engliſh farther off. But this piece of Policy little prevailed: for when the Fleet wanted water and other neceſſaries, the Generals found out a way to ſupply it, by ſayling to the Bay of <hi>Wyers</hi> in <hi>Portugal,</hi> whence they were recruted; in the mean time, leaving behind Captain <hi>Stayner</hi> with a Squadron of ſeven Ships to have an eye on <hi>Cadiz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now it hapned that in the abſence of the Generals, a ſtiff gale of wind forc't <hi>Stainer</hi> to ply it off to Sea, which brought him
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:54215:151"/>
upon the diſcovery of an excellent ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; it was the King of <hi>Spaines</hi> Plate-Fleet, richly laden with Gold, Silver, Pearl, and other good commodities new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought from the <hi>Indies.</hi> The Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards at the firſt ſight of the Engliſh Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats, took them for Fiſher-boats; which indeed they were, in a ſenſe; for Captain <hi>Stainers</hi> work was to fiſh for gold; and now ſeeing ſo fair a ſhole ſwimming, he thought he would be ſure to catch ſome conſiderable quantity, or loſe his life in the attempt: wherefore with theſe three, the <hi>Speaker, Bridgwater,</hi> and <hi>Plymouth</hi> Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats, (the remaining part of the Squadron being driven to Leeward) he gallantly fell upon the Spaniſh great Galleons, which were ſeven in number; and plyed them ſo ſore with great ſhot, that in few hours the whole Fleet was quite ſpoyled; one whereof was ſunk, another burnt, two forc'd on ground, one run away, and two remained in the Conquerours hands, which were ſafely conveyed to <hi>England,</hi> and very joyfully received by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, who ſet apart a particular day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to give God thanks for this good ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>The Protector being much neceſſitated
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:54215:151"/>
for money, and withal impatient to tarry longer for a Confirmation of his Dignity by the People, which although he could not obtain of the preceding Parliament, he hoped he might gain of another; this perſwaded him to attempt once more a new Repreſentative: Which being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved upon, he iſſued out Writs for E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection throughout the three Nations.</p>
               <p>But remembring the Speeches and carriage of ſome in the late Parliament; private intimation was given to certain perſons in ſeveral Counties, to obſtruct (if poſſible) their Election again in this enſuing Seſſion: yet for all this, the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of people being ſwayed by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, made choyce of them they thought ſit, and ſuch as were moſt able to carry on the weighty affairs of the Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Septemb.</hi> 17. 1656, being appointed for the general meeting at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> the Members accordingly made their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance at the Parliament Houſe, where they found (quite contrary to the ancient Priviledge of Parliament) that no Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers could<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> enter into the Houſe, except they were firſt tyed up in a promiſe, Not
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:54215:152"/>
to act any thing prejudicial to the preſent Government. Many of the Members would not bite at this Bait, but rather choſe to return home again, ſeeing they could not ſit with a ſafe conſcience. Thoſe that entered the Houſe, having made choyce of Sir <hi>Thomas Widdrington</hi> to be their Speaker, began to act an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the Protectors own deſire: which we ſhall ſee in its due place; mean time, take this enſuing Relation of General <hi>Blakes</hi> worthy exploit againſt the Spaniard.</p>
               <p>Of all the deſperate Attemps that ever were made in the World againſt an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my by Sea, this of noble <hi>Blakes</hi> is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to any: He lying upon the Spaniſh Coaſt, had intelligence given him, that the <hi>West-India</hi> Fleet were arrived at the <hi>Canary Iſlands,</hi> and put into the Bay of <hi>Sancta Cruz,</hi> on the Iſland of <hi>Tenariff.</hi> Upon this, the Fleet weighs Anchor on the 13 of <hi>April</hi> 1657. and by the 20th of the ſame Month, were fair in the <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing</hi> of <hi>Sancta Cruz,</hi> where they diſcovered how bravely the Spaniſh Ships, (ſixteen in number) were barricado'd in this Bay, where they lay in a manner Semi-circular.
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:54215:152"/>
Near to the mouth of this Haven, ſtands a Caſtle ſufficiently furniſhed with great Ordinance, which threatned deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to any that durſt enter without its leave into the Harbour: beſides this, there ſtood ſeven Forts more, round about the Bay, with ſix, four, and three great Guns apiece, and united together by a Line of Communication from one Fort to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which was man'd with Muſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers. To make all ſafe, <hi>Don Diego Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues,</hi> General of the Spaniſh Fleet, was not idle, in making proviſion for the beſt defence of his Armado: he cauſed all the ſmaller ſhips to be mored cloſe along the ſhoar, and the ſix great Galleons ſtood farther out at anchor, with their broad ſides towards the Sea: It hapned at this time, there was a Dutch Merchants ſhip in the Bay; the Maſter whereof ſeeing the Engliſh ready to enter, and that a combate would preſently be commenced, it made him fear that among all the blows that would be given, he could not avoyd ſome knocks; therefore to ſave himſelf, he went to <hi>Don Diego,</hi> and deſired his leave to depart the Harbour: For (ſaid he) <hi>I am very ſure,</hi> Blake <hi>will preſently be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:54215:153"/>
you.</hi> To this, the reſolute <hi>Don</hi> made no other Reply, but, <hi>Get you gone if you will, and let</hi> Blake <hi>come if he dares.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They that knew <hi>Blakes</hi> courage, could not but know it needleſs to dare him to an engagement; for himſelf was ever for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward enough to fight, eſpecially when the honour of his Nation lay at ſtake: like himſelf were his Sea-men, who never queſtioned Commands, but readily ran upon the moſt deſperate attemps: which ſheweth, that courage in a Commander, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth activity in the Souldiers; as here it did in an eminent manner: for Gen. <hi>Blake</hi> having ſeen his Enemy, preſently called a Council of Officers to contrive the beſt way for carrying on the preſent exploit. In this Council of War, Glory quite ecli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pſed hazard; ſo that little elſe was diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon, but a quick Execution, which quite buryed difficulty in Oblivion. All things being ordered for fight, a Squadron of Ships was drawn out of the whole Fleet to make the firſt Onſet: theſe were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Captain <hi>Stainer,</hi> in the <hi>Speaker</hi> Frigat; who no ſooner had received Orders, but immediately he flew into the Bay with his canvas wings, and by eight in the
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:54215:153"/>
morning fell pell-mell upon the Spainſh Fleet, without the leaſt regard to the Forts, that ſpent their ſhot prodigally upon him. No ſooner were theſe entered into the Bay, but <hi>Blake</hi> following after, placed cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Ships to pour broad ſides into the Caſtle and Forts; theſe played their parts ſo well, that after ſome time the <hi>Spaniards</hi> found their Forts too hot to be held. In the mean time, <hi>Blake</hi> ſtrikes in with <hi>Stainer,</hi> and bravely fought the Spaniſh Ships, which were not much inferiour in number to the Engliſh, but in men they were far the ſuperior. Here we ſee, a reſolute bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very many times may carry the day, and make number lie by the Lee: this was manifeſt; for by two of the Clock in the after-noon, the Engliſh had beaten their Enemies out of their Ships.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Blake</hi> ſeeing an impoſſibility of carrying them away, he ordered his men to fire their prizes: which was done ſo ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually, that all the Spaniſh Fleet were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to aſhes, except two Ships that ſunk downright, nothing remaining of them above water, but ſome part of their maſts.</p>
               <p>The Engliſh having now got a compleat
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:54215:154"/>
victory, were put to another difficulty by the wind, which blew ſo ſtrong into the Bay, that many deſpaired of getting out again. But Gods providence was mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly ſeen, in cauſing the wind upon the ſudden to vere about to the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt (a thing not known in many years before) which brought <hi>Blake</hi> and his Fleet ſafe to Sea again, notwithſtanding the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> from the Caſtle played their great Guns perpetually upon them as they paſſed by. The wind, as it proved a friend to bring the Engliſh forth, ſo it continued to carry them back again to their former ſtation near to <hi>Cadiz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Should we compare the vaſtneſs of this attempt with the diminutive loſs the Engliſh received, it may go near to raiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulity in the Reader. However, it muſt not be paſt over in ſilence. All the men that <hi>Blake</hi> had ſlain in this fight, which laſted from eight in the morning to ſeven at night, were but 48<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and one hundred and twenty wounded. On the Spaniſh ſide, all was loſt that could be loſt, their whole Fleet being quite deſtroyed; ſo that the Engliſh gain was nothing but Honour, which ever attended <hi>Blakes</hi> attempts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="301" facs="tcp:54215:154"/>
For this good ſervice, the Protector at the Parliaments deſire ſent this worthy Commander a Ring worth five hundred pounds, and preſently after Capt. <hi>Stainer</hi> came to <hi>England</hi> that his Ship might be new fitted for the Sea, which gave the Protector a fair opportunity to clap on his ſhoulders a whole Knighthood, which ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to ſatisfie for all his brave ſervices.</p>
               <p>The Protector, according to a private agreement with <hi>France,</hi> prapared a Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gade of Foot to joyn with the French Army under Command of Marſhal <hi>Turin,</hi> that ſo both together might fall into <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> againſt the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> The Engliſh Forces deſigned for this ſervice, were 6000. many of them old Souldiers, but moſt new raiſed men; over whom Sir <hi>John Reynolds</hi> was made Commander in Chief, and Col. <hi>Morgan</hi> Major-General (who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards was Knighted by the Lord <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Cromwel</hi> for his eminent ſervice) theſe being provided with all neceſſaries for a march, were rendezvouſed on Black-Heath; from whence they marched away to the Sea-ſide, and were immediately tranſported over to <hi>Bulloin</hi> in <hi>Picardy.</hi> At their landing, the Souldiers had all new
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:54215:155"/>
Red-Coats, diſtributed amongſt them, which made ſuch a gliſtering ſhow, that the French King ſaid he never before ſaw the like ſight. About the later end of <hi>October</hi> 1657. the Engliſh were advanced into the Spaniſh Territories; and being joyned with <hi>Turin,</hi> the whole Army ſate down before <hi>Mardike-</hi>Fort lying about two miles from <hi>Dunkirk.</hi> This place was looked upon to be of great importance, and might much conduce to the taking in of <hi>Dunkirk</hi> it ſelf, (as afterwards it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.) The French and Engliſh having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaguered this ſtrong place, did not lie long before they reduced it to a ſurrender up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Compoſition; ſo that it was delivered up wholly into the poſſeſſion of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh. But preſently after (the French be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing withdrawn into winter-Quarters) came a ſtrong body of <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and made a fierce Camiſado upon the Fort, hoping to give the Engliſh little joy in their new Conqueſt; but it fell out quite otherwiſe: for the aſſailants were ſtoutly repulſed, and inforc't to flee, having loſt in the attempt ſeveral brave Commanders.</p>
               <p>The Protectors forraign affairs ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a poſture anſwerable to his deſires,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:54215:155"/>
his domeſtick deſignes at the ſame time did likewiſe very well correſpond thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: for the Parliament having ſate near nine Months, had in this time paſt many Acts which crowned the Protectors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>hopes ſo fully, that more could not have been deſired by him, nor well granted by them. For firſt, out of a deep ſence of his loſs (ſhould ſuch a deſign as bold <hi>Syndercomb</hi>'s take effect) they made proviſions for the ſecurity of his Highneſs Perſon, wherein it was Enacted <hi>High Treaſon, for any to attempt, compaſs, or imagine the Protectors death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Act having pared the claws of cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick humours at home, in three whoops more, the Title of <hi>Charls Stuart,</hi> &amp;c. was utterly defunct.

The Acts made for this purpoſe, were theſe that follow:

were by him paſſed; at which time he made this ſhort Speech to the Parliaments Speaker.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I perceive, that among theſe many Acts of Parliament, there hath been a very great care had by the Parliament to provide for the just and neceſſary ſupport of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, by theſe Bills for levying of money now brought to me, which I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven my conſent unto: and underſtanding it hath been the practice of thoſe who have been chief Governours, to acknowledge with thanks to the Commons, their care and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the Publike, I do very heartily and thankefully acknowledge their kindneſs herein.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Protectors thanks for this, could do no leſs then animate the Parliament to compleat the great work they were about for ſettlement of the Nation. This bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs had been dayly debated, and was almoſt brought to perfection, when on a ſudden, a Petition was uſhered into the Houſe by a worthy Citizen of <hi>London,</hi> to have his Highneſs one Tittle higher in his Title. Hereupon, the great Machine of
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:54215:157"/>
                  <hi>Englands</hi> Government, called the Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Advice, was haſtened away to the Protectors view, with a deſire that his Highneſs would be pleaſed to magnifie himſelf with the Title of KING. Alas! what thing more averſe to his nature could be preſented to him, then this? It was not to ſit in high places, that made him undertake the Government, but rather to be a Servant to his Countrey: Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie he knew was as odious to the Army, as (according to the proverb) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons among the people; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could not look upon this other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways then as a Temptation to try the ſtrength of his reſolution againſt that which before had like to have wrackt the peoples Liberties; which (ſaid he) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly had fallen out, had not he ſtept into the ſea of bloud, and with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible Arms preſerved the Ship of State from thoſe Piratical inchroachers that were ready to board her. Yet to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unadviſedly, nor without mature de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation, his Highneſs took time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn the Parliament this poſitive anſwer (to their liquoriſh deſire) which he with much meekneſs gave them in the Painted
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:54215:157"/>
Chamber, in theſe words: <hi>That he could not undertake the Government with the Title of King.</hi> Upon this, the Parliament voted that <hi>Protector</hi> ſhould be the ſtile of the chief Magiſtrate.</p>
               <p>All things being now brought to matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the <hi>Petition and Advice,</hi> and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wanting to make it a Law, but onely the Protectors condeſcention; a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee was ſent to deſire a Conference with his Highneſs: which he granted, and appointed the place of meeting to be in the Painted Chamber. <hi>May</hi> 25. 1657. his Highneſs (attended by his chief Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers) came accordingly; and there the Speaker Sir <hi>Thomas Widdrington,</hi> preſented him with the Parliaments <hi>Petition and Advice;</hi> the ſubſtance whereof was as followeth:</p>

                  <hi>That he came thither that day, not as to a Triumph, but with the moſt ſerious thoughts that ever he had in all his Life, being to undertake one of the greateſt bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens that ever was laid upon the back of any humane creature; ſo that without the ſupport of the Almighty, he muſt ſinke under the weight of it, to the damage and prejudice of theſe Nations. This being
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:54215:159"/>
ſo, he muſt ask help of the Parliament, and of thoſe that fear God, that by their prayers he might receive aſsiſtance from God: for nothing elſe could enable him to the diſcharge of ſo great a duty and trust.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That ſeeing this is but an Introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the carrying on of the Government of theſe Nations, and there being many things which cannot be ſupplied without the aſsistance of Parliament, it was his duty to ask their help in them; not that he doubted: for the</hi> ſame Spirit <hi>that had led the Parliament to this, would eaſily ſuggeſt the ſame to them. For his part, nothing would have induced him to take this unſupportable burthen to fleſh and blood, but that he had ſeen in the Parliament a great care in doing thoſe things, which might really anſwer the ends that we have engaged for, and make clearly for the liberty of the Nations, and of the Intereſt and preſervation of all ſuch as fear God under various Forms. And if theſe Nations be not
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:54215:160"/>
thankful to them for their care therein, it will fall as a ſin on their heads.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yet there are ſome things wanting that tend to reformation, to the diſcountenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing vice, &amp; the encouragement of vertue: but he ſpake not this as in the leaſt doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their progreſs, but as one that doth heartily deſire, to the end God may Crown their work, that in their own time, and with what ſpeed they judge fit, theſe things may be provided for.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Speech being ended, the Members returned again to the Houſe: and in few dayes after, the Speaker received a Letter from the Protector, deſiring the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to adjourn their ſitting till further time. Hereupon, the ſpeedy Inauguration of his Highneſs was concluded upon. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, <hi>June</hi> 26. 1657. all things being prepared in <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi> Hall for this great ſolemnity, the Protector (about two of the clock in the after-noon) went by wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Lords Houſe; and after ſome ſhort retirement into a room near the Painted Chamber, he came forth, atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:54215:160"/>
by the chief Grandees of his Court: all theſe being marſhalled into Ranks and Files, marched away with his Highneſs to the place appointed in <hi>Weſtminſter-</hi>Hall; where the Protector having taken his ſtanding, under a cloath of Eſtate, the Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker (Sir <hi>Thomas Widdrington)</hi> in the name of the Parliament preſented to him a Robe of Purple-Velvet lined with Ermines, a Bible, a Sword, and a Scepter, (all which were precious tokens of the Parliaments favor) at the delivery of theſe things, the Speaker made a ſhort Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon them to the Protector, which he divided into four parts, as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>followeth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Robe of Purple, <hi>this is an embleme of Magiſtracy, and imports Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and Justice: When you have put on this Veſtment, I may ſay you are a Gown-man. This</hi> Robe <hi>is of a mixt colour, to ſhew the mixture of Juſtice and Mercy. Indeed, a Magiſtrate muſt have two hands:</hi> Plectentem, &amp; am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plectentem.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Bible <hi>is a Book that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:54215:161"/>
the Holy Scriptures, in which you have the happineſs to be well verſ'd. This Book of Life conſiſts of two Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the Old and New: the first is</hi> Chriſtum Velatum; <hi>in the ſecond, is</hi> Chriſtum Revelatum: <hi>it is a Book of Books, and doth contain both Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and Examples for good Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Here is a</hi> Scepter, <hi>not unlike a ſtaff: for you are to be a ſtaff to the weak and poor: it is of antient uſe in this kind. It's ſaid in Scripture, that</hi> the Scepter ſhall not depart from Judah. <hi>It was of like uſe in other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms:</hi> Homer <hi>the Greeke Poet calls Kings and Princes,</hi> Scepter-Bearers.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The laſt thing is</hi> a Sword, <hi>not a Military, but Civil Sword; it is a Sword rather of defence then offence; not to defend yourſelf onely, but others alſo. If I might preſume to fix a Motto upon this Sword, it ſhould be this:</hi> Ego ſum domini Protectoris, ad protegendum populum meum.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="315" facs="tcp:54215:161"/>
This Speech being ended, the Speaker took the Bible, and gave the Protector his Oath: afterwards, Mr. <hi>Manton</hi> made a prayer, wherein he recommended the Protector, Parliament, Council, the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by Land and Sea, Government, and people of the three Nations, to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of God. Which being ended, the Heralds by ſound of Trumpet proclaimed his Highneſs Protector of <hi>England, Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Dominions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto belonging: requiring all perſons to yeeld him due obedience. At the end of all, the Protector with his Train returned (a joyful man, no doubt) to White-Hall, and the Members to the Parliament-Houſe, where they prorogued their ſitting to the next <hi>January.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is no humane joy free from the mixture of ſome ſorrow; yea, many times it falleth out to be equivalent to (if not ſuperabounding) the joy it ſelf. So it fell out here: for though the Protector might rejoyce at this acquiſition of a Scepter, yet the death of General <hi>Blake</hi> (like a diſh of cold water caſt into the boyling Pot of his riſing fortunes) could do no leſs then mitigate the heat of it, and
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:54215:162"/>
cover the Courts countenance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with a Cypreſs Vail.</p>
               <p>This noble <hi>Blake</hi> in the beginning of <hi>Englands</hi> diſtractions, ſufficiently teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied a high reſolution, in his almoſt mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous defending of <hi>Lime</hi> and <hi>Taunton</hi> againſt the furie of Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> and the Lord <hi>Gorings</hi> Armies. Afterwards, the worth of this ineſtimable great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander being taken notice of in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they reſolved, it ſhould not long lie hid at home, but ſhew it ſelf abroad; and therefore he was advanced to be one of their Generals at Sea. At his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance into this Office, he pent up Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> in the chief Port of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,</hi> and hunted him from Sea to Sea, till he had reduced thoſe ſhips with him, which before had revolted from the Parliament.</p>
               <p>This was but petty Play, to after-La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours: For no ſooner did the quarrel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin between the two Re-publikes, <hi>England,</hi> and the United Provinces, but <hi>Blake</hi> was the firſt that reſiſted their arrogancie in the <hi>Downs;</hi> and ever after continued a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Vindicator of his Countreys Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, from the incroachments of inſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Neighbours. The laſt part he ever
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:54215:162"/>
acted in a Sea of blood, was againſt the <hi>Spaniards</hi> at <hi>Sancta Cruz;</hi> here with 25 Sail, he fought (as it were in a ring) with ſeven Forts, a Caſtle, and 16 ſhips, many of them being of greater force then moſt of thoſe ſhips <hi>Blake</hi> carryed in againſt them: yet in ſpite of oppoſition, he ſoon calcined the Enemy, and brought his Fleet back again to the Coaſt of <hi>Spain</hi> full fraught with honour. But what Commander is able to repel the ſtroaks of Death? This is he that doth conquer the Conquerours, and level the Honours of the mightieſt Monarchs with the meaneſt Captains: there is no withſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his force; for all muſt fall; <hi>Blake</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is compel'd to ſtrike the top-ſail and yeeld, now death hath got the weather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage of his craſie body; ſo that being no longer able to hold out, he expired at the entrance into <hi>Plymouth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was a man wholly devoted to his Countreys Service; reſolute in his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, and moſt faithful in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance: with him, valour ſeldom miſt its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, nor cowardize its puniſhment. When news was brought him of a metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoſis in the State at home, he would then
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:54215:163"/>
incourage the Sea-men to be moſt vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant abroad: for (ſaid he,) <hi>'Tis not our duty to minde State-Affairs, but to keep For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners from fooling us.</hi> In all his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditions, the wind ſeldom deceived him, but moſt an end ſtood his friend; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in his laſt undertaking at the <hi>Canary Iſlands.</hi> To his laſt, he lived a ſingle life, never being eſpouſed to any but his Countreys quarrels. As he lived bravely, he dyed gloriouſly, and was buryed in <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh's Chappel; yet enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at this time no other Monument, but what is reared by his Valour; which Time it ſelf can hardly deface.</p>
               <p>The Lord Protector having now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured his own Greatneſs, he thought it good to confer Titles of Honour upon his Children; and to that purpoſe ſent his Son <hi>Henry</hi> into <hi>Ireland</hi> with the Title of Lord Deputy. This young Gentleman in his Government ruled with ſo much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, that in ſmall time he had brought that diſordered Nation into the moſt hopeful condition of a flouriſhing State. But a grand Cataſtrophe afterwards fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon the <hi>Cromwels</hi> Government, his Authority reverted into the hands of a ſubſequent Parliament.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="309" facs="tcp:54215:163"/>
The time of the prorogation of the preſent Parliament being expired, the Members appeared again at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> the 20th of <hi>January</hi> 1657. and did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently receive into the Houſe their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Members which the Protector had before ſecluded from ſitting in the firſt Seſſion of this Parliament. This they did, upon the fourth Article of the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Advice, by which, <hi>no Members legally choſen, ſhould be excluded from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of their duty, but by conſent of Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this interval of the Parliaments ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, the Protector had provided his Peers which were to make up the other Houſe, who accordingly took Seats in the Lords Houſe: but with ſo much regret to the Houſe of Commons, whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion was quite changed from what it had been formerly, that now they would not own the work of their creation, but looked upon it as a by-blow, a thing by chance, or a Pageant Parliament ſet up on purpoſe to mock them. In this ſurly hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour the Protector let them run on for near a fortnight together; till at laſt they made his Highneſs wince with handling
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:54215:164"/>
his Prerogative-Royal; which he being not able to endure, in a fume flew from <hi>White-Hall</hi> to the Houſe of Lords; and having ſent for the Commons before him, he told them, <hi>That it concerned his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, as much as the Publike Peace and Tranquillity, to terminate this Parliament; and therefore he did now put an end to their ſitting.</hi> Thus he blew them away with a ſudden puff of winde from his mouth.</p>
               <p>But now comes into play a terrible Plot; no leſs place then <hi>London</hi> was to be fired, and in the hurly-burly of confuſion that it would make, muſt the Tower be taken, the Mews ſeized, and all the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers about the City be ſacrificed to the fury of—The Protector being well acquainted with theſe kinde of machinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, knew very well how to ſtifle them in the birth; and therefore he ſent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently for the Mayor, Aldermen and Common-Councel of the City of <hi>London,</hi> to forewarne them of the approaching danger, and to Commiſſionate their <hi>Militia</hi> to raiſe Forces for ſecurity of the City, and by their vigilancy to counter-plot theſe Plotters. Upon this, many perſons were apprehended, a High Court of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:54215:164"/>
erected, and Sir <hi>Henry Slingsby,</hi> Dr. <hi>Hewyt,</hi> Mr. <hi>Mordant,</hi> and many inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our fellows who were to have been Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders in the execution of this deſign, were brought to Trial. Sir <hi>Henry Slingsby</hi> and the Doctor were both condemned to looſe their Heads upon Tower-Hill; and ſix others (of the meaner ſort) were adjudged to be hanged, drawn and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered: but of theſe, onely three ſuffered: one in Tower-Street, another in Cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and the third before the Exchange in <hi>London.</hi> For the procuring of Sir <hi>Henry Slingsby</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hewyts</hi> Pardon, great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors were uſed: the Miniſters of <hi>London</hi> petitioned the Protector for the Doctors life, and many great perſons for the Knights: But the Protectors ears were deaf to all intreaties made in their behalf; ſo that nothing could ſatisfy his anger, but the lives of thoſe two conſiderable perſons.</p>
               <p>Prodigies in nature, as they are ſeldom ſeen, ſo when they happen, are ſure pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages and fore-tokens of alterations that ſhall fall out in the place where they do appear. At this time, <hi>June</hi> 2. 1658. ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived an ominous Whale in the River of
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:54215:165"/>
Thames, (not to do <hi>Homage to his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> (this was a fond conceit) as one would have it) but rather to forewarn him of his end (which not long after happened.) This fiſh, contrary to its nature, which is to return to Sea when it ſents the freſh wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, came ſwimming up the River againſt the tide as far as <hi>Greenwich,</hi> where it was taken, and found to be fifty eight foot in length, and every way proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Flanders</hi> being the Scoene of War, wherein the united Forces of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> did intend this Champaign to act mighty matters; in the beginning of <hi>May, D'Aumont</hi> a French Marſhal, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping to get a good bargain, turns Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, and trucks for <hi>Oſtend.</hi> Mony, as it over-turns all things, was at this time made uſe of to corrupt the Noble blood of the Souldiers of that Gariſon, and make them turn Traytors to this their truſt: but the ſequel will ſhew how far honeſty is above treachery. The Chief Factor that drove on this bargain, was one Colonel <hi>Spindeler:</hi> he having ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted the Governour of <hi>Calice</hi> that <hi>Oſtend</hi> was to be ſold, this Monſieurs
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:54215:165"/>
mouth preſently watered at the motion, and therefore acquaints the Court how a rich commodity was how offered to ſale at a cheap rate. The French Grandees pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently bite at the bait, little doubting the hook was daub'd over with this pretty pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, that the Governour, Magiſtrates and Citizens of <hi>Oſtend,</hi> being grieved at the Engliſh keeping their Coaſt blockt up with Ships, to rid themſelves of this continual trouble, they would rather be under <hi>France,</hi> then remain any longer in their preſent condition. This motion being made, they came to a price, and agreed upon a good round ſum of mony, which Marſhal <hi>D'Aumont</hi> was appointed to pay, and take poſſeſſion of the place at a time agreed on. He being well apaid in the imployment, ſlily ſlipt from <hi>Calice</hi> with three Ships fraught with Souldiers, and ſoon after fell in amongſt a Squadron of Engliſh Ships commanded by Vice-Admiral <hi>Goodſon,</hi> then lying near <hi>Oſtend.</hi> The Engliſh Commander ſeeing how confident theſe the Protectors Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates were in the deſign they went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, was willing to aſſiſt them with Sea-men, the better to facilitate their
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:54215:166"/>
landing. Whil'ſt <hi>D'Aumont</hi> was preparing to enter the Town according to agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> within (being a cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Nation where they take affection) were very active in making preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the entertainment of their French Gueſts: to this end, the Governour of <hi>Oſtend</hi> cauſed the Inhabitants to keep their Houſes, and not to ſtir from thence till they heard the Bells Ring in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Steeple: then the great Church, and Capuchin Friars Church, with many more ſecret places, were crowded with cluſters of Souldiers; theſe were to give the French a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fig at their landing. All things being in readineſs on both ſides, <hi>May</hi> the 4th in the morning, ſome of the French-men (that were before received into the Town) went out and invited their Countrey-men to come in. <hi>D'Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> upon this, and the ſight of white Colours placed upon the Walls, (for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coys,) did not in the leaſt diſtruſt, but took all to be gold that gliſter'd. Hereupon, the tide beginning to ſerve, about ten in the morning, four French Veſſels, a ſhip of <hi>Dover,</hi> and ſix or ſeven Boats from the Engliſh ſhips, ſailed into the Haven;
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:54215:166"/>
and preſently the French: landing upon the Keys, were in a triſe drawn up in Battalia. Upon this, certain Spaniſh Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers went to enquire for the money that was promiſed them: to which the French returned anſwer, That it was ready in one of their ſhips. This being<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as much as could be expected, the Officers returned into the Town again, and immediately ſhewed the French an <hi>a la mode</hi> trapanning trick; for the great Guns from two Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries (one of which was mounted with twelve, the other with eight,) let ſlie their murthering ſhot upon the poor French Foot; and to compleat their miſery, the Bells rung (as before appointed) which brought the Souldiers and Towns-men about their ears. The French now (when it was too late) ſeeing how hard a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain they were like to have, made ſome ſmall <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ir at the beginning: but finding it fruitleſs to reſiſt, they layd down their Arms, and ſubmitted on quarter. Thus much for the taking of <hi>Oſtend.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſlie <hi>Spaniard</hi> having thus ſlurred their Enemy, it raiſed in the French an unquenchable thirſt of revenge; and therefore to quit ſcores, the whole French
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:54215:167"/>
and Engliſh Armies joyned together, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving to wreak their wrath upon the Town of <hi>Dunkirk.</hi> This place may be called, <hi>The Key of Flanders,</hi> it being a Sea-Port-Town, and (of all men) beſt known to Engliſh Merchants, whoſe ſhips were frequently carryed prize into it. But now to put a <hi>finit</hi> to their infinite Loſſes, a formidable Siege was framed before it, which hotly alarm'd the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> in all their Quarters.</p>
               <p>Hereupon, <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi> takes theſe two things into ſerious conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: firſt, the importance of the place: for its Situation, it was a Key to <hi>Flanders,</hi> a frontier to <hi>France</hi> (next after <hi>Grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling)</hi> and a certain: ſupply of moneys, by continual booties brought in thither by his men of War. On the other ſide, ſhould he loſe <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> the Engliſh (in whoſe poſſeſſion it would be put) had a door opened, and fit opportunity to bid fair for all <hi>Flanders;</hi> here might an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my be landed from <hi>England,</hi> and from hence incurſions made to the Walls of <hi>Bruxels,</hi> Mean time, the Spaniſh Ports, <hi>Newport</hi> and <hi>Ostend,</hi> could expect no leſs then to be perpetually infeſted by men
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:54215:167"/>
of war; which would utterly ſpoyl their Trade, and ruine the Inhabitants: theſe and ſuch like conſiderations mounted <hi>Don John</hi> upon fixt reſolutions to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the relief of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> though it were to the hazard of his whole Army.</p>
               <p>Mean while, the Confederate Forces beleaguering this ſtrong place, did in a ſmall time (working like Moles) run their Trenches to the Spaniſh Counterſcarpe; and ſtill encroaching upon the Wall, they promiſed fair to a ſpeedy accompliſhment of their Deſign. Theſe things were well known to the Spaniſh Army, who now ſaw the relief of <hi>Dunkirk</hi> would admit of no delay; for were it not ſpeedily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, the Town of neceſſity muſt lie proſtrate to the Enemies mercie. The bettter to effect which therefore, <hi>Don John</hi> the Spaniſh General having drained his Gariſons to fill up his Army, ſuddenly advanced with 15000 men to the relief of his diſtreſſed friends; theſe by a ſwift march through <hi>Fuernes,</hi> quickly ſeated themſelves upon ſome ſandy Hills within an Engliſh mile and a half of <hi>Turine</hi> the French Generals Camp. The report of the Enemies near advance, made both
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:54215:168"/>
the French and Engliſh Officers conſult up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the beſt courſe that could be taken to repel the Force that now ſate upon their Skirts, indeavor to fruſtrate their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours in the preſent Siege, and render it fruitleſs. Time for conſultation being ſhort, (for it was on the over-night) they agreed unanimouſly to give the <hi>Spaniards</hi> the next morning a warm breakfaſt. All this night, the Officers of both Nations were very active to provide for the enſuing acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the Army being found ſufficient to fight a Field Battel, and at the ſame time to keep the beſieged from ranging abroad. For this ſervice moſt of the Engliſh were drawn from their entrenchment; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing joyned to the French Horſe, they marched againſt the Enemy. In the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both Armies being come near toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it was perceived, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> poſture was rather Defenſive then Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive: but the Engliſh Commanders know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was no time to dally, and being deſirous withall to ſhew the diſcipline of their own Country, (which is to make ſeeing and fighting all one) did preſently mount the Sand-Hills with a forſorn of three hundred Muſquetiers commanded
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:54215:168"/>
by Captain <hi>Devaux:</hi> after theſe followed that courageous Commander Lieutenant-Col. <hi>Fenwick,</hi> with the Lord General <hi>Lockharts</hi> Regiment. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that the reſolution of theſe men was by degrees to creep within them, did as highly reſolve to keep them off at the Armes end, by pouring down perpetual vollies of great and ſmall ſhot.</p>
               <p>General <hi>Lockhart</hi> knowing what: du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty belonged to his Office, did here ſhew the part of a noble Commander: for finding the French unwilling to enter, now the Engliſh had opened the gap; and on the other ſide, ſeeing the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry of his own Regiment, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they could no longer gain ground, yet ſtill kept their ſtation, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they were expoſed to the enemies aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults, he cauſed a conſiderable Brigade of freſh men to re-inforce thoſe that had firſt born the brunt of the Battle. This Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve (through Gen. <hi>Lockhart's</hi> care) coming in time to the relief of their tired fellows, made no long delay, but fell into the Spaniſh foot with the butt-end of their Muſquets; who not being able to withſtand their courage, left the Field,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:54215:169"/>
and fled towards <hi>Fuernes.</hi> The French Horſe ſeeing the good ſucceſs of the Engliſh Foot, did likewiſe make a charge upon the Spaniſh Cavalry, who being diſheartned with the routing of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry, thought it their ſafeſt courſe to run after them. But the French ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed excellent valour in purſuit: for the day being won, none durſt ſtand in their way: the poor <hi>Spaniards</hi> were ſadly handled by them, and hew'd down on all ſides. Being extreamly ſcatter'd in their flight, both the Engliſh and French were put to the trouble of gleaning for Priſoners, which at laſt were found to be 800 Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and about 2000 private Souldiers. How many were ſlain, is uncertain: for the Conquerours not being willing to looſe time in numbering them, made haſt hack again in triumph to their former ſiege.</p>
               <p>To particularize in ſetting forth the gallantry thus expreſſed on the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh ſide in this encounter, would cauſe me to exceed my wonted brevity: let it therefore ſuffice to give an inſtance thereof in the perſonal valour of two on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; <hi>viz.</hi> Col. <hi>ſones,</hi> and Major General
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:54215:169"/>
                  <hi>Drummond</hi> a Scotch-man, who were moſt eminent therein: theſe two Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men came at firſt to <hi>Dunkirk</hi> only to ſatisfy their curioſity; but this fight hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the time of their ſtay, it raiſed in them a noble reſolution to be no longer idle Spectators, but brave partakers in their Country-mens labors. For Col. <hi>Jones</hi> his part, he at the firſt onſet charged on foot with Lieutenant-Colonel <hi>Fenwick;</hi> and after mounting a Horſe, fell ſo deſperately on the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that being too far en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged amongſt them, he was made their Priſoner; but afterwards being exchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Protector made him Knight and Baronet in recompence of his valour. Major General <hi>Drummond's</hi> ſpirit being little inferiour to the beſt in the Field, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved himſelf with much bravery; which was ſo much the more, by how much the leſs he was concerned in the Quarrel; no obligation inducing him to venture his life, except it were the preſent engagement of ſome friends that bound him (through re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to them) to partake of their dangers; which afterwards proved his own death: for in the beginning of the fight, his Horſe was ſhot under him; and preſently after,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:54215:170"/>
having mounted a ſecond, he was by an unhappy puſh of a Pike diſmounted again; yet ſtill proſecuting the ſervice more then minding his own ſafety, he received a deſperate wound that brought him to the grave.</p>
               <p>But now to return: The Army having vanquiſhed the Relievers, did renew their attempts with extraordinary vigor upon the Town of <hi>Dunkirk.</hi> The Marqueſs <hi>de Leda</hi> (Governour thereof) ſeeing how hardly he was beſet, could not contain himſelf within the narrow compaſs of his own Walls, but having a deſire to beat up the French mens Quarters, he ſuddenly ſallied out of the Town with a ſtrong Party; but alas, all proved to no purpoſe; the Fates cannot be withſtood: neither was he free from errour in the attempt. For as if in a natural body (upon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of danger) the vital ſpirits retire to the heart, life is preſerved; but if they forſake that, and depart to the extremities, death enſues: ſo this <hi>Don</hi> (being the life of the reſt, as indeed all Generals and Governours are to their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies or Gariſons) ſallying out in perſon (that ſhould have been encouraging thoſe
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:54215:170"/>
in the Town) procured his own death; and the miſcarriage of his deſign; therein ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more valour then diſcretion. For up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his death, a cold damp ſeized upon the <hi>Dunkirkers,</hi> who ſeeing what prodigious Balls of fire were flung out of the Engliſh Morter Pieces into the Town, were ſore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly terrified thereby; and ſo much the more, in regard of their not being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to ſuch ſtratagems; his Holineſs the Pope having prohibited the uſe of Granado's amongſt his Catholikes, to prevent burning of Churches. Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring therefore that the longer they ſtood out, the harder would be their termes; And ſeeing all hope of relief by Land was loſt, the Sea ſecured againſt them, and daily diſcouragements ariſing every way; therefore, to prevent further inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> deſired a preſent Capitulation; which being eaſily granted, it was agreed that the Town ſhould be ſurrendered upon theſe following Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Town ſhould be yeelded up, with all the great Guns, their ſtores of Victuals, Magazine of Arms and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition,
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:54215:171"/>
without any imbezelment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Officers and Souldiers to march out with Drums beating, Colours flying, two Pieces of Ordnance, and their Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>That they ſhould have the liberty to march with a Convoy to conduct them to S.</hi> Omers.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The Inhabitants to remain indemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in their Perſons and Goods, and to enjoy their former Customs and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges for two years, and not to be molested touching the exerciſe of their Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Articles being ratified by the King of <hi>France;</hi> this ſtrong Town of <hi>Dunkirk</hi> was delivered up into the hands of the Engliſh, by the King of <hi>France</hi> and Cardinal in Perſon, upon Tueſday, <hi>June</hi> 25. 1658. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> at the ſame time quitting it, there marched out one thouſand horſe and foot; and ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred more, that had been wounded in the ſiege, followed after, as their ſtrength gave them leave: The Engliſh having poſſeſſion of the Town, found in it 140 great Guns, all Braſs except eight, with Ammunition and Proviſion ſufficient to
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:54215:171"/>
maintain it for a great while longer then it was kept.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Naisby</hi> Frigat riding Admiral of the Engliſh Fleet in <hi>Dunkirk</hi> road, at that time when the Town was delivered up, Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi>'s curioſity was whetted with reports of this ſtately Ship, inſomuch that he deſired to give her a viſit: which General <hi>Mountague</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtanding, he invited the Cardinal and other French Lords aboard: they all moſt readily accepted of it, and returned many complements (which the French are never unprovided of) for the ſingular favour of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them. The time appointed being come, the Cardinal in his Pontificali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, with a great Train of Noble-men, went in Boats, to ſee the Ship: at his lanching forth, the Engliſh Frigats, in the braveſt equipage they poſſibly could be put, ſaluted him with the roaring noiſe of great Guns, ſo continuing firing as he paſt by them. Approaching near the <hi>Naiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,</hi> the Engliſh General with many Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and Gentlemen met him in their Boats, and conducted him aboard. His Eminency and the reſt being landed in this floating Iſland, the General treated
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:54215:172"/>
them with a noble Banquet, at which the Cardinal ſhewed ſo much abſtemiouſneſs, that of all the varieties provided for his entertainment, he taſted little, and onely drank of Rheniſh Wine: afterwards Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Montague</hi> ſhewed him all the parts and places of this excellent ſhip; which ſo highly pleaſed the Cardinal, that he proteſted, <hi>Of all the ſights he ever ſaw, none in his life pleaſed him like this.</hi> With this great ſatisfaction he returned again to the Shore; and as at his comming, (for a welcome) ſo again at his departure, all the Men of War gave him their broad ſides for a farewel.</p>
               <p>The yeer gliding thus away in Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Triumphs, <hi>Dunkirk</hi> inforc'd to grow under the ſhade of the Engliſh Oake, and all proſpering ſo well in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> as if <hi>Mars</hi> himſelfe had born the Engliſh Banners, cauſed endearing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulations mutually to paſs between the <hi>Protector</hi> and his <hi>Cozens</hi> of <hi>France.</hi> The Lord <hi>Fawconbridge</hi> being made one of the blood by Matrimony, carryed the firſt complement to <hi>Calice,</hi> and there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented it to the King; which was quickly after returned back again by Monſieur
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:54215:172"/>
                  <hi>Mancini</hi> nephew to Cardinal <hi>Mazarine,</hi> and the Duke <hi>de Crequi:</hi> theſe arrived at <hi>London</hi> to preſent their reſpects; which having done, they returned with high ſatisfaction. Theſe being departed, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother far-leſs-welcom Meſſenger arrived at the Engliſh Court, even Death it ſelf, who came to require of our great <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi> what was his due by Nature. Him no Arguments can perſwade, nor Policies evade: here Prayers and Tears prevail not, neither can money bribe him: Promiſes of Preferment ſignifie nothing, with him; for he lays all earthly Honour in the duſt. His fatal Sickle cuts down all.</p>
               <p>The firſt Symptomes of this great mans laſt ſickneſs, appeared preſently upon the death of his Daughter <hi>Cleypole;</hi> whoſe end is thought by many to have haſtened his diſſolution. About the beginning of <hi>October,</hi> his diſtemper diſcovered it ſelf to be an Ague; which conſpiring with a combination of other malignant diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, ſo depreſſed his vitals, that he fell into many Trances, before his final <hi>exit;</hi> the intervals of which (wherein he gained ſome repoſe) he ſpent in conferences with Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> Dr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> and ſeveral other
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:54215:173"/>
Divines, and with his Privie Counſellors; with theſe, about the Succeſſion here; with the other, about his own poſſeſſion here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. To ſucceed him in the Protectorſhip he appointed his eldeſt Son <hi>Richard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the evening before his departure, he was heard to pray thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lord, I am a miſerable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet I am in Covenant with thee through grace; and I may, I will come unto thee for thy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Lord, thou haſt made me (though very unworthy) a mean Inſtrument to do them ſome good, and thee ſervice; and many of them had too high value of me, though others would be glad of my fall: but Lord, howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thou diſpoſeſt of me, do good for them. Give conſiſtencie of
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:54215:173"/>
Judgment, one heart, and mutual love unto them. Let the name of Chriſt be glorious through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the world. Teach thoſe who look with much affection to thy Inſtrument, to depend more upon thee. Pardon ſuch as delight to trample upon the aſhes of a worm: for they are thy people too: And Pardon the folly of this ſhort Prayer, even for Jeſus Chriſt his ſake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Afterwards his ſickneſs violently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing upon him, it ſeparated his ſoul from his body on Friday the third of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi> 1658. near three of the clock in the afternoon: death then became a Conquerour, and overcame him, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had vanquiſhed the Scotch Armies twice on the ſame day of the year.</p>
               <p>The Corpſe, preſently after his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration, being embalmed, and wrapped up
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:54215:174"/>
in a Sheet of Lead, was on the twenty ſixt of <hi>September,</hi> about ten at night, private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly removed from <hi>White-Hall</hi> in a mourning Herſe, attended by his domeſtick Servants to <hi>Somerſet-Houſe,</hi> where it remained in private for ſome days, till all things were in readineſs for publike view; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accompliſhed, his Effigies was with great ſtate &amp; magnificence expoſed openly; multitudes daily flocking to ſee the ſight, which appeared in this order. The firſt room where the Spectators entered, was wholly hung with black; at the upper end whereof, was placed a Cloath and Chair of State: In like manner, was the ſecond and third rooms, all having Scutcheons very thick upon the Walls, and Guards of Partizans placed in each room for people to paſs through. The fourth room was compleatly hung with black Velvet, the Ceiling being of the ſame: here lay the Effigies, with a large Canopy of black Velvet fringed, which hung over it. The Waxen Picture lying upon it's back, was apparel'd in a rich Suit of Velvet, robed in a little Robe of Purple-Velvet, laced with a rich gold Lace, and furr'd with Ermins: upon the Kirtle was a large Robe
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:54215:174"/>
of Purple-Velvet, laced and furr'd as the former, with rich ſtrings and taſſels of gold. The Kirtle was girt with a rich em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broydered Belt, wherein was a Sword bravely guilt and hatched with gold, which hung by the ſide of this <hi>fine thing.</hi> In the right hand was a Scepter, in the left a Globe; upon his head was placed a Purple-Velvet Cap furr'd with Ermines, ſutable to the Robes: behind the head, was placed a rich Chair of Tiſſued Gold, whereon was placed an Imperial Crown, which lay high, that the people might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it. The Bed of State whereon he lay, was covered with a large Pall of black Velvet, under which was a Holland ſheet, borne up by ſix ſtools covered with Cloath of gold. About the Bed was placed a compleat ſuit of Armes, and at the feet of the Effigies ſtood his Creſt. This bed had fixt about it an Aſcent of two ſteps; a little from thence ſtood eight ſilver Candleſticks about five foot high; with white wax Tapers ſtanding in them, of three foot long. All theſe things were environed with Rails and Ballaſters four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſquare, covered with Velvet; at each corner whereof there was erected an
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:54215:175"/>
upright Pillar, which bore on their tops Lions and Dragons, who held in their Paws Streamers crowned. On both ſides of the Bed were ſet up in ſockets, four great Standards of the Protectors Armes, with Banners and Banrols of War, painted upon Taffaty. About the Bed ſtood men in Mourning bare-headed; and without the Rails, others to receive people in, and turn them out again.</p>
               <p>When this Shew had been ſeen for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny weeks together, the Scoene was then altered; the Efſigies being removed into another room, it was there ſet up, ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon an Aſcent under a Cloath of State; being veſted as it was before, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: onely now his Purple-Velvet Cap was changed for a Crown. In the ſame manner as formerly, were men waiting upon him bare-headed. In this poſture he continued until the 23 of <hi>November,</hi> which day was appointed to carry him with all ſolemnity to <hi>Weſtminſter Abby.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This great Funeral was performed with very great Majeſty, in this manner fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. All things being in readineſs, the Waxen Picture of the Protector (with a Crown on his head, a Sword by his ſide,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:54215:175"/>
a Globe and Scepter in his Hands) was taken down from his ſtanding, and laid in an open Chariot, covered all over with black Velvet, adorned with Plumes and Scurcheons, and drawn by ſix Horſes in black Velvet. The Streets from <hi>Somerſet-Houſe to Weſtminſter-Abby,</hi> were guarded by Souldiers in new Red Coats and black Buttons, with their Enſigns wrapt in Cypres: which made a Lane to keep off Spectators from crouding the Actors.</p>

                  <p>In the firſt place went a Marſhal atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by his deputy, and thirteen more on horſeback, to clear the way: after him followed the poor men of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> by two and two, in Mourning Gowns and Hoods: next to them, the ſervants of thoſe Perſons of quality that attended the Funeral. Theſe were followed by the Protectors late domeſtick ſervants, with his Barge-men and Water-men. Then came the ſervants of the Lord Mayor and Sheriffs of <hi>London.</hi> Following them, were Gentlemen Attendants on Forraign Ambaſſadors and publike Miniſters. After

marched the poor Knights of <hi>Windſor</hi> in Gowns and Hoods: then the Clerks, Secretaries, and Officers of the Army, Admiralty, Treaſury, Navie, and Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer: next, the Commiſſioners of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, of the Army, and Committee of the Navie.

               <p>In his riſe, he never cut down one ſtep before another was built to ſupport him: this was ſeen in his levelling the <hi>Long Parliament,</hi> and preſent ſpring of the next <hi>Little One:</hi> then, they being diſſolved, in comes an <hi>Inſtrument</hi> for his own <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> In all theſe changes, he took time by the foretop, not ſuffering ſuch an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terregnum</hi>
                  <pb n="349" facs="tcp:54215:178"/>
as might encourage the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples minds to work him any miſchief.</p>
               <p>His Speeches were for the moſt part am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous, eſpecially in publike meetings; wherein he rather left others to pick out the meaning, then did it himſelf. But when Offenders came under his own examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then would he ſpeak plain Engliſh, and declare his power unto them in a rant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtile.</p>
               <p>Secrecie in carrying on Deſigns, is the principal part of a Prince: at this he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, both in Military and Civil Affairs; inſomuch that few actions ever miſcarried under his hands, except that grand one of <hi>Sancta Domingo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They that go about to diminiſh his Valour, do little leſs then rob him of his right: for in the Camp his Armor depreſt fear, and made him ſtand in defiance of all Guns under the Demie-Cannon; but at Court, his courage was ſomewhat quai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with a new light ſprung up, called, <hi>Killing no Murther.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Pride and Ambition which ſome ſay he was guilty of, may be eaſily excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as an original ſin inherent in nature: and we all know, <hi>That which is born in the
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:54215:179"/>
bone, will never out of the fleſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude, he carryed his Deſign clear, and hit the mark he aim'd at, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Parliament, <hi>Triplo-Heath</hi> and <hi>Dunbars</hi> Ingagements: which ſhews, that <hi>Policy</hi> and <hi>Piety</hi> may both lie in a bed, and yet not touch one another. But now we mention <hi>Pietie,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Religion muſt not paſs my Pen; in this he was zealous, not altogether like the Phariſee, that prayed in the Temple; but really often would he mourn in ſecret, and many times did his eyes in publike di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtil tears at the Nations ſtubbornneſs.</p>
               <p>To take him in the whole, he was a <hi>Man</hi> better fitted to make a <hi>Prince</hi> of, then the <hi>People</hi> was to <hi>receive him:</hi> this we ſee ſufficiently in the management of the Government to his Death. But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, the ſudden diſaſter which befel his <hi>Poſterity</hi> was ſo <hi>admirable,</hi> that it cannot be imputed to any thing elſe but</p>
