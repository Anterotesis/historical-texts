         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

he might iustly die for it. The other did intreat as ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly,

sinned, and prouoked his indignation to strike vs: yea,
euen his Mercie we haue abused. For her sake we haue
been spared, and a longer day of repentance giuen vs:
yet we haue despised the riches of this Mercie; and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming

Iustice pleades to God that we should die;
vrgeth his Law: <hi>Who so euer sinneth, shall die:</hi> And, <hi>Death
is the wages of sinne.</hi> Mercie intreats beseecheth, that wee
may liue; and produceth the Gospell, <hi>Who so euer repents,
shall be pardoned: Who so euer beleeues, shall be saued:</hi> And
for further assurance, brings foorth that blessed Pardon,
sealed in the Wounds and Blood of <hi>Iesus</hi> Christ. God
hearkens to Mercie for his Sonnes sake: though wee
haue rauished and wronged his Mercie; yet for Mercies
sake, we shall be forgiuen. But then we must be marryed

                     <p>There is one amongst vs that is a terrible <hi>Binder;</hi> and
that's the vsurer. Hee <hi>Binds</hi> strangely, strongly, with
the <hi>Cordes</hi> of obligations. You know he that enters into

knots: his profession is <hi>Cordage.</hi> And for this cause he is
belou'd of the <hi>Cord</hi>-makers, for setting them on worke;
and of no body else.</p>
                     <p>This fellow <hi>Bindes,</hi> but he'l neare <hi>Bind the Sacrifice:</hi>
his conscience shall be loose enough. I could say much
to this <hi>Binder,</hi> if there were any hope of him. But I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
a true story, that a friend told me of an Vsurer.
There was a Godly Preacher in his Parish, that did
beate downe with all iust conuictions, and honest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofes
that sinne. Many Vsurers flocked to his Church,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:524:17"/>
because he was a man of note. Among the rest, this Vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
did bid him often to dinner, and vsed him very kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Not long after this Preacher began to forbeare Vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie;
not in any conniuence or partiallitie; but because
he had dealt plentyfully with it; and now his Text led
him not to it.</p>
                     <p>Now begins the Vsurer to be heauy, sorrowing and
discontent; And turned his former kindnesse into ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lennesse.
The Preacher must needs obserue it, and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
asked him the reasons of this sodaine auersion. The
Vsurer replyed. If you had held on your first Course to
in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e put all the Vsurers downe; and so I should haue
had the better Vent and Custome for my Mony. For
my part, say what you will, I neuer meant to leaue it:
But I should haue been beholding to you, if you could
haue made me an Vsurer alone. You see the hope of an
Vsurers Conuersion.</p>
                     <p>But I would to God, that euery one thus bound with
the <hi>Corde</hi> of his Wickednesse, would consider, that so
long as a <hi>Corde</hi> is whole, it is not easily broken: but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twist
it, &amp; lay it threed by threed, and you my quickly
snappe it a sunder. Beloued, first vntwine the <hi>Corde</hi> of
your sinnes by serious consideration, and then you
may easily breake them off by Repentance.</p>

<hi>Sacrifice,</hi> 4. but not to the <hi>Altar.</hi> There are many of

                     <p>These <hi>Bind the Sacrifice,</hi> and with <hi>Cordes;</hi> but not to

There is a pretty Fable, the morall of it will
profitably fitte our present Discourse. A Serpent acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally
inclosed, betwixt two great Stones, that hee
could no way es extricate himselfe; made his moane to
a man passing by to deliuer him. The man with much
force remooued the Stone, and set him free. The Serpent
now, feeling his libertie, thus bespake his deliuerer. I
confesse, you haue done mee a kindnesse in helping me
out, being almost famished: But now I am out, my hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
is so violent, that I must needes take the benefite of
my fortune, and deuoure you. The man vrged his <hi>Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude;</hi>
but to no purpose, for the Serpent would eate
him. Instantly hee spied an Asse comming, and desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the Serpent to put it to his iudgement. The Serpent
was contented, knowing that the Asse durst not but
condemne the man for his prey, least hee endangered
himselfe. The case was pleaded on both sides; the Man
vrging his kindnesse, the Serpent his hunger: But the
Asse gaue iudgement on the Serpents side; who is now
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:524:23"/>
ready to set on the Man. Hereupon flyes by an Eagle,
to whom the Man appealed for Iudgement in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie.
The Eagle hearing the cause debated, deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of the Serpent, if hee could haue freed himselfe,
without the mans ayde? The Serpent answered affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely,
and sayd, it was onely his policie, by this tricke
to get the Man within his reach. The Eagle desires to
see the place: the Man shewes it. The Eagle bids the
Serpent goe into the hole againe for more certaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration.
The Serpent doth so; and the Man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooues
the other Stone, as it was before, and reinclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
the Serpent. The Eagle now bids the Serpent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer
himselfe: Hee replied, hee could not. Then (quoth
the Eagle) this is my iudgement: The next time the
Man lets thee foorth, doe thou take him for thy prey,
and eate him.</p>
                     <p>It cannot be denyed, but wee were once surer in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans
hold, then this Serpent is imagin'd to be betweene
the Stones. The <hi>Man</hi> Christ <hi>Iesus</hi> in pittie redeemed
vs, and gaue vs libertie: Wee are no sooner out, but we
fall to deuoure him; to make his poore members, his
poore Ministers our Prey; to wound his Name with
Blasphemies, to steale his Goods with Sacriledge; and

                           <hi>Hunting,</hi> in it selfe, is a delight lawfull and lawdable:
and may well be argued for, from the disposition that
God hath put into creatures. Hee hath naturally incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
one kind of Beastes to pursue another, for mans
profite and pleasure. Hee hath giuen the Dogge a secret
instinct to follow the Hare, the Hart, the Foxe, the Bore:
as if hee would direct a man by the finger of Nature to
exercise those qualities, which his diuine Wisedome
created in them.</p>
                        <p>There is no Creature but may teach a good soule one
step toward his Creator. The World is a Glasse, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

When <hi>Salomon</hi> had found men pulling on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
vnnecessary vexations in this world, and yet not

hee concludes: <hi>Then I commended Mirth,</hi>

                           <hi>because a

Nothing is <hi>Magis proprium materiae,</hi> (say Philosophers)
more proper to matter, then to flow; <hi>nisi a forma sistitur,</hi>

so long vse it on sufferance, that at last they plead Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription,

them to habituall Practises. Therefore <hi>Salomon</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes

denounceth a <hi>Vae ridentibus,</hi> for they that will laugh,

                        <p>Wee often read Christ weeping, neuer laughing: ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
his creatures for sustentation, not for recreation.
Indeed hee afforded vs this benefite; and what wee had
lost, as it were <hi>ex postliminio,</hi> recouered to vs. But it were
strange, that <hi>Haeres succedens in defuncti locum,</hi> should doe
more, then the Testator euer did himselfe, or allowed
by his graunt: Or that Seruants and Sinners should
challenge that, which was not permitted to their Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster

as the Pharises did the Law, <hi>in sensum reprobum.</hi> These

                        <p>Benefite. Recreations haue also their profitable vse,
if rightly vndertaken.</p>
                        <p>1. The Health is preserued by a moderate Exercise.

                        <p>It appeares, that <hi>Esaus</hi> delight was not to surprise
tame Beastes, that did him seruice; but wilde: For, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the former, there needed no such <hi>cunning.</hi> How
easily is the Oxe brought to the Yoake, the Horse to
the Bitte, the Lambe to the Slaughter? His intention and
contention was against wild and noxious creatures.</p>
                        <p>This Obseruation teacheth vs to doe no violence to
the Beastes, that serue vs. <hi>Salomon</hi> stampes this Marke
on the good mans Fore-head, that <hi>hee is mercifull to his

of the Oxe should not be mussled, that treadeth out the Corne.</hi>
God opened the mouth of an Asse to reprooue the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of <hi>Balaam;</hi> who strucke her vndeseruedly for not
going forward, when Gods Angell stood <hi>ad oppositum.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Those sports are then intollerable, wherein we vexe
those Creatures, that spend their strengths for our bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites.
God therefore often iustly suffers them to know
their owne power, and to reuenge themselues on our
ingratitude. The <hi>Romane</hi> Southsayers diuined; that
when Bulles, Dogges, and Asses, (Beastes created for
vse and obedience) grew madd on a sodaine, <hi>Bellum ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile
imminebat,</hi> it boded some seruile Warre and Insur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.
But wee may truly gather, that when God
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:524:30"/>
suffers these seruiceable and domesticall Creatures, to
make Mutenie and Rebellion against vs; that God is
angry with our sinnes: and that they no otherwise
shake off our seruice, then wee haue shaken off the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
of God. So long as wee keepe our Couenant with
the Lord, he makes a League for vs, with the Beastes of
the field: but when wee fall from our Aleagiance, they
fall from theirs; and (without wonder) quit our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
against God, with their Rebellion against vs.
Wee see what wee get by running from our Maister;
wee loose our Seruants.</p>
                        <p>But if they that flie from God by Contempt, shall
thus speed, What shall become of them that flie vpon
God by Contumacie? If wicked <hi>Nabal</hi> could blame the
Seruants, <hi>qui fugiunt Dominos,</hi> that run from their Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters;
how would he condemne them, <hi>qui persequuntur,</hi>
that run vpon them with violence? But if we band our
selues against God, hee hath his Hostes to fight against
vs. Fowles in the ayre, Fishes in the sea, Beastes on the
earth, Stones in the street, will take his part against vs.
So long doth the Henne clocke her Chickens, as shee
takes them to be hers: but if they flie from the defence
of her Winges, she leaues them to the prey of the Kite.
So long as wee obey GOD, Heauen and Earth shall
obey vs; and euery Creature shall doe vs seruice: But if
we turne Outlawes to him, wee are no longer in the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of his gracious custodie and protection.</p>

                        <p>AS <hi>Cunning</hi> as hee was to take Beastes, hee had litle
cunning to saue himselfe. How foolish was hee, to
part with his Birthright for a messe of Lentile Pottage?
And since there is a necessary discussion of his Folly,
as well as of his <hi>Cunning,</hi> I will take here iust occasion

appeares by three phrases he vsed.<note place="margin">ver. 30.</note> 1. <hi>Feed mee, I pray
thee;</hi> Satisfie, saturate, satiate mee: or, let mee swallow
at once, as some read it: The words of an appetite in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufferable

the word for haste: <hi>With that Red,</hi> with that <hi>Red</hi>
Pottage. <hi>Red</hi> was his colour, <hi>Red</hi> his desire: Hee coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Red</hi> Pottage, hee dwelt in a <hi>red</hi> soyle; called thereon,
<hi>Idumea:</hi> and in the Text, <hi>Therefore was his name called

<hi>to die,</hi> if I haue it not: Like some longing soules, that
haue so weake a hand ouer their appetites, that they

                        <p>1. That Intemperance is not onely a filthy, but a foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
sinne. It is impossible, that a rauenous Throate
should lie neere a sober Braine: There may be in such a
man, vnderstanding and reason; but he neither heares
that, nor followes this. A Citie may haue good Lawes,
though none of them be kept. But as in sleepers and

Wherewith Diuines hold, that the Priesthood was also
conueyed. The Father of the Family exercised it du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

without any interception of Sorrow, or interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

Customes; and not his Birthrights losse can put
him out of them. A circular thing implies a perpetuitie
of motion, according to Mathematicians. It begins
from all parts alike, <hi>et in seipso definit,</hi> endes absolutely
in it selfe, without any poynt or scope obiectuall to

of an heauenly Birthright, then if hee had missed the
Deare hee hunted. It is wicked to sell Heauenly things
at a great rate of Worldly: but it is most wretched to
vilipend them.</p>

as the <hi>Septuagint</hi> call him, <hi>A Field-man,</hi> in regard that
hee was continually conuersant in the Field: There
was his sport, there was his heart. Therefore (ver. 28.)
<hi>did Isaac loue Esau, because he did eate of his Venison:</hi> Hee
loued his Venison, not his Conditions. Some would

no Beast hunts the owne kind to deuoure it. Now
if these should prosecute Wolues, Foxes, &amp;c. they

should then <hi>hunt</hi> their owne kind: for they are these

<hi>Homo homini Lupus.</hi> But though they are Men they <hi>hunt,</hi>
and by nature of the same kind; they are not so by qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie:
For they are Lambes they persecute: In them
there is Blood, and Flesh, and Fleece, to be had: and
therefore on these doe they gorge themselues. In them
there is weake Armour of defence against their cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
therefore ouer these they may domineere. I will
speake it boldly: There is not a mighty <hi>Nimrod</hi> in this

Lambe hee insultes, like a young <hi>Nero.</hi> Let him be
graced by High ones, and hee must not be saluted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

Philosophers hold the world to be composed of three
concurrent principles, Matter, Forme, and Priuation:
holding the last, to be rather a principle of Transmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
then of Establishment. Oppressours besides the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:524:40"/>
Matter, which is the Common-wealth; and the Forme
which is Iustice; haue deuised to make necessarie also
Priuation.</p>
                        <p>There are sinnes, which striue onely <hi>Intra orbem suum
<unclear>urere</unclear>:</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Sen.</note> which haue no further latitude then the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the Committer: They are Priuate and Domesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
sinnes: the sting whereof dies in the proprietary.
Such are Prodigality, Enuie, Sloth, Pride. Though euill
example may doe somewhat, they haue no further ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.
But some are of so wild a nature, that they are
Mallets and Swords to the whole Country about them.
And these are districtly, the sinnes of the Hand. So
Micah. 2.<note place="margin">Mic 2. 2.</note> 
                           <hi>They couet Fieldes, and take them by Violence: and
Houses, and tÃ ke them away: so they Ã²ppresse a man and his
house, euen a man and his Heritage.</hi> Why doe they all this,
but because <hi>Manus potest.</hi> ver. 1. <hi>It is in the power of their
Hand.</hi> And they measure their power, sayth <hi>Seneca,</hi> by
the Span,<note place="margin">De Benef. lib. 1.</note> by the reach of their Hands. <hi>Iniurijs vires me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuntur.
Anaxagoras</hi> thought man the wisest of all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
because he hath Handes, whereby he can expresse
all signes. He might haue concluded him the Wickedest
of all Creatures, <hi>quia manuatus,</hi> because he hath Hands.
For no Tyger or Vulture vnder Heauen is more hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
with his Clawes and Tallents, then Man with his
Hands. <hi>Achilles</hi> asked <hi>Palamedes</hi> going to the <hi>Troyan</hi>
Warres, Why hee went without a Seruant? Hee shewed
him his hands, and told him they were <hi>Loco seruorum,</hi>
in stead of many seruants. <hi>Manus organum organorum.</hi>
Their dexteritie and aptnesse chargeth them with
sinnes, whereof the other parts are no lesse Guilty.</p>
                        <p>For the most part, those Beasts haue least immanitie
that haue most strength. Oxen and Horses and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants
are tame and seruicable, but Bees and Hornets
haue Stings. So wisely hath the Creator disposed, that
there may not be a Coniunction <hi>et Potentiae et Maleuolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae:</hi>
that might and malice may not meete. So they are
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:524:41"/>
suffered to haue Will to hurt, &amp; not Power; or Power,
and not will. The curst Cow hath short Hornes: But
these <hi>Hunters</hi> haue got both. The Poet sayth:

not, is <hi>laus tua,</hi> thy prayse: that thou wouldest and canst
not, <hi>gratia Dei,</hi> is Gods prouidence. <hi>Haman</hi> would hang
<hi>Mordecai</hi> and cannot: hee is a villaine in Hell for his
intent. <hi>Dauid,</hi> when hee had <hi>Saul</hi> in the Caue, could
hurt and would not: hee is a Saint in Heauen. <hi>Shimei</hi>
would, but can not kill (though rayle on) <hi>Dauid: Dauid</hi>
can, and will not kill <hi>Shimei.</hi> The hote Disciples would
haue Fire from Heauen to destroy the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> and
could not: Christ could commaund it, and would not.

Hee wasteth Societies, Communitie, Neighbourhood

Hee is a bloody Boare, and hath two damnable Tuskes:
Money to make him Friendes, and to charme conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uence:
And a wicked Conscience, that cares not to

Boare, whereby hee beares off all blowes of Curses, is
the securitie of his owne dead Heart: Hee thinkes the
Cryes and Vlulations of Widdowes and Orphans, the

                  <p>1. Whether this <hi>Starre</hi> were singular, or an heape of
<hi>Starres.</hi> Our <hi>Romane</hi> aduersaries, to bring wilfull trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
on themselues and vs, haue coniur'd a fiction from
one <hi>Albumazar</hi> a Heathen; that the Signe in the Zodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acke,
call'd the <hi>Virgin,</hi> is composed of so many <hi>Starres,</hi>
as may aptly pourtray <hi>Virginem gestantem inter brachia
filium,</hi> a Virgin bearing an Infant in her armes: And
some of them haue thought that, this <hi>Starre.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let <hi>Albumazar</hi> be the father of this opinion; and
for a litle better authoritie, they haue motherd it on a
Prophecie of <hi>Tiburtine Sibylla</hi> when <hi>Augustus</hi> boasted his
super-humane Maiestie, <hi>Sibylla</hi> shewed him <hi>Virginem in
coelo Infanti portam,</hi> a Virgin in Heauen bearing a young
Child in her armes; with these wordes: <hi>Hic Puer maior
te est, ipsum adora,</hi> Yonder Infant is greater then thou
art, <hi>O Cesar,</hi> worship him.</p>
                  <p>But because the Father of this toy was an Ethnicke,
and the Mother thought a Sorceresse, they haue (as
somethinke, spight of his teeth) brought in <hi>Chrysostome</hi>

for a God-father to it; or to an opinion, if differing
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:524:47"/>
from it, yet also exceeding the truth of this Historie.
Whether of himselfe, or on their teaching, he sayes thus.
<hi>This Starre appeared to them descending vpon that victoriall
Mountaine, hauing in it the forme of a little Child; and aboue
him the similitude of a Crosse.</hi> But I confesse, (and loe the
great vaunts of their vnitie) that many of them are of
another minde.</p>

You plead, God cares not for our Sheepe and Oxen, or
the fatte of our Rammes: for all the World is his. Hee
requires it not for himselfe, though due to himselfe.

would neuer be out of, Charitie. Most men now-a-dayes
(as it is in the Prouerbe) are better at the Rake,
then at the Pitch-forke; readier to pull in, then giue out.
But if the Lord hath sowne plentifull Seed, hee expects
plentifull Fruites; an answerable measure, heapen, and
shaken, and thrust togeather, and running ouer. If God
hath made the Bushell great, make not you the Pecke
small. Turne not the bountie of Heauen, to the scarcity

                     <p>3. Lastly, thou must giue thy <hi>Gold</hi> also: a pure <hi>Heart,</hi>
tryed in the Furnace of Affliction and sublim'd from all
corruption. And because God onely knowes the Heart,
and the World must iudge by thy Fruites; giue thy spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
<hi>Gold</hi> to <hi>Christ,</hi> and thy temporall <hi>Gold</hi> to his poore
members. Here take with thee three Cautions.</p>
                     <p>1. That all these <hi>Gifts</hi> be deriued from an honest
Heart. It is said of these <hi>Magi, They opened their Treasurs,
and presented vnto him Gifts.</hi> Mans Heart is his <hi>Treasurie:</hi>
thou must open that, when thou presentest any <hi>Gift</hi> to
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:524:55"/>
the Lord. He that comes with an open Hand, and a shut
Heart, shall be answerd of God, as <hi>Belshazzar</hi> was of
<hi>Daniel; Keepe thy Rewards to thy selfe, and giue thy Giftes to
another.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. That thy <hi>Gifts</hi> obserue the true latitude of Deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
which endeuours to extend it selfe to the glory of
God, the good of thy Brother, and the saluation of thy
owne Soule. And to all these three, may these three
<hi>Gifts</hi> of the <hi>Wise-men</hi> be preferred. The <hi>Incense</hi> of Prayer,
respects God: the <hi>Gold</hi> of Charitie respects our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour:
and the <hi>Myrrhe</hi> of Mortification respects our
selues.</p>
                     <p>3. That you offer not onely one, but all these. It hath
been question'd, Whether these <hi>Magi</hi> did offer <hi>Singuli
singula,</hi> or <hi>singuli tria:</hi> But the consent of Diuines is, that
they gaue euery one all, <hi>Semel et fimul.</hi> Thy Oblation
will not be welcome, if any one of the three be missing;
<hi>Giue</hi> then all.</p>
                     <p>Some will giue <hi>Myrrhe,</hi> but not <hi>Frankincense:</hi> Some
will giue <hi>Frankincense,</hi> but not <hi>Myrrhe:</hi> and some will
giue <hi>Myrrhe</hi> and <hi>Frankincense,</hi> but not <hi>Gold.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. Some will giue <hi>Myrrhe,</hi> a strict Morall life, not
culpable of any grosse eruption, or scandalous impiety:
but not <hi>Frankincense.</hi> Their <hi>Prayers</hi> are thinne sowne;
therefore their Graces cannot come vp thicke. Perhaps
they feele no want; and then you know, <hi>Rarae fumant
faliorbus Arae:</hi> In their thought, they doe not stand in
any great need of God: when theydoe, they will offer
him some <hi>Incense.</hi> These liue a morally honest life, but
are scant of religious <hi>Prayers:</hi> and so may be said to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<hi>Myrrhe</hi> without <hi>Frankincense.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. Some will giue <hi>Frankincense: Pray</hi> frequently,
perhaps tediously; but they will giue no <hi>Myrrhe,</hi> not
mortifie or restraine their Concupiscence. The <hi>Phars<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
had many Prayers; but neuer the fewer sinnes. These
mocke God, when they so often begge of him, that his
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:524:55"/>
                        <hi>Will</hi> may be done, when they neuer subdue their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to it. There are too many such among vs, that will
often ioyne with the Church in common Deuotions,
who yet ioyne with the world in common vices. These
make great smoakes of <hi>Frankincense,</hi> but let not fall one
droppe of <hi>Myrrhe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. Some will giue both <hi>Myrrhe</hi> and <hi>Frankincense,</hi> but
by no meanes their <hi>Gold.</hi> I will giue (sayth the World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling)
a Sober life; there's my <hi>Myrrhe:</hi> I will say my
Prayers, there's my <hi>Frankincense:</hi> but doe you thinke
I will part with my <hi>Gold?</hi> This same <hi>Gold</hi> lyes closer in
mens Hearts, then it doth in their Purses: You may as
well wring <hi>Hercules</hi> Clubbe out of his Fist, as a Penny
from their heapes, to charitable vses.</p>
                     <p>You haue read (2. Sam. 24. 24.) how <hi>Areunah, like a
King, gaue to the King Oxen for Sacrifice, and the Instruments
for Fuell:</hi> But <hi>Dauid</hi> answered, <hi>Shall I offer burnt Offerings
vnto the Lord my God, of that which doth cost mee nothing?</hi>
These men will giue God Oblations, and enough; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided
they cost them nothing. The Vsurer must saue
his <hi>Gold</hi> for his idolatrous Eye, the Drunkard for his
Host, the Lustfull for his Whore, the Proude for his
Backe, the Epicure for his Belly: Can you hope they
will part from their <hi>Gold?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <q>Aurum omnes, pulsaiam pietate, colunt,</q>

They write of the Toad, that shee eates of nothing but
the Earth; and thereof no more, then shee can hold in

Generations.</p>
                     <p>How this Sicknesse grouels a man! how it stoupes
him into Earth, into Hell! This Disease lyes in mens
Bones. I haue read of a Beggar, that passed by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of Rich men, and earnestly besought their Almes,
complayning that hee had a secret Disease lying in his
Bones, that hee could not earne his lyuing: They in
charity gaue him somewat, and let him goe. One a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the rest following him, would needes know of
him, what that secret Disease should be, seeing that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
hee seemed to ayle nothing. Quoth the Beggar,
you cannot see it, for it lyes in my Bones; and some call
it Idlenesse. You see many a Rich man, whose cuppe
of Wealth runnes ouer: you wonder to see him so mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable,
both to himselfe and others. Why, there is a
Disease that lyes in his Bones; that keepes him from
working the workes of Charitie, from relieuing his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed
Brethren: you may call it <hi>Couetousnesse.</hi> They
will part with any thing, so they may keepe their <hi>Gold.</hi>
But we must giue our <hi>Gold</hi> too, with the rest: If wee of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer

sense, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 2.) is growne
at once deformed and suttle.
And, as it is commonly seene,
that mishapen trunckes are
houses of the sharpest wittes:
as it was said of the Emperour
<hi>Galba, Ingenium Galbae male
habitat;</hi> because he had an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
witte, with an vncomely body: nature recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
her defection one way, with perfection another
way. So the world is become ill-fauoured, and shrewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated;
as politike in braine, as it is stigmatike in limbs.
<hi>Honestie,</hi> though it be elder then fraud, yet hath lost the
priuiledge in mens estimation: It may keepe the priori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:524:59"/>
the superioritie is gone; and it must be faine <hi>to serue
the yonger.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Plaine-dealing</hi> was held a good cittisen, a good towns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:
but Double-dealing, since hee came blustring in,
hath thrust him <hi>sedibus, aedibus;</hi> out of house and home;
out of repute among men, out of succour of friends;
out of Commons, and almost out of Canons; out of
his house in the Towne, and seate in the Church.</p>
                  <p>I will therefore call backe antiquitie, and present to
your eyes the puritie of the Primitiue times. For I may
say with <hi>Tertullian; Perfectiora prima:</hi> the neerer the
spring-head, the purer streames. Men, <hi>quo minus ab or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu
aberant,</hi> might more perfectly discerne, and more
constantly follow the truth. <hi>Iacob</hi> is our exemplar, and
patterne of <hi>Plaine-dealing.</hi> He was a plaine man, dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in tents.</p>
                  <div type="part">

<hi>Esau</hi> abuseth it, <hi>Gen. 27. 36. Is he not rightly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Iacob? for he hath supplanted me these two times. Hee
tooke away my Birth-right, and behold, now hee hath taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way

For his Life, he was a <hi>Plaine-dealing</hi> man; simple,
and without fraud. Though some autithetically op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it to <hi>Esau's</hi> roughnesse. That <hi>Esau was an hairy man,</hi>
but <hi>Iacob</hi> was <hi>Plaine</hi> &amp; smooth; without any semblance
to his brothers ruggednesse. We deny not, that <hi>Iacob</hi>
was so: that exposition is true, but not enough. It falls
short of that praise, which Gods spirit heere meanes
him. <hi>He was a Plaine man;</hi> without craft or subtiltie.</p>
                     <p>For his delight and profession, <hi>Hee dwelt in tents.</hi>
Which though the Hebrewes expound of frequenting
the tents of <hi>Sem</hi> and <hi>Heber</hi> for knowledge; is indeed
onely a description of such as liue in the fields, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
themselues about cattell: and this wee frequently
finde to be <hi>Iacobs</hi> desire and practise. The good Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs
were <hi>plaine men:</hi> plaine in their clothes; no seas
crossed for strange stuffes and fashions: plaine in their
houses, which were meere <hi>Tents;</hi> not gorgeous parlors
without hospitalitie: <hi>plaine</hi> in their dyet, as <hi>Iacob</hi> heere,
that fed on <hi>Lentil</hi>-pottage.</p>

<hi>Plaine-dealing:</hi> it is primarily necessary to prooue him
clearely so. Otherwise the Originall beeing faultie,

buyes that which hee could not winne: and by an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
art redeemes the losses of nature. But this action
smells of cunning, and seemes to marre the credite of
his <hi>Plaine-dealing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. <hi>Iacob</hi> is accused for cruell and vncharitable dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
with his brother. <hi>Esau</hi> comes hungry from the
field, he is ready to die for want of sustenance; he sees
his brother (in no such exigent) with food in his hand;
he breakes forth into an earnest complaint, intreating
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:524:62"/>
his commiseration: now, shall a brother deny reliefe to
his brother being ready to die, except vpon such intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
conditions? Sure it could be no lesse then a hard
measure, to take such aduantage of a brothers necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
But it is answered, that there could not be any such
necessity of <hi>Esaus</hi> coueting <hi>Iacobs</hi> pottage; for there
was (if not lentile pottage) store of as good meate in
the house; able to haue giuen satisfaction to his hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and ready enough at his request, being the elder
sonne. It was not then distressed needinesse, but insa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate
greedinesse, that wrought <hi>Esaus</hi> lust to <hi>Iacobs</hi> pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.
And it is not vnfit, that the luxurious appetite
should pay for his follie.</p>
                     <p>2. But <hi>Iacob</hi> cannot be excused of couetousnesse;
that would set no lower a price on his pottage, then the
Birthright. Which comprehended many priuiledges;
prioritie, gouernement of the brethren, a double por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the rest, the Priesthood and right to sacrifice,
and (what yet further commended it) a type and figure
of euerlasting life. And will <hi>Iacob</hi> require such a Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
including all these priuiledges for a messe of pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage?
what tyrant could set such an Impost on a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandise!
what citizen such a price on his engrossed
commodities? Heere was an exaction beyond the tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Tiberius:</hi> an extortion more extreame then an
Vsurers. We answere, Not as the Hebrewes conceit,
that <hi>Iacob</hi> afterwards gaue a greater summe, and payd
this but as an earnest: the Scripture neyther expressing
directly, nor inferring by consequence any such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
But we say, that <hi>Iacob,</hi> by the instruction of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
knew that the Birthright did iustly belong to him,
by the preordination of God: therefore now wisely ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
this opportunity to r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> couer that to himselfe, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
his brother was but an vsurper: For though <hi>Esau</hi>
could pleade the right of Nature, <hi>Iacob</hi> could the right
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:524:62"/>
of grace; and hee knew this would at last preuaile. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
yet must this particular fact of <hi>Iacob</hi> be drawne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a generall imitation. His warrant was a diuine reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation;
the silence whereof in these dayes sends vs for
direction to the written Truth,<note place="margin">Esay 8. 20</note> 
                        <hi>To the Lawe, to the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie:</hi>
let this resolue and instruct thee.</p>
                     <p>3. But this Birthright was a holy thing, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Apostle</hi> calles him a <hi>Profane person</hi> for selling it:<note place="margin">Hebr. 12. 16</note>
Now there is no profanenesse in selling a thing not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred.
But if sanctified things cannot bee solde without
sinne, can they be bought without sinne? Did not <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>
offend as much in the one, as <hi>Esau</hi> in the other? It
is well answered, that <hi>Iacob intelligi potest suam redemisse
vexationem:</hi> he did but buy his owne vexation. He buies
not simply a thing, wherunto he had no right; but only
taketh this occasion to recouer his owne: whereof the
appointment of God had made him a possible, yea cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely
future proprietary. It was neuer held Simonie,
for a spirituall man to buy his owne peace. Many things
are detained from the cleargie vniustly, which Gods
law hath made sacred and theirs: they may therefore
without touch of Simoniacall dealing, redeeme their
owne quietnesse, and purchase a peaceable possession.
I say not, that any man may buy a spirituall endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
before hee hath it; but when he hath it in right,
he may purchase his owne peaceful and quiet enioying
it. All that can be said, is this: <hi>Esau</hi> preferred his belly
before his Birthright: <hi>Iacob</hi> his Birthright before his
belly. The one solde spirituall things for temporall,
the other with temporall things bought spirituall.</p>
                     <p>And who will not part with transient benefites for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
blessings? If eyther by suite, or strife, or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
we can attaine Heauen, wee are happy. For suite,
there is no houre vnseasonable, no prayer vnwelcome,
no importunitie troublesome. The vniust Iudge could
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:524:63"/>
giue reliefe to the importunate widow:<note place="margin">Luke 18. 5.</note> and shal not our
iust God giue eare and ease to our incessant plaints?
Spare to speake, and spare to speed: the timorous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quester
teacheth the inuocated a deniall. For strife; we
know who taught vs, that <hi>the Kingdome of Heauen suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
violence,</hi> and must bee attained by a holy kinde of
force. <hi>Iacob</hi> must wrastle for the Blessing before hee
hath it: and so wrastling hee shall haue it, though he
bee sent halting to his graue. The Lord knowes our
strength, yet hee loues our violence and importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:
and therefore hath so conditioned the gate of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
that without our <hi>Striuing,</hi> we must not looke to
enter it. For purchase, had a farre higher rate beene
set on the Birthright, <hi>Iacob</hi> would not haue grudged to
giue it. He hath too much of the blood of <hi>Esau</hi> in him,
that will not forgoe all the world, rather then the Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right.
The wise Merchant, when hee knew the field
wherein lay that hidden treasure, solde all hee had to

it in his owne expresse words. <hi>Rebecca</hi> presuming
vpon the Oracle of God, and her husbands simplicity,
dares be <hi>Iacobs</hi> suretie for the danger, his counseller for
the carriage of the businesse, his cooke for the dyet;
yea dresses both the meate and the man. And now puts
dishes into his hand, words into his mouth, the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
on his backe, the goates haire vppon the open
parts of his body, and sends him in thus furnished for
the blessing. Standing no doubt at the doore, to see
how well her lesson was learned, how well her deuice
succeeded. And if olde <hi>Isaac</hi> should by any of his sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
haue discerned the guile, shee had soone stept in,
and vndertaken the blame, and vrged him with that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:524:64"/>

<hi>Esaus</hi> seruitude; which either age or affection had made

<hi>Esaus</hi> tongue as well as his garments, that she might
securely deceiue all the senses of him, which had suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

But this is past her remedy: her son must name

                     </p>
                     <p>We see the proceeding: it is now examinable, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this doth not somewhat impeach the credite of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs
Plaine-Dealing.</hi> There haue beene vndertakers of
<hi>Iacobs</hi> iustification, or at least excusation in this fact.
Let vs heare what they say.<note place="margin">Hom. 6. in Ezek.</note> 1. <hi>Gregorie</hi> thus excuseth
it: that <hi>Iahob</hi> did not steale the Blessing by fraud, but <hi>si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi
debitam, accepit,</hi> tooke it as a due to himselfe, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
that the primogeniture was formerly deuolued to
him. The truth is, he that ought the <hi>Birthright,</hi> might
iustly chalenge the <hi>Blessing:</hi> but this doth not wholly
excuse the fact.<note place="margin">Hom. 53. in Genes.</note> 2. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> thus mitigates it; that
<hi>non studio nocendi contexit fraudem,</hi> hee did not deceiue,
with a minde to hurt; but onely in respect of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of God. But this is not sufficient; for there was
an intention of hurt, both to <hi>Isaac</hi> in deceiuing him,
and to <hi>Esau,</hi> in depriuing him of the Blessing. But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
may bee pleaded for the defence of <hi>Iacobs</hi> dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation
in outward gesture, there is no apologie for
the words of his tongue. The meaning of the speach
is in the speaker; therefore his tongue cannot be guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
when it goes against his conscious heart: but
the meaning of the gesture, is in the interpreter, who
giues it a voluntary construction. Gesture is more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
ruled then speach: and it is hard, if the tongue will
not blabbe what a man is, in spite of his habite. <hi>Isaacs</hi>
eyes might be deceiued, they were dimme: his hands,
by the roughnesse of the garments: his nosthrills by
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:524:65"/>
the smell of them: his palate, by the sauour of the meat.
All these senses yeeld affiance, what then shall driue <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saac</hi>
to a suspition or incredulitie? None but this, the
eare stickes at the iudgement; that sayes, <hi>the voyce is the
voyce of Iacob.</hi> To helpe forward this deceit, three lies
are tumbled out, one in the necke of another. 1. <hi>I am
Esau thy first borne. 2. I haue done as thou badst me. 3. eate
of my venison.</hi> To cleare him of this sinne of lying, hath
beene more peremptorily vndertaken, then soundly
performed.</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>Chrysostome,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Hom. 5. in Genes.</note> with diuers others, thinke that thogh
he did lie, hee did not sinne; because hee did it by the
reuelation and counsell of God. So that God willing
to haue the prediction fulfilled, dispensing and dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
all things, is brought in as the preordainer of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs</hi>
lie, that I say not the Patron. But not without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation
to his diuine Iustice. For first, it appeares not
that this was the counsell of God, but onely <hi>Rebeccaes</hi>
deuice, verse 8. <hi>Heare my voice my sonne, in that which I
commaund thee.</hi> My voice, not Gods; what I command,
not what GOD approoues. 2. If <hi>Iacob</hi> had receiued
any oraculous warrant for this proiect, hee would not
haue had so doubtfull an opinion of the successe.
The matter was forseene of God; not allowed: for
God neuer inspireth lies. Gods wise disposition of this
meanes, affords no warrant of his approbation. He or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth
many things, which hee ordayned not. The
means were so vnlawfull, that <hi>Iacob</hi> himselfe doth more
distrust their successe, then hope for their blessing. He
knew that good <hi>Isaac</hi> beeing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â¢</desc>
                        </gap>o <hi>plaine</hi>-hearted himselfe,
would seuerely punish deceit in his sonne. Men in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
truely honest, are the sorest enemies to fraudulent
courses in others. Hee therefore carries his meate in
trembling hands; and scarce dares hope, that God will
blesse such a subtletie with good euent. Yet he did; but
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:524:65"/>
how! Heere was prodigall dissembling: a dissembled
person, a dissembled name, dissembled venison, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling
answere; yet beholde a true blessing; to the
man, not to the meanes. Thus God may worke his
owne will out of our infirmities; yet without approuall
of our weakenesse, or wronging the integritie of his
owne goodnes.</p>
                     <p>2. Some haue confessed it a lie, but a guiltlesse he;
by reason of a necessitie imagined in this exigent; as if
GOD could not haue wrought <hi>Isaacs</hi> heart to blesse
<hi>Iacob</hi> in this short <hi>interim,</hi> whiles <hi>Esau</hi> was gone a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
for venison. <hi>Origen</hi> sayes, that <hi>Necessitie may vrge a
man to vse a lie, as sawce to his meate:</hi> Another; as Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
vse <hi>Hellebora.</hi> But that which is simply euill, can
by no apologie be made good. <hi>Causa patrocinio non bona,
peicr erit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. Some take from it all imputation of alie, and
directly iustifie it. <hi>Augustine</hi> thinkes <hi>Iacob</hi> spoke my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stically,
and that it is to bee referred to <hi>Iacobs</hi> bodie,
not to <hi>Iacobs</hi> person; to the Christian Church that
should take away the Birthright from the elder. But
wee may better receiue, that <hi>Iacob</hi> fell into an infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
then the colour of an allegorie. Neyther doth
the successe iustifie the meanes. As some Philosophers
haue deliuered, that <hi>Prosperum, scelus vocatur virtus;</hi>
luckie wickednesse merites the name of goodnesse. But
<hi>Iacobs</hi> one act of falshoode, shall not disparage wholly
that simplicitie the Scripture giues him; <hi>Hee was a
plaine man.</hi> To bee vniust condemnes a man, not the
dooing of one singular act vniustly: therefore God
casts not off <hi>Iacob</hi> for this one infirmitie: but makes vse
of this infirmity to serue his owne purpose. If <hi>Esaus</hi>
and <hi>Iacobs</hi> workes bee weighed together in a ballance;
one would thinke the more solide vertue to bee in
<hi>Esau's.</hi>

the <hi>Blessing</hi> where hee did; and that it was due to him,

that hee had performed vnwilling iustice; and executed

                     </p>
                     <p>2. <hi>Iacob</hi> apprehends this meanes to recouer his
owne; due vnto him by a double right: first, as the
wages of twenty yeares seruice, <hi>Genesis</hi> 31. 7. yet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payd.
Secondly,<note place="margin">Gen. 31. 15</note> as the dowry for his wiues; whom mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
<hi>Laban</hi> had thrust vppon him without any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
portion. Thirdly, especially Gods warrant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring;
it was lawfull for him to recouer that by poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
which was detained from him by iniury. So did the
<hi>Israelites</hi> borrow of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> their best goods, ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wells,
and ornaments; and bore them away as a iust re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
of their long seruice.</p>
                     <p>3. Lastly, hee is quitted by that saying, <hi>Volenti non
fit iniuria. Laban</hi> sees that hee was well blessed by <hi>Iacobs</hi>
seruice: the encreasing his flockes makes him loath to
part. But <hi>Iacob</hi> hath serued long enough for a dead
pay; somewhat hee must haue, or be gone. His hard
vnckle biddes him aske a hire: you know <hi>Iacobs</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund:
<hi>Laban</hi> readily promoues this bargaine; which
at last made his sonne in law rich, and himselfe enuious.
So sayth <hi>Caluine, Tractatus est prosuo ingenio; Laban</hi> is
handled in his kinde. Hee thought by this meanes, to
haue multiplyed his owne flockes: but those few spot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
sheepe and goates, vpon this couenant, as if they
had beene weary of their olde owner, alter their fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and runne their best yoong into party-colours;
changing at once their colour, and their maister. So
that this meanes, which <hi>Iacob</hi> vsed, was not fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
or artificiall, but naturall; not depending vpon
mans witte, but Gods blessing: who considering his
tedious and painfull seruice, payes him good wages out
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:524:67"/>
of his vnckles foldes. For foureteene yeares the Lord
hath for <hi>Iacob</hi> enriched <hi>Laban:</hi> therefore for these last
six he will out of <hi>Laban</hi> enrich <hi>Iacob.</hi> And if the vnckles
flocke be the greater, the nephews shall be the better.
Most iustly then is <hi>Iacob</hi> cleared from iniustice; and no
aspersion of fraud with <hi>Laban</hi> can be cast to discredite
his <hi>Plaine-Dealing.</hi>

excels in beauty. Wee may say of this Sister, as
it was sayd of the good Woman,<note place="margin">Pro. 31. 29.</note> 
                     <hi>Prou. 31. Many
daughters haue done vertuously, but thou surpassest them all.
Paul</hi> doth not disparage any, when he sayth, <hi>Charity is
the greatest.</hi> All starres are bright, though <hi>one starre</hi> may
<hi>differ from another in glory.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.</note> Wee may say of graces, as
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:524:73"/>
of the Captaines of the sonnes of <hi>Gad; the least can
resist a hundred, the greatest a thousand.</hi> Or as the song
was of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Dauid. Saul hath slaine his thousand, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid
his ten thousand. Faith</hi> is excellent, so is <hi>Hope;</hi> but
<hi>the greatest of these, is Charitie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mee thinkes these three Theologall Vertues may
not vnfitly bee compared to three great Feastes, which
wee celebrate in the yeare; Easter, Whitsuntide, and
Christmas. <hi>Faith,</hi> like Easter, beleeues <hi>Christ dead for
our sinnes, and risen againe for our Iustification. Hope,</hi> like
Pentecost, waites for the comming of the holy Ghost,
Gods free Spirit of grace to come into vs, and to bring
vs to Heauen. And <hi>Charitie</hi> lookes like Christmas,
full of loue to our neighbours, full of hospitality, and
mercy to the poore.</p>
                  <p>These are three strings often touched; <hi>Faith,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
wee beleeue all Gods promises to bee true, and
ours: <hi>Hope,</hi> whereby we waite for them with patience:
<hi>Charitie,</hi> whereby vee testifie, what wee beleeue and
hope. Hee that hath <hi>faith</hi> cannot distrust: hee that
hath <hi>hope,</hi> cannot bee put from anchor: he that hath
<hi>charity,</hi> will not lead a licentious life; for, <hi>Loue keepes
the commandements.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For Methods sake, wee might first conferre them
all, then preferre one. But I will speake of them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the three degrees of comparison. 1. Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely.
2. Comparatiuely. 3. Superlatiuely. <hi>The
greatest of these is Charitie.</hi>

broken out into blaines and biles, argues a corrupted
liuer or stomacke within: so the spottes and vlcers of
thy life demonstrate a putrified heart. Loe now thy wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses.
Thou art gone at the common Law of Iustice:
It is onely the Chancerie of mercy that must cleare
thee. What wilt thou now doe? What, but humble
thy selfe in repentance for thy false faith; take prayer
in thy company, for pardon of former errors; goe by
the word preached; for the Minister is, as it were, the
Register, to ingrosse the deed; and desire God on the
humbled knees of thy soule, to giue thee a new and a
true <hi>Euidence.</hi> Let this instruct vs to some vses.</p>
                     <p>1. Be sure that thy <hi>Euidence</hi> is good. <hi>Satan</hi> is a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till

his Vineyard, pruneth it, watereth it, is prouident
ouer it: What's this to thee, that art a thorne, and

                     <p>The distinction betweene <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Hope,</hi> is nice,

into three respects, of <hi>Order, Office,</hi> and

                     </p>
                     <p>For <hi>Order, Paul</hi> giues <hi>Faith</hi> the precedencie.
<hi>Hebr. 11. Faith is the ground of things hoped for. Faith</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
goes before, <hi>Hope</hi> followes after; and may in
some sort bee sayde to bee the daughter of <hi>Faith.</hi>
For, it is as impossible for a man to <hi>Hope</hi> for that
which hee beleeues not, as for a Painter to drawe a
picture in the ayre. Indeed, more is beleeued then is
hoped for; but nothing is hoped for, which is not
beleeued. So that on necessity, in respect of order,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:524:78"/>
                        <hi>Faith</hi> must precede <hi>Hope.</hi>

                     <p>For <hi>Office; Faith</hi> is the Christians Logicke, <hi>Hope</hi>
his Rhetorike. <hi>Faith</hi> perceiues what is to bee done,
<hi>Hope</hi> giues alacritie to the doing it. <hi>Faith</hi> guides, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viseth,
rectifieth; <hi>Hope</hi> couragiously encounters with
all adversaries. Therefore <hi>Faith</hi> is compared to a
Doctor in the Schooles, <hi>Hope</hi> to a Captaine in the
warres. <hi>Faith</hi> discernes the truth, <hi>Hope</hi> fights against
impatience, heauinesse of Spirit, infirmitie, deiected<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
desperation. Divines haue alluded the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betweene <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi> in Divinity, to that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
wisedome and valour in Philosophie. Valour

is of things both good and bad, <hi>Hope</hi> of good things
onely. A man beleeues there is a hell, as truely as he
beleeues there is a heaven; but he feares the one, and
<hi>hopes</hi> onely for the other. <hi>Faith</hi> hath obiected to it
things past, present, future. Past, it beleeues Christ
dead for our sinnes, and risen againe for our Iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Present, that hee now sits at the right hand of
his Father in heauen. Future, that hee shall come to
iudge quicke and dead. <hi>Hope,</hi> onely respects and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects
things to come. For a man cannot <hi>hope</hi> for
that which hee hath. You see how in some sense, <hi>Hope</hi>
excels <hi>Faith.</hi> For, there is a faith in the Deuils; they
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:524:78"/>
beleeue the truth of God, the certainety of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
they acknowledge Christ the Iudge of quicke
and dead, therefore cry, <hi>Why tormentest thou vs before

good worke, <hi>Feare;</hi> the Deuils <hi>beleeue and
tremble:</hi> yea, they pray: they beseech Christ not to
send them into the deepes; what then want they? <hi>Hope,</hi>
a confident expectation of the mercy of God: this
they can neuer haue. They beleeue, they cannot hope.
This is the life of Christians, and the want makes De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils.

glimmering resemblance of the Trinity vncreate. For,
as there, the Sonne is begotten of the Father, and the

<hi>Charity.</hi> Thus is Gods Temple built in our

                     <p>In the godly all these three are vnited together, &amp;
cannot bee sundred. Wee <hi>beleeue</hi> in Gods mercy, wee
<hi>hope</hi> for his mercy, and we <hi>loue</hi> him for his mercy. <hi>Faith</hi>
sayes, there are good things prepared: <hi>Hope</hi> sayes, they
are prepared for me: <hi>Charity</hi> sayes, I endevour to walke
worthy of them. So that, what good <hi>Faith</hi> beleeues,
shall bee, <hi>Hope</hi> expects for her selfe, and <hi>Charity</hi> aymes
at the way to get it, by <hi>keeping the commandements. Faith</hi>
apprehends both reward and punishment: <hi>Hope</hi> onely

<hi>Paul</hi> commends not <hi>loue</hi> for the vertue of Iustificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
it may fayle in that particular action, yet receiue

A Prince doth excell a peasant: shall any man
therefore inferre, that hee can plow better, or haue
more skill in tillage. A Philosopher doth excell a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanicke;
though he cannot grinde so well as a Miller,
or lim so cunningly as a Painter. A man is better then
a beast: who but a mad-man will therefore conclude,
that hee can runne faster then a horse, draw more then
an oxe, or carry a greater burden then an Elephant.
Though he fayle in these particular arts, yet none will
deny, but hee is better then a beast.</p>
                     <p>The truth is, that in <hi>FÃ ith</hi> stands originally our fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:524:79"/>
with God. Into that hand he powreth the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of his mercy for salvation: and were the actions
of <hi>Charity</hi> neuer so great, and (foolishly thought) meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious;
yet, if not the effects of a true sauing <hi>Faith,</hi>
they are lost, and a man may for his <hi>Charitie</hi> goe to the
Deuill. And though they would plead from the forme
of the last iudgement, <hi>Math.</hi> 25. that God accepts men
to life for their deeds of <hi>Charitie:</hi> feeding, clothing, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing.
Yet the Scripture fully testifies, that God nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
accepts these, nor our selues for these, further then
they are the effects of a true <hi>faith.</hi> Our persons being
first iustified by faith in Christ, then God will crowne
our works. Yet a Christian must worke: for no nudifidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
so well as no nullifidian, shall be admitted into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.
Therefore sayth the <hi>Apostle,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>Faith worketh by loue.</hi>

selfe. The hand alone can receiue an Almes: but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
cut a peece of wood without an axe or some instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<hi>Faith</hi> is the Christians hand, and can without
helpe receyue Gods giuen grace into the heart: but to
produce the fruits of obedience, and to vorke the actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
duties required, it must haue an inst<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Loue</hi> to it, and it <hi>worketh</hi> by <hi>loue.</hi> So that the one is our
Iustification before God, and the other our Testifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
before men. Wherein then consists this high tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendency
of <hi>Charity?</hi> In two priviledges, incommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
to <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Hope; Latitude</hi> and <hi>Perpetuity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. For Latitude, <hi>Loue</hi> is the <hi>greatest. Faith</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi>
are restrayned within the limits of our particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
<hi>The iust man liues by his owne faith:</hi> and hopes good
to himselfe; but <hi>Loue</hi> is like the <hi>Vine,</hi> which <hi>God brought
out of Egypt,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 80. 8.</note> 
                        <hi>and cast out the heathen to plant it, which coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
the mountaines with the shadow of the boughes, &amp; spreads
the branches vnto the sea and the riuers:</hi> It is like
the Sunne in the skie, that throwes his comfortable
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:524:80"/>
beames vpon all; and forbeares not to warme euen
that earth that beareth weeds. <hi>Loue</hi> extends to earth &amp;
heauen. In heauen it affecteth God the Maker and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver:
the Angels, as our Guardians; the triumphant
Saints, for their pious sanctitie. On earth, it imbraceth
those that feare the Lord especially: it wisheth conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to those that do not: it counsels the rich: it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
the poore: it reverenceth superiors, respecteth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriors:
doth good to friends, no evill to foes: wisheth
well to all. This is the latitude of <hi>Charity.</hi> The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
of <hi>faith,</hi> is to receyue into it selfe: the property of
<hi>loue,</hi> to lay out it selfe to others. So that <hi>faith</hi> hath but
narrow limits, but the extent of <hi>Loue</hi> is vniversall, not
bounded with the world. <hi>Faith</hi> beleeues for thy selfe,
but <hi>Charity</hi> deriues, &amp; driues the effects of <hi>thy faith</hi> to
others. <hi>Thy faith</hi> relieues thy self, thy <hi>charity</hi> thy brother.</p>
                     <p>2. For perpetvity and continuance. <hi>Faith</hi> laies hold
on Gods gracious promise for everlasting salvation:
<hi>Hope</hi> expects this with patience: but when God shal ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil
his word, &amp; vs with ioy, then <hi>Faith</hi> shall be at an end:
<hi>hope</hi> at an end: but <hi>Loue</hi> shal remain between God &amp; vs,
an everlasting bond. Therefore sayth the Apostle,
<hi>Now abideth faith, &amp;c. Now.</hi> Now three, then one: and
that is <hi>Charity.</hi> When wee haue possession of those
pleasures, which we hoped and beleeued, what longer
vse is there of <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Hope?</hi> But our loues shall not
end with our liues. Wee shall euerlastingly <hi>loue</hi> our
our Maker, Saviour, Sanctifier, Angels, &amp; Saints; where
no discontent shall breed any iarre in our <hi>Halleluiahs.</hi> If
the vse of loue bee so comfortable on earth, what may
wee thinke it will be in heaven!</p>
                     <p>Thus sayth <hi>Chrysost: Onely loue is eternall.</hi> Now
<hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi> hold vp the hands of <hi>Charity,</hi> as <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi>
and <hi>Hur</hi> helde vp the hands of <hi>Moses:</hi> but then
their vse and office shall cease. <hi>Tunc non erit spes, quando
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:524:80"/>
erit spes. Hope</hi> shall not bee, when the thing <hi>hoped</hi> is.
<hi>Hope</hi> shall bring in possession, possession shall thrust
out <hi>Hope.</hi> Therefore sayth <hi>Augustine,</hi> is <hi>Charity grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
Et si non propter eminentiam, tamen propter permanenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am;</hi>
If not for the excellency, yet for the perpetuity.</p>
                     <p>Thus to iustifie a man, <hi>Faith</hi> is greater, but in a man
iustified, <hi>Charity</hi> is greater. Let <hi>Faith</hi> alone with the
great worke of our salvation: but that finished, it shall
end, &amp; so yeeld superiority to <hi>Loue,</hi> which shall endure
for euer.</p>

double reason. The Position is, <hi>No
man can tame the Tongue.</hi> The Reasons,
1. <hi>It is vnruly. 2. Full of deadly poyson.</hi>
Heere is busie dealing with a wilde
member: a more difficult action, and
intractable nature could not haue met. <hi>Tongue</hi> is the
Subiect (I meane in the discourse;) and can you euer
thinke of subiecting it naturally to reason, or taming
it to Religion? Goe leade a Lyon in a single haire, send
vp an Eagle to the skie to pecke out a starre, cope vp
the thunder, and quench a flaming City with one wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes

Proposition is backed with two reasons; so each rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;

so each reason hath a terrible second, The <hi>Euill</hi>

It is <hi>evil,</hi> yea <hi>vnruly euill:</hi> it is <hi>poyson,</hi> yea, <hi>deadly poyson.</hi>
The Fort is so barricadoed, that it is hard scaling it: the

warded with <hi>vnruly</hi> and <hi>deadly;</hi> as if it were with Gyants

                     <p>Hee that made all, made the <hi>Tongue:</hi> he that craues
all, must haue the <hi>Tongue. Quicreavit necessariam, postu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat
creatam.</hi> It is an instrument, let it giue Musicke to
him that made it. All creatures in their kind blesse
God. <hi>Psal.</hi> 148. They that wanttongues, as the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens,
Sunne, Starres, Meteors, Orbes, Elements;
prayse him with such obedient Testimonies, as their
insensible natures can afford. They that haue tongues,
though they want reason, prayse him with those natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Organs. The birds of the ayre sing, the beasts of
the earth make a noyse; not so much as the hissing
Serpents, the very <hi>Dragons in the deepe,</hi> but sound out
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:524:83"/>
his praise. Man then, that hath a tongue, and a reason
to guide it, (and if more, a religion to direct his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son)
should much, much more blesse him. Therefore
sayes the <hi>Psalmographer,</hi> that for the well tuning of his
<hi>Tongue,</hi> is called the <hi>sweete Singer of Israel, I will praise
the Lord with the best Instrument I haue;</hi> which was his
<hi>Tongue.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Not that praises can adde to Gods glory, nor blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies
detract from it. The blessing <hi>Tongue</hi> cannot
make him better,<note place="margin">Aug. in Psal. 134</note> nor the cursing, worse. <hi>Nec melior si
laudaueris, nec deterior si vituperaueris.</hi> As the Sunne is
neither betterd by birds singing, nor battered by dogs
barking. He is so infinitely great, and constantly good,
that his glory admittes neyther addition, nor diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>Yet we that cannot make his name greater, can make
it seeme greater: and though wee can not enlarge his
glory, we may enlarge the manifestation of his glory.
This both in words praysing, and in workes practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.
We know it is impossible to make a new <hi>Christ,</hi>
as the Papists boast the almightinesse of their Priests:
yet our holy liues, and happy lippes (if I may so speak)
may make a little <hi>Christ,</hi> a great <hi>Christ.</hi> They that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
little regarded him, may thus be brought to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme
him greatly: giuing him the honour due to his
name, and glorifying him, after our example.</p>
                     <p>This is the <hi>Tongues</hi> office. One member, without
arrogating any merite, or boasting the beholdingnesse
of the rest vnto it, is to doe that duetie which is assig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
it. The eye is to see for all, the eare to heare for all,
the hand to worke for all, the feete to walke for all, the
knees to bow for all, the <hi>Tongue</hi> to praise GOD for
all. This is the <hi>Tongues</hi> office, not vnlike the Towne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarkes,
which if it performe not well, the Corporation
is better without it. The <hi>Tongue</hi> is mans clapper, and is

What it hath lost in the thickenesse, it hath got
in the quickenesse: and the defect of magnitude is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced
in the fortitude: an arme may bee longer,
but the <hi>Tongue</hi> is stronger; and a legge hath more flesh

                     <p>If it be a talking tongue, it is <hi>mundus garrulitatis,</hi> a
world of prating. If it be a wrangling tongue, it is <hi>mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus
litigationis,</hi> a world of brabbling. If it be a learned
tongue, it is as <hi>Erasmus</hi> sayd of Bishop <hi>Tonstall, mundus

it is <hi>mundus scurrilitatis,</hi> a world of wantonnesse. If it be

                     <p>1. To create so little a peece of flesh, and to put such
vigour into it: to giue it neyther bones nor nerues, yet
to make it stronger then armes and legges, and those
most able and seruiceable parts of the body.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 23</note> So that as
<hi>Paul</hi> sayth, 1. <hi>Cor. 12. On those members of the body, which
we thinke lesse honourable, we bestow more abundant honour:
and our vncomely parts haue more abundant comelinesse.</hi> So
on this little weake member hath the Lord conferred
the greatest strength; and as feeble as it is, wee finde it
both more necessary, and more honourable.</p>
                     <p>2 Because it is so forcible, therefore hath the most
wise God ordayned, that it shall be but little, that it shall
be but one. That so the parvity and singularity may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
the vigour, the rigour of it. If it were paired, as
the armes, legges, hands, feete, it would be much more

                     <p>3. Because it is so <hi>Vnruly,</hi> the Lord hath hedged it in,
as a man will not trust a wilde horse in an open pasture,

God hath made vs men, we make our selues mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.
He hath giuen vs two eyes, two eares, two hands,

one. We haue one eye to pry into others faults, not an
other to see our owne. Wee haue one eare to heare the
Plaintife, not the other for the Defendant. We haue
a foote swift to enter forbidden paths, not another to
leade vs to Gods holy place. We haue one hand to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort,
and scrape, and wound, and not another to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue,
giue almes, heale the wounded. But now where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
God hath giuen vs, but one <hi>tongue,</hi> and one heart,
and bidden vs be content with their singularity; we will
haue two tongues, two hearts. Thus crosse are wee to
God, to Nature, to Grace: monstrous men; <hi>monoculi,
monopedes; bicordes, bilingues:</hi> one-eyed, one-footed;
double-tongued, double-hearted. The slaunderer, the

Their eares <hi>surditatem,</hi> they can not heare the Gospell

compasse and latitude: and to inferre, that though <hi>no
man can tame the tongue,</hi> yet a woman may: It is most vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
answere. Woman, for the most part, hath the
glibbest tongue: and if euer this impossibility preclude
man, it shall much more annihilate the power of that
weaker sex.<note place="margin">Prou. 7. 11 and 9. 13</note>

<hi>tamed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And when they are tamed, yet they often haue an
vnruly tricke. <hi>Abraham</hi> lies, <hi>Moses</hi> murmurs, <hi>Elias</hi>
for feare of a Queene and a queane wisheth to die, <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi>
frets for the Gourd, <hi>Dauid</hi> cries in his heart, <hi>All
men are lyers:</hi> which speech rebounded euen on God
himselfe; as if the Lord by <hi>Samuel</hi> had deceiued him:
<hi>Peter</hi> forswears his Master, his Sauiour. If the tongues
of the iust haue thus tripped, how should the profane
goe vpright? <hi>The tongue can no man tame.</hi>

The instruction hence riseth in full strength; that
God onely can tame mans tongue. Now the principall
actions heereof are: first, to open the mouth, when it
should not bee shut: secondly, and to shut it, when it
should not be open.</p>
                     <p>To open our lippes when they should speake, is the
sole worke of God, <hi>Psalme 51. 15 O Lord open thou my
lippes, and then my mouth shall be able to shew forth thy praise.</hi>
God must open with his golden key of grace, or else our
tongues will arrogate a licentious passage. We had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
holde our peace, and let our tongues lie still, then
to set them a running, till God bids them goe. God
commaunds euery sinner to confesse his iniquities: this
charge, <hi>Dauid</hi> knew, concerned himselfe:<note place="margin">Psal. 32. 3</note> yet was <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi>
silent; and then his <hi>bones waxed olde</hi> with anguish.
His adultery cryed, his murder cryed, his ingratitude
cryed for reuenge: but still <hi>Dauid</hi> was mute; and so
long, <hi>day and night the hand of the Lord was heauy vppon
him.</hi> But at last God stopped the mouth of his clamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
aduersaries, and gaue him leaue to speake. <hi>I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
my sinne vnto thee, and mine iniquitie haue I not
hid. I said, I will confesse my transgressions vnto the Lord, and
thou for gauest the iniquity of my sinne.</hi> It is Christ, that must
cast out this <hi>dumbe Diuell.</hi> The Lord is the best opener.
He did <hi>open Lidia's</hi> heart, to conceiue.<note place="margin">Acts 16 2 Kings 6 Esay 50. 5 Coloss. 4. 3</note> He did <hi>open Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaes</hi>
seruants eyes, to see. He did <hi>open</hi> the <hi>Prophets</hi> eares
to heare. He did <hi>open Pauls</hi> tongue, to speake.</p>
                     <p>To shut our lippes, when they should not speake, is
onely the Lords worke also. It is Christ that casts out
the talking Diuell: he shuts the wicket of our mouth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
vnsauoury speeches. Wee may thinke it a high
office (and worthy euen <hi>Dauids</hi> ambition) to be a <hi>doore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper

our <hi>tongues.</hi> Hee that made the <hi>tongue,</hi> can tame the
tongue. He that gaue man a tongue to speake, can giue
him a tongue to speake well. He that placed that <hi>vnruly</hi>
member in his mouth, can giue him a mouth to rule
it. He can giue Psalmes for Carrols; the Songs of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>

of brasse, nor barres of yron to <hi>tame</hi> it: God can. Let
vs moue our tongues, to intreate help for our tongues:
and according to their office, let vs set them on worke
to speake for themselues.</p>
                     <p>2. Wee must not be idle our selues: the difficultie
must spurre vs to more earnest contention. As thou
wouldest keepe thy house from theeues, thy garments
from mothes, thy golde from rust; so carefully preserue
thy tongue from vnrulinesse,<note place="margin">Psal. 141. 3.</note> As <hi>the Lord doth set a watch

So thou must also be vigilant thy selfe, and not turne

                        <hi>How can yee being euill,

if the heart bee meeke, the tongue will bee gentle:
if the heart bee angry, the tongue will bee bitter. The
tongue is but the hand without, to shew how the clocke
goes within. A vaine tongue discouers a vaine heart.
But some haue words soft as butter, when their hearts
are keene swords: bee they neuer so well traded in the

                     <p>I cannot omit the Morall of that old Fable. Three
children call one man Father, who brought them vp.
Dying, he bequeaths all his estate only to one of them,
as his true naturall sonne; but which that one was, left
vncertaine. Heereupon euery one claimes it. The wise

causeth the dead father to be set vp as a marke; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising
the chalengers, that which of them could shoot
next his heart, should enioy the Patrimony. The elder
shootes, so doth the second, both hitte: but when it
came to the yongers turne, he vtterly refused to shoot:
good nature would not let him wound that man dead,
that bred and fed him liuing. Therfore the Iudge gaue

owne kinde: they were <hi>full of poison,</hi> and the poyson of

and shal be tormented with the fire of hell. Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

actiue, this passiue. The rich glutton, that when his
belly was full, could loose his tong to blasphemie, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
water to coole his tongne. His tongue sinned, and
his tongue smarted. Though his torment was vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall,
yet he complaines of his tongue. That panted, that
smoked, that reeked with sulphur and brimstone: that
burnes with the flame of hell dead, that burned with it
liuing. For a former tune of sinne, it hath a present
tune of woe. It scalded, and is scalded: as it cast abroad
the flames of hell in this world, so all the flames of hell
shall bee cast on it in the world to come. It hath fired,
and shall bee fired, with such fire as is not to bee quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched.</p>
