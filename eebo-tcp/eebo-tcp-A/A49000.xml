            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>WHEREAS by a Statute made in the Fifth year of the Reign of the late Queen <hi>ELIZABETH,</hi> containing divers Orders for Servants, (amongſt other Things) It is Enacted, That no Perſon or Perſons that ſhall depart out of a Service, ſhall be retained or accepted into any other Service, without ſhewing before His or Her Retainer ſuch Teſtimonial, as is in the ſaid Statute ſpecified, to the Chief Officer of the Town Corporate, and in every other Town and Place, to the Conſtable, Curate, Churchwarden, or other Head Officer of the ſame, where He or She ſhall be retained to ſerve, upon the pain that every ſuch Servant or Servants ſo departing without ſuch Certificate or Teſtimonial, ſhall be Impriſoned until He or She procure a Teſtimonial or Certificate; The which if He or She cannot do within the ſpace of One and Twenty Days next after the Firſt day of His or Her Impriſonment, Then the ſaid Perſon to be Whipped and uſed as a Vagabond, according to the Laws in ſuch caſe provided. And that any Perſon retaining any ſuch Servant or Servants, without ſhewing any ſuch Teſtimonial or Certificate, as is aforeſaid, ſhall forfeit for every ſuch Offence Five Pounds. And if any ſuch Perſon ſhall be taken with any counterfeit or forged Teſtimonial, then to be Whipped as a Vagabond, as by the ſaid Statute (whereunto relation being had) more fully appeareth. And whereas it is generally Experienced throughout this whole City, as well by the Nobility and Gentry, as other good Citizens and Houſholders Inhabiting in the ſame; That Servants having no ſuch Certificates and Teſtimonials when They depart out of one Service and come to be retained into another Service, and the Neglect of putting the ſaid Law in Execution, giveth great Occaſion to very many Servants to become Idle, Looſe, and of Evil-Behaviour, and oftentimes to Cheat and Purloyn from their Maſters and Miſtreſſes, and when they come to be retained in a Service upon Liking, without a Teſtimonial, take Their firſt Opportunity to run away with their Maſters or Miſtreſſes Goods. It is therefore thought fit, and Ordered by this COURT, That according to the ſaid Statute, No Servant or Servants who ſhall depart out of any Service, ſhall be Retained or Accepted into any other Service without ſhewing ſuch Teſtimonial as aforeſaid. And that the <hi>Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> of the ſeveral Wards within this City do take ſome meet and effectual Courſe for the Publiſhing hereof, to the end all Perſons concerned may take Notice, and may become conformable hereunto.</p>
