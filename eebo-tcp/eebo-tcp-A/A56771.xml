            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOU may remember that when I was
last at <hi>London,</hi> we had a close Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
concerning that deplorable Distemper
called <hi>The Rickets,</hi> which Cripples so many
poor Children, and you told me of a Doctor
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44439:3"/>
of Physick, and one of the Famousest in
<hi>Europe,</hi> had not been able to Cure it in several
of his own Children; indeed it may be called
a new Disease, for it's wonderfully encreased a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us of late, as we find by the Bills of
Mortality. I am very much of your Mind,
that the Knowledge of Physitians would be
much encreased, and their Success would be
much greater, were they more Curious in
making Experiments and Observations of the
Success of simple Medicines, for they cannot
so easily do it upon Compositions. I'le now
tell you what great Cures I have done in my
Countrey Practice, amongst Children who
have been over-grown with the Rickets: The
Specifick that I make use of, is a small white
Seed that comes from <hi>Russia,</hi> by some called <hi>Seed
Manna,</hi> I draw a Tincture, a Spirit and an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
out of it, and give twenty Drops at a time
in all the Childrens Meat and Drink, they take
it with Pleasure, because it's not ungrateful to the
Pallat; Morning, Noon and Night, is often
enough.</p>
            <p>It opens Obstructions of the Liver and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44439:3"/>
Spleen, strengthens the Brain and Spinal Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
and causeth a free Distribution of the
Nourishments into all the Nervous Parts of
the Body, whereby Nature becomes strong and
vigorous, and the Spirits chearful and lively.</p>
            <p>You are pleased to tell the World, in your
Excellent Discourse of the use of simple Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines,
that you hope to enlarge the Minds of
Physitians, and invite them to make use of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Remedies which they never thought on,
or against which they were prejudiced. You
also tell us, that Specificks, where they may be
had, are wont to be free from any immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
manifest Quality, and for the most part
work more benignly as well as more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
than other Medicines; and therefore
you endeavour to bring them into Request,
that so thereby Cures may be performed more
speedily, safely and pleasantly.</p>
            <p>Your Tenderness and Caution is highly to
be commended, in desiring your Reader not
to be too credulous, or rely too much upon
any Medicines that you commend, until they
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44439:4"/>
have been frequently tried upon Persons of
different Sexes, Complections and Ages.</p>
            <p>I am sure that this Seed, and other Specificks
which I have written on, have been tried suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently,
in a multitude of Examples, and with
great Success, which gives great Encouragement
to depend upon it in difficult Cases, with God
Almighty's Blessing.</p>
            <p>I am much of your Mind, that one Reason
why so many Distempers prove incurable, is,
because Physitians do all they can to discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
the use of Specifick Medicines; so that if
they do not always work Wonders, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
tell People that they do nothing at all.</p>
            <p>In Compliance with your Request, I have
found out a Specifick Remedy in almost eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Distemper, which in time may prove as ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious
as the <hi>Cortex</hi> in an Ague, for ought I
know.</p>
            <p>I must say, if at any time I have found Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick
Remedies prove ineffectual, it was when
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44439:4"/>
they were compounded with some insignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
Remedies, or given too late, or administred
in too small a Dose, or left off too soon.</p>
            <p>This small Seed may be given boiled in all
the Childrens Broth or Spoon-meat, or in a
Liquid Form, as the other Specificks use to be.</p>
            <p>I have cured several Children in one Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemans
Family, after gentle Evacuations, when
the Ribbs have been knotted, the Head very
large, the Leggs crooked, the Joynts much
extended, only with this Remedy.</p>
            <p>This Distemper hath spoiled as many Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
as ever <hi>Herod</hi> did, its high time if we
would prevent the destruction of our Innocents,
to find out some more effectual Remedies.
The Method that Dr. <hi>Glisson</hi> and <hi>&amp;c.</hi> found
out, was very good, but this simple Specifick
added to it may make it more effectual.</p>
            <p>You are pleased in your Discourse of spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick
Medicines, to mention the Prickly <hi>Indian
Pear</hi> that I told you of, that communicates its
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44439:5"/>
Tincture so speedily to the Bladder, that it makes
the Eaters think they piss Blood, which gives
a clear Example of the Penetrating Qualities
of some simple Specificks, which have no sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Operation by Vomiting, Purging or
Sweating.</p>
            <p>One of our Judges in his Reports, tells us
of a Learned Doctor who travelled a hundred
Miles, to learn a Specifick of an old Woman
to Cure an Ague. I am sure I have travelled
many thousand Miles to learn all these Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies,
and my design is Publick Good: For
although I am particularly known to you, I
desire to be known to the World by no other
Name, but</p>
