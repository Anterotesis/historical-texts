            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

to be revived,</hi> and unvote the <hi>Votes for the Treaty with the King,</hi>
as prejudiciall and <hi>diſhonourable to the Kingdome,</hi> and likewiſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted
the votes for reſtoring the ten impeached Members.</p>
            <p>Theſe votes being paſſed, the Generall by a party of Horſe and foot
violently ſeized upon Sheriffe <hi>Browne</hi> a Member of the Houſe, and
ſecured him priſoner in St. <hi>Iames,</hi> to a roome without hangings or
bedding: And about 4. of the clocke at night Captain <hi>Lawrence</hi>
the Marſhall of the Army brought a meſſage from the Generall and
his Councell to remove Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> Major Gen. <hi>Maſſey,</hi>
Sir <hi>Iohn Clotworthy,</hi> and Commiſſary <hi>Copley,</hi> from the <hi>Kings
Head</hi> in the <hi>Strand,</hi> where they were ſix dayes impriſoned, to St.
<hi>Iames.</hi> Upon which they expoſtulating with the Marſhall deſired
him to bring an order in writing from the Generall or his <hi>Councel</hi>
for their removall, they having never ſeen nor heard of any war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
from them in writing for their former reſtraint: Whereupon
he repayred to the Gen. &amp; returned with a warrant under his hand
for their removeall to St <hi>Iames</hi> about 6 of the clock. Upon reading
whereof, they read a Proteſtation drawn up in writing and ſigned
with all their hands to this effect: <hi>That they being Members of
Parliament and Free men of England did proteſt before God, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells
and Men, that neither the Generall himſelfe nor his Councell
of Warre, had any power or authority to ſeize, detaine, impriſon, or
remove their perſons, nor to try them by a Councell of War: And
that they had uſurped to themſelves a greater Arbitrary power
over the Members of Parliament, and Freemen of this Realme
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:162531:4"/>
then ever this or any other King of England had arrogated to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>And that though they neither would nor could ſubmit
to their uſurped power, yet they would alwayes be ready to ſubmit
themſelves to any tryall by a free Parliament, for any crime that
could or ſhould be ſuggeſted against them.</hi> Which when they had
read, they tendred to the Marſhall to deliver it to the Generall
and his Councell, who refuſed to receive and left it upon the Table.
Some other Members there preſent, alleadged to the Marſhall,
That theſe proceedings of the Army againſt the Members by mere
power without any Authority at all, (by which alone the Marſhall
there openly affirmed the Generall and Officers now proceeded)
<hi>was as bad or worſe then that of the Great Turke or Ianizaries.
That it was a farre more arbitrary and tyrannicall power
then ever the King or his evill Councellors, or the most perſecuting
Courts and Prelates uſurped or exerciſed, and that all their tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
oppreſſion and injustice was not comparable to theirs: That
this was that the Officers and Army proteſted against in all their
Declarations,</hi> and profeſſed <hi>they had fought againſt, and therefore
it was monſtrous themſelves should exerciſe ſuch Tyranny, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice
now even upon Members themſelves, and how then would
they tyrannize it over others?</hi> The ſtanders by were deeply affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
with this new monſtrous tyranny and perſecution of Gallant
Members and Commanders, who had done ſuch brave ſervices for
their Countrey, and were thus toſſed up and down at the lawleſſe
pleaſure of ignoble and degenerous uſurpers of more then regall
power, from priſon to priſon, and accompanying them to the coach
and there taking their farewells of them, they were guarded with
Muſquetiers and carried in the dark to Saint <hi>Iames</hi> priſoners, and
there ſhut up in a foul room where the Souldiers had layne ſome
nights before, without hangings or bedding to reſt their heads upon,
where they muſt lye all night upon the boards as they did in
Hell, if not otherwiſe provided for.</p>
            <p>Certainly if theſe proud Officers of the Army, and Monſters of
Tyranny had not caſt off all Humanity, all Chriſtianity, all fear, all
love of God or men, and that Nobleneſſe and ingenuity, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
to the rudeſt Soldiars towards Soldiers and Gallant Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:162531:4"/>
in the Wars as theſe Gentlemen have bin, and quite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated,
into beaſts, they could not ſhew ſuch unheard of cruelty
and inhumanity to theſe Honourable Members and Patriots of
their Countrey, and uſe them more barbarouſly though their maſters
and freinds, then uſually they did the worſt Cavaliers, or then the
King himſelfe and his ſouldiers would have treated them, had they
taken them Priſoners in the field.</p>
            <p>Doubtleſſe this moſt execrable tyranny of theſe new Kings &amp; Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants
at White-hall will engage both Heaven &amp; earth unanimouſly
againſt them, and bring them unto fearfull ends and ſpeedy ruine,
if they repent not, and returne to their priſtine obedience. And
their Commiſſions being forfeited &amp; nulled, the Soldiers abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſcharged from any obedience to them, the Parliament from
any protection of them, the Kingdome from all contributions and
taxes towards them, and the Members, Kingdome and God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe

have endeavoured to ſubvert them, and brought them to a diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable
and ſhamefull end.</p>
            <p>Wedneſday the 13 of December, the Officers of the Army kept
out Sir <hi>Iohn Hippeſley</hi> and Mr. <hi>Packer,</hi> and would not permit them
to enter the Houſe; where they repealed the vote of the Commons
on Munday the 4. of December, That the King was removed from
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:162531:5"/>
the Iſle of Wight without the Privity or conſent of the Houſe:
There were out 45. in the houſe to repeal this vote paſſed by 240.
and thoſe 45 are very eminent for their extream honeſty, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
receipts of the Kingdomes Treaſure. After which the Army
Hackneyes repealed likewiſe the vote of the fifth of December
laſt paſſed by above 141 votes, that the Kings Anſwer to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
were a ſufficient ground for them to proced to the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement
of the Kingdome, which they deſire to embroyle in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
wars and broyles, that they may keep their Offices, and what
they have gotten into their hands by hook or crook: whiles thoſe
who have ſpent their eſtates and adventured their lives in theſe wars
and have more honeſty in their little fingers, then thoſe that ſit in
their whole bodies, are impriſoned and reſtrained from the Houſe
by a company of Rebells, againſt their Superiours, to give them
no worſe Title.</p>
            <p>Thurſday the 4th. of <hi>December,</hi> the fagge end of the Commons
being about 43. in number, conſidering that all the beſt and honeſt
men were ſecluded from them by the Army, and proteſted they
were no Houſe, moved that they might ſend to the Generall <hi>to
