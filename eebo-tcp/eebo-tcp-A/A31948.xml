         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Ruſty and well-beloved, Wee
greet you well. We call to
mind, that in former times the
conſtant Cuſtome was, by the
Mouth of the Lord Keeper for
the time being, at the Court of
<hi>Star-chamber,</hi> in the end of <hi>Trinity</hi> Terme, to put
the Judges of Aſsize (ſhortly after to undertake
their ſeverall Circuits,) in mind of ſuch things as
were then thought neceſſary for the preſent, for
the good government of the Kingdome. This
courſe in Our Judgement<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We doe ſo well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
of, that although We want that oportunity
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42707:3"/>
which We and Our Predeceſſors then had, of
Communicating Our thoughts to Our Iudges,
for the good of Our People: yet We doe ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
the ſame care for the ſafety and proſperity
of Our good Subjects; And much more by how
much the diſtempers and diſtractions of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
times, unhappily fallen, have given Us more
occaſion. We have therefore thought it fit to
ſupply this defect by theſe Our Letters; wherein
beſide the generall care of Our Iuſtice commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to Us by God, and by Us delegated to Our
Iudges by Our ſeverall Commiſsions, We re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
unto you in your Circuit, as We ſhall
doe to the reſt of your Brethren in their ſeverall
Circuits, more eſpecially theſe particulars fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That ye take care by all the beſt meanes
you can, to ſuppreſſe Popery in all thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
whither you are to goe, by putting the
Lawes made againſt them in due execution:
And that you take the like care to give a ſtoppe
to the overhaſty growth of Anabaptiſme, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Schiſmes, as farre as by the good Lawes of
this Land you may, and to puniſh the delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents
with an equall hand; and thoſe eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of either ſort, whom you ſhall diſcover to be
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:42707:3"/>
ſeditiouſly ſtirrers and moters of others, to any
Act of diſobedience to Us, and to Our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And that in your Charges and otherwiſe,
as you ſhall have fit opportunity, you aſſure Our
good Subjects in Our name, and in the word of
a King (who calls God to witneſſe of His inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity
and ſincerity therein) That by His gratious
aſsiſtance, We are conſtantly reſolved to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the true Proteſtant Religion eſtabliſhed by
Law in this Church of England, in the purity
thereof, without declining either to the right
hand or to the left, as We found it at Our Acceſſe
to the Crowne, and as it was maintained in the
happy times of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and King <hi>Iames</hi>
(Our deer Father) both of happy memory; and
therein both to live and dye.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> you ſhall let Our people of thoſe
Counties know, That according to Our Kingly
duty and Oath, We are alſo conſtantly reſolved to
maintain the Lawes of this Our Kingdom, and
by, and according to them, to governe Our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and not by any Arbitrary power, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the malevolent Spirits of any ill-affected to
Our Perſon, or Government have ſuggeſted, or
ſhall ſuggeſt to the contrary; and that we ſhall
alſo maintain the Juſt Priviledges of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42707:4"/>
as farre as any of Our Predeceſſors have
done, and as farre as may ſtand with that Iuſtice
which We owe to Our Crowne, and to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
thereof. But that We may not, nor will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of any ſuch unwarranted power in either
or both houſes of Parliament, which in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things
hath been lately uſurped, not only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
but againſt Our Royall Conſent and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand;
And We require and Command you, as
there ſhall be juſt occaſion offered, in a legall
way, that you take care to preſerve Our juſt
Right in thoſe Caſes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We charge you, as you tender the
Peace of the Kingdom, (in the government
whereof, according to Our Lawes, you Our
Judges of the Law have a principall part under
Us) that you take care for the ſuppreſsing of all
Inſurrections (if any ſuch ſhould happen) and
of all Riots, and unlawfull Aſſemblies, under a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
pretence whatſoever, not warranted by the
Lawes of the Land, and whoſoever ſhall tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe
therein, that you let them know, that they
muſt expect that puniſhment which by the Law
may be inflicted upon them, and at your hands
We ſhall look for ſuch an accompt herein, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
your Circuit, as becometh the quality of the
place wherein you ſerve Us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:42707:4"/>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Becauſe theſe diſtempers of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
times, unhappily ſtirred up, and fomented by
ſome, under ſpecious, but unjuſt pretences, are
probable to ſtirre up looſe and ungoverned per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
under hope of impunity, as farre as they
dare, to make a prey of Our good Subjects, We
ſtrictly charge and command you to take the
beſt order you can in thoſe Counties, that
Rogues and Vagabonds, and other diſorderly
people may be apprehended, dealt with, &amp; puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
according to the Lawes, whereby the good
and quiet People of Our Kingdom may be ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and the wicked and licentious may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed.
And We Charge and Command you
to give it in Charge in all the Counties whither
you are ſent by Our Commiſſions, that Watches
and Wards, be ſtrictly kept in all Pariſhes &amp; Places
convenient, whereby the Lawes made againſt
ſuch diſorders may be put in due execution.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fiftly and lastly,</hi> you ſhall let Our People of
thoſe Counties know from Us, and by Our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
That if they ſhall preferre unto Us, or
unto you in Our ſtead, any thing wherein they
hold themſelves grieved, in an humble and fitting
way, and ſhall deſire a juſt reformation or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe,
We ſhall give a gratious Eare unto them,
and with all conveniency return them ſuch an
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42707:5"/>
Anſwer, as ſhall give them cauſe to thank Us for
Our Juſtice and Favour.</p>
            <p>And when ye ſhall have publiſhed Our cleer
intentions to Our People in theſe things, leaſt, at
the firſt hearing, they ſhould not ſo fully appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
Our ſence therein, you ſhall deliver a Copy
of theſe Our Letters to the Foreman of the
Grand-jury, and to any other, if any ſhall deſire
Copies of theſe Our Letters for their better infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
you may deliver the ſame.</p>
            <p>And to the end that Our Service in your Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit
may not ſuffer through the abſence of Our
learned Councell; Our will and Command is,
That you aſsigne in every place of your Seſsions
ſome of the ableſt Lawyers who ride that Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit,
to be of Councell for Us, to aſsiſt in ſuch
pleas of the Crowne, as may be moſt neceſſary
for Our ſervice, in the examination and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of notorious delinquents.</p>
            <p>Of all theſe things We ſhall expect that good Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt
from you, as We ſhall from the reſt of your
Brethren Our Iudges, to whom We have alſo
written to the like purpoſe, (of whoſe fidelity and
good affections We are confident,) as becometh
Us to look for from you, and for you to render
to Us, from whom you have ſo great a truſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
            <p>Given at Our Court at <hi>YORKE</hi> the 5 of <hi>Iuly</hi> 1641.</p>
