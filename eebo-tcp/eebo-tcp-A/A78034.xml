         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But for all your provocations throughout your Books, Brother, you ſhall not finde with me ſo much as a white ſtaffe to lift up againſt you, though you charge us (but how juſtly)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we have the ſword in our hands. Nor doe I purpoſe to retort, or retaliate your little expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and leſſe deſerved calumnies, leſt I ſhould therein be like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you: but I ſhall anſwer you in the words of truth and ſober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and in the ſpirit of meekneſſe and love.</p>
            <p>But how comes it to paſſe, that my two fellow-ſufferers, and my ſelfe, ſhould fall at this odds? Was it by any divine providence ominated or preſaged, by your two ſtandings on one Pillary, and mine alone in the other, that wee ſhould now come upon one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Theatre to become ſpectacles to the world, by mutuall digladiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as if the one Pillary ſhould contend with the other?

But, herein at leaſt ever be we a threefold coard, not eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly broken. But the will of the Lord be done, who is onely wiſe, and will cauſe all things to co-operate for good to them that love him.</p>
            <p>But Brothers, we expected, that (according to your own words, <hi>pag.</hi> 7.) you would have acted the part of a Moderator between us. But inſtead thereof we find you a Judge, and that a ſevere one too; but how juſtly, I leave to others to judge. For in your promiſed, or rather menaced <hi>Poſtſcript,</hi> which (to foreſtall your Readers with a prejudicate opinion of us; and old piece of Rhetoricke, as that of <hi>Tertullus</hi> before <hi>Felix,</hi> telling him of <hi>Paul; Wee have found this man</hi>

            <p>On the other ſide; The Churches which you call <hi>Independent,</hi> are alſo <hi>Dependent.</hi> Firſt, They are not otherwiſe <hi>Independent,</hi> then firſt, that they are not, nor ought (in reſpect of Doctrine, Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, Worſhip, Church-Government) to depend upon humane Lawes, Canons, Decrees, Cuſtomes; but onely upon Chriſt and his Lawes; as wherein they aſſert and hold forth Chriſts Kingly Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and Government over them; and doe affirme, that to ſet up humane formes of worſhip and Church-Government, unto which the conſciences and ſoules of Gods people muſt neceſſarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme and be ſubject, is a dethroning of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and a denying him to be the onely King of his Church Secondly, <hi>Independent</hi> in this reſpect, becauſe every particular viſible Church, rightly conſtituted according to the Word of God, depends not directly and neceſſarily upon any other Church or Churches, as without whoſe juriſdiction (call it <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> or what you will) it may not exerciſe all that power, which Chriſt hath given to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular Church, as touching all the Offices and Ordinances thereof, and that in as ample manner, as if there were beſides that one, no other Churches in the World.</p>
            <p>And yet ſecondly, This Church thus <hi>Independent,</hi> is alſo <hi>Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</hi> For, as it depends abſolutely upon Chriſt, as the onely Head of this Body; ſo as it is a member-church of the Catholick, and a ſiſter-church of all particular Churches, with which it makes up one body, and one Spouſe of Chriſt her Head and Husband: ſo it hath a mutuall dependence upon all true Churches, for communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for conſociation, for conſultation, for comfort, for ſupport; though alwayes ſaving and retaining to it ſelfe all thoſe Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priviledges, which by Chriſts Charter are peculiar to every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church, and body of Jeſus Chriſt.

Church doe any act of cenſure upon any, who thereby ſhall thinke himſelfe wronged, and ſhall addreſſe himſelfe to other Churches, by way of complaint, and they ſhall thereupon deſire of that church an account of their proceedings therein, this church will not refuſe, but as in Chriſtian duty bound, will to thoſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches render a reaſon of that, or any other their doings, if queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and lawfully required. And all this in a ſweet and loving way, with meekneſſe and feare, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 15. ſo as none is debarred of any ſuch appeale. Nor is any well conſtituted Church of Chriſt to be conceived ſo brutiſh, or ſo conceited of her ſelfe, as to thinke ſhee may not erre, or her ſelfe ſo wiſe, as in many difficult caſes not to need the counſell of others, or ſo inflexible, as with the Stoicks, <hi>Sententiam mutare nunquam; nullius rei poenitere;</hi> never to change<note place="margin">Cicer.

But what if one particular Church will not, after all due meanes uſed, (which yet no rationall man can imagine will ever come to paſſe) hearken to the unanimous judgement and counſell of the other Churches? What is to be done? Surely they may upon juſt cauſe withdraw communion from that Church, which, in that caſe, is the higheſt cenſure the Churches can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed<note place="margin">Act. 24. 25, 26 Joh. 18. 28.

But there will be a better care had of placing good <hi>Presbyters.</hi> But Brother, let us firſt ſee it, that ſo your <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Government may ſhew us a face the more amiable, and leſſe formidable to all truly godly, and moſt conſcientious men. But if you cannot doe this, whither ſhall the poore ſoules goe, which live under a prophane <hi>Presbyter,</hi> or one that admits all ſorts tag rag to the Lords Table, with whom god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſoules can no more converſe, then with Heathen; and much leſſe at that holy Ordinance, where they muſt be made companions with ſuch kinde of Saints, as <hi>Job</hi> would not ſet with the dogs of his flocke: And if any whoſe conſcience is not ſo ſtrong to digeſt ſuch hard bits, as others of the common multitude are, who either ſee no difference at all between the precious and the vile; (but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count all alike Saints at leaſt, when but at the Sacrament) or have ſuch Sepulchre-wide throats, as they can ſwallow a Camell, when a tender and more narrow conſcience is apt to be choaked with every Gnat: What ſhall this poore ſoule doe?

Now if you have not a good <hi>Presbytery,</hi> where ſhall he goe to complaine? He may goe and appeale higher, you will ſay. And what if the higher the worſe? Good Brother, either provide

the people of the Land an honeſt godly <hi>Presbytery,</hi> that may be as ſo many Angels to gather out of Chriſts Kingdome every thing that offends: or elſe let there be a tender care of tender conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and ſome proviſion made for them, that they may not be ſcandalized, by being forced to be the companions of the ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. And therefore Brother, you that profeſſe ſo much ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous care to poore bodies, let ſome drops of your charity fall upon their ſoules. And at the leaſt, and laſt extremity, call in that <hi>Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript</hi> of yours, and ſuppreſſe it in the Preſſe, that it may never ſee the Sunne; as wherein you proſcribe all thoſe, that are not of your <hi>Dependent Presbytery:</hi> for you tell us, it is to come forth a fortnight hence, in the which it will be proved, that it is the duty of all chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Magiſtrates, Parents, Maſters of families, and all ſuch as tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly feare God, to yeeld their hand for the ſuppreſſing of hereſies, and all novelties in Religion, if they really deſire the glory of God, &amp;c. And what you meane by your hereſies and novelties in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, is obvious to all by this your Booke already come forth, <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency</hi> is hereſie, and novelty in Religion, and what not, that nought is? Now did ever proceed out of the mouth of a <hi>quondam</hi>-Martyr, and one newly brought out of a balefull priſon, ſuch a fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry breath as this? Oh Brother, remember thy ſelfe, and repent; and let the world know, that thou haſt made a better uſe of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, then ſo fiercely to run on in ſuch a courſe, as to wreck the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity of a priſon upon thy beſt friends, the ſeed of whoſe love, ſo liberally ſowne upon thee and thine, expected another-gates harveſt, then nettles, bryars, and thornes.</p>
            <p>But you bring the Scripture for you. Come on, Brother, let you and me try it out by the dint of this ſword. And truly, I ſhall by the helpe of my God make no long worke of it.

            <p>For anſwer. Firſt, let me aske you a Queſtion: Whether thoſe many Congregations you ſo call, you doe not underſtand to be ſo many diſtinct, and particular intire Church-bodies, or Churches

reſpectively. If they be, tell us, if each of theſe Churches be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               </gap> its prime and proper notion an intire Church, without or before it be united in ſuch a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Combination, and Government, as you ſpeake of. And if ſo, whether it be <hi>de eſſe,</hi> or <hi>de bene eſſe,</hi> of the being, or onely well-being of each particular Church, ſo to be united, and combined into a Church-collective, of many Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches into one. If you ſay, it is of the being of a Church, to be yoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with other Churches, as into one, then what being had that Church in <hi>Abrahams</hi> family, ſeeing there were then no other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in the world, but that? And if that were extraordinary, (as perhaps you will ſay) then ſay I, when Churches are multiplied, and combined into one, whether is this Church collective <hi>Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi> or <hi>Independent?</hi> If <hi>Dependent,</hi> then not an entire Church, but ſubordinate unto, or depending upon ſome greater Aſſembly. But come we to the higheſt of all, a generall Counſell of all the Churches in the world: is this now, a Church <hi>Dependent,</hi> or <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent?</hi> If <hi>Independent,</hi> then there may be a Church <hi>Independent</hi> in the world; and ſo the firſt particular Church in the world, was no leſſe an <hi>Independent</hi> Church, in reference to other Churches. And if all Churches in one Oecumenicall Councell, as one Church, be <hi>Dependent,</hi> then whereupon <hi>Dependent?</hi> Or is it a <hi>Dependent</hi> on it ſelfe? That were blaſphemy to ſay it. Whereon then? Surely on the Scripture or nothing. All Churches then are <hi>Dependent</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Scripture neceſſarily: not ſo neceſſarily one Church upon another, whether particular or generall. <hi>Ergo,</hi> all particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches being not neceſſarily dependent one upon another, nor one upon many, but abſolutely dependent upon the Scripture for their ultimate or finall reſolutions, are no leſſe <hi>Independent</hi> upon other Churches; becauſe all the Churches in the world put together, cannot of themſelves give forth an infallible Oracle; as to ſay, this wee command to be beleeved and obſerved. This is Antichriſts voyce, <hi>Volumus &amp; jubenius.</hi> The Church, or Churches may ſhew<note place="margin">Platina: in vita Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facii 3.</note> their reaſons from Scripture, and labour to perſwade, but cannot binde them upon faith or conſcience; this the Holy Ghoſt and Scripture can onely doe.</p>
            <p>But I come briefly to your Arguments, whereby you would prove your Claſſicall <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Government, and ſo upward. The patterne hereof you take from the Chriſtian Church at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:113213:7"/>
Hereof many arguments, or rather words, and tantologies you multiply, and toyle your ſelfe and vex your Reader withall, which you might have reduced to one. It is in ſumme, this:</p>
            <p>In <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> were many Chriſtian Congregations, and all theſe made but one Church, and ſo were governed by one <hi>Presbytery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that Church at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> being the prime Apoſtolicke Church, is a patterne for all ſucceeding Churches:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ergo,</hi> all Church-government ought to be regulated by that, and conſequently by a <hi>Presbytery</hi> over many Congregations.</p>
            <p>For as for your indefinite enumeration of thoſe multitudes bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized by <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> and by Chriſts Diſciples, we take no notice of them, unleſſe formed into a Church, or Churches: but follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the expreſſe Scripture, the firſt formed Church wee finde in <hi>Act.</hi> 2. which though conſiſting of five thouſand, yet it was one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire particular Church, and not Churches; and they continued daily <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, with one accord in one place toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, (<hi>ver.</hi> 2.) and in the Temple, (<hi>ver.</hi> 44. 46.) growing from a hundred and twenty (<hi>Act.</hi> 1. 15.) to three thouſand more, (<hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 41.) and then in all five thouſand (<hi>Chap.</hi> 4. 4.) and all theſe but one Church, which aſſembled together to heare the word in the Temple; and though they wanted a convenient place ſo ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, as wherein to breake bread, or receive the Lords Supper all together, ſo as they were conſtrained to ſever themſelves into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers companies, in ſeverall private houſes to communicate, yet this ſevering was not a dividing of the Church into ſo many diſtinct formall Churches, or Church-bodies, being but ſo many bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of one and the ſame particular Church; which though you call ſo many Congregations, yet properly ſo many Churches they were not. And therefore you never read, The Churches at or in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but, The Church at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And this no Nationall Church neither, witneſſe thoſe Churches in <hi>Judea,</hi> Gal. 1. 22.</p>
            <p>Whereupon I anſwer to your Argument; and firſt to your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. I deny that thoſe Congregations you name, are ſo many Churches, properly ſo called, having their diſtinct Officers and members, united into one Church-body reſpectively. This I put you to prove. And without proving it, your 11 or 12 ſhee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> ſpent about this Argument prove to be meere waſt paper. And for your Aſſumption, that the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as being a prime Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicke
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:113213:8"/>
Church, is therefore a patterne for all ſucceeding Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and therefore for a Claſſicall <hi>Presbytery</hi> over many Churches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you muſt firſt prove your Propoſition, as before, that there were many Churches in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> conſtituted in their diſtinct formes, and bodies. Secondly, it being no more, then one entire particular Church (and not any Dioceſan, or Provinciall Church, or the <hi>Presbytery</hi> thereof Claſſicall, (as you would beare us in hand) it is a patterne for all particular Churches in ſucceeding ages; and yet (by your favour) not ſo perfect a patterne, as no Apoſtolicke Church beſides it ſhould alſo come in, to make up the patterne compleat. For we are neceſſarily to take all the Churches in the New Teſtament together, to make up one entire &amp; perfect Church patterne. For in the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> we finde election of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, but we finde not expreſſed that part of Diſcipline; for caſting out of corrupt members, as in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and ſo in the reſt. For the Churches were not brought forth to full perfection in one day. Their very conſtitution had a graduall growth. The Church at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> had not at firſt Deacons, till there was a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie; and the largeneſſe of the Church required ſeven Deacons; which is no patterne for every Church to have ſeven Deacons. The ſumme is, to make up a compleat patterne, not onely the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but that of <hi>Corinth,</hi> of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> thoſe of <hi>Gal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> that of <hi>Philippi,</hi> and the reſt; are to be conferred together, that each may caſt in its ſhot to make up the full reckoning, that ſo what is not expreſſed in one, may be ſupplied by the reſt, to make one entire platforme. For the Scripture conſiſts of many Books, as ſo many members in one body; one member cannot ſay to another, <note n="*" place="margin">1. Cor. 12.</note> 
               <hi>I have no need of thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> if it muſt be a patterne for all other Churches, then in this, that all other Churches muſt be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to ſome one Church, becauſe (<hi>Act.</hi> 15.) things in queſtion were there debated, and determined, and ſent to other Churches to be obſerved. But for as much as that Church at that time in thoſe things was infallibly guided by the Holy Ghoſt, wherewith the Apoſtles there were inſpired, in which reſpect their reſolutions were with Authoritie, <hi>It pleaſed the Holy Ghoſt and us,</hi> (that which no particular Church ſince the Apoſtles could ever ſay) it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that the Church then at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> remaines not in all things a
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:113213:8"/>
patterne for other Churches; for a patterne muſt be in all things imitable, and perfect.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, for Appeales, ſo much agitated, and preſſed, I have ſaid enough before, and elſewhere (as in my Vindication) to vindicate<note place="margin">Page 98.</note> the right uſe of that in point of Church matters. And ſo I paſſe briefly from your firſt Queſtion to your ſecond; which is concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the manner of gathering of Churches, and admitting members and Officers: <hi>Viz:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether Miniſters of the Goſpel may, out of already congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated<note place="margin">To the ſecond Queſtion.</note> Aſſemblies of believers, ſelect and chooſe the moſt principall of them into a Church-fellowſhip peculiar unto themſelves, and admit of none into their ſocietie, but ſuch as ſhall enter in by a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate covenant, and are allowed of by the conſent and approbation of all the Congregation.</p>
            <p>This is your generall ſtating of your Queſtion; and out of the wombe thereof, there doth iſſue a numerous brood, no leſſe then ſix <hi>Queries,</hi> or if you will (to uſurpe your owne uſuall expreſſion) ſo many ſucking Queſtions, hanging at the dugs of their damme, your generall Queſtion.</p>
            <p>For anſwer to all in their order: But before I anſwer, let mee<note place="margin">Page 14.</note> premiſe thus much: Brother, I well ſee (and that without ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles) that among all thoſe <hi>Independents</hi> whom you ſo familiarly hurle ſtones at, and caſt up duſt, yea durt in their faces, I am not the leaſt object in your eye, as by many palpable paſſages in your Booke doth appeare. And therefore I ſhall crave leave, that I may have the favour to repreſent and perſonate all thoſe my Brethren the Miniſters, whom Giantlike you revile and challenge, and warre againſt under the name of <hi>Independents,</hi> as taking this take upon my ſelfe alone, in anſwering this your Queſtion about gathering of Churches.</p>
            <p>Firſt then to your generall ſtating of the Queſtion. You ſay, it concernes the manner of gathering. Do you imply here the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of the matter of gathering, by queſtioning onely the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner? Your words may ſeeme to import ſo much. But I will not quarrell a word. I come to your Queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether Miniſters of the Goſpel, &amp;c. Surely if any, then Miniſters of the Goſpel may gather Churches: and that for two reaſons; firſt, becauſe by the Goſpel, &amp; the Miniſtry thereof, Churches are gathered to Chriſt.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:113213:9"/>
Secondly, becauſe we read, that the Apoſtles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and other Miniſters of the Goſpel have by their Miniſtry gathered Churches.</p>
            <p>Therefore no queſtion, but if any, then Miniſters of the Goſpel may gather Churches to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>I, but out of already congregated Aſſemblies of Believers, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and chooſe the moſt principall of them. Indeed this is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to purpoſe. But tell me, Brother<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who is it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that doth this? You apply it to us all, and to me in particular. But I deny that I ſo doe, and I dare ſay the like for others. And can you prove all thoſe Pariſhes, out of which Churches are ſo gathered, as you ſay, to be Aſſemblies of believers? But they all profeſſe to be Chriſtians. True, ſo doe all Papiſts. <hi>Ergo,</hi> are all Popiſh Pariſhes, Aſſemblies of Believers? So as if Miniſters of the Goſpel ſhould by their prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching convert ſundry Papiſts of ſeverall Popiſh Pariſhes to become a Church of Chriſt, ſhould they gather ſuch a Church out of ſo many Aſſemblies of believers?</p>
            <p>But (ſay you) <hi>wee gather Churches out of Aſſemblies of believing Proteſtants.</hi> Why Brother, doe you not know this to be a time of Reformation? And have we not all taken the ſolemne Covenant to reform our ſelves and others, according to the word of God? And to endeavour to our power, to extirpate and roote out all Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, Prelacy, Idolatry and Superſtition out of this Kingdome? And the time of this firſt gathering, was it not then, when the old ſervice and ceremonies were in uſe? And who hath gathered theſe Churches? Wee. Who are we that you ſhould thus charge us? As <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> anſwered, <hi>Why looke yee ſo on us?</hi> So, why doe yee impute that to us, which is onely to be attributed to the Goſpel of the grace of God, whereby our very Proteſtants are wonne from their old ſuperſtitions, and will-worſhip, and from under the yoake of humane formes in the matters of Chriſts Kingdome? So as when they heare, Chriſt is the onely King of his Kingdome, the onely Law-giver of his Church, and his Word the onely law and rule of all Church-government, and all this demonſtrated in the Word of God, which they have taken a ſolemne Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in all things to follow: doe you reproach us, for being a people who are ready to obey Chriſt, ſo ſoone as wee heare of<note place="margin">Pſal. 18. Acts 3. 22<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> him, who alone is to be heard in all things, whatſoever he ſhall ſay unto us?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:113213:9"/>And for Churches, doe you, Brother, limit Churches to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes? What if you finde ſo many hundred Pariſhes in <hi>England,</hi> whoſe Inhabitants both Miniſters and people are all Malignants, or popiſhly-affected? Will you have thoſe Pariſhes to be ſo many Churches, and thoſe popiſh Malignants, ſo many believers? Were not this to ſet up <hi>Eccleſiam malignantium,</hi> or Churches malignant, which are no way militant, but againſt the power of Religion, and the peace of the civill State? Or if there be found ſome one or two in each of thoſe Pariſhes, that have the love of Chriſt in them, and are truly godly, and whoſe ſoules are grieved to communicate with <hi>Sodome:</hi> Will you not allow God to ſend an Angel, his Meſſenger, with a word to call them forth? And doe you not know, that the ancient Church of the <hi>Jewes</hi> was then a Church, when the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles<note place="margin">Acts 2.</note> by their preaching gathered a Church out of it? A Chriſtian Church out of the <hi>Jewes</hi> Synagogue?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I,</hi> ſay you, <hi>but we gather Chriſtian Churches out of Chriſtian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</hi> Surely then it is Gods word that calleth Chriſtians to come into a more reformed Church-way, out of wayes more corrupt and leſſe reformed. Nor doe wee ſeparate from the Churches as Chriſtian, as you call them, but from their corruptions, * <hi>ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi>

               <hi>the precious from the vile, as from ſomething Antichriſtian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you will ſay, Now are the Pariſhes and Churches purged, no Service-book now, no Hierarchy, no ſuch thing, and yet wee ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and chooſe the moſt principall into a Church-fellowſhip pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar unto our ſelves. To which I anſwer: Though the Service-book, Hierarchy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be taken away, yet the Pariſhes are not ſo purged of them, but that moſt mens hearts are ſtill hankering after that Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian-ſervice and Task-maſters. Again, all thoſe that profeſſe to be come off from thoſe things, yet are not reſolved what Religion to take to, but are ready to take up (as themſelves ſay, and do) what Religion men will ſet up over them, not looking to what the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture preſcribes and commands; ſo as it remains, that thoſe who embrace the Word, and preferre Chriſts Decrees before mans, are thoſe principall men, whom not we, but the Word of Chriſt doth call forth, ſelect and chooſe voluntarily to joyn in Church-fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and this not ſo peculiar to our ſelves, but that when a right Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation is ſet up in the ſeverall places where they dwell, they may enjoy the pure Ordinances there, as I have ſhewed in my <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication.</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:113213:10"/>
And if you examine who they be that have joyned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto the Lord, either of this pariſh, or of other, you ſhall find<note place="margin">Eſa. 56. 3.</note> them to be for their outward eſtate, (in compariſon of others) none of thoſe principall men you ſpeak of.</p>
            <p>But ſay you, <hi>wee admit of none into our ſociety, but ſuch as ſhall enter in by a private Covenant.</hi> Now the very name of Covenant is become a bug-bear to many. But it is mightily miſtaken, as I have ſhewed in my <hi>Vindication:</hi> For it is nothing elſe, but a declaration of a free aſſent, and voluntary agreement to walk in the wayes of Chriſt with the Church, whereof they are members, and to perform all ſervice of love one to another, ſubmitting themſelves to the Order and Ordinance of Chriſt, in that Church reſpectively. So that it is not the name of Covenant that is ſo terrible, but the Order of Church-communion; and this to thoſe only, that having uſed to walk without a yoak (as the Scripture calls ſons of <hi>Belial</hi>) love not to come under the yoak of Chriſt, then which to a willing bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer nothing is more eaſie and ſweet.</p>
            <p>But laſtly, you ſay, <hi>they muſt be allowed of by the conſent and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of all the Congregation.</hi> And (I pray) what harm in that? Nay, doth it not ſtand with very good reaſon, that they who are to walk together, ſhould firſt be agreed together? As <hi>Amos 3. 3. Can two walk together, except they be agreed?</hi> If therefore any one of the Congregation can object any thing, as a juſt cauſe of non-admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of a member, he ought to ſhew it, not only for his own peace, but the peace of the Church. Therefore, to object ſuch things as theſe, doth it argue a ſpirit favouring of ſuch a holy humility, as becomes thoſe who affect the ſociety of Saints? And when the whole church gives approbation in this kind, it is both to the church and the member admitted, a comfort, and withall, a diſcharge of their duty in a provident care for preventing inconveniences and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals;<note place="margin">Turpius ejici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, quàm non admittitur boſpes.</note> ſeeing it is eaſier for a gueſt to be kept out, then to be caſt out. Thus much of your Queſtion in generall; which becauſe I have met with it in the ſeverall branches, I ſhall need to ſay the leſſe to thoſe Queries which you derive from it.

            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 101. you ſay, <hi>The Apoſtles, and other Miniſters of the Goſpell were to receive all ſuch as believed, and were baptized, and that upon the profeſſion of their faith and repentance, without any further teſtimony of others, unleſſe they had been formerly known to be open enemies, and then they were juſtly to be ſuſpected, till they had given publique evidence by witneſſe to the Apoſtles and Miniſters of their true converſion, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning</hi> Paul, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 26, 27.</p>
            <p>Now here I obſerve:</p>
            <p>1. A notable contradiction to what you ſay, <hi>pag.</hi> 115. As Gods command to all Miniſters was, that they ſhould admit all ſuch into the Church, as believed and were baptized, upon their deſiring it, without any confeſſion, either private or publique.

               </gap>ender them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be admitted into ſuch Churches, as are of a conſtitution moſt agreeable to the law and rule of Chriſt. And withall, an impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit profeſſion at leaſt of their repentance is included, as having for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly lived under an Antichriſtian government, and inventions of will-worſhip, all which is implicitly profeſſed and repented of, by their very entrance into Church-fellowſhip; and ſo much the more is repentance herein needfull, becauſe many, yea moſt of ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts, if not all, have had their hands, leſſe or more, either by acting, or aſſenting, or by ſilence and connivence in the perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe godly Miniſters and people, which ſtood out againſt that Antichriſtian uſurpation over their conſciences, refuſing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to their Canons. So as in this caſe, you confeſſe, that our people (formerly Conformiſts, and now, for the greater part, but newly crope out of the ſhell of their bondage, being brought off from their old ceremoniall ſervice, and this more by humane au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in generall ſo ordering, then of conſcience) ought not only to approve themſelves by the profeſſion of their faith, and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, but to have the teſtimony of others alſo, as having been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly known to be either preſt and ſworn vaſſals, or voluntiers in the Prelaticall <hi>Militia,</hi> which what is it elſe, but a continuall war againſt the true Church and Kingdome of Jeſus Chriſt?</p>
            <p>But you adde (<hi>pag.</hi> 102.) <hi>that Commiſſion was delivered to the Apoſtles and Miniſters of the Goſpel, as whoſe place only it was by the Keyes to open and ſhut the doors of the Church, and ſo to admit, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe, as they found men fitted or qualified, to be made members;</hi> and this you labour to prove by the practice of <hi>John Baptiſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, as for <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> (about whoſe gathering you have ſo beſtirred your ſelfbefore, and to as little purpoſe) you may obſerve, that thoſe believers in Chriſt then to come, according to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts Doctrine, were not formed into a Chriſtian Church, or Churches, as after Chriſts reſurrection the believers were. And when you come to viſit thoſe Chriſtian Churches once conſtituted in their Goſpel-form by the Apoſtles, you ſhall finde, that the power of admitting or rejecting, or caſting out of members, was not in the Apoſtles or Miniſters alone, but in the Churches. For<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 2.</note>

this, read 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. where the whole Church of the Saints in <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi> to whom <hi>Paul</hi> wrote, were to caſt out the inceſtuous perſon; as alſo afterward upon his repentance, to re-admit him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 6, 7.

It is one thing to preach, and inſtrumentally to convert ſouls, which chiefly pertains to thoſe that are called thereunto: but in the caſe of Church-government, of admitting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or caſting out, it is otherwiſe.

            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 116. You tell us, <hi>that our gathering of Churches hath no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in Scripture, and as for Chriſts Diſciples, they were all ſent to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the loſt ſheep of the houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>they went not to gather in converted amongst converted men,</hi> &amp;c. Now wee cannot have a more pregnant and more warrantable example in all Scripture then this, which you here alledge againſt us. Chriſts Diſciples gathered Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Churches out of the Church of the <hi>Jews;</hi> nor can you deny, but the <hi>Jews</hi> were a Church, when the Diſciples gathered churches out of it. Thoſe Churches in <hi>Judea (Gal.</hi> 1. 22.) were gathered out of the Church of the <hi>Jewes;</hi> and that Church of the <hi>Jewes</hi> generally believed that the Meſſias, or Chriſt, was to come. And if they were a Church when many being converted, were gathered out of it, then much more Churches may be gathered out of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or Kingdomes of the world, though for their generall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Chriſtianity, every ſuch Nation or Kingdome be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively called a church, though the new Teſtament knowes no ſuch church, and then not of divine conſtitution, as that of the <hi>Jews</hi> was, even when churches Chriſtian were gathered out of it. And brother, prove unto us, that ſuch as you call <hi>a Nationall Church,</hi> is a church of divine inſtitution; ſhew us an example of a <hi>Nationall Church</hi> in all the new Teſtament, otherwiſe you do but weave the Spiders web.</p>
            <p>But <hi>wee</hi> (ſay you) <hi>gather converted men from among converted men, and ſo pick out of others folds and flocks the beſt and fatteſt ſheep.</hi> This you do familiarly caſt in our diſh, and yet it is never the fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Now in this wee may juſtly demand of you, to prove, that thoſe whom you call <hi>converted men,</hi> from among whom wee gather churches, be indeed ſo converted as they ſhould be, when as yet they come not up cloſe to the rule of Reformation, Gods Word,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:113213:12"/>
as thereby to endeavour the ſetting up of Chriſt, without waiting on men, as without whom Gods Word is not a ſufficient rule, and as on whom wee muſt neceſſarily depend for the form and law of Reformation: And yet wee deny not but many ſuch may be god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, though otherwiſe they are not as yet throughly convinced of this kingly government of Chriſt, which we endeavour after; nay, let me go a little higher; for as much as this is an undeniable, yea, and prime principle in Divinity, that the Scripture is the only rule of faith, and of worſhip, and Church-government, and this rule is no Monopoly to one man, but that all and every man hath a power and priviledge to repair to this Law and Teſtimony, to do all things according to this Word: And ſeeing wee have all bound our ſelves by ſolemn Covenant to reform our ſelves, and thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our charge, according to the Word of God; yea, and every one to go before other in this Reformation: tell mee now, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, were it not a matter worth the while, for our reverend and learned Aſſembly, ſeriouſly to take it into debate, whether the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall tying up of men, to wait neceſſarily on the Synod for its finall reſolution about Church-government, be not an uſurpation upon our Chriſtian liberty, and a diminution, at leaſt of the authority and ſufficiency of Scripture, and ſo conſequently be not a trenching upon a fundamentall hereſie; as alſo an inhibition, reſtraining every man in his place, Miniſters, Maſters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from ſetting upon the work of Reformation, and ſo neceſſitating a violation of our Covenant, or a dangerous retarding of the work, bringing in a ſleepy careleſneſſe upon mens ſpirits, to inquire at Gods Oracle, and ſo preparing a way for blind obedience; I leave to the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the wiſeſt.</p>
            <p>But in the interim, to return to your <hi>Converts;</hi> Do you hold all them to be converts, from among whom churches are gathered? Do you not allow of a difference to be put? Are there not a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of both ignorant and ſcandalous, that are not fit to come to the Lords Table? See the <hi>Directory:</hi> Or do you take the greateſt number in <hi>England</hi> to be godly, and truly converted? Or are there not (trow you) many Pariſhes in <hi>England,</hi> where, perhaps but a few true converts are to be found?

You may do well herein to deal plainly with us, whether you would have ſo many inhabitants as are in every Pariſh, to be ſo many communicants. For ſo it ſeems you would have it: For (<hi>pag.</hi> 117.) you ſay, <hi>in the Churches of</hi> Corinth, Galatia, Coloſſe, <hi>were many that walked diſorderly, taught falſe doctrine and hereſies, and made Schiſmes; yet the Apoſtles did not bid the Chriſtians to ſeparate themſelves from the communion and aſſemblies of the Saints, and from the Ordinances, for theſe mens cauſes,</hi> &amp;c. But you may know, thoſe churches, though in part accidentally corrupt, yet were eſſentially, and in their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall conſtitution pure and holy churches; and ſo were never your Parochiall churches, they never had a right divine conſtitution, but meerly humane and politicall. And therefore all your argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>a diſpari,</hi> falls to ground, and beats it ſelf into a meer ſpume.</p>
            <p>But (<hi>pag.</hi> 118.) you plead, <hi>ſuch Miniſters and Churches to be true, where the truth of Chriſt is preached, received and profeſſed.</hi> If you mean the whole truth of Chriſt, it is well. But do not you know, that<note place="margin">Homily, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Sermon for <hi>Whitſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.</hi>
               </note> there are three ſpeciall viſible marks of a true viſible Church, The Goſpel purely preached, the Sacraments duly adminiſtred, and Diſcipline rightly practiſed? all which marks together, the Church of <hi>England</hi> (for ought I know) is yet to ſeek.</p>
            <p>For (to ſpeak nothing here of the materialls of a true particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar viſible Church: as viſible Saints; nor of the form of it, ſo many members united into one Church-body and fellowſhip, according to the Goſpel, which you can handly ſhew us in any of your Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiall Congregations) I will only ask you, What particular viſible Church you are a member of (you may chooſe what Pariſh you pleaſe in <hi>England</hi>): Next, I ask you, What Diſcipline you have in that your church; and whether a man complaining of you to your Congregation, or to your Miniſter, for wrongs done by you, and for your ſcandalous walking, he ſhall find ſo much Diſcipline there as to convent you before them, and juſtly charging you for walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcandalouſly, to the great offence and ſhame of the very name of Chriſtian Religion, you ſhall thereupon be brought under Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall cenſure, ſo as to have the ſcandall removed, and the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence ſatisfied?

extreame violation, not onely of brotherly charitie, but even of the Lawes of common humanitie. Doe you (out of no other ground but meere malice, as all the world muſt needs judge) hatch a Cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atrice-egge, a ſenſeleſſe, whimſie in your own braine, and then lay your dead childe by mee, and take my living childe from mee, as you have done, in framing your own falſe ſenſe, and putting it for mine, and taking my true ſenſe, and making it your owne? Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, What's become, I ſay not of your brotherhood, but of your manhood? Or did you thinke to cover your ſelfe with your owne Cobweb, that the palpable nakedneſs of your ſhiftleſs and ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs affront ſhould not be ſeene? Surely, this is enough, not onely to diſcover the hollow of your heart, but the ſhallow of your braine, and to bring in the verdict of the whole Univerſe, that you are a man, not onely whoſe heart is divided, but whoſe head is, &amp;c. ſalve it as you can. Now the Lord Jeſus Chriſt <hi>reprove</hi> you for this, and give you repentance for this your more then unnaturall dealing, that I may not ſay diabolicall, certainly not Chriſtian, even your beſt friends being Judges.</p>
               <p>And for the grollery and dotage you put upon your brother, (<hi>ibid.</hi> and <hi>pag.</hi> 45.) as abuſing the Scripture, when your ſelf moſt groſſely abuſe both it and him; aſſure your ſelf, your brother is not yet come to that dotage, but for all your vauntings on your part, and vilifying of his, he dare, through the help of Chriſt, deale with D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Baſtwick</hi> hand to hand, as neither admiring your learning, nor envying your Roman buff, wherein your chief ſtrength moſt lyeth, except in your ſcoffing, ſcurrilous, malicious bitter biting; yea, bloody language, in which faculty, as <hi>facile princeps,</hi> you do ſo tripudiate and glory.</p>

               <p>WHerein is touched the main point of difference between the two Parties, <hi>Claſſicall</hi> or <hi>Nationall,</hi> and <hi>Congregationall:</hi> Our brother, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>William Pryn,</hi> whoſe latter books (<hi>Truth tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>A freſh Diſcovery,</hi> &amp;c.)

               <p>The Church is a ſpirituall kingdome, whoſe only King is Chriſt,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:113213:19"/>
and not man; it is a ſpirituall Republique, whoſe only Law-giver is Chriſt, and not man: A ſpirituall houſe, whoſe only builder and governour is Chriſt: A ſpirituall Corporation, whoſe only head is Chriſt, and not man. No man, or power on earth, hath a kingly power over this kingdome; no earthly Law-giver may give lawes for the government of this Republique; no man can, or ought, to undertake the government of this communion of Saints; no humane Power or Law may intermeddle to preſcribe rules for the government or form of this ſpirituall Houſe, <hi>NOT CO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>N<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CELS, NOT SENATES.</hi> This is Chriſts royall Prerogative, which is uncommunicable to <hi>ANY, TO ALL THE POWERS ON EARTH.</hi> He addes my words, <hi>pag.</hi> 60, 61. <hi>Wee challenge you to ſhew us any Parliament, Councel, Synod, ever ſince the Apoſtles, that could, or can ſay thus, It ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt and us, ſo to determine controverſies of Religion, to make and impoſe Canons to bind all men,</hi> &amp;c. ſhew this to us at this time, and wee will obey. But if you cannot, as you never can, never let any man preſſe upon us that Scripture, that Synod, (<hi>Acts</hi> 15.) which hath no parallel in the whole world; and ſo is no precedent or pattern for any Councels, Synods, Parliaments.</p>
               <p>Thus our brother ſees down the words, here and there with ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitalls, as if ſo many capitall crimes. But the worſt of all is, that he ranks them under the head of his <hi>firſt Section, containing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſeditious, ſcandalous, libellous paſſages againſt the Authority and Juriſdiction of Parliaments, Synods, and temporall Magiſtrates in generall, in Eccleſiaſticall affaires, in the late writings of ſeverall Independent New-lights, and Firebrands;</hi> ſo runs the Title of the Section, under which hee marſhals thoſe my words, as if Chriſt could not be ſole King, Lord, and Law-giver over his own ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Kingdome in the ſoules and aſſemblies of his Saints, but this doctrine muſt needs be ſeditious, ſcandalous, and the writers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of libellous, againſt civill authority, yea, firebrands, and what not?

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:113213:20"/>
and who got their living by hard labour in husbandrie, how that Chriſt was a King indeed, but his Kingdome was not of this world, but heavenly: the Emperor hereupon, (as the Story ſaith) <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, ceaſed the Perſecution againſt the Church, by calling in his Imperiall De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree. I wiſh our brother would more ſeriouſly conſider, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of this famous example of an Heathen Emperour, but alſo upon what ſound reaſon it is grounded: as namely, upon ſuch a diſtinct ſpecificall difference between theſe two Kingdomes, the celeſtiall and the terreſtriall, as that in no ſort they may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, or compounded into one terrene kingdome, unleſſe you will ſet up a Papall power, an Harmophrodite-government, with <hi>Ecce duo gladii hîc,</hi> Behold here two ſwords, which the Pope<note place="margin">Bon face 8.</note> cauſed to be carryed before him in ſolemn proceſſion the two firſt dayes of his new erected Jubilee.</p>
               <p>And for my challenge alledged by him, it ſtands good ſtill, till hee can prove thoſe words, in the end of his <hi>Truth triumphing,</hi> true, where your words are, we cannot but in Chriſtian charity expect and believe, that all the Aſſembly and Parliament reſolve on, may have inſcribed on its front, <hi>IT SEEMED GOOD TO THE HOLY GHOST AND <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S.</hi> And then again,<note place="margin">Acts 15.</note> you muſt prove your reaſon good, whereupon you inferre this concluſion; namely, becauſe there be in the Parliament and Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, at leaſt ſome true <hi>Nathaniels</hi> and <hi>Stephens,</hi> filled with the Holy Ghoſt, and ſo many armies of prayers in the Spirit daily ſent up to heaven, to bring down that Spirit of truth upon them. But can a few, <hi>at leaſt ſome Nathaniels,</hi> among ſo many, carry the matters by vote, if they be many that contra-vote?

               <p>In the mean time, I ſhall conclude with the words of my brother <hi>Baſtwick,</hi> which hee delivers as the confeſſion of the faith of the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:113213:20"/>
Church of <hi>England,</hi> concerning Chriſts kingly office; and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently of his own faith. <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt is the only and ſole King, and Governour of the whole univerſe, to whom all power in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth is given,</hi> Matth. 28. <hi>but more eſpecially of his Church, who by God himſelfe was ſet King over his holy mountain,</hi> Pſal. 2. 6. <hi>And that hee is King of righteouſneſſe,</hi> Hebr. 7. <hi>The King eternall,</hi> Iſai. 9. <hi>The King of kings, and Lord of lords,</hi> Apoc. 17. <hi>and that he doth by his mighty power and wiſdome, uphold and govern all things, but with a more peculiar care, and a more ſpeciall manner preſerve and defend his Church,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 10. <hi>as that which hee hath purchaſed with his precious blood, and by his power redeemed out of the captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ſlavery of Satan; and that he is the head of his Church, which is the body, who infuſeth life into it; righteouſneſſe, peace, joy, happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and all the graces of wiſdome and knowledge of God with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty and aſſurance of his love; and that his Kingdome and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire is a ſpirituall and heavenly Kingdome, no terrene and fading Monarchy,</hi> Joh. 18. 38. Luke 1. 33. <hi>and is upheld and governed</hi> ONLY <hi>by the Scepter of his Spirit and Word, and not by the authority, vertue or wiſdome of any humane power.</hi> Thus D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Baſtwick,</hi> and that after all his bitter reproaches caſt upon his <hi>Independents,</hi> who hang all that which he calls <hi>Independency</hi> upon this ſole hinge; namely, That Chriſts <hi>Kingdome</hi> and <hi>Empire,</hi> is a <hi>ſpirituall and heavenly Kingdome,</hi> no <hi>terrene and fading Monarchy;</hi> and is <hi>upheld and governed</hi> ONLY <hi>by the Scepter of his Spirit and Word, and not by the authority, vertue or wiſdome of any humane power.</hi> Now if D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Baſtwick</hi> will hold to his words and writing, he muſt needs confeſſe, that Chriſt is no titular or Pageant Prince (as before) but reall and indeed: And therefore his Kingdome is not to be governed according to the various and variable laws and cuſtomes of earthly Kingdomes, Common-wealths, Countries; but by the <hi>Only Scepter of his Spirit and Word;</hi> Otherwiſe the ſpirituall King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and the temporall muſt be confounded together, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come one kingdome, and then muſt either the ſpirituall become terrene and tranſitory, or elſe the temporall become eternall, and ſo make up one <hi>Babylan, Roma aetern<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And for a cloſe, to ſatisfie my brother <hi>Prynnes</hi> Queſtion, <hi>What I mean by ſo much aſſerting Chriſts Kingly office, as ſole Head, Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Law-giver of his Churches,</hi> I mean, hee is the ſole immediate
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:113213:21"/>
King. And the proofs are from ſolid Scripture, the ſole rule of faith: As <hi>Iſai.</hi> 8. 20. and 29. 13. <hi>Hoſ. 5. 11. Matth. 15. 6, 7, 8, 9. Mar.</hi> 7. 7. And our brother confeſſeth theſe Scriptures but in part, by joyning thereto the laws and cuſtomes of Kingdoms and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weals, as a partiall rule, if not rather paramount to the ſacred, Canon; as <hi>Rome</hi> acknowledgeth the Scripture to be the rule of faith, but partiall, joyning thereto her own traditions; and ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

And if this ſatisfie not my brother, let him be pleaſed to reade over my <hi>Vindication</hi> once again, wherein he may cleerly ſee, how the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture all along ſets up Chriſt as the only Governour and Law-giver of his Church, excluding all humane Wiſdome and Power, from intermeddling in the regulating of his Kingdome, by mans Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian Rule.</p>
