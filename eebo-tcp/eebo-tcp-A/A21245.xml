            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>SIth that most barbarous and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thish opinion (right noble Sir) of the contrarietie of Learning and Armes, and the impossibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of their concurring in the same person to any perfection, is largely confuted by the many examples of those worthie Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians and Romans who did not only flourish in both, but did therfore far excel all others in martiall glory, because they had sacrificed vnto the Muses: I hope there is none so grosly ignorant, or so peruersly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uious, that will condemne my want of iudgement for chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing a patrone whose profession may seeme contrarie to the nature of this subiect: in which hope I am the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, because sundrie of your Lordships publike emploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, besides your priuat studies, doe amplie witnesse, that as your noble brother (the true knight of <hi>Minerua</hi>) hath to his eternal honor augmented the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of those few who in this last age of the declining and degenerating vvorld, haue honourably emulated those auncient Worthies: so your selfe treading the same path of Vertue, haue by like desert purchased to your name &amp; house, a second eternitie.
<pb facs="tcp:7218:3"/>
And as I doubt not that all indifferent persons wil forbeare vnfriendly carping, so likewise when I consider either the subiect, or the first and chiefest author thereof, I presume of your Lordships acceptance. For what more excellent mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or more worthy of a Philosophers penne can be treated of, then that which is he bond of humane society, and the perfector of our reasons vse, which while men wanted they seemed not men, because vvholy resembling beasts? Or what Philosopher can in depth of knowledge equall <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle,</hi> vvhose workes may be iustly tearmd, <hi>The Treasurie of humane wisdome?</hi> all which as they sauour of diuinenesse, so amongst them all, these his Discourses of Gouernment haue not the meanest relish thereof; especially vvhere hee handleth the changes and destructions of euery Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale, vvith their causes, and sets downe seuerall precepts for the vpholding and preseruing of each: vvhich vvhoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer doth aduisedly read, can doe no other than say of him as <hi>Cornelius Nepos</hi> in the life of <hi>Atticus</hi> dooth say of <hi>Tully, Prudentiam esse quodammodo diuinationem:</hi> for what he so many years since did vvrite, hath bene in all points exactly verefied by Examples of following times, descending euen to our present age. I vvill therefore referre the further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of his generall worth and this particular vvorke, vnto your Lordships wisedome, humbly suing that if his French attire become him better than his English fashion, wherein my penne hath for the most part suted, you vvill vouchsafe the harshnesse of the stile for the hardnesse of the matter, and deigne to shadow the disgraces of my defects by the grace of your protection: in which desire and hope I stay my pen, beseeching the Almighty to multiplie in you all earthly and heauenly blessings.</p>

            <head>¶ To the courteous Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>LVcilius</hi> (gentle Reader) was woont to wish that his Writings might escape the sight and censure both of the Learnedst, &amp; of the most vnlearned; least the one seeing too much should discouer some defects, &amp; the other vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding nothing, or very little, condemne all. But as in euery other thing wishes doe but argue want, and yeeld no warrant for the accomplishing of mens desires: so in this especially, because the fortune of Bookes publisht resembleth that of Ships at sea, the one subiect to all sorts of Readers as the other to all kinds of Weather. By the sorts of Readers I meane not only as <hi>Lucilius</hi> did, who distinguisht them by learning, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and meane knowledge; but there is yet a farther diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence no lesse to be respected: for oft where Learning discouers faults, Courtesie dooth shadow them: but far more oft where no faults are, discourtesie (I vse too gentle a tearme) doth impute them: so mightily are the most mens minds infected with the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter humour of <hi>Zoilisme,</hi> a thing not greatly to be merueild, sith that which is easiest is still most vsuall. It were folly in mee to wish with <hi>Lucilius</hi> for things impossible, and meere madnesse to hope for them. It shall suffise briefly to acquaint you with some thinges which being absolutely considered and the truth thereof vnknown, may seeme to yeeld large and iust occasion of reproofe: as first, the harshnesse of the phrase and rough conueiance of the stile, which if any doth dislike, as doubtlesse some will, I entreat them to remember (for I can hardly thinke they know not) that no translation is capable of Elegance as the originall, because the one hath full libertie of inuention, &amp; the other is by necessity
<pb facs="tcp:7218:4"/>
tied to obseruation: next I desire them to consider Aristotles ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of writing, the obscuritie, compacting and vnusuall compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of his stile, which if they weigh vprightly, they needs must graunt that though <hi>Tullies</hi> honourable <hi>Encomium</hi> which he doth generally giue it, calling it <hi>Aureum flumen oratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> be in respecte of the puritie thereof, and of the excellencie of the matter most true, yet that they cannot with any reason looke for a fluent and flourishing stile in the translation of such a subiect, either out of the originall or any other language where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into it hath ben since translated. I wish them farther to consider that manie places of the Comment (wherein are set downe whole discourses touching Astrologie, Cosmographie, and other deepe points of the mathematicall sciences, lightly touched by Aristotle) are more obscure than the text it selfe. Touching the diuersitie that may be found in the translation, it is not to be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled at, sith some part of the booke was performed by another, before I vndertooke the rest. But I hope, that though wee differ in the manner, yet that we swarue not from the truth of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, howsoeuer the Compositors mistaking hath therein somewhat wronged vs, and the oft &amp; thick enterlining of the copie, hasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly written, deceiued him; but the cheefest of those ouersights are noted in the end. As for the differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the English in some pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from the French, I answere, that when vpon any obscuritie I resorted to the Greek, and found the rendring therof in French not so significant as might be, I haue been bold to follow the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall, vnlesse it did so depend on the Comment, that I could not alter it. And touching the difference of it from the Latin, I hope none will accuse mee for not following that whereto I was not bound, and besides if they conferre the Latine with the French, and both with the Greeke, they shall (I doubt not) find that the French doth approch farre neerer to Aristotle. Lastly, touching the extraordinarie harshnesse that may in some places be found, I say thus much only, that the difficulty of the thing, wherin euen
<pb facs="tcp:7218:4"/>
learned men themselues haue sometimes faild, with the small time and leisure which I had both to doe and reuiew it may suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fise if not to excuse me, yet at least to purchase pardon. But sith my present hast allowes mee not sufficient time to touch euery particular, I will commit vnto your courtesies the further consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration both of this &amp; whatsoeuer els may be obiected, humbly entreating you to measure my labour not by it selfe, for it is worthlesse, but by my good will and earnest desire to please, which is therefore the greater, because I feare that my former toies haue displeasd, which were they againe to pen and publish, should rather sleepe in silence, than I through them be accused of time mispent.</p>

            <head>TO THE MOST CHRISTIAN King, <hi>Henrie</hi> king of Fraunce and Poleland, the third of that name.</head>
            <p>SIr, the bookes of Gouernment and Commonweale matters which I haue set foorth heretofore vnder your authoritie, doe now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to your Maiestie reviewed and amended, for the good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count you made of them, and for the pleasure you take sometimes in looking vpon them, and in causing them to be read vnto you. And soothly although your Highnesse being brought vp and exercised from your tender age in affairs of Peace and Warre, and other matters of state, can skill by experience of the chiefe things that are requisit to the gouernment of your realme, and doe ordinarily retaine men about you of your counsell, a great number of wise and skilfull personages: yet notwithstanding, the reading of Bookes that treat of Gouernment, may greatly delight you at times of recreation, when as you shall see in them many goodly and profitable aduertisements, concerning the gouernment of Princes. Many Kings and Emperours set their whole felicitie on warre, and in conquering new countries, but if they looke well hereinto, they shall find it better for a Prince to gouerne wisely, and to order their estate conueniently, than to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uade and conquer another Princes realme; considering that the chiefe cause why he is set vp of God, and why God is so gracious to him, as to put innumerable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in subiection to him, is that hee should holde them together in the knowledge and obseruation of the true Religion, rule them with good lawes, defende them by force of armes, and in all cases be so carefull of their welfare, as they may regarde him as their father and Sheapheard. It is not for him to applie himselfe alonly to the preparing of great and puissant Armies, to couer the Sea with Ships, Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and other vessels furnished for the warres, to giue battell, to make conquests, to winne Citties, to subdue new Kingdomes, and to set vp his flags and banners of Armes in the vttermost bounds of the World: but to prouide for the welfare of his Subiects, to remedie their harmes, to relieue their wrongfull oppressions, to yeeld and shew himselfe meeld and gentle in hearing the requests and complaints of the inferiour sort, modest and vpright in answering them, readie to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster iustice to euery man, as well by appointing reward for vertue, as punishment for vice, and finally so to behaue himselfe as hee may be loued, feared, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of all men. Most true it is Sir, that whereas at your comming to the Crowne, you found this your realme of Fraunce long forworne with the ciuile broils which
<pb facs="tcp:7218:5"/>
were at that instant far greater than euer they had bene afore, and sore impoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>shed by the former calamities; you could not then fully shew to your subiects the good dealing which you were desirous to shew towards them, because you were let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the wickednesse of the time. But now that the troubles are layd asleepe by the peace which you haue accorded of desire to releeue your afflicted people; all men looke for all manner of happinesse hereafter by means of your clemencie, and that God pittieng this realme, as one whereof hee hath shewed himselfe to haue a singular regard aboue all others, will by your means rid it from al former dangers, turning the miserable discord wherewith it hath bene infinitly disquieted, into sure concord; and the horrible tempest of ciuile warre, into perpetuall calmenesse of Peace. Howbeit letting that matter alone, I returne to Aristotles matters of Gouernment, whereunto I hope to ad Platos also, at leastwise if I may haue opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie to doe it, and that my health wil giue me leaue: not only translating them both out of Greeke into French, but also moreouer enlightening them with expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that the worke may be the more delightfull to your Maiestie, and the easier to be vnderstood of others which shall looke into it vnder your protection.

            <p>WHo so vouchsafeth to consider the restitution of good learning which hath happened in this age, and the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament which all Arts and Sciences haue recouered by the dilligence of diuers men of skill: shall haue cause to wonder to see, how almost the meanest scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are set again in their perfection; and the skill of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, being the worthiest, the behoofullest, and the needfullest of all others, is left alone behind: without the which, men who naturally be companiable, cannot in any wise maintaine their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying and societie together. Grammer, Poetrie, Rhethorick and Logicke, haue beene handled by infinite persons, and inlightened with innumerable expositions, annotations, corrections, and translations. The mathematicall sciences were neuer better known, neither were Astrology and Cosmogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy euer better vnderstood. What is more to be wondered at at this day tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to see the whole world discouered, whereof the most part hath continued so long vnknowne? And to see the vttermost coasts of East &amp; West, North and South, intercommune together, and men that are seperated with so many seas, and so farre distant one from another, to meet together by the meanes of sailing, made safer and easier by many new inuentions? As for naturall Philosophy and Phisicke, I may well vphold that they were neuer in greater perfection among the ancient Greekes and Arabians, then they be at this time, wherein a great number of beasts, roots, hearbs, trees<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> gums, liquors, fruits, minerals and other simples haue ben brought to light, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of men haue made many wholesome remedies that were not put in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise aforetimes. Who knoweth not the chaunge that is befallen in the Art of Chiualrie, as vvell by Sea as by Land, and that the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner both of besieging and of defending Fortresses, is farre differing from that vvhich hath beene of old time? Yet notvvithstanding the Cannons, Harquebushes, Pistolets, and other Artillerie of fireworke beeing brought to such perfection as they bee, are no impediment,
<pb facs="tcp:7218:7"/>
but that there bee as braue Souldiours and valiant captaines as euer there vvere. Building, painting, and musicke are set againe vvelneere in their first state: and men haue taken so great paines in eloquence of pleading, and knowledge of Law, that it is not possible to attaine to more. But as for go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, vvhich deserued to bee more laboured in than they all, as vvhich comprehendeth and ruleth them all, it hath beene let alone, vvithout recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing any light of learning vnto this day. The cause hereof in mine opinion is, that the men of skill vvhich could haue beautified it vvith their vvritings, haue vtterly forborne the dealing vvith matters of State, to giue themselues vvholly to the searching out of the truth, setting their soueraigne felicity in contemplation: and that those vvhich haue ben called to publicke charge and offices, haue commonly had no great skill, or if they haue had any, they haue vvanted leisure to vvrite. Insomuch, that by the forbearing of the learned to practise, and by the forbearing of the practisers to studie, this science (vvhich is vnperfect vvithout skill and experience ioined together) hath come behind hand as I said afore.</p>
            <p>As for my selfe, although I be not of anie excellent skill, nor of anie great experience: yet notwithstanding, foras<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uch as I haue spent my vvhole life in studie to the least disauantage that I possiblie could, and long time fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented the courts of great Princes, abiding ordinarily about such persons as haue had the charge and managing of matters of State, to the intent, to match my meane knowledge of learning with some experience of practise: I haue applied my mind chiefly to this science, attempting to further it to the vttermost of my power. Therfore hauing determined to treat thereof, I thought it not to be from the matter, to shew first of all the dignitie, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite, and antiquity thereof. Secondly, I vvill speake of the Law-makers that haue put it in practise, and finally, of the Authors that haue vvritten therof; specially of <hi>Plato</hi> &amp; <hi>Aristotle,</hi> repeating breefly the substance of their Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weales, the vvhich I vvill compare togither, to shew the fruit that may be reaped by matching the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> together. The vvhich matters being high, weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, very profitable, &amp; hitherto not treated of in French, I vvil lay forth as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily, briefly, &amp; fitly as I possibly can: praying the readers of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues attentiuely to the vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of so goodly &amp; profitable a matter.</p>
            <p>First of all therfore to come to the vvorthinesse &amp; profitablenesse of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, it is the science vvhich teacheth how to gouern mankind aright, according to the nature of ech country and people, &amp; according to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersity of the times: how states are to be founded, maintained and reformed when need requireth: how Common-weales, Kingdomes &amp; Empires are to be ordered to the benefit of the subiects, and to the honor of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates. It is the science vvhich hath the vnderstanding of all affaires, dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting all men what to do or leaue vndone, vvhich ouerlooketh all estates, beholding the meanes of their changes, ruines and preseruations: vvhich maintaineth all other arts and trades, as well the Liberall Sciences as han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicrafts, setting downe vvhether they bee to bee receiued or no; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
<pb facs="tcp:7218:7"/>
euen the most honourable of them, as the professions of chiual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, of Oratorie, of Iustice, and of housekeeping; and in at one end (which is the soueraine vvelfare of man) comprehending the ends of all the others. That is it vvhich hath first shewed vnto vs the forme of Law both naturall and ciuill, humane and diuine, priuate and publicke, vvritten and vnwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; vvhich hath inuited vs to liue friendly togither for the remedy of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vvants: vvhich hath taught vs both the beginning and the end of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane societie, and that there vvas an vniuersall and euerlasting Law printed in mens hearts, and sowen in their brests long time afore there was any or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances vvritten, or any citie founded; upon the vvhich Lawe all other particular, locall, and temporall Lawes ought to be grounded, and by the same also ruled, moderated &amp; expounded. It hath deriued equitie from na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to the intent to applie it to all cases that happen from day to day, and hath made vs truly to vnderstand, that Law &amp; Iustice consist not in opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but are naturally graffed in humane creatures. By this Science vve know the dutie of Princes towards their Subiects, of Magistrates tovvards their Princes, and also tovvards priuate persons: What Offices are most necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and most honourable: what obedience honor and reuerence the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours owe to their superiors: how men ought to behaue themselues in buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in selling, in exchanging, in prizing, in giuing, in receiuing, in promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, in bargaining, and in pleading. In great disorder should vvee be, if it had not knit vs together by marriages, kinreds, alliances, and households, deuided inheritances, stablished successions, and ordained seates of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice. For otherwise vve could not haue knowne our own from other mens, or kinsman from a stranger, or the seruant from the maister. To bee short, vvithout this science it were not possible to liue either publickly or priuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, nor in anie vvise to deale vvel vvith men or mens matters. For by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring and rewarding of vertue, by the discommending and punishing of vice, and by the reducing of all our doings to an vprightnesse, it hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured vs a meane to liue happily in quietnesse and concord vvith conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. And it is the more perfect, in that it procureth the vvelfare, not of some particular persons or companies onely, as other trades doe, but also vniuersally of all mankind, and of the vvhole vvorld, vvhich according to the opinion of the Stoikes, is the true Citie, and as you vvould say, the Common-weale of all men liuing.</p>
            <p>Thus haue you heard the excellencie and profitablenesse of Gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: consider ye now the antiquitie thereof, and by the same meanes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider also the law-giuers, vvhich did first put it in practise, and afterward the Authors that haue vvritten thereof. <hi>Aristotle</hi> (who thought the vvorld to be eternall) doth in the seuenth booke of his Common-weale, deeme this sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to haue ben inuented long ago, and also manie or rather infinit times since to haue beene forgone and lost. <hi>Plato</hi> in his third and sixth bookes of lawes, affirmeth that it began vvhen townes and ordinances of townes first
<pb facs="tcp:7218:8"/>
began, at such time as men vvere multiplied vpon the earth. And he suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, that in vnaccountable and almost infinite length of time, innumerable cities haue been builded and also destroied, and become one while of smal, great; and another while of great, small; one while euil of good, and another while good of euill: vvhich chaunge hath befallen not onely in Cities and Townes, but also in Nations and Countries, yea and euen in mighty king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and Empires, founded at the beginning with great prowesse of the first lords of them, &amp; afterward marred by the lazinesse of their successors, or else diminished by little and little through the long continuance of time vvhich maketh an end of all thinges. <hi>Plato</hi> in his <hi>Timeus</hi> and in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale, <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his <hi>Meteores,</hi> and <hi>Seneca</hi> in his Naturall Questions, thinke it to haue come to passe through the fatall Law of the World, as wel by the mouing of the first Heauen, vvhereupon all other mouings and the vvhole course of nature dependeth, as by the meetings and goings asunder of the plannets, to vvhom the Elements and all things compounded of the elements, are obedient. And peremptorily they father the destructions vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them: imputing the most generall sort of them vnto excessiue vvater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>floods and burnings by fire, and the lesser sort to vvarres, plagues, famines, and earthquakes, of purpose to clense countries from vvicked inhabitants, vvhen the naughtinesse of them is growne vp to the highest pitch. After vvhich riddances, the men that come vp next, vvere verie simple and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. Then some one or two being found among them to be of greater vvit then the rest, did purchase great reputation by teaching the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> good behauior vvith some shew of Religion, as <hi>Mercury</hi> and <hi>Sesostris</hi> did in old time in AE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gipt, <hi>Saturne</hi> in Italy, &amp; <hi>Orpheus</hi> and <hi>Amphion</hi> in Greece. On the other side, need taught them by little and little thinges necessarie, after the vvhich fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the things that serue for honor and pompe, vntill at length, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer superfluitie succeeded againe. Those excellent personages staied vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the hauing of such interchangeable intercourse of Arts, states, and other inferior things: With vvhom the most renovvmed Astrologers agree; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that they vvill needs determine not onely the liues and fortunes of men, but also the prosperities and aduersities of cities and Nations, as <hi>Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie</hi> hath done in his Quadripartite according to the ancient Chaldees and AEgyptians, and after him the Arabians and also some Christians: adding thereunto the continuance of sects, as did <hi>Peter Ally</hi> a diuine of Paris and Cardinall of Cambray, in his concordance of Diuinitie and Astrologie: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst vvhom did set themselues <hi>Iohn</hi> Earle of Mirandula in his fift booke against Astrologers, and <hi>Viues</hi> in his second booke of Christian truth. But to returne againe to our matter. If vve looke throughly into all antiquity, vvhereof anie remembrance remaineth vnto vs, vvee shall finde, that the people vvhich inhabited in old time the Countrie vvhere vvee dwell now, vvere as rude and vnciuill three thousand yeares agoe, as are Sauages that haue lately beene discouered by the Spaniards and Portingales
<pb facs="tcp:7218:8"/>
towards the West and South parts of the vvorld. They dwelt scattered here and there in caues of mountaines, and in Forrests vnder Cabines, vvithout law, vvithout Iustice, vvithout Counsell, vvithout Magistrate, vvithout Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and vvithout any forme of marriage. Afterward being increased by little and little, they communicated one vvith another, and began to draw into companies, vvherevpon insued Hamlets, Villages, Townes, and finally Cities; the good men being not onely induced to such meeting for friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships sake, but also inforced by the necessities and aduersities that pinched them, vvhich draue them to helpe one another. At the beginning they liued together in a certaine naturall simplicity, as yet vncorrupted by ambition or couetousnesse, and vnmarred of false opinions. Euery companie obeied the eldest among them, vsing his vvill for their Law, and demeaning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues simplie according to vse and custome. Afterward, as leaudnesse did increase, it stood them on hand to make lawes, and for the obeying of them to create Magistrates vvith authoritie, that they might represse the ouer-lustinesse and malapartnesse of the vvicked. For although man be natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ciuill, and more companiable than any other mortall vvight, and to that purpose is indued with reason and speech, that he might communicate with others: yet notwithstanding forasmuch as he is subiect to passions vvhich oftentimes doe trouble him, and to leaud lusts vvhich incessantly restraine him from the good, it vvas needfull to set him downe some commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, vvhereby to bridle such affections, and to set them again in the right vvay of Iustice. Whereunto some excellent personages hauing the skill of gouernement haue strained themselues to prouide a remedie by appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting trades of liuing and lawes to folke in diuers countries at diuers times; and for that cause they vvere called Law-makers. And these haue alwaies furthered that inuention of theirs vpon God, the first cause and originall fountaine of all goodnesse: as vvho vvould say, it is not possible to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine ignorant &amp; froward folke, vvithout Religion and the feare of God, vvhich is the foundation, stablishment, and maintenance of all Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vveales. The famousest Law-giuer that vve knovv of, vvas <hi>Moyses</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet of God, vvho by Gods commandement gaue the Lavv to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brues at their departure out of AEgypt. There haue beene other Lavv-giuers in other places, vvho likewise haue fathered their Lawes vpon God vnder diuers names, according to the diuers opinions of the Countries vvhere they vvere: As for example, <hi>Zoroastres</hi> the Lavv-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of the Bactrians and Persians, fathered his Lavves vpon <hi>Oromases: Trismegist</hi> the Lavv-giuer of the AEgyptians vpon <hi>Mercurie: Zamolxis</hi> the Lavv-giuer of the Scythians vpon <hi>Vesi: Charondas</hi> the Chalcidian vpon <hi>Saturne: Minos</hi> the Candian vpon <hi>Iupiter: Lycurgus</hi> the Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonian vpon <hi>Apollo: Draco</hi> and <hi>Solon</hi> the Lavv-giuers of Athens vpon <hi>Minerua:</hi> And <hi>Numa</hi> the Lavv-giuer of the Romanes vpon <hi>Ege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi>: all of them mingling their temporall gouernement vvith Religion,
<pb facs="tcp:7218:9"/>
which in old time was accounted the onely wisedome; and none other were taken for wise, but such as deliuered foorth Religion, and interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it vnto men. A good while after the decease of <hi>Numa,</hi> because his lawes and the Lawes of other men, as well afore him as after him, were found vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect; ten men vvere appointed in Rome with absolute authoritie for the time, to ouerlooke them and amend them, and to adde vnto them such other Lawes as they knewe to bee needfull for the gouernement of their State. And to that end they sent to Athens, Lacedemon, and other places, where they heard there was any good State of good gouernment: From vvhich places they tooke manie constitutions vvhich they mingled with their owne, and brought them all into twelue Tables, vvherein they comprised the whole bodie of the Romane Lawe, and the vvhole order of ciuill gouernment. <hi>Cicero</hi> in his first Booke of his Orator, affirmeth that they farre passed all the bookes of the Philosophers both in authority and profite. And <hi>Titus Liuius</hi> in his third Booke of the first <hi>Decade,</hi> complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the excessiue multitude of the Lawes that were in Rome in his time, vvriteth that the Fountaine of all Iustice both publicke and priuate, vvas contained in the twelue Tables.</p>
            <p>After the making, publishing, and receiuing of those Lawes, there came vp Lawiers, who vnderstanding the lawes and customes that were vsed par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulerly in the citie, and the formes of pleading, gaue counsell in euery se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall matter, and shewed men how they should bring their actions, as well in criminall cases, as in matters of trespasse. They shewed the order of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencing their actions, of taking exceptions, of seeking delaies, of giuing vvarnings, and taking defaults, of making inquisitions and informations, of pronouncing sentences, of putting in and drawing backe of Appeales, and of giuing definitiue iudgement: vvherethrough their authoritie grew so great, specially at Roome, that no Testament or last Will, no Stipulation or Suretiship, no Obligation or bond, no couenant, no composition, no bargaine, no contract of Marriage, nor any other matter of importance passed vvithout their priuitie. And men resorted vnto them, not onely in cases concerning the ciuill Law, but also for all their other affaires and dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings. They vvere of counsell vvith the Emperours, vvith the Senatours, vvith the assemblies of the people, and vvith the cases of their freindes: They vvere called to counsell both in peace and vvarre. By reason vvhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, they vvere called men of skill, and their profession vvas called the skill of Law; because that that profession could not be demeaned vvithout ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie great skill and discretion; nor vvithout much seeing, hearing, reading, and vnderstanding, nor vvithout the knovving of things done in old time, nor vvithout the knowledge of the common disposition of mankind, and the nature of right and equitie, nor vvithout marking the manners and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes of diuers Nations, specially of their ovvne. These Lavvyers had their cheefe scope and svvay in Italie, and vvrote infinite Bookes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb facs="tcp:7218:9"/>
that matter; as <hi>Seuerus, Sulpicius, Scaeuola, Papinian, Vlpian, Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> and others. Their verie Office vvas to expound the true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Pretorian proclamation, of the constitution of the Senate, of the decrees of the people, of the ordinances of Princes, and of all other Lawes: to shew the reason of euery of them, to informe men which of them vvere to bee kept, or renued, or abrogated, according to place, time, person, and other circumstances, after the same maner that the Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothets did in Athens. The Historiographers wrote the warres, and regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred the other publicke doings, as <hi>Herodotus, Thucidides, Polybius, Salust, Titus Liuius, Tacitus,</hi> and innumerable others did in all Languages. Some Orators gouerned States, and were assistants in consultaions of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke affaires, whereof they wrote Orations, as did <hi>Demosthenes</hi> and <hi>Cicero.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Other some being more giuen to contemplation, applied not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues so much to dealing vvith the people and vvith the Citie matters, as the former sort did, who commonly meddled in all things: But foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as they were indued with great wit, and had attained to great skill, by meane of the great rest and leisure which they had, they sought out the truth of all things concerning God and man. And as touching Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weales, they conferred them one with another, and by so doing, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuored to yeeld causes and reasons of their continuances and decaies, and to shewe by what meanes euery of them was stablished, why some were better gouerned and some worse; which was the best Common-weale, who was the perfect Common-wealeman, and who is the true Prince and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate. Such vvere <hi>Plato, Aristotle, Heraclides</hi> of Pont, <hi>Theophrastus, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caerchus,</hi> and <hi>Plutarke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first professors of Philosophie, vvondering at the heauens and the Starres, and at their reuolutions and effects; and beholding the earth, the vvaters fresh and salt, the aire variable, the burning fire, and all thinges as vvell simple as compounded contained within the compasse of the vvhole vvorld, in multitude innumerable, and in beautie vvonderfull: bent their vvits to the finding out of their properties, agreeings, and disagreeings, to know vvhereof they vvere made or engendred, how long they continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, vvhere they became, vvhen and how they perished, and vvhat in them vvas mortall and corruptible, and vvhat diuine and euerlasting. They marked the moouings of the Starres, their meetings, their oppositions, their distances, their appearings, their hidings of themselues, their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, their swiftnesse, their flovvnesse, their colours, and the maruellous accidents both generall and particular vvhich they cause, according to the ansvvereablenesse of the parts of Heauen and Earth one to another, the disposition of the matter vvhich they meet vvithall, and the diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities of the seasons vvherein they reigne and vvorke.

Neuerthelesse, forasmuch as they thought it odious both to God and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to blaze abroad those things differently to all men, for feare least the making of them too common, might cause them to bee despised of the rascall sort, some of them did darken them expressely, with numbers and figures of Geometrie: and other some wrapped them vp in couerts of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and set them downe in measured verses, to the intent, to make their workes the more durable through the delightfulnesse of the fables and the sweetnesse of the verse. <hi>Plato</hi> changet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But as touching naturall Philosophy and Astrologie, <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> maketh very small reckoning of them, but giueth himselfe chiefly to reasoning of manners, of vertue, of vice, and altogether of good and euill. He was the first of all the Greek Philosophers, that drew Philosophy from gazing vpon the Heauens and vpon Nature, to applie it to the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Housesholds and Common-weales, as <hi>Xenophon</hi> reporteth, who in the first Booke of his Commentaries, writeth thus of him.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Socrates</hi> (saieth hee) spake not of the matter or stuffe of all thinges, ass manie Philosophers doe, neither occupied he his wits in considering how the world was created, and by what necessitie the Heauenly thinges are made: but shewed, that such as gaue themselues to such kind of gazing or contemplation, were fooles. First hee demanded of them whether they thought themselues so sufficiently skilfull in humane thinges alreadie, as to proceed from them to the speculation of the other: if not, then whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they thought themselues to doe well, in leauing humane matters to gaze vpon the heauens. He vvondered that they perceiued it not to bee vnpossible for them to attaine to the knowledge of those things, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering how those vvhich seeme most skilfull in them, agree not among themselues, but behaue themselues like mad men one towards another. For as of fooles, some feare not the thinges that are to bee feared, and some are afraid vvhere no cause is, some are not ashamed to doe and say openly vvhatsoeuer commeth in their head, and other some dare not disclose themselues in companie, some yeeld no reuerence at all neither to Temple nor to Altar, nor to any deuine thing, and other some vvorship both blockes and stones and brute beastes: so among them which busie themselues about the searching out of the nature of all things, some think there is but onely one Beeing or Beeer, and some thinke there are
<pb facs="tcp:7218:10"/>
infinite multitudes of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vvithout number. Some thinke that all things are moued, &amp; some that nothing is moued: some that all things are created and doe perish, and other some that nothing vvas created, nor anie thing dooth perish. He demanded of them yet further after this manner; namely, vvhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that as they that haue the knowledge of thinges belonging to men, can skill to doe them themselues, and to teach them vnto others; so vvhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the searchers of the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly things do think, that by their knowing by vvhat necessitie ech thing is ordained, can vvhen they list make the vvind to blow, and the shoures to raine, or alter the seasonablenesse of the yeare vvhen need is: or vvhether they had no such hope, but rested vvithin their only bare knowledge how euery thing vvas made. After that manner spake he to such as did set their minds vpon such curiosities. Vnto other men hee disputed ordinarily of things pertaining to man, discussing vvhat vvas god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, and vvhat vvas vngodlinesse; vvhat vvas honest, and vvhat vnhonest; vvhat vvas right and vvhat vvrong; vvhat vvisdome, and vvhat folly; vvhat manlinesse, and vvhat covvardlinesse; vvhat vvas a Common-vveale, and vvho is a Common-weale man; vvhat it is to raigne, and vvhat manner of one he ought to be that should command. Manie other things also did he discourse, vvherof the knowledge might (in his iudgement) make me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> good and honest: esteeming them vvorthie the name of slaues, vvhich vvere ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of them. And in the fourth booke of the same his Commentaries, <hi>Xenophon</hi> saith of him againe: He deemed those men to haue a good vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, vvhich soone conceiued of the thing vvhich they studied, &amp; bare vvell avvay the things vvhich they learned, and vvere desirous of those Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences vvhich teach vs hovv to liue vvel in a house and in a Common-weale, and generally to vse all men and all things as becommeth vs. For he vvas of opinion, that if those persons were well instructed, they would not only be happie men in their priuate behauior, and in the vvel ordering of their own houses, but also make the vvhole cities and Common-weales happy where they dwell.</q>
Notwithstanding, <hi>Aulus Gellius</hi> witnesseth, that euen vnto his daies the men of Athens had opinion, that <hi>Xenophon</hi> (of hatred to <hi>Plato</hi>) wrote the aforesaid vvords purposely against <hi>Plato,</hi> because that in his books he brought in <hi>Socrates,</hi> discoursing of Naturall Philosophy, Geometry, and Musick. But in very deed <hi>Plato</hi> himselfe maketh him to speak well nigh the like things in his <hi>Phedon.</hi>
               <q>When I vvas yoong (saith <hi>Socrates</hi>) I had a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellous desire to learne the Science vvhich is called the Historie of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: For I thought it to be a verie excellent thing to vnderstand the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses vvhy all things are done, wherfore they perish, and by vvhat means they be maintained. Oftentimes tossed I my selfe vp and downe in considering such doings from the beginning: as for example, to knovv vvhether that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter heat &amp; cold haue receiued some putrifaction, thereupon (as some haue said) liuing creatures are ingendred and sustained. And againe, vvhether the cause of wisedome in vs bee blood, or aire, or fire, or none of them all:
<pb facs="tcp:7218:11"/>
but rather that our hearing, seeing, and smelling do come of the braine: of the vvhich sences spring memorie and opinion, and likewise of memorie and opinion taking their rest, do spring vp skill by the same means. Againe in considering the corrupting of those things, and the inconueniences that happen in the skies and earth, I vvas vtterly grauelled in the end, because I vvas faine still to vnlearne the same things, vvhich I thought I had learned afore. Also <hi>Plutarke</hi> vvriteth of him in <hi>Solons</hi> life, that hee loued chieflie that part of morall Philosophy vvhich treateth of the gouernment of Common-weales, as the most part of the vvise men of that time did, vvho sought to haue no further insight than of the thinges that are in common vse among men, vvherethrough they purchased the renowme of vvisedome, by being vvell seene alonely in matters of state and gouernement.</q>
            </p>
            <p>As for <hi>Socrates,</hi> although he vvas of excellent skil, vvisdome, and sharpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of vvit, and verie eloquent, yet did he not vvrite any thing. But <hi>Plato, Xenophon,</hi> and other of his Disciples conueied into their bookes the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses vvhich hee had made at diuers times, or rather for the reuerence vvhich they bare vnto him, they published the most part of their owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions vnder his name, to giue the more authoritie vnto them. The Greekes affirme <hi>Plato</hi> to haue been the first among them that vvrote anie bookes of Common-vveale matters. He imagining that vve cannot knovv anie thing ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

According to this opinion, he did cast in his imagination a certain <hi>Idaea</hi> of a perfect Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvealth, and rather diuine then humane: for that perceiuing mankind to be alvvaies trauelled and troubled vvith dissention, that those vvhom in times past by innumerable lavves and ordinances inuented to remedy &amp; redresse the same, had nothing profited therein, but to the contrary, all things rather seemed to impaire: hee esteemed that to plucke vp and extirpe the hatreds and partialities of men, there could be nothing more expedient then to set before their eies a community, not only of all good things, but also of things namely vvhich Nature it selfe hath made and framed proper to euery man, as of eies, eares, and hands, to the end, that vvhosoeuer should see, heare, or doe any thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:7218:11"/>
ought likewise to be common, therby to breed and intertaine loue among the cittizens: who by that means hauing nothing in perticular, should ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by bee touched with one like ioy and greefe, according to the occurrence, and effect of their affaires. Not that in any sort he esteemeth it an easie thing to be done (as hee himselfe affirmeth in the beginning of his first booke of the Common-wealth, as also about the end of the ninth) but rather for the nouelty therof, that it should be found a thing most strange &amp; admirable, as not being vsed or once allowed of in any place whatsoeuer, but that the example and forme of polliticke perfection, wherevpon in argument and word he had framed this Common-wealth, peraduenture being in heauen, and visible onely to those that would attentiuelie behold the same with the eies of good intelligence, to the end, that hauing seene and beheld it, they should by imitation assay all meanes to conforme themselues vnto it. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting therefore this forme of a Common-wealth, framed and deuised according to the patron by him conceiued vvithin his high and diuine spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, hee was much more pleased and satisfied therewith then in all his other works, as it well appeareth by the beginning of <hi>Timee,</hi> wherein hauing col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected the principal points of all his politick discourse, he sheweth his great and singular affection vnto the worke, withall wishing to find some excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Ora<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

For that therein there is such grauity of senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, eloquence of words, and varietie of exquisite proposition, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to finde a thing more artificially wrought. Now hauing purposed to represent vnto vs the image of a most perfect, true, and iust Common-wealth, hee hath intituled his vvorke by the name of Pollicie or Iustice, principally inforcing himselfe to shew that it is Iustice, because hee estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it to be the true and only rule of Politicke institution, wherevnto all humane actions ought wholly to be referred. The Heauens by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall moouing, running and compassing about this earthly mould, stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vp &amp; quickeneth the seeds of all things whatsoeuer that are inclosed &amp; cast into the superficiall part thereof, which being and remaining within the earth, are nourished by the water, brought forth and sprung vp by the force of aire and fire, and then to make them ripe, are quickened by the naturall influences of the celestial plannets, specially the sunne and moone: who by their admirable and strange vertues doe still disperse &amp; cast forth in euerie place a perpetuall and continuall desire of naturall production, thereby at all times and seasons to fill and to replenish the world with new creatures, plants, hearbes, trees, stones, and mettals, and to continue them in their kinds for the vse of man, for who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> only all things on earth are made and created. Who notwithstanding their reasonable and polliticke produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, cannot receiue or reape anie fruit thereof without Iustice, Law, and Magistrates, who by good reason are rightly tearmed the Ministers of God, ordained and appointed for the gouernement and conseruation of mankind, in due and reasonable proportion to distribute and deuide
<pb facs="tcp:7218:12"/>
among them those goods and things vvhich daily by the most diuine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence of God are giuen and sent vnto them: seeing then that Iustice is of such force and efficary, there can be no better nor more necessary vvorke done nor procured vnto man, then by all meanes to mooue and stirre him vp vnto the same, vvithout the vvhich, they neither can nor may liue either solitarie or in companie vvhatsoeuer. Therefore doth <hi>Plato</hi> deserue great praise among all such as haue either stablished Common-weales or vvritten of the forme of Gouernement; specially, for that hee groundeth not the principles of his Common-weale vpon richesse, power of men, or conquests, as most men doe; but vpon Iustice, the vvhich hee preferreth before all thinges: in consideration, that in vvhatsoeuer coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries and States of Gouernement it is duly knowne, and sincerely obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, vvith true Religion and the pure seruing of God, it maketh all trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, sutes in Law, and dissentions to cease, and procureth great happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to the persons that follow it. <hi>Socrates</hi> disputing vvith <hi>Thrasyma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus, Glaucus,</hi> and <hi>Adimant,</hi> dooth in his first Booke and in a part of his second, examine certaine definitions of Iustice, and compare it vvith vniustice by laying them together, to the intent, that beeing the better knowne, the one may bee the more reuenced, and the other the more misliked and hated. The vvhich manner of teaching by contra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>s, is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued in manie Sciences, and is of vvonderfull force. As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Phisicke speaketh not onely of health, but also of Sicknesse: and Musicke speaketh not onely of Concords, but also of Discords: to the intent, to doe the contraries the better: namely, to maintaine health, and to keepe good tune. Likewise, Morrall Philosopie giueth vs knovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, not onely of the thinges that are delightfull and profitable in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie deed, but also of the thinges that are vnhonest, vnpleasant, and hurtfull.

            <p>Therefore <hi>Socrates</hi> treating of the Iustice that is to bee in a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vveale, and in man, seeketh it first in the Common-weale vvhere it is most apparant, as in the greater thing, and aftervvard in man, vvhere it is lesse apparant, as in the lesser thing. And vpon that occasion, hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth the Originall of Common-weales, Kinreds. Degrees, States, Trades, and exercises of people, in vvhat sort they may mainetaine Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice amoug them, and vvherein consisteth the commoditie of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale, by comparing a vvell ordered Common-weale with a corrupt one. And because the gouernment of all Common-weales dependeth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the bringing vp of the commoners: throughout his whole third Booke, and in a good part of his fourth, he traineth them vp from their verie infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, according to their natural inclinations &amp; dispositions: but specially the keepers, that is to say, the Magistrats and men of war, whom aboue all men
<pb facs="tcp:7218:12"/>
he vvill haue to be vvell instructed in true religion, vvithout corruption of poeticall fables. Then returneth he againe to his discourse of Iustice, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming it to be the vnion of the foure principall vertues, wisdome, stoutnes, temperance, and particular Iustice.</p>
            <p>And that the Common-weale is iust or rightfull, vvhere euerie vertue doth his proper dutie, as well towardes the commanders as towardes the obeyers, of vvhat sort or qualitie soeuer they be: and likewise that the man is iust vvhere the like consent of the foresaid vertues is found, because there is the selfesame behauiour required in euery seuerall person, which is to be required in a whole Common-weale. That in the soule of man there are three parts, Reason, Wrath, and Lust: that Wisdome serueth to guide Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, Stoutnesse to restraine Wrath, and Temperance to bridle Lust. That in a Commonweale the Gouernours doe represent the image of Reason and Wisdome: the defenders resemble Wrath and Stoutnes, and the han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicrafts and merchants are like to Lust and Temperance. And therefore the Commonweale or the Man is then iust, when in the Common-weale the vertues, and in the Man the partes of the Soule, doe their duties due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without incroching one vpon another: and that the Common-weale and the Man are vniust where the contrarie befalleth, forasmuch as vniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice is nothing else but the transgressing of the said duties and offices: like as the sicknesse of the bodie is the disorder and disagreement of the foure humours, and the health of the bodie is their good agreement in due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion togither.</p>
            <p>In the fift booke hee treateth of the communitie of goods, wiues, and children. Hauing set his Common-weale in that order, in his sixt booke he describeth the office of the Princes which are to rule it. The which he continueth on withall in the seuenth booke, rehearsing particularly what sciences they ought to learne, &amp; in what order. And forasmuch as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered that there be many sortes of Common-weales differing from his, he compareth them with it, in the eight and ninth bookes, declaring verie cunningly the changes of the one sort vnto the other, and therewithall also their vices and discommodities. Finally, because most men are so bent to their owne profit, that they forget all dutie and conscience, to the intent to induce <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll men to doe vvell, in his tenth and last booke he declareth that rewards are appointed for the righteous, and punishments for the vnrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, not onely in this present life, but also in the life to come. At the first hee did put forth no moe but the first two books, against the whichh Xenophon (beating him a little grudge) did set himselfe, and vvrote the Institution or bringing vp of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> vvherein hee expressed the image of a rightfull kingdome and a martiall King, of purpose to set foorth the kingly gouernment, differing from that which <hi>Plato</hi> did set downe in his Common-weale. Whereat <hi>Plato</hi> vvas so sore offended, that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward taking occasion in his third booke to treate of the kingdome of the Persians, and comming of purpose to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> to the intent to picke a
<pb facs="tcp:7218:13"/>
quarrell to <hi>Xenophons</hi> vvorke, he acknowledged <hi>Cyrus</hi> to be a hardie and valiant Prince, howbeit that he neuer had any honorable bringing vp. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that <hi>Plato</hi> had finished his Common-weale, he made also twelue books of Lawes, vvherein he speaketh himselfe vnder the name of his host of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens. And in pretending to giue lawes to the Greekes, he examineth three Common-weales, vvhich flourished at that time in Greece: namely, the Candian, the Lacedemonian, and the Athenian; abating, adding, and alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring many points in them, to make one better of them all. Moreouer, to the same purpose, he vvrote two other Treatises, the one intituled <hi>Minos,</hi> vvherein he defineth and deuideth Lavv; and the other Gouernement, as vvherein consisteth the skill of gouerning, and hovv the same ought to be vsed. <hi>Cicero</hi> affirming himselfe to be a follovver of <hi>Plato,</hi> and glorying of himselfe for his matching of eloquence vvith Philosophy, made sixe books of Common-vveale in dialogue vvise in the Romane tongue, applied chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly to the Romane State, vvhich bookes are lost by the iniury of time: and as manie of Lawes, conformable to the twelue Tables, of vvhich there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine but only three, and those vnperfect and corrupted.</p>
            <p>Novv then, vvhereas the first Sages gaue themselues vvholly to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of the heauens, and of nature; and <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> bent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues chiefly to Morall Philosophie, <hi>Aristotle</hi> succeeding them, comprised all the parts of Philosophie most happily. I vvil not at this present meddle vvith anie other of his vvritings, but reserue my treating of them to some more conuenient time. I vvil speake but only of those vvhich serue my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent turne. First of all he gathereth the institutions of two hundred and fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Common-vveales, as vvell Straungers as Greekes. Then vvriteth he to <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, concerning Raigning: Afterward hee made eight bookes of gouernement full of great Learning and Wisedome, in the vvhich he hath brought all the skill of gouerning into forme of Art. In his first Booke hee sheweth from vvhence Ciuill societie proceedeth, vvherein it consisteth, and to vvhat end it is to bee referred; beginning at the first and singlest parts thereof. Next hee treateth of the meanes vvhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to get goods, vvhich serue to mainetaine both housholds and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-vveales, and fetcheth the true causes of gouernements from Nature. In the second place, afore hee enter into the principall matter, hee exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the most Renovvmed Common-vveales of his time, and bevvraieth the vvants of them all. Then comming to the third point, vvhich is the right beginning of his Gouernement, he shevveth vvhat a Citie is, vvho is a Citizen, and vvhat a Common-vveale is, hovv manie sorts of Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vveales there are, hovv euery of them is stablished, and hovv men be dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be gouerned by some one sort rather than by another, vvhich things he goeth through vvithall in his fourth booke. In the fifth booke are set down the alterations, decaies, and preseruations of States. In the sixt he speaketh interchangeably of the Gouernement by a fevv, and of Gouernement by the multitude; of either of their vnderkinds, resemblances, proprieties,
<pb facs="tcp:7218:13"/>
and communicatings: of the Magistrates needfull for either state, and of their charges. In the seuenth, which absolutely is the perfect Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale, and wherein consisteth the happinesse of cities: he treateth of the scituation, commoditie, and ornament of a Citie: of the condition of the territorie about it: of the number and quantities of the inhabitants, of marriage, and of procreation and bringing vp of children: the training of whome he toucheth in the eight and last booke which is vnperfect, where he discourseth particularly in what exercises and what trades they ought to be entred at the first.</p>
            <p>Now that I haue briefly rehearsed the principall matters set downe in the Common-weales of Plato and Aristotle, I am to tell you wherefore I determined to ioyne them togither, and to shew you the importance and profite of that ioyning. Certaine it is that there was neuer any man fully and wholly perfect in this world, how great grace soeuer God bestowed vpon him, but that with notable vertues, alwaies some notable vices haue been matched. Therefore no maruaile though Plato and Aristotle being excellent personages, and such as had gained the prize of knowledge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, haue now and then erred, specially in this matter of Gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Out of doubt Plato had done the better if hee had contented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe with the order, elegancie, and grauitie which hee kept in the descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Common-vveale, and not medled vvith the communitie of goods, wiues, and children, nor taken vpon him to appoint men &amp; vvo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men their seuerall charges and offices. For doing vvhereof hee is blamed, not onely by them of his ovvne time, but also by all those that haue come after him, of what religion soeuer they haue held, who vvith one consent haue reiected that fashion as too too straunge and impossible. Likevvise Aristotle had auoided many rebukes if hee had shevved himselfe more carefull of religion, whereof he seemeth to haue small regard, and not ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued mens turnes more to profit and ease than to godlinesse, whereof Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hath great care in all his bookes. For euery vvell ordered State or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monvveale hath such need of religion to be matched vvith ciuill gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that they seeme too vnseparable. Religion printeth and setteth the feare of God and the loue of their neighbours in mens heartes, ruling the exposition of the holy Scriptures, and the offices of the persons that are appointed to the seruice of God. And ciuill gouernment directeth the affaires of peace and warre, wherein there would be neither vprightnesse nor faithfulnesse, without the feare of God and the loue of man, which are chiefly enioyned in all religions.

               </gap>n more cleer-sighted and better assured of their doings. Soothly in all Artes three things are necessarie to the purchasing of perfection: namely, Nature, Learning, and Experience. Nature is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination and forwardnes; Learning quickneth vp nature, and being aided vvith order and method, guideth it by generall precepts and vniuersall grounds; and Experience assisted with imitation, confirmeth both the other by the continuall holding on of many particular actions. Any one of them alone hath verie small force: Nature of it selfe is vnsufficient, Learning vvithout nature is fondnesse, and vvithout Experience vnprofitable: like vvater that stands sodding in a marrish, or like hearbes and fruits that are alwaies ouershadowed. But when all three of them doe meet togither, then bring they forth the excellencie vvhich we so greatly commend and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at in all things. In Leachcraft although the bare practitioner doe by his experience sometimes hit well vpon the healing of some disease, yet is it euident, that hauing Art and cunning matched vvith his experience, so as he discerne the nature and cause of the disease, marking the complexion, age, and manner of liuing of his patient, and thereunto considering the qualitie and quantitie of his medicines, and applying them in due time, he shall the better performe the dutie of his science, and commonly the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther attaine to the end thereof. Also in like case, the pilot that can skill of the Art of sailing, and knoweth the diuersities of the seasons of the yeere, the nature of the Sea and of the vvinds, the alterations of the aire, and the moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings of the heauens, shall ordinarily performe his voiage better and more sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise vvhosoeuer taketh vpon him to found a new State, to restore a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caied, to preserue a long continued, to reforme a corrupted, or to gouerne a stablished, if he be a politicke fellow by nature, and moreouer vvell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed and experienced in the case, so as he haue iudgement to consider aduisedly the natures of euery of them, and to discerne their beginnings, increasings, strengths, decaies, changes, and instants of ending one in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, hee shall fare much the better by being so schooled and prepared aforehand. Nay (vvhich more is) I say that otherwise he shall see nothing at all in that behalfe for the most part of his time, but shall go groping like a blind man, and commit many vvorse errors than the ignorant phisitian and pilot, because the case vvhich he vndertaketh is of farre greater impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and concerneth moe folke, as namely the tranquilitie, welfare, and honour of a vvhole countrey or Nation, or of a State sore attainted with the

               </gap>d on from the most single to the composed, because we may then be well said to know a thing, when we know the first causes and the first principles thereof, euen to the verie bottome and ground thereof, as is written in the beginning of his Naturall Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophie. Forasmuch therefore as the dutie of him that dealeth with matters of State, is to treat of ciuill Societie and to seeke out the causes thereof, from Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; Aristotle purposing to write thereof, sheweth first of all from whence this societie proceedeth, wherein it consisteth, and to what end it is ordained: begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at the first and simplest partes thereof, that is to wit, the companie of man and wife, master and seruant, father and children: of which companies a hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold is compacted. Afterward by increasing many housholds into a street or ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, and many streets into a Citie, Corporation, or Common-weale: he sheweth the same to haue a naturall constitution, and to be the most perfect companie, and the end thereof to be of the best sort, as which comprehendeth all the other endes, and whereunto they be all referred. Then forasmuch as no companie can main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine themselues without goods, he treateth of the manner of getting them, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to the maintenance as well of houshold as of Common-weale, of which man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of getting he setteth downe diuers sorts both natural and artificiall: among the which he vtterly discommendeth interest and vsurie. Moreouer, because no companie can continue vnlesse it be held togither by some gouernment, he fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth the first causes of Gouernments from out of nature, beginning at the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernments of houshold, and affirming that the husbands commaunding of the wife, is Citie-like or Commonweale-like: the fathers commanding of his children, is Kinglike or Princelike: and the masters commaunding of his seruants and slaues is tyrant-like: disputing there at large whether there be any slauerie or bondage by nature or no. Insomuch that from these first three Gouernments of Houshold, he deriueth all sorts of publicke gouernment, as well voluntarie as vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent, resembling their first originall to man, who is composed of bodie, soule, and mind: the soule hauing masterlike authoritie ouer the bodie, and the mind hauing Commonweale-like and Kinglike soueraigntie ouer the soule. And therefore hee affirmeth that the ordinance of Gouernments, and of obedience vnto magistrates, is no lesse naturall than is the beginning and maintaining of ciuill societie. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit as the Philosophers of old time spake of matters more stately and cunningly
<pb facs="tcp:7218:16"/>
than the common people, so did they vse many wordes and phrases farre diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring from the common vse of speech. But yet of all others Aristotle laboured to shewe himselfe most obscure, vsing short speeches, and most commonly doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, which maketh him verie hard to be vnderstood, and more hard to be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated. Neuerthelesse, for the great profit that is to be receiued by the reading of him, he hath been translated into Latine, Arabicke, Hebrew, and many other Tongues: a sure token that for knowledge and cunning, he holdeth the chiefe roome in common reputation, and by vniuersall consent of all men. The which thing hath mooued me likewise to translate this worke of his into French, which I take to be very profitable and agreeable to the manner of our countrey. And if this my translation be not found to be so smooth and elegant as many other mens are, let them which shall looke vpon it, vouchsafe to consider, that in Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle not eloquence but substance is to be looked for: and that it is not possible to deliuer him other than he is in his owne originall Greeke: and yet that it were verie much to haue deliuered him as he is there, and to haue set downe his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning faithfully, keeping the proprietie of both the Languages. Notwithstanding to the intent he might be the better vnderstood and the easier to be dealt with, I haue added expositions taken out of the best Authours, and interlaced them throughout where need was, with examples of things done within mans remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, specially such as were nearest to our present age, and to mine owne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, in hope to make this worke of Ciuill Gouernment the more perfect by comparing things of olde time with the things of late time in euery sort of Gouernment.</p>

                  <hi>FOrasmuch as wee see that euery Citie or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweale <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> is a companie, and euery company is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> to some good: (for all men attempt and doe all things for that end and purpose, which in their opinion is good:) It is certaine that all companies tend vnto some good, and most chiefly and specially that the principall and most excellent companie of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> all companies, and comprehending all other socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, namely, the Citie or Ciuill societie; doth tend <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> and endeauour to attaine vnto the principall and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> most excellent good of all others.</hi>

               <p>In this entrance is shewed the excellencie and originall of a Common-weale, of what parts it consisteth, and to what end it is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ordained.</p>
               <p>FORASMVCH <hi>as we see that euery Common-weale is a companie.</hi>] Aristotle proueth the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> excellencie of a Common-weale by the soueraigne good which it purposeth, and by the ends thereof, which comprehendeth the ends of all humane things. His reason is this: Euery companie is ordained for some good; and euery Common-weale is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie: therefore euery Common-weale is ordained for some good. And if all compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> be ordained to some good; the better that the companie is, the greater good is it ordained for: But a Common-weale is the best of all companies; therefore of all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies it hath the greatest and chiefest good: and that is the soueraigne felicitie or wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, consisting both in the publique and in the priuat fruition of all kind of goods both of soule and bodie, and also of fortune. For that Common-weale is counted happie, which enioyeth all the three sortes of goods togither; the which to maintaine it selfe long time in prosperitie and safetie, it behooueth to be wise, mild, rich, iust, mightie, friendly to it selfe, and religious: wherein consist the common commodity, sufficiencie, discipline and honour of a Common-weale; as is affirmed by Aristotle himselfe in his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> first booke of Morals, &amp; in his seuenth booke of Gouernment or Matters of State: and by Plato in his fourth booke of his Common-weale, and in his third booke of Lawes. Now the linking in and communicating of men togither in a Common-weale, is to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers ends according to the gouernment thereof. If the gouernment be vnder one Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch or Soueraigne, it is to be defended against Strangers, and to liue lawfully and peaceably among themselues. If vnder a Senate or certaine number of Magistrates, it is to be regarded according to their riches, nobilitie, and vertue. If vnder popular gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is to enioy libertie and equalitie; and the better that any Common-weale is ordered, the more welfare and good doe men hope for therein.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> EVERIE <hi>companie is ordained for some good.</hi>] A companie, societie, or fellowship, is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> a knitting of many persons togither in consent, tending to some good or to some euill, carrying an outward shew or resemblance of good. For there is a good which is good in very deed; and there is a good which beareth but a likelihood of good, &amp; is not good in truth. Of this latter sort are euill gotten riches, and vice couered with vertue: as craft and subtiltie vaunting it selfe for wisdome, and prodigalitie for liberalitie. Now as there be three sortes of good, namely honest, profitable, and pleasant; so be there likewise three sortes of companies: one for profit, as Merchants; another for pleasure, as young folkes; a third for honestie, as the vertuous and skilfull. Aristotle speaketh here of the good companie, which is a consenting of many in the things that are good in truth,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> where right and order are to be found. As for the euill companies, they be made vnder pretence of good in shewe, wherethrough men are deceiued by taking the pretenced good for the true good indeed. That is to wit, by taking those things for profitable, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant, or honest, which in truth are not profitable, pleasant, nor honest, but hurtfull, te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, and loathsome. Of this sort are the companies of murtherers and theeues, which lie in waite to bereaue men of their goods and liues. Of the same sort are the routes of Ruffians, which follow shamefull delights: of the same sort also be the seditious and the conspirers against States and Princes, vnder some gay pretence of publicke libertie or of reformation of Gouernment, albeit that they seeke nothing but their owne pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> aduantage.</p>

And againe, forasmuch as in all Artes and Sciences the end that they aime at is some good or other, and the greatest and chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest good is aimed at by the chiefest of all Sciences, that is to say, the welfare of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke state. The nature of things is knowen chiefly by the end whereto they be ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> Now then, if the good for the which and the end whereunto a Common-weale is ordained, containe the ends of all other companies, and haue them comprehended vnder it; it followeth consequently that a Common-weale is the best companie, as saith Aristotle in the first chapter of his first booke of Morals to <hi>Nichomachus.</hi> For the more common that a good thing is, the more excellent also is it; like as it is more honorable and worthy of loue to prouide for whole Nations and Common-weales, than for pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar persons.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> NAMELY <hi>the Citie or ciuill societie.</hi>] That is to say, a multitude of people of vnlike sorts, (for so doth he himselfe say in the first chapter of his matters of State, and in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> third chapter of his third booke) as rich and poore, free and bond, gentlemen and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners, learned and vnlearned, handicrafts men and labourers, obeyers and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, communicating their Artes, trades, misteries, and exercises one to another in one place, to the end to liue the better and to haue the more sufficiencie. And also which obey the selfesame Lawes, Magistrates, and Soueraigne councill, called (by Plato in his twelfth booke of Lawes) the Anker, the head, and the Soule of a Common-weale. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner all the Venetians make one Common-weale, the people of Geneua another, and the people of Bern in Swisserland another. And it makes no matter whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they dwell all within walles or without, for a Citie or Common-weale is not to be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> accounted of by the walles, as Aristotle saith in the second chapter of his third booke of Matters of State. After the same manner all the naturall subiects of the French king, which acknowledge him for their Soueraigne lorde and obey his commandements and the ordinances of his councill, doe represent one Common-weale or bodie politique by diuers Townes, Cities, and Prouinces, of diuers Prouostships, Bailyships, Steward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships, Lieutenantships, Gouernments, &amp; Parliaments: of sundry Baronies, Earldoms,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:7218:17"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Marquiships, and Dukedomes: and of sundry Curatships, Bishoprickes, and Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprickes, sufficiently furnished in and by it selfe of all things needfull, as well in things necessarie as honest, not onely wherewith to liue well according to vertue, but also wherewith to liue commodiously and bountifully, hauing little or nothing to doe with others. Wherein no stranger may holde any office or benefice, or dispose of his owne goods, but that they shall become excheated after his decease, vnlesse he be made a free denison afore, and his letters patents ratified by the Iudges of accounts. On the contrarie part, there is not so meane a Frenchman borne of how base degree soeuer he be, but he may be aduanced to worship and honour for his valiantnes, or be preferred <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to the chiefest Ecclesiasticall dignities, or to the highest offices of Iustice, and of the princes reuenues, by his skilfulnes and vncorrupt behauiour.</p>
               <p>THEY <hi>therefore thinke not aright, which thinke that the gouernour of a Citie or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale, and a King, a housholder, and a lord or master ouer seruants are all one thing, esteeming them to differ one from another but onely in respect of moe or fewer in number (but not in kind and scope of gouernment) so as if a man haue the commanding of fewe folke, he shall bee but a Master; if of moe, an Housholder; and if yet of a greater number, the Gouernour of a Citie or Commonweale, or a King: as though a great house differed nothing at all from a little Citie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> or Commonweale, nor a Gouernour of a Commonweale from a King: and that a man were a King when hee ruleth alone; and a Gouernour of a Commonweale, when he both commaundeth and also obeyeth by turnes, according to the Reasons and Rules of that Science: which things are not true.</hi>

               <p>ARISTOTLE hauing shewed the Ciuill companie (which is called a Citie or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweale) to be better than all other particular societies of peculiar houses, hamlets, borowes, and other inferiour companies: all which, the ciuill societie or companie of a Citie or Common-weale comprehendeth, being perfecter than all the rest, for that it is more common and referred to a better end. He findeth fault with such as confound the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> publicke and priuate gouernments togither, and affirme that they are both one &amp; haue none other difference at all, sauing that the publick gouernments haue authoritie ouer greater numbers of people than the priuat haue. Wherein he noteth Plato, who in his Dialogue entituled The ciuill Magistrate, or as concerning Reigning, holdeth this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which Aristotle reprooueth. For Aristotle affirmeth that those Gouernments dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer one from another in kinde, not in respect of the persons that command and obey, which are both of one selfesame kind, but in respect that the gouernments themselues are diuers. The two priuat ones, that is to wit, that gouernment which the housholder vseth, and that which the lord or master vseth, do serue for the house, and doe differ both <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> betweene themselues and from the publicke. For the houshelder vseth another manner of commaunding towards his free folkes, that is to wit, his wife and children, than the Master doth towards his bondfolkes and seruants. The two publicke gouernments are the Regall and kingly gouernment, and the gouernment of a Citie or Commonweale, which likewise differ one from another, and also from the other afore-mentioned. For the gouernour of a citie or Commonweale commandeth his citizens and countrymen but for a time and by turnes, according to the lawes and customs of his commonweale: But the King commaundeth his subiects continually and according to his owne discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, specially the King that is called an absolute King, <note n="1" place="margin">Aristot. 3.

               <p>HERE the Philosopher sheweth the method or manner of handling which he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to vse in treating of this matter of Gouernment: that is to wit, his owne ordinary, which is to begin his bookes at the first grounds and principles of the things which he vndertaketh to speake of: as for example, intending in naturall Philosophie to speake of Nature, he beginneth at substance and shape: and in his booke of Wights, he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> first of the soule, and afterward of the parts of the wightes. Likewise hauing taken in hand to treat of common Societie, hee beginneth at the first and most single partes thereof, which are the companies of man and wife, of master and seruants, of father and children.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> SO SHALL <hi>wee knowe a Common weale by considering the parts whereof it is composed.</hi>] Like as a Wight may be deuided into head, brest, armes, feet, legges, heart, liuer, lights, and kidnies; and these againe into other parts till a man come euen to the first grounds which are the smallest and simplest parts of all: Likewise a Citie is deuided into streets, streetes into houses, houses into sortes of companies, and so forth to seuerall persons,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> which are the least vncompounded parts thereof, howbeit not simply as things naturall, but onely as in respect that they be parts of a Citie or of a Commonweale: for the arme or foot of a man is not a citizen, nor to be tearmed a part of a Common-weale.</p>
               <p>THEN <hi>if a man consider from the beginning how things are produced by nature, the order of proceeding in this behalfe will be verie good, as it is in all other cases. First it is requisite to ioyne these partes togither, which can not be one without the other, as the man and the woman for procrcation: and that not by way of choice, but in such sort as that there is a certaine naturall desire in all other liuing wights, and euen in the verie plants, to leaue a like of their owne kinde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> behind them.</hi>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> IT IS <hi>requisite to ioyne those partes togither which can not be one without another.</hi>] The first assembly necessarie for the constitution of a house or family, is the companie of the man and woman, for the continuall and perpetuall continuance of mankind by the meane of generation: for els there could be no mo families nor cities for want of men and women.</p>

Plato in his Banquet saith thus: See yee not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> with what great feruencie all liuing things as well those that flie in the aire as the rest that goe vpon the ground, are mooued and stirred when they enter into loue, and are desirous of generation? First of all they are very earnest to come togither, and then to prouide food for their little ones, for whome they are readie to fight, yea the weakest against the strongest, and to loose their liues in their behalfe: also they abide the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of hunger to bring their young ones vp, and all other things to the same effect.

Thus mankind being in this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> manner immortall, perseuereth to haue euerlasting being and continuance, in that by leauing children of children, the selfesame partie getteth immortalitie by way of pro-creation. Now it is not lawfull for any man voluntarily to depriue himselfe of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite of immortalitie, whereof he frustrateth himselfe wittingly that neglecteth wife and children. Aristotle in his second booke of the Soule, and the fourth Chapter, writeth thus: The act of generation is verie naturall to all liuing creatures, I meane such as be perfect, and not lame or defectiue in their members, and come not without seed: for from euerie one of them issueth his like, as the liuing creature issueth and commeth of one that hath life, and one plant commeth of another, to the end that in this sort they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> may be for euer, and as much as in them lieth, attaine to some diuine condition: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they are all very desirous, and for the same effect doe all whatsoeuer they doe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to nature. Forasmuch therefore as liuing wightes can not remaine alwaies, nor by continuance atchieue to any diuine estate (by reason that fraile and mortall things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine not alwaies the selfesame and one in number) euery one goeth about and endeuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth as much as he can by any possible means, to attaine to the participation of eternitie &amp; diuine condition, some more, some lesse, &amp; continueth not alwaies the selfesame, but rather such as he is, not in number, but in kind. The same Author in his second booke of the generation of liuing Wig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Also in the second booke of the Heauen and in the third chapter he writeth: There must of necessitie be generation, forasmuch as nothing lasteth alwaies: for contraries come togither, suffer one another, and are corrupted. He sheweth in his first booke of Generation and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, how generation lasteth for euer without any want thereof in the whole world. And in the tenth Chapter of the second booke, hee attributeth the cause of the same <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> continuance, to the moouing of the Heauen and the obliquity of the Zodiacke. For when the Sunne draweth neere, it stirreth vp the springing and growth of all things, and when it withdraweth it selfe a farre off, it is the cause of their death and ruine. And withall that the life of all things and the times, are bounded and limited by numbers, some shorter, some longer, according to the disposition and aptnes o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

What manner of skill then is this, as well in all li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing wights as in man, that no kind of them fadeth away, and lasteth euer perfect and immortall? Nature hath giuen to all liuing creatures apt instruments with speciall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to conceiue, for generations sake: and to the soule maruellous and vnspeakeable desire to vse the same: By which all creatures are stirred and pricked on, as well sots and fooles, as yong folke and those that be void of reason: prouiding thereby for the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of their kind, as though they were endued with wit and discretion.

               <p>NEXT <hi>of all it is expedient to ioine together, one that commandeth by nature, and another that obayeth, for their mutuall preseruation.

               <p>THE second assembly necessary for the constitution of a house or family proceeding from nature, as the former; is that of the maister and seruant naturally affected one to another: which the Philosopher tearmeth, Lordly or maisterly.

This said Aristotle: from the which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> if wee shall separate the former only conceit touching the first essences and beeing of the gods, surely we may account this to be a diuine saying: and that Philosophie, as it is likely, often times found out as farre as it was possible (though afterwards lost them againe) such excellent opinions, which as rare reliques it preserued vntill our age.

Now, than the forme of man what is more excellent? You may annex a third reason, and that is, that the dwelling place of vnderstanding can set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and remaine in no other forme nor subiect, then in it. Moses in the first Chapter of Genesis saith: God created man after his owne Image, after the image of God created he him, male and female created hee them.

Abdala, one of the wise Sarazens or Arabians, beeing at a time demanded, What was the most admirable thing in the habitable earth, answered: That there was nothing in the world to be seen more admirable &amp; wonderful then Man: with whom conspireth Mercurius Trismegist, who calleth Man, a great miracle. And most certaine it is, that Man is begotten of an excellent quality and condition, euen after the image and similitude of God, and as it were, of the stocke and linage of God, to celebrate his honour and imitate his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to the end hee may view the order of celestiall bodies, and keepe and defend the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation of this middle terrestriall globe. He is adorned with a diuine vnderstanding, togither with knowledge able to discerne betwixt truth and falshoode, and put a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt good and euill; and with wisdome to consider the principles and causes of things, with their consequences and repugnances; and with memory to call to mind things past, and combine that which is to come with the time present. He is partaker of reason, by means whereof men are associated to ech other in the communion of speech and life. The shape of his body is proportioned agreeable to his vnderstanding, togither with many commodities and fitnesses of exterior and interior members, accompanied <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> with senses and affections: he is sharpe, prouident, subtill, borne to contemplation and action: amongst all creatures (ouer whome he is placed as prince and ruler) hee onely hath the knowledge of God his Creator: And wheras other creatures do either looke downeward to their food, or creepe on the earth, or liue couered with water, hee is of stature straight erected towards the aspect of heauen, the originall place of his true pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digree, beholding both that which is aloft and below, first, last, and middest, because the inquisition and search of truth belongeth properly vnto him: and contemplating the heauen, starres, earth, water, liuing creatures, plants, stones, and mettals, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of all things; he commeth at last to know God the moderator and gouernour of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> all: to whome also in his ordinary affaires and continuall afflictions, he hath recourse by prayer, imploring his aid: and seruing him sincerely by a true religion, aspireth at length to eternall felicitie. By man all lawes and customes were appointed, equitie iustly prescribed, and a certaine discipline of liuing inuented, the better &amp; more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily to conduct our liues. What should I reckon the innumerable Arts, inuentions, and excellent sciences found out by him, to furnish life with things necessary and honest? wherfore it seemeth that by good reason he holdeth the chiefe roome of dignity in this world, being also called of many, A little world; in as much as the same things which are in the great world, are also found to haue place in him: the fire, the aire, the water, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> the earth, mingled and tempered togither, are really &amp; substantially in his compound body: within the wals wherof dwelleth a spirit more pure and diuine then the elements, answering proportionably to heauen, &amp; coupling (as Aristotle saith) the soule to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. In him is the life of plants, performing the same offices, namely, to ingender, norish, and grow, as in them. In him is the sense of bruit beasts, both interior and exterior. In him inhabites a soule ful of reason, an vnderstanding diuinely added therunto, bodiles, passionles, and immortal: and lastly, a conuenience and agreement of all these natures

To vnderstand the better this place, it is to be obserued, that vertue is taken in a double sense, the one properly, as it is defined in the 2. booke of Ethickes, namely to be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> an electiue habite consisting in mediocritie, referred vnto vs, and limited by reason. In this signification vertue is not seuered from a right reason, neither can any abuse it to vice or dishonestie. In the other sense it signifieth improperly, a certaine ability or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines, wherewith some can easily perfourme that which good men accomplish by true and sound vertue, as to abstaine from whoredome, prodigality, and rashnes, although they doe it with an euill will and intent.

The same <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> reason is of Prudence or Wisdome, the which if it be taken properly, to wit, for a habit of gouerning our selues by reason in things that are good or hurtfull to man (as it is defined in the sixt booke of Ethickes) no man can in this sence abuse it to an euill ende, because it is as it were the Architect and builder of other vertues, by prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing vnto them what is most meete and conuenient for them.

In this sense an vniust man may right well abuse this Prudence improperly taken, which is indeede nothing else but craft and subtiltie. Cicero <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>De natur.

               <p>
                  <hi>NOW for as much as it hath beene declared of what partes a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Cittie consisteth of necessitie, wee will first speake of the gouernment of a family: for euery Cittie is composed of families, and the partes of a familie be those whereof it is immediatly compacted. But for that the nature of euery thing is to bee considered in the best partes thereof, and forasmuch as the first and best partes of a familie are the master and seruant, the husband and wife, the father and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, wee will entreat of these three, what each of them is, and what they ought to be, to wit, of the masterly, husbandly, and fatherly societie. There is yet another part which some men thinke to be Oeconomie, and others take to be the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> part of a family: concerning the which, wee will also entreate what it is, I meane, that which consisteth in acquiring and getting of goods and possessions both mooueable and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooueable. But let vs first of all deale with the master and seruant, that wee may knowe what appertaineth to necessarie vse, and whether wee can attaine to any better knowledge therein then is now in the common opinion of men: for some holde opinion, that the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of a master is a kinde of science, and that the authoritie of a master and Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomie, or ordering a familie; and the gouernment of a Cittie or Common-wealth, and the kingly state and gouernment are all one and of the selfe same kinde and nature: as wee haue alreadie touched at the beginning. Others thinke that the authoritie and gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> of a master and his bondman is against nature, sith it is the force of lawe that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth one a bondman and another a free man, who notwithstanding differ nothing in nature: and therefore conclude they that it is not iust, but a thing maintained by violence. Now for as much as goods and possessions are partes of a familie, doubtlesse the skill to get goods shall be a part of the Oeconomie: forasmuch as it is not possible to liue, much lesse to liue well, without necessarie prouision: for as in Artes definite it is expedient and needefull <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> to haue instruments and tooles fitte and conuenient for the performance of their worke;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:7218:27"/>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>conomie of a famile: Now of instruments there be some that haue life,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> and others that are without life: as for example, in a shippe the sterne is a liuelesse instrument, and the Mariner that hath charge of the foreship is liuing: because that in artificiall affaires the Maister or seruant supplieth the place of an instrument. In like manner goods are instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments seruing to the vse of mans life: and to possesse goods, is nothing els but to possesse a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of instruments, and a seruant is a liuing possession, and euery Minister an instrument ouer instruments: for if instruments could at their maisters becke and commandement, or by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> any precedent sence of their owne, performe their worke, as it is reported of the statues of Dedalus, or Treuets of Vulcan, which the Poet affirmeth to haue come of themselues to the battaile of the gods: and so also of the weauers shuttles, and af the quill or bowe of a Violl,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> that they woue and played of their owne accord: I say, if it were thus, then cheefe builders <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> should haue no need of seruants, nor lord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of slaues. They therefore which are called instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, are operatiue and working instruments, but the possession of goods is an actiue instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for by a Weauers shittle a certaine thing is made and left besides the vse of it: but of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> a garment or a bed wee haue nothing but the vse. Moreouer, sith that operation differeth from action in kind, and sith either of them hath need of instruments, it is necessary that these instruments also of either kinde haue the same difference. As therefore life is an action, not an operation; so a seruant is a Minister vnto that which concerneth action: besides a possession is called to bee as it were a part, for a part is not onely the part of another thing, but wholly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> and absolutely of another thing, and so likewise is a possession: and therefore a lord or master is the master of a bondslaue or seruant onely, and not in the power of the seruant or bondslaue: but the bondslaue is not onely the bondslaue of his maister, but wholly and entirely in his power. By all which it is easie to bee knowne what is the nature and condition of a bondslaue: for hee that is not his owne by nature, but another mans, and yet a man, the same is by nature a bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaue. Now hee is another mans, who so euer being a man is possessed of another, and a thing pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> is nothing els but an actiue and seperate instrument.</hi>

               <p>BEFORE he wadeth any deeper into the discourse of a Cittie or Common-wealth,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> the Philosopher inserteth here a disputation touching Oeconomie and the parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which continueth to the end of this first booke: the which parts are euidently set downe by him in expresse tearmes, called a Husbandly, Fatherly, and Maisterly socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. This last is expounded and declared from the thirde Chapter to the end of the fourth: where, vpon good occasion, is handeled most learnedly the manner of comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and obeying: and after hauing defined what it is to serue and to bee a bondslaue; hee resolueth vpon this, that some are borne in that estate and condition to serue and obey: shewing that by nature they are properly slaues, which are dull and grosse of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, but puissant and strong of bode, to exercise necessairie workes and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> and that on the other side they are by nature Maisters and Lords borne to command, which are indued with iudgement and wisedome of mind, but feeble of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and that the same is profitable to two purposes, both that the wise may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and the strong obey. Besides these three parts of Oeconomie fore-expressed, a fourth is adioyned, called Acquisitiue, that is to say, a facultie of gett<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Instruments whereby besides the vse ariseth a certaine worke wrought, are called Operatiue: As from the shittle ariseth the webbe, from the Aule, shooes, from the needle and the scizers, a coat or a shirt: but those whereof nothing redoundeth but the bare vse, are called Actiue, as the Virginals, the Viall, and the Lute, which after they once leaue sounding, there remaineth nothing behind to be seene. This profession of goods is an actiue instrument: because there is nothing required in it but vse onely: as in putting on a gowne or a shirt, or sitting in a chaire, there is nothing left after the vse of them.</p>

And we see in man compounded of a body, a soule, and vnderstanding; that the soule commandeth the body, and the vnderstanding the appetite or will. Then proceeding from a particular man to a family compact of many persons, wee see howe the father as a king naturally hath authority ouer his children, the Maister as a tyrant ruleth his bondslaue with more violence, and the husband commandeth his wife after a ciuill manner.

And forasmuch as in vicious &amp; naughtie persons, because they are naughtily &amp; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> vnnaturally disposed, oftentimes the bodie seemeth to ouerrule the soule. Therefore, first as I said,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> there appeareth in man both these gouernments, the maisterly, and Polliticke: for the soule ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the body like a maister: and vnderstanding, the will after a King like and polliticke manner. Whereby it is manifest, that by the direction of nature, the body is subiect to the soule: And the part encombred with perturbations, to the vnderstanding or part endued with reason: and that equality and enterchange of gouernment is hurtfull to all, as well men as brute beasts. For tame and mansuet beasts are better by nature, then wild and sauage: and yet it is most expedient for all, both tame and wild to be in subiection to man: sith therein consisteth their safety. Moreouer, if we compare togither the male and the female, we shall find, that by natures law the male as bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> commandeth, and the female as inferiour obeyeth, and is subiect: And the like reason is also necessarily to bee had in all men.</hi>

For euen as in a man the soule, which is the better part, sits as president and gouernour; and the body as the worser, waiteth and obeyeth as a seruant: so in like manner in euery humane societie or assembly, the wisest ought to sit in the chaire of authority, and the vnaduised to stand and attend at <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> their beckes: hauing need of the conduct, counsell, and protection of another. The first kinde of gouernement, which is obserued in man, is the Lordly, or maisterly, after which sort the soule commaundeth the body: for the body is constrained to obey the soule, because it quickeneth and moueth it, neither hath any proper or peculiar motion of it owne, without the helpe and assistance of the soule; and therefore must yeelde such obedience vnto it, as a bondslaue yeeldeth vnto his Maister: who is so farre from being his owne man, that he is wholly in the power and iurisdiction of another, no lesse

                  </gap>, which signifieth a binder. From this kind of priuate commanding, sprung vp a most rigorous forme of Publicke gouernment, in the which the Lord hath a most absolute and vncontrouleable authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, hauing full power ouer the life and death of his subiects, as in olde time the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the King of Persia was, as witnesseth Plato <hi>De Legib. lib.</hi> 3. and Isocrates in his <hi>Panegerick,</hi> and as is at this day the authority of the great Turke, who doth all things at his pleasure without the controulement of Lawe or Counsell, and whose subiects are constrained to obay him like brute beasts, and to doe whatsoeuer hee commandeth. The <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> Muscouite and Prester Iohn haue also the same forme of Regiment. The other kinde of commanding, is Polliticke and Regall, by the which the vnderstanding part, or mind, ruleth the desiring facultie or appetite, by a certaine law, tending to common profit: and not by violence, constraining it to obey. For foreseeing that which would bee either hurtfull or profitable vnto it, it gouerneth and bridleth it to the especiall defence and safety of the whole body: from which manner of naturall gouernement haue issued all iust and lawfull formes of Empires. Now we must note, whereas hee saith, that the mind exerciseth a Polliticke and Regall gouernement ouer the appetite, that this is to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of the reasonable appetite, for sometimes it happeneth, that the will and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> appetite commandeth the mind in matters of faith, and in those thinges which surpasse the common capacity of vnderstanding: and sometimes againe the mind com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the will in thinges which it appr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As for the sensuall appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, it neuer exerciseth authority ouer the vnderstanding: but contrariwise, the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> alwaies ought to gouerne and rule it: the which kind of gouernement is not politicall, but rather Maisterly, I meane in those, whose affections are slauish and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious against reason: but in those that are well borne by nature, and well qualified by education, it vseth a Regall and paternall forme of gouernment.

Hee applieth to these three parts of the soule, three sorts of people, necessary for the establishment of a Common-wealth: To Reason he compareth the gouernours and rulers; to Anger, the souldiours and men of warre; to Concupiscence the Labourers, Artificers and Marchaunts. Also that each of these parts are guided and conducted by their peculiar vertue: Reason by Wisedome, Anger by Fortitude, and Concupiscence by Temperance: and that when these three parts of the soule within vs, and those three sorts of people in Common-wealths, execute their iust duties and offices, according to the prescription of those three aforesaied vertues, without meddling or encroching with one another; then wee may iustly auouch, that that man is well ordered, and that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Common-wealth well gouerned: and contrarily, when those Offices and duties are transgressed.</p>

vnreasonable, that hee which is vanquished by force, should become seruant and subiect <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> to him, who by force can vanquish him and is more strong: There are diuers opinions of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> this matter euen among the wisest themselues. The cause of such doubting and varietie is, because that vertue (accompanied with abilitie and meanes) is able very much to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine: and also the vanquisher is alwayes in some preheminence of goodnesse, in such sort, that strength seemeth not to be without vertue: So that the question is now only of the equitie. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Therefore some account that to be equitie and right, which is wrought by loue: Others, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> which hee that is most mightie, commaundeth.

The Romane Ciuill lawyers make this diuision of Law: There is (say they) the law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the law of Nations; all men by the former of these are borne free from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning: and bondage is contrary to nature, brought in by the law of Nations, which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> sprung vp after the law of Nature: insinuating thereby a certaine state of bondage, in the which in time of warre the Conquerour retaineth his captiue.

And if such as these will not suffer themselues to be gouerned, they ought to be compelled by force, and oppressed by strength, to the end, that the residue of humane kinde may be preserued.

Notwithstanding, sith the possessing of goods, is as it were an instrument <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of housekeeping, and of gouernment, there is no doubt but it hath some end as well as other instruments, which are each of them appointed and directed to their owne end. Plinie woondring at and much dispraising mens couetousnesse and vnsatiable desire to heape richesse vpon richesse, which neuer findeth end, and by meanes whereof man can neuer enioy blessednesse and felicity, which consisteth in a contented and setled minde: Well (sayth hee) Let vs take a man that hath heaped together so much gold and siluer, as that he may be said to haue innumerable richesse, yet shall he be nothing in comparison of a man that I will tell you of, who was neither any king, nor had any Princedome that might counteruaile a kingdome: It was that Ptolomeus who was at so great charge to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> aid Pompey when he subdued Iury, that he entertained vpon his owne wages and costs eight thousand horsemen, and at the same time made a feast, whereat were a thousand men sitting at his table, who had euery one their cuppe of gold, and vpon the seruing of euery messe, hee changed their cuppes of gold into other golden cuppes of a newe fashion. Howbeit (saieth hee) his richesse is but a small portion in comparison of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chesse of Pythius of Bithinia, who gaue to Darius king of Persia a plaine Tree of gold with a Vine of gold, wherof there went so great fame, and is still kept in so great remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance. And after the same Pythius through his liberall hospitality and housekeeping, receaued king Xerxes, sonne of the said Darius, at such time as hee made his expedition <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> against Greece in hostile manner, and ledde his army with him, amounting to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of seuen hundred thousand men: this Pythius feasted them for one day in a ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet. And for that the same Pythius had fiue sonnes, and the king had made proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that all men who were able and fit to weare armour, should passe with him into Greece; hee offered the king to pay his army for the space of fiue moneths, and to prouide it Corne during that time, in the name of his children: and in recompence thereof, onely demanded resp it for his eldest sonne to stay at home and not goe into the Warres: to the end, that in the absence of the other foure, he might gouerne his fathers age. And although this Pythius was thus rich, yet for all that, Plinie affirmeth, that hee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> was not to bee compared with Cresus king of Lydia, who had an infinite number of golde. Therefore it is want of Wisedome in a man to set his heart so farre vpon coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse, the end whereof is nothing els but to possesse great reuenues: and there haue beene diuerse bondmen which haue beene of greater ability in richesse, then the most famous kings.

Pallas was the Emperour Neroes slaue, and got so much vnder him after hee was set at libertie, that hee was owner of three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand sexterces, as Cornelius Tacitus affirmeth, which in value amount to seuen milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> and fiue hundred thousand Crownes. Pliny affirmeth, that the same Pallas was richer then Crassus, though Crassus had in landes and inheritances the value of fiue millions of golde: and though hee was called the rich man of his time, and the richest of all the Romanes next to Silla; neuerthelesse, in the time of Claudius the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, there were three villaines or bondslaues, namely, Pallas, Callistus, and Narcissus, who were euery one richer then hee.

Notwithstanding, before his time money was in vse at Rome, howbeit not fully come to perfection at that time. The first print or marke of the same, was Pecus,<note place="margin">That is the Image of a sheepe or oxe.</note> and therefore all money made and marked with any stampe, was called Pecunia. It is reported that one Phidon in the Island of Egina, first coyned sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer money, and that Saturnus after his arriuall in Italy, made brasse money, and stamped it with the Image of the hinder part of a ship. The people of Rome vsed brasse money, till the time of king Pyrrhus, and from thence forward began to make siluer mony: and after the ouercomming of Carthage, made gold monyes. God in the 25 Chapter of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Exodus, commaunded Moyses to take gold and siluer of the children of Israel for the building of the Tabernacle. Ioseph in Egypt commanding his brethrens sackes to be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with corne, caused siluer to be put into euery sackes mouth, and his siluer cup in his yoongest brothers sacke, and afore that time Ioseph had beene sold for thirty pence.

                  <hi>HEreby is resolued the doubt put foorth in the beginning, namely, Whether Art acquisitiue, or the skill of getting money, doe belong to the gouernour of a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to the gouernor of a Commonweale, or not. But this must be first prepared: For
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:7218:40"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> as the skill of politicall gouernement dooth not make men, but taking them from Nature <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> dooth vse them: so must Nature furnish vs with nourishment, either from the Earth, the Sea, or some other thing. But it is the office of the Gouernour of the family to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the ordering and bestowing of these thinges: For it is not the Weauers Occupation to make wooll, but to vse the same, and to discerne and iudge which is good and meete to make cloth, and which naught and vnprofitable. For a question might bee asked, Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> this skill of getting should bee parcell of the Houshold gouernement, and not Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke: Yet must the health of all the Houshold bee prouided for as well as their victuals and other necessary maintenance. For in some respect it is the office and charge, as well <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of the gouernour of a house, as the gouernour of a Common-weale, to prouide for the health of those whome they haue vnder them, and in some respect not, but the Phisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Euen so the charge and ouersight of the furnishing of money in one respect belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to the Gouernour of the house, and in another respect not, but to the skill and facultie which serueth thereunto. Notwithstanding (as it hath beene alreadie al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged) it is most necessarie to haue goods prepared by Nature, whose dutie it is to prouide foode for all thinges that are engendred: For that which resteth and remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth of that whereof euery thing is engendred, is the foode vnto it. Therefore the meane of getting of money, as well by fruites, as by liuing Creatures, is in all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> thinges agreeable to Nature. And whereas the same is double (as wee haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged) the one consisting in engrossing and selling againe of commodities, the other pertaining to the defence of the houshold wealth: and this last necessarie and commendable: but the other which engroseth and selleth commodities, worthtly bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, beca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Nowe, forasmuch as wee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> haue sufficientlie decided what concerneth knowledge of these thinges: nowe let vs come to the practise. All such thinges haue their knowledge and contemplation free, but their practise and experience necessarie. The cheefe and principall point of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> of money, is to bee expert and skilfull in knowing where and howe such wares and commodities as are to bee acquired and gotten, are best and most profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table: as to vnderstand the nature of Horses, of Oxen, of Sheepe, and of all other <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Creatures. For it is requisite that a manne haue skill in comparing euery sort and kinde one with another, to knowe which is the best, and to discerne and iudge of them according to the places and soiles where they bee bredde, because the breede of one <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> Countrey is better then another. Next of all, it is behoo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

These bee the cheefe partes of the skill and meane of true getting of money. As concerning that way and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> meane which consisteth in exchaunge, the principall part thereof is Marchaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> whereof there bee three kindes; Nauigation by Sea, Portation by Land, and vtterance of commodities in those places where they growe, called in Greeke <gap reason="foreign">

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> vsurie: the third part is laborious working for money and wages, which consisteth in han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicrafts,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> and in artificiall Trades which are behoofefull for the bodie onely. The fourth part is a meane betweene this last and the first, for it containeth part of that which is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Nature, and the Art of that which consisteth in exchanging, and comprehendeth all those commodities which growe in the earth or depend of the same, being fruitlesse, and yet profitable, as the felling of Timber and vnderwoods, and all the industrie and skill that is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Amongst Occupations, those are most artificiall where for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> hath least place: those most noisome whereby mens bodies are most defiled and pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: those most slauish wherein there is most vse of bodily strength: and those most vile wherein the least vertue is required. But forasmuch as diuerse men haue written of these <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> matters, as Charetides the Parian, and Apollodorus the Lemnean, of the manuring of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> grounds both vnplanted and planted, and diuerse other Authours haue treated of like matters: whosoeuer listeth to haue further knowledge therein, let him read their bookes. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> Moreouer, it were verie good to gather further meanes by such reports as goe abroad of men that haue been rich: for such kinde of speeches are behoofefull vnto them that make <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> account of richesse: as that which Thales the Milesian practised, seruing for an inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to get money, which is fathered vpon him in respect of his excellent skill, though it may fall out generally: for when this man was reproched and vpbraided with his pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as though Philosophie were vnprofitable, it is reported, that before the end of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, hee foresawe by his skill in Astrologie, that there would bee plentie of Oliues the Summer following, and that hee got a small portion of money, and gaue earnest to the husbandmen, the owners of those places where the Oliues grew, and so procured and bought good cheape all the Oliues that were about Milet and Chio, by reason there was no man at that time that offered more. Nowe, when the time of their gathering was come,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> and many men standing in neede thereof, hee solde them quickely for as much as hee listed, and by that meanes got together a great summe of money: shewing that it was an easie matter for Philosophers to waxe rich when they listed, but that it was not their studie nor profession. Thales is reported to haue made this triall of his Wisedome. This manner of getting of money is vniuersall, (as wee haue before alleadged) when any one man dooth obtaine vnto himselfe the Monopolie and wholesale of any kinde of commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> Therefore diuerse Cities, when they stand in neede of money to bee employed in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> the affaires of their Common-weales, doe ordaine and appoint this manner of getting of money, by reseruing to themselues alone the libertie to sell certaine commodities. In <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> Sicilie there was a manne that had certaine money deliuered vnto him to keepe, who with the same bought vp all the yron in the yron Forges: and vpon the arriuall of Marchaunts from other Countries, hee alone solde it without any great enchauncement of the price: Howbet with fiftie Talents, hee gained a hundred Talents. Dionise the Tyrant vnderstanding thereof, gaue him license to carie away his goods, but forbadde him to dwell any longer in Syracusa, because hee had inuented such meanes to get money, as was not behoofefull to his affaires. Thales and this man aymed at one marke, which was to finde out a mane to haue the Monopoly and sole vtterance of commodities. The knowledge of which meanes is also behoofefull for gouernours of Common-weales: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> many Cities and Common-weales haue as great, yea and more neede of goods and reuenues, then any priuate familie: Insomuch, that some persons, that haue pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke charges and Offices, are employed onely about the treasurie and ouersight of these matters.</hi>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> THE resolution of the whole discourse touching the Art Acquisitiue, of getting &amp; prouiding money and goods is, that it properly doth not belong to the Oeconomicall skill of housekeeping, and to the politicall faculty of Gouernement but ought to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede and serue vnto each of them, to the end, that victuals and necessary goods want not in houses and Cities, which are there to be distributed by housholders and Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours: who if by chance they busie themselues about the getting thereof, do it as good husbands. The skill of getting, which is agreeable to nature, is honestly exercised, in Cattell, in Corne, and in the fruits of Trees. The artificiall and crafty meane of getting of money by engrosing vp of commodities, and vttering them againe for gaine, is bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> And amongst all kinds of gaine, vsury is most reproued, which begetteth mony of mony against Nature, and the intent wherefore money at the beginning was ordained: which was of purpose for the exchanging of such commodities, as were hard to bee transported. There is another manner of getting which holdeth a meane between these two, and consisteth in the employment of such naturall commodities as serue not for victuals and clothing, and are ruled and exchaunged for the obtaining of whatsoeuer is needfull for the maintenance of mankind.

               <p>
                  <hi>NOw forasmuch as wee haue alleadged before, that there bee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> three parts whereof the gouernment of a familie consisteth; and haue already spoken of the Maisters part: here will wee intreate of those parts which seuerally belong to the father and the husband: For the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> good man of the house gouerneth his wife and children, each of them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> as free folke, howbeit not with the selfe-same manner of gouernment, but his wife ciuilly, and his children regally: for the male by Nature hath more authoritie then the female, vnlesse it befall otherwise in some place contrary to Nature: and the elder and perfecter, then the yoonger and vnperfecter. In the most gouernements of Citties and Common-weales, the ruler and obeyer doe chaunge by turnes, because they will bee equall according to Nature, and not differ in anie respect: Howbeit, when the one gouerneth and the other obeyeth, there is a difference sought both in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell, in speech, and in honours: as Amasis answered concerning the Basin wherein hee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> vsed to wash his feete: But the male is alwaies disposed toward the female in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> The gouernment ouer children is regall, because the engendrer gouerneth both in respect of friendship, and by the prerogatiue of his age: which is a kinde of kingly gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Therefore dooth Homer rightly tearme Iupiter, Father both of men and gods: who is the King of all. For a King must excell in Nature, and bee of the same kinde, as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falleth to the elder compared with the yoonger, and the engendrer with his child: whereby it appeareth, that the houshold gouernement ought to haue greater care and regard of men, than of the possessing of such thinges as haue no life: and of mens vertues, then of the commoditie and force of thinges possessed; which wee call riches: and of free folke, than of bondslaues. But first as concerning these villaines and bondmen, it may bee doubted, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> besides that they serue for instruments and ministers, there bee any other vertues in them honourabler then these; as modestie, manhood, iustice, and other such habites: Or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they bee destitute of all other vertues, sauing those that pertaine to the bodie and sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery. For it may bee a doubt on both sides, as if they haue, howe much they differ from free men? And it were altogether absurd to say they haue them not, sith they be men and partakers of reason. In a manner the same doubt may bee mooued touching the woman and the childe, Whether there be any vertues in them: and whether the woman should bee temperate, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:7218:44"/>
and iust: and the child intemperate, or temperate, or not. And vniuersally, the like <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> may bee considered in the obeyer by Nature and the gouernour, Whether there bee in them one selfesame or a diuerse vertue: if each of them participate of one and the selfesame vertue, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore should the one rule, and the other obey continually? They cannot differ according to more or lesse: because obeying and gouerning differ in kind, and not in respect of more or lesse. On the other side, it were a wonder that vertue should bee desired in the one, and not in the other. For except the gouernour bee temperate and iust, h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>w will hee gouerne well? or if the subiect bee not, howe shall bee well obey? Verily, being intemperate and fearefull, hee will doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is comely and meete. Therefore it appeareth, that it is necessary for each of them to participate of vertue, in such difference neuerthelesse as is found in those thinges that are in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> subiection by Nature: This is straightway perceaued in the soule where the one part com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth by Nature, and the other obeyeth: The vertue of which partes wee affirme to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, as the vertue of that part which is indued with reason; and the vnreasonable part. It is certaine that the like is obserued in other thinges, insomuch, that by Nature there bee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers sorts of rulers and obeyers: For the free man gouerneth the bondman one way, the male the female another way, and the man the childe after another sort: and in all them are the parts of the soule, howbeit with difference: The bondman is altogether depriued of that part which belongeth to deliberation: The wife hath it, howbeit weake: The childe hath it also, but imperfect. The like is to bee deemed of the morrall vertues. And wee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> must suppose, that they ought to haue them: howbeit, not after the same maner and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, but in such measure as is conuenient for the office and exercise of euery one. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is expedient for a gouernour to haue perfect morrall vertue: for his office is simply and absolutely to command and giue order for the execution of affaires, and reason beareth the sway in commanding and appointing: But it sufficeth euery of the other persons to haue such portion of the same, as is needfull <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>or their owne exercise. Let vs conclude therefore, that all the persons afore mentioned haue morrall vertue: and that the modestie of the husband and wife are not the selfe same, nor their Fortitude, nor Iustice, as Socrates helde opinion: but the one hath Fortitude apt to gouerne, the other to serue: and likewise in other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> as more plainely may appeare by the particular consideration of the same. For they that speake vniuersally, doe deceaue themselues, who affirme that the hauing of the soule well disposed, or well doing, or any other like thing, is vertue: But they which number the vertues (as Gorgias did) say farre better then the others, that thus define it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is behoofefull so to deeme of all vertues, as a certaine Poet did of a womans si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, saying that silence was an ornament to her, but not to the man in like sort. Sith therefore the childe is vnperfect, doubtlesse his vertue ought not to bee imputed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, but to the perfecter, and him that is his gardian and gouernour: and likewise to the Maister, the vertue of the Seruant, who is behoofefull to his Maister in necessarie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> affaires; and yet for that purpose hath neede but of small vertue, namely of so much as may s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rue his turne, in such sort, that through intemperancie or slouthfulnesse, hee faile not in doing of his dutie. If this that wee haue affirmed bee true, it may bee further doubted, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther artificers should haue vertue, because they often make default in their exercises, by means of intemperancie. But there is a great vnlikelihood betweene these: for the bondman liueth with vs, but the artificer is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>arther of. Who hath neede of as much vertue as hee hath seruitude: for the vile craftsman dooth serue a certaine kinde of seruitude which is compassed within li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits and bounds. Moreouer, a seruaunt is one of those thinges that consist by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but not the Shooe-maker nor any other crafts-man. Therefore the Maister is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> the cause that the seruant hath such vertue, and not euery one that hath a certaine Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterly skill to teach seruile exercises. Therefore are they deceiued that would depriue seruants of reason, alleadging that they should onely execute that which is giuen them in commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Rather it is conuenient to admonish and instruct them more then children. Wee haue for this peesent sufficiently spoken of these matters. But as concerning the husband and wife, the father and children, and of euery of their vertues and mutuall conseruation: and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:7218:44"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> by what meanes they follow good and flye euill, wee shall necessarily treat thereof in our discourse of the formes of gouernment. For sith euerie house is parcell of the Cittie, and all the matters aboue spoken of are parts of the house, and the vertue of the part is to bee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to the whole, it is necessary to referre the instruction and ordering of women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to such Magistrates as haue the ouersight of the States of Cities; if it bee conuenient for the making of a vertuous Citie to haue vertuous women and children: which is most requisite, for that women are the moytie of free men, and of children do come the partakers and fellowes of the Common-wealth, and of the gouernment of the Cittie: insomuch, that sith wee haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie spoken of these matters, and are to treat of the rest else-where, leauing this disputation as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> perfect and brought to an end, wee will begin with another matter, and first examine the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of other men concerning the establishment of the best sort of gouernement of a Cittie or Common-weale.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THERE were three parties of houshould gouernement propounded: the first of the Maister, the second of the Father, the third of the Husband. Vpon the discussing of the Maisters part with the skill of getting which was added vnto them, nowe those parts which belong to the Father and the Husband are layed foorth. In that part which belongeth to the Father, the children are gouerned by the Father regally, as well <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> through friendship and prerogatiue of perfect age, as with the good will of the children, who willingly obey their Fathers. In that part which belongeth to the Husband, The Husband hath ciuill gouernement ouer his wife, not in respect of the equalnesse of the man and the wife, and gouerning by turnes, which neither are nor ought to bee in them, but in regard of the courage, strength, authoritie, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie and wisedome both in wordes and deedes, which commonly Nature affoordeth in greater quantitie to the man than to the woman: and for that as hee is the perfecter and better, so is hee the honourabler. Euen as the ciuill Magistrate, during his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice excelleth all priuate persons in apparrell, in countenance, in manner of speech and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> in honours. After are declared those morrall vertues, which bee interchangeably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite in gouernours and obayers, and in what difference they ought to haue them, accordingly as is meete for their Offices and exercises: taking a similitude from the parts of mans soule, where the part endued with reason, as superiour, gouerneth; and the vnreasonable part, his inferiour, obeyeth: hauing difference in their vertues.</p>
               <p>NOVV <hi>forasmuch as wee haue alleadged, that there bee three parts whereof the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> gouernement of a familie consisteth.</hi>] From the first Chapter to the last of this present <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Booke, hee speaketh almost of no kinde of matter but the skill of housekeeping, as farre as it may serue to the gouernement of the Cittie: where at his beginning to reason thereof, hee had propounded three societies of persons, necessarie for the establishment of a perfect familie, namely, that of the Maister and Seruant, called Maisterly or Signiorall, which he hath discussed, and the other two, which are of the Husband and the Wife, and of the Father and the Children, of the which hee speaketh here.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>good man of the house gouerneth his wife and children, but his wife ciuilly, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> his children regally.</hi>] That the likenesses of three gouernements doe appeare in the ordering of a family, Aristotle dooth shewe in his eight booke of Morall Philosophie to Nicomachus. The similitudes (sayeth hee) and as yee would say, the examples of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernments, may be taken out of familes: for the assembly of the father &amp; his children is like a kingdome, forasmuch as the father hath a care of his chidre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: Vpon the which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion Homer calleth Iupiter Father, for that the fathers gouernment will be a kingdome.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:7218:45"/>
but amongst the Persians the fathers gouernment is Tyrant-like, in that they vse their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> children as slaues. The maisters gouernment ouer his slaues is tyrannicall, whereby all things are conueyed to the maisters profite: so that the one gouernement is lawfull, and the other which is after the Persian manner faultie. The gouernement of the man and the woman resembleth the Aristocratie: for the man in respect of his dignity, gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in such matters as touch him; and the wife dooth the like in whatsoeuer is mee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e for her. But the man in taking the whole authority to himselfe, declineth to the Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garchie, doing against dignitie, that which is not best. Sometimes, the women that are the richer doe gouerne, but they doe not so in respect of their vertue, but by occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their wealth and power, as it happeneth in Oligarchies. The brethren dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> together, are like a Democratie, being equall amongst themselues, sauing in as much as they differ in age. But where the difference of ages is great, there is no more brotherly amitie and fellowship. The Democratie appeareth in such houses as are destitute of a lord and maister, wherein all are equall, and where the weakest ruleth, and euery one is at libertie to liue as he list.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> AS <hi>Amasis answered concerning the basin wherein he vsed to wash his feet.</hi>] Amasis as Herodotus writeth in the third booke of his Hystory, hauing ouerthrowne Apries in battaile, made himselfe king of AEgypt: but in the beginning of his raigne the AEgip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians made small account of him by reason hee had beene but a simple Cittizen, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> issued of a base house. After hee drewe them to like well of him, by the manner en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing. Amongst other his infinite mooueables, hee had a golden Tubbe wherein him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and they that resorted to his owne Table, had accustomed from day to day to wash their feete: hee caused this tubbe to be molten, and an Image to bee made of the same, which hee set vp in a fit and conuenient place of the Cittie, where it might best bee seene. The AEgyptians ranne thether straightway, and began to worship the Image with great honour and reuerence. Amasis being aduertised thereof, caused the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to bee called together, and then declared vnto them howe the Image was made of a Tubbe that was woont to serue to wash feete and to vomite and pisse in, and nowe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> was greatly worshipped and reuerenced by them. After hee saied vnto them, matters are so come to passe, that you haue behaued your selues towards mee, as toward the Tubbe: for though heretofore I were but of a meane calling, yet nowe I am your king: And therefore I purpose, that you shall yeeld mee all manner of honour, and haue mee in such respect as shall stand with reason.</p>

            <p>IN all matters that Aristotle taketh in hand to treate of, his custome is in the beginning, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearse what opinions other men haue had therein, who aforetime had spoken of the same to; the intent, after the examination thereof, to take what is good, &amp; refuse that is bad, as himselfe witnesseth in his first booke of the soule: because as Isocrates affirmeth in Euagoras, Arts and Sciences receiue their perfection, not by relying vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the sayings and opinions of men of former ages, of how great authoritie soeuer they were, but by correcting of the same, and chaunging in them whatsoeuer is found not to bee good. So for the more certaine dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couerie of the high secrets of nature, hee confuteth in his naturall and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall Philosophie, the errours of Democritus, Anaxagoras, Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docles, Anaximander, Thales, Melissus, Parmenides, and Heraclitus, being all excellent personages: And more, when occasion was offered, hath not spared his owne Maister Plato, of whome hee made so great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, Iudging (as himselfe affirmeth in the first booke of his Ethickes) the honour of truth whereunto hee had wholly vowed himselfe, worthie to bee preferred before all other duties and Offices. Likewise, at his begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to treat of the institution and gouernment of a Cittie or Common-weale, hee first setteth downe the most renowmed Common-weales of his time, as well those that were in vse, as the Candian, Lacedemonian, Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian, Carthaginian, and Milesian Common-weales; as those that were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of, as Platoes, both the first and second: finding in euerie of them somewhat requiring correction. Those Authours that had entreated or written of publicke gouernements, of whom Aristotle here maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are Socrates, Plato, Phaleas, Phidon, Hippodamus, Lycurgus, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos, Solon, Draco, Zaleucus, Charondas, Onomacrites, Philolas, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocles, Pittacus, and Androdamas.

For as Aristotle sheweth in the first Chapter of the fourth booke of this worke, The office of the Law-maker and true Gouernour is, to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> consider not onely which is simplie a good forme of Common-wealth, but also which is a good forme for them to whome hee giueth Lawes: which men call good by suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, that is to say, acording to the nature of the inhabitants, and regard had of their commodities.</p>

                  <p>NOVV <hi>let vs begin and enter on this discourse, in such sort as shall bee most conuenient for this consideration: It is necessary for Citizens to haue either all things, or none at all, in common: or else some common, and some not. That they should haue nothing in common, it is vnpossible; sith the Commonweale is a communitie, and that first of all the place where the Citty standeth
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:7218:47"/>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> must bee enioyned in common, there being but one place alleadged both for Cittie and Citti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, who are all parteners and fellow-sharers in the same: Neuerthelesse, it is doubtfull, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the good ordering and gouernement of a Citie, it be better, that as many thinges as are possible, should be had in common: or that some should be in common, and some not. For it may fall out, that Citizens among themselues will haue their children, wiues, goods, and possessions in common: as in Platoes Common-weale, where Socrates vpholdeth, that children, wiues, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> possessions should be in common.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>SITH the Cittie is some communitie, the question is, Whether all thinges therein <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> ought to be common, as they are limited to be in that forme of Commonwealth which Plato hath described, or only some: as streets, Market places, Hauls, Churches, Church-yards, and auditories or places appointed for the administration of Iustice; and the rest proper and priuate to euery man, according to the manner and course which hath ben receaued and allowed in all Countries, where they liue ciuilly and orderly.</p>
                  <p>IN <hi>Platoes Common-weale.</hi>] Forasmuch as Plato sawe mankinde continually encum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> with dissentions, and that they which in former ages had attempted to remedie it by innumerable Lawes, had done no good at all; but contrariwise, all waxed worse and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> worse: it seemed vnto him, that for the rooting out of all hatred and partialities amongst men, there was not a more readie and expedient way, than to present them with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munitie, not only of all goods and possessions, but also euen of the selfe-same thinges which Nature hath made proper and peculiar to euery man, as of the eies, ears, &amp; hands: as he writeth in the fift booke of his lawes: so that whatsoeuer a man saw, heard, or did, hee should employ it wholly to the vse and behoofe of all in common; insomuch, that for the better maintaining of mutuall loue among Cittizens, hee thought that euen wiues and children ought to bee common among them. Because that hauing nothing peculiar to themselues, they should by that meanes bee glad or sorrie all at once, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> as the case fel out or required: not that he thought it an easie thing to be brought to passe, but rather that it would be found very strange and wonderfull in respect of the noueltie thereof, sith it had not beene receiued or vsed afore vpon earth. Howbeit, that the perfect patterne of gouernement whereby he had shaped this his Common-weale in word, being peraduenture in heauen, was to bee seene onely of such as would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>oke vpon it earnestly with the eies of their vnderstanding, as hee himselfe affirmeth in the beginning of his fifth booke of the Common-weale, and about the end of the ninth booke, and in the preamble of Timeus. Many other learned men besides Aristotle haue reprooued this communitie, as Eusebius in the 12 Chapter of his 13 booke <hi>De prepar. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Euangel.</hi> Epiphanius in the 1. and 3. bookes of his second tome. Chrisostome in his first Homilie vpon Saint Matthew, and the second Chapter of the Actes of the Apostles. Lactantius in the 21 and 22 Chapters of his 3. booke. Saint Ambrose speaking of Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toes Commonweale and lawes, affirmetth that hee did not discribe a true Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth indeede, but one that was fained and deuised in his owne braine. Polibius in the sixt booke of his Hystory, reasoning about Common-weales, giueth this iudgement of Platoes: Peraduenture (sayeth hee) All the skill and reason of gouernement hath beene more cunningly and subtilly considered of and examined by Plato and other Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers touching the naturall conuersion and alteration of Common-weales: Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> their disputations are knowne and manifest to fewe, because they are debated with too great varietie of matter, and almost with too many wordes. Lower in the same booke he sayth: Further, except some practise of Platoes Common-weale were seene, it standeth with no reason, thus to compare it with such Common-weales as haue ben, or at this present are in vse and experience, as the Lacedemonian, the Carthaginian, and Romane Commonweales: for that w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Cato the yonger, his nature and conditions were not fit for a people, nor conuenient to procure him the loue and good will of a communaltie: Also hee came not in credite by flattering the people. Therefore Cicero sayeth of him: That through the demeaning of himselfe in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects, as though hee had liued in Platoes Cittie and Common-weale, and not vpon the lighes and grounds of that of Romulus, hee was repulsed and failed in obtaining the Consulship. Plutarch in the life of Cato, and also in his booke of the fortune of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander and of the Romanes, writeth as followeth concerning Platoes Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale: Plato when hee had ordained a forme of Common-weale, could persuade no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> man to receiue it, for that it was too seuere: But Alexander hauing builded aboue se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentie Citties amongst the barbarous people, and planted many great vines in Asia, procured them to leaue the rude and vnciuill life which they led before.

                     <hi>and the cause it selfe wherefore Socrates vpholdeth that a law to that effect should bee established, seemeth not to redound of his reasons. Againe if we looke vnto the end wherefore hee maintaineth that such order ought to be taken in a Citie or Common-weale, as is there disputed, it will bee found impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible. Also it is not there determined and set downe after what manner it should bee done and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> brought to passe, I meane how a Citie or Common-weale should be made one, as the greatest goods that can happen vnto it: For Socrates doth take that supposition, yet is it cleare, that by procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding further, and becomming more and more one, it will at length no longer be a Citie: for a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is a multitude consisting by Nature, and by drawing more &amp; more vnto vnitie, it wil become of a Citie a family, and of a family a man: and we call a house or family rather one, than a Citie or Common-weale: and a man rather one, than a house or family. Insomuch, that although that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> might be brought to passe, yet ought it not so to be, because it would destroy &amp; ouerthrow the City: for a City or Common-weale is not onely founded of many men, but also of such as differ in kind, and are not alike to each other.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>ARISTOTLE with foure reasons reprooueth that community propounded by So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates in Platoes Common-weale. The first reason is taken from the difficultie ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of that constitution: the second from the end that mooued Socrates to ordaine it, which is not reasonable: the third, that the contrary resulteth and redoundeth vpon So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates by his suppositions: the fourth, that it is altogether insufficient.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/>

SOCRA. Is there any more dangerous euill in a Cittie than that which deuideth it, and of one maketh many: or any thing better than that which knitteth it together, and doth make it one? GLAVC. None at all. SOCR. Dooth not the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of pleasure and sorrow vnite, when all the Citizens reioice or mourn for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> or departing of the selfe-same things? GLAVC. Yes verily. SOCR. The diuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of these things, doth dissolue it, when for the selfe-same accidents and chaunces of a Cittie and the Cittizens thereof, some persons greatly mourne, and other some reioice. GLAVC. Why not? SOCR. That commeth to passe, when these words are not published together, namely, Mine and Thine, and likewise other mens. GLAVC. It is so doubtlesse. SOCR. Therefore all those Citties are well gouerned, where many regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> one selfe-same thing, according to the selfe-same meanes, doe say, Mine, and not Mine. GLAVC. I graunt it. SOCR. And whatsoeuer Cittie or Common-weale is well affected and disposed, as a man: for when anie one of our fingers is hurt, the whole communion of the bodie, in regard of the soule, by the ordinance of that which ruleth therein, dooth feele it straightway, and mourneth altogether for that part which is hurt: And therefore wee say, a man hath a sore finger. The like reason is there in all other parts and passions of man, I meane as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning sorrowe, when anie part mourneth: and as touching pleasure, when anie part is delighted in it selfe. GLAVC. The reasons bee like. SOCR. And <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> touching your demaund, A Cittie gouerned, is verie like to this. For in mine opinion, as often as either good or harme chanceth to anie Cittizen or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moner, that Cittie shall out of hand call (his) the partie that shall bee in such case: and therefore, the whole Cittie shall either reioice or mourne. GLAVC. Of necessitie it must bee so in a Cittie gouerned by good Lawes. Aristotle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth this vniting of a Cittie, affirming it to bee contrarie to the Nature of a Cittie, for that the same should bee composed of manie persons, differing in sundrie respects, and not alike: and that by too much vniting of the same, it will continue no longer a Cittie, but by little and little <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The King of AEgypt sent to the Athenians, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring them to enter into league with him, and to send him aide for his deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie from the yoake and bondage of the Persians. The Athenians deeming that it was expedient for them to abate and weaken the power of the Persians to the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost of their power, and to binde the AEgyptians to them for remedie in such suddaine and vnexpected chaunces of Fortune as might fall vnto them, decreed in their Councell to aide the AEgyptians with three hundred Gallies. On the other side, the King of Persia sent certaine Embassadours with a great summe of money to Lacedemonia, requiring the Lacedemonians in his fauour <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to make Warre against the Athenians, in hope that they which ouer-matched his men in AEgypt, by that occasion should bee driuen to returne home to their owne houses to defend their natiue Countrey. <hi>Diod.

                  <p>FOR <hi>there is a difference betweene a league or confederacie in Warre, and a Cittie of peace: for a league is profitable in quantitie or multitude, though it consist of one and the selfe-same sort and kinde, and is naturally ordained for enterchangeable aid in the warres: Like as if the weight and number did drawe and carry away more. By the like reason a Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> dooth differ from a Nation, where men dwell not in streets and boroughes, but dispersed like <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the Arcadians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THERE bee three assemblies or societies of men, which are diuerse and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring one from another: namely, a Cittie, a League, and a Nation: A Cittie is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact of many men differing in their Vocations, degrees and Trades, assembled together in one place, and within the selfe-same wals, of purpose to liue commodiously and happily, as is affirmed in the first booke of this worke, the first Chapter: and in the fourth Booke, the second, third, and fourth Chapter: and in the sixt booke, the fourth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Chapter: and in the seuenth booke, the eight Chapter: and in his bookes of Houshold guuernment. A league is ordained to the end that many people confederated together, should helpe one another in their Warres, as is affirmed in the sixt Chapter of the third booke of gouernement: the which howe much the greater number of men it compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, so much the better and stronger it is, though they bee all of one estate and degree, as for example, all Martiall. And this is it that hee meaneth by saying, A league is profitable in quantitie or multitude, though it consist
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:7218:49"/>
of one and the selfesame sort and kinde, and is naturally ordained for enterchangeable <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> aid in the Warres: Like as if the weight did drawe and carrie away more, that is to say; that like as mettals and diuerse other kindes of Marchandises being weighed and tried in the ballance, are commonly the more they weigh, the more esteemed and set by: euen so in the league or martiall aide, the multitude of men is to bee considered; the which howe much the greater it is, so much the profitabler it is, without anie regard whether they bee all of one degree and calling, or not. Howbeit, the contrary thereof is to bee considered in the Citty, wherein diuerse vocations and exercises are to bee required. I find, that there bee two sorts of leagues: The one, where diuerse Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties confederated together, are not one aboue another in authoritie, and whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> and victories redound to the benefite of them all in common. The other, where one great Citty is confederated with other smaller Citties, but reserueth to her selfe the authoritie of ruling and commanding, together with the seat of the Empire, the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of all enterprises, and cheefe profite of all conquests and victories. The thirteene Citties of the Suissers allied together, and vsing a popular gouernement, being called Cantons, are to bee referred to the first sort of league: The which bee thus named ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the order of their sittings in their di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Againe, fiue of these thirteene, namely Vri, Scuuitz, Vuderwalden, Glaris, and Appentzel, are not Cities, but assemblies of people, where all men enioy equall libertie: and of these, specially of Vri, Scuuitz, and Vuderwalden, began the libertie of the Suissers, as Glarean alleadgeth in his Annotations vpon the first booke of Caesars Commentaries. It is supposed, that if all these thirteene Cantons did ioyne their forces together, they are able to arme a hundred thousand footemen, being excellent Pikemen, very skilfull in keeping or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and holding their rankes together, who will rather die in battaile then runne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> away: for they haue a Lawe that appointeth punishment of death, to all such as flee from the battaile. The men of Zuriche haue the cheefe place in common assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, in regard of the auncientnesse and Nobilitie of their Cittie, which afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time was an Earledome, as Munster affirmeth in the third booke of his Cosmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy: but the men of Berne are the richest and mightiest. They haue not in their confederacie any determined place for their assemblies and meetings, nor common Magistrates: but when any businesse ariseth concerning the Publicke State and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale, euery Canton sendeth his Deputies, who commonly meete and assemble at Baden, a very faire and rich Cittie, scituate wel-neere in the middest of the leagues:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> by occasion whereof, they hold in that Citty almost all their Parliaments or Counsels, wherein they consult of common and publicke affaires with equall libertie, sauing that they of Zuriche are the first, as is afore alleadged. Whatsoeuer is there resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and agreed vpon, is followed and ratified by all the Cantons. These thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene Cantons haue certaine confederates common to them all: and some of them particularly haue their proper and peculiar confederates. Also they haue subiects in common, ouer whome they haue all of them gouernement by order and course: one fort is gouerned by one Canton or moe. The Rhetians or Grisans are their allies, consisting of three leagues gouerned by Communalties, whose Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> is partlie high Dutch, and partlie of the Lumbard tongue. Also the Valesians and Geneuans, are their confederates. Further, the Swissers are in league with the Kingdome of Fraunce, which is renued at euerie newe Kinges comming to the Crowne, and haue also another league, which they call Hereditarie, with the House of Burgundie and Austryche. In time past, there were twelue Citties of the Tuscanes, thus confederated in Hetruria:

In like sort were there in the lesser Asia, now called Anatolia, and in certaine Islands of the sea neere thereto, twelue Citties of the Ionians confederated together: namely, Milet, Mys, Pydne, Ephesus, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lophon, Abide, Teos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Also the AEoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> league consisted of these twelue Cities; Cymes, Clarisses, Neouthicos, Tenus, Cille, Notion, Egiroesse, Pitaue, Egea, Myrine, and Grinie: the twelfth was Smyrna, which was taken from them by the Ionians. All the which twelue Citties stoode in the firme Land, and in a farre better Countrey than the Ionians Country, though the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of the yeare were not so temperate there, as the same Herodotus writeth in the same booke. Moreouer, there were in Peloponesus, now called Morea, twelue Citties of the Achaians confederated together; namely, Palena, Egira, Eges, Bura, Elice, Egion, Rapes, Patres, Phares, Olena, Drima, and the Triteas, which alone are Midlandish, as the same Authour sayth in the same first booke.

Plutarke in the life of Aratus, who was Gouernour of the Achaians, writeth thus of their league: Thus (sayeth he) did these Citties which were euery one by themselues seuerally weake, preserue one another by being knit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by the chaine of the Common-wealth. Like as in the bodies of liuing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the parts doe liue, nourish themselues, and take spirit of life by the mutuall linking and bond which they haue one with another: and as soone as there chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> any separation amongst them, they take no more sustenance, but marre and putrifie: so these Citties perished by meanes of them that broke their societie: And contrariwise, prospered when they tasted of the common prouidence, by making themselues members one of anothers corporation. These leagues for ought that can bee found out within the compasse of anie memorie, did scarsely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede twelue or thirteene Citties. For when they attaine to such number, as that they are able to defend themselues, they seeke no further to bee augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: as well for that necessitie dooth not driue them to seeke more power, as also for that by reason their conquests are common vnto them all, they make <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> not so great account of them: and also for that by encreasing in societies and confederacies, the multitude thereof might growe vnto some confusion. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when they perceiue themselues to bee as many in number as will suffice for their liuing in safetie, then doe they bend themselues to two things, the one either to receiue other people into their protection, and by that means to get mony or some other profit that is easie to be parted amongst the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as the Swissers doe of the inhabitants of the free country of Burgundy: the other, to take mercenary armes, &amp; fight in the pay

A Nation which is not distributed into castles and boroughes, but dispersed in Hamlets here and there in the fieldes, and hauing onely certaine Magistrates in common, dooth differ from a Cittie by the like difference, that is to say,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> in multitude, as a Cittie is properly taken: for nowe and then such a Nation is called a Cittie by some Authours, as for example, by Iulius Caesar in his first Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie of the French Warres: Where speaking of the Cittie of Heluetia, hee sayeth it is deuided into foure Cantons.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> commonly doe men thinke there is a Cittie properly, when it hath there within a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient companie of Inhabitants: Wherefore, if the most sufficient is most to bee wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed: then is that which is least one, to bee preferred before that which is most one.</hi>

                  <p>HE prooueth here by another reason, that there may bee no such vnion in a Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie as Socrates hath set downe, because a Cittie dooth necessarily consist of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders and obeyers enterchangeably, and of others differing in sundry respects: as Gentlemen, Commoners, Poore, Rich, Crafts-men, Marchants, Laborers, and Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> who sufficiently bewray that varietie and diuersitie bee very necessary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, which notwithstanding are contrarie to that manner of vnion. For as naturall thinges are made of elements, and a familie of thinges differing in sundry respects: so ought a Cittie to bee composed of diuerse kinds and orders of men. Howbeit, there is no doubt, but that it is maintained by vnitie and good agreement, and ouerthrowne by dissention and discord.</p>

So to the end the Common-weale may remaine in safety, there ought not any one part of the same growe stronger than the rest: but it behooueth that all, if it were possible, should haue part in the publicke authority and power. Therfore in dominions &amp; Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weales, where lords and Cittizens are all equall, the distributing of honours and Magistrateships ought to be obserued in such sort, that all may beare rule by turnes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly as their turne shall fall, some three yeares, other some one yeare, and others eight months, as the Venetian Gentlemen doe, who haue the whole gouernement and power of the Common-weale reserued to them and their Counsell, so as no Magistrate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> of himselfe hath any authority of importance, neither is perpetuall, sauing the Duke, who continueth during his life, and Saint Markes proctors, who haue no prefixed time, but continue in those roomes till their deaths.</p>

Therefore it would not bee amisse, if all men should call the selfesame thing their owne, in one sence of All, that is, distributiuely: But that is not possible, &amp; being vnderstood in the other, to wit, collectiuely; it is in all respects vnfit to breed concord. Further, that discourse of Socrates containeth another in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience: for men smally regard any thing that is common to many, but make good account of that which euery man hath particuler to himselfe. And if some one man bee carefull of that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> which is in common, other men therefore will make smaller account and care of it: as it falleth out in houshold affaires, where often many seruants do worse seruice than a fewer number. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as then by that way propounded by Socrates, euery Citizen may haue a thousand sonnes, which shall not be proper to himselfe, but common to euery other man, all men will indifferently neglect them<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> By the same meane also euery Citizen will call any person in the Citie his, that doth well or euill, how many soeuer they be: as for example, This is my sonne, or this is his sonne, and speake in like sort of euery one of a thousand Citizens, or howe many soeuer a City dooth containe: and that doubtfully, because it is not certaine who is the childs father, and for whome it is brought vp. But whether is it better for euery man so to cal (his) any one of two thousand or ten thousand, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> or rather as men at this day in Cities, say this is mine, where one selfesame party is called by one man his sonne, by another his brother, by another his nephew, or by some ether name of kindred, or of Parentage, alliance, or affinity, of himselfe first, and next of those that be his: and further, by one fellow or brother of a fraternity, by another companion of the selfe-same Tribe? It is a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> great deale better to be a right and proper nephew, than the other way a sonne. Neither can this possibly be auoided in that communitie, but that some men will rest doubtfull, who be their owne brethren, children, fathers and mothers: for by the likenesse of children to their parents, they
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:7218:52"/>
must necessarily make triall one of another, as diuerse Cosmographers doe affirme to bee vsed in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4.5"/> certaine countries of the higher Affrica, where women are common, and that children are there discerned by their likenesses and shapes. Also of beasts, there be diuerse females found, as Mares and kine, that bring forth yoeng ones, like their dammes: as for example, the Mare of Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salia, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> which therefore was tearmed iust. Againe, it is not possible for the setters downe of that community to auoid diuerse inconueniences: as for example, affraies and slaughters made sometimes wilfull, and sometime against wil: and also riots, brauling, and quarrelling, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting whereof against father and mother, and other neere kinsfolke, is worse and more intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, than if they were done against strangers: which kinds of wickednesse will of necessitie soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> happen where kindred is vnknown, then when it is knowne.

Also the pretenders to make children common, do commit a great absurdity, in that they only forbid the mutual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of louers, and prohibite not loue it self: and such other fashions as are most vnseemely to passe betweene father and son, and brother and brother: considering that such manner of loue is of it selfe dishonest, and that it is impertinent and to no purpose to enioine them from that kind of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, for no other reason, then onely for that there is too great pleasure therein: without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard had whether they be father or son, or brethren and sisters among themselues. It seemeth that the communitie of wiues and children is more meet to be established amongst husbandmen, than <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> keepers and gouernors of Cities &amp; Common-weales: because the community of children &amp; wiues <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> would breed the lesse friendship amongst them: and subiects ought to bee kept in such tearmes, as that they may be holden vnder obedience, and not seeke after nouelties. Doubtlesse, that law of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates would worke, not only quite contrary to that which all laws duly ordained, should perform, but also directly against that cause which moued Socrates to hold opinion, that such order should <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> be taken concerning children and wiues: for wee iudge, that amity and friendship is the greatest of all goods and commodities that any City or Common-weale can attaine and come vnto, &amp; the most apt thing to defend them from sedition and vprores. And Socrates dooth highly extoll the vniting of a City, which in his opinion seemeth to be the worke of friendship, as we know how A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristophanes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> in the dialogue or treatise of loue setteth downe, that louers through the feruent loue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> they beare one to another, do come together, and of two make themselues one, but that is fondnes: for by making one of two, of necessity either both or one of them must perish. Wherfore, that kind of community proposed by Socrates, wil much diminish friendship in a City and Common-weale, and bring to passe, that no son can certainly say this is my father; nor any father, this is my sonne. But admit old men should call the yonger sort sonnes, and yong men should tearme the elder sort <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> fathers, yet would that serue to little purpose: for as a small quantity of sweetnesse mingled with a great deale of water, maketh a strange and insensible mixture, euen after the selfesame sort doth it fall out, in that kindred and familiarity, which springeth from such manner of names and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> tearmes: so as in that kind of Common-weale, it is not necessary either for the Father to haue care of his sonnes, or the sonnes of the father, nor for brethren to take care one of another. Soothly, there bee two things which greatly mooue men to care and loue: Namely, that commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie which is euery mans owne and proper to himselfe, and affection or good will, neither of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> which can bee amongst men subiect to such kind of gouernement. Againe, the transporting of children from husbandmen and artificers to keepers, and from keepers to husbandmen and craf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

By which meanes, will the inconueniences afore touched, the soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> happen: namely, murders, vnlawfull louings, and man-slaughters. For neither such persons as are transferred and conueied to other Cittizens, doe any longer call their keepers, brethren and sonnes, fathers and mothers: nor likewise, they that abide with keepers, do vse those names to others to whom they are put ouer, whereby the reuerence or regard of kindred, should restraine them from committing such enormities.

Notwithstanding, the opinion of Plato in the fift book of his Common-weale, as appeareth by his reasoning, there at large set downe, and by his repetition of the same Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-weale in the beginning of his <hi>Timeus,</hi> was not, that women should be absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon, prostitute to the company of all men without difference, &amp; so by means ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> children should be in a maner illegitimate and incestuous bastards, a thing reproued by all laws both of God and men: But for the clear rooting out of the apprehension and conceit of [mine, and not mine] out of mens minds, because they are the occasions of all sutes, partialities, and seditions; hee pretended, that yoong virgines when they were of age to marry, should by certaine Magistrates thereunto authorised, be matched in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to yoong men of their owne complexion and quality, with certaine ceremonies; lots, and songs, that is to say, good maids to good men, and strong maids to strong men, the more conueniently to bring forth children like themselues: &amp; that when they were with child, they should be retired a part from their husbands, and bee well kept and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> else-where till the time of their deliueries. And that then the children which came of those marriages should be noursed and brought vp togither in one meet place at the charge of the Common-weale: so that yong folk of like age, hauing ben brought vp after one fashion, should account themselues for the Common-weales children, and for brethren, and acknowledge the eldest sort for their fathers and grandfathers. This he thought was meet to bee obserued in the children of the keepers, and all such as in time to come should bee keepers, that is to say, Magistrates and men of warre. Plato straineth himselfe to shewe howe that fashion is not onely possible, but also very good and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoofefull.

Now Socrates imagined that hee had stablished vnitie in a Cittie, when all men might say of one selfesame woman, child, or house, This is mine, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and that is not mine: Which were well said, taking the word All for euery one, that is to say, by way of distribution, where euery man speaketh of any thing that particularly belongeth to himselfe: but when it is taken by way of collection, it is both impossible and absurd, that all men together speaking of one selfe-same thing that is common, should say, This is mine, and this is not mine: and besides the vnitie intended by Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes could not follow of it.</p>

But that manner and course which is now vsed, being stablished and adorned with good customes and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right lawes, will bee more conuenient, for that it hath both the commodities: retaining as well <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> that benefite which may come by the community of possessions, as that which may growe by the proprietie of them. It is expedient that possessions be inioyed in proprietie, and yet common after a certaine manner. For where they be proper, the labours and cares that are distributed, bee not anie occasion that one man should quarrell with another: nay, rather they doe much good, in that all men doe continually applie themselues seuerally about that which is their owne in seueraltie: Howbeit, for vertues sake they will according to the Prouerbe, make the vse of commodities com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon amongst friends. That fashion of liuing, to the end it should not be iudged to bee vnpossible, is already represented in diuerse Cities, specially in those that be wel gouerned: some of the which haue receiued this fashion, and the rest may receiue it. For euery man that hath any possession <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> proper to himselfe, dooth yeeld certaine commodities to the benefite of his friends, and vseth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse other commodities as common, according to the custome of the Lacedemonians, who vse as their owne one anothers Slaues, Horses, Dogges, and victuals, if they stand in need of the same when they trauaile into the country or fields. Therefore it appeareth, that it is best that possessions should remaine perticuler, and yet be made common by the vse and bestowing of them: but howe that may be brought to passe, it is the Lawmakers work and office to prouide in that behalfe. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, the pleasure cannot bee expressed that men conceiue in thinking that they haue some <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> goods proper to themselues. For that friendship which euery man beareth to himselfe, is not vain but naturall. And though selfe-loue be found fault withall, the meaning is not that a man should <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> not loue himselfe at all, but no more than is expedient: and in like manner concerning the loue of money, sith all men loue such commodities. Also it is a great contentation and pleasure to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie and helpe friends, strangers, and such as bee of our acquaintance, as they may very well doe, that are owners of any goods or possessions in priuate: which thing can neuer befall to them that vnite a Citie too much, who also besides in so doing, lose all exercise of two vertues: First of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance and Abstinence from women; for it is a goodly work to abstaine from other mens wiues through the gift of temperatenesse: and next, of Liberality, which consisteth in the employing &amp; bestowing of goods: For no man can be accounted liberall, vnlesse he haue goods of his owne to distribute, as his office requireth.

For a house and Citie must each of them bee one after a certaine sort, but not wholly: For a Citie may growe so farre into one, that it can bee no longer a Citie: or if it shall drawe to the point of lacking but a little of being no Citie, it will bee worse, like as if a tune were brought to one note, or a verse to one foote.

Insomuch, that a man shall finde nothing well ordered in that Commonweale: sauing that the Gouernours are not put to the tillage of the ground, as the Lacedemonians doe alreadie begin to practise. Notwithstanding, Socrates hath not specified at all, what forme of Commonweale and gouernement should bee assigned to them that liue in common, neither is it an easie matter to set downe. Though the multitude of a Citie dooth almost consist of diuerse Citizens and Townes-men, yet dooth bee determine nothing for them: to wit, whether Husbandmen ought to haue their possessions in common, or euerie man his owne in particular: nor whether their wiues and children should bee in proprietie or communitie.

Further, Socrates his manner of ordeining and stablishing of Magistrates, is dangerous, in that hee keepeth the selfesame men alwaies in office and authority: which is an occasion, that they who come to no promotion and dignitie, and others who are stout and warlike fellowes, fall vnto mutinies and seditions. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> Socrates by meanes of his owne supposion is constrained so to appoint: For that golde is not mingled by Gods grace, one while in one mind, and another while in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but alwaies in the selfesame.

And bereauing the rulers of all felicitie, hee vpholdeth, that the Lawmaker ought to make the whole Citie happie.

                  <hi>NOw for asmuch as the like imperfection is neare band found in the lawes described by him afterward, it shall not be amisse to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider a little of that forme of Common-wealth also: For Socrates in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> his first Common-wealth hath but sleightly touched a fewe thinges, to wit, the community of women and children, howe it ought to bee, and the communitie of goods together with the ordering of a Common-wealth. He deuided the whole multitude of inhabitants into two parts, namely Husbandmen and men of Armes, of which hee compoundeth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> a third, which consulteth and exerciseth authority in the City. As touching Husbandmen and Artificers, whether they are to bee receiued into any Office, or whether they may beare Armes, or goe on warfare or no, Socrates hath not a whit determined: but hee esteemed that women ought to goe on warfare, and bee partakers of the same discipline and institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as men in authority are. As concerning the booke of Lawes, the greatest part <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> thereof is touching Lawes, and little or nothing touching Pollicy or Gouernement: the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> which also studying to make common to other Citties, by litile and little hee falleth againe into another forme of Common-wealth: For (except onely the communitie of Wiues and goods) hee ascribeth the selfe-same thinges to both kindes, setting foorth the same Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the same exemption from necessarie businesses, and the same manner of eating to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> except that here hee addeth the assemblie of women to that same end: and in the one hee would haue a thousand men at Armes, and in the other fiue thousand: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> the whole speech of Socrates carries indeede a shew of brauerie, but is superfluous, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> vaine-glorious, and full of nouelty and doubtfull questions: and peraduenture it is a hard matter, that all should goe well therein, especially in regard of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude whereof wee spake of late; which being so great, surely there would want necessaries, as in the land of Babylon, or any other ample and large Countrey, to furnish with victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> so many idle men as fiue thousand, with a farre greater companie of women and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Let him therefore deuise suppositions in his braine, so that they bee such as are not impossible. Moreouer, hee sayeth: That a Law-giuer when hee maketh Lawes, ought to haue regard to these two thinges, to the place and to the men: to the which, it will not be amisse to adde the regard of neighbour adioyning places, to the end, the Citie may haue a politicke kinde of life: for it is necessarie that it bee prouided of Weapons and Armes that are profitable, not onely for it selfe, but also which may serue for another Countrie. And put the case then, that such a life of the City is not approoued neither
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:7218:57"/>
in particular nor in publicke: yet notwithstanding the Cittizens ought to bee fearefull to their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> enemies, not onely when they i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Besides, regard ought to bee had to possessions, whether the quantitie of them might not bee bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that is to say, more plainely and manifestly defined and set downe: for hee affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that there ought to bee so much goods in this Cittie, as might suffice euery one to l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>e temperately, as if hee would say, to liue well: which is too generall a speech, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that a man may liue temperately, and yet notwithstanding miserably. Wherefore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> it were better to say, Temperately, and Liberally together: both which seperately taken, a lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urious life dooth follow the one, and a laborious the other, considering that these vertuous habites doe onely consist in the vse of goods: for wee are not accustomed to say that a man <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> dooth vse goods gently or valiantly, but moderately and liberally: so that it is necessary, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> that the vse of them consist in that. Further, it is impertinent and absurd, when as hee bringeth in an equalitie of goods and possessions, to determine nothing concerning the multitude of Cittizens, and to leaue at large the measure of procreation of children: as if it would necessarily come to passe, that howe many soeuer were borne, yet there would bee a sufficient equalitie by reason of the barrennesse of some, as wee see it happen at this present in Citties. But neuerthelesse, that could not bee so exactly obserued then, as now; the reason is, because nowe adaies none are poore, by reason that the goods and possessions are destributed among the multitude: but then they being not distributed, necessarilie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> such persons as exceede the rated number, or bee extraordinarie, must haue nothing whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were more or fewe in number: and therefore it were more needefull rather to limite the generation of children, then the quantitie of possessions: that men might not beget more children then was ordained and prescribed. And in this limitation of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren regard must bee had to the diuerse chaunces of death, and to the barrennesse of men and women: for that being not regarded, as wee see in many places, is the cause that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> Cittizens become poore, and then pouertie engendreth sedition and wickednesse. Phidon the Corinthian one of the most ancient Law-giuers in memorie of man, was of this minde, that the number of houses and of Cittizens ought alwaies to be equall: albeit, at the first <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> vnequall proportions had by lot fallen vnto all; but the contrarie is to bee found in these Lawes: of which matter wee will entreate hereafter, and declare what wee thinke is fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> to bee ordained. Furthermore, hee hath omitted to shewe howe Magistrates and they which are in authoritie, differ from priuate men. For hee sayth, onely as the Warpe is made of another kind of thread then the Wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e, so ought Magistrates to differ from subiects. Againe, whereas hee permitteth the encrease and multiplication of possessions vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fiue folde: wherefore dooth hee not allowe the same in lands and territories vnto a certaine limitation? Also the deuision of houses which hee maketh, is not very commodious nor fit for houshold affaires: for hee assigneth to euery man two distinct seuerall houses, but it is a hard <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> matter for one man to inhabite two houses. Besides all this, all the whole discription of his Common-wealth seemeth neither to bee a popular power, which they call a Democratie, nor the power of a fewe, called an Oligarchie: but a forme of gouernement betwixt both, which they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> call a Policie, consisting of men that beare Armour. If therefore hee hath propounded this forme of Common-wealth, as the most vsuall in Cities; it may bee hee hath sayed well: but if as the best next vnto the first, hee is out of the way: for so the Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an forme, or some other, where the best men Aristocratically beare rule, is more commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> Some are of opinion, that a good Common-weale ought to bee compounded of all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ormes of gouernement together: and in that respect they commend the Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> because it consisteth of an Oligarchie, a Monarchie, and a Democratie, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> is, the dominion of the people: Their Kingly State is a Monarchie, their Senate an <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> Oligarchie, and their Ephorie a Democratie: because the Magistrates or Tribunes of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> the people called Ephori, are taken out of the people. Others thinke, that this Ephorian Office is a plaine Tyrannie, and that Democratie consisteth rather in their common assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, and ioint banquettings, and their other ordinarie manners of life. And more
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:7218:57"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> in these laws of Socrates it is declared, that a good Common-wealth must be compounded of these two formes, a Democratie and a Tyrannie: which are either no formes at all of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or if they bee, yet are they the worst of all. Therefore they that mingle more formes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, are rather to bee followed, because a Common-wealth compact of the most formes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> of gouernement, is the best. And yet if a man would consider Socrates Common-wealth aduisedly, hee shall finde little or nothing therein that belongs to a Monarchie, but all to an Oligarchie or a Democratie, although it encline naturally most to an Oligarchie, as it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by the creation of Magistrates: for to create them being elect by lot, is common to both: but to bee necessarie that the most rich bee assistant and present at their publike consultations, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and the creation of Magistrates, and the execution of other ciuill offices, whereas the rest are exempted therefrom, is proper to an Oligarchie: As this also, to procure that the greatest <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/> part of those that beare rule in the Common-wealth bee of the richer sort; and that the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Offices bee put on them that haue greatest riches. Also the election of the Senate is Oligar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chicall:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22"/> for all chuse necessarily, but the first choice is out of them of the first ranke of men of greatest reuenue, then as many out of the second, and so of the third: except that they of the third &amp; fourth ranke are not necessarily to chuse: as for the fourth, only they of the first &amp; second ranke of reuenue, in all the four are constrained to chuse them. Then he saith after this, that they must cull out of each ranke so many, that they all may be of an equall number: so that they of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> greatest reuenue must exceede in number and goodnesse, for asmuch as there are some of the popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacie that chuse not at all, and that because they are not compelled to chuse. Therefore that this Common-wealth cannot consist of a Democratie and a Monarchie, it is cleare by this that hath beene spoken, and will be more cleare by that which we shall speake hereafter, when occasion shall be offered. Also there ariseth a danger in that maner of creation of Magistrates, in chusing some out of them that be chosen: For if certaine should conspire together, though they were but a few, yet would the election be compassed by vndermining, according to their owne desires. And this is that forme of Common-wealth which Plato in his lawes hath described.</hi>

Nowe fetching a comparison from the Weauer, who maketh not the Woue and the Warpe of like yearne, but putteth the strongest in the Warpe, and the slendrest in the Woue, that it may be the apter for workemanship: hee sayeth that after the like sort, they which shall bee Magistrates, ought to bee discerned from others, that there may be authority on the one side, and obedience on the other, as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> appeareth in the fift booke <hi>De Legib.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>FVRTHER <hi>the whole forme of this State seemeth neither a popular gouernement, nor the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> authority and power of a few, but a meane betweene both, called a Common-weale.</hi>] Euery Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is gouerned by one or many: if by one, it is called a Monarchie: if by many, a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale. Againe, where it is gouerned by one, either that one doth all alone after his owne pleasure, or els vseth good mens counsell and exercise: if he doe all alone, it is ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie: if with others, a kingdome. Further, euery Cittie is gouerned by one, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, or a few folke, and that either well or euill: if well by one, it is a kingdome: if euill, a tyrannie: if by a few men well, an Aristocratie: if euill, an Oligarchie: if by many well, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> a mixed Common-weale: if euill, a Democratie. Plato at the end of the fourth booke of his Common-weale, setteth downe fiue sorts of Common-weales, the kingly state, an Aristocratie, an Oligarchie, a Democratie, and a Tyrannie. In his Politickes or Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of reigning, he assigneth three good, and three bad, affirming, that the kingly state is the best. In his fift booke of Lawes he sayth how that is the best Common-weale where all things are common, which he calleth the first: and the second, that which he descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth in the said Lawes which is mixed with the Democratie and Oligarchie. Therefore Plato and Aristotle doe differ in this, that Plato mingleth the Oligarchie with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocratie: Aristotle doth seperate them, and maketh one seuerall kind, which he calleth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> a Common-weale that is mixed: but they agree in some sort in the mixture of these formes. For tyranny by it selfe is not good, neither an absolute Kingdome, nor a Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratie, not an Oligarchie: but for the attainement of a iust and good Common-weale, they must bee all mingled together, and thereof one compounded forme made and established.</p>
               <p>IF <hi>then he haue pretended this forme of Common-weale, as that which is most common to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> Cities.</hi>] Which may be conuenient or applied to moe Citties than the first, as not the furthest from mens common custome and manner of liuing.</p>
               <p>SOME <hi>hold opinion, that a good Common-weale should be mingled of all sorts.</hi>] Euery sort <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> of Common-weale established alone and singly by it selfe, doth quickly goe out of kind into his next vice, except it be guided and holden together by the others. As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the kingly state: though it be the best of all resembling the diuinity, wherein all men acknowledge that one God onely doth rule and gouerne, yet by means of mans vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant mind, being easily marred in so high power and liberty, it quickly chaungeth into Tyrannie. So the Aristocratie, that is to say, the signiorie or state, wherein the wisest and honest personages ought to gouerne, doth conuert into the Oligarchie: When diuerse
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:7218:59"/>
of the mightiest men conspiring together, do take vpon them the managing of all pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> affaires, and dispose of all matters of state according to their owne pleasures. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, the Democratie wherein the common people gouerne modestly by the auncient law and custome of the Countrey, doth swell into a disorder of egalnesse and libertie: where euery one pretendeth to haue authoritie to doe and say what he list. Therefore a Common-weale founded to haue long continuance, ought not to be single, nor of one kind alone, but must haue all the vertues and proprieties of the others assembled into it, to the end, that no disproportionablenesse take root and encrease therein, which may cause it to goe out of kind to the next vice to it, and so destroy and ouerthrow it.

               <p>The Lacedemonian Common-weale, mingled therein these three kinds of States, so aptly that it continued about seuen hundred yeares after one manner, alwaies keeping the integritie and perfection of the first institution thereof: Wherein the kings, the Ephores, and the Senat, had their preheminences and authorities so entermingled and ballanced together, that it could not wel be discerned vnder what kind of gouernment it was stablished.</p>
               <p>The Common-weale of Carthage was thus ordained at the beginning: It had kings, and the Aristocratical power of Senators, and the Communaltie, which had also their prerogatiue in matters that concerned them: so that as farre as toucheth the assembling <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> of the three estates, it was like the Lacedemonian.</p>
               <p>The Commonweale of Rome had these three parts so euenly and fitly entermixed that a man cannot tell whether it were all an Aristocratie, or a Democraty, or a Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie: if one consider the power and authority of the Consuls, hee might iudge it for a Monarchie and kingly estate: and hauing an eye to the Senators, he might deeme it for an Aristocratie: or a popular Democratie.</p>
               <p>The Venetians establishing their Commonweale, haue so ordered the three estates, that it setteth our the kingly dominion, the gouernement of Aristocratie, and the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the people. Their high or great Counsell hauing the soueraigne authoritie,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> whereupon the Senate and the authoritie of all the Magistrates dependeth, doth repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the popular state.

               <p>Forasmuch as in the kingdome of Fraunce, the Possessions, Honours, and Offices of the Commonweale are deuided and parted amongst all the Estates proportionablie vnto their degrees, and euery of them kept in his preheminence and calling, there en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sueth of the same such a consent and agreement, as hath beene the occasion of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> and prosperity thereof by so long tract of time amongst all kingdomes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there is any remembrance or knowledge: for taking it aright, it partaketh of the three States. First it hath a King, who is a Monarke, loued, obeyed, and feared with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all: Who though hee haue full power and authoritie to command and doe what he list, yet is this high and Soueraigne libertie ruled and limitted by good Lawes and Ordinances, and by the great multitude and authoritie of Officers which are so neere about his person, that in sundrie places of the Realme, scant can the king doe anie thing, that should bee either too violent or too preiudiciall to his subiects. The twelue Peeres, the secret and priuie Counsels, the Parliaments and great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> Councell, the Chambers of Accounts, the Treasuries and Generalities of char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges are pertaining to the Aristocratie. The Estates holden euerie yeere in the Prouinces, the Mairalties of Townes, Shrieualties, Consulships, Chapterships, Wardens and keepers of Townes, are Democraticall: as appeareth in Siessel his French Monarchie, and in the preface of Appian of Alexandria, by him translated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to French.</p>

               <p>THE <hi>Senate, the Oligarchie, and the Ephori or Tribunes, the Democratie, for that the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> Magistrates or Tribunes of the people called Ephori, are created by the people.</hi>] Aristotle in the fourth booke of his Politickes, cap. 9. hath these words: Many men vphold, that the Commonweale of the Lacedemonians is a Democratie, because their institution hath <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> many things of the Democratie: as for example, First, the training vp of children, sith the rich mens children are brought vp as the poore mens, and instructed and trained in the selfe-same sort the poore bee. Also in their ages ensuing, and when they come to mans estate, they liue after the same order: For the rich are no more made of there, than the poore: They are serued in publicke feasts with one kind of meate: and the rich weare such apparrell as the poorest sort may come by. Againe, for that the two highest Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates are in the handes of the people: whereof they chuse one, and haue part in the other, sith they chuse the Senatours, and haue part in the Ephorie. Others affirme howe it is an Oligarchie, because it hath diuerse thinges of the Oligarchie, as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> all the Magistrates by election, and none by lots: and for that a few haue power to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne to death, or to bannish, and diuerse other like matters.</p>
               <p>OTHERS <hi>are of opinion, that the Tribuneship or Ephorian authoritie, is tyrannie.</hi>] Plato <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> in his fourth booke <hi>De Legibus</hi> sayth: When I consider the Lacedemonian Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale, I cannot well tell how I should call it: for the power of the Magistrates there cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Ephores, is Tyrannicall. Sometimes it seemeth aboue all other Citties, most like the Democratie. Nowe, it were altogether impertinent to denie, that it is no Aristocratie: also that the kingdome which is perpetuall therein, is as well by others, as by our selues deemed the ancientest of all others. Therefore being thus vpon the sodaine asked the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> question (as I saied) I cannot presently answere you distinctly, which of these Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weals the Lacedemonian is.

For it most often falleth out, that men of very base and meane calling attaine to great richesse, insomuch, that for the gathering of richesse, and increasing their substance by the gaine of their meane exercises and vile occupations, they spare not themselues, but beguile their owne nature, as well in victuals, as in taking their rest: to the end, to rake the more wealth together. On the contrarie side, some that be well borne, and haue ben brought <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> vp Gentlemen-like, fall into pouertie, either by misfortune, as often as it chanceth, or els by meanes they giue themselues to learning and vertue, and take no care for getting of richesse. Therefore those manner of persons who tast of nothing but co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetousnesse, and are destitute of good learning, by little and little lay hold on the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement.

               <p>
                  <hi>THere haue bene other formes of Commonweales brought in, some by men of no learning, others by Philosophers, and men of experience in Gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. All the which formes draw neerer than the two former afore spoken of, to those that in time past haue bene established, and to such also as are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> in vse and practise in this age. For there hath not any other man inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the like noueltie concerning the communitie of wiues and children, nor touching the assemblie and meeting of women at meat and meales: But rather they begin with those things that are necessarie, diuers of them holding opinion that the cheefe and principall point lyeth in ordering goods and possessions aright, from whence they say all ciuile discord and dissention ariseth. Vpon which occasion, Phaleas the Calcedonian hath first set foorth this consideration, vpholding that the goods and possessions of Citizens oughte to be equall: supposing it no hard matter to make them equall, if it be foreseene and prouided for at the first stablishing of a Citie: howbeit a hard matter to be brought to passe after a citie is alreadie founded, and yet withall a thing that may be done, so that rich men giue dowries and portions in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> mariage with their daughters and receaue none themselues: and that on the contrary side, the poore doe take them and giue none. Plato writing his Lawes, allowed the augmentation of posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions vnto a certaine stint and limitation, howbeit in such sort, that it was not lawfull for any Citizen of what state degree or condition soeuer he were, to possesse aboue fourefold as much as the smallest possession of the meanest sort amounted vnto, as hath bene in this worke already decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Againe, the ordainers of those Lawes ought not to be ignorant of one thing, wherevnto they haue no regard at this day, namely, that when they ordaine and limit the greatnesse of pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions, it were also expedient to prescribe and make a law for the stinting of the number of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: For if the number and multitude of children surmount the greatnesse of the reuennues <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and possessions, the Law must needs be dissolued and abrogated: and besides that abrogation, will rise vp an inconuenience, in that many shall of Rich become poore, whome it will bee hard to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>epe from attempting some nouelties and alterations. That therefore the equalnesse of posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions is of some effect in a ciuile societie, some men of old time seeme to haue had vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: as for example, Solon made a law in that behalfe, and likewise other lawmakers haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and ordayned lawes that forbid the possessing of so much land as euery man list. In like <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> fort the lawes forbid the sale of goods and possessions, as there is a statute in Locres restrayning the sale of patrimonies, without euident proofe of some misfortune happened: and commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the preseruation of auntient inheritaunces. The neglecting of which ordinance in Leu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cades,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> made their Commonweale too popular: because, that according to the stint of their reuenues, they came no more to the Magistrateships. But there may bee an equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of possessions, yet will it bee such, as that either they will bee in too great plentie and abundance; and so the cause of lauishnesse and riotous liuing: or else so scarce and so little, that there will bee great want and scarcitie. Therefore a Law-maker dooth not deale sufficiently in making possessions equall, except hee reduce them to a mediocrity: and yet the reducing of them to a mediocrity, will not doe any good, vnlesse the greedy desires of men bee rather made equall and limitted, than possessions: which is vnpossible to bee brought to passe, if the Citizens be not sufficiently trained and ordered by lawes. But it may <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> bee that Phaleas would answere, that hee pretended to declare, that in Citties there ought to bee equality of these two things: namely of possessions, and of discipline and instruction. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, hee ought to haue told vs what manner of discipline and instruction this should bee: which can doe no good if it bee one and the selfesame. For it may bee one and the same, and yet such as may make men ouer-couetous of money and honour, or of both together. Further, seditions doe happen by reason of the inequality, not onely of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:7218:61"/>
goods, but also of honours: howbeit, after a diuerse and contrary manner about both of them.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> for the common people doth become malecontent with the vnequalnesse of goods: and men of reputation conceiue displeasure at equality of honours: whence came this saying, Wee are equall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> in honour both good and bad. Now men are not prouoked to doe euill, onely in regard of thinges needfull when they want them: the remedy wherof he supposeth to come by the equality of goods, to the end, there be no robberies committed through constraint of hunger or cold: but also for the enioying of their pleasures, and satisfying of their couetous desires. For if their greedy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires passe their necessity, then will they fall to doing of michiefe for the remedy and helpe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> neither will they doe iniury onely for the fulfilling of their pleasures, but also when they desire <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> to enioy pleasures without sorrow. What remedy then for these three? Soothly, that the first sort <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> haue small wealth, and take paine for their liuing: that the second, vse temperatenesse and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration: the third remedy, if any be minded to attaine to pleasure of themselues, let them seeke it by no other meanes then by Philosophy: for other pleasures cannot be gotten without the helpe of many folke. Now men doe not vse to attempt any great vices or enormities for the remedy and releefe of necessities, but for the satisfaction of their excessiue and immoderate desires: as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, some vse tyranny, &amp; oppresse people with vngodly dominion: not for the auoiding of cold, but to the end, they may fulfill their vnruly desires without controulment. Therefore great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and rewards are decreed and assigned: not to him that killeth a theefe, but to him that bereaueth a Tyrant of his life. Therefore that manner of Commonweale inuented by Phaleas, is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> apt only to redresse small iniuries. Againe, hee setteth downe many meanes tending to the good gouernement and behauiours of Citizens and subiects amongst themselues, yet should hee haue had no lesse consideration of neighbours and all strangers. For of necessity this law and order ought to bee in a Commonweale, that it be alwaies ready furnished with warlike and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall force and furniture: whereof hee hath not spoken so much as one word, nor likewise of goods sufficient to serue the turne, as well in ciuill vses and necessities, as also against for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine dangers. Which goods ought not to bee so great, that they should bee coueted by neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and borderers, and by stronger and mightier men: against whose inuasions, the owners should not bee able to make resistance: nor so small, that they could not suffice to maintaine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> warre when it should bee made against them, by their equals in number, and euen matches. Hee hath determined nothing herein: yet should it not bee left vnknowne what quantities of goods are sufficient for Cities: whereof perchance that manner of limitation is best, whereby the strongest and mightiest men of power are not prouoked to inuade and make warre, in hope of reaping great profite through the excessiue plenty of richesse, there being: but rather in vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking of warres, shall consider, how their labour and charges will bee greater then the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite which they may expect by winning the victory: as Eubulus counsailed Antophradates when hee meant to besiege Atarnee: that hee should consider in what time hee might winne the place, and reckon what charge hee should bee at about the same: with which speech hee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> brought Antophradates to yeeld to his opinion, and caused him to leaue the siege. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the equality of goods dooth carry with it some profite, and yet not much. For men of worship and reputation will take great disdaine thereat, as thinking themselues worthy of greater wealth and honour than others, which is the cause that they often rise and stirre vp re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion: for the malice and naughtinesse of men is vnsatiable. At the first, they say onely two halfe pence are sufficient: but when they haue once got them, then doe they alwaies couet more and more, being pushed on by the bottomelesse and infinite desire of hauing. For the nature of couetousnesse is endlesse and infinite: toward the satisfaction and fulfilling whereof, most men cheefly apply all their industry and skill. Therefore the fittest remedy herein is not to make equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> of goods, but to procure that good men bee such by nature, as that they will not desire more then they ought, and that bad men shall not bee able to get more then they should, as it will come to passe, if the bad bee least in number, and suffer no wrong. Further, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> bee hath not taken good order in the equaling of goods, by reason hee onely maketh lands equall. For there is a richesse also of Slaues, and of Cattell, and money, and other mooueables. An equalitie therefore should bee sought for all those commodities,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:7218:61"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> or some moderate order assigned in them: or els all should bee let alone. Hee seemeth also by the establishment of such lawes to make the City small, if all Craftsmen shall bee publicke seruants,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> and not comprised within the corporation of the Citie. But if they that doe the publicke workes of Cities ought to be publicke, they should be so after the fashion of Epidamne, and as Diophan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> sometimes ordeined in Athens.

He framed his City of tenne thousand men, diuiding it into three parts, the one of Artificers, another of Land-tillers or Husbandmen, the third of men of warre and such as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> weare armour. Also he deuided the Country into three parts, the one sacred, the other publicke, the third priuate: calling that sacred, from whence the solemne sacrifices should bee furnished and made to the gods: that publicke, from whence the men of warre should be sustained: and that priuate which was assigned to the Husbandmen. Further, he supposed there were but onely three sorts of lawes, and likewise three things whereon iudgements were giuen: namely iniury, dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, and death. Besides, hee ordained one soueraine court, whereinto all causes that seemed not rightfully iudged, might bee brought by way of appeale: and stablished it of certaine picked <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> and chosen men of good yeares. He decreed that iudgements should not bee giuen in courts, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> by little counters in way of lot, but euery Iudge to haue a Tablet, therein to write <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> the sentence, if hee absolutelye condemned: but if hee absolued, then to leaue it void and unwritten on: or if hee partly condemned and partly absolued, then to declare it in writing: For hee thought that no good order which is nowe in vse and practise, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the parties that Iudge this or that, are driuen to periurie. Hee made a lawe for the honouring of them that inuent anie thing to the benefite of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale: and for the bringing vp of those children at the charges and cost of the

There is at this present a law to that effect in Athens, and in sundry other Cities.

Further, he ordained three sorts of Iudgements, to wit, of iniurie, dammage, and death, and a high and soueraigne court ouer all those for the hearing and determining of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peales to bee brought thither. Hee would haue sentences giuen, not by counters and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Because Hippodamus making the Artificer and Husbandman parts of the Cittie, tieth them to such a condition, as that they can neuer come to anie Magistrateship or Office: wherein a Cittizen is properly discerned from him that is no Cittizen: as is declared in the third booke of this worke. And this meane being taken from them it cannot bee but they will hate the Commonweale: from whence seditions doe spring. Secondly, his deuision of territories is not good, because the souldiours who <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> are put to be til<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And if the Husbandmen and the souldiours till not the gro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thirdly, his maner of deuiding of iudgements is blamed, and the common and accustomed forme and course allowed for the best. As concerning the decree that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Hippodamus hath set forth for the rewarding and honouring of them that inuent any thing to the benefit of the Commonweale Aristotle taking occasion thereby, hath here inserted the most notable disputation of all the booke, namely, whether it be expedient or not to al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> the manner of their funerals: Three daies aforehand they made a great pauilion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they laid the bones of such as were dead, and their kinsfolke and f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> bodies could not bee found. These Wagons were conducted and accompanied by all sorts of people, as well Cittizens as others that would goe, euen to the graue, where the wiues or kindred of the dead were making great mourning, weeping, and lamentation: After, all those coffers were laied into a publicke Tombe made for that purpose in the fairest suberbe of the City. This place was called Ceramicon, wherein the custome was to burie all such as died in the Warres, sauing them that were slaine in Marahone, for whom in remembrance of their singular vertue, they decreed a particular sepulchre in the same place: and immediately vpon the buriall of the corpes, the custome was, that some notable personage of the Cittie being both learned and honourable, according <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to the degree of the deceased, made a Sermon or Oration in their commendation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the people: which being ended, euery man went his way. Thucidides writeth all this in the second booke of his Hystorie of the Peloponesian Warres, where the fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Oration of Pericles is inserted. This funerall pompe was afterwards yearely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, whether they had Warres or not, with many ceremoniall combates a horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe, and diuerse exercises and playing vpon Instruments of Musicke, as Plato testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth in his Menexemus, where likewise there is a funerall Oration vnder the name of a learned and eloquent Gentlewoman named Aspasia.</p>

Againe, in what things are Husbandmen behoofefull for a Citie? As for Craftsman they are necessary therein: because euery Citie hath neede of them, and they may get their liuings with their occupations, as they doe in other Cities: But if the Husbandmen fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish victuals to the men of Warre, then are they by good reason to bee reckoned for part of the City and Commonweale.

Therefore is it not easie to consent straight way to the decree touching the honouring of the inuenters of any thing to the publicke profite, if it bee not expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> to change the lawes: For it may so fall out, that some men will persuade either the repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and abrogation of the lawes, or alteration of the forme of gouernement of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> as a common good.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> ancient lawes be very simple and barbarous.

Nowe, all men wholly bend themselues to secke, not for those <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> things which haue ben left by their ancestors, but for those which are good.

Thus doubtlesse are old customes esteemed and set by.

Eusebius in his Treatise of the preparation of the Gospell, maketh mention <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> thereof: and Diodorus the Sicilian in the first booke of his Library, writing thus: At the beginning of all things (sayth hee) the heauen and earth had one onely being and shape; But afterward vpon the separation of the elements one from another, the world tooke that order, shape, and disposition, wherein wee see it at this present: amongst the which elements, that continuall mouing which the aire hath, fell to his share: and those places which be aboue the aire to the fire by reason of the lightnesse thereof: &amp; after the selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same reason those courses which the sunne and starres enioy, fel to them for their shares: And that which was mingled with moisture, staied by reason of the heauinesse thereof, in one masse or lumpe; of the moistest part whereof came the sea, and of the hardest the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> earth, being in it selfe soft and miry: which, as soone as it had beene first dried and made tougher with the heat of the sunne, and after by the force of the same heat, swolne and puft vp in the vpper part, there forthwith bred and sprung vp in many and diuerse parts, certaine humours engendring rottennesses and putrifactions, couered and hidden with small thinne skins. Whereas then, the generation is wrought in moist things by putting heat thereto, and that by night the aire spread abroad, yeeldeth moisture to the same, which taketh strength in the day by the vertue and power of the sunne: At last, those rottennesses and putrifactions being guided to their vttermost course, did procreate (like as if the time of their deliuery had ben come) the shapes and formes of all sorts of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> creatures and liuing things, after that those small skinnes wherein they were inclosed, were broken: of which liuing things, they that had receiued most store of heate, were made Foules, &amp; flew vp into the higher region: they that had most store of earth, remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned serpents and other like beasts: they that held the nature of the water, were carried and put into the element of their owne complexion and called Fishes.

Vpon which occasion, it is written in the second law of the beginning of right, in the old digests, That it is to small purpose to haue Lawes in a Cittie, except there bee some bodie authorised to put them in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution.

               <head>CHAP. VII. Of the Commonweale of the Lacedemonians.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>IN the Lacedemonians Commonweale, and also in the Cretane, and almost in all others, two things are to be considered: the one, whether there be any thing well or ill ordained, according to the right forme and description of a Commonweale: the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> other, whether there bee any thing contrary to that supposition and forme of policie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> which they propounded to themselues. Now it is fully resolued and concluded amongst all, that in a well gouerned state, the principals and cheefe rulers ought not to giue themselues to necessary workes: but yet how this ought to bee done, is not easie to bee comprehended. For oftentimes the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> bondslaues of Thessaly, (called the Penestie) haue rebelled against the Thessalonians: and the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotians conspired against the Lacedemonians: watching and spying out ordinarily the time of their aduersities: the which thing hath not hither to happened vnto the Cretans: the cause wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of peraduenture may be this, in that it is not expedient nor profitable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>or the neighbour Citties, (albeit they make warre vpon each other) to assist such rebels against their maisters, least they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> should be likewise dealt withall by their neighbours. But all the borderers of the Lacedemonians, as the Argiues, the Messenians, and Arcadians, were deadly enemies vnto them: And then did the Penestians of Thessalie begin first to reuolt, whilest the Thessalians made warre with their neighbours the Athenians, Perraebians, and Magnesians. Now suppose there were no other thing but this, yet it seemeth to be a matter of great care and trouble, how to conuerse with such kind of people: for if one giue them too much liberty, they growe proud and insolent, and equall them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues with their maisters: and if on the contrary, they be roughly and sharpely handled, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell and conspire. Seeing therefore that they are so disturbed with this Ilotie, it is certain, that they haue not found a good forme of gouernement.</hi>
               </p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/>
               <p>There were in Greece three notable Commonweales, the Cretane, the Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian, and the Athenian; ordained by three notable Lawgiuers, Minos, Lycurgus, &amp; So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon: of which three he beginneth to intreat, and first of the Lacedemonian, which surpas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the rest, as wel in regard of the firme establishment thereof (the like whereof was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer seen) for it continued about seuen hundred years, as also in regard of the glory of the martial deeds thereof, hauing a great while possessed the Empire of Greece. Aristotle, a seuere and strict examiner of all things, findeth fault with certain notable articles in the same, to wit, the conuersation and demeanure of the Ilotians, the liberty of women, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> election of Magistrates for terme of life, the authority of the Ephores or Tribunes, the ordering of taxes and treasure, &amp; the end and marke whereat it shot, which was to haue dominion. Which points it is not possible to vnderstand, without taking a view of the maner &amp; forme of gouernment, in such state as Lycurgus deliuered it: &amp; as we could ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of Plato, Xenophon, Plutarke, Polybius, Strabo, and other good Authours. Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curgus therefore, the eleuenth, descending in the right line fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Hercules, being the yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger brother of Polydecte king of the Lacedemonians, gouerned the kingdome after the decease of this Polydecte, first as king, and after (when there was a man child born of the wife of the same Polydecte, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at his decease he had left great with child) as protector <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> of the orphan being born after his fathers decease. And forasmuch as, if the yong prince should die, the succession of the kingdome appertained to Lycurgus, as vncle &amp; next of kin vnto him: fearing least if it should so fal out, the fault therof would be laid vpon him, as some of his enemies had already reproched him: and fearing that suspition, he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew himselfe fro Lacedemonia, &amp; went into Crete: where falling in acquaintance with Thales the Musitian &amp; Lawmaker, he learned of him the lawes of the country, and how
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:7218:68"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Radamanthus &amp; Minos had receiued them from Iupiter, and deliuered them vnto men. From thence he passed into AEgipt, where he learnt the laws of that nation. Then came he into Chio, where hee had conference with Homer. Thence returning into his owne country, he found his nephew Charilaus reigning: &amp; meaning to apply himselfe about the making of lawes, he asked counsel of the god Apollo in Delphos. Then began he to publish them, being for the most part like to those of Minos, but fathered vpon Apollo, as the other were vpon Iupiter. By such manner of proceeding, Lycurgus brought to light such a forme &amp; patterne of gouernment, as no man before him had inuented, and as none other after him could imitate, and hath presented to the sight of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that thinke <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the definition of a perfect wise man to bee a matter onely imagined in the aire, and that none such can be really and effectually in this world, one whole Citie liuing and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>elfe philosophically, that is to say, according to the precepts and rules of perfect wisdome. By means whereof, he hath in glory rightfully surmounted all them that euer tooke vpon them to write or stablish the gouernment of any ciuil or politick state<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> And thereupon (saith Aristotle) after his death they yeelded him lesse honor in Lacedemonia then hee had deserued, though they yeelded vnto him as much as was possible: for they erected a temple vnto him, and ordained an yearely solemne sacrifice for him, as it had ben a god. After this maner vndertook Lycurgus to alter the gouernment of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweale, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and wholly to change all the forme of the state: supposing that the only ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of certain particular lawes &amp; ordinances would not serue to any purpose, no more than to a body all marred and full of all sorts of diseases, the appointing of some sleight medson; except hee would first giue order for the purging, losing, and consuming of all euill humours, to the end, to appoint vnto it afterwards a newe forme and rule of life. When he had taken this resolution in his mind, he went (before any putting in vre ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) vnto the City of Delphos, where, after he had sacrificed vnto Apollo, he asked coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of him touching his affaires, and receiued that so greatly renowmed Oracle, wherby the Prophetesse Pythia, called him, Beloued of the gods, and rather a god then a man. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> And as touching his request for grace to establish good lawes in his countrey, shee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered that Apollo did grant it vnto him, and that hee should ordaine the best and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectest forme of Commonweale that euer was in the world. This answere encouraged him more then before: so that he began to reueale his secret purpose to certaine of the principall persons of the towne, praying and exhorting them secretly to yeeld their fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance and assistance therein: trying them first whom he knew for his friends, and by little &amp; little euermore winning some others to his side that ioined with him in his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise. After this, when oportunity serued, on a certaine morning he caused an assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in the market place of thirty of the cheefe men of the Towne in armour, to fray and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> restraine those that should withstand that which they had determined to doe. Wherby it appeareth, that Lycurgus shewed in effect, that it was a hard matter to alter the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of a Commonweale without open force and apparant fear. And thus almost all founders or reformers of Commonweales and kingdomes haue accustomed to doe: who had not ben els heard, obeied, nor followed, as witnesseth this, that Lycurgus him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe had one of his eies plucked out by setting vp the equality of possessions. Nowe in this change and alteration of the state by Lycurgus, there were many nouelties brought in: but the cheefest and greatest of all, was the founding and institution of the Senate, which being mingled with the power of the kings, and made equall to them, as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> the authority of matters of importance, was as Plato sayeth, a counterpoise or ballance of welfare to the whole bodie of the Commonweale, which aforetime was euermore wauering, inclining one while to tyrannie when the kings had too much power, and another while to confusion and disorder of the people, when the common people tooke too much authoritie vpon them. And Lycurgus did place betweene them both this Councell of Senatours, which was, as it were, a strong barre, keeping the two extremities in euen ballance, and giuing stedfast and sure
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:7218:69"/>
footing to the state of the Commonweale, by reason the eight and twenty Senatours,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> of whom the body of the Senate consisted, sometimes tooke part with the kings, as far as was needfull for the resistance of the malapertnesse and rashnesse of the people: and contrariwise, nowe and then strengthened the part of the people against the kings, to keepe them from vsurping any tyrannical power. He made choise of this number of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natours, to the end, that the entire body of the Counsell should consist of thirty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in the whole, by putting the two kings vnto them:
Which stablishment was au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorised by the very Oracle of the god Apollo, called Retra: which is as much to say; as decree or sentence. The tenour whereof was thus: <q>After thou shalt haue builded a Temple to Iupiter Syllanvan, and to Minerua Syllanyan, and deuided the people into <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> Tribe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, thou shalt establish a Senate of thirty Counsellers, comprehending therein the two kings: and shalt assemble the people together, according to the occasion of times, in the place that is scituate betweene the bridge and the riuer of Gracyon: where the Senatours shall propound matters, and breake off the assemblies, and it shall not be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for the people to make any Oration there.</q>
Afterwards the kings Polydore and The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opompe added thereunto, that where the people would in any wise alter the aduise pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to the Counsell by the Senate, it should be lawfull for the kings and the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ours to breake of the Councell, and disanull the decree thereof: as hauing altered, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guised, and changed to worse, the sentences and propositions set foorth by the Senate:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> and persuading the people, that this addition, as well as the principall, came from the Oracle of Apollo. Then Lycurgus hauing thus temperated the forme of gouernment, it seemed neuerthelesse to them that came after him, that this small number of thirtie persons who made vp the Senate, was yet too mighty, and had too much authority. By meanes whereof, for the bridling of them, they gaue them (as Plato sayth) a bit, which was the power and authority of the Ephores, that is to say, controulers, who were crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted about one hundred and thirty yeares after the death of Lycurgus. The second no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelty that Lycurgus made, and was the hardiest ente<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>prise of all, consisted in causing a new diuision of lands. For whereas there was in the Countrey of Lacedemonia most <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> great oddes and inequality between the inhabitants, because some, and the greatest part were so poore, that they had not so much as an inch of land, and others, and that a very small number so rich, that they possessed all: hee considered, that for the banishing and hunting out of his Citty, ouerlustinesse, enuie, couetousnesse and delights; and also ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chesse and pouerty, which are also great pestilences in Citties and Commonweales: there was no readier way then to persuade his Citizens to set againe in common all the lands, possessions, and heritages of their Country, and to deuide them new again equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly between themselues, to the intent, to liue altogether from thence forward as brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: so that one should not haue more in possessions then another, and that they should not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> seeke one to excell another in any other thing than vertue onely: deeming that there ought to bee no other oddes or inequality betweene the inhabitants of one selfesame Cittie, sauing that which proceedeth from the blame of dishonestie, and the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of vertue and honestie. According to this imagination, hee effectually executed the diuision of lands. For he diuided all the rest of the Countrey of Laconie wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thirtie thousand equall parts, which hee distributed to the inhabitants about Sparta: and of the lands neerer to the very City of Sparta it selfe, he made nine thousand other parts, which he diuided amongst <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he naturall burgesses of Sparta, who be they that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly are called S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>artans. Euery one of these portions was such, that yearely it yeelded <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> to the owner, seuentie bushels of barley for a man, and twelue for a woman: and of wine and other liquid commodities in like proportion, esteeming this quantity to be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to maintaine and preserue a mans body sound, nimble, and lustie, and that nothing els was needfull and requisite. He went about also to bring into one, all their moueables, and then to diuide them equally, to the end, that all manner of inequality might bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away. But when hee perceiued, that the people tooke it impatiently to haue their
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:7218:69"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> goods thus openly taken from them: he proceeded therein closely and vnderhand, and so deluded craftily their auarice and couetousnesse, for first of all he disclaimed all kinde of money made of gold or siluer, and ordained that yron money should onely bee vsed, wherof also a great and heauie masse was valued at a small rate, in such sort, that a peece of a hundred crownes, would trouble and hinder a whole roome in a house, and aske a yoke of Oxen to draw it vp and downe. Now by this meanes gold and siluer being thus banished out of Laconia, it was necessarie that many vices and enormities went out with them: for who would be willing to rob, steale, receiue or retaine a thing which he could no waies hide and conceale, and which he had no great reason to desire, nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to possesse, the case being so that he coulde not translate it to any other vse: because that when the yron which they purposed to coine, was fire hote, they quenched it with vinegre, and so extinguished the strength and hardnesse thereof, in such sort as it lost all fitnesse for other seruices and workes euer after, being become so sharpe and so brittle, that it could not abide the hammer or the fire any more. Next after this, he banished all superfluous and vnprofitable trades, and albeit he had not banished them by expresse e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, yet had they all, or at least the most part, of themselues togither with the vse of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, when they had not found any more meanes of gaine, and riddance of their workes to others: by reason that their yron coyne was not currant in other Cities of Greece, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> but rather mocked and laughed at in all places: And by this means, the Lacedemonians could not buy any strange merchandises, neither did there any shippe of trafficke haunt their ports; no affecting Rhetorician came into their countrie to teach the art of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile pleading; no Southsaier to forecalculate good fortunes; no Bawde to maintaine stewes and houses of brodelrie; no Goldsmith or Ieweller to make or sell trinkets of gold or siluer to adorne ladies: because all these things tend onely to this end, to gayne and hoord vp money, whereof there was no vse in that place: and so delights being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted of those things which nourish and maintain them, began to wither and vanish by little and little, and at last to fall of themselues, when as the rich could haue no more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> than the poore, and riches and wealth could haue no means of ostentation and publicke shew, but remayned idle within dores, without being able to serue their maisters in any stead. But further he being desirous to persecute yet more the superfluitie and delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous pleasures of his Citizens, to the end to exterminat and roote out on all sides this greedie desire of hauing and enriching: Hee made another third ordinance, newe and most excellent, which was, that concerning bankets: by the which he willed and ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that they should eat together by companies, and that al of the same meats, &amp; those none but such as were namely specified by his decree: by the which also it was expresly forbidden to eat apart priuatly vpon rich tables and sumptuous beds, abusing thus the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> labours of excellent workemen, and daintie Cookes, to fat and feede themselues in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, and in the darke as it were, as men vse to fatte rauenous and greedie beasts: which thing spoileth and corrupteth not onely the conditions of the mind, but also the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions of the body, when the bridle of libertie is thus let loose to all sensualitie and luxurious gluttonie: whereupon it followeth, that much sleepe must afterward be had, to boile and digest that ouerplus of meat which is ingested: and also the helpe of hote bathes, long rest, and sett diet must needs bee vsed, like as if he were sicke of some gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous disease. It was not lawful for them to eat priuatly in their houses, before they came into the common halles, and so preuent by secret farcing themselues, the publicke ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> in the place appointed: for euery man had his eye readie to note expresly those which did not eat and drinke with a good appetite in the assemblie: and not onely so, but also his tongue readie to blame and reprooue them as gluttons, or at least as men disdaining in a certaine daintinesse, to eat in publicke with the rest. The Cretans called these publike banquets <hi>Andria,</hi> and the Lacedemonians <hi>Phiditia:</hi> and this last, eyther because these were such places wherein a man might learne to liue soberly and thriftily (for thrift or sparing, in the Greeke tongue is called <hi>Phido</hi>) or because in those places

mutuall amities and friendships were engendred, as if they would haue called them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> 
                  <hi>Philitia</hi> (<hi>i.</hi>) places or feasts of loue, putting a <hi>d</hi> for an <hi>l.</hi> It might also bee, that the first letter was ouer-added as superfluous, and then it should bee <hi>Editia:</hi> because men as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled together in these places to eate and take their repast. Thus they assembled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither by fifteenes or thereabouts in euery hall, and euery one of them brought at the beginning of each moneth, a bushell of meale, eight gallons of Wine, fiue pound of cheese, and two pound and a halfe of figges: and ouer and aboue, a little peece of their money to buy their meat. But besides all this, when any of them sacrificed in his house, hee sent the first fruits of his sacrifice into the publicke hall. Likewise, if any had taken any Venison in Hunting, hee sent one peece thereof thither: for in these two cases one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> it was lawfull for them to eate priuately, to wit, when they had sacrificed beastes to their gods, and when they returned late home from hunting: otherwise, they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to bee continually present in the hals at the common meetings, if they would eate. Which custome they obserued a long while most strictly. Their children also fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented these meate-assemblies no lesse than schooles of honour and temperance, where they heard manie good and graue sentences and deuises touching the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Commonwealth vnder maisters that were not mercenary: and where they learnt also to play vpon one another in speeches, and to quippe and mocke each other pleasantly, and yet without all sharpe girding, or dishonest iesting, and being thus moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> not to bee angrie or discontented. It was an ordinary custome, that when they ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into the common hall, the eldest among them pointing to the dore, saied: Let no speech here spoken, go out of these dores or ouer this threshold. Also whosoeuer would be receiued into any of those meat-assemblies, must be first approued and allowed of by all the residue. The most exquisite and daintie meate which they had, was that which they called blacke broth: so that when that was serued in, the olde men would eate no flesh, but left it to the younger, and they by themselues fed vpon the broth onely. After they had thus soberly eat and drunke togither, they returned without light euery one to his home: for it was not permitted to walke either thither or elsewhere with a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> to the end, they might accustome themselues to march boldly euery where by night and in the darke as wel as in the light. This was the order and forme of their <hi>Phiditia,</hi> or meate assemblies, or loue feasts, as we may fitly tearme them. As concerning other light matters, touching contracts and bargaines betwixt man and man, being thinges which often change &amp; alter, sometimes on this, sometimes on that fashion, as necessity requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth; he thought best not to tie or reduce them vnder any written edicts or constraints, nor yet to establish in them any setled custome not to bee changed: but rather to leaue them to the discretion &amp; arbitrement of men which had ben well instructed &amp; brought vp, to the end, to take from or adde vnto them, according as the occurrence and occasion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> of time required. Supposing (to be breefe) that the cheefe scope and drift of a good esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blisher or reformer of a Commonweale ought to bee this, to cause that men might bee wel instructed &amp; brought vp in vertue. Lycurgus as hath been said, called these his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances <hi>Retres,</hi> which is as much to say, as graue sentences, or Oracles giuen by the god Apollo: neither would he euer suffer that any of these should be put in writing: but it is expressely mentioned in one place, that his meaning was not that any of his decrees should be committed to writing. For as touching that which is of principall power and force to make a City happy &amp; vertuous, he thought that it ought to be imprinted in the hearts by education, and in the maners of men by custome, that it might there remaine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> vnchangeable. Good willingnesse of mind is the strongest bond which can bee knit and made to constrain men to liue wel: &amp; the bent which they get by good instruction from their first infancy, is it which maketh euery man to serue in stead of a law vnto himselfe. Plutarke esteemed this to be one of the most happy &amp; excellentest things which Lycur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus brought into his Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monweale, namely, the great leisure &amp; idlenes which he besto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed vpon his Citizens, when as he suffered the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not to employ themselues to any base or
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:7218:70"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> mechanical trade: &amp; that it was not needful to trauel &amp; toile for the heaping vp of riches in such a place, where wealth and opulency was neither profitable, nor esteemed. There were amongst the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nothing but dauncing, feasts, sports, banquets, pastimes in hunting, or exercises of their bodies, and such like, all the while that they were not busied in War. Solon on the other side ordained great punishments for idlenesse, and would that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one should giue an account of his life and exercise. And at this day in the lawe of Mahomet euery one is bound to be skilfull in some trade, euen from the highest Bassa and his children, who all learne some Art or other, to the lowest and basest drudge. But it is time to returne to Aristotle, and to the exposition of our text, hauing forealleadged <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> this discourse, to the end, to haue the better vnderstanding thereof.</p>

And so Lycurgus also or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained in Sparta or Lacedemonia. Of which matter Plutarch in the life of Solon wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth thus: Lycurgus (saith hee) who inhabited a Cittie, wherein there was no resort nor ariuall of anie strangers, and which had so large territories that might sufficiently fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> twise as many people as there were resident, and which besides was enuironned on all sides with a great multitude of Ilotians: whom it was very much expedient to keep from idlenesse, and alwaies to hold them in low subiection, constraining them continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to trauel and labor both for themselues &amp; others: this was a most wise decree, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to keepe his Cittizens alwaies occupied in the exercise of armes, without the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or practise of any other trade of life, discharging them from all other paineful oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupations and handicrafts.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>Ilotians conspired against the Lacedemonians.</hi>] These Ilotians were men enthral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> by the law of armes, who tilled the grounds of the Lacedemonians, and yeelded vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> them thereout a certain rent and reuenue euery yeare. And by reason that they often rebelled against their lords, Plutarch reporteth, that there was in Lacedemonia a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine secret decree, that the gouernors which had the ouersight of the youth, at certain periodes of times, should select out some whom they iudged best aduised, and send them into the country here and there, carrying with them dags only, and that which was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie for their liuing and sustenance. Now these yoong men dispersed vp and downe in the countrey, hid themselues in the day time in some couert and secret places, where they rested and refreshed themselues: but in the night beset and lay in wait in the high waies, and there slew euerie Ilote that they could find: and sometimes also in the broad <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> day they ranged through the fields, killing and slaying the mightiest and strongest that they could come by (as Thucidides in his history of the Peloponesian warre recordeth: where he saith further, that certaine Ilotes, a good number at a certaine time were by a publicke decree of the Spartanes crowned, as being enfranchised and made free, and so led through all the Temples of the gods, in reward of their good seruices which they had exploited most valiantly for the Commonwealth:) and thus in short time it could not be perceiued what was become of them, although the number of them amounted to two thousand: in such sort, that neuer any man heard it spoken, neither then nor af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, after what maner they died or were made away. And Aristotle besides that which al <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> others affirme, saieth: That the Ephories or Tribunes as soone as they were installed in their offices, denounced warre against the Ilotes to that purpose, that it might bee law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to kill them howsoeuer. Well, it is most certaine, that amongst other thinges they handled them most roughly; for sometimes they compelled them to drinke Wine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixt with water, in such quantitie, till they were starke drunke therewith: after they led them thus drunke into the common hals of their meat assemblies, to shewe vnto their children what a villanie and ouglie thing it was to bee drunke: and then caused them to

                  </gap>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> them expressely those which were comely and honest. Plutarke thinketh, that the Lacedemonians begun to vse this notable cruelty and roughnesse, long after the death of Lycurgus, and namely after that great earthquake which happened in Sparta: at what time the Ilotes rebelling against them, took part with the Messenians, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted many outrages in their Countrey, and put their Cittie into the greatest danger that it euer was in. Plato <hi>De Legibus, lib.</hi> 6. speaking of bondslaues, mentioneth these Ilotes, Penests, and Periaeces of the Cretans.</p>
               <p>MOREOVER, <hi>the libertie which was giuen vnto women, is hurtfull and incommodious,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> both for the purpose of their Commonweale, and also for the happie estate thereof. For euen as the man and woman are parts and members of a familie, so likewise a Citie may be deuided into <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> two equal parts, one consisting of men and the other of women: so that in any Citie where the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering &amp; discipline of women is not good, there the one halfe or moyetie of the Citie is thought to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> be out of order, as it is in that: for the Law-giuer desiring to make all the Citie temperate and able to sustaine labours, hath attained his purpose in regard of men, but not of women, who are permitted to liue in all licentiousnesse and dissolute intemperancie: in such sort, that necessarily <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> riches are honoured and esteemed in such a Commonwealth, especially where men are in subie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> to women, as for the most part it is amongst warlike and military Natione, except the Celts <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> or some other which openly approue the vnnaturall fellowship with their owne sexe. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it seemeth that he which first deuised fables, did not without cause couple Mars and Venus togither: for all such kind of people are giuen either to Sodomie against nature, or to the hunting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> of harlots and strumpets. The which mischiefe was amongst the Lacedemonians, where the most part of their affaires were ordered by the direction of women. For what difference is there, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther women command in their owne persons, or that the commanders be commanded by women, doth it not all come to one passe? Further, whereas audacitie and boldnesse is nothing auaileable in ordinary businesses, except only in matters of warre: the women of Lacedemonia were in this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> respect most hurtfull to their Commonweale, as they euidently made proofe of at the inuasion of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> the Thebanes, for they were so farre from being profitable, as women of other Cities were, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> they rather raised vp more trouble and tumult in the Citie, then the enemies themselues. But it seemeth that such libertie was permitted to the Lacedemonian women not without iust cause: for the men were often abroad from their homes, by reason of the continual warre which they waged; first with the Argiues, after with the Arcadians and Messenians. And when they enioyed any peace, they yeelded themselues to their Law-giuers discretion to be prepared and made fit against <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> warre: in which kind of life, all most excellent vertues were to bee found. Some say that Lycur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus attempted to bring women in subiection to his lawes: but when hee saw that they made head against him to withstand them, hee surceassed from his enterprise: and this was the cause which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> threw them into those inconueniences, and consequently into this errour. But our purpose is not to inquire what deserueth excuse, and what not, but what is wel or ill ordained: for if the discipline of women be not well ordered, it seemeth (as it hath beene said before) not onely to cause an vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie and indecorum in the Commonweale, but also to engender auarice and couetousnesse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lacedemonians haue euer affied and ascribed very much vnto their women, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering them to looke into and to meddle more with the affaires of the Commonweale, then they themselues did with the affaires of the house.

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:7218:71"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> halfe of their felicitie and happinesse seemeth to be wanting.</p>
               <p>FOR <hi>the Lawgiuer desiring to make all the Citie temperate and able to sustaine labour, hath <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> attained his purpose in regard of men, but not of women.</hi>] Of the education and nurture of men hath beene spoken before, that of women was such as followeth: First, the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuer willed and commanded, that the yong women should harden and inure their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to labour, by exercising running, wrastling, throwing the barre, and whirling the dart: to the end, that both the fruit of their wombes which they should conceiue, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king deepe root in a lustie and strong body, might burnish and grow the better: and also that they themselues being enabled &amp; made strong by such exercises, might with more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> courage and ease endure the trauailes of childbed. And that he might depriue them of all delicacie and effeminate tendernesse, hee accustomed the young maids as well as the young men to labour and to dance naked at certaine feasts and solemne sacrifices, and to sing in the presence of yong gallants, to whome oftentimes they would giue bitter cuts, touching them to the quicke, which had forgotten their duty in any respect. And sometimes also they rehearsed in their songs the praises and commendations of them which deserued the same: whereby they engraued in the hearts of yong men an excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great emulation and contention of honour. For hee that had been commended by them for his valour and prowesse, was presently lifted vp in courage to attempt greater <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> matters afterward: and the bitings and quippes which they gaue vnto others, were no lesse stinging and sharpe, then the most seuere admonitions &amp; chastisements that could come vnto them, considering that it was done in the presence of the kings, Senators, and whole people, who came alwaies together to see and hear their contention. But as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching that, that the maids shewed themselues naked in publicke; Plutarch striueth to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse it, saying that thereupon arose amongst them no naughtinesse nor vncleannesse at all: but that their strife and contention was accompanied with al honestie and modesty, and void of immodestie and lecherie: yea rather on the contrary, that it carried with it an accustoming and inuring them to the discipline of their countrey, and an emulation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> amongst themselues, who should haue the strongest and lustiest bodie. And which is more, it lifted vp in some sort their heart with courage, and made them more valiant and magnanimious, by making knowne that it was no lesse seemely for them to exercise and professe prowesse, and to contend among themselues who should haue the prize, than for men. Whence it proceeded, that the Lacedemonian women had the heart to speake and thinke of themselues, that which Gorgon the wife of king Leonidas one day an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered a strange lady deuising with her, and saying: That there were no women in the world saue the Lacedemonian, that ouer-ruled and commanded men. No more (replied she) are there any women in the world that bring forth men, saue they. Moreouer, this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> was a bait to allure yong men to marry them, I mean these sports, daunces, and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which yong maids practised in the presence of young men. And yet besides these allurements, he appointed a note of infamie and discredite against those which refused to marrie: and they that would marry also, must first rauish by force those maids whom they would espouse, who after had their haire shauen off vnto their bare skin, and then were attired with mens garments, and breeches of the same, and placed in beds alone vpon certaine pallets, where the new married came to lie with them. Plato <hi>De Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lib.</hi> 5. alloweth in his Commonweale such publicke exercise of yong maids naked with young men, attributing the same workes to both of them, willing also that the old men <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> and women should exercise themselues togither after the same manner.</p>
               <p>ESPECIALLY <hi>where men are in subiection to women, as for the most part amongst <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> warlike and military nations.</hi>] Great warriours are ordinarily great whorehunters, and Nations most warlike, are commonly most giuen ouer to most licentious luxuriousnes, whence arose that fable, which fained that the god Mars lay with the goddesse Venus, &amp; that they were enwrapped and entangled in a chain by Vulcan her husband, as is recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Homer and Ouid.</p>

By succession of time, they grewe in this their soueraigntie so insupportable, that at the last they were slaine, and their office suppressed. Wee read, that King Agis king of Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonia, when hee perceaued that the auncient vertue of the Lacedemonians was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed, and consequently the strength of their gouernment greatly empaired, began to bethinke himselfe what remedie was fittest for their reformation, and for bringing them to the first orders of Lycurgus, from the which they were farre gone astray. Whereat the Ephores being discontent, murthered him at the preparation of this enterprise, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he aimed at no other end, but to bring in tyrannie into their Cittie. After him <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> Cleomenes succeeded, who had no lesse desire to bring it to passe, then his predecessor had: he found out the records of Agis, whereby hee vnderstoode his plot and pretence, and perceiued that his misse and errour was, in that he vndertooke such an enterprise of weight, before that hee was in full and quiet possession of all the Lacedemonian power. Therefore he went another way to worke, he slew the Ephores, and all other that might any wise withstand him: and so by this meanes restored easily the auncient laws of Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curgus. Whereby he won vnto himselfe great renowme, yea as great, or more, then Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curgus himselfe: and sure he had reuiued halfe-dead Lacedemonia, but for the vnhappy comming of the Macedonians, whose furious onset he could not possibly resist, his own <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> force alone being too weake, and the rest of the Grecians refusing to succour him, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was ouercome, and all his excellent purposes and designes annihilated and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.

               <p>THIS manner of assembling at meat, hath beene already declared, Euery man furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed a certain quantitie of victuals in these assemblies consisting of fifteenes. And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer could not furnish his rate, was excluded from the honours and Offices of the Commonweale. This course Aristotle blameth, affirming it better to haue made those feasts at the charge of the Commonweale.</p>
               <p>SOME <hi>men also haue iustly blamed the law touching their admirals, as a law that is the cause <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> of sedition: for by adding to the kings, who are the heads in the warres, the perpetuall authoritie and power of the sea, it is in a manner the ordeining of another kingdome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>FORASMVCH as they haue sought in this Commonweale to abase the kingly state, and to moderate it by diuerse meanes, they forgot themselues when they added vnto it the perpetuall authority of the sea, which was in a manner, to double the authority and power by sea and by land.</p>
               <p>YET <hi>further, the Law-makers inuention may be blamed, as also Plato hath found fault with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> it in his lawes. For the institution of all his Lawes tendeth to one vertue, namely, warlike forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> which serueth for victory. Therefore they preserued themselues by warring, and after they had conquered and gotten to themselues the Empire, then were they presently vndone, for that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> they could not liue at rest, nor doe any better exercise then the exercises of warre: Neither is the errour any lesse, in that they thinke the goods for which they fight, ought rather to bee gotten by

               <p>PLATO in his first booke <hi>De Legibus,</hi> Aristotle in the seuenth booke of his Politicks, chap. 2. 3. and 14. and Polybye of his history, <hi>lib.</hi> 6. doe blame the Commonweale of Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curgus, as too warlike, saying, that all his Lawes were well ordained to make men vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, but not to make them iust nor vpright. Notwithstanding, Plutarke answering them, sayth: That Lycurgus shot at no such marke, as to leaue his City commanding ouer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but rather deeming, that the felicity as well of a Cittie as of a particular man, dooth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> cheefly consist in the exercise of vertue, and in the vnity and concord of the inhabitants: he hath composed and framed his forme of gouernement, to the end, that his Cittizens should waxe free hearted, content with their owne, and temperate in all their deeds, for the most long maintenance and conseruation of their state. That the selfesame intention also Plato, Diogenes, and Zenon, haue had in writing their books, wherein they haue reasoned of the gouernment of Commonweales: and likewise all other great and skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full personages that haue vndertaken to write of the same matter: but that they haue left nothing behind them but writing and bare words only. Xenophon, who matched learning with chiualrie, and was a great Captaine in his time, in his Treatise of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonian <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Commonweale, dooth wonderfullly commend this institution of Lycur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus: And hee being a martiall man, and returning from that so famous expedition of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia, withdrew himselfe into the iurisdiction of the Lacedemonians, where hee liued a great while, being banished out of the Cittie of Athens, whereof hee was a naturall subiect.</p>

Sith there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in these daies the Lacedemonians haue no more dominion, it is certaine they are no more happy, nor their Lawmaker good. For it is a mockery, that persisting still in his Lawes, &amp; hauing no hinderance in the vse thereof, they haue lost notwithstanding their happie life. So from the time that the Lacedemonians began to take their ease, they not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> only diminished, but also by little and little, destroyed their noble and famous Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweale.

For all enemies and enuious persons being whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ouerthrowne and destroyed, it were a danger that the Commonweale of Rome being instructed and furnished for the Warres, and the Romane youth brought vp in martiall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> affaires, would turne their weapons against themselues, and worke their owne decay. Which counsell although it was refused by the Senate, yet the disposition of matters that fell out after, shewed well that it was wise and discreet counsell. For after the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Carthage, the ciuill warres began welneere presently to be kindled, wherby the most flourishing and most mighty Commonweale that euer was, was in the end ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne, and that Cittie which was the richest of all others, and the lady and mistresse of the world, became a prey to the barbarous nations.</p>

               <p>THE Commonweale of Lacedemon as Polybius writeth in his sixt booke, was wel ordained, to retaine the Cittizens in concord and modestie, and to preserue their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie a long time, insomuch, that they that publickely aime at that marke, cannot possiblie find a better order. For the equalities of possessions and their plaine and common man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> of liuing, made their conuersation modest priuately, and the Commonweale peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Also their continuall exercise in trauaile, and custome to indure great labour from their infancie, made them hardie and courageous, and suffered no leudnesse to breede amongst them, or to bee drawne thither from other places: but for the making of them maisters ouer their neighbours, and for the vndertaking of warres out of their country it was altogether vnsufficient. While they warred with their neighbours for the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Morea, they could furnish the fame, by reason they had their necessary prouisions ready at a becke, and quicke returne: But afterward, when they aspired to the Empire of Greece, and began to spread their armies vpon the sea, and to make voyages out of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> with armies by land, they put their liberty forthwith in danger. For their yron mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and exchange of yearely fruits, could not suffice their necessities, obseruing the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of Lycurgus. For such manner of enterprises required currant money, and vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals out of forraine countries. Therefore were they forced to haue recourse to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians, to set tributes vpon the Iland<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>THe Commonweale of Crete is somewhat like the former, and hath certaine things that are no worse ordained, and in diuerse others againe, it is lesse adorned and polished: for the Lacedemonian Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale (as it seemeth, and is reported) hath in many points imitated the Commonweale of Crete. Also the most part of old ancient thinges, are lesse corrected, then those that be new. For the report goeth, that Lycur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> yeelding vp the Protectorship of king Charilas, departed out of his country; and abode a long time in Crete, by occasion of kindred: For the Lictrans did issue and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> come from the Lacedemonians. And they that came in this Colonie from Lac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>demon, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> those lawes which the auncient inhabitants of the Countrey of Crete did vse: the which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> lawes the Perioecians doe still vse to this day in the very same order that Minos first deliuered <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> the same vnto them. Now this Island doth seeme to haue such a scituation as is naturall and fit to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> rule all Greece. For it abutteth to the sea euery way, and they be welneere all Grecians that dwell ouer the sea coasts: and at one part it is not farre srom Peloponese, and in another part is neere to Asia, shooting toward Triope and Rhodes. By reason wherof, Minos obtained the Empire of the sea, and brought certaine Ilands vnder his obedience, and made other apt to be inhabited. At last he died in an enterprise in Sicily, neer vnto Camica. Therfore the discription &amp; ordaining of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Commonweale of Crete, is in a certaine proportion answerable to the Lacedemonian: For as the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Ilotians till the ground for the Lacedemonians, so doe the Perioecians for the Cretans. And both the Lacedemonians and Cretans, haue assemblies ordeined for their diet, which the Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians in ancient time did not call Phidities, but Andries, as the Cretans did: insomuch, that the custome seemeth to haue come from thence. So they agree in the order of the Commonweale: for the Ephores haue the selfesame power, which they that are called Cosmi, haue in Crete; sauing that there be fiue Ephores, and tenne Cosmi. In like sort, the Senatours are equall to the Senators, whom they call the Counsell. The Cretans aforetime had a kingdome, which they did afterwards rid away: and the Cosmi haue ouerfight and authoritie in all matters concerning the Warres. All men are admitted into the publicke assemblies, where nothing is done, sauing the ratifying <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of the decrees of the Senators and of the Cosmi. Further, the feasts amongst the Cretans, are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ordeined then amongst the Lacedemonians: For in Lacedemon, euery man contributeth by head his rated share, for default of performance whereof, the lawe disfranchiseth him of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree and freedome in the Commonweale, as hath ben before declared. The fashion of the Cretans is more sociable, for of all their publicke fruits and breed of cattell, and of the customes and rents yeelded by the Perioecians, one part is appointed for the seruice of the gods, and for the common charges, and the other part for the banquets: so that all men, women, and children haue their food of the common charge and prouision: so the Lawgiuer hath deuised many things wisely &amp; cunningly concerning sobrietie, as a thing very behoofefull: and touching diuorces, to the end, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> there should not be too many children, and allowing buggerie: wherein, whether hee hath done well or euill, we will dispute that in another place. That therefore the feastes and meate assemblies are better ordained in Crete then in Lacedemon, it is manifest and cleare: but the stablishment of the Cosmi, is worse then that of the Ephores. For the euill that is sound in the Ephores, is also in them, being either of them created alike out of the common people. But that commodity which is found in the one Commonweale, wanteth in the other. For <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

sorts of men, doth desire the conseruation of the state: but here in Crete they chuse not the Cosmi <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> out of all degrees, but out of certain families and stockes, and the Senators out of them that haue ben Cosmies: of whom the same may bee saied which is spoken of them of Lacedemon, to wit, that the immunity a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d freedome from yeelding account, and to bee in the office of Magistrates for tearme of life, is a greater preheminence then they are worthy of: and it is a dangerous venter, least they exercise their office, not according to the written law, but according to their owne wils and discretions. Though the people being dispoiled of this prerogatiue of hauing any part in the soueraigne Magistrateship, doe keepe themselues quiet, yet is that no token that the Law in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe is good, for the Cosmi haue no such meanes to gaine as the Ephores: but by reason they dwel in an Island, are farre from such aduersaries, as might suborne them with bribes. Also the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> that they apply to this inconuenience is absurd, and not ciuil, but rather sauouring of the power or authority of one or of a few, which is called a Dinastie or Potentateship. For the Cosmi are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten driuen away by their companions and fellowes in office, or some perticular persons rebelling. Also they are at liberty to giue ouer their offices before the expiration of their tearmes. All these <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> things might be better done according to Law then after mens wils, which is no sure rule. But the greatest mischeefe therin, is the disorder often committed by the mightiest, when they wil not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themselues to the order &amp; correction of iustice. Whereby it may be vnderstood, that this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order hath I know not what of a Commonweale, and yet is not a Commonweale, but rather a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastie or Potentateship. They haue accustomed when they see the people in an vprore, and friendes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> diuided to commit the authority to one alone, and so to stirre sedition and fight one with another: Which is nothing els, but in time to bring to passe, that such a City shall bee no City, and that the ciuile society shall bee dissolued and taken cleane away. During which tumults, the whole estate is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> in danger, if there were any that could or would inuade the same. But it is preserued (as wee haue said) by the scituation of the place, which defendeth strangers from approching thereunto. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> the Perioecians are obedient, and contrariwise the Ilotians often reuolt. For the Cretans doe not command and rule out of the Isle: and of fresh remembrance forraine warre hath entered in there, which hath plainely bewraied the weakenesse of their Laws. Thus much shall suffice for this Commonweale.</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/>
               </p>
               <p>Plato, Aristotle, Xenophon, Callisthenes, Ephorus, and diuers other Greek Authors in conferring the Commonweale of Crete with the Lacedemonian, haue written, that they were welneere both alike. Which Polybius refuteth in the sixt booke of his histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, shewing their difference. First, in that amongst the Lacedemonians it was not lawful for one to bee a greater landed man then another, but euery one was to haue an equall portion of lands of the signorie. Contrary thereto, in Crete, euery man was allowed by the law to possesse as much of the Country as hee could come by, without any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of limitation. For by the amplenesse of possessions, excellency was esteemed and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> discerned amongst them. So that the greatest and amplest possession, howsoeuer it was gotten, was in great estimation: and they deemed no manner of getting whatsoeuer, to be blame-worthy. Secondly, in Lacedemon, the kings enioyed their state for euer, and they whom they called elders, were for terme of life, by whom and with whome all the affaires of the Commonweale were managed. In Crete, their manner of gouernement was annuall and Democraticall. Thirdly, as there be two meanes needfull for the conser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of euery Commonweale, namely, power and force against the enemies, and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall agreement betweene Citties and Countrimen: Lycurgus in Lacedemon had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided for both together, by ridding away couetousnesse, that causeth all ciuill discord <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> and sedition. But there were no people in all the whole world that liued in greater mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinies, murders, and ciuill warres, then the Cretans, by reason of their naturall coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse. Further, there is no such craftie liuing priuately to bee found, nor so many for so many, more vniust enterprises, as among the Cretans: wherefore Polybius conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, That their Commonweale was not like the Lacedemonian Commonweale, nor worthy to be compared with it, or imitated of others: For (sayth he) it may be easily iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:7218:78"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> when a Commonweale is wholly out of order and depraued, as wel by the lawes, as by the maners of liuing, and by seeing the inhabitants and subiects of the same, giuen without measure to couetousnesse, and their publicke actions vniust.</p>
               <p>FOR <hi>the report goeth, that Lycurgus.</hi>] It hath been already recited, how Lycurgus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> he gaue laws to the Lacedemonians, dwelt a great while in Crete, where he learned that manner of gouernement in the Island which was ordained by Minos, whence hee borrowed many articles, vsing correction in some, and moderation in other some, by which meanes he made his Commonweale perfecter then that of Minos. Strabo in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> tenth booke of his Geographie hath the like speech.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>Lictians.</hi>] Licte was a town of Crete, &amp; the Lictians inhabitants of the same, who <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> had ben sent thither by the Lacedemonians to dwel there as a colony, as the old custome was, which Lyctians in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuance of time became Cretans, and tooke lawes of Minos.</p>

                  <hi>Minos.</hi>] Plato reasoning of the nature and definition of the lawe, hath intituled that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Dialogue by the name of Minos, where he reciteth certaine places of Homer in his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>THIS <hi>Island hath such a scituation as is naturall and fit to rule.</hi>] The scituation of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Island of Crete was very fit to command all Greece, as the scituation of Italy is to pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse the Empire of the world, being enuironed with the vpper &amp; nether sea, with many other commodities recited by Pliny in the 6. chapter of his 3. book, &amp; by Virgil in the 2. booke of his Georgikes.

affaires &amp; Magistrateships, to answere directly in all points one to another in diuers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> places, and at diuers seasons. Strabo in his tenth booke of the description of the earth, imitating Ephorus the Hystoriographer, who had written of the Commonweales of Europe, reciteth some principall points of the Commonweale of Crete: The first, that liberty is a great welfare and commodity to Citties, &amp; that they ought to be wholly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed about the maintenance therof, because it onely maketh goods proper to the ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and possessors, &amp; that the goods of the thrals and bondmen doe not belong to the obeiers, but to the commanders. That for the keeping of this liberty, concord was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, which is contrary to sedition, that springeth from delicious liuing and couetousnes: and therefore, that if all the Citizens liue modestly and soberly; enuy, reproch, &amp; hatred <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> should not hurt them. For this cause were children incontinently sent to the assemblies of their equals, called bands or troupes, marching day by day, band against band, with Flute and with Harpe, and fighting according to the patterne of very warres: The eldest went to the feasts, where the rich were entreated like the poore, and all serued with one kind of meat. That for the keeping of them from faintheartednesse in trauel, and in feats of armes, they were accustomed from their youth to exercises &amp; battels made for plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, that they might learne to care little for heat and cold, for sharpnesse &amp; hardnesse of life, and for blows and wounds. They doe exercise shooting and leaping in armour, after the Perichian fashion, wearing a coat of armor, and shoes vsed in the wars, with measu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> pacing, melody, &amp; tuning, insomuch, that their plaies &amp; pastimes brought a certaine martial co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modity. Strabo who was a Cretan, &amp; liued vnder Augustus Caesar, wrote that a few of these things continued in his time, wherin all was gouerned by the statutes and edicts of the Romans, as it is at this day by the ordinance of the Venetians.</p>

For such is the lust and wrath of the Magistrate, that turneth the best men out of the right way: But the law is an vnderstanding without affection and lust. And in the booke of the World directed to Alexander vnder the name of Aristotle, the Authour affirmeth, that he had found nothing whereto he could liken God, sauing to the old law of a Citty wel gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> as who would say: That God in this vniuersity of causes, was nothing els but that which the ancient law in a ciuill society is: whereby wee may learne, that it is good and behoofefull, that some thing more diuine then man, doe beare a stroke in the ordering and moderation of the assemblies and companies of men. For when this charge is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to man, the businesse goeth forward with very great daunger, because there are few men to be found which are adorned with wisdome, goodnesse and valour, who very often through force and violence of affections, doe erre in giuing iudgement, and swarue a great deale from reason. It is better therefore to commit such authority to the Lawes, then to men. But forasmuch as Lawes are generally written, and cannot <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> prouide for all perticular cases, it is needfull to haue recourse to men, and to establish some of them as keepers and ministers of the Lawes. This is the resolution which hath been made in this graue matter by many wise personages that haue beene instructed by the experience of many things, and by the inuention of others, and haue conferred di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse copies and patternes together.</p>

If then the election that is made accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to richesse, pertaine to the Oligarchie, and that which is made in respect of vertue, belong to the Aristocratie: this should be a third kind or forme of gouernement which the Carthaginians vse in their Commonweale. For with these two respects doe they chuse their Magistrates, yea the highest that they haue, as their kings and the generals of their armies. Which breach or trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> of the Aristocratie or gouernment by the best sort, is to be laid to their lawgiuers charge, who at the first ought to haue prouided and taken order for this, as a most necessary point, that good men might liue in peace, without committing any vndecent thing in the state, as wel of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrateship, as of a priuate life. For though a care must be had of riches for rest and quietnes sake, yet is it a bad thing, that the greatest offices, as the kingly state, and the authority of the warres, should be saleable and bought for mony: For this law procureth richesse to be more esteemed then vertue, &amp; maketh the whole City couetous, by reason that whatsoeuer is in estimation of the cheefe personages of a countrey, the same is necessarily followed by others: Then where vertue is not cheefly honoured, there can be no assurednesse of the gouernment of the best sort. It is probable,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> that the buyers of offices doe accustome to make a gaine of them, sith they come to them with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>harge: so is it not credible, that a poore and honest man would seeke after gaine, and a dishonest and worse man that had disbursed money for his office, would not gaine it again with aduantage. Therefore should they onely desire Magistrateships that can exercise them with vertue and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightness<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. And though the Lawgiuer despised the pouertie of good men, yet notwithstanding hee ought to haue prouided for the quietnes of the Magistrates. Againe, that one man should exercise many offices, it seemeth a disordered and vnconuenient thing, and yet is accounted honorable &amp; glorious amongst the Carthaginians. For one worke is best done by one man: wherein the Lawgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer should haue set an order, and prohibited that one man should be both a minstrell and a shoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> Therfore where the City is not small, it is more Citie-like and Commonweale like, and more agreeable to the people to communicate the Magistrateships to many.

In which two charges almost all persons doe obserue one t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Furthermore, whereas the forme of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweale doth resemble the Oligarchie, yet notwithstanding they do very aptly auoid this incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience; when euermore some part of the people is enriched whilst they send others to inhabite their smaller Townes.

The sea lay on the one side of this peece, and a great pond of standing seawater called <hi>Mare mort<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> with a single wall which was scited and ioined by many rockes, stretching from one to another. On the other side, in the main land shooting toward the South, higher then the point, stood the castle called Byrsa, &amp; the greatest part of the towne enclosed with three wals, containing euery of them thirty cubites in height, not comprising therein the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rets and galleries that were in the top. These wals stood about two acres one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, within euery of which spaces, there were foure streetes a peece, and the same wals went thirty foot deepe into the ground. The first loft wherof, was at the bottome within the ground, and contained roumth for three hundred Elephants, besides garners for the stoage of necessaries for their keeping. Ouer them were the horsestables, containing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> roumth for foure thousand horses, &amp; garners to keep their prouision in besides: &amp; fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, there were chambers for the lodging of twenty thousand footmen, &amp; foure thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand horsmen. All this prouision in time of wat was bestowed in that place between the three wals:<note place="margin">The Arsenal of Carthage.</note> But at the end of the said long &amp; narrow peece of land whereof we haue spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken that lieth between the sea and the pond, there was for want of a wal a point that tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned toward the hauen which was very low &amp; weake, by reason there had ben no account made of it at the beginning. Nowe the ponds on the land side were nauigable from one to another, &amp; had the entry of the sea about threescore and ten footes broad, which was shut vp with chaines of yron. The Merchants ships lay cheefly in this place, &amp; therefore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> there were a great number of cables &amp; great ropes kept there to tie their ships. Within these ponds there was a very great hall, that was seuered from the ponds, &amp; builded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on certain rocks, standing high among their ponds, betweene the which there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny harbours &amp; places of receit for ships, like an Arsenall, that sufficed to hold &amp; hide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue two hundred ships, &amp; ouer the same were garners &amp; lofts to lay the ships muniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on &amp; furniture in: the whole being like a porch or hall standing vpon pillers of marble stone, to wit, euery seuerall harbor or place of receit for the ships vpon foure pillers, so that the water was vnderneath like a pond, &amp; building ouer, all of one height in form of an Arsenal: &amp; also more forward in the top of all the building was the captains lodging, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> which had at the dore a cabine, out of which he might see the whole Arsenal on al sides, and to the sea, &amp; might from thence command all the mariners, as seemed good to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: &amp; yet they that were on the sea could not see what was done within the Arsenal, how quickesighted soeuer they were, nor the Marchants that arriued in the hauen, for it was inclosed with two wals of such height, as that they hid it al, and there were certain gates which led all incommers, from the end of the hauen into the City, &amp; not toward the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senall. This City was builded &amp; founded in Lybia by the Phoenicians, fifty years before the destruction of Troy, and Chorus and Carchedon did lay the foundation of it, or else queene Dido, as the Romanes &amp; Carthaginians themselues affirme. This Dido (after the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> tyrant Pigmaleon who reigned in the Citty of Tire, had by treason murdered her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band Sichee) departed from thence, being admonished thereto by certaine visions in dreames, togither with many burgesses of the Citty who could not indure Pigmaleons tyranny, and carried with her as much gold and siluer as she could gather togither, and so ariued in Libia, in the place where Carthage was after builded, &amp; perceiuing that the people of the country would driue her away, she entreated the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to giue her as much land to dwell in as an oxe hide would compasse, whereat the men of the countrey tooke vp a laughter at the first, by reason of the smalnes of the thing which she required.

Then these Tyrians did cut an ox hide into so many small thongs, as that it compassed about that place wherein the castle of Carthage after stood,<note place="margin">The beginning and encrease of the Empire of Carthage.</note> which by reason thereof was called Byrsa.

conquered Scicily, Sardinia, with al the other Islands in that sea, &amp; sent part of their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> to inhabite in Spaine: By which meanes, of a small beginning, there grewe an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire &amp; Princedome, that for power might be compared to the Empire of the Grecians, and for riches to that of the Persians. They had kings, and the Aristocraticall power of Senatours, and gaue to the Communalty their preheminences in matters to them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taininge wherein their Commonweale resembled the Lacedemonian state. Their exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise was cheefly in sea matters, wherefore they cared for no footmen, but gaue some or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for horsemen, because they were serued with strangers and hirelings. Nowe, when they had liued in this sort about seuen hundred yeares, the Romanes warred vpon them, and tooke from them in the first punicall warres, the Islands of Scicily and Sardinia,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> and after in the second, all Spaigne. By reason whereof, the Carthaginians assembled a great army vnder the conduct of Hanniball their Captaine generall, and occupied and spoiled the greatest part of Italie by the space of sixteene yeares. On the other side, the Romanes vnder the conduct of Cornelius Scipio the first, spoiled and occupied all the Country of Libia euen to the Cittie of Carthage, tooke their shippes and elephants, and brought them to such extremity, as that they were constrained to pay them a yeare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tribute. Whereupon they made truce the second time, which continued about fiftie yeares, vntill such time as it was broken: at what time the third warres began, wherein vnder the conduct of Scipio the younger, Carthage was wholly destroyed by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> It is reported of this Scipio, that beholding this Citie, which for the space of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen hundred yeares from the building thereof, had so flourished and excelled in all things, and had the dominion of so many seas, lands, and Islands: which in ships, riches, and armour, was comparable to any other, and in boldnesse and hardinesse passed all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and had so valiantly defended her libertie by the space of three yeares after shee had yeelded vp all her weapons and defences, and was at the last through famine and warres come to this extreame necessitie, he wept and shed teares for very pitty: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he gaue sufficient notice, that hee well knewe how all Citties, Countries, and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, were subiect to change of fortune, euen as euery particular man is.

                  </gap> and Rome then in her growing vigour and force. For all Commonweales haue a certaine naturall aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation and quickening, and consequently a decay and diminishing. For then did Rome flourish in the forme of her Commonweale. The people in Carthage had vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped too great authority in their counsels. At Rome the Senate had the direction of the most part of matters of state, which prospered the better, for that they were gouerned by the wisest sort: and by that direction, at last they ouercame the Carthaginians. Adde also, that the Italians were indued with a more excellent nature then the Lybians, as wel in force of body, as in hardinesse of courage; And that the Romanes serue their turnes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> with their owne Nation, whom they traine and bring vp in warlike skill, in the best sort that is vsed in all the whole world: The Carthaginians vsed none but strangers and hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, in whome they reposed all their confidence. Whereof they were euill apaid in the end: And at their first warres with the Romanes, they ruled ouer the people of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica with too great tyrannie and couetousnesse, because they thought they had good cause so to doe, insomuch, that they yearly leauied the one halfe of their fruits.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> they doubled their tribute, and shewed no mercie to them that had offended through ignorance. They bestowed the Magistrateships, not vpon them that were gentle and mercifull persons, but vpon them that augmented the publicke treasures, though they played the Tyrants with the people. Which crueltie and rigour was the cause that in their ciuill warres with Matho and Speudons, not onely the men, but also the women of euery Cittie did conspire, who had afore seene their children and husbands led into thraldome, because they had not payed the tribute; which women were content to sell their iewels to furnish the paiment of the souldiours.</p>

                  <hi>OF them that haue entreated of Commonweales, some neuer had the managing and guiding of publicke affaires, but euermore did lead a priuate life: and wee haue spoken almost of as many of them as haue set downe any thing worthy the remembring. Others haue ben Lawgiuers, some in their owne Cities, others in strange Cities. Of these, some haue ben only Authours of lawes, others founders of Commonweales: as for example, Lycurgus and Solon, who stablished both laws and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weales. The Commonweale of the Lacedemonians hath been spoken of. As for Solon, some think hee was a vertuous Law-giuer, and abrogated the Oligarchie (being then very immoderate and vnreasonable) and deliuered the people from thraldome, and established the Democratie or popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> state according to the old manner, by temperating and ordering the Commonweale aright. For the counsell in the Areopage pertaineth to the Oligarchie; and the election of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> to the Aristocratie: and the forme of the iudgements is popular. Now it seemeth that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon did not take away these two things which were afore time, to wit, the counsell and the election of the Magistrates, but made the people lord by creating them Iudges of all things. Therefore some men find fault with him for that he ouerthrew the other part of the Commonweale by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the authority of all things to Iudges, which were made by casting of lots. For since that course was taken, they that carried fauour with the people as a Tyrant, haue brought the state in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to such a Democratie, as it remaineth in at this present. Ephialties and Pericles brake the lims of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the counsell of Areopage. The same Pericles also ordained fees for the iudges: so euery one that sought fauour and credite at the peoples hands, haue augmented the authority of the people so far, that they haue brought the Commonweale into that forme of Democratie, or gouernmnt by the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> multitude, wherein it nowe remaineth. Notwithstanding, that seemeth not to haue beene Solons meaning, but rather to haue happened by chance and accident. For when the people had been the occasion of the sea victorie in the warres against the Medes, they wexed haughtie-minded, and tooke to themselues leud Oratours in steed of good gouernours. For Solon had giuen authoritie to the people to create, correct, and reforme the Magistrates, as a most necessary thing: which au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority being taken out of their hands, they must needs become thrals, and enemies to the state. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> He ordained, that none should beare office, but such noble and rich men, as could leuie yearely fiue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> hundred bushels out of their lands and reuenues, and of the Zeugites, and of them of the third order called knights.

They of the mountaine ledde a popular life: Contrariwise, they of the plaine, wished that a small number of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test burgesses should haue all the authority in matters of state: and the sea-faring men wishing a meane and mixt gouernement of both, were an impediment, that none of the contrary sides could ouercrow the other. Againe, at the same time the controuersie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the poore and the rich proceeding from vnequality, was at the hottest point. By which meanes, the Cittie was in most eminent danger, insomuch, that there was no likelihood howe these controuersies could bee compounded and pacified, vnlesse some <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> Tyrant rose vp, tooke possession of the Monarchie, and made himselfe soueraigne lord. For all the common people were so farre in debt to the richer sort, that either they til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led their lands, and payed them a sixt part of the profites, or borrowed money of them for vsurie vpon the pawne of their proper persons, and when they wanted ability to pay, were adiudged and condemned to their creditors, who possessed and vsed them as thrals and slaues in their houses, or els sold them into strange Countries. There were many that through pouertie were constrained to sell their owne children, hauing no lawe to the contrary, or els to forsake both Cittie and Countrey by reason of the hardnesse and crueltie of the creditors that were vsurers: till at the last diuerse of the actiuest &amp; stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> persons ioyned themselues together, and encouraged one another to suffer this no longer, but rather to chuse some Captaine among them, being an vpright and faithfull man, not onely to deliuer them from captiuitie that were condemned to thraldome and slauerie for want of payment of their debts at the daies appointed, but also to diuide all the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then the wisest sort of the Cittie considering that only Solon was blamelesse, as hee that tooke no part with the iniquitie and violence of the rich, nor with the neede of the poore, entreated him to vndertake the dealing in the affaires of the Commonweale, for the appeasing and ending of all these partialities. Hee at the first was verie doubtfull to take the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> matter vpon him, fearing the couetousnesse of the one sort, and the pride and arrogan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the other. Notwithstanding, at last hee was chosen Prouost, and withall, media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour and reformer of the Lawes, and of the whole state of the Commonweale, by the good liking and consent of both parties: for the rich liked him well because hee was not needie, and the poore allowed of him because hee was honest and vpright. In which matters hee after guided and behaued himselfe so constantly, that hee neither yeelded for feare of the mightier, nor framed his Lawes to the liking and will of them that had chosen him reformer. Also hee did not cut off the wound at the quicke, nor altered the state in such sort as had beene most expedient. Fearing least if hee had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> to haue altered and turned the whole gouernement of the Citty vpside down, hee should after haue lacked sufficient power to settle and stablish it in the best forme. Therefore did hee onely alter what hee hoped either by reason to persuade, or by force to make the Cittizens to accept, by matching force and iustice together: yet when they elected him generall reformer of the whole state of the Commonweale, they had not limitted his power and authoritie, but indifferently committed all thinges to his discretion, as the Magistrateships, the publicke assemblies in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, the voices and suffrages in election of Officers: the iudgements, the body of the Senate, with authoritie and power to determine and limite what possessions euery <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> of them ought to haue, what number they should bee, and howe long they should stay in office, and to retaine, confirme, or cancell what hee thought good in the old lawes and customes which were in vse and practise.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> THE <hi>counsell in the Areopage, perteineth to the Oligarchie.</hi>] The most part of Authors <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> hold opinion, that Solon stablished the court of the Areopages, whereof there seemeth a great testimony, in that Draco in his lawes maketh no mention of the Areopages in any place, but alwaies where he speaketh of murders and death of men, he directeth his speech to the Ephetes, who were criminall Iudges. Notwithstanding, the eight lawe of Solons thirteenth table, saith thus in these proper tearmes:
<q>They that were banished or noted of infamie before Solon established his lawes, shall bee restored to their goods and good name, except those that were condemned by sentence of the court of Areo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page, or by the Ephetes, or by the kings, in the place of audience of the pallace, and in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the towne-house, for murder and death of men, or for aspiring to vsurpe tyrannie.</q> These words seeme to proue, that the court of Areopage was erected before Solon was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen reformer of the Lawes. For how could any offenders haue been condemned by sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the court of Areopage before Solons time, if Solon were the first that gaue it authoritie to iudge of matters? Except they will say, that the letter of the law which is darke must be holpen, and somewhat supplied therein that wanteth, by giuing such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation as followeth vnto it, to wit, They that shall bee attainted and conuict of any matter whereof the court of Areopage, the Ephetes, or gouernours of the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie haue the hearing and determination, vpon the publishing of this lawe, shall remaine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> condemned, and all others shall bee released and restored. This Court and Counsell of Areopage was composed of them that are yeerely chosen Prouosts of the Cittie: Of the which number, Solon himselfe was. But when hee perceiued how the people were fierce and bold, by reason they felt themselues discharged of their debts, he erected ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther second counsell for matters of state, chusing a hundred men of euery tribe, foure of the which had the charge to consult and debate of matters, before they were deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the people, to the end, that vpon the assemblie of the great counsel, there should no matter be put forth that had not been first well debated and considered in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of foure hundred. Further, he ordained that the soueraine court should haue an eye <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and ouersight in all thinges, specially concerning the maintenance, obseruation, and keeping of the lawes: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Some men affirme, that Onomacritus was the first that had skill to make lawes, and that hee being of Locres, and dwelling in Crete, exercised himselfe in this faculty, at what time hee professed southsaying: Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les had been his scholler, Lycurgus and Zaleucus were hearers of Thales: and Charondas, of Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leucus.

At this day their sepulchres are to bee shewed in the view one of another: Howbeit, in such sort, that the one may be seen of Corinth, and the other not. And they report, that this buriall was thus foreappointed by them, to wit, by Diocles, because he would not be seene of Corinth, in despite of his misfortune, and by Philolas to the contrary, for that hee would bee seene. Well, they dwelt vpon this occasion amongst the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banes, to whome Philolas gaue lawes in diuerse things, and specially concerning the generation of children. Which lawes they called positiue lawes, and prouided specially, that the number of inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritances <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4.5"/> should bee maintained. Charondas hath limitted nothing specially, but iudgements a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> false witnesses, and was the first that made a law in that behalfe. Further, he is more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and more exquisit in his laws, then the lawgiuers of this age. Philolas hath proper to himself the inequality of possessions: Plato to himselfe the community of women, children, and goods, and the meetings of women at meat and meales: And further, the lawe touching drunkennesse, and that maisters of feasts should be sober: Also martiall exercises, and the practise to doe good with both hands, as if it were an vnseemely thing, that one hand should bee profitable, and the other vnprofitable. Moreouer, there bee certaine lawes of Draco found, that hee made for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweale <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> after it was stablished: and hath nothing proper to himselfe that is greatly worth the remembring, sauing rigour in the greatnesse of punishment.

When diuerse men say the Citie hath done some act, and others say, not the citie, but the Oligarchie, or the Tyrant hath done it. Nowe wee see that the whole charge and businesse of a politicke man, or of a Lawgiuer, doth consist in a citie, and that the forme of gouernment of a citie, is the order of the inhabitants of the same. Sith therefore a citie is a thing compounded, and consisting of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse parts, as any other whole thing; we will first speake of a Citizen. For whereas a citie is a

multitude of Citizens, it is expedient to learne, who ought to bee called a Citizen, and who is a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> right Citizen, for as much as often that matter commeth into question, by reason all men doe not vnderstand it after one sort.

Where therefore that kind of libertie is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> graunted vnto them, they ought not to bee called Citizens absolutely, but after a certaine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> sort: as children, who by reason of their age are not yet enrolled, and olde men exempted from publicke charges and offices, whome wee call not Citizens simply, but with some addition, tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

But the true and right Citizen, cannot bee defined more properly than by hauing interest and participating in the publicke power and authoritie of iudging, and of bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> the office of Magistrateship in his City. Of Magistrateships, some bee limitted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined by time, insomuch, that it is not lawfull for one man to obtaine them twice, at least, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept there bee some space limitted and passed betweene both times. The others bee without limitation, as the Iudge and Counseller: Peraduenture it will be obiected, that they are no Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates, though it bee ridiculous, and contrary to reason to say they haue no interest in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrateship, who bee of most authority. But let vs not stand on this, sith the question is but about the bare name. For the charge which is common to the Iudge and Counsellor hath no name, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any word fit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>or them both. Therefore for distinctions sake, wee will call it the indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Magistrateship. Herevpon wee ordaine and limit them for Citizens that haue this interest <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> and participation: wherefore that definition of a Citizen, which may most fitly bee applied to all them that are called Citizens, is almost of this sort: notwithstanding, we should not bee ignorant, that in those things wherein subiects differ in part or degree, and the one is first, the other second, another after, there is little or no community or fellowship at all amongst them, as they be of that kind &amp; sort. As for Commonweales, they also differ in kind from each other<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Forasmuch therefore as the Citizen differeth according to euery Commonweale,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> it followeth that the Citizen aforelimitted is cheefly in the Democratie, or popular state: yet may hee bee also in other Commonweales, but that is not of necessitie: for in some of them, the people hath no such authority, neither is there any vse of publicke assemblies: but the Senatours serue the turne, and decide causes seuerally. As in Lacedemon, the Ephores or controullers doe heare and determine contracts and bargaines, and other Magistrates other matters: the Senatours manslaughters, and peraduenture euery Magistrate some seuerall matter. The like order is in Carthage, where certaine Magistrates decide all causes. But the definition of a Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen dooth receiue correction, because in other Commonweales the authoritie of the iudge and Counsellor, is not indefinite and without limitation, but definite and limitted according to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> Magistrateship. For it is graunted to all or some of them, to deliberate, to counsell, and to iudge, either of all, or certaine affaires. It appeareth now by the premisses, who is a Citizen: For who so hath meane to come to the authoritie of counselling and iudging: him say wee to bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie a Citizen of this Citie: and a Citie, to speake simply; I call such a multitude of those Citizens, as is sufficient to liue of it selfe. Some men hauing an eye to custome, doe define him for a Citizen that is borne of father and mother, that be Citizens; and not of one Citizen alone,

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> as of the father, or of the mother, othersome seeke higher, as to two or three Grandfathers, or mo degrees.

Gorgias the Leontine, partly doubting and partly scoffing, said, that like as morters be made by their workemen, so the Laryssyans were made by their ingendrers, and that there were some makers of Laryssyans. But this is too fond and grossely spoken, for if they communicated of the commonweale in the manner a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>orementioned, they should be Citizens. But they being borne of a father that is a Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, or of a mother, cannot be applied to the first inhabitants or founders of a Citie: but the greatest doubt is about them that haue bene admitted by reason of any alteration and change <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that hath happened in a Cittie: as Clisthenes did at Athens, after he had driuen out the tyrans.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> For he receiued many strangers and bondmen into the tribes, of whome it may be doub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Wherein it may also be doubted, whether who so is not iustly a citizen, be not a citizen, as if vniust and false were all one. But forasmuch as we see some personages behaue themselues vniustly in Magistrateships, whome neuertheles we call Magistrates, and yet not iustly: and for that a Citizen is defined in regard of some Magistrateship (sith he to whome the Magistrateship may be imparted, is called a citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen as hath bene declared) doubtles these men also ought to be called citizens, whether it be iustly or vniustly, that is to be referred to the former question, where it is demaunded whether a Citie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> hath done or not done any thing, as when it is changed from an Oligarchie or tyranny into a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If then some men do thus demeane themselues in the popular state, it must needes be said that the acts of such a Citie are no otherwise publique, than if they were of an oligarchie and a tyrannye.</hi>

                  </gap>ateship: and a Citie, the multitude of men, to whome the commonweale is thus communicated, hauing plentie of all things as well necessarye as commodious. Which definition of a citizen cannot well be applied to all the citizens of all cities, but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to those that haue a popular gouernement, wherein they being equall, are gouerned by assemblies, where euery of them hath libertie to say his opinion. Two other defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a citizen are reiected: the one, that a citizen is who so is borne both of father and mother that be citizens: the other that a citizen is who so is engendred of father and mother being citizens, whose grandfather, great grandfather, and other aunce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors haue bene citizens. Also two doubts are resolued, the one touching them that are newly admitted and made citizens at any alteration in a state, whether they be iustly or vniustly created. The other whether who so is vniustly made a citizen, ought to be accoumpted a citizen. The whole conclusion is, that who soeuer in any maner <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> of gouernement whatsoeuer may beare office &amp; exercise any Magistrateship, is accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Citizen, as the naturall Frenchmen be in the realme of France, of whome there is none so mean, of how base degree soeuer he be, but he may be aduanced to worship and honor for his valliancy, or be preferred to the cheefest ecclesiasticall dignities, or to the highest offices of iustice or of the princes reuenues by his skilfulnesse &amp; vncorrupt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour, as hath ben declared in the first booke.

As Rome was not alwaies gouerned after one sort, so was not the name of a Cittizen alwayes taken in one sence: For while the first kings had the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, the common people were clearely shut out from all honours and Magistrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships; but after the kingly State was once changed into a Commonweale, the people were admitted to the Magistrateships, and ordering of publicke affaires, and to bee as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistant in the publicke assemblies that were made in the field of Mars, and in Tribes, Courts, Orders, and Censuries, for the deliberating and consulting of the affaires of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> the Commonweale by voices and suffrages, for the creating of Magistrates, and for the ordaining of new Lawes; where hee was accounted for a right Cittizen that was free, hauing a family and tribe, with power to attaine to any degree of worship and honour, and enioying many priueledges and prerogatiues. But after the dominion was once vsurped by the Emperours, those publicke assemblies were onely continued vnder Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Caesar, and Octauius Augustus, and after abrogated by Tyberias, who tooke from the people the authoritie of intermedling in publicke affaires, and transferred it to the Senate, and to the absolute power of the Prince, as appeareth in Sigonius his booke of the auncient law of the Cittizens of Rome, and in Gruchius his booke of the publicke <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> assemblies of the Romanes.</p>

No child was accounted for a man, vntill hee came to the age of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenteene <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> yeares, that he left wearing a childs gowne, and tooke on him mans garment. At Venice all the young men descending from the order of the Senatours and Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and being aboue the age of twenty yeares, vse to resort to the Magistrates called the Aduocators, to whome the guardiance and defence of the lawes is cheefly commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: before which Magistrates, they must come with their father or mother: if the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be dead, then with the next of their kin: if the father and mother be deceased, then with two witnesses of good credite, and proue that they are borne of lawfull marriage, and of a mother both godly and honest. The witnesses take an oath, that they know it to be so by the testimony of many folke, whom they knowe. This being done, the father or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> mother, or next of kin (if the young man haue neither father nor mother) declare vpon their oaths, that the yong man is aboue the age of twenty yeares. All this being written in a common booke by the secretary of the Magistrate, they stay for the fourth day of December, at which day the names of all these young men that through the benefite of the lot haue not obtained the right of a Citizen, nor exceed the age of 25 years, are cast into an earthen pot, or some other like thing, and so brought before the prince &amp; coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellers, where the same pot is set by another pot, wherin there be as many lots, as names written in little bils in the other: The fift part of the lots are guilded, &amp; all the rest of sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.

But if it happen to be a siluer lot, he loseth his right for that time, &amp; must tarry another year, except in the mean space he exceed his age of 25 years. For all they that descend of the order of the Senators &amp; noblemen (whom according to the vulgar Italian tongue, wee may call Patricians) as soone as they attaine to that age, haue a Cittizens right,

                     </gap> case a Citie is to be called, the same, or not the same, but another: that is, whether he may be cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged or no. The cheef resolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this doubt consisteth in the place, and in the men. For the place may be seuered, and the men also, &amp; some may dwell in one place, &amp; others in another, which is but a sleight doubt: for in as much as a City is taken and vnderstoode <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> diuerse waies, this question is easie. Likewise, where as men doe inhabite one place, how long and how far a City is to be deemed the same: which is not to bee measured by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the wals, for a wall might be made round, about all Pelops Isle. Such peraduenture is Babilon, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> euery other City that is liker a Nation then a towne. For when Babilon was taken by the enemies, it is reported, that one part thereof knewe nothing of the taking till the third day after. Wee will reason hereof in another place more conueniently. For who so is apt to gouerne a City, ought not to be ignorant concerning the greatnesse of the City, both how great it should bee, and whether it be expedient to haue one Nation or moe therein: and whether while the same inhabitants dwell in one place, it is to bee called the same as long as the same kind of gouernement shall last, though one sort incessantly die, and another continually succeed: as we haue accustomed to call floods and riuers the same, and fountaines and springs the same, notwithstanding that euermore one water <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> commeth and another goeth: or whether shall we call the men the same for such cause, and the towne diuers: for if a City bee a certaine society, and this society is made of Citizens: when the Commonweale falleth into another forme or shape, and becommeth of another stampe, it should seeme necessary, that the city were no more to bee called the same, as wee say, that the quier <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> or Chorus being one while comicall, and another while tragicall, are diuers, though it often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist of the selfesame persons, and so of euery other fellowship and composition: as wee say, a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the same voice is another, when sometimes it goeth after the Dorian manner,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:7218:87"/>
and nowe and then after the Phrygyan fashion. If it bee thus, it appeareth that a Citie is to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> the same, in respect of the Commonweale, and that it may bee called by another name, or the same, whilest the same inhabitants remain in it, or altogether others that are diuerse from them: but whether it bee lawfull and meet or no, when the forme of a City is wholly changed, to pay or not to pay our debts, it belongeth to another place to discusse of.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Aristotle taking occasion vpon the propounded question, (to wit, whether the forme of gouernment being changed, a man is bound to obserue the bargaines and couenants which were contracted before) discourseth howe a Citty when any change or altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion happeneth vnto it ought to be esteemed, one and the same, or another and diuerse:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> for if the change be made onely of the place and scituation, the Towne indeed becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth diuerse, but the Citty remaineth the same. As Pompey at the beginning of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill warre, being retired out of Italy, saied that there was Rome, where the Senate was, and not where the wals were. And during the time that Camillus dwelt at Veyes, it was generally said, that Rome was there also; as if there had not been any change, but of the place onely and habitation, which is changed oftentimes for many and sundrie causes: as wee see how Rome and Lions are nowe built by the riuers sides, which in olde time stood vpon high places, and Ierusalem stands in another place nowe, then it was woont to doe. If the change bee made of men alone, who all in a hundred yeares space die and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> passe away: neuerthelesse, seeing that some thus dying, others still are borne to succeed in their places, the Towne retayning the same forme of gouernement, the Citty also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth one and the same: as the kingdome of Fraunce, and signory of Venice haue continued already eleuen hundred yeares in the same state of policy, albeit the French and Venetian Cittizens haue in this long space ben infinitely changed: after the simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of riuers, which are alwaies the same riuers, although the water is neuer the same, but one runneth away, and other succeedeth in the roome. But when the forme of poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and gouernment of a Commonweale is changed, then becommeth the Citty ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then it was, as not long agoe the signorie of Florence is chaunged into a Duchie,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> the kingdome of Rome into a Commonweale, properly called, and this againe into an Empire. And thus a Cittie may continue one, and the same, though the Towne bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued, ruined, or subuerted: as the Empire of Rome was the same Empire still, euen then when the seat of it was translated from Rome to Constantinople, or when the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of houses and wals was destroyed by the Gothes and Vandales. On the contrary, a Towne may be called by the same name, and be the same indeed, though the Cittizens be changed, and the forme of gouernment quite altered: as may bee said of Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople, out of which the Grecians were driuen and banished by the Turkes, who also haue changed the forme of the Empire. Censorius the Romane Consull declaring to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> the Carthaginians the decree of the Romane Senat concerning the pulling downe and euerting their Citty, and that they should build and erect another in some place eighty furlongs from the sea, said vnto them: That hee did not thinke that the place where the Citty stood was Carthage, but the people: as reporteth Appian Alexander in his book intituled <hi>Libic. cap.</hi> 9.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III. Whether the vertue that belongeth to a good man, be the same with that which belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to a good Citizen.</head>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>AFter the things before mentioned, it followeth consequently that we consider, whether the vertue of a good man and a good Citizen bee one, and the same or no: that is, whether to be a good man is to bee a good Citizen: for the vnderstanding whereof, it is meet first to consider summarily what is the vertue that belongeth to a Citizen. Therefore as a Mariner is one of the fellowship and societie of nauigatours, so a Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen is one of the fellowship and society of ciuill gouernment. Now, albeit that Mariners haue vnlike offices and charges, one drawing at the oare, another holding the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> sterne, and another gouerning the foredecke, or doing some such like work: yet it is manifest, that the perfect definition of euery of them, is to be proper and peculier to his own vertue: and in like manner, there must bee a common definition fitting to them all: for the safety and suretie of say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, is that which belongeth to them all: For this euery Mariner aimeth at, as the cheefe end. In like manner, though the offices of Citizens be vnlike and diuerse, yet the preseruation of ciuill community, belongeth to all. And this community is a Commonweale: wherefore the vertue of a Citizen must needs be referred to the Commonweale. If therefore there bee many kinds of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweales, then surely there cannot be one perfect vertue of a good Citizen, but a good man is he that is endued with perfect vertue, whence it appeareth euidently, that there may be a good Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> in whom is not found that vertue which is required in a good man. Notwithstanding, a man may in doubting manner, otherwise apply this reason, taken from a perfect Commonweale. For if it be impossible that a City should consist of all good men, and if euery one ought to doe his duty in his place vertuously, (for that is vertue to doe ones duty) and againe, if all Citizens cannot bee alike; then it followeth, that the vertue of a good Citizen and of a good man cannot be all one: for the vertue of a good Citizen must be in euery one, for so the reason of a good and perfect City requireth: but the vertue of a good man cannot bee in euery one, except it bee necessary, that all the Citizens of a city be good, which can no wise bee. Moreouer, seeing that a city consisteth of vnlike persons: for example, as a liuing creature, of a body and a soule; and the soule, of reason <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> and appetite: and as a family consisteth of a man and a woman, and possession of a maister and a seruant, after the same manner a City is compounded both of all these, and also of many other vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like kinds: it is impossible that the same vertue should appertaine to all Citizens, no more then in dauncing, the same vertue belongeth to him that leadeth the daunce, and him that followeth. Therefore simply that the same vertue is not of euery good Citizen and good man, it is euident by this: but whether it may be in some perticular Citizen and man, let vs now consider. We vse
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:7218:88"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> to say in common speech, that a good ruler and commander is a good and wise man: and some hold that the institution of a prince and ruler<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ought to differ from that of priuate men, as it is to bee seene in kings children, which are brought vp and exercised in the art of horse-manship &amp; war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare: and Euripides saieth: Giue not to mee these glorious things, but those which the City hath need of: as if there were a peculier discipline for the Prince. But if there the vertue of a good Prince or Magistrate, and of a good man bee the same; and hee which is a subiect, is a Citizen also as well as they, it shall not simply be the same of euery one, but of some onely, because the vertue of a Magistrate and a Citizen do differ. And therfore it may be, Iason said that he was vexed when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e reigned not, as if he knew not how to lead a priuate life: and yet neuerthelesse it is commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to bee able both to rule and to obey well, and it is a vertue in a good Citizen also: If therefore we consider the vertue of a good commander alone, and the vertue of him that knoweth both to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand &amp; obey together, surely both these cannot deserue equal commendation. But because some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it seemeth that both these ought to bee, namely, that the commander and obeyer ought not to learne both the same ver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ues, and that the Citizen ought to know both howe to command and obey, &amp; to enioy them in common, we shall vnderstand concerning this, by that which followeth, what is requisite: for there is a signoriall or maisterly gouernment, and it is not needfull for him which holdeth the same, to know howe to doe things which are called necessary, but rather how to vse them. Another thing also belongeth to the bondslaues, namely to performe seruile workes, &amp; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to be a minister of base trades. Now we say that there are many sorts of slaues, as there are many kinds of seruile workes: in which ranke, all handicraft men are reckoned, that is to say, such as labour with their hands to get their liuing as their name importeth, and with these all base and illiberall artificers. Wherefore in auncient times these kind of people were not pertakers of bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring any publicke office, before that licentious Democratie and sway of the people began to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile. Therefore a good man or a good Citizen ought not to learne nor meddle with such kinde of trades of people so much in subiection, except for their owne particuler vse and practise: for if they should, then there would be no difference betweene the maister and the slaue. Againe, there <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> is another kind of gouernment, by the which, he that is in authority commandeth ouer his like in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> nature, and ouer free men: which gouernment we call Politicall, which a man ought to learne by obeying: Euen as a souldior learneth to lead a troupe of horsemen, by seruing vnder a gen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rall of horsemen, and to be a Centurion or a Corporall, by seruing a captaine of footmen. For which cause it is well said, that he can neuer command well, which hath not first learnt to obey well: but the vertue belonging to both these, is diuerse, and a good Citizen must know and bee able both to obey and to command: and it is the vertue of a Citizen to knowe well to demeane himselfe in both: consequently also both these belong vnto a good man, although I confesse the iustice and temperance of him that commandeth, is of another stampe then the iustice and temperance of him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hat obeyeth: for the vertue of a subiect being free, cannot be the same with the vertue of a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> good man, as iustice for example, but must needs be of two sorts, one of commanding, the other of obeying. Euen as the temperance and fortitude of a man and women doe differ: for a man would be accounted a coward, if he were but so valiant, as the valiantest woman is, and a woman would be accounted a pratler, if shee were but so modest, as an honest and the modestest man may be. Considerng also that the husbandry and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uswifery of man and woman are not all one, for it is his office to get and bring in, and hers to keepe and lay vp. So also wisdome is a vertue proper to the commander, all other vertues are common both to commaunders and obeyers: but wisdome belongeth not to an obeyer, but only a true opinion: for he that is in subiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is like vnto a maker of pipes, and he that is in authority, like vnto him that playeth on the pipes. By this which hath <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> ben deliuered, it is easy to know whether the vertue of a good Citizen be all one and the same: &amp; also how they agree &amp; how they differ: but concerning a Citizen, there remaineth one scruple to be discussed, that is, whether in truth he only be to be reputed a Citizen, which is capable of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick office and Magistracy, or whither artificers and mercenarie tradesmen be Citizens also: for if we call them Citizens which are not capable of any office, it cannot be, that the vertue of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding should belong to all Citizens: but if none of them be Citizens, in what number or ranke are they to bee placed: not in the number of strangers conuersing with vs, nor of enemies fighting
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:7218:89"/>
against vs, or it may be no absurdity will arise hereof, seeing that bondslaues, &amp; enfranchised per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> are not counted amongst them which I mentioned: for this is true, that all those are not to be reckoned in the account of Citizens, without which a City cannot consist, for eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> children are not Citizens after the same maner as men, for these are simply so, those conditionally &amp; by supposition: Citizens indeed they are, but yet imperfect ones. Therfore also in time past in some places, the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary artificers &amp; strangers were accounted bondmen, &amp; therefore now many of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are so also, howbeit, a good City wil neuer admit a mercenary &amp; base artificer into the fre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>dom of it: but if so he be nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred amongst Citizens, sure the vertue which we spake off before, cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to all, nor to a free man only, but to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that abstaine fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> necessary workes: nowe of these, they that minister to one in priuate, are seruants, but they that minister to al in publick<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> are mercenary <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> artificers: but as concerning these things, we shal plainly perceiue how they are, by that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, &amp; it is also manifest by that which hath ben spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> already: for seeing that there are many kinds of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monweales, there must needs be also many kinds of Citizens, especially of obeying Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, so that necessarily the mechanical artificer &amp; mercenary tradesman must be accounted citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens in some Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monweale, &amp; yet no Citizens in others: as for example, in an Aristocratie if there be any such, or in that kind wherin honors &amp; offices are distributed according to vertue &amp; digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: for it is impossible for him to exercise the works of vertue, that occupieth a mechanical &amp; mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary trade. In Oligarchies also a mercenary cannot be a citizen, because men are there admitted to Magistracies in regard of their great and large reuenues, albeit that the mechanicall artificer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> may attain thereunto, by reason that many such grow very rich. There was a law in Thebes, that no man might be receiued into any office of honor, who had not forsaken the traffick of merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise for the space of 10 yeares. In some Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monweales the law admitteth &amp; allureth strangers into the society of citizens: for in some cities where the people bear rule, he that is born of a mother ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tixen, is accounted a citizen, &amp; the same reason is of bastards in many places, but this is for want of legitimated citizens, that they make such as these are, for the scarcity of men was the occasion of all such laws. But as soon as the city is abundantly peopled, they by &amp; by driue out &amp; cut off by little &amp; little: first, those that are born of both parents seruants, next those that haue their fathers slaues but their mothers citizens, and at last admit none into that society, but those that are free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> by both parents. We may therfore hereby perceiue, both that there are many sorts of citizens<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> &amp; also that he principally is to be reputed a citizen, that is capable of publick honors and offices: as Homer brings in a certain stranger despised of Achilles, as a man not pertaker of publick honors. Now if such a thing as this be in any respect hidden and concealed, it is to this end, to delude the inhabitants. Whether therefore the same vertue belongeth to a good man &amp; a good citizen, it is plain by this which is said, as also that in some city it is all one, in others not: &amp; that not in euery citizen, but in a politick citizen, who can alone or together with other gouerne the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monweale.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here a question is propounded whether the vertue of a good cittizen &amp; a good man be one &amp; the same or no: &amp; it is answered that it cannot be the same. First, because there <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> being many formes of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monweales, it is necessary to fit the vertue of a Citizen to the kind of Commonweale wherein he liueth: so that there cannot be one &amp; the same ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of all citizens in all Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monweales. Secondly as a city cannot consist of all good me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and yet all good citizens must be indued with the ciuil vertue, it seemeth in this respect, that the vertue of a good man &amp; of a good citizen cannot be the same. Further, seeing that a city consisteth of vnlike persons, euen as the vertues of those that are thus vnlike must needs be diuers, so it followeth, that the vertue of all cannot be al alike, notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, in a good Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monweale only, the vertue of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is but one: for albeit there be a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vertue required in this also, one to teach men to obey wel, the other to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand wel,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> which latter is greater &amp; more perfect the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the former, for to obey well, are required for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude &amp; temperance, euen so the same are necessary to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand wel, but yet these diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other in kind &amp; nature, though the same in name<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> neuerthelesse, a good citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen &amp; a good man ought to haue the both, although ech of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is called properly good, because of that vertue which is most perfect: but amongst all vertues, wisdome is most fit for a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mander, which is not necessary in an obeyer. This question being thus decided, he returneth to consider of a citizen: &amp; declareth that there are many sorts &amp; kinds ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, where he affirmeth that in well gouerned cities, mechanicall Artsmen &amp; mercenary
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:7218:89"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> persons, being vnfit to exercise the workes of vertue, ought not to bee placed and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued into the ranke and order of true citizens: but that only they are to bee so esteemed which are free and honestly brought vp, capable of offices and publicke honours.

                  <hi>Againe, there is another kind of gouernment by the which he that is in authoritie comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ouer his like in nature, and ouer free men: which gouernment we call Politicall.</hi>] Aristotle in the first and fourth chapters of the first booke of this worke sayth, that Politicall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment is amongst free men and equals: amongst whome euery one that is capable <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and fit to gouerne, is by lot or election called to the publick honors and Magistratships of his Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monweale, for longer or lesser continuance, according to the qualitie of the offices, gouerning and obeying in his place, and by turnes, as the ancient manner was at Athens and at Rome, and now is at Venice, Raguse, Genes, Luke, the free cities of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, the Cantons of Swisserland, the Grisian league, and at Geneua. In like sort also is the Shrieuewicke of Paris, with the Prouostship of the Merchants. The which officers or administrations are changed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 2 years to 2 years by election amongst such as be Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risiens born by father &amp; mother that be Parisiens also. In the vniuersity amongst the stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, the Rector or gouernor, who is changed 4. times a year, &amp; the 4. Proctors of nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> &amp; other like eligible officers, retaine some form of the gouernment of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale. The same author in the last chap. <hi>lib.</hi> 1. Amongst very many gouernments of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweales, the gouernor and obeier are changed by turnes, because they wil be equall according to nature, &amp; differ in nothing. Albeit, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the one gouernes &amp; the other obeies, there is a difference sought, in apparrel, words, &amp; honors. In the 1. chap. of the 2. book, Those things wherof an vnion is made, must differ in kind, in sort, that the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence which is equally made, may preserue the Cities &amp; Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monweales, as it hath been before declared in the books of maners: the which reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pensing of necessity must be kept amongst such as be free and equall, for that they cannot all gouern together, but rather <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> they must gouern by yeares, or some other order of time. By which course it falleth out, that all gouern, like as if the tailors and carpenters did change, and were not alwaies the selfesame. But because in the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monweale gouernement, it is best that things continue as they are, it would be most expedient, that the selfesame men should alwaies gouerne. Notwithstanding, where that cannot bee, because all are equall by nature, it standeth with reason, that all should haue part in gouerning, be it good or bad: following there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in an enterchangeable course by turnes, that such as bee equall, may yeeld place one to another, as those that went afore, gaue place vnto them. Thus some gouern, &amp; some are

In the fourth chap. of this booke hee sayth: That when ciuill offices are distributed according to the equality and parity of the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, then they looke to manage them by turn: First, as nature requireth, euery one wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in his turn to gouerne and looke vnto the profit of another, as another being in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, is careful ouer the good and profite of him.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h chap. of the same book, he saith: That it seemeth to some to be a thing contrary to nature, that one should hold the principality ouer all, where the body of the Citty standeth of equals. For it is necessary, that those which are alike by nature, haue the same honor and dignity accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to nature. If then it be pernicious and hurtfull to the bodie, that men of vnlike dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> vse the selfesame kind of nourishment and attire, so is it in honors, for vnequall honours are not to be giuen to those that are equall. Wherefore none ought more to command then to obey, but there must be an intercourse of both: which truly is lawe, seeing that order is law. At the end of the same chapter, he saith thus: it may bee well ynough vnderstood by that which hath been spoken, that it is neither commodious nor iust, that amongst equals one should haue rule and authority ouer all: neither if there be no laws, but he himselfe stand for the law, neither if there be, neither for a good man ouer them that are good, neither for an euill man ouer men of his condition, except in some respect only. In the 7. book and 14. chap. thus: Seeing that euery society consisteth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> of commanders and obeyers, let vs see whether they ought to change, or alwaies to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in one state. If therefore they did so excell one another as we suppose the gods &amp; Heroes to excel men, and that they do declare this their excellency first by their bodies next by their minds, so that it might be euident and apparant: surely it would be better, that the same men should euer command, and the same alwayes obey: But seeing this is hard to find, it is necessary for many causes, that the right of commanding and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie be indifferently communicated to all. For amongst men of like condition, there should be the like equality.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/>

               <p>
                  <hi>THese things being thus declared, it followeth that we consider <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> whether there ought to be but one forme of pollicy, or more: &amp; if more, what they are and how many, and how they differ one from another. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy therefore is the order and description, as of other offices in a city, so of that which hath the greatest and most soueraine authority for the rule and administration of a Commonweale, hath euermore power and authority ioined with it: which administration is called policie in Greeke, and in English a Commonweale: for example sake, as in a Democratie the authority is in the hands of the people, in an Oligarchie in the hands of a few. Now we call a policy a state di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse from both these, and also from all other formes of gouernment. First, we must suppose where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> a City was ordained, and how many kinds of gouernments there bee amongst men, and in the society of life: wee haue somewhat touched this point already in the forefront of this worke, where we entreated of Oeconomie and maisterly authority, How a man by nature was a ciuil and politicall creature, whence it ariseth, that albeit they should not stand in need of mutuall succour and helpe, yet they would neuerthelesse desire to liue together in ciuill society: yet notwithstanding common profite and vtily gathereth them together, in as much as it is behoofefull for each partie

We see how much euill, &amp; what great calamity many men indure, for this cause only that they might liue; as if there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted in that a certain natural pleasure &amp; delight. Now it is no difficult matter to discern &amp; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish the formes of gouernment aforenamed, for we haue elsewhere in other of our books most clearly &amp; plainely defined &amp; determined thereof. For the maisterly &amp; signiorall gouer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ment, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though indeed it be profitable both to the natural seruant &amp; master, yet neuertheles it aimeth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> at the profit of the master &amp; not of the seruant, but by accident: for it cannot be, that the seruant perishing &amp; sailing, but that the authority of the master do fail also. The regiment of wife &amp; children, &amp; of a family, which we call Oeconomy, tendeth either to the good of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that are in obedience, or of both together. Simply &amp; in it self it respecteth the good of the obeyers, as we see in all other Arts, as Phisicke, &amp; the art of exercising the body: by accident it respecteth the good of the commanders also, for nothing hinders the master of the Art of exercise, but that hee himselfe may be one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that do excercise, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as a Pilot in a ship is alwaies one of the mariners. Therfore the mast<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>r of exercise &amp; the Pilot regard the good of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that are vnder their authority: but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues become one of that number, they are pertakers accidentally, the one of the safetie of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the ship, as he is a mariner, the other of the exercise of the body, as he is an exerciser. Therfore whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ciuil offices are determined &amp; distributed according to the equality of men, they desire to manage the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by turns: first (as Nature directeth) euery one desiring to gouern in his course, &amp; to prouide in his turn for the good of others, as others in their course of gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t prouide for him. Now in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modity which grows from the Commonweale &amp; gouernment, they would alwaies be Magistrates, as if it should come to passe, that those that are sick &amp; diseased, by bearing rule &amp; au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, should alwaies be sound, after which maner Magistratships &amp; offices, would peraduenture be sought for and hunted after. Therfore it is manifest, that all Commonweales which tend to the common good, are simply right and iust, and that those which regard only the profite of superiors, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> are all corrupt and transgressions of the right formes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Policy is the order &amp; disposition of the city in regard of Magistrats, &amp; specially in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of him that hath the souerain authority ouer al, in whose gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the whole co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweale consisteth. The which gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, if it be in the hands of the people, is called popular, as in the Cantons of the Swissers, in the Grisian leagues, &amp; in many of the free cities of Almaine, &amp; was in old time at Athens: If it be in the hands of certain persons, as at this day it is amongst the gentlemen in Venice, &amp; in certaine families in Genes, then is it called a signorie: if it depend wholly vpon one mans authority, it is called a monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, as in France, Spaine, Portugal, &amp;c. Now the cause that moueth men to assemble to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> in cities, is not only to help one another in their mutual needs, but also to the end to liue togither, because that by nature they be companiable &amp; ciuill. And nature hath put a great pleasantnes in life, which makes it to be greatly desired, vnles folk be brought into extream misery of sicknes, pouerty, or furiousnes, which driue them into dispair, &amp; cause the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to wish for death by means of their aduersities &amp; discontentments. The diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of gouernments of cities depends vpon their ends: for if they tend to a good end, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are they good gouernments, if to an euil end; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are they euill gouernments: as for exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The which commeth to passe, not without good reason, for a fewe men may excell in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, but it is a hard matter for many to be exactly perfect in euery vertue, except it bee in the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like valiantnesse which is exercised by the multitude. Therefore the principall part of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweale <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> consisteth in men of warre, &amp; those that possesse the munition &amp; Armes, are members thereof Now these be the transgressions aboue specified, that is to say, Tyranny is the transgression of the kingdome: The Oligarchie is the transgression of the Aristocratie: and the Democratie or popular state, is the transgression of the Commonweale: for tyranny is a monarchie or sole reigne, hauing respect only to the profit of the monarch or party that raigneth: The Oligarchy regardeth the profite of the rich only: and the Democratie or popular state <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>endeth to the commodity of the poor only: nay there is not any of all these that prouideth for the benefit of the Commonweale. It is behoofefull to declare a little more at large what euery Commonweale is, because there remaine some doubts touching the same. For he that reasoneth as a Philosopher in euery methode, &amp; hath <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> not an eye to action only, but also to contemplation, ought not to neglect or admit any thing, but is to declare the truth in euery point. Nowe then tyranny is a Monarchie, or gouerning by one alone (as hath been aboue declared) that vsurpeth masterlike and lordlike authority and gouernement ouer th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ciuil society. The Oligarchie, is when rich men haue the soueraigne gouernment in their hands. Contrariwise, the Democratie or popular state, is when the poore haue the gouernement in their power, and not those which haue great riches. The first doubt is in the former definition or distinction: for if many rich men gouerne the City, and the Democratie or popular state is whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the multitude is cheefe gouernor: In like sort, if it happened that there were fewer poor then rich, &amp; yet those poor the stronger party &amp; masters of the gouernement: sith that is called an Oligar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> where the lesser number hath the dominion, those Commonweales should not seeme to bee rightly defined and distinguished. But if paucity be added to riches, and multitude to pouerty, and that the Oligarchie wherin the rich being few in number do gouern, and the Democratie wherin the poor being a great multitude rule &amp; command, should be called Commonweales, there would yet remain another hard point: for what should those Commonweales afore mentioned be, to wit, that where many rich men haue the gouernement, &amp; that where fewer poore men haue the soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine authority, if there be none other Commonweale besides those whereof we haue made menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? It seemeth by this reason, that the paucity or multiplicity of gouernours is an accident, the one of the Oligarchie, &amp; the other of the Democratie; Forasmuch as in all places there are few rich,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> and many poor. Therfore these causes make no difference, but the Democratie and Oligarchie do differ in pouerty &amp; riches: and there must needs be an Oligarchie wheresoeuer the gouernment is limitted by riches, whether there be few or many in number: &amp; wheresoeuer the poor haue the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> There are three good and indifferent Commonweales, and three bad ones. The good be those where the gouernors and superiors haue respect to the common profit of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one. The bad are those where the gouernors and superiours regard their owne perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer profit: for the gouernment alwaies consisteth in the superiors of the state, as hath ben alledged, and of them taketh the appellation. The gouernment of one, is called a monarchie: and if it be applied to the profite of the Commonweale, it is termed a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: if it tend to the perticular profite of one alone that gouerneth, it is called a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny. The gouernment of a certain number of Lords or Gentlemen prouiding for the welfare of the state is called an Aristocratie: And if any of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> seeke their own ambition <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and couetousnesse, and by conspiracie dispose of all affaires of the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monweale accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their owne pleasure, it is called an Oligarchie. The gouernement of many where the communalty is directed by the laws, is tearmed &amp; that rightly, a Commonweale, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Aristotles opinion: and on the contrary side, a Democraty or popular state is that where there is nothing but liberty and disorder in the people. Such as Plato in his 3 booke of lawes, and Zenophon haue described to haue ben the Democratie of Athens, when the people exceeded and ouerflowed in all liberty without feare of Magistrates or obseruance of lawes, whereof Demosthenes complaineth in certain of his Orations. Now euery one of these Commonweales haue certaine vnder-kinds and sub-diuisions, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> as shall hereafter appeare by the laying forth of this matter. The Oligarchies are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly where the rich gouerne, and are only admitted to Magistrateships and Offices, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the quantity of their wealth, and stint of their yearely reuenues. The Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craties are where poore and free men rule without any respect had of riches, nobility, or vertue, to the attaining of publicke Offices, but rather of liberty onely, and it makes no matter what number there be of either of them: Albeit, the Oligarchie is so tearmed, for that there are commonly in it a few rich men, and many poor men. Also Aristotle trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of the number of Commonweales, of their formes, ends, and customes: In the first booke of his Rhetoricke, the eight chapter, and in the eight of his bookes of Ethicks and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> tenth chap. he entreateth of three forms of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monweales &amp; of their transgressions, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither with that likenes &amp; similitude of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>weales, which is found in priuat families.</p>

                  <hi>LEt vs first see what end and bounds they appoint and limit to the Oligarchie, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and to the Democratie, and what is iust and rightfull in them both, for all speake of a kind of right and equity, but they reach not to that which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: as for example, That which is equall, seemeth rightfull and iust, and is so indeed, howbeit not to all persons, but to those onely that bee equall: and that which is vnequall, seemeth to bee rightf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore sith that which is iust, is iust to some persons, &amp; all one diuision and distinction is to be vsed, as well in matters, as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> in persons, as we haue before declared in our Ethikes: they agree in the equality of things, and not in the equality of persons, most specially for that cause which we rehearsed euen now, namely, that they are not indifferent iudges in matters concerning the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues. Further, wheras both parties ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> in some sort a kind of right, they suppose that they speake of right absolutely &amp; simply, for if the one party be vnequal in any kind of thing, as in richesse, then thinke they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither vnequal: &amp; if the other party be equal in any other thing, as in liberty, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> think they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues altogether equall: but neither party reacheth that which is the very perfect and principall
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:7218:92"/>
right indeed: for if they haue begun their society, &amp; assembled the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues togither into one place for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> possessions &amp; wealth sake, euery of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should haue as great part &amp; interest in the city &amp; Comon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale, as he should possesse of wealth. Therfore the reason of those that fauour the Oligarchie or go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ew, may seeme to be effectual, wherby they vphold that it is no indifferent &amp; right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful equality, that any party which to the furnishing &amp; making vp of a stock of a</hi> 100 <hi>pounds, had disbursed &amp; laid down but one pound, should reap as great a share &amp; portion as he that disbursed &amp; finished all the rest, as wel in the principal stock, as in al supplies, profits, &amp; increase therof. But the cause of mens assembling &amp; drawing togither into corporations &amp; cities, is not only to liue, but rather to liue wel: for if the cause of their assembly and ioining in society, were to liue only, the city should consist of slaues, &amp; of other creatures: but now it is not so, because they are neither partakers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> of felicity, nor liue according to their own choise &amp; wil: neither do they assemble in cities for war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like confederacies sake, to the intent, to defend the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that are comprehended in the league from out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage &amp; iniury at other mens hands, nor for traffick or increase of merchandise, for so should the Tuscans &amp; the Carthaginians, and al others that vse mutual entercourse &amp; traffick one with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, be as Citizens of one city, for they make couenants between the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues for safe intercourse &amp; trafficking togither, &amp; set down contracts and articles of agreement in writing, touching the not iniur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But if those that intend to stablish good lawes, haue a principall care of the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and of the vice of the citizens, it is without all doubt, that the city which is a true &amp; right ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in very deed, and not in name only, ought before all other things to haue a special care of vertue &amp; vprightnes: for lay this care aside, and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the society of citizens waxeth a confederacy of war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, differing in place only from others with whom they be in league, though they remain one far from another. Now the law is a couenant &amp; warrant amongst the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (as Lycophon the Sophister said) to hold &amp; keep them togither within the compasse of mutuall duty &amp; vprightnes one toward ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> but cannot make the citizens good &amp; iust: that so it is, it is a clear case, for if places far distant and remote, were assembled in one, in such sort, that the cities of the Megarians &amp; of the Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans should touch one another, yet for al that would they not be one city, nor if they should contract mariages one with another, though this be one of the most fit &amp; proper alliances &amp; communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings that are amongst citizens. Likewise if any did dwell asunder, &amp; yet not so farre asunder, but that they might communicat togither, &amp; enioy laws for the not iniurying one of another in their trades, as for exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, if one were a carpenter, another a husbandman, another a shomaker, &amp; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther some other artificers, &amp; were in this sort to the number of</hi> 2000, <hi>and yet had community of nothing but only of traffick and of warlike confederacy, for al that it should not be a city, and why <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> not? Not for that there wanteth vicinity and neighbourhood of society: for though those that so communicate, did assemble themselues togither, and should euery one vse his owne house after the fashion of a city, and helpe one another as confederates only against those that offer them any iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, yet should it seem no city to them that precisely consider the matter, vnlesse they should vse ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther maner of communicating in their assemblies then they do when they remaine thus asunder. Wherfore a city is not a community of place, neither was it ordeined to the end that they should be safeguarded from iniury, nor yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>or traffickes sake, but those things must be prouided for before it be a city, and though they be already prouided, yet shal it not be a city: but a city is a society ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to liue wel in houses and families; and to this end, to lead a perfect and sufficient life: which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> cannot be vnlesse they inhabite one place, and haue the vse of mariages: wherfore there haue ben brought in into Cities, both affinities, cobrotherhoods, sacrifices, and other manners and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes of liuing togither, which is the work of friendship, for friendship is nothing but an election of liuing orderly together, therfore the purpose and end of cities is to liue wel, and a city is a society of families and boroughes in a perfect and sufficient life, which is, as we haue already affirmed, to liue in al felicity and wealth. Now then a city is ordained for honest actions, and not for liuing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither onely. Wherefore they that further most in that society, haue a greater interest in the Citie

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> then those that are equall in liberty or in race, or those that are the mightiest, but vnequal in the ciuil vertue, or they that exceed in richesse, and are excelled in vertue by others.

               </p>
               <p>It is alledged that there is a certaine right in the Oligarchie and Democratie, being corrupted Commonweales, and in some respects contrary one to another. Vpon which right, they first ground themselues, that fauour and maintaine the Oligarchies, who for that they are the superiors, and cheefe both in riches &amp; nobility, do account themselues <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> for the superiours absolutely in all respects, and challenge as proper to themselues the greatest part of the gouernement, as reasonable in their opinions, that vnequall prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment should bee giuen to vnequall persons, and the people as equall in liberty with the rich &amp; noblemen do vphold that the gouernment of the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monweale should be equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly communicated to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, affirming that equal rewards belong to equal folke, but neither of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are to be allo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed: for the superiors in riches or nobility, are not absolutely supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors, nor the equal in liberty are not perfectly equal, but those only are to be accounted superiors, who are superiours in vertue, and those which are perfectly equall in vertue, ought to be accounted equal. And forasmuch as men do not assemble together in cities <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to the intent to liue only, but also to liue wel &amp; orderly, whervnto they are great furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers that be good &amp; vertuous men: therfore to them ought the greatest part of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment to be imparted. Amongst these matters is inserted a braue discourse, shewing what a city properly is. Wherin is declared, that for the constitution of a city, it suffiseth not that many men gather together in one place, or be allied by mariages, do aid one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother against those which offer them iniury, and that they possesse goods and trafficke togither, vnlesse all these things be ordained, to the end, to liue well &amp; happily, which is nothing els but the exercise of morrall and intellectuall vertues, to the which end, those cities can neuer attain, which haue for their ends &amp; scopes the right of the Oligarchies <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and Democraties, and not the true and absolute right, consisting cheefly in iustice distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butiue, which yeeldeth to euery man according to his deserts, and hath respect as wel to persons as to things, as hath ben declared at large in the fift booke of Ethicks.</p>
               <p>FVRTHER, <hi>wheras both parties acknowledge in some sort a kinde of right, they suppose that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> they speake of right absolutely &amp; simply.</hi>] Right &amp; equity is not well vnderstood in Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craties and Oligarchies: for in Democraties the populacy being all free alike, think that they may equally haue part in the gouernment, without any regard at al either of riches or nobility, only in regard of freedome: &amp; contrariwise in Oligarchies, they regard no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but riches and nobility, the lords and great men supposing, that all the commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> offices, &amp; dignities appertain to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alone, without any respect had to the common people, what sufficiency soeuer there be in any of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The which di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ference and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety between the populacy &amp; nobility, happeneth not only in these two kinds of policy, but also in euery other form, &amp; that for want of vnderstanding of the true politick right and equity, whence haue sprung vp in time past, &amp; doe spring vp from day to day at this present, &amp; wil also hereafter, many seditions and ciuill wars, threatning strange alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons &amp; changes, &amp; often the very destructions of Commonweales. The peasant or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimen of Swessia going about to establish their Democratie, partly droue out, &amp; partly slue the nobility of that country. It is not long since in Germany they made head &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> against the nobility there, vnder the pretext &amp; colour of the liberty of the gospel, but indeed to be freed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> greeuous taxes &amp; impositions which were laid vpon them. At Florence since the first fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dation of the city, vntil it was reduced into a dukedome, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tions neuer ceased between the people &amp; the nobility for the preheminence of the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sel, &amp; the distribution of offices. No lesse was the discord at Genes, betwixt the people &amp; the nobility, which was deuided into four principal families: of which four, two namely, the Spinulians &amp; Aurians were Gibelines, &amp; the other two, to wit, the Flisquians
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:7218:93"/>
and Grimaldians were Guelphes. The Athenian people was so disordered and let loose <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> to all vnbridled libertie, that they were almost past all shame and obedience to their lawes or Magistrates and consequently depriued of all mutuall amitie and familiaritie, which men liuing vnder one state should haue. In Carthage, at that time when it was destroyed by Scipio in the third Punicke warre, the people had the greatest power and preheminence. In Lacedemonia when as the Nobles roughly handled their Plow-men called Ilotians, they constrained them to rebell often against them, and to conspire with their enemies, whereupon many euils arose, euen to the bringing of the Citty into the greatest daunger that euer it was in. The like inconuenience almost befell all Italie by the bondslaues, and Spartacus the fencer their captaine, who raised vp a most dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> and wretched warre, called the Seruile warre. The common and baser sort of people among the auncient Gaules, were reputed for slaues, not possessing any thiug of their owne, nor being called to any consultation or management of affaires, but many of them either being iniured by the mighty ones, or burdened with debts, or eaten vp with exactions, yeelded themselues to the nobles, and by this means bec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

French men better instructed, doe altogether reiect all manner of slauish seruitude, yea and bondslaues comming out of other Countries into France, are presently enfranchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and set free as soone as they inter into that kingdome, their patrones not hauing power to sell them any more. At Venice, the signiours which haue all the authority in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> their hands, deuide amongst them<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In England the populacy is stronger then the nobility, and easier to bee stirred vp, being armed by a publicke decree. The Turkes that inhabite Anatolia and Greece, and other regions, haue either rooted out, and banished all the nobility, or at least wise left them naked of their goods. The Musco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uites left the Lords and Barons no castles nor fortresses at all to bee vnder their obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance.

And thus they haue no occasion to be discontented in their estates, or to practise any thing against the Nobility, knowing that by good and lawfull meanes they may attayne vnto the same degree of honour. The estates of the Nobility and of the popularity being thus managed and directed, and each of them enioying their seuerall rights and liberties, it is hard either for one to oppresse the other, or for both together to conspire against their head and monarch. If the Nobility, with whom is the possession of Armes, goe about to outrage the people, the sword of iustice defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them, and chastiseth the other, which hath authority (so that the King giue leaue) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to lay hands vpon the rebellious by force, so that be he neuer so great, whether Prince or other, he is compelled to obay thereunto: and this iustice is so respected, that when any of what quality or condition soeuer they be, are condemned, they indure the stroke of execution, will they, nill they. In like manner if the populacy which is in number farre greater, go about to rebell, or be tumultuous, the Nobility is so strong together with iustice, and the common people so weake in deedes of armes, that they may very easily be repulsed, and brought in subiection, by meanes whereof they thinke of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but how to liue in good ciuill, pollicy and vnity together, and aboue all in loyall obedience to their King, whome they hold in exceeding loue and singular reuerence, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> the Nobles being alwayes ready to put on armour when it is requisite, and the people to contribute to taxes and necessary subsidies: so that in all matters the King is serued and obeyed with good will, and without contradiction, better and more readily then any Prince in the world.

There could not bee deuised by any meanes a better and more commodious way, for the rest of the king and tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the realme.

                  <hi>IT is doubted of some, who it is that ought to beare rule and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion in a City, whether the multitude, or the richest sort, or the best men, or him that is best among the best, or a Tyrant. And euery one of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> these seemeth to carry some doubt and scruple with it: for what if the poor being more in number, do deuide amongst them the goods and possessions of the rich, Is it not vniust?

Againe, if the greater number vsurpe the goods of the fewer, is it not certaine that they destroy and spoile the Commonweale? And yet ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is not pernicious and hurtfull to him that hath it, nor right euer the cause of ruine in the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: wherefore it appeareth, that this law cannot be iust. Moreouer, if this were so, then necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all the acts of a Tyrant should be iust and lawfull, for being in authority he of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Whether therefore is it lawfull that a fewe and those the richer sort doe bear rule, or no? If they commit the like acts, robbing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spoiling the multitude of their goods, can we thinke their dominion iust? Sure, if the one be iust, the other is also: but without all question, they are both vnlawfull and wicked. But what if good men gouerne, and haue the authority ouer all things? Why then all other remaine without ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and are noted with discredite, in that they are not adorned with ciuill offices: for wee call

This sauoureth more of an Oligarchie then the former, for here are more that are depriued of honors, then were before. But it may be some man will say, that it is not meet at all for a man that is subiect to affections and perturbations of the mind, to beare rule in a Commonweale, but that the law should haue the preheminence. But for answere, if it bee a law appertaining to an Oligarchie or a Democraty, what dooth it concerne these doubtes which are propounded? For the same inconueniences will still arise from hence, as did be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For it is possible, that a great multitude, whereof euery one seuerally is not good, yet being assembled together may be better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sie, for one marketh one part; and another, another part; and all, all parts. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Howbeit, I confesse that good men doe farre differ from the common sort, when one is compared with one; as we say, that faire doth differ from foule, and artificiall pictures from true substances: because those excellencies which were diuided before, are collected and combined into one. For if the members of euery man bee compared with the parts of the picture, the eie of the one will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear more beautiful then the eie of the other, and so of any other part. Neuerthelesse, whither this difference between many, &amp; few good men, be to be admitted concerning euery multitude of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, it is vncertaine: yea rather it seemeth impossible in some, for it would then as well agree vnto brute beasts. For do we not see that many men do nothing at al in a maner differ fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> brute beasts? And yet all this letteth not, but that in some multitude of people, that which I haue said may bee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> prooued true, wherfore a man might resolue by this that hath been spoken, both the former prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent doubt, &amp; also the subsequent which followes, that is, what things ought to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to the discretion &amp; gouernment of freemen &amp; the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon people, that is, such as neither haue any abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of riches, nor reputation of vertue: for it is not a safe course to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> great charges &amp; dignities, by reason that by their vniustice &amp; vnskilfulnes, they would do much iniury, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit many errors: on the other side to exclude the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> altogither fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bearing offices, is also dangerous: for where there are so many debarred from honors, &amp; such a multitude of poor, there the city must needs be stuffed full of enemies. It remaineth therefore that they be admitted to the participation of iudgements and consultations: for which cause Solon, and some other Lawgiuers, make them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to bee ouerseers of the election of Magistrates, and giue them power to call to account and to correct those that haue beene in the Magistracie, but for them alone to beare rule and office, and to gouerne, they no waies allow of: for all being assembled together, haue sufficient vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, &amp; being mingled with the better sort, are profitable &amp; commodious to the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monweale; as vnpure &amp; grosse food mingled with pure &amp; fine, is more profitable for the nourishment of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, being much togither, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a little alone: for euery one apart is vnperfect &amp; vnfit to iudge, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as all togither are most fit &amp; perfect. Neuertheles, in this form of gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, there arise 2. doubts: the first is, that it seemeth to appertaine to him that can cure a sicknesse, &amp; rid a man fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a present disease, to censure of another, whether he hath done the part of a Phisition or no: &amp; this not only in Phisick &amp; a Phisition, but also in all other arts and faculties. As therefore a Phisition ought to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> giue an account of his practise to other Phisitions, and be by them reprehended if need be, so ought other artificers to do also. Now a Phisition is both he which practiseth by anothers direction, &amp; he which directeth others, &amp; also a third, which by bare experience attaineth vnto the art: for these thre are almost to be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in al arts: so we ascribe the authority of iudging no lesse to those that haue gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that skil by experience, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to those that haue it by knowledge: &amp; so also co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning election for to chuse wel is the office of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that haue knowledge: as for exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, none can chuse a good Geometri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian but those that haue knowledge in Geometry, none a good Pilote but those that haue knowledge
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:7218:95"/>
in Nauigation: For albeit, that many ideots and vnskilfull persons doe intrude themselues, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> presume to giue iudgement of workes and Arts, yet they doe it not better then those that haue knowledge. So that by this reason it seemeth, that neither the election nor correction of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates ought to be committed vnto the common people. But per aduenture all these arguments are not rightly alledged, especially for that reason which was before declared, namely, except the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple be too seruile. For euery one a part, must needs be a worse iudge then they that haue skil, but all together, cannot chuse but be either better, or as good: and also because in some things the worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man doth neither iudge alone, nor better of his owne worke then others that know the work, and yet haue no skil in the Art; as it doth not belong only to an architect to know and iudge of a house, but he that vseth the house, which is the maister of it, doth both know and iudge of it better then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> the builder: also a Pilote is better able to iudge of the sterne of a ship then a Carpenter: and of a banquet those that eat it, better than the cooke that dressed it. And thus this first doubt, though difficult and intricate, may be resolued. The second doubt dependeth vpon the first, for it seemeth very absurd, that the authority and guidance of greater matters, should rather bee in the power of naughty and wicked persons, then of those that are good and vertuous. Nowe the election and correction of Magistrates, are matters of greatest moment, the which in some places (as hath been said) are committed to the people, the popular assembly hauing soueraigne authority ouer all such things: for to assemble together popularly, to deliberate and to iudge, is allowed to men of small reuenue, and of all ages: but the Treasurorships and Captainships, and all other principall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> charges, are giuen to them only that are of great reuenues and possessions. This doubt might bee resolued by the like reason, for per aduenture this institution is not to be found fault withall: for neither a Iudge, nor a Counsellour, nor hee that deliberateth in an assemblie, hath any rule or go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, but the iudgement it selfe: the Senate and the people, are those that gouerne and beare rule, these (to wit, the Counsellor, the Deliberatour, and the Iudge) being but particles a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the other: wherefore not without great reason the greatest matters are committed to the multitude, the people, the counsell, and the Senate, consisting of many, whose reuenue all together, is farre greater then the reuenue either of one, or a fewe which manage great offices and estates. And let this suffice to haue beene spoken, concerning these matters. But as concerning the first <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> doubt, this especially resulteth thereof, that nothing ought to gouerne so much, or haue such power in a City, as iust and wholesome lawes: and that where and when the lawes cannot exactly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine of a cause, but are dumbe, because it is not easie to comprehend all accidentall cases in so ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall tearmes; then that the gouernor or gouernors, be they one or more, haue power and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to determine and decide. Albeit it be not yet declared in what manner good and profitable laws are to be esteemed, and so still the former doubt remaineth vndiscussed: Notwitstanding, it must needs be, that the lawes be alwaies like vnto the Commonweale whereunto they are annexed, that is to say, either good or bad, iust or vniust: for it is euident, that they must be fitted and applied to the Commonweale. And if this be true, it appeareth that in good Commonweales, the lawes must <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cessarily be good and iust, and in corrupt and bad Commonweales, corrupt and vniust.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It hauing been declared, that the difference and varietie of gouernements dooth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crew from that part which is of greatest soueraignty and power in a Citty, and which commandeth the rest: also how all Citties are necessarily gouerned, either by one sole man, or by a few together, or by the multitude, whence arise sixe kinds of policies, three good and three bad: Here in this chapter hee discourseth after what manner estates are best ordered: for there are many difficulties, whether the gouernment bee in the hands of some few, or in the power of the communalty: for if it bee saied, that it ought to bee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> committed to good men, then the rest being debarred from Offices and honours, will stirre vp seditions through discontent: or if it be pretended, that the law which is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out affection should absolutely command, he answereth that this also is not to bee fully admitted, because the law is alwaies fitted and applied to the estate wherein it is, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made at the will and for the commodity of the most mightie; so that for this cause, there is no lesse discommodity in the law, then in a man: also whether it be better to be
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:7218:95"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> gouerned by many, of which there is not one good and prudent man, or by a few good men. Whereunto it may bee answered, that if these many bee all naughtie, vnwise, and seruile persons, then it is better to be gouerned by a few good ones: but if they bee in a mediocrity that is reasonable good, the administration seemeth to bee farre more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious in their hands, then in a few good mens. And therfore that it is conuenient to commit vnto good men offices of greatest weight and moment, which are executed ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by perticular persons or by a few: but those offices that are administred by many to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, ought to be committed to the multitude, as namely to elect and correct Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, and to take an account of their charges. Finally it behoueth, that as much as is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> possible, the lawes doe beare sway in Citties without giuing any other libertie to the rulers, sauing in particular cases, which cannot be comprehended nor expressed by the generall lawes.</p>

                  <hi>NOw forasmuch as in all Arts and Sciences, the end whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to they tend, is a certaine good: therefore the greatest and principallest good, is the end of the greatest and principallest Art, which is the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Policie: Now, this politicall good is right and equity, consisting in the common profite of all. Now, all men thinke, that this right is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> equality: and therein in some sort they agree with the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicall reasons alledged in our Ethicks: for they say that there ought to bee a certaine right, and that amongst some men, and that it ought to bee also equall amongst equals. Wherefore it is behoofefull to consider in what things equality and inequality consisteth, because this is not void of doubt, nor beside the purpose and intent of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill Philosophie: for it may bee some man will say, that Offices and Magistracies ought equally to be distributed, according to the excellencie of all goodnesse: albeit, the men differ not in other matters, but are alike: and that to them that differ from each other, there must be a diuers equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which ariseth vnto them of their diuerse dignity and worth. Notwithstanding, if this bee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> true, then must more politicall right bee attributed to them that excell most in regard of their beauty, or of their t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For among Musitions, in regard of that Art, to them that are cunning and expert alike, wee must not giue more or better instruments, because they are more noble, for that would not make them play any whit the better: but it is meete to giue the best instruments to those that are most excellent in the Art. If this bee not yet plaine inough, it shall be made more plain by that which followeth: for if any excell in the Art of Musick, and yet is farre inferiour in nobility and beauty, though both these bee farre greater goods then the other, and excell them in proportion, yet the best instruments must be giuen to the former: for it is meet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> to giue the preheminence to the worke, without hauing regard either to riches, nobility, or any thing els, which helpe nothing in that respect. Againe, by the same reason euery good might bee compared with euery good: for if that excell which excelleth in quantity certainely greatnesse of quantity shall deserue wholly to bee compared with riches and liberty: wherefore if this man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell more in bignesse, then that man in vertue, and if greatnesse be a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

I confesse indeed, that in the exercises of the body, some honour is due to such things: but in thinges belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to a Citie, it is doubtfull and in contro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore those that are noble, free, and rich, haue good reason to assume vnto themselues this honour: for it is necessary, that Citizens be free, and rich, able to support publicke charge, and pay tributes: for a City cannot possibly stand of all poore men and seruants. Nowe if a City stand in neede of such thinges as these, it must also necessarily stand in neede of iustice and warlike vertue, which are full as necessary, except that a Citie cannot bee, nor consist without the former, but it cannot well bee, nor consist without the latter: It should seeme therefore, that all these thinges, or some of them doe contend with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> in the establishing of a City: and that discipline and vertue contend in the leading of a happie life, as it hath beene declared before. But forasmuch as those that are equall in one thing onely, ought not to ascribe vnto themselues equality in all: nor those that are vnequall in one, inequality in all, therefore it is necessary, that all such formes of Commonweales bee faultie, and farre from the right. It hath alreadie beene declared, that all doe contend iustly after a sort, and yet not all simply iustly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Free men and Nobles, as neighbours, seeing that those which haue more Nobility, haue more right in a City then the ignoble. And euery one esteemeth Nobilitie in his countrey, as a thing very honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> seeing it is likely, that the best Parents should beget the best children: for Nobility is nothing els but the vertue of the stocke and race. In like manner, wee may say that vertue dooth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend rightfully: for wee call iustice a sociable and ciuile vertue, which draweth on with it all other vertues necessarily: yea and many contend also with fewe, and that not without cause: for they are euen more mighty, richer, and better, if many be compared with fewe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if all these were in one City, I meane good men, rich men, and Nobles, and withall another ciuill multitude, whether would there bee any contention betweene these or no, Which of them should administer the Commonweale? Therefore in euery one of these Commonweales before spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, that iudgement is vndoubtfull and without controuersie, who ought to commaund and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> beare rule therein. For the difference of States ariseth by the difference of those that beare rule and authoritie in the states, as one in that state which is gouerned by the rich, another in that which is gouerned by good men, and so of the rest in like manner. Neuerthelesse, let vs consider if these things should happen at one and the same time, howe they are to bee determined. If the vertuous bee a very small number, howe should we then proceed? Must wee haue regard to the worke, if by reason of their paucity they cannot gouerne the City? Or if their number bee great ynough, so that a City may consist of them, yet is there a question and doubt concerning all those that striue for ciuill honours: for they that seeke to gouerne for their wealth sake, or for the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of their stocke, doe seeme to alledge no lawfull cause: because if any one should bee the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chest <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> amongst all, by this reason, that one man should command and gouerne all: in like manner also, if any one should excell all others in Nobility, the same also should excell in authority those, which being free men, contend about the gouernment. The same inconuenience will happen in an Aristocratie, in regard of vertue: for if any one were better then the rest which haue any thing to doe with the publicke gouernement, the same one ought to bee superiour in authority to the rest by that reason. Also if the multitude ought therefore to gouerne, because many are stronger then few; then it followes if one, or some more number then one, but yet fewer then the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, were stronger the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Forasmuch as the end of ciuill policie is Iustice, respecting that which concerneth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> publicke commodity, and also that equity is nothing els but a certaine equality and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency: wee must consider such an equality and excellencie, not that consisteth in all thngs, but onely in those which appertaine to the worke, and to the politicke end, and so to distribute the offices and honours of the Commonweale. In which regard men are often deceiued in euery estate, in supposing that if they excell in riches and nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or some such like thing, therfore the cheefe dignities belong vnto them. Now if such a prerogatiue should take place, or be of force, it were as meet also to consider the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of the complexion, of beauty, or of strength, of them that should beare rule, as they vsed to doe in old time in Asia and India: which is a thing most impertinent &amp; ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Wherefore it is not conuenient in the communion of the Commonweale, and in the bestowing of offices and dignities, to haue regard to the equality or excellency of al things, but onely of those which concerne the common good. Forasmuch therefore, as the end of a good Commonweale is to liue well according to vertue, the equalitie and excellencie in vertue ought principally therein to bee obserued. For which cause in the state of Venice, the signiors which are true citizens, to the end to preuent all such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitorie quarrels and contentions, haue this institution amongst them, to distribute their publicke offices in such sort, that as farre as may possibly bee, all the families may be partakers of those common dignities: And yet with such aduisement and considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> that onely those that are renowmed for wisedome, bounty, and vertue, do gouerne and manage their affaires: mingling thus together the Democratie and Aristocraticall Oligarchie, when they vse partly casting of lots, which is Democraticall, as in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of electours: and partly election which is Aristocraticall in the distribution of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, committing the same to the estimate and censure of the Cittizens. For to chuse Magistrates by lot, is proper to a Democratie, and they which proceed so, doe measure and ballance equity by an Arithmeticall equality, which would haue all men to enioy the like priuiledge of right and profite, and the like ability to obtaine Magistracies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are all Cittizens and freemen, and therefore equall priuiledges are due to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> persons. But in an Oligarchie they proceede after another sort, for it would haue the greatest and highest dignities to bee conferred vpon those that are in greatest and highest esteeme in regard of riches and Nobilitie, because that vnequall priuiledges doe appertaine to vnequal persons. But these two opinions doe erre in this, that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer measureth equality onely by number, that is, in that they are all Cittizens; and the latter esteemeth equality only by riches and nobility: for seeing that the body politicke was first ordained to this end, that men might liue well and happily, onely vertue ought to make this difference: of which matter, more shall bee spoken hereafter in the first Chapter of the fift booke of this worke.</p>

                  <hi>IF any one, or more then one, and yet not so many as may bee able to make a full complement of a city, doe excell others so much, according to the excellency of vertue, that the vertue of all other, nor their ciuill power, be equally comparable with theirs, if they be many; if they be one, with one: yet these are not to be numbred to the parts of a City: for they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> should bee preiudiced which are so vnequall, according to vertue and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil power, if they shall not bee thought worthie to obtaine things equall. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Therfore it is likely such a man to be as a god amongst men: from whence it appeareth, both the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> constitution of lawes to be necessary amongst equals; both in kind and power: but according to such there is no law, for they themselues are a law vnto themselues: and he were ridiculous which should go about to decree lawes against the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. They would alledge perchance that which Antisthenes said the Lions to haue spoken when as Hares did conferre in an assembly, and euery one requested <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> that they might haue al things equal. Therfore the popular cities do constitute an Ostracisme for such a cause, for they seem to prosecute equality aboue al things: so that they did Ostracise, &amp; vntil <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> some definit times remoue them from the citie who did seeme to excel in power of riches, of mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold friendship, or any other political force.

This probleme generally doth concerne all Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monweales, &amp; those that are good: for these disordered Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monweales which are only respectiue of their priuat good, do this, &amp; not they alone, but those which entend the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon good, are like affected: this is manifest by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther arts and sciences. The painter will not permit any liuing creature pictured, to haue a greater <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> foot the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is proportionable, not although it doth excell in beauty; nor a shipwright the hinder part of the ship, or any other part to be larger then it should be: neither the master of a quire wil admit <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> him to sing in the quire which hath a louder or a better voice the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the whole quire. Wherefore, for this cause nothing doth hinder the Monarchs, that they should not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent vnto the cities in this, if they respect their priuat security, &amp; the profit of their subiects. Thus according to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fessed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies, the treatise co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning Ostracisme, hath something that is iust and politick: but it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter certainly, that the lawmaker should compasse his Commonweale at the beginning, that it may not need this medicine. The second meane is, if it so happen, to endeuor with some such discipline to correct it; which was not done in the cities: for they did not looke to the profit of a priuat Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>weale,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> but they vsed these Ostracismes mutinously. In troublesome &amp; disordered Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monweals, that it is priuatly commodious &amp; iust, it is manifest; perchance not that it is simply iust. But in the best gouerned co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monweals it hath some doubt, not according to the excellency of some good things, as power, riches, &amp; much friendship; But if any man excell in vertue: what is meet to bee done then?

               <p>If either one or a few persons doe so much excell in vertue in cities, that none other are to be compared with them, it is iust and requisite that they doe alwaies commaund ouer the rest; but the like is not to be vsed amongst them that excell in riches, nobility, or plurality of friends: for where regard is had to such goods in the distribution of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, there the state of Commonweale is corrupted and depraued. But yet in euery Commonweale, bee it good or bad, it is best that there bee not amongst the Citti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> too great inequalitie, and it is meete to preuent this by Lawes and constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

Plutarch in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the life of Licurgus. There is nothing here below more acceptable vnto God, nor more approching to his diuinitie, then to raigne well in iustice and equity. Wherefore euery good King and Monarch ought rather to seeke for praise and reputation from good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and vertue, then that which proceedeth from might and puissance: for as the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine essence, to the which kings so much desire to conforme and equalize themselues, doth excell all other essences and natures, in three things principally, to wit, in immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie, power, and bountie, certainely of the three, bounty and vertue is most venerable, and that wherein most of the diuinity appeareth: for, as for incorruptibility &amp; immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, the foure elements and the void place, are so as well as God, as the naturall Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> hold: and as for force and power, the earthquakes, the thunders, the violent tempests of winds, the streames and innundations of waters, haue that also; but as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching iustice, vprightnesse, and equity, there is nothing in the worlde that can pertake thereof, except it bee a diuine thing, by the meanes of reason and vnderstanding. And therefore albeit that men ordinarily carry three different affections towards the gods; one, in that they esteeme them happie, another wherwith they feare them, and the third whereby they honour them: it seemeth that they account them happie, because of the eternitie and immortality of their essence; that they fear them and stand in awe of them, because of their soueraigntie and almightinesse; and that they loue, honour, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> them because of their iustice: and yet notwithstanding, of these three qualities, those which men most desire, are immortalitie, whereof humane nature is not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: and power, the greatest part whereof dependeth vpon fortune: and in the meane while, they leaue vertue behind, which is the only good thing of the goods, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of wee may bee pertakers: wherein they deceiue and abuse themselues greatly, because vertue and iustice doth make their life, who are placed in high hegree of fortune, full of power and of diuine and heauenly authoritie, and iniustice maketh it brutish &amp; sauage<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But after that by practises and deuises they began to punish after this sort base fellowes, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times wicked persons, as Hiperbolus who was the last that was banished, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians desisted altogether from the vse thereof. It will not bee amisse to declare in this place how and for what cause this Hiperbolus was banished. Alcibiades and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> Nicias were the cheefest men of authoritie of their time in Athens, who hauing stung and wrenched one another, as it ordinarily happeneth betwixt equals, and perceiuing that the people in a certaine assemblie were about to proceed to this iudgement of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracisme, they doubted much that it was to this end to banish one of them two, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon they conferred togither, and agreed themselues &amp; their adherents and followers, and so coupled them all in one league, in such sort, that when they came to collect the

They therefore seeing that order of Ostracisme so em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>based and dishonoured, would neuer more vse it, but vtterly abolished the vse thereof. But to make it knowne summarily what this was, and how it was vsed: It is to bee obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that vpon a certaine set and prefixed day, euery Cittizen brought a shell, whereon he wrote the name of him whom hee would haue to be banished, and brought it into a certaine sure place enclosed with a wall of wood, which was there made for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: after, when euery one had brought thither his shell, the Magistrates and Officers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of the City came to recken all the shels togither: for if the number of Cittizens, that brought shels thus written, was lesse then six thousand, then the Ostracisme was imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. This being done, they diuided and put apart all the shels that had the same names writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in them, and he that was found written in the most shels, was by the sound of the trumpet proclaimed banished for ten years, during the which, he enioied neuerthelesse all his goods. Therfore as euery man thus wrote vpon his shel his name whom he would haue banished, it is reported that there was a certaine peasant so blockish and ignorant, that hee could neither write nor read, who came to Aristides, meeting him first, &amp; gaue to him his shel, desiring him that he would write thereon the name of Aristides, wherat <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Aristides wondering, asked him whither Aristides had done him any displeasure or no: no answered the peasant, and that which is more, I doe not know the man, but it displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth me to heare him so called euery where by the name of iust. Aristides hauing heard this answere, replied not a word, but wrote himselfe his owne name vpon the shell, and so gaue it him againe.</p>

Herodotus in his first booke intituled <hi>Terpsichore,</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth that Thrasibulus gaue this counsel to Periander, and not Periander to Thrasibulus, as Aristotle here reporteth in these two places. But howsoeuer it was, the story is stil of the same substance. After (saith Herodotus) that Periander trafficked by embassage with Thrasibulus a potentate of Militum, hee beeame more cruell and bloody then euer was his father Cypselus, he sent to the same Thrasibulus to knowe by what meanes after hee had confirmed his estate, hee might best gouerne his Cittie. Thrasibulus led his Emba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssadour <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> out of Miletum into a large corne field, and there began to walke, questioning with the Embassadour about his iourney, and of the accidents which had befallen him since his comming from Corinth, in the meane while striking downe the eares of corn which were higher then the rest, and casting them to the ground, thus spoiling a whole field of goodly thicke corne. When he had thus walked sufficiently, without giuing any other answere to the Embassadour, he sent him away: who returning to Corinth, Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander was very desirous to heare some newes of his Embassage, but hee tolde him, that Thrasibulus had nothing at all aduised him touching his demand, &amp; that he maruelled why he had sent him to such a foolish and sencelesse fellow, which spoiled his own good; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> &amp; thervpon recounted all that which Thrasibulus had done: but Periander vnderstood right well that Thrasibulus meaning was, that he should put to death all the cheefest me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Corinth, &amp; therupon practised all the cruelty in the world towards his subiects, fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing the murders of his fathers Cypselus, by putting to death all that were left by him.</p>

Polit. <hi>lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. sayth: That the changes of Commonweales doe happen by an vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> growth: For euen as the body is composed of parts &amp; members, and ought to growe by proportion, to the end, that there may bee a commensuration in all parts, otherwise it perisheth, when the foot is foure cubites long, and the rest of the body but two handbreadths, yea and oftentimes it might bee transformed into the shape of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beast, if it should not onely in quantity, but also in quality encrease aboue iust pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion: so a Citty is constituted of many parts, amongst the which, oftentimes some one groweth more largely then the rest. In the same booke, <hi>cap.</hi> 8. This is a common rule in a Democratie, Oligarchie, Monarchie, and euery kind of policy, not to make any too great aboue measure; but rather to distribute small Offices, and of long continuance,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> then great, and short: for men are quickly depraued, and it is not in euery one to support the prosperity of fortune: or at least when much power is giuen to any, not to take it from them againe all at once, but by little and little: and especially to prouide by lawes, that no man doe aduance himselfe too much in friends and riches; but that if there bee any such, they be commanded to absent themselues out of the City: and if any member of the Citty becommeth through prosperity too insolent and haughtie, there ought re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to be had thereunto by the same meanes. In the same booke <hi>cap.</hi> 9. As a nose passing the iust proportion, is notwithstanding faire and well fauoured, but if it bee stretched out excessiuely, then first the member is depriued of mediocritie, and at last it commeth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> to that passe, that it hath not any more the shape of a nose, by reason of the excesse or defect of contraries: and the same is to be thought of the rest of the members. The like happeneth in Commonweales, for an Oligarchie or a Democratie might be tollerable, albeit they were somewhat declining from their right institution: but if either the one or the other be extended too farre, then first the Commonweale is but hurt and made worse, but at last it becommeth no Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monweale at all. In the same booke, <hi>cap.</hi> 11. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, there is a generall Caueat for the safety and preseruation of euery Monarchie, not to suffer any one to growe too mightie, or if it must be so, then to make more then one, because they will obserue and haue an eie to each other: or if by chance it be necessarie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> to aduance some one, not to take such a one as is of stout and proud conditions, for such are in all actions great vndertakers and enterprisers. And againe, if it seemeth meete to abase and put downe the credite and authority of any great man, it behooueth that it be done by little and little, and not at one clap. This aduertisement hath ben ill vnderstood, and worse practised by many Kings, Emperors, and Monarchs, who hauing exalted too high some of their friends and seruitours, haue beene afterwards either themselues or their children ruinated and destroyed by them: or sometimes when they haue smelt out their faults, haue ben constrained to put them to death, as Tiberius serued Seianus, into whose hands he had before committed the whole gouernment of the Romane Empire.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> Sultan Solyman put to death in like manner Hibrahim Bassa, whom he had almost made equall to himselfe a little before in authority, in such sort, that they called him king of the Gardiners, and the Bassa the king of the souldiours: And notwithstanding, vpon a certaine night hauing inuited him to supper, and forced him to lie in the pallace, hee caused him to be slaine, and his body to be cast into the sea, and the next morrow all his goods to be seized and transported as things confiscate, no man euer knowing the true cause of his death, saue that he was growne too great, and consequently suspected of his Lord, and hated of others. Paulus Iouius discourseth hereof at large at the end of the 32. booke of his Hystories: Who also in the 14. booke sayeth, That the Turkish Empire is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> principally gouerned by the counsell &amp; prowesse of slaues, who can easily without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to the prince be aduanced to great honours and offices, and without tumult and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy of the people, bee abased, thrust downe, and murthered. The Crowne of France was translated from the race of Clouis vnto the stocke of Charles Martel, by giuing too much authority to the Maires of the pallace, and the Constables of France: and by the same meanes was again transplanted from this linage to another.

                  </gap>thfull and so much addicted to their pleasure, that no account was made of them. And thus the gallant house of Clouis degenerated, and came to nothing. And as much as their predecessors made it their cheefest glory to encrease their kingdomes and signories: So much these their successours placed all their felicity and happinesse in idlenesse and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous pleasure: They shewed themselues onely abroad in publicke, the first day of May, when they receiued those presents which were giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, not entermedling with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> any other affaires of the Commonweale. On the other side, the Constables receiued the Embassages of forraine Kings and Emperours, and gaue them their answeres, making at their discretions, leagues and truces, warre and peace, ordinances &amp; laws for the whole kingdome: and by howe much the more the kings did reiect and cast off all such care, as being a thing too painefull, by so much the more did the Constables augment and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease their power and authoritie. See howe the mind of man is neuer content with the fauours of fortune, and neuer satiate. The Constables which came vp of so lowe a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, being at the first called but Maires of the pallace, grewe so in short time, that they quickly attained to that high and great authority, that they made no reckoning not of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the kings themselues, being so idle and slouthful: who if they had gone about to refrain and bridle this boldnesse, seeing that they could doe nothing of themselues, could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haue vndone that which they had done and suffered so long, because it was thought that these Constables had had this great power from all conti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>uance of time, and that the absolute command and rule of the kingdome was due vnto them. Therefore those that are elected to any kingdome, ought diligently to haue care to ouerturne and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent the too great boldnesse of their subiects, at the very birth and beginning of it: for after that it is once engrafted and hath taken roote, it is impossible to pull it out againe, without the full destruction of the parties, and often also with their dammage and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> that seeke to quench the same. This therefore may serue in steed of an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for Kings, Emperors, and other Princes, for the history should be written to no end and purpose, if they should not learne thereby to raigne well, and vertuously to gouern the Commonweale. In regard of this, almost all Commonweales both auncient and moderne, haue ben by succession of times filthily beguiled, except the Venetian onely: which besides that the Nobles and Lords who haue the rule and managing thereof, are not ambitious, hath by certaine constitutions moderated the authority of Magistrates, depriuing them in the greatest affaires, of soueraigne power; and creating them almost all of short continuance, together with this prouiso, that three of one linage may neuer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> bee lawfull Senatours, or other Magistrates at one time, to the end, that one part of the Communaltie should not become stronger then the other, but that all should be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the publicke power and authority. Moreouer, tenne men were appointed whose charge and office was principally to foresee and prouide that no sedition or ciuill quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell might rise amongst the Citizens, whence any faction might grow, and that no trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or surprise might be attempted against the Citty by any wicked Citizen desirous of raigne, or ouerladen with debts or crimes: and that if perchauncc any such mischeefe should secretly happen, they had soueraine power in their hands to punish and correct them, and to procure that the weale publick sustaine no detriment. Also to the end, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> no Citizen might make himselfe too mighty in deeds of armes, and attendance of men, &amp; so get means to attempt ought against the signory; they vse in their land wars strange souldiours, euen to the Generall of the armie, who ordinarily is some Prince or Lord of Italy wel experimented and reported of in feats of warre, to whom they giue good and honorable entertainment, who neuerthelesse dareth not decern or determine any thing without the counsel of them which are conioined with him in commission by the signo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.

               <p>
                  <hi>THese thus manifested, it is expedient peraduenture to discourse otherwise, and to consider of a kingdome: for this forme of gouernment wee say is to bee reckoned in the number of those that bee good. But wee are to consider whether it bee expedient for a Citie and Country where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in men are to liue well and happily, that men obey the rule of a king, or follow some other course or gouernement: or whether it bee conuenient to some to bee subiect to the regall Empire, and to some others, not so conducible. But first wee are to diuide and distinguish of gouernements, and to see whether the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> gouernement of one or of many bee best. And this is easie to bee knowne, that there be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny kindes of gouernements, and that the order of gouernement is not alike in all men. For the forme of the Commonweale amongst the Lacedemonians seemeth to bee the most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Commonweale of all approoued Commonweales, and yet one King enioyeth not soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigntie: but when hee is out of the Lacedemonian bounds, hee is but captaine and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall of warlike affaires. Further, all diuine matters concerning the seruice of the gods are committed vnto them. This kingdome therefore is like to a walike Empire, which captaines in warre <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>btaine in their cheefe and perpetuall gouernement: For hee hath not authoritie to put to death, but in a certaine kingdome onely, and in warlike affaires, as it is amongst <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> the auncient, by a certaine Lawe which consisteth in blowes and armes. The which Homer declareth: For Agamemnon heard patiently reuiling speeches and taunts in publicke as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies, but out of an assemblie had free and entire power of putting to death, for so hee sayeth: Whome I shall see to depart from the battaile to the Nauie, let not him thinke that hee hath so escaped the foules and the dogges: and in another place, I haue sentence and cheefe power of death in my handes. This therefore is one kingdome, the Empire of warre in the whole course of life. And of these kinde of kingdomes, some are Heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and appertaining to a linage, othersome by election, and the choice and suffrages of the people. There is another kinde of Monarchie besides this, as are kingdomes amongst <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> certaine Barbarians. All these haue force and power like vnto a Tyrannicall Empire, notwithstanding, they are agreeable to the lawe, and Hereditarie: For, because that the Barbarians are of more seruile manners then the Grecians, and Asians, and Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians, they beare a Maisterlike sway, neither doe they this anie way against their wils: These kingdomes are therefore tyrannous for this cause, notwithstanding sure and stedfast, both because they are so ordered by the countries, as also because they are so by discent of auncestrie, and also legitimate. And the custodie is regall, not tyrannicall, for the same cause; for Kings are beset and guarded with the weapons of Citizens, but tyrants with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine power: for these rule by Lawe, and men obey them willingly: but those against <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> lawe raigne ouer men in despight of them. So these haue the custodie of Citizens offered them, these other haue it gotten by strength. These are two kinde of Monarchies there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. There is another furthermore, that flourished amongst the auncient Grecians, which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> they call AEsynnetas: And this kinde of Monarchie is altogether affected of Tyrants, whether it bee by voice or consent of the people offered, which differeth from a barbarous tyrannie, not in that it is not agreeable to the lawe, but in that they descend not by auncestrie
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:7218:100"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> nor kindred. And this kinde of Empire, some obtained all their life, some others vntill someset times, and to doe some certaine thinges: for example sake, the Mitylenaei deliuered and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered in times past one Pyttacus against certaine exiles, whose leaders were Antimeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des and Alceus the Poet. And Alceus the Poet declareth in a certaine rayling verse, that Pyttacus the Tyrant was taken of the Mitylanians: for hee findeth fault with them, that they created Pyttacus (a man borne in a base and miserable country) Tyrant ouer a meane and an vnfortunate Citie: and being gathered together, extolled him to heauen with prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. These Monarchies therefore both are and were (because they were tyrannous) mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterlike and proper to lords: but in that they were electiue and offered by consent of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and also in that they are vsed ouer voluntaries, they are regall. Nowe the fourth kinde of regall Monarchie comprehendeth the same which flourished in those heroicall times, in the which the people obeyed of their owne accord; and those which were by succession and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate. For because that the first men deserued well of the multitude, either by inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the Arts; or making warres, or because they gathered together the dispersed, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they affoorded them ground and lande, they were not onely created Kinges of the voluntaries themselues, but also they yeelded vp their kingdome obtained, to their children and posteritie: And they had in their power the disposition of the warlike Empire, and those sacrifices, which belonged not to the Priests, and besides they decided controuersies. And <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> this did diuers of them, being sworne, and diuers others vnsworne: And this oath was made by the taking vp of the scepter. Kings therefore which were in auncient times, did alwaies moderate and gouerne ciuill and rurall affaires, and those thinges which stret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched themselues beyond the bounds of the Empire. And lastly, Kings dismissing partlie of their owne accord these thinges, and the people partlie detracting in other Cities, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices were left onely for kinges: but in those parts which worthily merited the name of a kingdome, they onely helde the principality of martiall discipline out of the limits of the kingdome.</hi>

signory, or popularity, that is in mind of man, where the issue male failing, females haue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> succeeded: as in Spaigne, England, and Scotland. Further, in Hereditary kingdomes where the males onely succeede, in some places that honour is onely kept for the first borne, honest portions being alotted to the younger brethren, as in France: or els with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regard had to the birthright, hee is preferred of the sonnes, which is found most fit and able to gouerne, or he that is most warlike disposed, and most fauoured of the soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours, as in Turkie, Selimus the first, being the third and last sonne of Baiazeth the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, vsurped by the helpe of the Ianissaries, the Empire from his father himself, whom hee caused to bee poysoned, and his two elder brethren, Achmat and Corcuth to bee slaine, with all their nephewes and linage of Ottoman: saying that nothing was more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> sweet then to raigne without the feare of kindred. In other places they doe not put to death their brethen and kindred, but pinne them vp close in some sure guard, as they do in AEthiopia, where hee onely remaineth, that must reigne, the rest are all sent into a high and strong Mountaine, called the Mountain of the Israelites: whence it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for any male euer to issue, except it fal out, that Prester Iohn die without heire of his bodie to succeede in the Crowne: for then one is taken out who is neerest in blood, or thought most worthy in reputation.

                  <hi>THese are the kinds of gouernements, foure in number, the first which flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished in the heroicke times, ouer such as voluntarily subiected themselues in certaine definite matters, for the king himselfe was both generall of the warre, iudge, and high Priest: the second, barbarous successiue by linage, wherein the subiects were gouerned according to the lawes of seruaunts: the third, which they call AEsymnetia, that is, tiranny by election of voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: the fourth Laconicall, that is to say in one word, a perpetuall milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry intendencie by tribe: these kingdomes differ thus among themselues. The fift kind of admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> when one is sole lord of all: as euery Nation and euery Citie hath power ouer common things, and followeth the example of the Oeconomie, for as the Oeconomie is a kinde of houshold gouernment, so is the gouernement of a Citie, and the Oeconomie of one or more Nations. Nowe there are almost two kindes of gouernement, whereof wee are to speake, this, and the Laconicall. The others, or the greater part of them, are a mean betwixt these two. For either the Kings haue
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:7218:102"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> lesse authoritie then in an absolute Commonweale, or more then in the Laconicall: wherefore the whole matter consisteth in two points: the one is, whether it bee profitable to the Citie to haue in it a continual Gouernour and Generall of the warres, and that hee bee created by succession in stocke and linage, or whether hee bee elected by suffrages according to the vertue and dignitie of the person, or whether this bee not so profitable: the other is, whether it bee profitable to haue the Kingdome gouerned by one solely, although the consideration of such a Captaine pertaineth rather to the Lawes, then to the Common-weale, as a thing that cannot hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in euery Commonweale. Leauing therefore the first manner of gouernement, let vs come to the other, which is the forme of a Commonweale, and let vs breefely resolue the doubts <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> therein.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The beginning of this question is; Whether it bee more expedient for a Commonweale <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> to bee administred by a good man, or by a good Lawes? They which thinke it more expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for Cities to bee gouerned by a King; doe suppose, that the Lawes doe speake onely in generall tearmes, and not to prouide for particular cases, and therefore that it would be absurd and foolish to commaund in anie Art, according to the prescript rules and Lawes of the same. And in AEgypt the Phisitions are not permitted to meddle with any disease before the fourth day being past: and if they doe minister before that time, it is at their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill and hazard. Wherefore it is apparent, that that is not the best forme of regiment, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> which followeth the letters of the Lawe. And yet it is necessarie, that this vniuersall reason bee in all Gouernours: For that must needes bee better which is voide of passion and perturbation of the minde, then that which naturally is affected therewith. Nowe, the Lawe is without all passion, but the minde of man is necessarily subiect vnto pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But peraduenture some may obiect, that a good man will recompence the hauing of affections, by being able to iudge in particular cases, which the Lawe cannot doe, and therefore that it is necessarie that hee bee the Lawe-disposer: and also that there bee Lawes written, yet not fullie confirmed and vnuiolable, in regard that they maie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> differ and varie from the truth, namely in those thinges which are not within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe of the Lawes, (albeit in other thinges they must bee ratified) as in this question, Whether one good man solely, or manie togither ought to gouerne? For nowe adaies ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie assembled togither, doe discusse, consult, and iudge of matters; and all these iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are of particular cases: Therefore one, whatsoeuer hee bee, compared to manie, is farre inferiour (for a Cittie consisteth of manie) euen as a banquet prepared and furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed by manie, is more exquisite then a simple Table: And therefore a multitude iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth better then anie one is able to doe. Further, a multitude is lesse subiect to corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then one, like as water, the more plentifull it is, the lesse it putrifieth. But when <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> as one Iudge is ouercome with choller, or anie other passion, then must the iudgement needes bee depraued: Whereas in a multitude, all of them cannot bee chollericke or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued. But let vs suppose a multitude, which doe nothing contrarie to the Lawe, but that which they needes must: or if that bee hard to bee found amongst manie, yet at least, if they were manie good men and good Cittizens, the question is, whether these manie good, bee more or lesse subiect to corruption then one? if it bee replied that they will bee seditio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s, which one cannot bee: I answere, that being good and vertuous in minde, they are indeede but as one, though manie. If therefore wee determine the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of manie good men to bee an Aristocratie; and of one, a Regalitie or Monarchie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> sure an Aristocratie will bee more welcome to Citties; then a Monarchie, whether the estate bee ioyned with authoritie, or without: For as much as there are to bee found manie of like qualitie. And therefore in times past they suffered themselues to bee gouerned by Kinges, because manie excellent and worthie persons were not then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, especiallie when as they inhabited small Citties. Furthermore, Kinges were cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated onely for their bountifulnesse, which bountifulnesse is the proper office of good

men: but when as plentie of these vertuous and good men began to abound, then they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> could not anie longer endure the dominion of one, but sought for a c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Afterwards when these began againe to decline and wax worse, enriching themselues by the common good, it is likely, that from thence arose Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garchies, where riches are helde in so high honour and account. Againe, from these they grewe first to Tyrannies, and then from tyrannies to Democrati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And then Cities growing great, it was not easie to chaunge by bringing in anie other. Moreouer, if it were more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> for Cities to bee gouerned by Kings, what should become of their children? must they also raigne in their fathers steades? But what if they degenerate from their fathers vertues, would not their regiment bee dangerous? But some will say, that the father hauing all in his owne power, will not bequeath the kingdome to his children? I but this is not credible, and besides it is a vertue that humane Nature is not capable of: Besides, there is a diffic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lt question concerning the power of the King, whether hee ought to bee guarded with anie power continually about him, whereby to constraine to subiection the disobedient: or by what other meanes hee should deale in keeping them in obedience. For albeit that hee bee a legitimate and absolute Lorde, not attempting anie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> thing contrarie to the lawe, yet it is necessarie for him to haue a power, whereby to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue and mainetaine the sacred Lawes. But it may bee it is no hard matter to decide this doubt in regard of such a King: for hee must needes haue a power alwayes in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, but such a power that may bee stronger then euery one in perticular, or many to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and yet weaker then the whole multitude. Such guards did the auncients giue to him whome they created their AEsymnete, as they tearmed him, that is to say, their Tyrant. And Dionysius demaunding of the Syracusians a guard for his defence, a certaine man counselled them to appoint him one of that quantity.</hi>

               <p>To the foure former kindes of Kingdomes is adioyned a fift, which is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie called a Kingdome, where the weale publicke is administred at the Princes will, with regard had to the generall profite and commoditie of the subiects.

But relinquishing such a forme of kingdome which may bee in euery state, the Philosopher resteth himselfe principallie vpon the perfect and absolute royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, disputing whether it is better to bee gouerned by good Lawes, or by a good man. They which preferre a good man before good lawes, doe lay the cause vpon this, because it is impossible to ordaine by lawes that which is principally iust, but onely that which is vsually so, the affaires and common dealing of men being so incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> and so changeable, that it cannot bee otherwise: albeit that the vniuersall reason of the law ought to be well vnderstood of the gouernours of a Commonweale. They againe which preferre good Lawes before a good man, say that the Lawe is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out affections, wherewith the minde of man is sore disturbed; as anger, feare, ambition, auarice, hatred, and such like, which peruerte men placed in seate

But because both of these parts bee true, hee proceedeth to dispute, whether it be better to be gouerned by one good man, or by a multitude? Which question is interde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated, <hi>pro &amp; contra,</hi> affirmatiuely and negatiuely, as well in this Chapter, as in the next, where it is resolued and discussed.

And they which serued and ministred vnto them, were not slaues, or of a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> condition, whether they were borne and brought vp in the house, or brought from elsewhere: but onely the sonnes of Nobles and Princes, of the age of twentie yeares, instructed in all Sciences of learning, were deputed for the seruice of the kings, to the end that the king being stirred <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> by the view of those that were about him, might keepe himselfe from committing any thing worthie of reproch: And surely it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not sildome, that great Lords become wicked and corrupt, especially when they haue seruants and ministers to flatter and applaud, and set forward their sensuall desires and affections. There were certaine appointed and set houres both by night and day, wherein the king was bound to doe that which the lawe permitted. The king ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> in the morning, the first thing that hee was to doe, was to receiue all the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and petitions which were presented vnto him, to the end, that by giuing an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere to necessarie matters, all his affaires might bee marshalled in good order, and by discretion. This done, after that hee had washed his bodie before the Princes of his kingdome, attiring himselfe with rich and costly robes, hee went to the Temple, to offer sacrifice to the gods. And there this was the custome of the Arch-prelate or cheefe Priest, that after the oblations and sacrifices offered vpon the Altar, the king being present, to pray with a lowd voice in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the people, for the health, prosperitie, and good fortune of the said king, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> who obserued and executed iustice amongst his subiects. And then the Arch-priest recounted seuerally the vertues of their king, both howe hee vsed obseruaunce, and religion in the seruice of the gods, and gentlenesse and courtesie towards men: and further that hee was a continent, iust, magnanimious, true, and liberall Prince, refraining his lustes, punishing malefactors with a more easie and remisse punishment then the greatnesse of their offence and misdeeds required, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pencing his subiects with greater rewards and fauours, then their vertues meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And then after all this thus spoken, he pronounced a bitter curse and male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction against all wicked ones, excusing and purging the king from all blame, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> and laying the fault if there were anie, vpon his seruaunts, that counselled and persuaded him to such vnreasonable thinges. This done, the saied Arch-prelate exhorted the king to a happie life, conformable to the gods, and likewise to ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and good conditions, and to practise not that which wicked men counselled him, but that which appertained to honour and vertue. And finally, the king hauing sacrificed a Bull to the gods, the Priest did reade out of a certaine holie booke, certaine noble exploits and enterprises of great and excellent personages,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:7218:104"/>
to the end, that after their example, the king by imitation might learne to vse his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> authoritie and domination iustly and vertuously. Neither was the time onely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by the auncient Lawes, wherein the King should exercise himselfe about the matters of his owne treasures and reuenue, and the controuersies of his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, but also the time to walke and to bath, to lye with his wife, and of all other exercises. These kings liued vpon a verie simple diet, as of Veale, and Geese, for all their messes. As touching Wine, there was a certaine measure expressely appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, which they might not passe, to glut and make themselues drunke withall: yea and the whole order and course of their diet was so limitted and moderated, that it seemed rather to haue beene ordained by some expert Phisitian, then by any wise <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> Law-giuer. And sure this is a thing deseruing admiration, that the kinges of AEgypt liued not at their pleasures like other Kings, but onely according to the ordinance of the lawe: but this is more straunge and admirable, that they had no power nor authoritie to iudge, to collect subsidies, or to punish any man through anger or anie other vniust occasion, but were altogither like priuate persons, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the Lawes: and yet they endured it patientlie, esteeming it the cheefest happinesse that could betide, to bee obedient to such ordinances and constitutions: for those that did otherwise, and liued at their owne pleasure, they thought them miserable, by being subiect to so much daunger and hurt, as vsually accompanieth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> such actions. And in truth, they which often offend willingly, are ouercome ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with friendship, or euill will, or some other passion of the mind, or doe stray of set purpose out of the right path: but othe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Therefore the kings of AEgypt exercising such bountie and lenitie towards their subiects, gained so much their loue and obedience, that not onely the AEgyptian Priests, but also the whole multitude of common people, had more care and regard of the safetie and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the king, then of their owne wiues and children, yea then of all the rest of the Princes of the land.

Also those costlie buildings which the AEgyptian people erected to their Kinges after their deaths, are ample witnesses of the good will and loue which they bore vnto them; insomuch, that they honoured them not onely whilest they liued, but also when <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> they were dead: for whensoeuer anie of their kinges came to the point of death, all the people with one eye and voice wayled and lamented exceedinglie, they tore their garments, and the Temples being shut, they neither frequented the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, nor anie publicke places, nor celebrated anie feastes or solemnities, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smearing their heads with durt for the space of threescore and twelue dayes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing girded about, both men and women with sheetes, of whome, to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of two or three hundred, enuironned the kinges corpes twise a day, reitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their greefe, and recounting his vertues in Epitaphes and songes.

And after that in this time of mourning, all thinges requisite for the obse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies and funerals were prepared: the last day they put the dead bodie into a

Whereupon it hath come to passe, that many kings of AEgypt (by reason of the resistance of the multitude) haue beene depriued of the honor and magnificence due vnto their funerals, the feare whereof hath compelled these kings to liue iustly, least after their death they should incurre the euerlasting indignation &amp; hatred of their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> subiects.

               <p>THE <hi>beginning of the question is, Whether it bee more expedient for a Commonweale to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> bee administred by a good man, or by good lawes.</hi>] Many are of this mind, that the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement of men ought not to bee committed to one alone, but that it is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to search out a more diuine thing, to take charge of men, as is easie to coniecture by the example of many sorts of brute beastes. For amongst sheepe, one sheepe dooth not gouerne the whole flocke; and amongst Horses and Oxen, one Horse or Oxe doe not gouerne the whole Heard: but man is hee, that excelling and being more Noble <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> then all other creatures, hath the conduct and guidance of brute beastes: whose worth, how much it surpasseth all other vnreasonable creatures, is notoriously knowne. By the like reason (if wee desire to haue matters succeede according to our wils) it is meete that some thing more excellent then man doe gouerne the societies of men. But because in all the world there is not a gouernour to bee found, more noble or better then man, and that also man is a creature of great variety, composed of diuerse parts, forasmuch as by the inferiour faculties of the mind, hee hath a certaine commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with brute beastes, and by the superiour powers approcheth in some sort vnto the immortall gods: That part therfore of man which is diuine and immortall, ought <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to hold the raynes of gouernement amongst men, which according to the iudgement and opinion of all, is the vnderstanding, which is nothing els but a certaine beame of the heauenly light infused into the natures of mens mindes. Therefore it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee that a Commonweale should bee well prouided for, if the gouernement thereof bee committed to a man, who by the brutall faculties of his minde, is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten disturbed and diuerted out of the right way of reason: but it must bee commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to this pure vnderstanding, which is free from all disquietnesse and perturbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the minde. The which (when as by other meanes it could not bee done) seemeth to bee attained vnto through the prouidence of God, by the inuention of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> good Lawes: which is nothing else but to haue the charge of gouernment layed vpon the vnderstanding and reason, which are not subiect to the tempests of pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bations. To the which benefite and gift of the gods, I knowe not whither (if wee weigh the commodities and profite of them) any other bee equal, or any waies compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable: for first many wise men hauing conferred togither the examples of auncient times, concluded and determined after long consideration, that which seemed best in their iudgement for the enacting of lawes, without all feare of being diuerted from the truth, either by euill will, by friendship, or anie other perturbation of minde: seeing that in the constitution and making of Lawes, they doe not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> handle the particular cause of anie one, as it often happeneth in the deciding of controuersies, but of all in generall. Then the Lawes being thus enacted if any man bee found to offend, and constrained to indure the punishment or penaltie of his offence, hee cannot beare any grudge against the Lawgiuer, because hee knoweth he aimed not at him, but at all: and thus consequently, there is no cause to feare any sedition or rancour, which is the most perrillous staine and blot of a Commonweale that can be. As also on the contrarie side, it commeth to passe,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:7218:105"/>
when any is punished without the disposition of the law, many greeuous iarres and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentions <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> doe arise: for it is almost impossible but that wee should beare euill will vnto those, by whom we haue receiued hurt and dammage. Wherefore I knowe not whether Nature, the mother of all, hath bestowed a greater benefite vpon mankind, then the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention of the lawes, which from all antiquity hath alwaies ben ascribed and consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the immortall gods. To this purpose Aristotle before alledged, sayth in his booke of the World, dedicated to Alexander, That hee could find nothing in the world to the which hee might resemble God more fitly then to an ancient law in a well ordered Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. By the which sentence it appeareth, that in this vniuersality of causes, God is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els, but that which is an auncient law in a ciuill society. Hee sayeth further in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> same booke and next Chapter, that Law is a shining and bright intelligence, not infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with any spots of affection: whereby we may easily perceiue that to be true &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious which wee said before, that is, that some thing more diuine then man, sitteth at the sterne of humane societies to guide &amp; direct the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the right course. But if we prefer man before the lawes, to this charge of gouernement, then the case standes in far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter danger, because it is hard to find many adorned and enabled with wisedome, boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and honestie, fit for so great a place, but for the most part they all erre in iudgement, and goe astray from the truth, through the violent outrage of affections. And if it were possible to find out a man so wise, good, and constant, that hee would by no blast of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> bee turned aside from his dutie, yet notwithstanding (for this excellencie) it would not bee conuenient to preferre the rule of a man before the principality of the lawes, considering that in regard of his fraile and mortal nature, he could not long per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seuere in his duty without offence: whereas on the other side, the only lawes are able to ioine him to eternity. By this which hath beene spoken, it seemeth that the souerainty of gouernement ought to be recommended rather to the determination of the lawes, then to the discretion of man. But forasmuch as euery thing cannot be comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded within the lawes, it is necessary to commit some cases to the arbitrement of man, and to establish some one as a guardant, vicar and executioner of the lawes, who by the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> disposition and direction of them, may take vpon him the gouernement of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweale. But seeing that all cannot bee comprised by the lawes, and that it is needfull to haue a supreame Iudge for such causes as come in question: the same doubt ariseth againe, which seemed to haue beene resolued by the establishment of the lawes, to wit, Whether it be better to haue one alone, or a few, or rather the Communaltie to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the tuition of the lawes, and to giue iudgement in cases which are without the compasse of the lawes. Albeit that by many mens iudgements, the royall and regall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement is esteemed the most excellent of all others, and the cheefedome of one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, of greatest account for worth: Notwithstanding, because of the vnconstant mind <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> of man, &amp; pronenesse to encline to that side which is either not good, or the worse, and because of the breuity of his life, some suppose that the good estate of all ought not to bee reposed vpon such a gouernement, but rather that the cheefe rule should apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to the Communaltie, because there hath beene scarce any regall gouernement, which hath not beene soone transformed into a tyrannie. On the contrary, wee reade that many Commonweales or popular gouernements, haue continued a long time in a flourishing and triumphing estate both in peace and warre. But yet sure the multitude of it owne nature is very vnfit for gouernement, wherefore ciuill society maintained by concord and vnitie, will be quite defaced and broken, except it bee by some deuise redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> into an vniforme estate: wherupon it commeth to passe, that the wisest which haue learnedly written of ciuill institutions, determine that a Commonweale ought to bee tempered and mixed as it were of a Monarchie, an Aristocratie, and a Democratie, to the end, that by this mixture the discommodities of simple gouernements may bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoided, as it hath beene manifested by reasons and examples in the Annotations vpon the second booke of this worke, and fourth Chapter. Also that question is touched in

               <p>
                  <hi>NOw, whereas we haue discoursed of such a king as gouerneth all thinges at his owne becke and pleasure, we are to consider further of this matter. For he which is called to be a king lawfully, hee dooth not as we say, make a shew of a kingdome. For in all cities it may come to passe, that the Empire of warre may be perpetuall as it is in Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> or popular estate, and in Aristocratie, that is in the power of the Nobles, and many deferre to one the power of administring and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derating the Commonweale: for such an Empire is that of the Dyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rachij, and is in some part more strict then that of Opus. But wee are to speake of that kingdome,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> which in all respects is absolute and entire in it selfe. But it seemeth to be a thing against Nature that one should beare the whole sway of the Citizens, where the City consisteth of all equals. For they which bee like of Nature, it is necessary naturally that they should haue the same law &amp; dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: wherefore as to giue meate and equall apparrell to vnequall men, hurteth the bodies: so is it to be reputed of honours. In like sort, it is dangerous to distribute vnequall honours to men of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> equalitie. Wherefore it is no lesse iust, that these men rule then that they bee subiect to rule. And againe, it is iust that these men rule and obey alike. But this thing is the law: for the law is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of order. It is therefore more to bee wished, that the lawe beare the whole sway then any perticuler Citizen. Furthermore, by this sel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>esame reason, when some rule, these that rule, are only the keepers and executioners of the lawes: for it is necessary that there should be some Magistrates; but one man to rule, they denie to be iust, especially where all are equal. And now whatsoeuer it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the law cannot determine, that also falleth not into the knowledge of man: but after that the lawe hath accurately and diligently instructed men in, it deliuereth and committeth the rest to Magistrats to be iudged and decided by a most iust sentence and conscience. But furthermore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> whatsoeuer seemeth better to men that haue made triall, then that which the lawes written con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, it is permitted to amend. He therfore that would haue conscience or the mind to bee cheefe and beare rule, he seemeth to will that God and the lawes beare sway: but hee that would haue a man, addeth also a wilde beast. For the cupidity &amp; desire of man is brutish, and anger corrupteth Magistrates, yea euery man of the best sort. Wherfore the lawe is an intelligence deuoid of affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Further, that example taken from the Arts, seemeth to be false, to wit, to cure such men by precepts and bookes which are written of the Art of Phisicke, they helpe nothing, nor hurt anie thing. But on the contrary side, it is more fit to vse those that are artificers and learned men, and to vse their counsell and helpe: for these doe nothing that abhorreth from reason for friendship <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> sake, but hauing made men whole, receiue their reward: But those which are aduaunced to ciuill Magistracies, are wont to do many things vpon spight, and also vpon fauor, for if so be, the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions should be suspected that they were brought in by enemies, not to heale, but to kill for lucre sake, then had they rather bee cured by precepts of Art and bookes, then at the Phisitions plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. And Phisitions themselues when they are sicke, send for and vse other Phisitions: and the maisters of childrens exercises, when they are exercised themselues, vse other maisters of exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: as though they could not iudge and examine the truth, as also because they cannot iudge of
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:7218:106"/>
their owne matter: and because they being troubled, should come to iudge. Therefore it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> that they that seeke the law, seeke the meane betwixt both: for the law is the meane. Further, they haue greater authoritie, and the lawes consisting in manners, are of greater moment, then written laws. Wherfore a man which gouerneth a Commonweale, lesse faileth, and is lesse decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, then laws written: but not so as lawes gotten and confirmed by customes. And now truly it is not easie for one to see many things. It shall be therfore behoofeful to appoint many Magistrates. Wherefore what skilleth it whether this thing bee done straightway from the beginning, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one may place many after this sort ouer gouernment: furthermore, if a good man, as it is said before, because he is better then others, is worthy to rule, then shall two good men be better to rule then one good man. For this is it that Diomedes sayth in Homer: For when two go togither one <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> way. And that which Agamemnon wisheth in the same Authour: O if I had twice fiue such counsellors. And there are nowe Magistrates, who haue the arbitrement and authority of iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, as hath the Iudge of those things which the law cannot comprehend and define, because the law cannot command and iudge after the best sort. For in regard of those things which the lawe cannot determine, no man doubteth of them, but his authority ought to preuaile very much. But because some thinges may bee comprised within the lawes, and other things cannot: these thinges make it doubtfull and questionable, whether it bee better that the best lawe or the best man beare sway: for of those things that men consult, there can be no law made. No man therfore pleadeth a cause, but that it is necessary that there bee a man which is to iudge of causes: but they will not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> haue one alone but many, for euery Magistrate iudgeth well which is instructed in the lawe. But it may seeme per aduenture absurd, that any should see more accutely with two eyes, and hear more attentiuely with two eares him that iudgeth, and deale better, endeuouring with two feet and two hands, then many with many hands and feete. For now those Princes which rule alone, which the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Grecians call Monarchs, labour to haue many eyes about them, many eares, many hands, &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny feet: for they that fauour their dominion and them, these they make their fellowes in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. If therefore they be not friends, their actions shall not bee approoued by the counsell of the Monarch. If they bee friends to him, then are they friends also to his Empire. And a friend is one that is equall and alike. Wherefore, if he thinketh them meete to rule, then bee thinketh that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> Peeres and equals equally ought to reigne. Those things therefore, which certaine dissenting from others dispute against a kingdome are in a maner these. But these things perhaps are true in some cases, though not so in other: for there is a certaine kind of men, apt by Nature to beare maister<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like authority, another to royall authority, another to ciuill society, and to euery one of these, one thing is a law, another thing profitable. But the tyrannicall gouernement is against Nature, and so is euery other forme of gouerning a Commonweale, which swarueth from the right: for these things are done against Nature. But by those things which are spoken, it is manifest, that it is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther expedient nor iust, that amongst men of like condition and equals, one should haue the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of all the rest: and if there be not lawes, that he should be as a law; neither yet if there <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> be lawes. Neither that one good man should sway ouer many good men, nor one bad man ouer many bad men: neither if hee excell in vertue, but after a certaine manner. But what manner this is, must be expounded, although we haue in a manner discoursed of the same hereto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Such a multitude therefore is fit to vndergoe a royal Empire, which is so framed of nature, that it can brooke a stocke excelling in vertue, to beare ciuill principality. A multitude therefore is Aristocraticall, that is, fit to beare sway ouer free men: such as may be gouerned by free power of them that excell in vertue: referring their counsels to ciuil authority: &amp; that is a ciuil mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, in the which there is wont to be by nature one militarie multitude and warlike, which can <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> obey and rule according to law, for dignity and deserts de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For as it is said before, the matter is not only so by the course of law, the which they propound which instruct <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Commonweales, both Aristocraticall, Oligarchicall, and Democraticall: for all doe iudge, that

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> according to the rate of excellencie, honours and offices should bee deferred: (but all esteeme not excellencie to be one and the same, but some preferre this, and some that) and by that lawe which is before spoken of. For; forsooth it is not meet to desire the death of such a man, or his exilement, or his absence tenne yeares out of the Citie, nor that hee bee subiect to authoritie: for Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will not haue it that the part should excell the whole. But to him whose excellencie is so great, this happeneth. Wherefore it remaineth onely, that such a Citizen to whome the rest are to yeelde obeysance, haue the iudgement and gouernement of all thinges, not for his owne part, or by course, but simplie. Of a kingdome therefore, howe manie differencies there are, and whether it bee expedient for Cities or no, and to what Cities it is expedient, and after <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> what sort, let it be thus defined and declared by vs. And because wee say there are three formes of gouerning a Commonweale, of these it is necessarie that this is the best, which is gouerned by the best men: and that is such a one wherein it happeneth that some one excelleth all, or a whole kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And in the former bookes it is shewed of vs, that the same vertue ought necessarily to be in a good man, that is in a good Citizen in a good Citie, it is manifest after the same order, and by the same Arts, that there may be a good man and a citie ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, whether it be of a few Noblemen and famous for vertue gouerned, or whether it bee go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned by the Empire of one king. Wherefore there shall bee the same institution, and the same <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> conditions which shall make a good man and a politicke man, and one fit to reigne. These things thus defined and declared, wee are to endeuour to speake of the best forme of administring a Commonweale, and after what manner the nature thereof may arise, and be by a certaine means ordained: for it is necessary to comment and dispute thereof conueniently, and as the matter requireth.</hi>

The ancient estate of Persia became like to these vnder Cambises, Xerxes, &amp; other kings, euen vntill the last Darius, who reduced it into extreame bondage and slauery,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> more neer to a tyranny the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a kingdome, depriuing it of that mutual amity which ought to be amongst Princes and subiects, and that politicke communion which is requisit to the preseruation of euery Commonweale: in such sort, that though hee bore rule ouer an infinite multitude of men, yet he could put no confidence in them, hauing made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnfit for warfare, but was constrained in time of warre to vse the helpe of mercenary souldiors and strangers.

When the greatest number of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are a confused multitude, and ignorant of warfare, and as dissolute in war, so more prone to bondage then our seruants. And as for the most honorable and famous of them, they neuer liued a ciuill, popular, or politicke life, but euer so behaued themselues, that they insulted ouer some like lords, and serued others as bondmen, being men of most cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt dispositions: their bodies they decke and adorne for riches sake, but in their minds they tremble by reason of authoritie, for euen they waite at the pallace gate of the Prince, and lye downe and humble themselues most basely at his feet, &amp;c. This cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt discipline and manner of the Persians, is found fault withall by Xenophon in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> end of his Paedia, and noted by Q. Curtius, and Plutarch, and Herodotus, in diuerse pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. And it is most certaine, that the king of Persia, who for a time was the greatest po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentate in the world, by vsurping a more absolute authority, then was meete, spoiled his estate, by tyrannizing too much ouer his subiects, whom hee esteemed no better then bondslaues, as Plutarch reporteth: and at last vtterly ruinated it, euen then when he sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed that he had aspired to the top of worldly prosperity, the spring of pride and arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance. Such is the estate of Turkie at this day, resembling much in many thinges the kingdomes of Persia and Parthia, and the Empire of Rome: ouer which the great Turke raigneth as sole Lord, vsing his subiects rigorously, as wel the Musulmans, as Christians <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> or Iewes, and seruing himselfe in his principal affaires both of war and peace, &amp; matters of gouernment, of abiured slaues that had renounced their faith, whom (as it hath been said before in the ninth chapter) hee placeth or displaceth, chaungeth, or deposeth, as it pleaseth him, without all danger or enuie, yea he causeth them to be strangled vpon the least suspition or discontentment that can arise, not sparing his owne children and kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of blood, if they anger him.

               <p>CONSIDERING <hi>that Monarchs make vnto themselues many eyes, eares, hands, and feet.</hi>]<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Xenophon in his eight booke of his Paedia sayth: That Cyrus neuer got vnto himselfe the true eies and eares of a king, but by his great liberality: for by rewarding diuerslie those that had brought him tidings of any thing that was profitable, he brought to passe within a short space, that euery one stroue to see and heare out many things, the report <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> wherof might benefit the king. From thence it arose, that men attribute vnto kings ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny eyes and eares, which are the two necessarie parts of defence for a man. And hee is greatly deceiued, that requireth in a king but one eye and one eare, for one can heare and see but few things. And if a king should commit the charge of all his affaires to one alone, others would become carelesse and negligent thereof, and all the world would looke at him onely which was reputed to bee the Princes eye. But it behoueth a king to listen to the reports of all such which say they haue seene or heard any thing worthy to be obserued. For this cause it is thought that kings haue many eies and eares, because in all places euery one feareth to do or say any thing against the king, as if hee continually <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> stood by to heare and see them. By meanes whereof, there was neuer any heard of, that spake euill of Cyrus, but all were so affected to speake wel of him, as if his eies and eares had been present in all places. And hereof I can render no better a reason, but that for small seruices he rendred alwaies great benefites.</p>
               <p>WHEN <hi>therefore it shall happen, that either a whole kindred, or any one person shall arise <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> so, exceeding the rest in vertue, that hee surpasseth all others, then is it iust, that this bee the royall linage, and that this person haue power ouer all, and be an absolute king.</hi>] Aristotle Politicke <hi>lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. saith thus: Peraduenture men esteeme it an excellent thing to beare rule ouer all, forasmuch as by this meanes a man may be able to performe many honest &amp; iust ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> so that he that is able to gouerne, ought not to lay the burthen of gouernement vpon anothers shoulders, but rather take it from another, without regard had on the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers part of his children, or on the childrens part of their father, or of one friend to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: for that which is good, is most desirable, and to doe well is good. Nowe they that speake thus, possibly say true, if that which is most desirable, could happen to spoilers &amp; destroyers of Countries, which cannot indeed happen vnto them, and therefore they presuppose a false ground: for such a one cannot performe vertuous and honest acts, if so bee hee doe not so farre excell all others, as a man doth a woman, or a father his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Wherefore an offender cannot succeed so well in well doing, because hee is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> farre from vertue. For there is an intercourse of honestie and iustice betwixt equals in bearing rule by turnes, for this is inequality; but an inequality amongst equals, and a dissimilitude amongst those that are like, is contrary to nature: and that which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to nature cannot bee honest. If therefore any other bee found excelling the rest in vertue, and ability to performe good deeds, it is an honest thing to yeeld vnto him, and a iust thing to obey him, for he ought to haue not onely vertue to work, but also power wherewith to worke. Therefore such persons that so much excell others in generositie, vigour of mind and bodie, as the soule dooth the body, or a man dooth the brute beastes, are by reason of their excellencie worthie to command as kings, and to haue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> absolute dominion ouer all. Such were Cyrus, Alexander, Iulius Caesar, Octauian, Charlemaigne, and others like vnto them, who farre surpassed the vertue, felicitie, and common reputation of other Princes, whome wee must not thinke to haue beene sent by chaunce into this world, but by the will of God, who adorned them with so many rare and excellent vertues, and exalted them to so high a pitch of honour and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to the end, to giue order to humane affaires, to correct the abuses of men, to found Monarchies and Empires, and to bring in good ordinances and lawes, to promote Arts

The Medes (sayeth he) inhabiting townes and villages, amongst them there was found one Deioces, a man highly reputed of in his territorie, and who applying <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> his heart to iustice, executed the same most carefully: And albeit, that throughout all the countrey of Medea, the bridle was let loose to all licentiousnesse and libertie, yet hee well knowing that iustice was an enemie vnto vice, behaued himselfe so notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing: which the inhabitants of his Town vnderstanding, chose him for their iudge. In which estate (as one that longed after dominion) hee demeaned himselfe so iustly and vprightly, and gained to himselfe so great reputation, that the other Townes began to vnderstand howe that Deioces was the onely man in the Countrey, that gaue iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment according to right and equitie. Wherefore they flocked vnto him to haue iustice on all sides, because of the vniust sentences and wrongs which they had before sustai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> and at last it came to that passe, that they came to none but him, yea that euery day a great multitude flocked to him in regard of his vpright dealing. But when hee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued that all the Countrey relied vpon him, then hee would no longer keepe Court in his accustomed place, nor exercise the office of a Iudge, alleadging that by imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himselfe to distribute iustice vnto others<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> hee neglected his owne affaires, and so endammaged himselfe. Then againe, robberies, ryots, and insolencies rebudded amongst the Medes more then before. To preuent the which mischeefes, they assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled togither, and disputed of the prouision of offices: at what time, in mine opinion the friendes of Deioces spake most brauely. For, maisters (saied they) if wee will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> liue in that kinde of life which wee nowe lead, it is impossible for vs to remaine any longer in this Countrey: Wherefore wee aduise to establish a king amongst vs, which is the onely meanes to prouide, that our Countrey may bee iustly and vprightly gouerned, and to returne vs backe to the discharge of our charges: and so it will come to passe, that wee shall not bee any more destroyed and ruined by our peruerse conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. With these speeches, they stirred vp this persuasion, that a king was needefull. This dore being opened, presently euery one bethought them of Deioces, and extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him so greatly, vntill by one consent hee was chosen and established for their king. This done, hee commaunded them that they should helpe to build him a house fit for a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> king, and designe him a guard for his safetie. The Medes presently layed to their indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struous hands, and erected for him a great and strong castle in the place which hee had marked out, and suffered him to chuse whome hee would to bee of his guard. Hee perceiuing himselfe thus confirmed king, constrained the Medes moreouer to build him a Cittie, and to furnish it royally with all thinges necessary. They obey, and builded at his direction high and strong wals, enclosed within each other, which at this day are called Ecbatanes. The description of the building is on this manner, one of the wals is not higher then the other, except in the prospects or Turrets: The scituation of the place helpeth much, being found vpon a little hill: but that which most sheweth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> their industrie is this, that there are seuen inclosures of wals, enuironned one within another. Within the last and least of them is the kings pallace, where all the treasures are preserued, the widest of them is as large as the whole Citie of Athens. The Turrets of the first enclosure, are enamelled with white, of the second with blacke, of the third with carnation, of the fourth with azure, of the fift with Orange tawney, of the sixt and seuenth, the one with siluer, and the other with golde. Deioces (all thinges being
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:7218:108"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> thus performed) commanded the people to lodge round about the Citie: &amp; afterwards hee was the first that ordained, that none should date to present himselfe before the King, but by his huishers and messengers, also that none should bee so bold, as to looke the King on the face, and that it should bee accounted a base and dishonest part, either to laugh or spit before the King. The Medes doe most willingly obserue all these Lawes, to the end, that those which are of the same age with the King, and haue beene brought vp with him as men of worth, in looking vpon him, should not bee discontented, and so conspire against him. These decrees thus decerned by Deioces, thinking that nowe his state was most sure and setled, hee began to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> rigorous in iustice, and commaunded, that from that time forward, they should send him their sutes in writing, to giue iudgement vpon them so, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne them to the parties againe, and so he administred iustice. To conclude, he ordained, that if any should enterprise anie thing against his Maiestie, hee should bee called before him, to receiue punishment answerable to the qualitie of his offence: and to the end hee might bee still aduertised of such dealings, hee had his spies and intelligencers in euery corner of his kingdome, to giue him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice thereof. After this manner, Deioces brought vnder subiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Nation of the Medes, and made himselfe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> their King and Lord.</p>

And as hee had before diuided a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome into many kinds, so here hee deuideth the Democratie, and Oligar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie, Aristocratie, and Tyranny, into their kinds also: declaring in like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner why there are many kinds of them: not that this latter deserueth to be numbred among Common-vveales, but to the end that this politicke dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> may be more accomplished.

For it is necessarie that that which declineth from the cheefest and most diuine, bee the very worst. But a Kingdome of necessitie either hath the name of a Kingdome onely, when it is indeed no King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: or for the great excellencie of him which beareth rule, it is manifest. Wherefore a Tyranny, which is the worst, is farthest differing from this forme of gouernement of a Commonweale.

                  <hi>THat therefore there are many kindes of Common-weales, the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> cause is, in that there are manie parts of euery Cittie. First, wee see all Citties to consist of faculties, and then in this multitude, it is necessarie that some bee poore, and some rich, and some betwixt both: and againe, amongst rich and poore men, that some be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to armes, others to peace: and of the people, that some bee Husbandmen, others Marchaunts, and others Artificers. There is also a difference among the Nobles, both in regard of their riches, and largenesse of their possessions, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> to keepe stables of horses, which cannot bee done without riches.

They vsed horses against their neighbour enemies, as the Etrerians, Chalci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, and Magnesians, dwelling neare to Meander, and many other people of Asia. Besides the difference of riches, there is another in regard of race, and another in regard of vertue, and what other thing els of like sort, which wee haue made a part of a Citty, when as we entreated of an Aristocratie, where wee declared howe many parts were necessarie in a Cittie. Sometimes all these parts are in a Commonweale: sometimes more of them, sometimes fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

kind: forasmuch as the parts of them differ after the same manner. For a Commonweale is the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> order and disposition of Magistrates which are distributed, either according to the power of them who are partakers of it, or according to some other common equality belonging to poore and rich, or some other thing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to both. It is therfore necessarie that there be so many Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monweales, as there are orders, according to the excellencies and differences of parts. But it seemeth, that prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally there are but two, as we say of the winds, that some are Northerne, &amp; some Southerne, &amp; the rest the excesses of these: so in Commonweales there are but two cheefe kinds, the Democratie and the Oligarchie: for they make the Aristocratie a branch of Oligarchie, as if it were a kinde of Oligarchie; and that other which is properly a Commonweale, to bee a braunch of the Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratie, as in the windes they referre the Southwest and Southeast, all to the South. The like is to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> be obserued in harmonies of Musicke, as some say, wherof they make two kinds, the Dorian, and the Phrigian, and call all other consorts, compounds of these two. So they are woont to esteeme of Commonweales, but it is both truer and better, as we haue said, that there being two right forms, or one, that all the other be transgressions, as in Musick of good harmonie, so here of a good Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweale: and that those be Oligarchicall, which are more seuere and lordly: and those Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craticall, which are more gentle and remisse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The cause why there are many formes of Common-weales, and many braunches of euery forme, is, because in euery Cittie there are many parts, by the diuersity whereof,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> the gouernments also are made diuerse, so that they are sometimes held by one part, &amp; sometimes by another, it being not possible through humane inconstancie, that they should remaine alwaies in one stay: for some are rich, others poore, a third sort in a meane estate: againe, some are armed, others disarmed, others tillers of the ground, Artificers and Merchants. In like manner, Noblemen are distinguished according to the diuersity of Countries, by stocke, wealth, vertue, and learning. Notwithstanding, all these parts whereof the totall is composed, do not make this diuersity, but only those parts which belong to the forme and essence of the state: as Artificers, and other such base persons doe not properly diuersifie the gouernment, but those which appertaine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> to the forme and essence thereof, as poore and rich, noble and vertuous, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d such like. Seeing therefore that a Commonweale is the order of Magistrateships, and that such parts doe communicate the estate in greater or lesser number: necessarily, there must needs be so many kinds and sorts of Commonweales, as there are differences in that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. All which kinds may be reduced into two, to wit, an Oligarchie, and a Democratie, as all the winds are reduced to two cheefe, Boreas and Auster, called now adaies by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners, the North and the South; and all the harmonies of musick are reduced to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian &amp; the Phrigian: so that as all other tunes are transgressions of these two, so all other Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monweales do seem to be transgressions of a Kingdome &amp; an Aristocratie, the most <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> seuere &amp; lordly, resembling Oligarchies, &amp; the most licentious and mild, Democraties.</p>

                     </gap>, and few rich: for if offices should be bestowed according to the greatnesse of stature, as some say was woont to bee done in AEthiopia, or according to beauty, it would bee an Oligarchie: forasmuch as there are but few faire and great: Notwithstanding, it is not sufficient to limit Common-weales by such things, but seeing there are many kinds of people and Oligarchies, wee must set downe this, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that it is not a Popular estate, if a fewe free men command ouer many that are not free, as in Auellone vpon the Ionicke sea, and in There: because that in these two Cities the honours and offices were in the hands of the most noble, and the first inhabitants, which were but a handfull among many. Neither should it bee a Popular estate, if the rich should surmount in multitude, as it was in time past at Colophon: where the elders of the City possessed great inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritances before that warre which they waged with the Lydians. But this is a Democratie, when free men being poore, and of a greater number, are lords of the estate: and this is an Oligarchie when the rich and Nobles being few in number, haue the rule. Therefore that there are diuerse sorts of Commonweales, and why, it hath beene thus declared. Now it followeth, that wee vnfold <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> why there are more kindes yet then haue ben named, and what they are, returning to our former beginning: for wee confesse, that euery City hath not one onely part but many: as if wee would set downe the sorts of liuing creatures, wee should diuide first all that which necessarie belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to a liuing creature in generall, as the sensitiue Organs, and the pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If therefore there bee so many kinds of necessarie members onely, and they all differing from each other, as for example, many kinds of mouths and bellies, and moouing members: the number of their coniunction must needs make diuerse kinds of li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ing creatures: For it is not possible, that the same liuing creature should haue many differences of mouths, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> likewise of eares: so that taking the coniunctions of these parts which may bee taken, wee shall make as many kinds of liuing creatures, as there are coniunctions of necessary parts. The like to this is found in the forenamed Commonweales: for Cities doe not consist of one part, but of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, as it hath often been saied. Therefore one part is that multitude which is busied in prouiding vittailes, which are called Husbandmen: A second is a multitude of Artificers, exercising their trades, without whom a city cannot be inhabited: A third, of those that frequent mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, occupying themselues in buying and selling, and trafficking, and retailing: A fourth, of mercinarie hirelings: A <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For peraduenture it cannot <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> bee, that a city that serueth naturally, should deserue the name of a citie, seeing that a city is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient of it selfe: and if it serue it cannot haue that sufficiencie. The which is elegantly disputed by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Plato in his Common-weale, though not sufficiently: For Socrates saith, that a Cittie is compounded of foure necessarie kindes of people, which are the Weauer, the Husbandman, the Tailor and the Builder. Afterwards, as if these were not sufficient, hee addeth thereunto the Smith, and the feeders of all necessarie cattel: after, the Merchant, and engrosser or retailer: all which things doe per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As touching men of warre, he doth not attribute their part vnto the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> before that the territories thereof being enlarged, &amp; already extended vnto their neighbors, they vndertake warre. Neuerthelesse, it behoueth that in all these four parts, and all others, there bee alwaies some one to deuide the law, and decide controuersies. If therefore the soule ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to bee esteemed a part of the creature, then the body; sure such as these are rather to bee reckoned parts of a citie, then those that belong to necessary vse, I meane the military and iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging part, and those of the counsell, which is a worke of ciuile wisedome: neither maketh it any matter in regard of this speech, whether these be separately in some me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or iointly in the same:
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:7218:112"/>
for oftentimes it falleth out, that the same men are Souldiors and Plowmen. Wherefore if both <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> these and those are parts of a City, it is no doubt, but that Souldiours are necessary parts thereof. The seuenth part is of those who helpe and sustaine the Commonweale with their wealth, called rich men. The eight, of those that manage the publike charges, and exercise the offices, forasmuch as a Citty cannot bee without Magistrates. Therefore it is requisite that there be foure which are capable of gouernement, to discharge this office in the City, either continually, or by course: and also such as we spake of but lately, to wit, Counsellors and Iudges. If therefore these things are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in cities well and iustly administred, there must needs also bee required some that are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of vertue, concerning matters of state. Nowe, some are of opinion, that diuerse faculties may be in the same persons, as the same men to be Souldiors, Plowmen, and Artificers, yea and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> also Counsellors and Iudges. All these doe ascribe vertue vnto themselues, and thinke themselues worthy to beare many offices, but it is impossible that the same persons should bee both rich and poore: Wherefore the poore and rich seeme to be principally the parts of a Citie. Moreouer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that commonly the one of these are few in number, the other many, they seeme to bee parts that are contrary to the parts of a citie, so that they doe frame and erect Common-weales accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their excesse; and so seeme to be double, a Democratie and an Oligarchie. That therefore there are many Commonweales, and for what causes there are so, it hath beene already declared. Let vs now also make manifest, that there are many sorts of Democraties &amp; Oligarchies, which neuerthelesse is manifest already by that which went before, for there are many sorts of people, &amp; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> many kinds of Nobles. The Husbandmen make one sort of people, Artificers another, Merchaunts that occupie buying and selling, a third; those that frequent the seas, a fourth; of whome some also follow the war, others seeke for lucre, some are posts and carriers, others fishers: for in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces there is a great multitude of such people, as in Tarentum and Bizance of fishers, in Athens of gally slaues, in AEginum and Chio of Merchants, in Tenedos of Carriers: also Handicraftsmen, and those that possesse so little goods, that they are not allowed to bee idle, the fift: and lastly, those which are not free men by both sides, and any other such like multitude of people. That kinds of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen are distinguished by riches, linage, vertue, learning, and other such like things of the same <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> difference. Therefore the first Democratie is that which consisteth principally in equality, for the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> law of such a Democratie noteth equality, forbidding that the rich, and that neither the one nor the other exercise any lordship, but that the condition of both be alike: for if liberty and equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity be principally in a Democratie, as some thinke, it shall bee then especially, when as all partake of the Commonweale alike. But because the people is superiour in number, and that that which pleaseth the most, is alwaies ratified, it must needs be, that this must be a popular estate: this then is one kind of Democratie. Another, is where Magistracies are conferred according to riches, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be but small, so that it may be lawfull to the possessor of riches to accept of them, and not to him that shal be without them. Another kind of Democratie is, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as euery citizen with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reproch may pertake of the gouernment, the law notwithstanding bearing cheefe authority.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> Another is, when as euery one may become a Magistrat, so that he be a citizen, and that the lawe haue the cheefe preheminence. Another is, where all other things abiding in the same stay, the multitude ruleth, and not the law<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> which is done when the decrees of the multitude preuaile, and not the law, by means of the guiders of the people: for in Democraties which are gouerned by law, there is no cheefe guider and conducter of the people, but the best Citizens hold there the cheefest place; but where the laws do not bear rule, there they make vnto themselues guiders and captains. For when one is set vp out of many, then the people beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth a monarch, because many are lords, not as it were separately, but rather altogither as one. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as Homer saith, that it is not good that many should gouern: whether he means this gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, or some other, where many gouern a part <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> euery one by himselfe, it is vncertain. Therfore such a people, as if it were a Monarch, seeks to bear rule alone, refusing to be subiect to the law, and so becometh a lordly forme of gouernment, in such sort, that flatterers are there in great estimation, &amp; such a people is in gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t most like a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, because in both, there raign the like co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditions, &amp; both co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand their betters: &amp; the popular decrees are like vnto the Tirants co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, &amp; the ringleader of the people, &amp; flatterer &amp; fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> towards the people. They are causers &amp; procurers, that decrees are preferred before laws: reducing by this means al vnto the wil of the people, &amp; so exalting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, by reason that the people being cheef lord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, they haue their wils at their directions, they being obedient vnto them. Further, reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting all lawful Magistrats, they affirm, that only the people ought to sit in iudgement, who listen to their exhortation, so that all the offices are quite peruerted. Hee therefore, that tearmeth this estate a Democratie, and not a Commonweale, seemeth to reproue it most worthily: for where the law beareth no sway, there is no Commonweale: seeing that the lawe o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ght to rule in all generall causes, and the Magistrate and Commonweale decide particular cases. Wherefore, if a Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratie is one forme of Commonweale, without doubt such a constitution where all is gouerned by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> decrees and not by lawes, is not properly a Democratie, forasmuch as no decree can be vniuersall. And thus much concerning the kinds of a Democratie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Democratie is a forme of Commonweale, where free men and those that are poore, being more in number, are Lords of the estate: An Oligarchie, where rich and noble men being few in number, haue the gouernment. Now, as diuerse kinds of liuing creatures are distinguished by the coniunction of diuerse parts, as of mouths, throates, bils, bellies, feet, pawes, tallons, winges, hands, eyes, eares, noses. So by the assembling togither of diuerse parties in Citties, arise diuerse formes of Common-weales. Nowe, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the parts of Citties are eight, to wit, Husbandmen, Artificers, Marchaunts, Hirelings, Sou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> a Cittie, of whom the said Oligarchies and Democraties are constituted. Againe, the Populacie is distributed into many parts, as into Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Artificers, Merchants, Marriners, Souldiours, Porters, Carriers, Fishers, Handi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craftsmen, and such like: and the Nobilitie into foure, distinguished by riches, linage, vertue, and knowledge. Therefore of these diuerse different parts assembled togither, are made diuerse different Commonweales, in such fort, that in a Democratie, there are fiue seuerall distinct kinds. The first, where the Commonweale is equally communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to all: the second, where regard is had to goods, though they be but smal: the third, where the law bearing sway, all the Cittizens partake of the gouernement: the fourth, where euery one may aspire to the Magist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Aristotle in the seuenth of his Politickes, chap. eight, writeth thus of the true parts of a Citty: First (sayeth hee) a Citty must haue victuals, next arts, and trades, because our life standeth in need of many instruments: thirdly weapons, things necessary for Cittizens, as well to preserue their estate, and chastice rebels, as to resist strangers, if they enterprise ought against them: Then a certaine competent quantity of money, to furnish both ciuile and warlike affaires: the fift and most principall thing is the obseruance of religion, which is called the Cleargie, or Priesthood: the sixt in number and most necessary of all, is the decision and iudgement of controuersies in rights and titles. These are the workes which are requisite in all Citties: for a Cittie is a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> multitude, and yet not euery multitude, but such a multitude as is of it selfe sufficient for the maintainance of life: and if any of these things be wanting, such a company cannot haue this sufficiency.

As therefore a weake and sickly bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy with any little outward alteration falleth soone into sicknesse, and sometimes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any outward cause, is at discord in it selfe: so an euill disposed Citty, vpon euery light occasion falleth sicke, and is at variance in it selfe, when as the people of a city that is ruled by an Oligarchie, or by a Democratie, seeke for helpe abroad from others: yea <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> also sometimes without forraine aid it entreth into sedition.

GLAVC. For that cause principally. SOCR. Nowe it is easie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> to find in this City a forme of gouernment. GLAVC. Why so? SOCR. Because that by reason of such absolute libertie, there are contained therein three kindes of gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and it seemeth necessarie for him that vndertaketh the constituting and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of a State, as wee not long since did, to repaire vnto some Cittie, the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereof is Democraticall or Popular, there to make choice of such a forme as best shall please him, as if hee were come to a faire of Commonweales: and after choise so made, to order and establish it.

GLAVC. I haue seene many such. SOCR. The cause <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> hereof is the too much sufferance therein vsed, with the want of all regard, and the neglect of those things which we recounted in constituting and ordering a Cittie, <hi>viz.</hi> that if any bee endued with an excellent naturall conceit, he will neuer prooue a good man, vnlesse euen presently from his infancie, hee be accustomed and enured to honest recreations, and continue such exercises, wholly supplanting all the rest.

               <p>The right of gouerning the Common-weale, is limitted in Oligarchies, by the valuation of euery particular Cittizens wealth. And as in auncient times were vsed foure kinds of valuations of goods, so are there also foure kindes of Oligarchies, as the wealth doth by degrees encrease. The first is, where publicke offices are giuen to rich men, enioying such a proportion of wealth, that they may exclud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> the poore from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, and because they are many in number, the Lawe beares rule amongst them. In the second kind there are fewer rich men, but such as possesse greater wealth, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in office, may of themselues chuse successours, or place new officers in the roomes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of those that die, or otherwise faile. But if the rich doe farther decrease in number, and encrease in wealth, then ariseth the third kind of Oligarchie, wherein the children suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed their fathers in publicke offices. Lastly, when the rich doe mightily encrease in wealth and friendships, then beginneth the fourth kind of Oligarchie, the gouernment whereof is not according to the Lawes, but all is there ordered by the will and pleasure of those that are wealthiest. And this fourth kinde is called a Dynastie, resembling the Tyrannicall State, and the last kinde of Democratie. This order of foure hundred hath beene obserued by Plato in his sixt booke of Lawes in the election of Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours or Senators, and by Solon in the establishing of the Athenian Commonweale, as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Plutarch writeth in his life: and by the Romanes in disposing the honours of their state, though not in the same order as Aristotle doth here set it downe, but it hath beene di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersly vsed by all these, according to the Lawes and ordinances of their Countrey.

               <head>CHAP. VI. For vvhat cause there are many sorts of Democratie and Oligarchie.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>IT is then manifest by the discourse going before, that there are so many sorts of Democratie and Oligarchie: for it must needs bee that either all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> the aforesaid parts of the people participate in the Commonweale, or that some doe, and some doe not. When as then the Artificers, and others, that are meanely rich, gouerne the Commonweale, the gouernement thereof is according to the laws: For they must liue by their labour, and cannot bee idle; so that the lawe being made, they assemble not but for necessarie cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: and it is lawfull for others to bee admitted into the Commonweale, if they enioy so large a reuenue, as is prefixed and appointed by the lawes, whereas otherwise, if this were not lawfull, this sort Democratie should be Oligarchicall: this is for such respects one sort of popular gouernment, and it is impossible to liue idly without reuenues. The other is by the election of Magistrates,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> for it may be, that all are admitted into the Commonweale, if they bee not excluded by reason of their birth, and that notwithstanding, they onely participate in the publicke offices which haue sufficient maintenance for their estate without labour, and therefore the lawes beare rule in such a kind of Democratie. The third sort, is when all that are free, may bee admitted into the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweale, who neuerthelesse haue no authoritie of gouernment for the cause aforesaid: so as it is necessary that the law doe bear rule there also. The fourth sort of Democratie is that which hath lately ben inuented in cities. For by reason that cities are waxed greater then they were at the beginning, and for that there is in the same plenty of reuenues, all men are partakers of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweale, by occasion that the multitude excelleth, who communicate and gouerne, because the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> poore wil be idle, when they receiue wages or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ipend. The which multitude is indeed very idle, for the care of their priuate affaires dooth let them neuer a whit, which so greatly turneth the rich aside, that often they come not into the assemblies nor seats of iudgement. By this means the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweale is brought vnder the gouernement of the poore, and not in the power of the lawes. So many and such be the kinds of the Popular state through these causes. As for the Oligarchie, when many men haue goods, howbeit in smaller quantity, and not very great, it is a kinde of the first Oligarchie, for they giue leaue to the possessor to be a gouernour there. And for that there is a multitude of those that participate in the gouernment, the law and not the men must rule. For sith they be farthest from the Monarchie or rule of one man alone, and haue not such ability, as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> that they can liue idly without care, nor so smal substance, that they must haue releefe of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweale, they will rather haue the lawe to gouerne then themselues. But if there bee fewer that posses<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And hee doth sometimes become so in this manner: When any body is son to a rich father, (dwelling in a Citie not wel gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) who shunneth Honours, Offices, Iudgements, and all such troublesomenesse and dooth willingly submit himselfe to others, that hee may so bee ridde from businesse. GLAVC. Howe then becommeth hee so? SOCR. When this boy I say, heareth his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther complaine, that her husband is no Magistrate, and that therfore she is not accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted off among other women; and when hee sees her offended with his father, because hee is little giuen to the getting of wealth, vsing no dealings either in priuate or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> whereby to enrich himselfe, but neglecting all such courses, and following onely his owne humour, without making anie great account of his wife, yet not despising her; who conceiuing thereat great indignation, tels the boy that his father is not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie to haue the name of a man, but that hee is too lazie and cowardly, with other such tales as women are wont to tattle. ADIMAN. Without question such women are wont to babble so. SOCR. You know also, that the seruants and they of the house, such I mean as are more affectionate to the Mistresse part, doe priuily buzze such tales into chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens eares: And if they see that any one hath wronged the father, who for quietnesse sake seekes not to redresse it by lawe, they counsell the boy to reuenge himselfe of such <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> persons, when hee shall growe more in yeares, and to shewe himselfe more like a man then his father. Besides, hee going abroad, heares other like speeches, and sees that they who trouble not themselues in the Cittie with ought els saue their owne priuate busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, are called sots, and had in no account, whereas those of contrarie humours are prais<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Besides, the rich seeme to haue that whereby men are inuited or allured to commit euill, and in this respect they are called vertuous and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.

Likewise the administration of lawes is not good, though they bee well ordained, vnlesse they be obeyed. Wherfore this is one good point in the ordinance of lawes, that men obey them, being ordained: Another is, that the Lawes bee well ordained and obeyed, because men may obey those lawes also that are not well ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> which commeth to passe in two manners, either when they are conditionally good, or simplie good. Now that seemeth cheefely to be an Aristocratie, wherein honours are bestowed for vertue, sith the end of the Aristocratie is vertue; of the Oligarchie, riches, and of the Democratie, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie: and this is common to them all, that the greater number of opinions preuaileth.

For the mixture of rich and poore men, hath regard onely to riches and libertie, sith for the most part men seeme to haue the place and reputation of vertuous men. Now as there are three things in the Commonweale which contend for equalitie, to wit, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> riches, and vertue (for the fourth which is called Nobilitie, followeth or dependeth on the two last, because Nobilitie, is auncient riches and vertue) it is certaine, that the mixture of these two, that is, of rich and poore men, is to bee called a Commonweale; and the mixture of three, an Aristocratie, I meane that kind of Aristocratie which followeth the true and first kind. Thus it hath beene shewed by vs, that there are other sorts of Commonweales besides the Monarchie, the Democratie and Oligarchie. We haue likewise declared what sorts they are, and how the Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stocraties differ among themselues, as also those formes of gouernement which encline or bend to an Aristocratie, and that they are not much vnlike.</hi>

Besides, because the two greatest offices are in the peoples handes, whereof they chuse the one, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and administer the other: for they elect the Senatours, and participate in the state or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Ephori.

Now it is requisite, that in a Commonweale well composed, there bee both these, yet neither of them seeming to bee there, and that of it selfe it doe maintaine and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it selfe, not outwardly of it selfe, not by hauing many outwardly, who wish it well (for that may happen also to a corrupt Commonweale) but by hauing no part wholly in the Citie which desireth another forme of Commonweale.

                  <hi>WE will speake nowe of the Tyrannie, not for that it deserueth a long discourse, but that it may haue a place in this treatise, sith wee haue set it in the number of Commonweales. Wee haue in the former booke spoken of a Kingdome, where wee discoursed touching that State <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> which is chee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ely called so, to wit, whether it bee vnprofitable or profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for Citties, as also when, whereof, and howe it should bee establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed. In which place wee propounded two kinds of Tyrannie, because their power and the Kingdome are in some sort taken one for another, sith they are both lawfull: for some Barbarians chuse Monarchs with absolute power: and in times past there were among the auncient Grecians certaine Monarchs called AEsymnetae. These estates haue some differences among themselues, and they were royall and resembling the state of a Kingdome, both because they were lawfull, and because they signiorized ouer volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie subiects: and Tyrannicall, because they exercised their Kingly authoritie at their owne plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> without controule. The third kind of Tyrannie which seemeth to bee principally a Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, and is opposed to the State of a Kingdome, must necessarily bee a Monarchie, and dooth absolutely commaund and raigne ouer such as are equall, and all that are better; respecting his owne, and not the subiects profit, and therefore is not voluntarie: for no person that is free, dooth willingly endure such a state. There are then so many and such kinds of Tyrannie, for the causes aforesaid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Although the Tyrannicall State should not bee called a Common-weale, as it was said before, because the Lawes haue therein no authoritie, but all thinges are ordered at <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> the will and pleasure of the Tyran: neuerthelesse, it hath beene accustomed to be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred among the corrupt Commonweales. Nowe there is not one onely kind of Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, but there are many sorts thereof. For although the Kingdomes of the Barbarians, and the AEsymnetae of the Greeks, signorize ouer voluntary subiects, and lawfully; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in imitating the state of a kingdome: yet they are Tirannies, because they exercise lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rule ouer good men, or better then themselues. Notwithstanding, that is properly a Tyrannie wich doth forcibly raigne ouerfree men.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> THE <hi>third kind of Tyrannie, which seemeth to bee principally a Tyrannie, and is opposed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> to the state of a Kingdome.</hi>] Aristotle in the fift of his Politickes, chap. 10. Almost the same accidents doe grow in kingdomes and Tirannies, as we said, did chaunce in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweales: For the kingly state doth imitate the Aristocratie, and the Tyranny is made of the extreamest sort of the Oligarchie, and of the Democratie, and is therefore verie hurtfull to the subiects, for it is compounded of two corrupt Commonweales, retay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the transgressions and blemishes of them both. Moreouer, it will easily appeare,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:7218:120"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> that the beginning of Monarchies hath proceeded of contraries, for the Kingly State was first ordained for the defence of good men against the multitude: and the King was created out of the number of good men, according to the excellence of his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, or vertuous deedes, or of the stocke from whence hee came. The Tyran was created by the multitude, against the Noblemen, to the end, that they should not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse them, as is manifest by the euents and issues of things. For almost all Tyrans haue become so, through being Captaines and leaders of the people, hauing gotten credite by forging accusations against the Nobilitie. Then one sort of Tyrannies hath sprung vp in this manner, the Citties being already growne great. Others, of those <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that hauing beene Kinges before, haue violated the auncient customes of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, desiring to commaund more absolutely. Others, of such as haue beene cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen to the cheefest Offices: for in auncient times the people allowed long time to Magistracies and publicke charges. And others of Oligarchies, where they had cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen and preferred some one to great Offices, for to hold them in manner of soueraigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: for in all these manners they might easily vsurpe a Tyrannie, if they were but wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling thereunto, because some had alreadie the power of a Kingly estate, and others the honour, as Phidon in Argos, and others which made themselues Tyrans, hauing before kingly authoritie, and those of Ionia and Phalaris, the honour. Panecius among <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the Leontines, and Cypselus at Corinth, and Pisistratus at Athens, and Dyonisius at Syracusa, and others in the same sort, of Captaines of the people haue become Tyrans. So the Kingly State dooth resemble the Aristocratie, in that it is giuen accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the persons dignitie, or through his vertue, or birth, or honourable deedes, or through all these thinges together, and through power. For all those that haue well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued, or might well deserue of Citties and Countries, haue attained to this honour; some in defending them from bondage, as Codrus; others in setting them at libertie, as Cyrus; some for building a Cittie, or conquering a Countrey, as the Kings of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians and Molossians. The office of a King, is to see that the rich bee no way <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> iniuried, nor the multitude outraged. The Tyrannicall State (as hath beene often said) hath no respect to the publicke commoditie, vnlesse it bee for his owne peculiar profite: and the onely end or ayme of a Tyran, is pleasure; of a king, honestie. Wherefore the desire to exceede in money, is Tyrannicall; and to excell in honour, more kingly. The kings guard is of Cittizens, the Tyrans of strangers. That the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie hath the vices and corruptions of the Democratie and Oligarchie, it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest: of the Oligarchie, in that it chuseth riches for the onely end whereat it ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth: otherwise the guard and magnificence thereto requisite, could not be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained: likewise, in that it doth in no sort trust the multitude, and therefore takes their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> weapons from them. <hi>Item,</hi> the oppression of the people, the driuing them out of the Citadell, and forcing them to disperse themselues, is common to them both, as well to the Oligarchie, as to the Tyrannie. It taketh likewise of the Democratie, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of warre against the Nobles, the destroying of them by couert, or open meanes, and banishing them as aduersaries and enemies to that state, because they are the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours of conspiracies: when some will seeke to rule themselues, others refuse to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure subiection.

                  <p>SOCRATES. There remaineth yet to speak of that goodly Gouernment, and goodly Lord, called a Tyrannie, and a Tyran. GLAVCVS. It is true. SOCR. Well then my friend, what is the forme and manner of a Tyrannie, sith it is almost manifest that it springeth from the Democratie? GLAVC. Verie manifest SOCR. Doth not the Democratie spring from the Oligarchie in the same sort, that the Tyranny springs from the Democratie. GLAVC. As how? SOCR. That good which is cheeflie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> and aimed at in the Oligarchie, and by which it was established, was it not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessiue riches? GLAVC Yes. SOCR. Then the insatiable couetousnesse of wealth, and the neglect of all other things, through the desire of priuate gaine, doe ouerthrowe it. GLAVC. Yea verily. SOCR. In like sort, the insatiable coueting of that good which is most sought and set by in the Democratie, doth destroy it. GLAVC. What good is therein most set by? SOCR. Libertie, for you shall heare nothing so much extolled and esteemed in a Cittie, whose gouernement is populat: for which cause, that onely is the fittest place for a man to dwell in, who is naturally freeminded. GLAVC. Indeede Libertie is there highly prized and much spoken of. SOCR. Nowe,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> as I was about to say, doth not the insatiable coueting thereof, and the neglect of other thinges, chaunge this forme of gouernement, and constraine it to haue neede of a Tyrannicall state. GLAVC. As howe? SOCR. In mine opinion, when such a Cittie doth thirst too much after libertie, and lighteth on badde rulers, which giue her a dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per draught thereof then is expedient, shee is drunke therewith, and accusing the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours, as if then they were too rigorous, and Oligarchicall, doth punish them, if they bee not very gentle and permit great licentiousnesse. GLAVC. It doth so come to passe. GLAVC. And it blameth those who are obedient to the rule of Lords, as seruile people, and of no worth: But it praiseth and honoureth both publickely and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> priuately those states, wherein the lords are equall to the subiects, and the subiects to the Lords. Is it not necessarie to attaine in such a Cittie to all libertie? GLAVC. Yes doubtlesse. SOC<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Howe meane you that? SOCR. As if a father vse to make himselfe no better then his child, and to stand in awe of his sonnes, and the sonnes to make themselues as good as their father, not reuerencing or fearing their Parents, to the end they may bee free, the Hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling dooth equall himselfe to the Cittizen, the Cittizen to the Hireling: and in like <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Breefely, young men account themselues equall to olde men, and crosse them both in wordes and deedes: Olde men sitting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with those of the younger sort, tell them manie pleasaunt and facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ieastes, thereby seeking to bee like them, to the end, they may not seeme seuere and imperious. GLAVC. It is certainely so. SOCR. The libertie of the common people is extreame in such a Cittie, for the slaues that are bought, are as free as they that buy them. And I had almost forgotten <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> to note howe great an equalitie and libertie is there of women with men, and of men with women. GLAVC. May wee not say with AEschylus, that it is come vp to the mouth? SOCR. It is well saied, but I say farther, that hee who had not knowne it by experience, would neuer beleeue howe much the verie beastes that are kept in such a Cittie, bee freer then in other places. For the Bitches (as it is in the Prouerbe) are there like iolly Dames and Maistresses, and the Horses and Asses
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:7218:121"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> are wont to let on their way so freely and brauely, that they assaile him whome they meete first, whosoeuer, if hee doe not giue them the wall. To bee short, all other thinges full of libertie and licentiousnesse are there done. GLAVC. You tell mee mine owne dreame, for oftentimes as I haue walked in the fieldes, I haue beene serued so. SOC.

Finally, they contemne all Lawes, as well written, as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> vnwritten, that they may in no sort acknowledge any Lord. GLAVC. I knowe it well. SOC. This (my friend) is that braue and goodly beginning, from which the Tyrannie doth spring, as it seemeth to mee. GLAVC. A very braue beginning doubtlesse, but what followes? SOC. The same disease that was entered into the Oligarchie, and had destroyed it, budding vp, and growing here of excessiue liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, bringeth the Democratie into slauish subiection. Breefely, the too much excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the meane, is wont to cause great change in things to the contrary, in seasons, in plants, in bodies, and also in Commonweales. GLAVC. Not without good cause. SOC. For extreame libertie seemeth not to bee chaunged into ought els, saue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> slauerie, as well in priuate as publicke matters. GLAVC. It seemeth so indeed. SOC. Therefore I saied not without cause, that the Tyrannie was not made of anie other forme of gouernement, then of the Democratie, to wit, most greeuous and str<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Yet in mine opinion, this is not it that you demaunded, but what the same disease is in the Oligarchie and Democratie, which bringes them into slauish subiection. GLAVC. You say truly. SOC. I saied, that the idle and prodigall sort of people, was partlie stronger and more manly, and partly more cowardly; and that the one ledde, and the other followed, whome wee compared before to drones; the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> one to such as had stings, the other to such as had no stings. GLAVC. You did compare them so with good reason. SOC. This sort of people, in what Cittie soeuer they are, doth trouble it, as flegme and choler doth our bodies, and it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the good Phisitian and Law-giuer of a Cittie to haue as watchfull an eye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and to take as good heede as a thriftie and carefull man hath of his Bees: first, that none of these d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ones bee bredde in the Cittie, or if they bee, that they may bee presently cut off, with their beames of false credite. GLAVC. That is very requisite. SOC. Let vs take it so then, that wee may clearely see that which wee seeke for. GLAVC. In what manner? SOC. Let vs deuide the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Cittie, whose gouernement is popular, into three parts, as it is in verie deede. The one of these kindes is bredde therein, through too much libertie, euen as it is in the Oligarchicall State. GLAVC. It is so. SOC. But it is here more sharpe and rough then in the Oligarchie, for there because it hath no ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour nor aduauncement to publicke Offices, it hath also no exercise, and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by weake: But in the Democratie such kindes of people doe beare sway, some onely excepted, and the stoutest and most vnquiet among them doe publickly both speak and deale: The others goe with great cries and noise about the iudgement seates, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer none to contradict them, so that in this forme of Commonweale, almost all is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> by this kind. GLAVC. Yea certes. SOC. Then there is another kind alwayes separated from the multitude. GLAVC. What kinde is that? SOC. As all doe addict themselues to gaine, so they which are of prompter conceit, doe commonly growe richest. GLAVC. It is very likely. SOCR. From whence the drones sucke most honey and that most easily. GLAVC. Howe is it possible to sucke anie from them that haue little? SOC. Such kindes of rich men, are called the hearbe and flower, whence these drones doe drawe their stolne sweetenesse. GLAVC. It may well bee so. SOC. The third
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:7218:122"/>
kind shall be the people, that is, those which meddle onely with their owne affaires, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> trouble not themselues with other mens matters, hauing little money, and being many in number, so they are the cheefe in the Democratie, when they publickely assemble themselues. GLAVC. It is so, but they will not doe it often, vnlesse they haue a part in the honey. SOCR. Haue they not alwaies a part therein, sith the Gouernours may take away the wealth from such as haue it, and diuide it among the people, reseruing the great<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r part for themselues? GLAVC. Indeede by this meanes they haue a part. SOCR. But herevpon, they that are in this sort spoiled and depraued of their goods, bee of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie forced to resist, saying and doing all that possibly they can against the people. GLAVC. Wherefore should they not? SOCR. The others haue giuen them occasion,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> although they would not, to attempt an innouation, thereby to endammage the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and aspire to an Oligarchie. GLAVC. Yea certes. SOCR. Lastly, when they see that the people being deceaued by their Sycophants, dooth seeke to wrong them, though not of their owne accord, but through ignorance, then will they, nill they, they become altogether Oligarchicall, not willingly, I say, but because the pricking and stinging drone, doth cause this euill and mischeefe vnto them. GLAVC. It is verily so. SOCR. Then there arise amongst them accusations, iudgements, and debates. GLAVC. It is most true. SOCR. For which cause the people are wont to chuse some one for their Protectour, whome they cherish and make great. GLAC. They are indeede wont to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> doe so. SOCR. Hereby it appeareth howe Tyrans rise, and that they spring no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then from this roote. GLAVC. It is certaine. SOCR. What is then the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the chaunge of a Protectour into a Tyrant? Is it not when the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour attempteth to doe that which is saied to happen in Arcadia, neere the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Iupiter Lycian, That whosoeuer shall taste mans flesh, mingled with other oblations, doth of necessitie become a Wolfe: Haue you neuer heard of it? GLAVC. Yes marry haue I. SOCR. In like sort, this Protectour of the people finding the multitude verie obsequious, spares not his owne bloud, but doth by false accusations bring to the barre those whome hee feareth, and glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> himselfe with their vniust deaths, shortening the liues of many men, and sucking with his tongue and vnpure mouth, the blood of his neere kindred. Some hee driues out, others hee kils, and hee persuades the releasing of debts, and the diuision of landes. Wherefore, it is necessarie, that afterwards either hee bee killed by his enemies, or that hee play the Tyrant, that is, of a man, become a Wolfe. GLAVC. It followeth necessarily. SOCR. This man is seditious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the rich. GLAVC. Hee is indeede. SOCR. If hee bee expulsed, hee returnes againe maugre his enemies, and then makes himselfe a Tyran. GLAVC. Yea certes. SOCR. But his enemies, if by accusing him to the Cittizens, they cannot expulse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> him, or bring him to his end, then they secretly practise to dispatch him by violent death. GLAVC. Such is their custome. SOCR. Hereon ariseth the ordinary request and demaund of Tyrants: For all they that are mounted thither, require of the people a certaine guard for their defence, to the end (forsooth) that the peoples protectour may bee assured from daunger. GLAVC. It is very true. SOCR. Then they graunt him his request, being verie carefull of him, and assured of themselues. GLAVC. Yea certes. SOCR. The rich men seeing this, and perceauing that their wealth makes them hated of the people, then according to the Oracle giuen to Craesus, they flye towards Herma the stony, &amp; dwell no longer there, not caring if others account them feareful. GLAVC.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> For hereby they shall bee free from a second feare. SOCR. Whosoeuer then is taken in the Cittie, dies for it. GLAVC. Of necessitie. SOCR. Then sir, this braue defender of the people, doth not as yet carry himselfe with anie state or magnificence, but vailing the plumes of manie others, remaines alone in the chariot, or as it were, at the helme of the Cittie, and then, of a Protector becomes a Tyran. GLAVC. Who should hinder them?
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:7218:122"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> SOCR. Will you that I shewe the happinesse of this man, and of that Cittie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in such a person is borne? GLAVC. Shewe it I pray you. SOCR. At the beginning, for some fewe dayes, hee doth salute, vaile his bonnet, and looke cheerefully on those that hee meetes, not arrogating to himselfe as yet the title of Lord: hee promiseth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie thinges priuately and publickely, hee releaseth debts, diuideth lands, and maketh shewe of great mildnesse and assabilitie towards the people, and those that are neere his person, &amp; generally towards all. GLAVC. It is necessarie that hee doe so. SOC. Now when hee hath reconciled part of his enemies, and made away the rest, his estate being thus assured, first and cheefly hee sets abroach, and hath alwaies in hand some warre, to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the end, that the people may stand in neede of a leader. GLAVC. It is likely. SOCR. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, that by contributing of their goods, they may growe poore, and by this meanes conspire the lesse against him, sith their cheefe care and thought must bee howe to get their daily maintenance. GLAVC. It is manifest. SOCR. Farther, if hee perceaue any that are free-minded, and such as refuse to obey him, hee takes occasion by reason of the warre to set them packing on some desperate enterprise, and so makes the enemy serue for an executioner. For all these causes, it is necessary for him to bee alwaies in warre. GLAVC. Very necessary. SOCR. Whereby hee shall the more offend and incite the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens. GLAVC. Hee shal indeed. SOCR. It is not vnlikely, that some euen of those which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> haue holpen him to establish his Tyrannicall state, and are in credite with him do bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reprooue him, discoursing touching these his proceedings both with him and others; especially those that are of great courage. GLAVC. It is likely. SOCR. Hee must of necessitie dispatch all these, if hee will raigne in safetie, and neuer cease, till there remaine none either of his friendes or enemies, that is in any account. GLAVC. Yea certes. SOCR. Hee must marke then who is valiant, who mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimious, who wise, and who rich, for hee is so happie (forsooth) that hee must p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

You speake of a goodly kinde of purgation. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> SOCR. Certes, it is contrarie to those purgations that Phisitians doe prescribe: for they in purging the bodie, take away the worse, and leaue the better: but the Tyran takes away the better, and leaues the wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Hee is constrained to doe so, that hee may raigne quietly. SOCR. Then hee is bound to an happie necessitie, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forceth him either to liue with many vile and wicked men that doe hate him, or not to liue at all. GLAVC. Such is his estate. SOCR. And because that for such bad deeds hee shall be the more hated of the people, shall hee not (thinke you) haue neede of a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and more faithfull guard? GLAVC. Certes hee shall. SOCR. But what guard will bee faithful vnto him, and from whence shal he haue it? GLAVC. They will of their owne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> accords offer themselues, if hee will pay them well. SOCR. You seeme to speake of some drones that come to him from other Countreys. GLAVC. I speake the truth. SOCR. Will hee then haue none of his owne Countreymen? GLAVC. In what sort? SOCR. By remouing his slaues, then enfranchising some Cittizens, and mingling them with his Archers. GLAVC. Yes certes, so that they bee very faithfull vnto him. SOCR. You tell mee of an happie aduauntage for a Tyran, if hee vse and take such for friendes and faithfull attendaunts, when hee hath made away the rest. SOCR. Yet hee serues his turne with such. SOCR. Indeede such haue him in admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and the newe Cittizens conuerse with him, but the good doe hate and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> shunne him. GLAVC. It is verie true. SOCR. Tell mee, are not Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedies a learned kinde of Poesie, and dooth not Euripides in your iudgement ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell therein? GLAVC. For what cause? SOCR. Because hee hath sung with a deepe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, that Tyrans are wise through the company of wise men, and sayeth that they are wise with whome they conuerse, and doth moreouer extoll the Tyrannicall state, as a diuine thing, with sundry other like points that hee and the other Poets haue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <pb n="214" facs="tcp:7218:123"/>
Certes, the Tragicall Poets, as being wise men, shall pardon vs, if vs and the rest that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> doe thus ordaine and constitute any forme of gouernement, if wee receaue them not into our Commonweale, because they praise the Tyrannicall state. GLAVC. I beleeue, that the better and more elegant sort of them will pardon vs. SOCR. These fellowes go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into other Cities, &amp; drawing together troupes of people, with gay, great, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable speeches, do change wel ordered states into Tyrannies &amp; Democraties. GLAVC. Without doubt. SOCR. Haue they not (thinke you) a fee for doing so, and are they not greatly honoured as it is meete, first by the Tyrans, and then by the Democraties? But when they passe farther, and mount to the highest points of gouernement, then their honour decreaseth, as if they were not able to goe on still for want of breath. GLAVC.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> It is euen so. SOCR. But let vs returne to that matter from which wee haue digressed, and shew how the Tyran wil maintain his goodly and great armie, which consisteth alwaies of sundry sorts of men. GLAVC. It is most certain, that if there be any consecrated things in the Cittie, hee will spend and sell them while they last, exacting in the meane while so much the lesse of the people. SOCR. But when they are gone. GLAVC. Hee will then maintaine himselfe and his associates with all his traine, as well men as women with his fathers goods. SOCR. I suppose, that the people being the father and begetter of the Tyran, will mainetaine him and his. GLAVC. They must perforce. SOCR. Howe if the people growe angry with him, and say it is no reason that the sonne, when hee is great,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> should bee kept by the father, but contrariwise, the father by the sonne, and that they haue not therefore begotten and established him, to serue him when hee should bee great, and to bee subiect to his seruaunts, and that by meanes of his protection, they might bee deliuered from the rich, who beare too great a sway in the Citttie. And how if they commaund him and his traine to depart the Cittie, like a father driuing out of the dores his sonne, with his lewd companions? GLAVC. Then shall they soone knowe what hee is, and howe dangerous a beast they haue begotten, nourished, and aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and that being the weaker, they attempt to driue out the stronger. SOCR. What say you? Dares the Tyran force his father, and beat him if hee obey him not? GLAVC.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> Yea, by taking away his weapons. SOCR. Then you say hee is a Parricide, and deales hardly with his fathers age. Indeed this seemeth already a right Tyrannicall state, and as the saying is, the people flying the smoke of the subiection of free men, is fallen into the seruile flame of Tyrannie; suffering in lieu of their great and vnmeet libertie, most greeuous and straight bondage of slaues. GLAVC. This thing commeth so to passe. SOCR. But may I say that I haue sufficiently shewed in what sort the Tyrannicall state springs from the Democratie, and of what maner it is? GLAVC. Very sufficiently. SOCR. It remaineth now that we consider the Tyrannicall person, howe hee becommeth so of a Democraticall man, and what manner of person hee is, and whether he lead a misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> or happie life. GLAVC. This indeed doth yet remaine SOCR. Know you what I doe farther desire? GLAVC. What is it? SOCR. Wee haue not yet sufficiently set downe what and how many desires there are, which being not throughly declared, the search of that which wee seeke for, will bee the more obscure. GLAVC. Indeed it is very perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to our purpose, that this point be throughly opened. SOCR. Yea certes: Loe then what I desire to knowe farther herein.

GLAVC. What desires and pleasures are they? SOCR. Those that moue themselues in our sleepe, when the reasonable part of our soule, which is quiet and beareth rule therein, is at rest: and the brutish and rude part being drunken and glutted with meat, doth stirre, which breaking sleepe, seekes to enioy her accustomed pleasures.

SOCR. But when a man being of good temperature and inclination, goes to his rest, stirring vp the reasonable part which is in him, and feeding it with sound reasons &amp; spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations, begins to contemplate within himself, not hauing his repose disturbed by any concupiscence through want or abundance, nor his better part troubled with ioy or sorrow, but leauing it pure apart to contemplate and search out thinges yet vnknowne, both present, past, and to come: and hauing his passion of anger so appeased, that hee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> layes him downe, not feeling his mind moued with wrath against any man: but these two parts being moderated, hee lifts vp the third wherein wisedome doth harbour, and so betakes him to his rest: be you assured that he doth attaine to the truth, and that when he dreames, no bad visions or fancies present themselues vnto him. GLAVC. I doe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise thinke so. SOCR: I haue stood the longer on this point, that you might the better conceiue that which I purpose to declare, to wit, that there is in euery one some vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, rude, and vnlawfull kind of desires, yea euen in those who seeme to be very mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, which appeareth in sleeping.

But conuersing afterward with brauer fellowes, full of those desires whereof we lately spake, and falling into all wantonnesse, and into the humour of their manners, he hates his fathers sparing mind: yet is he of a better nature then they that do corrupt him with bad counsell, and being distracted on either side, he keeps the meane between both the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e kinds of life, vsing them both moderately, as seemeth good vnto him. Thus he liues neither like a miser, nor yet too dissolutely, becomming of an Oligarchicall, a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Democraticall person. GLAVC. Such was and yet is the opinion that is held of him. SOCR. Suppose, that sometimes this man being well in yeares, hath a sonne, whom he hath trained vp from the beginning in such manners. GLAVC. Be it so. SOCR. Suppose also that the same chaunceth to him that chanced to his father, and that he is drawne to all leudnesse &amp; licentiousnesse, which his seducing leaders call perfect libertie. Suppose also that his father and others of the house, doe further and set forward his meane de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires. Now when those vehement enchanters &amp; nourishers of Tyrannie haue no other hope left of holding this yong man, they will assay to put into his mind some humor of loue, which is the preside<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of idle affections seruing his pleasure. This is a great &amp; win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> drone, vnlesse you thinke that the loue of such things is of another nature. GLAVC. I thinke not so. SOCR. Nowe, when the other desires that rufle in his thoughts, ful of perfumes, ointments, crownes, wines, and other pleasures vsuall in such a kind of life, being already come to their highest pitch, or extremity, arme the drone with the sting of inordinate desire, then this president of the mind is beset with madnesse and enraged; and if hee feele in himselfe any stayed and frugall opinions, which yet retaine some sparke of modesty, he doth extinguish and expell them, till hee haue rooted out of his mind all temperance, and be full of new-come follies. GLAVC. You do very well declare the beginning of a Tyrannicall person. SOCR. Tell mee if Loue haue not for this cause <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> been called a Tyran. GLAVC. It seemeth yes. SOCR. And hath not the drunkard a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannicall mind? GLAVC. Yea certes. SOCR. Moreouer, the man that is furious and out of his right mind, doth he not take vpon him to command not men only, but the gods also, and hopes to compasse his desire? CLAVC. Yes doubtlesse. SOCR. Thus doth a man become altogether Tyrannicall, when as by nature, or exercise, or both togither, hee imitates the fashions of the amorous, the drunken, and the melancholicke person. GLAVC. It is altogether so. SOC<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. Such a kind of man, as it seemeth, doth in this sort
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:7218:124"/>
become so, but after what manner liues hee? GLAVC. Tell mee I pray you, as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> phrase is. SOCR. I will doe so. These men giue themselues afterward to making of feastes and banquets, to hearing of musicke, to whoredome, and all such other thinges, hauing Loue playing the Tyran within them, who gouerneth all the actions of their minde. GLAVC. It is necessary. SOCR. Wherefore many inordinate and vehement de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires spring vp day and night, which haue neede of many thinges. GLAVC. Very many. SOC. So then their lands, if they haue any, are soon conuerted into readie coyne, and that as soone spent. GLAVC. What els? SOCR. Then followes biting vsurie, and the wasting of their patrimonie. GLAVC. Yea certes. SOCR. But when all is gone, it must needs be, that many vehement desires harboured in his mind, wil cry out, and that these <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> men being pricked with the stings, as well of other desires, as of Loue (which is the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and those other passions, as it were his guard) bee enforced by necessitie to spie if any haue ought worth the taking, that they may get it from them by craft or violence. GLAVC. Yea without doubt. SOCR. They are constrained to hunt for it on all sides, or to bee vexed with extreame trouble, and discontent of mind. GLAVC. It is necessarie. SOCR. Now when the new-bred pleasures haue surmounted the old, and vsurped their place and power: such a kinde of person will then deeme it meete and iust, that hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing younger, should haue more then his Parents haue, and when hee hath wasted his owne portion of substance, hee will spend theirs also. GLAVC. Yea certes. SOCR. But <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> if his Parents will not suffer him, then will he robbe and deceaue them. GLAVC. Out of question. SOCR. If he cannot compasse this, then he will spoile them by force. GLAVC. I beleeue it. And if they resist his outrage, thinke you hee will feare them, and therefore abstaine from any Tyranical action? GLAVC. I am not therof assured. SOCR. Tell me Adimantus, I heartily pray you, if you thinke that he will abandon and forsake his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, being his auncient and necessary friend, for a new-affected and vnnecessary dame; or that hee will cast off his old father, being nowe deformed, yet a necessary friend vnto him, and the auncientest that he hath for the vnnecessary affection hee beareth to some fine boy, whom he lately fancied? Or doe you not rather thinke that hee will beate both <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> father aud mother, and make them subiect to these other, if he bring them into the same house? ADIM. By Iupiter he will doe so. SOC. Loe what good hap it is to haue begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a Tyrannicall sonne ADIM. Not very great good hap. SOCR. But to proceed, when his Parents wealth is likewise wasted, and there is still a thicke swarme of inordinate pleasures, first he will breake the wall of some house, or snatch away some mans garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that walkes late in the night, then perhaps hee will robbe a church: and in all these acts the opinions lately freed from subiection, enuironning the passion of loue as a guard, will ouermatch those which he had since his infancy, touching honestie and filthinesse, as certain bounds to discern them: which opinions were before at liberty in his dreams <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> only, while he was as yet popularly trained vp under the laws and precepts of his father, but being brought by loue into this Tyrannicall humour, he will become the same, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being awake, as he was seldome before when he slept; he will not refrain from murther, gluttonie, nor whatsoeuer vicious actions: for Loue, which doth Tyrannically liue and raigne in him with all licentiousnesse, as a Monarch will drawe him being thus subiect, (euen as in like case a whole Citie) into all desperate boldnesse, whereby he will nourish himselfe and the whole troupe of his attendaunts, which are come partly outwardly of euill custome, and partly inwardly of the same manners, being now loosed and enfran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chised by him. Is not this the order of such a mans life? ADIM. It is. SOC. But if there <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> be in the Citty fewe such as they, and the rest of the people moderate, then will they packe thence to serue in the guard of some other Tyran, and being waged by him, will aid him in his warres, if h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When there are many such in a Citty, and they backed and followed by others, then will they knowing their owne strength and number, make him their Tyran (abusing so the peoples ignorance) which hath the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test &amp; stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gest Tyrannies in his mind. ADIM. This is very likely, because he wil best play the Tyran. SOCR. Shall it not be an easie matter, when all giue place? But if the Cittie stand against him, then as he did before outrage his father and mother, so will he serue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> his Countrey now, bringing in other young gallants of the same humour, to whom he will enthrall both <hi>Patria</hi> and <hi>Matria,</hi> as the Cretanes call it. And this is the end of such a mans desire. ADIM. Altogether. SOCR. Are they not likewise so addicted in priuate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their aduancement?

And herewithall the vniustest me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that may be, if we haue well determined in the former discourses what iustice is. ADIM. We haue well determined it. SOCR.

It is necessary (quoth Glaucon) beginning againe to speake. SOCR. Now, whomsoeuer wee see very wicked, wee shall also see him <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> very miserable, and he is doubtlesse the longer both wicked and wretched, that doth the longer, and with greater violence tyrannize: but all men are not of the same opinion. GLAVC. This must needs be so. SOCR. The man that is tyrannically minded, resembles the Cittie, whose Lord is a Tyran: and he whose humour is Democratical, in like sort re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembleth the Popular state, and so wee may say of the rest. GLAVC. What els? SOCR. Then as one Cittie is in respect of another, touching vertue and happinesse, so is also one man in respect of another. GLAVC. He is so. SOCR. Tell mee then what is the state of a Cittie oppressed by a Tyran, in respect of that which is ruled by a King? Is it such as we haue described that to be? GLAVC. Cleane contrary, for the one is very good, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the other very badde. SOCR. I will not aske which of them you meane. GLAVC. It is of it selfe manifest inough. SOCR. But doe you iudge according to the same maner of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse and misery, or according to some other? We must not be astonished at the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sight of a Tyran, &amp; some few about him, but it were requisit to enter &amp; passe through all the City, and hauing wel considered euery thing, then to deliuer our opinion therof. GLAVC. Your counsel is good. And certes no City is more vnhappy than that which is in bondage to a Tyran, and none more happie then the Cittie gouerned by a King. SOCR. Say I were of aduise, that wee ought to obserue like order in the discouering of mans humours, should I doe amisse, requiring that he might iudge of them, who could <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> with his thoughts pierce into the mind of a Tyran, and fully perceiue his conditions, not being astonished as a child, when he viewes the pompe that tyrans shew a farre off to the beholders, but could sufficiently discerne. Say I were of opinion, that wee ought all to heare this man, who could iudge thereof, as hauing long dwelt with a tyran, and assisted him in his priuate actions, knowing howe he demeanes himselfe towards all his familiars, and what the place is wherein he may be seene disrobed of all his tragical fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture, and subiect to publicke dangers: if it were my desire, that he who had seene all

Well then consider thus, recalling to your memory the likenesse of the Citie and of the man of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we lately spake, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> noting diligently and each after other, the passions of both? GLAVC. What passions? SOCR. Tel me first, wil you cal the state of that city free or ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile, whose Lord is a Tyran? GLAVC. The most seruile state that possibly may be. SOCR. You see many lords &amp; free men there. GLAVC. I see many there, but few free men: for the whole &amp; the better part doth endure ignominious &amp; vnhappy bondage. SOCR. Then if <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> that resemblance between the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; the citie do hold stil, there must be the like order in both, &amp; his mind ful of slauery &amp; basenesse, the better part seruing the lesse the worse &amp; more furious, which beareth rule therein. GLAVC. It is necessarie. SOCR. But will you call the state of such a minde seruile or free? GLAVC. Seruile. SOCR. Can the Cittie which is in bondage to a Tyran, doe what it listeth? GLAVC. In no wise. SOCR. No more can the mind enthralled to Tyrannicall passions, doe what it will, if wee speake of the whole mind, but alwaies being pricked with some violent sting, it will be ful of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and repentance. GLAVC. What els? SOCR. Is it necessarie that such a Citie be rich or poore? GLAVC. Poore. SOCR. It is therefore necessarie that the Tyrannicall minde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> be alwaies needie and insatiable. GLAVC. It is so. SOCR. Shall not such a man be euer in feare? GLAVC In verie great feare. SOCR. Thinke you to find in anie other citie, more lamentations, sighes, weepings, and sorrowes? GLAVC. No certes. SOCR. Neither shal you finde such miseries in anie other man, as you shall in him which is Tyrannicall, whose mind is enraged with inordinate desires, and cheefly loue. GLAVC. It is true. SOCR. Then for these and other like respects you haue iudged that the most miserable Cittie of all, which is in bondage to a Tyran. GLAVC. Haue I not reason to iudge so? SOCR. Doubtlesse you haue. But what say you of the Tyrannicall man, when you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the same things. GLAVC. I say he is the most miserable of all other men. SOCR.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> But therein you say not well. GLAVC. For what cause? SOCR. This man is not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether so as yet. GLAVC. Who then? SOCR. He whom you may truly iudge to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed him in misery. GLAVC. And who I pray, or what kind of man is that? SOCR. It is he, who being by nature Tyrannicall, doth not lead a priuate life, but is so vnhappy, that by some ill fortune hee becommeth a Tyran. GLAVC. I coniecture by the former dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses, that you speake the truth. SOCR. Certes, neuerthelesse you must not barely suppose these things, but diligently consider them by such reason; for the consideration is of no small importance, to know which is the good or bad state of life. GLAVC. You say well. SOCR. Then I pray you marke my words, for me thinkes wee must consider of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> him by these. GLAVC. By whom? SOCR. By those priuate men in Citties, who are rich, and haue many slaues, for they doe thus farre resembled Tyrans, in that they beare rule ouer many. But there is a difference in this, that the Tyran commands a greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. GLAVC. That is the difference indeed. SOCR. You know that these liue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>afely there with their families, and feare not their seruants. GLAVC. What should they fear? SOCR. Nothing, but knowe you the cause thereof? GLAVC. Yea, it is because the whole Cittie will in this behalfe, aide euery particular Cittizen. SOCR. You say right: but if some disaster hap drawe anie of them out of the Cittie, hauing with him some fifty slaues or more, with his wife and children, and set him with the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> rest of his goods and seruants in some desert place where no free man is at hand to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour him, in how great feare thinke you he would be, as well for himselfe, as for his wife and children, least they should be murthered by the slaues? GLAVC. Hee would doub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> lesse be in great feare. SOCR. Should he not then be constrained to flatter some of them and set them at libertie, becomming by these meanes a flatterer of his owne seruaunts? GLAVC. He must perforce doe so, or die. SOCR. But how if hee were enuironned with
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:7218:125"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> such neighbours as would not suffer one to raigne thus ouer another, and meeting such a man, would put him to death? GLAVC. His estate were worse, then if hee were round beset with enemies. SOCR. Is not the Tyran shut vp in a like prison, being of such a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as we haue declared, full of many and diuers terrors, and lewd fancies? And though he haue a verie couetous humour, yet dares not he alone in all the Cittie, goe forth any way, nor view the things which freemen may, but remaines most commonly mewed vp in his chamber like a woman, repining at the other Citizens, if anie of them go abroad and view ought worth the seeing. GLAVC. It is so. SOCR. This man being of euill go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment in himselfe, whom you lately called very miserable, falleth from such euils to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> other farre worse, if he lead not a priuate life, but be enforced by some fortune to play the Tyran, and being vnable to commaund himselfe, vndertaketh to commaund others, as if a man, whose bodie were sickelie, &amp; not able to bear it selfe, could not liue in quiet, but must needes spend his life in continuall quarrelling and fighting with other bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. GLAVC. You speake verie likely and verie true things. SOCR. Tell mee then friend Glaucon is not the estate of a Tyran altogether miserable, and worse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the life which you did before deeme verie bad? GLAVC. Yes certes. SOCR. For which cause a Tyran (though he seeme not so to all men) is subiect to grosse flatteries and seruilenesse, a great fauorour of many wicked men, and one that neuer saciates his desires, but wants many <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> things, and is in verie deed poore, if wee consider his whole mind, vexed with feare du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all his life, and full of cares and discontents: therein resembling the Cittie wherof he is Lord. Doth hee resemble it or not? GLAVC. Verie much. SOCR. Wee will farther attribute vnto him the qualities before recited, that it is necessary for him at the first, but more after he hath gotten authoritie, to be enuious, disloial, vniust, without amitie, irreligious, a fauourer and maintainer of all euill, and by reason of these vices verie mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable, and that he makes al the rest of his adherents, as bad as himself.

For if it were wel said in the Ethickes, that the happie life is according to vertue, not empeached, and that vertue is Mediocritie; then it must bee, that the meane is the best of that Mediocritie, which most men attaine.

Wherefore the City consisteth of slaues and lords, not of free men:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> and of these the one part is enuious, and the other disdaineful, which things are much repugnant to amitie &amp; ciuile conuersation, that proceedeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> societie &amp; good will: For we will not so much as walk with our enemies. A citie therfore must be principally of men, whose estates are equal &amp; alike, as are they whose substance is meane. For which cause it is necessarie, that that City be well gouerned, which consisteth of those things whereof we say the naturall constitution of a Citie is, and that those Citizens enioy more safety then any other, for they desire not other mens goods, as the poore doe, neither are their goods desired by others, as the poor do co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus we see that of all ciuile societies, that is the best which consisteth of men whose estate is meane; and that those Cities are well gouerned, wherein there are many such inhabitants, which may haue more power then the other two parts, or at the least then either of them alone. For being adioined, they cause the city to encline; and preuent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary excesses. It is then great good hap, that they who gouerne the Commonweale, haue meane and sufficient substance: For where the one are too rich, and the others haue nothing, there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth an extreame Democratie, or an intollerable Oligarchie, or a Tyrannie, through both excesses: for of too hautie a Democratie and an Oligarchie, is made a Tyrannie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> which thing chaunceth farre more seldome amongst men of meane and equall estate: the cause <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> whereof wee will shewe afterwards in discoursing of the changes of Commonweales. Then the meane forme of gouernment is the best, because that onely is without sedition: for where there is great Mediocritie, there arise no seditions nor diuisions of Commonweales: and for this reason great Cities are lesse seditious, because they haue many inhabitants of meane estate. As for smal Cities, they may easily be deuided into two parts, so that there is no meane: for almost althere, are poore or rich. Likewise, the Democraties are surer, and of longer continuance then Oligarchies, by reason of the inhabitants of meane estate which are there in greater number, and haue more part in the honours of the Commonweale, then in Oligarchies: for when the poore doe without them grow to great power and multitude, the state of the City becommeth miserable, &amp; is forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> ruinated. That this is so, there is a manifest signe, viz. that the best Law-giuers haue beene meane Citizens, for so was Solon, as it appeareth by his verses; and Lyc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, and almost all the rest. We may hereby knowe the cause why the greater part of Commonweales are Democraticall or Oligarchicall: For by reason that oft times there is small Mediocritie in them, whensoeuer the one or the other exceed, viz. the rich men, or the people, and transgresse the meane, they drawe the Commonweale vnto them, whereon followes a Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratie or an Oligarchie. Moreouer, when there happen seditions and fightings betweene the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and the rich men, they which preuaile, do not establish the Commonweale in common, or equal sort, but esteeme it the guerdon of their victorie to excel or bear most sway in the Commonweale:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> and so the one make a Democratie, the other an Oligarchie. Besides, they who haue obtained the principality of Greece, each regarding the forme of their owne Commonweales, haue established in Cities, some of them Democraties, others. Oligarchies, not considering the profite of those cities but their own priuat commodity. For these causes there is neuer or seldome, and amongst few me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, a meane Commonweale: for of all the Princes of former times one onely would haue established such a manner of Commonweale. But the custome of reiecting equalitie, and seeking to bear sway,

Hereby it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth which is the best Commonweale, and for what cause. As for the other Commonweales, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as we say that there are many Democraties, and many Oligarchies, the perfect Commonweal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing set downe, it shall be no hard matter to know which is to be accounted the first, which the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and so of the rest; because one is worse, and another better: For that is of necessitie the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which is neerest, and that the worst which is farthest from the mean: vnlesse we iudge by sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, I meane by supposition, because oft times though one forme of Commonweale be more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to mens desires, yet there is no let to the contrary<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore, that is the best Cittie which consisteth of such, and being as it were exempted from seditions, doth thereby long vphold it selfe, but where many are exceedingly rich and poor, there <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> doth easily growe an intollerable Oligarchie or Tyrannie, if the rich preuaile; or an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame Democratie, if the multitude of poore men get the vpper hand.

                  <hi>WE will speake againe of all Commonweales in general, and of euery one seuerally in the discourse following, beginning where it is requisit. Then there are three parts in all Commonweales, wherein an aduised Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuer must diligently consider and regard what is fit or behoofefull for euery one. For where such parts are duly ordained, the Commonweales doe of necessitie prosper wel, and differ only according to the difference which is in euery one of them. One of these three parts consisteth in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke Counsell: the second in the Magistrates, what power they haue, &amp; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> how they ought to be created: The third in the Iudges. It belonging to the Counsell to haue the directing and ordering of the affaires both of peace and warre, to make leagues, or to breake the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to ordaine Lawes, and to abrogate them, to condemne, to banish, to confiscate, and to call the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates to account. The consultations of all such matters ought to be committed to all the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, or all the same to certaine, as to some Magistrate, or to many; or diuers of the same con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultations to some, or some to all, or certaine of them to certaine: when all doe consult, and of all thinges, that is Popular, for the people seeke for such equalitie. All the Citizens may consult many waies, as one way by turnes, and not altogether; as in the Commonweale of Tele<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Another way is, when all the citizens doe consult to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, assembling onely about the creation of Magistrates, and the stablishing of lawes, &amp; when there is any question about matters of peace, or of warre, or of the calling of the Magistrates to account. The other matters doe remaine in the deliberation of the Magistrates, being euery one appointed to his charge, and created out of all the Citizens, and either by election or by lots. Another way is, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the citizens do assemble together about the creation of Magistrats, &amp; calling <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to account: &amp; when deliberation is to be had of the wars, or of the making of any martial asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation: the other affaires being administred by the Magistrates which are elegible, as those are, which ought of necessity to be exercised by men of skill. The fourth way is, when all the citizens asse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="225" facs="tcp:7218:128"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> which we haue affirmed to be correspondent to that Oligarchie which is called a Dinastie, or Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentatie, and to the Tyrans Monarchie: All these wayes are Popular. But where a certaine number doe consult of all affaires, it is an Oligarchie, wherein there bee also many differencies. For when they bee created in respect of small substance, and are the greater number, by meanes of the meanenesse of their goods, and enterprise not against the Lawe, but obey it: And when it is lawfull for whosoeuer hath that proportion of goods limitted by the Lawe, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to the Gouernement; that kind of gouernement is an Oligarchie: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>owbeit ciuile and tollerable in respect of the Mediocritie that raigneth in it. But where all Citizens are not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to deliberate, but those onely that are elected doe gouerne according to lawe, as afore, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that pertaines to the Oligarchie. Also when those that haue authoritie to deliberate, doe chuse themselues, and the sonne succeedeth in the roome of his father, and are Maisters of the Lawes; of necessity this order is Oligarchicall. When the offices are deuided, as for example, if the deliberating of peace and warres; and the calling of Magistrates to account, bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to all the Citizens, and the other affaires to those Magistrates that are created by ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or by lots, it is an Aristocratie, or a Commonweale. If Magistrates bee chosen by voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for any speciall cause, and created by lots for other causes, either absolutely out of all them that afore haue beene elected, or are taken by election and by lot, it is partly an Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratie, and partly a Commonweale. Thus the Counsell is deuided, according to the nature of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Commonweales; and euery Commonweale is administred according to such determination and meanes as wee haue here set downe. But it is behoofefull for that kinde of Democratie; which at this day seemeth to bee cheefly a Democratie, to wit, where the people is maister of the Lawes, for better and more fit order in consultations, to doe in assemblies as is practised in Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garchies, where they set fines vpon their heads that will not bee Iudges, to the end, that by this meane they may bee constrained to iudge. But in Democraties, they appoint a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>e to the needie, the which should seeme a good course in the assemblies, wherein all should determine better in common, to wit, the common people with the Nobilitie, and the Nobilitie with the multitude. Moreouer, it auaileth, that the consulters bee taken by election, or by lot, equally out of all parts <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of the citie. Also, it is behoofefull that the vulgar people should be more in number then the men apt to gouerne, or not to giue fees to all, but to so manie as shall bee correspond<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>t to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Noblemen, or to exclude the greatest part of them by lots. As touching the Oligarchies, it is behoofefull for them either to chuse certaine of the multitude, or to ordaine such Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates as are in some Commonweales, whom they call forecounsellours, or foreseers, or keepers of the lawes, and then to consult of those matters whereabout they had before deliberated. So shall the people be present and assistant at the consultations, and will not enterprise to alter any thing in the Commonweale: &amp; wil decree the very selfesame things, or nothing contrary to that which shal be referred vnto them. Or els that all the Citizens should be receiued to the counsell, howbeit <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> in such sort, as that the Magistrates onely shall haue authority to consult. And it is expedient to doe quite contrary to that which is practised in Commonweales, that the authority and sentence of the people may take place in absoluing &amp; discharging, and not in condemning, but rather that their sentences of condemnation be referred to the Magistrates. For the contrary is practised in those Commonweales where the authority and sentence of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

From this Counsell proceedeth the directing and ordering of matters of Religion, of Iustice, of Armes, of Treasure, of Lawes, of Magistrates, and of Manners. Plato in the twelfth booke of his Lawes, calleth it the Anker of the whole Cittie, whereby it is set sure, and staied as the shippe is in the water. Moreouer, in the same booke hee sayth, That this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell hath such place in the Cittie, as the soule and the head haue in liuing creatures: for the vnderstanding is infused into the soule; and in the head, the sight and hearing are placed, insomuch, that the mind being ioined to two goodly sences, and reduced into <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> one, doth preserue euerything. This Counsell therefore whereof wee speake, is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersly ordained, according to the diuersitie of gouernements. In Fraunce, first of all the King hath all power and authority in all causes touching peace and warre, hee calleth together and holdeth the Estates of the Kingdome, according to the auncient obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation and custome of the same, whensoeuer he seeth any need requireth: hee proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth for all offices and benefices that are electiue, and for Captaineships: he disposeth of the monies, and employeth them where the publicke affaires doe require it: he alone maketh Lawes himselfe, and expoundeth them: sendeth Embassadours into straunge Countries to be there ordinarily resident, or to discusse some controuersie, to treat of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> peace or truce, to shew his right and claime, and to summon any Citty or Countrey to yeeld vnto him, whereof hee deliuereth instructions signed with his owne hand, and the hand of one of his Secretaries of Estate: to mone for the death of a Prince, and to congratulate the new comming of another to the kingdome, as is accustomed amongst friends: He ordaineth that which is necessary to be done to strange Embassadours, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth them from his owne mouth, and giueth them their dispatch. Besides this, as euery state is maintained by rewarding of well doing, and punishing of euill, the one being fauourable, the other odious: he himselfe distributeth the Honours, graunteth the recompences, and punisheth by Iustice, which is a great aduantage and furtherance <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> vnto him to be loued, obeyed, and honoured. The first Counsell about the King, is the secret Counsell, which is called the counsell of affaires, and is commonly holden in the morning after his vprising, whereto he calleth a certaine small number of those whom he accounteth the wisest, and of greatest experience, and most faithfull vnto him, with whom hee secretly communicateth his principall affaires, as they happen and fall out. There the letters which come from Embassadours, from Gouernours and Captains of the Frontiers, are red, dispatches are resolued vpon, and comm<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>anded to the Secretaries being there present, euery one according to his Office: gifts and benefites are there agreed vpon; and the rols of the same, and all the principall matters there determined,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> are signed by the kings hand. The number is greater in the priuy Counsell, whereinto men are called in respect of the Nobilitie of their blood, and by the highnesse of their house, or dignity, Wisedome, Knowledge, and Experience. The King himselfe is present therein now and then when any great matter is deba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Sometimes also the parties themselues haue audience, or speake by aduo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates. This Counsell being ordained for the complaints of priuate men in such affaires as concerne the state, and for the reports of Citties and Prouinces, doth iudge the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peales of Parliaments, lookes to the Mercurials touching their order &amp; discipline how it is kept, aduiseth on the treaties of graine and wines, &amp; on the Marchandises brought into the Realme, or carried out, and the imposts set therin: It taketh order for the course and value of money, and hath care of the demeins of the Crowne, of taxes, subsidies, and other reuenues of the king: and of the principall farmes, in prolonging the time, it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> makes abatements to farmers, or dischargeth them with knowledge of the cause and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations going before, ioyned to the aduise of the Treasurers and Generals of the charges. Furthermore, whatsoeuer is agreed on and ordained to take effect, must be sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by one Secretarie at the least, and sometimes by one Secretarie and Maister of the Requests, or by some person that is qualified, according to the nature of the cause, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be sealed by the Chauncellour, who is a seuere examiner, and as it were, a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouler of all things, which maketh his Office very great, and sometimes hatefull. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, all publicke treaties, edicts and ordinances must be certified in soueraigne courts, and all the kings rescripts allowed by the Iudges, to whom they are directed. In Turkie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the Grand Signior doth neuer or very seldome giue audience to any priuate man, but onely admitteth into his presence the Embassadors of strange Princes sent to him with presents, and after hee hath giuen them his hand to kisse, and vnderstood the cause of their comming, not dealing farther with them, hee referreth them to his Bassas, which hold a Counsell called Diuan, wherein is open audience foure daies in the weeke, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday, Sunday, Munday, Tuesday, in that place where the Prince doth soiourne; if in time of peace, at Constantinople, or some other Citty in his Serrail; if in warre, in his pauilion.

Being assembled in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> they consult touching the affaires of the said Embassadors, and the answeres which must be giuen them, touching matters of estate and soueraignty, touching meanes to be prouided for the strengthening of Prouinces which begin to decay, touching mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and condemnations.

At Rome, while the Commonweale lasted, the Consuls being present, had the gouernement of all publike affaires, with as great authoritie almost as Kings, whom all the other Magistrates obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Tribunes of the people excepted, who were opposed against them, to the end, to bridle their authoritie, and controule their doings. They assembled the elections to create their Consuls, or Pretours, or Censors, and to establish newe Lawes: they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> tooke order for warlike preparations, and all matters for the campe. In gouerning their Prouinces, they commaunded ouer their confederates as seemed good vnto them: they made Captaines of thousands, leauied Souldiors, and chose the fittest: they might punish all their subiects wheresoeuer they dwelt, and employ the publicke treasure as they would, being for this purpose followed by the Questor, who forthwith obeyed their commandement. The Senate disposed the reuenue of the Empire &amp; the common charges; it was not lawfull for the Questors to bestow one penny without their order, vnlesse it were for the Consuls: to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> belonged the punishing of all offences through Italie, which merited open punishment, as treason, conspiracie, poysoning, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> &amp;c. If any priuate person, or any Cittie had neede of fauours, or reproofe, or of aid and defence, the Senate had the whole charge thereof. If Embassadours were to bee sent to any Prince or State out of Italie to reconcile, or intimate, to commaund ought, to possesse, or to denounce warre, the Senate tooke order for it. If any strange Embassadours came to Rome, it belonged to the Senate likewise to take order for their entertainement, and for the answeres that should bee made them. The people alone had the authority of rewarding and punishment, wherein consisteth all gouernement, and the whole life of man: they alone condemned to death, bestowed Magistracies, honours, and publicke charges, and ratified the Lawes: Peace and Warre was at their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> choice and appointment: they determined of sending succour, of vnion and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with their allies, they confirmed and approued these things, or disanulled them.

In Switzerland euery Canton hath a double Counsell, the little and the great. But vpon any weigthy cause that concerneth all the Cantons, they hold their generall Counsell called a Iourney or Diet, the most times at Baden: as in like case the Ionians and AEtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans did in ancient times, calling such assemblies <gap reason="foreign">

There was besides in Greece a publicke counsell of all the States, called the Amphictionicall counsell, because it was first ordained and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> by Amphiction the sonne of Deucalion: Plinie in his 35. booke, calleth it <hi>Publicum Graeciae Concilium.</hi> Those people that from the beginning sent thether their Agents called Pylagorae, and had voices therein, where the Ionians, Dorians, Perhae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beans, Beotians, Magnesians, Achaians, Pthiotes, Melians, Dolopians, AEnians, Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phians, and Phocians: afterward there came many others also. Strabo in his ninth book of Cosmographie writeth, That this Counsell was kept at Delphos in the Temple of Apollo, by reason of the commodious scituation of the place, which is as it were in the middest of Greece, as well of that part within Isthmus, as that without: and he calleth it <gap reason="foreign">

This Counsell of the Amphictions was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> held twice a yeare, in the Spring, and in Autumne: That the authority thereof was great, it appeareth by Diodorus Siculus in his sixteenth booke <hi>De Bibliotheca Historica, cap.</hi> 8. where he saith, that the Thebans not contented with the battel of Leuctra, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they had ouerthrowne the Lacedemonians, did besides frame a complaint against them in the assembly of the States of Greece, which is called the Counsell of the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phictions, and did prosecute it in such sort, that the Lacedemonians were there co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in a great summe of money, because they had taken by stealth in time of peace the Castle of Thebes, which was called Cadmaea. In like manner the Phocians also ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing prophaned and tilled a great part of the ground consecrated to the gods, called <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Cyrrhaea, were therefore condemned also by the Amphictions in a great summe of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, which because they refused to pay, the said counsell of the Amphictions declared, If the Phocians did not pay the fine wherein they were condemned for offence to the gods, that then their countrey should bee confiscate and consecrated to the gods. And they farther decreed, at what times all the others which had beene condemned, should be enforced likewise to pay their fines, of which number the Lacedemonians were, and if any of them refused to obey the decrees of the Counsell, that they should be reputed excommunicate, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Furthermore, that all they who had in anie sort beene accessary to this sacriledge, or which had fled out of the Countrey, should bee held for excommunicated persons, and that it should bee lawfull to lay hands on them, and lead them away wheresoeuer they might be found: that all the good townes of the Countrey of Phocis should be pulled downe, and made small villages, so as none of them might containe more then fifty houses, yet that the lands should bee left vnto them, paying yearely sixtie Talents, which amount to six and thirtie thousand Crowns,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> for tribute to Apollo, vntill they had fully repaied all the gold and siluer that they had taken out of the Temple of Apollo. That Philip and his successours should fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth haue the gouernment and iurisdiction of the Pythian games, together with the Boeotians and Thessalians, because the Corinthians had beene accessary to the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge committed by the Phocians against the gods: That the Amphictions, and King Philip should burne and breake to peeces the armours of the Phocians and of the strangers which had beene waged by them, and that afterwards they should burne the remainder of them, and that their horses should bee sold. The Amphictions did like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise make a decree for the defence of the Oracle, and for all other things concerning <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> religion and reuerence towards the gods, as also for peace and vnion betweene the Greekes. Budeus is of opinion, that the summoning and generall assembly of the three Estates of Fraunce may bee called by a Greeke name <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. The auncient Kings of Fraunce were woont to hold E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states very often, which was an assembly of all their subiects, or of some deputed for them. And the holding of Estates is nothing els then when the King acquainteth his subiects with his greatest affaires, and taketh their aduise and counsell: likewise hee hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth their complaints and greeuances, and giueth order touching them, as reason re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth. This was aunciently called the holding of a Parliament, which name it hath <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> yet retained in England and Scotland. But because that by this meanes the Kings had knowledge, as well of generall complaints which concerne the whole Estate, as of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate, which concerne particular causes: the name of Parliament hath remained in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate, and touching particulars, which are held by a certaine number of Iudges appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the King, which are called a Parliament. The publicke and generall audiences which the King hath reserued to himselfe, haue taken the name of Estates. The Estates were assembled for diuerse causes, and according to the occurences and occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, either to demand aide of men and money, or to take order for ciuile causes &amp; mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of warre, or for the portions or allowances of the kings yonger sonnes, as it chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> in the time of Lewis the eleuenth, or to determine touching the gouernement of the realme, or other causes. In which assemblies the Kings did sit, and were President, saue onely ouer the Estates, wherein was handled the noblest cause that euer was, to wit, to whom the Kingdome of Fraunce should belong, after the deceasse of Charles the faire, whether to Philip de Valoys his cousin, or to Edward King of England his brother in Lawe. Philip was not President there, for hee was not as then king, and besides, was a partie therein. It is doubtlesse, that the people receaue great furtherance by the saied Estates, for they haue thereby the good hap to come neere the person of their King, to make their complaints vnto him, present <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> their petitions, and receaue the necessary remedies and redresses. <hi>Messire Michel de l' Hospitall</hi> Chauncellour of Fraunce, in the first Oration hee made to the Estates held at Orleance, <hi>Anno,</hi> 1559. Wherein hee doth at large confute those which say that the king doth in some sort diminish his soueraigne power, by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king aduise and counsell of his subiects, sith hee is not bound thereunto, and that hee maketh himselfe too familiar with them, which engendereth a contempt and

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> abasing of the kingly dignity. Touching the Parliament of England, Polydor Virgil doth thus write thereof in the life and acts of king Henry the third: The kings of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland (sayeth hee) were not woont to assemble their subiects for to consult with them touching the affaires of the Realme, or if they did, it was verie sildome; so that we may by good right ascribe the order and manner thereof to this king Henry, which hath taken such roote, that since his time no matter of importance hath euer beene done, concerning the Gouernement of the kingdome and safetie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, vnlesse it hath beene first referred to this Counsell: and whatsoeuer things are decreed and done by the commaundement of the king and people, vnlesse they bee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> ratified by the authoritie of this Counsell, they are accounted of no force. But least there should any impeachment go through the iudgement of the ignorant multitude, such of the Cleargie and people as shal be present and assistant there, haue by a certaine lawe beene noted and declared from the beginning. It is called a Parliament af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of Fraunce, and euerie king dooth vsually call or summon it at his comming to the Crowne, to chaunge or abrogate old Lawes, and to make newe if neede require, by the aduise of the Counsell, after which time hee may so oft as hee will call the saied Court of Parliament, according to the exigence of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent occasions: the manner which they obserue in consultation, is this, The <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Counsell being assembled for the good of the Prince and people, to the end that euery one there assistant, may freely speake in his degree and turne, they are separated the one from the other, for the Ki<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Prelates on their part obserue like order: and when their speaker hath aduertised them of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test number of opinions, the Archbishop there present giues assent thereto, and ioines with the rest in the establishing of Lawes. The proper Lawe of England dependeth on the decrees of the Prince and people, approoued and ratified by the authoritie of this high Court; and they call it the cheefest Lawe of all: neither dooth that Countrey receaue or admit any other ciuile Lawe. In Almaigne, the Emperour can decree no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing touching the weale publicke of Germany, or the authority, or safetie of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Empire, without the aduise and consent of all the Estates, especially the seuen Electors; neither can hee alone at his owne pleasure vndertake warre, impose taxes, leuie Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours of the same Countrey, or ent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Iulius Pflug in his treatise of the Commonweale of Germany, complaineth, That the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours authority is much abased, and that euery one of the Electours hath more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> power in his owne Prouince, then the Emperour hath throughout all Germanie: For besides other prerogatiues, it is lawfull for the Electo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It must likewise bee consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered whether the Magistracies ought to be perpetual, or of long continuance, or neither, but that the same persons may often execute them: or whether it bee better that one man doe not beare office twice, but once onely. Moreouer, touching the ordinance of Magistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, it must be considered out of what estate or quality of men, and by whom, and in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they ought to be created. For it must be knowne in how many sorts these things may be done, and for what Commonweales what kinds of Magistrates are fit. Neither is it an easie thing to determine which may properly bee called Magistracies, sith ciuile society hath need of many Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidents or Gouernours. Wherefore it is not meete to call all those Magistrates who are created by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> election, or taken by lot, as first the Priests, whose function differs from the charge of ciuile Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, then the ouerseers and orderers of publicke feastes, the Heralds and Embassadour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now euery thing is better done, when men attend and follow one thing only, then when they are distracted with the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> charge of many things: but in smal cities necessity inforceth to bestow many offices on few persons, for by reason of the smal quantity of inhabitants many cannot haue charge, for who should after succeed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? sometimes also smal cities haue need of the same kinds of Magistracies, and the same lawes that the great cities haue, but the difference is this, that the one haue often need of the same, &amp; the other after long time. Wherfore nothing hinders, but that many offices may be committed together to one man, because they doe not hinder each other, it being necessary by reason of the smal number of citizens to create Magistrates, as instruments seruing to diuerse vses. Then if we can declare how many Magistrates are necessary for euery city, and how many not necessary, yet meet; this point being explaned, we may easily know what Magistracies may be conueniently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> in one. It will likewise be expedient not to be ignorant to what kinds of Magistrates, many offices may be committed by the lawes, &amp; of what offices a Magistrate may euery where haue the executing and authority: as the discipline of modesty, if in the market place it pertaineth to the AEdile, &amp; in another place to some other officer, or euery where to the same: as also whether the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction is to be made in respect of the affairs, or of the persons; I mean, as if one had charge of the discipline of modesty, to know whether such a charge ought to be committed to one man ouer chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, &amp; to another ouer women. Likewise in Commonweales to know whether the kinds of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracies do differ in e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Neuerthelesse, there are some offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces proper, as is theirs who are called Preconsulters, which is no popular office, although the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel be popular: for there must be certain persons to consult &amp; deliberate before the people, least they should hinder their priuat busines, which Preconsulters if they be few in nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, it is Oligarchical. Now it is necessary that they be few, therfore their office is Oligarchical. But where both these of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices are, the Preconsulters are ordained against the publicke counsellors: for to consult is popular, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> &amp; to preconsult Oligarchichal: but the authority of cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sel is lost in Democraties, where the people assembling, doth determine of al things; as it vsually commeth to passe, where there is great profit or fees appointed for those that are assistant in assemblies: for being idle, they do oft assemble, and meddle in al matters the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues. As for the ouerseer of women &amp; children, or if there be any other officer hauing such charge, it is Aristocratical, not Democratical. For how should they bar poore mens wiues from going out of their houses? Neither is this Oligarchical, sith the wiues of Oligar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical persons liue deliciously. But we haue for this time spoken ynough of these things. Let vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the ordaining of Magistracies, &amp; finish that discourse. The differences co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sist in three points which comprise al the other sorts<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the first, who they are that create Magistrats; the second, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> out of what estate of men; the third, in what manner. Each of these three hath three differences: for either the Magistrates are created by all the citizens, or by some of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or out of all, or out of some certain &amp; appointed persons, as for their reuenues, birth, vertue, or other like respect: as in Megara they created their Magistrats out of the number of those that conspired and made war togither against the people, &amp; the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>by election or by lot. Againe, these things are coupled, so that some Magistrats are created by some, others by all, others out of all, others out of some o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

out of certaine companies &amp; fellowships vntil they haue passed ouer al the citizens, or alwaies out <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> of all, &amp; sometimes in one manner, sometimes in another. Likewise they are created either some out of all by election, or out of all by lot: or out of some by election, or out of some by lot: or some after one manner, some after another. I say some out of all by lot, some by election: so that beside the two couplings there are twelue sorts, of which ordinances two are popular, viz. that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrats be created by all out of all by election or by lot: or both these two together, partly by ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, partly by lot: but not to ordaine them by all together, but out of all: or out of some by lot or by election, or in both sorts: or some out of all, some out of certaine, in both sorts, yet partly by lot, partly by election, this is Commonweale like: but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as all are created out of all, some by election, others by lot, or in both sorts, partly by lot, partly by election, it is Oligarchicall: &amp; yet more Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garchical,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> when it is in both sorts. But when as some are created out of all, or some out of some, partly by election, partly by lot, it is Aristocratical; &amp; when some out of some, it is Oligarchical. Likewise by some out of some not in like sort, or by some out of some in both sorts; but as by some out of all, it is not Oligarchical: but of some by al by way of election, it is Aristocratical. There are so many sorts or maners of ordaining Magistracies, which are diuided according to the forms of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweales: but for which of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which are fit and behoofeful, and how the Magistracies should be ordained with power &amp; authority, and what they are, it may easily be vnderstood, by the power &amp; authority of the Magistracy, I mean an ouerseeing of the taxes &amp; subsidies, or of the prison. There is another kind of power, as of the Generall in war, &amp; of him that hath charge of ciuile contracts <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> and sutes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second part of Commonweales consisteth in Magistrates, which are properly those that haue power to deliberate, iudge, and commaund, but cheefly to command. Some Magistracies are necessary in euery City, others not necessary, yet profitable; which great and rich Cities vse: for smal Cities hauing few sufficient men, are constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to commit many offices to one man. Then all kinds of Magistracies are not fit or behoofefull for all Commonweales, but some are profitable for some Commonweales, and other for others: neither are all created in the same manner, but some by lot, others <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> by election, wherein there are three points to bee considered. The first, to knowe who they are which create Magistrates: the second, out of what estate of men: the third, in what sort: as whether all ought to be chosen out of all, or some out of all, or some out of some; by election or by lot, according to the diuer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> 8. chapter of the same booke he affirmeth, that there is no greater rule to bee obserued in euery Commonweale, then to prouide by the lawes that the publicke <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the same way shew the seueral maners. The difference then of iudgements consisteth in three points, viz. out of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whereupon, &amp; in what maner. I say, out of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that is, whether out of al or out of some: wherupon, that is, how many kinds of iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts there are: in what manner they ought to be created, whether by lot, or by election. We will first di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish how many kinds of iudgements there are: they are eight in nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber; One for calling of the Magistrats to accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: the other against those that publickely offend: the third belongeth to the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweale: the fourth is of differences rising between the Magistrates &amp; priuat men, concerning fines &amp; penalties: the fift is of particular contracts or bargaines of importance, and of criminall causes, &amp; strange matters, [the kinds of criminal causes are either amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the same iudges, or amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> others, whether done of purpose or by constraint; &amp; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the case is confessed, yet some doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it hath ben iustly done:] The sixt is, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they who are accused of homicide, be in prison vnder the earth, as in Athens that which they call the iudgement of a Well; but few such crimes are euer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted, euen in great cities.

Some iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts are priuat, others publick; &amp; some criminal, others ciuile. Priuat iudgements are of seruitudes, prescriptions, guardianships, bargaines, testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, successions, marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; wherof the said Plato hath treated in his 6. &amp; 8. booke of lawes. Publick iudgements

are of treasons, sacrileges, extortions, falshood, thefts, murders, whether wilfull or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> enforced, whereof Plato speaketh in the 9. booke of his said lawes. Then he treateth of publick &amp; priuat iudgements togither, &amp; of such things as are necessary for both, in the 12. book: how Iudges are to be ordained in the 6. book: what they ought to know &amp; do, in the said 12. book, &amp; what manner of men they ought to be, in the 3. of his Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale.

The Senators were for a time the only Iudges of all causes, but Tiberius and Caius Gracchi, who were altogether popular, to diminish the Senates authority &amp; increase the peoples, added 300 Roman knights, being as many as there were Senators, &amp; they caused the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of al causes to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to these 600.

Paulus Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutius in his book of Laws, doth diligently treat of the manners which was obserued in the election of Iudges. Budeus in his former &amp; latter annotations on the Pandects, hath obserued many notable points touching the maner of the Romane iudgements, which they that are desirous to know farther thereof, may read. As also that which Gruchius hath gathered in the first book of the Roman elections, declaring principally what were the kinds of the Roman iudgements in the time of Cicero. And Sigonius in his second booke of the ancient law of the Romane Citizens, chap. 18: who following the custome of the Romanes, puts such difference betweene the Magistrates and the iudges, that the Magistrates appointed the iudges, or interposed an edict: the Iudges hauing vnderstood <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> the cause, gaue iudgement: the one assembled the Iudges, the other came to sit in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at their appointment.

At the last it was thought best to keep the courts for iudgements, in one cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain place, &amp; to build an hal for that purpose at Paris, being the cheefe city of the realm, wherevpon in the time of Philip the faire, or of Lewis Hurin (as Gaguin thinketh) the pallace was founded by Enguerran de Marigny Earle of Longueuille, high Treasurer of France, in that greatnes &amp; stately magnificence as we see it now with hals &amp; chambers, wherin the iudges of ciuile &amp; criminal causes without further appeale, were disposed &amp; distributed by certain co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panies.

The court of requests, where are iudged at the first propounding, the causes of those that are of the kings traine, or others who are priuiledged. The auditory of the maisters of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests of the houshold, who iudge of the titles of offices.

In like sort publicke states are established, increased, maintained, brought low, changed, destroied, conuerted, and restored, one by another, through the order of Nature: the power of those states being the more as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and of longer continuance, vvhich are the better grounded on Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Iustice: yet are they not perpetuall, how good soeuer a forme of gouernment be there established, for vve see that all doe vvast in processe of time, and finally perish by their owne proper and naturall corruptions vvhich do follow and accompany them, in like sort, as diseases come to beasts, blasting to corne, rottennesse to vvood, rust to brasse and yron; each thing hauing his proper and invvard euil, vvhich doth consume it, though it escape all other outward hurts.

               <p>The Philosophers purpose is to treat in this booke of the changes of Estates, and to shew the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> causes thereof: and by what meanes euery forme of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monweale is preserued &amp; destroied.

               <p>The most seditions doe happen, because that (as all men confesse) in the distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of honours, equality must bee proportionally obserued in euery Commonweale; yet some being equall in one thing only, as the poore men in Democraties are equally <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> free, will be absolutely equall in all things.

For the auoiding of which inconueniences and preuenting of the grudges and discontents of such persons, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisit to entermixe the Arithmeticall and Geometricall equality: the Arithmetical be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it selfe euill, distributing by Lot the publick honors &amp; commodities to all alike; and the Geometrical impossible to be obserued, though it be good of it selfe, hauing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect alwaies to euery mans desert and worth.

The reason is, because men assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble themselues into a Citie, not to liue only, but rather to liue well. Whereto, sith the good and vertuous men doe yeeld greatest furtherance, it is meet, that the greatest part of gouernement in the City bee assigned to vertue: the third of the Politickes, Chap. 6.</p>

Whereupon to appease them, the said Senate and Nobles were enforced to graunt them greater au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, then in reason they should haue had: from whence sprang all their discords and ciuile dissentions that happened afterwards. At Venice the Gentlemen who are Lords, haue the whole rule, and diuide among themselues all the offices and charges wherein there is any honour and profite: whereat the other Citizens, among whome there are many both wise, rich, and of great courage, doe meruellously repine, and are mightily discontented. Likewise in the Cities and territories subiect vnto them, those that are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> Noblemen and of power, are very much kept downe, by reason of the feare which that Signorie hath alwaies had, least by giuing credite and authority to the people, they should raise any mutinie.</p>

Euery mans Nobility (saith he) is honoured in his Countrey, because it is a probable thing, that of the better Parents the better children are borne: for Nobility is vertue by descent. And in the fourth book,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> chap. 4.

And in the eight chapter of the same booke, There are three things which striue for equality in the Commonweale, to wit, libertie, riches, and vertue, for the fourth which is called Nobility, followes the two latter, sith Nobility is auncient riches and vertue. Osorius a Portugall hath lately written a booke of Nobility, which is translated into the French tongue. Nowe adaies they are called Gentlemen who liue on their landes without taking any paines, or vsing any Trade, whereby to get their liuing: They haue Castles and fortresses, and a certaine num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of subiects and vassals which yeeld them fealtie and homage, as in France, Spaine, Germany, in the kingdome of Naples, and in Lumbardie. At Venice the Gentlemen <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> haue not much lands and possessions, but their substance consisteth in moueables and Merchandise, neither haue they any Castle or iurisdiction: so that such manner of Nobility is accounted but a title of preheminence to distinguish them from the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and those of base estate.</p>

Not long since the Commonweale of Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence was changed into a Duchie.

The vnequall persons which be seene commonly in countries, are Princes, gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, villains, poore, rich, learned, vnlearned, merchants, soldiors, husbandmen, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificers: who in a well ordered State, should and ought to be intreated and handled ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their callings, without giuing that to the one which pertaineth to the other. But aboue al things rewards must be yeelded-according to vertue, and punishments ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to offences: Els cannot publique vnitie and concord be maintained, nor the Commonweale preserued. For as the world is not composed of semblant and like ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but of those that are differing one from another, and yet agreeing by proportion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>(as Galen sayth in his booke of Mixtures, and Hippocrates in his booke of Mans nature, and Plato in the same Timeus and in his Phoedon, the not naturall excesse and want whereof and changing from one place into another that is not agreeable, breedeth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward sedition and sicknesse) so the citie is not constituted of men equall alike, but diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in kind, as is set downe in the second booke of the Politikes the first chapter: and the third booke, the first chapter: who are vnited by proportionall handling, and disuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by vnequalitie. Wherefore Aristotle saith very wel in his great Morals, that propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion holdeth the Citie together, for that all persons are knit together therein by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, which is the cause of mutual concord and good wil amongst them. The breach <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of proportion filleth a State with hatreds, dissentions, mislikings, and grudges, whereof seditions and ciuile wars doe grow. In the time of king Lewis the eleue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th, many French princes and lords conspired against him, as malcontent for that he called them not ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vsed their counsaile in the directing of the great affaires and important matters of the kingdome, but was counselled and gouerned by meane men: and they rose vp in armes together, vnder colour that they would take order in matters concerning the Commonweale: as <hi>Philip de Comines</hi> reporteth in the first booke of his remembrances.</p>

For when they are all equall and free by nature, they ought all to haue part in the gouernment, whether it be good or bad, and to gouerne one after another as their turns fall, and for a certaine time, as is set downe in the second booke of Politiques the first chapter: as they doe at Venice, a few States excepted: and Genoa, Noremberg, Ausburgh, Strasburgh, Lubec, and commonly in al Signories &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munalties.

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> THE <hi>other in dignity.</hi>] By proportion, as 421, wherein double proportion is found. For as much as the knowledge of this matter is most profitable and necessarie, and not vnderstood by all men, we will stand a little vpon it, and rehearse it more amply for the better interpretation of this place, and the fift booke of manners. First we will presup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> (as is written in the Predicaments, and the sixt chapter of the second booke of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Philosophie) that equalitie or vnequality is the property of quantity, in as much as all thinges comparable in equalnesse, or vnequalnesse, are comprised vnder the ioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or seuered quantity, and haue betweene them proportion of numbers, or of greatnesse. Therefore Proportion, as Iordane affirmeth in his second booke, is a certaine referrence or comparison of two things, all of one kind betweene themselues: or as saith Euclide in his fift booke, a certaine habitude or comparison of quantities, all of one kind, which in Greeke hee calleth <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Boetius in his first booke of Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meticke, the seuenteenth and eighteenth chapter, nameth the proportion of numbers,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> Arithmetical proportion; for that the Arithmetritians consider onely the kind of quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity which consisteth of seuered parts, and the proportion of number, which is from equall to equall, as from two to two; or from a bigger to a lesser number, as 4. to 2. or from a lesser to a greater, as from 2. to 4. and extending infinitely, retaineth alwaies the selfesame difference of excesse, as 1.2.3,4.5.6.7.8. where alwaies the next number ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth it, which is next vnto it by an vnity, or 3.6.9.12.15. by three. But the Geometri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian doth further consider the habitude or comparison of all bignesses, and therefore the proportion of bignesses, is properly called Geometricall, as hee compareth line to line, outside to outside, and body to body. Nowe, as one number may bee compared to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> another, being equall, bigger, or lesser: Such comparison of proportions, is called by Euclide in his fift booke <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: By Boetius in his second booke of Arithmeticke, and by Iordane in his tenth booke, proportionality and proportion of proportions: yet the Geometrician applieth it particularly to equall or semblant proportions, that is to say, such as haue semblant and like denomination, which is named sole, or only propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionality, to wit, similitude or likenesse of proportions, and equality, and mediety. The one of them is called Arithmeticall, and the other Geometricall. Arithmetical propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionality is an habitude or comparison of quantities, surmou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting one another by equal exceedings, as 10,6.8,4. For as tenne exceedeth sixe by foure, so eight exceedeth foure by foure, and so is it of all other numbers, disposed by naturall order; which when they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> be infinitely extended, doe alwaies keepe all one, and the selfesame difference. Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricall proportionality is a comparison of quantities that haue semblant and like Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metricall proportion, as 8,4.6,3. bee: For there is a double proportion of the first to the second, and of the third to the fourth, &amp; as 8. be to 4. so are 6. to 3. And the other way, as 3. are to 6. so be 4. to 8. which is subdouble proportion. Euery of those proportionalties,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:7218:141"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> may be of ioined and fastened parts, or of seuered and vncoupled parts. They call it ioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or fastened, where there is such proportion of the first tearme or bounder to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, as there is of the second to the third, and of the third to the fourth, as 8,4.2,1. do declare it in Geometricall proportion, and 8,6,4,2. in Arithmeticall proportion. The which ioined or fastened mediety may be made in foure or moe tearmes, and if there be but three, the middle serueth to both. The seuered or vncoupled mediety, is set and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted amongst tearmes that haue some interruption or breaking off from their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, as 10,5,4,2. and 12,8,6, 2. And it must haue foure tearmes or bounders at the least. Therefore Iordane saith very well, that the meanes of seuered proportionality are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> vnioined, and the meanes of fastened proportionality ioined together. Aristotle in the fift booke of his Morall Philosophy, the fourth and fift Chapters, requireth the forme of Arithmeticall equality, in iustice that pertaineth to the communicating and exchaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of things; wherein the equalnesse of things, and not of persons is necessary: and where one thing must be giuen for another, as price for Merchandise, and recompence for dammage, without any respect of persons. Otherwise, if men take alwaies on the one side, and giue nothing on the other: as out of a Marchaunts shop without paying or exchanging any thing at all, the shop at last will be empty, and the trade of exchaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ease. Therefore this Arithmeticall equality is required in contracts, as well <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> voluntary as constrained: To the end, that the communicating of things, may last for euer in the societies of men. It is also vsed in Communalities of people, in the bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and distributing of Offices, where euery one will be as high a maister as another, for the keeping of equality amongst them. In the fift booke of his Ethickes hee applieth the Geometricall mediety to the degrees of vocations, and of men, that there may bee equality, not of thinges, but of proportions; and that the degrees may bee kept. As, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Diuine, the Lawyer, the Captaine, the Senator, and the Treasurer doe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, yet for all that they ought to haue necessary correspondence, and to be made equal, not in their vocation, but by semblance and likenesse of proportions, in such sort, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> euery one shall exercise his Office without letting the others. Wherefore Plato affirms the publicke state to bee good, if it be instituted according <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o the Geometrical propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that all the welfare thereof dependeth vpon the same. The King giueth the Office of Chancellorship to a wise and learned man, that loueth vprightnesse and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke peace: and the Office of the Constableship to a good Captaine, well experienced in matters of state: The gouernement of the Church to a Diuine, that is skilfull in the Ecclesiasticall gouernement: the Office of a Iudge to a Lawyer: the Treas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rorship to one that hath skill in the ordering of the monies. Then euery one keepeth his place, &amp; exerciseth his Office, without incrochment and hinderance one of another, to the end <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> that the publicke concord bee not troubled. This order causeth equality amongst such as be vnlike and dissemblant. Plato in the sixt booke of his Lawes sayth: The old saying is true and very wel vsed, that equality breedeth friendship: But for as much as the equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity that can worke this, is scarcesly knowne, it troubleth vs. For whereas there bee two equalities, called by all one and the selfesame name, but in effect almost contrary in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things, euery City and euery Law giuer may vse the one by lots in the distributing of honours, to wit, the equality in number, weight, and measure. But it is not easie for all men to know the true and good equality, for it is the iudgement of God, and happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth sildome amongst men. But as farre as it happeneth to Cities and to perticuler per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> it causeth all welfare, it giueth more to men of great calling, and lesse to them that are of lowe degree, ordering all thinges according to their nature. Truly it giueth the most excellent men in vertue, the greatest honours; and to the vnderlings in vertue and skilfulnesse, the lesser preferments: distributing to the one and the other that which by reason appertaineth vnto them. Which is the very politicall right that wee ought to desire, and we should obserue such equality in establishing and ordering this new City, as also whosoeuer buildeth another, ought to doe and frame his Lawes according to
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:7218:142"/>
the same, not respecting some small number of Tyrants, or one, or the power of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> people, but alwaies hauing regard to right, which wee lately affirmed to distribute al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies that which is equall by nature amongst them that bee vnequall. And in Gorgias hee saith: You are not ignorant that the Geometricall equality is of much effect, both amongst the gods and men: And thinke that the most ought to be had in all things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause you dispise Geometry. Geometricall proportion is particularly vsed in Oligar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies and Aristocraties, in distributing the publicke honours and offices onely to the rich, according to their riches, and to the good according to vertue.</p>

Wherefore it behooueth to vse partly the equality <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> of number, and partly that equality, which is according to dignity. Yet the Democratie is surer &amp; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> lesse subiect to mutinie, then the Oligarchie: for in Oligarchies there arise two kinds of seditions,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> namely between the gouernors, and with the people. But in Democraties they are with the Oligar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> only, and not of the people with the people; at the least, whereof any reckoning is to be made.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/>

               <p>AND <hi>to ordaine a Commonweale simply in all respects, according to the one, or the other <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> equality, it is not good.</hi>] The Arithmeticall equality is of it selfe bad, and the Geometri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call alone cannot be altogether obserued without mutinies, but they must be mixed for the preuenting of mens discontents. Socrates in his Areopagiticall Oration, This (saith he) did much helpe and profite them in the gouernment of the City, that whereas there are two sorts of equality, of which the one giueth alike to all; the other, that only which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> is meet; they were not ignorant whether of the two was most profitable. For they left that equality which giueth alike both to the good and bad, and obserued in their afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said gouernement that other equality which distributeth honours and punishments ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to deserts, not chusing Magistrates indifferently out of the people, but out of the better sort. He doth wholly mislike the Arithmeticall equality, which is sought only by Democraticall persons, &amp; commendeth the Geometricall. Which notwithstanding must not bee obserued alone, euen in those Common-weales that are thereby ordered, <hi>viz.</hi> in Oligarchies and Aristocraties: For Riches of it selfe, or Nobility, can giue no ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute right or authority to gouerne, in such sort, that none may beare rule saue they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> who are rich or Noble: neither can vertue alone doe it, if the good and vertuous man be not in many Estates noble or rich. Likewise in a well ordered Commonweale, all Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices are not to be giuen to good men, but the principall: wherein consisteth the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the State, which are administred by sole persons, or in small number, to the end, that the rest who are not honoured but excluded from gouernement in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale, grow not discontented, or vse practises tending to innouation.</p>
               <p>SITH <hi>no such Commonweale can be of continuance.</hi>] No Democratie which doth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> simply in all points obserue the right before mentioned, according to the Arithmetical equality, is of continuance, by reason of the seditions that spring therein; nor any Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garchie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> which hath respect only to the Geometricall equality.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>reason is, because it is impossible that from an errour committed at the first, and from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> a bad beginning, there proceed not a bad end.</hi>] The beginning is of such force in all things, that things well begun, are accounted halfe done; but things ill begunne, haue sildome good euent. Wherefore it is no meruell, if these two formes of Commonweales do not prosper, but soone decay, sith that from their beginning they are not grounded on the true and equall right, but on an outward apparence only.</p>
               <p>WHEREFORE <hi>it behoueth to vse partly the equality of number, and partly that equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> which is according to dignity.</hi>) For the well establishing of a Commonweale, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> it from seditions, it is requisite to mixe and temper these two equalities toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Plato in the sixt of his Lawes: It is necessary for euery Citty which would be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether exempted from sedition, to vse these two equalities, hauing like denomination. For this commendable equity, and equall discerning of that which is perfect and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, is violated, if it be not done with right iudgement. Wherefore it is expedient to vse the equality of Lots, thereby to auoid the giuing of offence to many. And in this behalf God and good Fortune are to bee praied vnto, that the lot may bee directed to fall on
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:7218:143"/>
the best and iustest. So then both these sorts of equality must bee vsed of necessity, but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> that sort the lesse, which hath need of Fortune. For this cause therefore this order must bee thus obserued by that Cittie which desireth continuance &amp; safety. And in another place of the same booke: Amongst the Magistrates which are chosen by the proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their wealth or reueuues, the one halfe should bee created by lot, and bee Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours for a yeare; which kind of creation will bee a middle forme betweene the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchicall and Democraticall: of which two formes the Commonweale ought alwaies to keepe the meane. For otherwise the lords and slaues will neuer agree, nor the good and bad Cittizens, if they doe not equally participate in publicke honors. For amongst men that are vnequall, equall things doe become vnequall, if they receaue not a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> measure. It doth therefore hereby appeare, and Experience the Mistresse &amp; tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of things, doth sufficiently shewe, that these two sorts of equalitie must be mixed in a well ordered Commonweale. For wee see that all humane society, both in priuate and publicke, consisteth in the due communication or commutation of things, and in the order or degrees of persons. The communication of things is made by contracts or bargaines, wherein great equalitie must bee obserued by Arithmeticall proportion, which doth simply retaine an equall difference among many numbers. For this cause the penaltie of like for like called <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Touching persons and Offices, they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> are ordered and appointed by degrees in Citties and in priuate families. In Cities there are cheefe, meane, and inferiour Magistracies: in families there are diuerse degrees, as of Parents, Children, Brethren and Sisters, Lords and Slaues: which order of persons must bee established by Geometricall proportion, retaining the equalitie of propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to wit, in giuing euery man his place, and vsing him according to his quality and desert.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> chap. 11. hee saith that Democraties are surer, and of longer continuance, by reason of those of meane estate who are there in greater number, and haue more interest in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke honours. There are commonly in all Cities three sorts of people, of whom some are very rich, as in Oligarchies: some very poore, as in Democraties: the third sort are meane betweene both, neither very poore, nor very rich. And where manie such haue authoritie of gouernment, without doubt the state of that Cittie is more assured and lesse troubled with sedition. For those Cittizens who are very rich, or very poore, are not fit for the maintaining of humane society. The rich are prowd, disdainefull, and prone to offer iniuries: the poore malicious and enuious, and they cannot long <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> remaine together without tumults and factions. So that they which are the stronger falling to quarrels, and hauing the aduantage on their enemies, doe alwaies cause the state of the Commonweale to encline on their side. If they bee poore, they establish a Democratie: if they be rich, an Oligarchie. And because the most part of men are such, and there are few of meane estate, this is the reason why we see more Democraties and Oligarchies then other formes of Commonweales. But the meane sort of Cittizens doe neither desire other mens goods as the poore doe, neither are they insolent, as the rich are: and by this meanes they mainetaine publicke amitie, and eschewe seditions. Wherefore that Commonweale which is gouerned by men of meane substance, is the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> best and of longest continuance. Neither can there happen any greater good to all Estates for their safetie, then to haue those for their Gouernours, who are meanly rich, otherwise they fall presently into Monarchicall or Popular Tyrannies, or (which is worse) are vtterly destroied.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. From vvhence seditions spring, and of their causes.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>SIth we are come to consider from whence seditions and chaunges in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweales doe spring, we will first touch in generall the beginnings and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> thereof, which are about three in number, and wee will breefly discourse them each seuerally by it selfe. First of all we must know howe men are dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> or made prone to sedition: next, wherefore they raise it: Thirdly, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t are the beginnings of ciuile troubles, and of the mutinies or tumults which arise amongst them. The cause by which they are disposed to the desire of a change, is that in generall, whereof we haue lately spoken, viz. that some in seeking equality doe mutine, if they thinke that they haue lesse, being themselues equall to those that haue more. Others seeking ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitie and preheminence doe likewise mutine, if being vnequall, they persuade themselues that they haue not more, but alike or lesse. Nowe, these things may sometimes bee iustly desired, and sometimes vniustly. The reason is, because being inferiour, they contend for equality; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing equall, for superioritie. Hereby it appeareth, how they are disposed to sedition, and desire of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> innouation. The thinges for which they contend, are profite, and honour, and their contraries. For in seeking to shunne dishonour, or daunger, either of themselues, or of their friendes, they trouble Cities and Estates with sedition. The causes and beginnings of the motiues which dispose them in the aforesaid manner, and for the thinges by vs men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, may bee seuen in number, and somewhat more; two whereof are the same that the former are, but not in the same manner. For profite and honour doe prouoke them to quarrell, and contend together, not thereby to purchase them for themselues,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:7218:144"/>
as we said before, but because they see others more aduanced, some iustly and some vniustly. They <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> are likewise prouoked by reason of iniuries, feare, prepotence, contempt, excessiue encrease, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> otherwise of shame, negligence, pusillanimity, and vnlikenesse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In euery sedition there are three points to be considered. The first, how men are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed or made prone to the raising of it: The second, to what end they mutine: The third, what the motiue cause thereof is. Equality or inequality in Democraties or Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garchies, doe dispose and incline men to discord. The ends or finall causes thereof are profite and honour; and their contraries, dammage and dishonour. The motiues which prouoke them to sedition, are set downe to the number of seuen, namely, honor <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> and profit, enioyed by some aboue their deserts, for which cause the rest repine at them: iniuries, feare, prepotence, contempt, excessiue and disproportionall encrease of some part of the Cittie, or of some per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>on: to which motiues there are added foure other, <hi>viz.</hi> shame, negligence, pusillanimity, and vnlikenesse.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> WE <hi>will first touch in generall the beginnings and causes thereof.</hi>] There are foure kinds of causes set downe by Philosophers, the efficient, materiall, formall, and finall cause. The efficient cause of seditions is double, the one a neere, the other, a remote cause. The neere cause are the Authours thereof, by whose counsell, direction, and aide <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> they are raised and performed. By the remote cause we vnderstand those things, for, and through which they are prouoked thereunto: and these are set downe by Aristotle to the number of eleuen. The Authors of seditions are either Magistrats, as were at Rome Tiberius, and Caius Gracchus brethren, Sylla, Marius, Apuleius, Caesar, Antonius, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidus: or priuate men, as Catiline and Manlius. In the Romane Hystories we may find, that certaine slaues haue ben the Authours of seditions, as Herdonius Sabinus, which raised the warre called <hi>Bellum seruile</hi>; and one named Eunus a Syrian, who gathered a power of more then forty thousand slaues in Sicile, and hauing put on Kingly attire, ranged through the Island, wasting and spoiling it. There was also another borne in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licia,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> who did as much mischeefe. Spartacus a sword-player rising against the State of Rome, fought many times with the Romane Consuls, whom he discomfited in battaile, but afterward was vanquished by L. Crassus. The materiall cause of seditions are they against whome they are raised, of whome some are superiours, as Princes and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates; and some inferiours, who are subiect vnto them. The end or finall cause of sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is that thing for which they are raised. Aristotle setteth downe foure ends thereof, namely, profite, and honour; and their contraries, dammage and dishonour: for men are commonly stirred thereunto through hope of profite and honour, or through feare of dammage and infamy, as well of themselues as of their friends, desiring the one, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> shunning the other. To profite, we referre riches: to honour, Magistracies, Offices, and publicke charges: to dammage, pouertie: to dishonour, continuall iniuries, contempt, and such like, which although they are numbred among the motiue and efficient cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of seditions, because they prouoke men, yet they may likewise bee the ends thereof, because that for the obtaining or shunning of them, men doe conspire. The forme or manner of a sedition, is a commotion of the people, noise, cries, beatings, murthers, ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile warre, surprizing of Townes, burnings, banishments. If it bee of subiects toward their superiours and lords, it is called rebellion: if betweene subiects or men of equall estate, faction. Titus Liuius in the second booke of his first Decade doth elegantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> the forme of a sedition which happened at Rome for debts, in this manner: <q>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no natu quidam cum omnium maiorum suorum insignibus se in forum proiecit, obsita erat squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lore vestis, foedior corporus habitus pallore ac macie perempti: adhoc promissa barba &amp; capilli es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>There is also another description not much vnlike to this, made by the same <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Authour in the third booke of the same Decade, of a sedition raised in this manner, for the outrage committed by Appius on the daughter of Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius:
<q>Repraesentatur mactaturus iam pater filiam abrepto ab lanio cultro: Hoc te vno quo possum (ait) modofilia inlibertatem vendico.

                  <hi>Vnlikenesse.</hi>] Plato in the eight of his Commonweale sayeth, That wheresoeuer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> there is vnlikenesse, and discordant inequalitie, there men are alwaies troubled with seditions. Hee did well to adde discordant inequalitie, because all vnlikenesse is not to bee reprooued, but that only which hath in it selfe a discordant inequalitie, and thereby may cause sedition. For the preuenting of which euill this inequali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie must bee (so much as is possible) reduced to an equality. So wee see that the world being compounded of contrarie Elements, namely, Earth, Water, Aire, and Fire is maintained and preserued by this Analogie and proportion which they haue together, and that the bodies of creatures consisting of heat, colde, drinesse,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> and moisture, are by the same meanes and manner preserued. In the maine bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of Nature, there is matter, forme, priuation, simplicitie, mixture, substance, quantitie, qualitie, action, passion: In mans bodie the head, hands, feete, eyes, nose, and eares: In the Oeconomicall bodie, the Husband, Wife, Children, Lords, Slaues, Seruaunts: In the Politicall or ciuile bodie, Magistrates, Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and Plebeians, Husbandmen; Artificers, Merchaunts. Then to preuent the seditions which proceede from vnlikenesse, wee must not remooue the vnlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses themselues, without which no Commonweale can stand, but rather the disorder growing betweene vnlike persons, and reduce them to a due agreement,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> such as the seuerall parts haue, which are seene in the constitution of the world, and of man. That vnlikenesse which breedeth sedition, whereof Aristotle spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, consisteth in diuersitie of beginning, of place, of birth, offices, professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, trades, and religions. They are vnlike in beginning and place, who are borne and brought vp in diuerse places, as an Almaigne, a Spaniard, an English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, a Frenchman, and an Italian. Philip de Comines writing of the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view which Lewys the eleuenth King of Fraunce, and Henrie King of Castile made, being the neerest allied Princes in Christendome, (for they were aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entlie confederate, not onely King with King, but Realme with Realme, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> bound vpon great and deepe curses to obserue their league) saith that the French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Spaniards by reason of the diuersitie of attire and manners, both in their Princes and themselues, ceased not during the time that they were toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to mocke, quarrell, and in the end to beate each other throughly, little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding their solemne league. The Noblemen and Plebeians are vnlike in birth: in Offices, they which haue diuerse charges; as Iudges, Treasurors, Souldiours, Priestes, of which point wee haue spoken in the former Chapter. In professions; as a Lawyer, a Phisitian, a Diuine, a Philosopher, and their followers being againe of diuerse sorts, as were amongst the Greeke Philosophers, the Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miques,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> the Perepatetiques, the Stoiques, and the Epicureans.

               <p>BESIDES the causes here alleadged which dispose men to sedition, wee may adde some other, as the nature of the places wherein men are borne: so Ammianus Marcellinus in his eleuenth booke sayeth, That Alexandria in AE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt was fatallie subiect to sedition. And Socrates in his Tripartite Hystorie writeth: That the people of Alexandria were much more enclined to sedition then

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Plato in his fift booke of Lawes sayeth thus: There must bee neither extreme pouertie, nor excessiue riches among the Citizens of that Cittie which would be exempted from the greeuous disease called dissention, or sedition. Salust in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracie of Catiline, speaketh thus of the poore men. <hi>Nam semper in ciuitate qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus opes nullae sunt, bonis inuident, males extollunt, vetera odere, noua exoptant: odio suarum rerum mutari omnia student, turba atque seditionibus sine cura aluntur, quoniam egestas facile sine damno habetur.</hi> Manie Countries haue beene much troubled with sedition, because they could not indure the excessiue multitude of inhabitants, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> thereon haue growne many transmigrations or remouings of people out of one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion into another. Likewise an Estate is enclined to sedition when it hath no enemie: as Hanniball told the Carthaginians, speaking thus in the tenth booke of the third De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cade of Liuie. <hi>Nulla magna ciuitas quiescere potest: si foris hostem non habet, domi in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenit: vt praeualida corpora ab externis causis tuta videntur, sed suis ipsa viribus one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantur.</hi> That is, No great Citty can remaine quiet; if it haue no enemie abroad, it findeth one at home: euen as great bodies, which seeme to bee safe and assured against all outward dangers, yet are surcharged and ouerladen with their owne force. For this cause Scipio Nasica was of opinion, after the victorie which the Romanes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> had of the Carthaginians, that Carthage should not bee raced, least the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes hauing no enemies, should turne their weapons against themselues, and so destroy each other; as soone after it happened: Salust in the conspiracie of Catiline. After that through labour and iustice the Commonweale was growne flourishing, great Kings subdued by warre, fierce Nations and mightie people vanquished by force, Carthage the emulous riual of the Roman Empire destroied from the verie ground, all Seas and Countries opened: then Fortune began to shewe her crueltie, and to trouble all: Ease, and Riches, which should bee wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed to others, haue beene a trouble and miserie to those who before did easilie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> endure paine, danger, doubtfull and sharpe chaunces. Wherefore God in the booke of Iudges, the third chapter, ordained that the Philistines, Canaanites, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians and Hiuites should bee left and opposed against the Israelites to trie them, saying: Therefore will I no more cast out before them any of the Nations which Iosua left when hee died. That through them I may prooue Israell, whether they will keepe the way of the Lord to walke therein as their Fathers kept it, or not. Likewise the imposing of newe subsidies dooth mooue men to sedition,

Immediately after the deceasse of Salomon, the Iewes rebelling against Roboam by reason of the taxes which hee would not moderate, diuided themselues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two Realmes, namely, of Iuda and Israell: the first book of the Kings, chapter twelue.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> All Spaine being gouerned by Flemmings, reuolted against them by reason of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions that they vsed: which commotion is described by Paulus Iouius in the life of Pope Adrian the fixt.

The diuision of lands propounded at Rome in the law called <hi>Lex agraria,</hi> was the beginning of the seditions among the Romanes, and caused the death of the two Gracchi, brethren, who were the Authors thereof.

For if Commonweales were therefore ordained at the first, that vnder the protection and gouernement of good Magistrates men might quietly pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse their owne, then doubtlesse they which rule Estates ought cheefly to haue care,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> that not onely the publicke treasure be disposed and employed according to the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity and profit of the Commonweale, but also that particular men may quietly enioy their goods.</p>

                  <hi>It is likewise manifest, what force Honour hath, and in what sort it is the cause of sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

               <p>Feare is a perturbation of the mind for some imminent or future daunger. That also which is done by force or violence, seemeth to bee done by feare.

               <p>Commonly those men are contemned, who haue neither vertue, courage, nor po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, being therefore vnable to helpe themselues or others, and who haue no industrie nor care. Where contempt is, there can bee no obedience, the sonne disobeyeth his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whom he contemneth, the wife her husband, the scholler his teacher, the seruaunt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> his Maister. Euen beastes haue some feeling of the quality of those whome they must serue, as wee may reade of the horses of Alexander the great, and Iulius Caesar, who would not suffer any other to sit on them. Wherefore it is no maruell; that amongst men the opinion of Prudence, Iustice, Constancie, Knowledge, Bounty, Modestie, and other vertues doth nourish and mainetaine obedience towards them, and the contrarie vices prouoke subiects to rebell against their Lords. Then as States doe prosper, being gouerned by wise, iust, constant, valiant, and temperate persons, so they are troubled with seditions through the imprudence, cowardise, and intemperance of their rulers: or when they are too familiar with inferiour persons, or are come from base estate, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> sodainly aduanced, or seeme too young, old, poore, vnfortunate, all which things breed contempt. Cicero doth elegantly and excellently teach in his second booke of Offices howe the honour and dignity of those that gouerne Commonweales, and the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of their subiects, towards them, may be maintained. But sedition doth not spring in Commonweales then onely when inferiours contemne their superiours, but also when one degree contemneth another: as in the Oligarchie, the poore making no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the rich, because themselues are more in number, and stronger then they, doe conspire against them. Likewise in the Democratic, the rich contemning the disorder of the poore which gouerne, doe easily attempt to suppresse and put them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> downe.</p>

There is no doubt, that the agreement of these Estates hath caused the Realme to continue and prosper so long amongst all other auncient and moderne king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes; the publicke commodities, honours, and charges being ordinarily deuided ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the condition of euery Estate, without abridging their rights and prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minences, especially in taking diligent heed, that neither of them doe aboue measure exceede the other, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Nobility doe not too much oppresse the people, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> thereby driue them to despaire, (the ommitting of which diligent heed, hath oft cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the people to rise, wherof hath ensued great mischeefe) or that the people by means of Merchandise, iudgements, and disposing of the publicke reuenues, together with the gainefull priuiledges by them possessed, should not ouer-greatly enrich themselues to the preiudice of the Nobilitie, and purchase the Noblemens lands, who being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouerished, could not be able to sustaine the charges of the warre, nor serue the King in his armies, whereto it is most necessary to haue alwaies speciall regard for the saf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Commonweales are likewise changed by reason of shame, as it happened at Heraea, where the Magistrates which before were chosen by election, were afterwards created by lot, because that while the manner of election was obserued, they bestowed the publick offices on men of no worth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Heraea was a Citty of Arcadia, whose gouernement was popular, wherein men of no worth were chosen Magistrates by such as were like themselues; for which the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raeans being derided, changed their custome of election into the vse of lots, thereby to shunne like derision. There was not long since in the counsell of Fraunce an excessiue number of maisters of requests, extraordinarie; and Secretaries for the Office of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> Treasurie, which were afterward for very shame caused to withdraw themselues, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnseemely and vnmeet to treat of high and weightie affaires, which should be kept secret, in such a multitude.</p>

                  <hi>And by reason of negligence, when they suffer those to attaine to soueraigne Offices, who are not friends to the Commonweale, as at Oreum, the Oligarchie was destroyed by Heracleodorus, who being become a Magistrate, changed the said Oligarchie into a Commonweale, and a Democratie.</hi>

The second negligence is of those, who being called to any dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie or office, shewe themselues slacke and carelesse in the administration and exercise <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> thereof, as we see that the most part of the Bishops and Prelates, regard not the dutie of their Ecclesiasticall charges, that they may more freely follow secular affaires, and for this cause they are contemned: From which disorder there haue risen great scandales and meruellous troubles, which may more easily be lamented then remoued or refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, because abuses haue through long time taken deepe root.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> FVRTHERMORE, <hi>the changes of Estates do grow by little and little: I say, by little &amp; little, because many times there happeneth a great change both of manners and lawes, without being perceiued, through the neglecting of some small thing: as in Ambracia where they aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to offices men of small reuenues, and in the end they admitted those that had none at all: as if nothing and little were neere in nature, or not any whit different.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Changes, vnlesse they be very violent, doe sildome happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all at once, but are ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily bred by little and little, euen as the seasons of the yeare doe by degrees passe from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> excessiue heat to excessiue cold, and from Winters sharpenesse to Summers extremity. Wherefore it is farre more difficult to remedy or preuent them, because commonly men take no heed to euils and dangers, vntill they be growne great: as Aristotle sayeth in the 6. booke of the Politickes, chap. 4. Whosoeuer will consider the change that hath happened in Fraunce within these thirtie yeares, shall find it to be very great, as well in religion, as in manners and Lawes; yet hath it not chanced all at one time, but by little and little, as it grew on by continuance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Likewise, when the inhabitants of one place are not all natiue there, this breedeth sedition <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> among them, vntill they grow to a generall accord. For as a City is not composed of euery mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, so also it is not constituted in euery time. Wherefore, all they that haue hetherto receiued strangers into their cities to dwell therein with them, haue for the most part beene troubled with seditions. As the Achaians dwelt with the Troezenians in the City of Sybaris, and afterward be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grown stronger then they, draue them out: which thing caused great euill to the Sybarites, who did the like among the Thurians to those that dwelt with them: for seeking to appropriate to themselues the greater part of that territory, as if it had beene their owne, they were discomfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and exp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And the Antissae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> hauing receiued the banished Chians, did afterward expulse them likewise by plain force.

And when the Syracusans being freed from their Tyrans, had made many stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and hired souldiers, fellow Citizens with them; they were so troubled likewise with seditions, that in the end they fell to fighting. And the Amphipolites by taking into their city the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidians were almost all driuen out by them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is commonly seene, that the naturall inhabitants of a Citty do seldome agree with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> strangers dwelling amongst them: and of such differences there doe oft spring sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as it appeareth by the examples which Aristotle alledgeth, for confirmation wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, we may adde that of Geneua, whether many strangers repairing, as well Frenchmen as others, for religion, they were alwaies maligned and repined at by the naturall Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, although they had done great good vnto their Citty, which by reason of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire thether grew rich and populous, whereas before it was poore and small: &amp; there haue beene many conspiracies made against them, to expulse or kill them, especially that which Perin plotted in the yeare 1556. which was begun to bee effected and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted when Caluine thrust himselfe betweene the naked swords to appease the tumult: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> as Beza reporteth in his life. But touching this receiuing of strangers, great regard is to bee had to their number, whether it be small or great: for if being fewe, they quarrell with the naturall inhabitants, there is lesse danger; but if they exceede them in number and power, then through confidence in their owne strength, they will soone raise sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Likewise men that are of different manners, doe hardly agree at the beginning, but when they haue long remained and dwelt together, they doe in kind and quiet sort conuerse each with other.

The Lacedemonians permitted no straungers to dwell amongst them.

But the Romanes were herein more courteous, who did not only receiue strangers into their Citie, graunting them the right and freedome thereof, but did also aduance them to publicke honours and Offices, to which purpose there is an excellent Oration made by the Emperour Claudius to the Senate, recorded by Cornelius Tacitus in the eleuenth booke of his history of the Caesars: <hi>Nam cùm (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit Tacitus) de supplendo Senatu ageretur, ac primores Galliae qui foedera &amp; ciuitatem Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam pridem assecuti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>In Oligarchies many men doe raise sedition, as if they were iniured, because being equall, as we said before, they haue not an equall part in gouernement: and in Democraties the Noblemen <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> grow discontented, when they haue but an equall part, although they bee not equall, but su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These quarrels springing from inequality in Democraties and Oligarchies between the Noblemen and the people, haue been at large discoursed of in the third booke, and in the beginning of this fift booke. In euery Estate, they that are not esteemed and vsed

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> according to their desert and quality, repute themselues iniuried, and oft times they seeke redresse by raising mutinies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sometimes Cities are troubled with seditions, by reason of the places wherein they are scitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, when the nature of the Countrey is not fit for the constituting of a city: as at Clazomene they that dwelt in Chitrum, bore grudge and hatred against those of the Island; and the Colophonians against the Notians. And at Athens they are not all enclined alike: but they of Piceum are more popular then those of the City. For as in warres the passing of trenches, although they bee small, doth breake the souldiors array, and disorber the battailes, in like sort, euery difference in a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> City doth seeme to breed dissension.</hi>

At ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time they were constrained to build in the Citty the Fortresse <hi>de petit Po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t,</hi> that is, of the little bridge, against the tumults which the schollers made: as Gaguin writeth in his ninth booke. Philip de Comines likewise in his fifth booke, the fifteenth Chapter, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> sayth, That in Arras there were wals and trenches betweene the Towne and the Citty, and gates to shut against the saied Cittie while the Burgonians were maisters thereof, but afterward when the Frenchmen held it, the Cittie was shut against the Towne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Cittie tooke part with France, and the Towne with Burgoine. One part of the Cittie of Trent speaketh Italian, and liueth after the Italian manner, the other part spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the Germane tongue, and liueth after the manner of that Countrey. At Athens they that dwelt in the Hauen Piraeum, which was ioined to the Cittie by a long &amp; thick wall (as we haue noted in the beginning of Platoes Commonweale) did more affect the Democratie. Moreouer, Plutarch in the life of Solon writeth (as wee haue already she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> in the last chapter of the second booke) that in the Countrey of Attica there were as many factions as there were diuerse sorts of the territorie: for the Mountainers were Democraticall; those of the champion countrey, Oligarchical; and they that dwelt neer the sea, desired a middle kind of gouernement, consisting of both formes, whereby wee may know, that Plato in the beginning of Timeus, and in the end of his fift booke of Lawes, hath written most truly, that there is great difference of places for the disposing and fashioning of mens manners, which point is grauely handled by Hippocrates in that little treatise that hee wrote of the aire, of waters, and of places; as also by Galen, shewing that the affections of the mind follow the temperature of the body. We haue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> also noted in the former chapter that some places are naturally, and as it were by some destiny, seditious. Likewise, when a place is vnfit for habitation by reason of barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse or any other like cause, the Citty therein scituated, is prone to sedition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Peraduenture the greatest dissention is betweene vertue and vice, and next to that, betweene richesse and pouerty; and so of the rest, one more then another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sith vice and vertue are contrary, there must needs be dissention betweene them, yet they who excell in vertue (as Aristotle sayth in the beginning of this booke) doe neuer vse to raise sedition when they are repulsed, or others of little or no worth preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> them, as at Rome it happened to Cato: although they haue iust occasion of anger, because that by reason they ought to bee absolutely and onely vnequall, and preferred before all others. Touching the Noble and rich men, this is their common fault, that they are almost all prowd and disdainers of the poore and vulgar sort, so that it is a very difficult matter to keepe these two degrees of people in quiet, in whatsoeuer forme of gouernment they liue: as we haue shewed at large by reasons and examples, as well an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient as moderne, in the sixt chapter of the third booke.</p>

And at Delphos a certaine quarrell being raised about a marriage, was the beginning of all the seditions that rose afterward in that Citie: For the spouse hauing had some signe of ill lucke, at his return to hir <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> vnto whom hee was betrothed, refused to marry her; Wherupon the maids friends, as being here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in dispised and wronged, conueyed on him while he was sacrificing, some of the consecrated things of the Temple, and afterward caused him to be slaine, as one guiltie of sacriledge. And at Miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lene a certaine controuersie arising about the inheritance of two maidens that were Orphanes, was the occasion of much hurt, and of the warre betweene the Mitilenians and the Athenians, wherein Paches tooke their City. For Timophanes a wealthy man deceasing, left behind him two daughters coheires: Doxander who had demanded them in mariage for his sonnes, being deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, raised sedition, and incited the Athenians (who comming to Mitilene, were alwaies lodged at his hous<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Amongst the Phocians likewise there grew dissention about <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> an inheritance betweene Mnaseas the father of Mneson, and Euthycrates the father of Onomar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus, from which dissention the holy warre arose.

And in another place hee sayth, Cato <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> stepping forth did with a lowd voice before all the assembly foretell (as if hee had beene inspired by some diuine propheticall spirit) all that which would happen through these practises to the Commonweale: a little after hee saith thus; When the edict was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded touching the Prouinces and armies which Caesar required, Cato adressed not himselfe vnto the people for the hindering thereof, but to Pompey, denouncing &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing vnto him that he did put on his owne necke Caesars yoke, which as then hee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued not, but that soone after hee would feele the weight thereof, and find himselfe therewith surcharged and taken, and that then when hee could no longer endure it, nor find any meanes to shake it off, he would cast both himself and his burthen on the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweale,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> and too late remember Catoes warnings, which were no lesse profitable to him in particular, then iust and reasonable in themselues. Cato did sundrie times vse like speeches vnto him, but Pompey made no account thereof, for hee could not beleeue that Caesar would change, and besides, hee trusted too much in his owne pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie, and in the greatnesse of his power. Thus hauing strengthened and aduaunced Caesar against himselfe and the Commonweale, hee did deseruedly feele the smart of his follie therein committed. Caesar on the other side hauing from the beginning ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at Pompeys ouerthrowe, and to make himselfe greater; like a skilfull wrastler, whose onely studie is how to trip and foile his aduersary, got himselfe farre from Rome,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> and to exercise himselfe in the warres of Gaule, where hee trained his armie, and did so much augment his own glory by his admirable deeds of armes, that he did equal Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peys explots, so that there rested nothing els for executing &amp; effecting of his purpose, saue onely some coloured occasions, which partly Pompey, and partly the time did afford and offer him: and all this grewe through the bad gouernement which was then in the Commonweale of Rome.

And at Chalcis after that the people had expulsed the Tyran and the Nobility, they did forthwith vndertake to rule the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweale themselues. Likewise, at Ambracia, hauing driuen out the Tyran Periander, and those of his faction, they tooke on themselues the gouernment of the state. To bee short, we must not bee ignorant, that all they by whose meanes the power of any state hath ben augmented, whether they be priuate men or Magistrates, or some tribe and linage, or some parts of the City, or whatsoeuer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> multitude, do raise sedition: For either they who enuy their honor, do mutine, or els themselues by reason of the power which they haue gotten, will not be content with an estate equall to the rest.</hi>

                  <hi>Furthermore, Commonweales are changed, when the parts of the City which seeme contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> are made equal; as the rich men, and the inferiour multitude; and when the middle or meane part is little or none at all. For if one of the parts doe much exceede, the other part will hazard nothing against that which is manifestly the stronger. Wherefore they who excell in vertue, doe sildome raise sedition, because they are few in number in respect of the rest. Then the beginnings and causes of seditions and chaunges doe happen generally in all sorts of Commonweales, after this manner.</hi>

               <p>Thirdly, changes doe happen in Commonweales, when the parts of the Citty that seeme contrary, are made equall, and the middle or meane part is little or none at all; as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> are the rich and the poore, the Noblemen and the people, of which point wee haue oft spoken in the former discourses, and will handle it againe in the chapters following: wherein Aristotles especiall purpose is to treat of the changes of Democraties &amp; Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garchies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Besides, they are changed by force, and by subtletie. By force, in constraining the Citizens to such a change, either presently vpon the beginning, or afterward. The subtlety likewise which may be herein vsed, is double: For sometimes they doe craftily induce them to a voluntary change of the Commonweale, and doe afterward continue it by violence, as at Athens in the time of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> foure hundred, they deceiued the people, promising them that the king of Persia would aid them in their war against the Lacedemonians, and by meanes of this lie they attempted to vsurpe the gouernment of the Commonweale. Sometimes they deceiue them at the first with faire words, &amp; keepe them afterward with their owne good wils, in such obedience and subiection as they wil the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, Commonweales are changed by force, or subtlety. By force, as the Romane Commonweale oppressed by Caesar, was changed into a Monarchy: the realm of Egipt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> into a Prouince by Augustus: and not long since, that of Hungary by the Turke: and the States of Florence and Si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> a Duchy. By subtletie, as that change which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened at Athens through Alcibiades meanes, mentioned in the text, whereof Iustine in his fift booke writeth thus: While the Athenians and Lacedemonians warred toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Alcibiades being banished from Athens, came to Tisfaphernes the King of Persia his lieutenant, who fauoured the Lacedemonians, to whom Alcibiades shewed that it were no good policie to minister ouergreat aid to the Lacedemonians (for their victorie would be nothing to his profite) but only to furnish them so far, that they might not for want of mony be enforced to giue ouer the war: For causing it by this meanes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> the king of Persia should haue in his choice both peace and warre, and subdue the Grecians with their owne forces, whom hee could neuer vanquish with all his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer. Whereas if the war should bee finished, they who had the victory, would forthwith set on him. That therefore it was necessary that Greece should bee weakened by ciuile dissentions, thereby to keep it from making war abroad; and that hee should so consider the power of both parts, as to aide alwaies the weaker side: for without doubt the Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians, if they got the victory, would not rest so, reputing themselues the preferuers &amp; protectors of the liberty of Greece. These speeches did greatly please Tissaphernes, who began to furnish the Lacedemonians very coldly with victuals and other necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> &amp; sent them not all the kings ships, because he would not giue them an absolute vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, but keepe them still in warre. Meanewhile Alcibiades aduertised the Athenians what he did for them. Whereupon they sent vnto him their embassadors, to whom hee promised that he would make the King of Persia their friend, if they would take away the authority from the people, and giue it to the Senate and Counsell: thinking that by this meanes, either the Cittie if it grewe to a generall agreement, would chuse

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> him captaine, or if it were diuided by sedition, that one of the parts would call him to their aid. But the Athenians seeing the danger whereinto this warre had broght them, had more care of their safety then of their honour, and gaue the whole authoritie of the people to the Senate and the publick Officers, who by reason of their natural pride, began to oppresse the rest: for euery one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would vsurpe Tyrannicall power ouer the people, as if he were their Lord. For which cause, the souldiers sent for Alcibiades recalling him from exile, and making him their cheefe commaunder by sea, who went forthwith towards Athens, and being landed, sent to the Gouernours and Senate, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them to restore the peoples authority, which if they refused to doe, he threatened <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to come vpon them with his souldiours, and enforce them thereunto. The Gouernours were herewith so terrified and astonished, that they resolued to betray the Citty to the Lacedemonians, but failing of their purpose, they went into voluntary banishment.</p>

Their cheefe meanes to attaine therevnto, was the trust which the people reposed in them, proceeding from the hatred they bare to the rich: as at Athens <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Pisistratus taking a quarrell against the Pediaci, and Theagenes at Megara hauing killed all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> the rich mens beasts, as he found them feeding neere the riuer; and Dionisius, by accusing Daph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus and the rich men, obtained the Tyranny for the grudge and enmity which he shewed to bear against them, and for that he was accounted one that held on the peoples side. Likewise, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocratie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> is changed from the auncient and accustomed into the last forme: For where the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates are chosen by the people without respect had to their reuenues, then these guides and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorites, of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we spake euen now, desirous to beare rule, bring the State to such a point, that they submit the lawes to the peoples will.

The second maner is, when the Magistrats are chosen by the people, without respect had to their wealth. For then these guides &amp; fauourites; desirous to beare rule, reduce the Democratie from a meane or middle form <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> wherein the Lawes haue greatest force, into an extreame kind, wherein all is done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the peoples pleasure, and by popular decrees, without any respect or regard of the Lawes.</p>

The people were very much moued at these wordes, which were presently spread abroad in the eares of all the common people, and especially of the men of warre. But for the present time euery man went home to his house in great heauinesse. The next day Dionisius assembled the people in counsaile, and openly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused the other Captaines his companions: And had attentiue audience, with great commendations at all the peoples hands, whome hee had greatly moued, so that at the last there was some one in the company who spake alowd, That it was needfull to chuse him alone Captaine generall, with full authority and soueraigne power: And that it was not exp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And as touching the Traitors, they would consider at more leasure what was to be done to them, but as then the time serued not: and that in ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At the hearing of these things, the people according to their custome, inclining sooner to euill then to good, made present choise of Dionisius for their Captaine generall, and gaue him full power, and soueraigne authority. Hereupon passing into the fields, and lodging in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> his tent, he fained one night that his enemies went about to kill him, and that they were come to assaile him in his tent, and so made a rumour and outcry by his friends and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, and withall fled into the Castell of the Leontines Towne, where hee passed the rest of the night, causing fires to bee made in all places, and sent for such men of warre as hee trusted best, as a man that had great cause to doubt of his safetie, and perceaued his life to be laid for by his enemies. The next day in the morning hauing assembled a certaine number of the Syracusans in this Citie of the Leontines, he declared in open assembly many fained matters, carrying some outward shew of truth, howbeit, tending only to induce the people to credite him; that his enemies came and assaulted him trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terously <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to kill him, and hee tolde his tale so cunningly, that the people by their decree graunted him a guard of sixe hundred persons of his owne nomination and choise. This brought he to passe by the example of Pisistratus the Athenian, who as the report goeth, wounded himselfe in many places of his bodie, and all bloody as he was, ran in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the market place, where, vpon the present assembly of the people, hee informed the audience, that his enemies and euill willers came and assaulted him, with intention to murder him, and had thus pitifully mangled him; vpon occasion whereof, the people granted him a guard of souldiours, by which meanes he vsurped Tyranny, and became lord of Athens. In like sort Dionisius by abusing the people of Siracusa by a like de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> established his tirannous dominion. Diodorus Siculus reporteth this in his 13. booke, chapter 29 and 30. Who also (speaking of Agathocles, that vsed the like craft and subtlety which Pisistratus and Dionisius did, for the abolishing of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocratie, and vsurping of the Monarchie) discourseth as followeth, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his nineteenth booke: It is an old Prouerbe (saith he) that the popular states are not destroyed and abolished by all manner of men, but by those that excell others in vertue; vpon which occasion, many Cities that liued in liberty, vpon suspition of their citizens that haue greatest power, vse their indeuors to restrain &amp; depresse their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; because they think the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuance of their authority &amp; preheminence, might easily <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> bring the state of the city into subiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; bondage.

For from the degree of a potter, hee came to so great authoritie and crueltie through whoredome and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, that hee brought into his subiection and bondage the largest and goodliest of all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> the Grecian Islands, as also for a time the greatest part of Libia, with certaine Countries of Italie, and filled all the Cities of Sicilie with murthers and outrages, for all they that were before him, came nothing neere him in cruelty and insolence, to auenge himselfe on some particular person, he would cause al his kindred to be slain; and for the offence of some few Cittizens, hee would put to death all the inhabitants of a Citty that were of age.

At another time being constrained by the Lacedemonians, they did absolutely submit themselues to thirty, and afterward to foure hundred. Sometimes the Senate, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the people had most authority there: to be short, there was not any durable form in that Commonweale. But from whence may we haue fuller and more certaine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the affaires of Athens, then from Thucidides, who was himselfe an Athenian, a man of great knowledge, experience, and authority, and the cheefest Grecian Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ographer; who writeth thus thereof in the eight booke of his Hystorie, the fourteenth chapter. The Athenians fell to debate, because the popular estate and gouernement of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> their Cittie had beene taken from the people, and giuen to a small number. For Pisan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and his fellowes being returned to Samos, wonne the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>mie that was there to their obedience, and a great part of the Samians exhorted the cheefe of the City to take the gouernment into their owne hands, although there were many others who sought to vphold and continue the popular Estate: from whence there arose great contention &amp; mutinies among them. The Athenians also who were in the army, hauing consulted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and seeing that Alcibiades liked not the matter, resolued to leaue him, and not to repeale the sentence of his banishment, because it seemed vnto them, that when hee should returne into the Citty, hee would not be a fit person to bee employed vnder the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> command of a small number, but that it was expedient, that they who were of the Estate, whereof there was question, should bethinke themselues how to handle and worke this matter, and neuerthelesse prosecute the warre, whereto each of them did rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily and willingly offer to contribute of his owne money, and whatsoeuer els was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, knowing that they laboured not any more for the publicke seruice of the state, nor for other men, but for themselues. So they sent Pisander, and the one halfe of the Embassadours that should haue gone to Tissaphernes, backe to Athens, to take order there for the eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They did farther de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, that Diatrephes who was then at the siege of Chio, should goe into the Prouince of Thrace, whereof he had ben appointed Gouernour; who at his departure from the said siege, passing by Thassus, abolished the popular estate, and put the gouernment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of a small number of Citizens: but when hee was gone from thence, the most part of the Thassians, hauing enclosed their City with a wall, about a moneth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his departure, persuaded themselues that they needed no longer bee gouerned by those whom the Athenians had placed in authority, and thereby to bee in their subiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> but to the contrary, hoping by the Lacedemonians aide to recouer within small time absolute liberty, because their fellow Citizens who had beene expulsed by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians, were gone to Lacedemon, where they made great sute that shippes might be sent to Thassus, and that the City might reuolt. Which thing fell out euen according to their owne desires, for the Cities former liberty was without danger restored, and the people which was bent against the authority and rule of a small number, was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out scandale depriued of the gouernment: but they who held with the Athenians, and whom Diotrephes had made Gouernours, found themselues greatly deceiued in the issue of their thoughts and expectations. The like was done in many other Cities sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> to the state of Athens, which considering (as it seemes to me) that they need no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to feare the Athenians, and that this manner of liuing in subiection to them, vnder the colour of gouernment, was nothing els in very deed than a disguised and shadowed kind of bondage, did all seeke for true libertie. Touching Pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and friendes had already done many things tending to the accomplishment of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> their purpose for the abolishing of the Popular estate. For one Androcles, who was in great authority and credite with the people, and had been one of the cheefe procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of Alcibiades banishment, was slaine through a priuie conspiracie of certain yong men of the City, for two causes; the one, because he had too great authoritie and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite with the people, the other, to get hereby the good will and fauour of Alcibiades, who as they thought should returne, and recouer his former authoritie, hoping that he would make Tissaphernes their friend, and for the same causes they had by like meanes slaine some others of whom they doubted: they had also besotted the people with arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall and smooth speeches, telling them that it was not meete to giue longer pay, saue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> only to those who serued in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Which thing did generally seeme honourable, and euen they who had caused the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing of the Popular estate, hoped by this change to haue authoritie. For as yet the ancient manner continues of assembling the people and the counsell for all causes, and of hearing all mens opinions, and following the greater part. But nothing might bee propounded without the deliberation of the little counsel, whereto this authority was assigned, in which there were some that conferred apart touching al those matters that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> were to bee propounded for the furtherance of their intent, and when they had deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their opinion, none durst contradict it for feare, seeing the great number and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the said Gouernours. For when any did gainesay them, they found meanes to make him away, not obseruing any forme of iustice, nor making inquisition touching murthers, wherewith the people were so amazed and terrified, that none of them durst speake a word, but thought that he sped well by holding his peace, if hee felt no further hurt nor violence: and their feare was by so much the more, because they doubted that there was a farre greater number in that conspiracie, neither had they any desire to know who they were, as well for the greatnesse of the City and people, as because no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> man knew anothers mind, nor durst complaine or reueale his secrets vnto him, or talke of meanes howe to bee auenged: for the feare and mutuall distrust was so great among them, that they stood in doubt euen of their acquaintance and verie friendes, fearing least they were of that conspiracie, because there were some thereof, of whome no man had euer anie such opinion. For which cause, they knewe not whome they might safely trust, so that the conspirators estate was greatly strengthened and assured, &amp; that cheefly by reason of the common diffidence. Pisander therefore and his fellowes being arriued in this trouble, did easily and in small time atchieue their purpose. And first of all hauing assembled the people, they caused them to consent to the election of tenne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> Clearkes and Secretaries, who might haue full authority and power to pronounce or read vnto the people whatsoeuer should vpon due aduise be thought meet to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted of for the good of the City, on a certaine day that was nominated. Which day being come, and the people assembled in a great fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And that whosoeuer did charge the relater or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porter thereof, that he had therein done against the lawes, or did otherwise outrage &amp; hinder him, should be greeuously punished. Then was the decree pronounced, the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> whereof was this, That all the Officers then being, who had receiued their charge and authoritie from the people, should be deposed, and that no stipend should bee allo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed vnto them; that there should be chosen fiue Presidents, who might afterward no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate an hundred persons, and each of them chuse three others, which should be in al foure hundred, who when thy sate in the Court, should haue full and ample authoritie and power to ordaine and execute whatsoeuer they should thinke good and profitable
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:7218:156"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> for the Commonweale, and besides, to summon and assemble fiue thousand Citizens so oft as should seeme good vnto them. This decree was pronounced by Pisander, who both therein and in all other things did willingly vndertake whatsoeuer hee thought serued to the abrogating and abolishing of the popular Estate. But the saied decree had been before precogitated and deuised by Antiphon, who was in great account and esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: For to speake the truth, not any man at that time in the whole City did surpasse him in vertue, he was withall very aduised and wise in giuing counsell touching publick affaires, and had besides an excellent grace in declaring and propounding them: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, hee neuer came to the common assemblies, nor to any other contentious <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> meeting, vnlesse he were sent for: but although he were thus warie, yet the people had him in suspition, for the efficacie and elegance of his speech: and albeit he led a priuate life, nor would not entermeddle in the Estate, yet euery one that had any cause or mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter either in iudgement or to the people, accounted it a great fauour if hee might haue Antiphons counsell. And after that this Tyrannicall Estate of the foure hundred was destroyed, and that they proceeded by forme of lawe against the principall Authours thereof, he being accused with the rest, did in mine opinion farre better defend and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere for himselfe then euer any man within the compasse of my remembrance. Phry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichus likewise shewed himselfe a great fauouror of this Estate, for feare of Alcibia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to whom he was well assured that all his practises were knowne, whereof he had se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly treated with Astiochus, being at Samos. But he thought that he would neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne during this gouernment of the foure hundred, for he was generally accounted a man both constant and valiant in extreame distresse and great aduersities, because the high courage of his mind was neuer knowne to faile in whatsoeuer danger. Therame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes also the sonne of Agnon, was a principall dealer in the abolishing of the Popular Estate, being a man of knowne sufficiency both in word and deed. It is therfore no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell that this enterprise which was plotted and prosecuted by so many men of wisdome and authority, had such successe; although it seemed and were indeed a matter of excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> difficulty to depriue the people of that liberty which they had enioyed and helde about an hundred yeares since the expulsion of the Tyran, and had not onely been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from subiection to anie, but had also for more then halfe the same time, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded other Countries. The assemblie of the people being broken vp, when they had approoued the said decree, the foure hundred were afterward brought into the Court in this manner: The Athenians were continually in armes by reason of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies that were at Decelea; to wit, some of them guarded the wals, some the gates, and other places, according as they were appointed. And when the day came that was as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed for the making of the act, they suffered all those who were not of the conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to goe home to their houses as the custome was, but the rest were commaunded to stay, not in the places wherein they were to watch, and where their weapons lay, but somewhat neere thereto; with charge, that if they saw anie offer to resist or hinder their purpose, they should if neede required, set vpon them. Now, they who were hereunto deputed and appointed, were the Andrians, the Thenians, with three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of the Caristians, and those of the Citie of AEgina, whome the Athenians had caused to come and dwell there.

<pb n="282" facs="tcp:7218:157"/>
stirre at all. Then the said foure hundred entring, chose out of their own number certain <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> Treasurers &amp; receiuers: which done, they offered a solemne sacrifice for the creation of the said new offices, &amp; hereby the forme of the Popular gouernment was wholly chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, &amp; a great part of things that had ben before decreed and done by the people, was reuoked &amp; cancelled, saue only the restoring of the banished men, least by vertue therof Alcibiades should returne. To proceed, these new gouernours did what they listed, and among other things they put to death certaine Citizens, doubting least they should be substituted in their places, because they seemed not agreeable to their Tyrannical hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours; some they imprisoned, others they banished. Hauing thus done, they sent an Herault to Agis king of Lacedemon, who was then at Decelea, signifying vnto him <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> that they were desirous to reconcile themselues to the Lacedemonians; and that hee might haue greater assurance, and repose more trust in them, then in a wauering and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constant multitude of ignorant people. But Agis thinking that the Citie must needes bee full of great discontent and trouble, and that the people would not so easily giue ouer their authoritie, especially if they should see a great armie come before the City, and supposing withall, that the Estate of the foure hundred, could not yet be so establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, but that it might be shaken; made them no answere touching the agreement that they desired, but within fewe daies after leuied a great number of souldiers in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of Peloponesus, whome togither with those that hee had alreadie at Decelea, hee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> brought to the very wals of Athens, hoping that the Athenians would yeeld the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues vnto him, as well in regard of their discontent and trouble both within &amp; without the Citie, as of their feare at the sight of so mightie a power, marching euen to their gates: and although his hope should therein faile him, yet seemed it likely that he might easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take the great wals by force, both because they were abandoned, &amp; by reason of their exceeding length, could not bee furnished with a sufficient number of defendants. But the euent was cleane contrarie to his expectation, for the Athenians raised no tumult at his approch, but sent out their horsemen, &amp; part of their footmen, both throughly &amp; lightly armed, who did forthwith driue backe those that came nearest to the wals, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> slew part of them, carrying their spoiles into the City. Then Agis seeing that his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise had not such issue as he expected, returned to Decelea, and within some fewe daies after, sent backe, and discharged the forraine souldiors whom he had leuied for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, keeping onely those whom he had before in pay. But the four hundred sent to him againe to treat of agreement, whereto he seemed in outward shew so far to incline, that he persuaded them to send Embassadours to Lacedemon for the treating of that peace which they desired. On the other side the said foure hundred, sent ten Citizens to them that were at Samos, who besides others things that they had in charge, were commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to declare vnto them that whatsoeuer had beene done in changing the Popular E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> tended not to the hurt of the Citie, but to the good and safetie therof; and that the authoritie was not in the hands of the foure hundred onely, but onely of fiue thousand; and that by this meanes the people did gouerne, as well then as before, sith during the Popular state there were neuer present in any assembly so great a number as fiue thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand persons at the deliberating and determining of whatsoeuer cause, whether dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall or forraine. And this embassage was sent to Samos by the four hundred, presently on the beginning of their vsurpation, because they feared that they of the fleet and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, would not allow this change, not obey their gouernement, but that the discord &amp; mischeefe arising there, would spread from thence into the city, as indeed it did. For <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> from the time that the said change was made at Athens, there was for the same cause a mutinie and sedition raised in the said City of Samos in this manner: Certain Samians, who in fauor of the Popular estate which was then in the City, and for defence thereof had risen in armes against the cheefe citizens, who would haue vsurped the gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, did afterward reuolt &amp; change their opinions, through the persuasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which Pisander at his comming thither, and other Athenians his sectaries &amp; complices had vsed vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Whereupon they purposing to ouerthrow the Popular Estate assembled themselues to the number of foure hundred or thereabout, fully resoluing to set vpon all those that maintained or fauoured that forme of gouernement, and pretending that they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented the whole body of the people. At the first brunt they slewe an Athenian named Hiperbolus, a wicked person, and of bad life, who had beene banished from Athens, not for any suspition or feare that they had of his power or authoritie, but for his foule of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, and because he dishonoured the City; they slewe also one of the Athenian Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, called Charminus, and certaine other Athenians who were in his company, by whose counsell hee was led. And they determined to proceede farther in fauour of this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> newe Oligarchie: but the other Citizens who held with the Popular Estate, hearing of this conspiracie, discouered it, namely to certaine of the captaines, who were vnder the charge of Diomedon and Leon, two Athenian commanders, who because they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceuied this charge and other honors of the people, were not content that the authority of the State should be in a few mens hands, &amp; therfore did in like sort reueale it to Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibulus and Thrasillu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This thing being thus declared to the cheefe persons and captains, they spake seuerally to the souldiers, persuading to hinder this conspiracie from taking effect. And first they vsed these speeches to that band or companie of the Athenians that was called Parali, and afterward to all the free men which were in that Athenianship; who both at that time and alwaies before, had shewed themselues vtter enemies to the rule of a small number, and had so good <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

These then ioining with those of the Citie who stood for the Poplar estate, discomfited the foure hundred conspirators that had risen in armes; of whom they slew thirty, &amp; banished three of the cheefest authours, pardoning the rest, and restoring from that time forward the same authoritie of gouernement to the Popular estate that it had before. This being done, the Samians and the Athenian souldiers that were there, sent that shippe of the Parali, as also the captaine and maister thereof, named Chereas the sonne of Archestrates, who had been verie forward in that action, to aduertise the Athenians howe all thinges had past at Samos, not knowing as yet that the gouernment of the City of Athens had ben committed to foure hundred: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> who being informed of the said shippes arriuall, caused two or three of the saied Parali to bee taken and imprisoned, and the rest they put into sundrie shippes, sending them into seuerall parts of Eubaea to be surely kept there, saue only Chereas, who hauing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood what they intended to doe, did hide and saue himselfe, returning with al speed possible to Samos, where he reported to the Athenian army, all that had been done at Athens, making euery thing greater then it was: for hee said that all they who held with the people were oppressed and outraged, not daring to speake one word against the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernors; and that they did not iniure &amp; outrage the men only, but their wiues and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren also.

But when they had beene told by some that sought to appease them, that by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so, they should put the Citie in daunger of falling into the enemies handes,

who were on the sea in great number, comming to assaile, they gaue ouer that bloodie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> resolution: yet purposing to restore openly the Popular Estate in that City, Thrasibu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus and Thrasillus who were the cheefe dealers herein, constrained all the Athenians in the armie, and euen those also that held with the gouernement of a fewe, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend to the vttermost of their power the Popular estate, and to followe in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe such order as those Captaines should giue, and withall to defend the said Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Samos against the Peloponesians, and to repute as enemies the foure hundred newe Gouernours, nor to make anie agreement with them. The like oath tooke all the Samians that were of age to beare armour, to whome also the souldiours sware, that they would liue and die with them in like fortune; assuring themselues that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> there was no other meanes of safetie, neither for them, nor the Samians, but that they were all cast away, if the Estate of the foure hundred should preuaile and continue at Athens, or if the Peloponesians should take the City of Samos by force. Herein was much time employed and spent, while the Athenian souldiours that were in the armie at Samos, sought to restore the Popular Estate at Athens, and they who had the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of Athens to constraine the Samians to doe as they had done. But the soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours being assembled for this cause, deposed all the Cap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>aines of the said armie, who were suspected to fauour the Estate of the foure hundred, and in their places they chose others, among who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were Thrasibulus and Thrasyllus, who exhorted the souldiours one <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> with another to be constant in that their resolution for sundry reasons that they shewed them, although the City had yeelded to the gouernement of the said foure hundred. And amongst other things they shewed them that they in the armie were farre more in number then they that remained in the City, and were better furnished with all things then they; because hauing in their hands the ships, and all the sea forces, they might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force the subiect and confederate Cities to contribute money. And although they should be vtterly excluded from Athens, yet had they the City of Samos, which was neither small nor weake: and besides, the City of Athens being thus depriued of power by sea, wherein it pretended to exceed all other Cities, they were strong inough to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> foile the Peloponesians if they came to assaile them at Samos, as they had done at other times, as also to resist those that were at Athens, and to preuaile against them, hauing the Shippes in their hands: by meanes whereof, they might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies bee stored with victuals, whereas the Athenians should feele great want thereof. For all the victuals that had vntill that time beene brought vnto them, and vnladen in the Hauen of Pyreum, came through the helpe and fauour of the armie at Samos, which would nowe barre them from the same, vnlesse they would restore vnto the people the gouernment of the City: and that by this meanes they of the said armie might better as it were shut vp the sea, and wholly depriue the vse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> thereof from tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For whatsoeuer that City could affoord or furnish of it selfe, was the least part of that which they were to hope for, thereby to resist the enemies; so that by losing that, they lost nothing: for the said Citie had no more money left, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the souldiours were enforced to serue on their owne charges: and the Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors had no good Counsell, which is the only thing whereby the City might keepe in obedience the armies that were abroad: but they had herein greatly failed, in that they had violated and corrupted their ancient lawes, which they at Samos would maintaine and enforce others to obserue them. Wherefore it was not a thing to be beleeued, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> such among them as had beene the authors of better counsell and opinion herein, then those of the City, should in other things be inferiour, and lesse aduised. And on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side, that if they would offer to Alcibiades his restitution and repeale from banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he would willingly make alliance and amity betweene them and the king of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia. But if these and all other things should faile them, yet they hauing so great an army by sea, might goe to whatsoeuer place they would to find Cities and lands wherein to

By such reasons and persuasions they exhorted each other, and notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vsed great diligence in preparing all things necessary for the war: which when the ten Embassadors, who had ben sent thither by the foure hundred, vnderstood to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished and spread abroad among the people, they kept silence, and declared not what they had in charge. And in the twelfth chapter of the same book he writeth thus: Mean<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>while the Embassadors whom the foure hundred had sent to S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Which words did greatly incourage many of the said foure hundred, who were already weary of that forme of gouernement, and would willingly haue giuen it ouer, if they had thought that they might haue done it without danger: so that al with one accord vndertook the ordering of these matters, hauing for their guides &amp; leaders therein, the two principall men &amp; of greatest power in the city, namely, The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramenes the son of Agnon, &amp; Aristocrates the son of Sicellius, and besides them, sundry other of the most notable persons that were among the foure hundred: who excused themselues touching the sending of Embassadours to the Lacedemonians, saying that they had done it for the fear that they had of Alcibiades and the others that were at Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to the end, the city might sustaine no harme; &amp; it seemed vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that they might keep the gouernment from comming into the hands of a small number, if they caused the fiue thousand who had ben nominated by the said four hundred to haue authority in very deed, &amp; not in word only, &amp; by this meanes they thonght that the Estate might be in other sort reformed to the good &amp; profit of the city: whereof although they alwaies made mention in all their assemblies &amp; consultations, yet the greatest part of them ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at their owne peculiar profite, &amp; did ambitiously thirst for authority, hoping that if the said gouernment of the four hundred were put down, they should not be not only equal to the rest, but also superior: And besides, in the popular estate euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> brooke a repulse, because the publick offices are giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the election of the people, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the estate or gouernment of particular persons, for he thought not that he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected by his equals, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is done by all the people. And to say the truth, the authority which Alcibiades had with those that were at Samos, did greatly encourage these men; who did withall perceiue, that the estate of the 400 could not long continue.

And this they did for the feare that they had, as well of those that were at Athens, as of those at Samos. And touching the wall that they repaired &amp; raised higher at Etiona, they did it not (as said Theramenes, &amp; they that held with him) so much to hinder the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who were at Samos fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> entring into the haue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Pyreum, as to receiue the enemies army by sea &amp; land whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they would: because Etio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na stands at the entrance of the haue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Pyreu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in maner of a cressant. Wherfore the wal that they built on the land side, did so strengthen the place, that they had it in their own

power by placing there a few men; either to permit the shippes that came, to enter, or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> keepe them out, because that place ioines to the other Tower that hath entrance very narrow. And besides those reparations which they bestowed at Etiona, they did likewise repaire the old wall that was without Pyreum on the sea side, and raised a new wall within on the land side: and betweene both they made great hals and storehouses, whether they enforced euery Cittizen to bring all his prouision of corne that hee had in his house: and likewise whatsoeuer corne was brought in by sea, was by their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement vnladen there, and they that wanted corne, were to buy it there. These things (namely, that the foure hundred made the said reparations and prouisions, to the end, to receiue the enemies) were spread abroad by Theramenes a good while before <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> the last Embassadours were sent by the foure hundred to Lacedemon, but after that they were returned, hauing done nothing in their said Embassage, Theremenes did speake more openly, that the wall which they had made should cause great daunger vnto the City. For at the same time came thither two and forty saile of the enemies, part where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of were Italians and Sicilians, who came from Peloponesus, to wit, those that were sent into Eubaea, and some of the rest were part of those who had beene left at the Hauen of Ye in the Countrey of Laconia, whose captaine was Agesandridas the sonne of Age<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sander a Lacedemonian. Whereupon Theramenes said that they fell not so much with that coast to prosecute their voyage of Eubaea, as to aid those that made the said wall at <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> Etiona; and that if good watch were not kept, it were greatly to bee feared that they would surprise Pyreum: and these speeches of Theramenes and of those that helde with him, were not altogether false nor spoken of malice. For in very truth, they that held the Oligarchie at Athens, would faine (if they might haue done it) gouerne the City with liberty, and vnder their authority haue power to commaund the subiects in the Cities name, as representing the body of the Commonweale: but if they could not maintaine and defend their authority, they had resolued, hauing the Hauen, the Ships, and the Fortresse of Pyreum in their hands, to liue in safety: because they feared, that if the people should <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For these causes they kept good watch on the wals and at the gates, and withall vsed great diligence in fortifying the places where the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies might enter, for they feared to be surprised and preuented: which enterprises and deliberations were made and communicated among few persons. But afterward Phry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichus being returned from Lacedemon, was hurt in the middest of the market place <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> by one of those that warded, whereof he died soone after, as he returned thence to the pallace, and he that had hurt him fled: but one Arginus who had assisted him, was by commandement of the foure hundred taken, and being demanded when he was on the rocke, who had persuaded him thereunto, he could name none, but said that he knew nothing, saue only that in the Captaine of the watch his house, as also in sundry other Citizens houses, there were oft great meetings.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the souldiours that were occupied about the fortification of Etiona, whose Captaine was Aristocrates, tooke one of the foure hundred, (that neuerthelesse secretly held of the contrary side) whose name was Alexicles, and committed him to ward in his owne house vnder the custody of a guard, and after apprehended many of them, and amongst others, one of the Captaines that had the keeping of Munichie, whose name was Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. And this was done by the consent of the greatest part of the Souldiours. Vpon the signifying of these things to the foure hundred, who then kept themselues within the pallace of the Towne, (except they whom the gouernment pleased not) they deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to put themselues in armes, and to set vpon Theramenes, and them that were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> with him. Who excusing himselfe, said he was ready to goe to Ye to apprehend them that made these innouations. And in deed he tooke with him one of the Captaines that was of his owne mind, and went to Pyrea, whom Aristarcus and the Horsemen aided, whereupon there rose forthwith a great and horrible tumult. For they that were within the city, said plainly &amp; openly, that Pyrea was taken, &amp; all they slain that were found in it: and on the other side, they that were within Pyrea, supposed that all they that were in the city came against the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: insomuch, that the ancients of the city had much ado to keep the citizens fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> putting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues in Arms. And herein Thucidides the Pharsalian took great pains with them, who hauing great friendship &amp; acquaintance with many of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> went to pacifie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with gentle speeches, requiring &amp; counselling the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that they should not put their City in danger of destruction, sith they had the enemies so neare at hand, who laie in wait for them. By which counsell the people were pacified, and euery man went home to his owne house. In the meane space Theramenes (who was one of the Gouernours) being arriued at Pyreum, made a shewe in words only, to bee angry with the footmen that were well armed. But Aristarcus, and they of his band, being of the contrarie faction, were indeed much offended with them. Who for all that ceased not to labour in their worke, so farre, that some of them asked Theramenes, whether hee thought it best to finish the wall, or plucke it downe. And when he answered them that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> he cared not if they plucked it downe, straightway all they that wrought, and manie of the rest that were in Pyreum, got vpon the wall, and in lesse then an houre laid it flat with the earth. And in the doing hereof, for the exhortating and winning of the people to their purpose, they spake thus alowd to the standers by: Whosoeuer had rather the fiue thousand should gouerne then the foure hundred, ought to yeeld his helpe to doe as we doe. And these speeches vsed they, because they would not haue it knowne that they meant to restore the Popular Estate, but rather they shewed themselues content and willing that the fiue thousand should gouerne: for they feared least some of them that pretended to haue some gouernment in the Popular Estate, would let some speech <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> thereof escape from him vnawares, as they talked one with another. Whereupon, the foure hundred were greatly amased, as being in no sort content, but vtterly disliking that the fiue thousand should haue the authority, yet meant they not that they should be deposed: For by so doing, the Popular state must needs come vp againe; and on the other side by giuing authority vnto them, it was in a manner all one, sith the power of the state should be in so many mens hands: and therefore this deuise of not declaring the thing, kept men in feare and suspition, as well on the one side, as on the other. The next day the foure hundred (notwithstanding, they were in great trouble) assembled in the pallace. On the other side, they that were in armes at Pyreum, hauing throwne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> downe the wall, and released Alexicles, whom they had before apprehended, went to the Theatre of Bacchus, which is before Munichium within the hauen of Pyreum: There held they their counsell, and hauing throughly debated euery point, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to go to the City, and there to set vp their armour in the accustomed place. This accomplished they, and vpon their vnarmings came many Citizens sent secretly from the foure hundred, who addressed themselues to those among them whom they knew to bee most tractable, praying them to demeane themselues peaceably, and make no
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:7218:160"/>
trouble or tumult in the City, and also to keepe others from it, telling them that they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> might name altogether the fiue thousand that ought to haue the gouernment, and put in this number the foure hundred, with such Office and authoritie as they thought meete, to the intent, that the Citie might not be put in daunger of falling into the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies hands. By these aduertisements and requests that were made by sundrie men in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse places, and to seuerall personages, the people that were in armour, were well paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, fearing least their controuersie would turne to the destruction of the City: inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that it was agreed vpon by all men, that a generall assembly should at a certaine day be held in the Temple of Bacchus. And in the thirteenth chapter of the same b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ok he writeth thus: The Athenians vpon the vnderstanding of these newes, in what feare <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> and necessity soeuer they were, armed notwithstanding twentie shippes, and presently assembled in the same place of Pyreum, and then in a place that they call Pycue, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they had other times accustomed to assemble. In these assemblies it was concluded, that the foure hundred should be deposed, and that the authority should remaine in the hands of the fiue thousand, of the which number all they might bee that could bear ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and that would serue in Offices without wages. And whosoeuer should do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, should be accursed. Many other assemblies followed after, where in diuerse lawes and ordinances were made touching the gouernment of the Gommonweale, &amp; at this beginning in mine opinion they effectually performed many thinges for the direction <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> of common affaires to the welfare of the city, by reducing the controuersie, that by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of the Popular and particular gouernment was amongst them, to a good Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocritie: which caused both the surceassing of many naughty things that were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted in the city, &amp; also of the maintenance of the said city &amp; commonweale. Thus you may see what Thucidides hath truly &amp; grauely written concerning the troubles and altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Athens, which I thought good to insert in this place, though it were somewhat long, as well to giue the reader a greater light for the vnderstanding of Aristotles obseruations, which of themselues be short &amp; darke; as to shew the vse of the skil of gouernment, specially by so excellent an Historiographer, &amp; in a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> the glory and renowme whereof of is spred through the whole world; to the inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t also that the readers by considering the truth of old thinges, may thereby iudge those things to be such like, that now are, &amp; hereafter shall be.

                  <p>THerfore wheras in laying of the foundation of the popular authority at Florence at the beginning, those mixtures and temperatures were not vsed therein, that should warrant and settle their liberty; with gentle and reasonable meanes, and keepe the gouernment from falling into disorder through the ignorance and licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse of the multitude: The Commonweale hath alwaies been full of confusion, &amp; out of order, because on the one side the citizens of greatest calling, thought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> lesse esteemed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they supposed was meet, &amp; on the other side, their ambition was sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to the people, &amp; withal because diuers came ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to counsels of importance that were very vnfit for it, &amp; for that the soueraigne Magistrate, vnto whom the cheefe and hardest matters were referred, was changed euery two months. When the Noblemen intruded themselues into the authoritie of Gouernement, the people by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son they could not endure their great pride, did soone take armes against them,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:7218:160"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and tooke the gouernment out of their hands, which they made altogether Popular, so that sometimes, in such a broile, a wollecarder, wearing the cognisance of iustice, was created Confalonier and Prince of the City: So great was the hatred betweene the people and the nobilitie, that that part which got the victorie, did alwaies thrust the other that was ouercome out of the gouernment, with ransacking, burning, banishing, and murders, and made lawes and iudgements for their owne aduantage, not regarding the publicke benefite of the state. In the assemblies of the City, they were most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly one against another, and made it no matter of conscience to hinder the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweale, to the intent, to gainesay or resist their aduersaries. And the people did not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> resist the Nobility only, but also the Popular sort were deuided from the commoners. They called the Noblemen by an odious name, Mightie fellowes: and had deuided the people into two orders, placing in the one the rich men that might attaine to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracies; and in the other, the poore, that exercised base occupations and were exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the gouernment. The distributing of the people, consisted of two and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie companies of occupations, whereof seuen were called the greater, and might bee admitted to the gouernment, as being the most honest and worshipfull: the other fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene stood for a ciphre in the publicke gouernment, who notwithstanding for that they were the greatest number, &amp; sorrie to see themselues depriued of honour, attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> oft to obtaine that by force of armes, which was denied vnto them by the lawes and statutes of the Commonweale. And ioining themselues with the Popular sort, as nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest to their order, were for the most part superiours and maisters in the creation and election of the publicke offices, whereto they aduanced their partakers, and thrust out the Noblemen, many of whom to attaine thereunto, put themselues in the rancke of the Popular sort, changing the armes and titles of their families. By meanes whereof, the citie was deuided into Neri, and Bianchi, and into Guelphes, and Gibelines. There was a congregation called the Parliament, that was held by all the Citizens in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket place before the Townehouse, where euery man consulted of those matters that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the cheefe Magistrate propounded. In this Parliament there was established a kinde of gouernment, that vnder the name of popular gouernement, tended more to the power of a few persons, then of all men in generall. And though there came not anie great number of Citizens to the same, yet the aduise and counsell that enclined to a forme of gouernment not so large and Popular; had taken effect, had it not beene for Frier Ierome Sauonarola, a Iacobite, who hauing gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the name &amp; authority of a Prophet, openly detested and found fault with that forme of deliberating in the parliament; and affirmed that it was the will of God that there should be ordained a gouernement alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gethes Popular, so as it should not rest in the power of a few Citizens to change the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and safetie of others. Therefore when the matter had been often debated, it was at last determined, that a counsell should be created of all the Citizens, whereinto the scumme of the people should not be receiued, but onely they that by the ancient lawes of the City, might be admitted to the gouernment. In which counsell nothing should bee treated off or disposed, sauing the election of all the Magistrates for the City, and the possessions and reuenues, and the confirmation and prouision of money, and all lawes aforetime ordained by the Magistrates, and other straighter counsels. Nowe, as consultation was had one day about the forme of the said gouernement betweene the cheefe Magistrates and persons of greatest reputation, two contrary Orations were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> made, the one by Paule Anthony Soderin, who spake for the Democratie; the other by Guy Anthonie Vespucci, who vpheld the Oligarchie: which because they are most fit for the vnderstanding of the present matter, shall bee here set downe. Therefore Paule Anthonie Soderin began in this maner: Although the Popular state be lesse esteemed then that wherein all matters bee referred to one alone, or gouerned according to the aduise of vpright and honest men, yet notwithstanding for that the desire of libertie is an auncient thing, and welneere naturall in this City, and for that the condition of our
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:7218:161"/>
Citizens is proportioned to equalitie, which is a verie necessary foundation of popular <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> gouernments, I could easily shew, that without any manner of doubt, we ought to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre it before al others, were it not that such kind of disputation should be superfluous, forasmuch as in all the latter assemblies it hath alwaies ben determined by general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent that the Citie should be gouerned in the name, and by the authority of the people. But hence came the diuersitie of opinions, that some in the matters ordained by the parliament haue voluntarily condiscended to that forme of Commonweale, whereby this Citie was gouerned, before the libertie of the same was oppressed by the house of Medici. And others (of whose number I confesse my selfe to bee one) by reason they iudge that kind of gouernment thus ordained to containe in many matters, rather the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> name then the effect of a Popular gouernment, and are afeard by knowing the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents which haue often growne of such kinds of gouernement, doe desire a perfecter forme, whereby the concord and safetie of the Citizens may be preserued: a thing that cannot be hoped for in this Citie by anie reason or experience of the time past, except it be vnder a gouernment, wholly depending on the peoples authority, so that it be wel and duly ordained and ruled, which cheefely is grounded on two foundations: The first whereof is, that all the Magistracies and Offices as well in the Citie, as in all the territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, be giuen for a certaine time, by an vniuersal counsell of all them that by our lawes may be gouernours: without the allowance of which counsell, it shall not be lawfull to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> make new lawes. By meanes hereof, when it shall not rest in the power of priuate Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, nor of any particular conspiracie or confederacie to distribute the dignities and authorities, no man shall bee barred from the same for another mans fancie, but they shall be distributed according to mens vertues and deserts: &amp; therfore euery man must endeuour to prepare his way to honour with vertues and good manners, by aiding the publicke state, and all men priuately. It shall then be necessary for euery man to abstaine from vice, from hurting other men, and finally from all things that be hatefull in a well ordered citie. Neither shall it lie in the power of one or a few, to bring in any other go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, by new lawes, or by the authoritie of a Magistrate, when as this gouernment <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> cannot be altered without the consent of an vniuersall counsel. The second foundation is, that consultations and determinations touching matters of importance, namely, those that concerne peace and warres, the examining of newe lawes, and generally all things necessarie for the gouernment of such a Citie and dominion as this is, be orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and directed by Magistrates, especially authorised to that charge and office, and by a priu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>er counsell of wise and experienced Citizens that shall be appointed by the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of the people, because euery man is not fit for the hearing and determining of those matters, but they that are capable of the same ought to haue the gouerning thereof; and sith they often require diligence or secrecie, they may not be consulted of, nor determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> with the multitude<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> For it is not necessary for the preseruation of libertie, that such matters should be treated of in a verie great companie, it being sufficient for the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Cities libertie, that the distributing of the Magistracies, and the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of newe lawes depend on vniuersal consent. When these matters be prouided for, the gouernment which is perfectly Popular, remaineth ordained; the libertie of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie founded, and a commendable and durable forme of Commonweale confirmed. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse other matters to the bettering of this gouernment (whereof wee speake) shall bee reserued for a fitter time, because at this beginning we will not trouble the minds of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who are suspitious and doubtfull, through remembrance of the Tyrannie past, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> they are not acquainted with the ordering of free gouernments, cannot perfectly perceiue what is necessarie to be ordained for the preseruation of libertie: which mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters because they are not of so great importance, may without danger be referred till a a fitter time and better occasion. Our Citizens will daily grow more in liking with this forme of gouernment, and when through practise they are become more capable, they wil be desirous continually to amend, and bring it to full perfection which in the mean
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:7218:161"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> time shalbe vpheld by the ij. foundations before mentioned, which are easie to be ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, by shewing the fruits that wil come therof, not only by reasons, but also by exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples. For though the gouernment of the Venetians belong to the gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet are they but priuat citizens, in such number, &amp; of so diuerse degrees, that it cannot be denied, but it contains a great part of the Popular gouernment, &amp; cannot be imitated in many things. Notwithstanding, it is cheefly laid on these ij. foundations, on the which the same Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweale leaning &amp; staying, hath by the space of so many ages, maintained her liberty with vnity and ciuile concord, and is mounted to such glory &amp; high estate. This vnity of the Venetians hath not proceeded fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the scituation of their city (as many men suppose) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> because there may be; &amp; haue ben sometimes discords amongst the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; but rather fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a form of gouernment, so wel ordained and proportioned to it selfe, that of necessitie it yeelds so excellent and wonderful effects. For we must consider to the contrary, that by reason our Citie had neuer a like forme of gouernment, therefore our affaires haue euermore been subiect to ordinarie alterations, being one while as it were oppressed by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of Tyrans, another while rent asunder through the ambitious and couetous dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of certaine persons, and as quickly broken in peeces through the vnbridled licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiousnesse of the Comminaltie: and whereas Cities were builded for the tranquilitie and happie life of the inhabitants; the confiscations of our lands and goods, the banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and beheadings of our vnhappie Citizens, haue beene the hap and tranquilitie that we haue had. The gouernment brought in by the Parliament, doth not differ from those kinds of gouernment, which at other times haue ben in this Citie, that haue ben full of discords and calamities, and after endlesse broiles both publicke and priuat, haue at last engendred Tyrannies. For the Duke of Athens in the time of our ancestors, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed not the libertie for any other occasion, nor Cosmus de Medici in the times fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, whereat we need not to meruel. For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bestowing of the Magistracies, &amp; the determining of laws need not the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon consent, but depend on the will of the les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>er number, then the citizens being intentiue &amp; careful, not of the common welfare, but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of their priuat desires &amp; purposes, do follow particular factions &amp; conspiracies: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the diuisions of al cities are ioined, being the most certain pestilence &amp; death of al co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monweales &amp; empires: how much more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> standeth it with wisdome, to shun these formes of gouernment, which both by reasons and others examples, we may know to be pernicious &amp; dangerous; &amp; to take those forms that be behoofeful &amp; happy? For this speech wil I freely vtter, that the gouernment alwaies ordained in our city in such sort, that a few Citizens therein haue vnmeasurable authority, is a gouernment of a few Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans, who are so much the more dangerous then one Tyran alone, as the euil is so much the worse, by how much the more it is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted &amp; multiplied. And though there were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> no other inconuenience in it, yet at least, by reason of the diuersity of opinions, of ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; variable desires of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, no long agreement could therein be hoped for. And dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, which at al times is most dangerous, should at this time be more perillous, wherin you haue sent so mighty a lord into exile, wherein you are depriued of a good part of your state, &amp; wherin Italy hauing strange armies within her bowels, is fully laid open to most great dangers. Very sildome, yea it may be neuer, hath it laine absolutely in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the whole city to take order for it self, according to hir own good pleasure: Now therfore sith the benignity and goodnesse of God hath deliuered that power into your hands, lose not you the oportunity of founding a free gouernement, and so well ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> that not only during your own liues, it may make you happy, but also that you may promise the euerlasting continuance of the same, &amp; so leaue for an inheritance to your childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; successors such a treasure &amp; felicity, as neither your selues nor your ancestors euer had or knew. These were the speeches of Paule Anthonie. But to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary, Guy Anthonie Vespucci spake thus, If the gouernement established in that forme which Paule Anthonie Soderin hath propounded, would so easily bring forth the desir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="292" facs="tcp:7218:162"/>
our countrey would wish for any other gouernment: and he should be a very bad Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> that would not be greatly in loue with a forme of Commonweale, wherein mens vertues, deserts, and valour, should aboue all other things bee respected and honoured. Howbeit, I see not how wee may hope that a gouernement resting wholly in the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples power, should be fraught with so manie commodities. For this knowe I well, that reason teacheth, experience proueth, and the authoritie of great men confirmeth, that in so great a multitude, there is not such wisedome, such experience, nor such order to be found, as that the wise should be preferred before the ignorant; the good before the bad; and men of experience before them that neuer had the gouernement of anie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires: For as vpright iudgements cannot bee hoped for at the hands of an vnfit and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> iudge, euen so should there not any wise or reasonable election or determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be hoped for at the hands of a people that is full of disorder and ignorance. And, what wise men can scantly descerne, which spend their time about nothing else; shall wee beleeue that a multitude being rude, ignorant, consisting of so great diuersities of minds, conditions, and manners, and wholly regarding that which concerneth it selfe particularly, can distinguish and perceiue it? I omit to speake of the immoderate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasion that euerie one will haue of himselfe, which will cause in all men a greedie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of honour. Neither will it suffice men in a popular gouernement to enioy the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest fruits of libertie, but they will all aspire to the principall degrees, and haue place in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> deliberations of most important and hard matters. For the modestie of giuing place to the skilfullest and best deseruing persons reigneth lesse in this Citie then in any other. And so entring into this persuasion that of right we ought all to be equall in all things, the rowmes of vertue and valour, being in the power of the multitude, shall bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded. And this greedie desire extending to the most part, will bee an occasion, that they who knowe least, or least deserue it, shall bee able to doe most; for by reason they are the greatest number, they wil haue the most power in the state where opinions shal be accounted, and not weighed. This being considered, what warrant or assurance can you haue, that they holding themselues content with such a forme, which you would <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> haue now ordained, will not straightway fall to the troubling of that state of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweale, which hath beene wisely brought in; by new inuentions, and imprudent lawes, which wise men shall not be able to withstand? Which things being at all times dangerous in such a kind of Commonweale, are more to be feared at this present, sith the nature of men is such, that when they passe from one extremitie, wherein they haue been forcibly kept, they leape wilfully into another, without staying in a meane. So hee that commeth out of Tyrannie, vnlesse he be held backe, falleth headlong into all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of excessiue licentiousnesse, which may also iustly be called Tyrannie. For the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are like vnto a Tyran, when they giue to him that deserueth not, take from him that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> deserueth, and confound the degrees and differences of persons. And it may bee, that the Tyrannie thereof is more hurtful, then the ignorance daungerous; forasmuch as it hath neither weight, measure, nor law, but disordered naughtinesse. Neither ought the example of the Venetians to moue vs: For the scituation of their Citie worketh some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in their behalfe, the forme of gouernment receiued there a great while since, may doe much; &amp; matters there are so ordained, that deliberations of importance, are more in the hands of a few then of manie; and their wits peraduenture being not naturally so fine and subtile as ours, they are more easily contented. And yet the Venetian gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment standeth not onely vpon those two foundations that haue beene alledged, but it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> greatly auaileth to the perfection and stabilitie thereof, that there is euermore a Duke, together with diuerse other ordinances; which whosoeuer intended to bring into this Commonweale, should find many gainsayers, by reason our Citie dooth not at this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, take her being nor her institution and establishment with lawes. And therefore old customes, oft contrary to the common welfare, and men suspecting that vnder co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of the preseruation of libertie, a new Tyranny would be raised, do not giue place

For these reasons, and for as much as worldly matters commonly waxe worse and worse, it is more to bee feared, that whatsoeuer shall at this beginning bee vnperfectly ordained, will in time grow to vtter disorder, then to be hoped, that with time or oportunity it should be brought to perfection. But what need we seeke for examples abroad, sith we haue sufficient at home?

And if we will seeke for examples in other places, why remember wee not that the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> in all respects Popular, was the occasion of so many tumults in Rome, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch, that had it not been for martiall skill and diligence, the life of the same Commonweale had been short? Why call not we to remembrance, that Athens a most flourishing and most mighty City, lost her Empire, and then fell into the bondage of her owne Citizens and of strangers, for no other cause, but for that the greatest affaires there were ordained by the consultation and determination of the Communaltie? I see not vpon what occasion it may bee affirmed, that in the forme which the Parliament hath inuented, there is not perfect libertie to bee found; sith euerie matter is referred to the disposition of the Magistrates, who <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> remaine not in Office continuallie, but are chaunged; neither are they chosen by a fewe, but allowed and confirmed by a great mainie; neither by the olde cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of the Cittie ought they to bee put againe to lotting: Howe then can they bee distributed by practises, or according to the fantasies of particular Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens? Wee shall haue a farre greater warrant of our safetie, when the most weightie affaires shall bee vnder the examination and direction of the wisest men, and of them that bee of best experience, and the grauest, who will gouerne the same after another order, with another manner of secresie, and with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fashion of iudgement then the people would doe; who are vnfit for such <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> matters, and sometimes are verie liberall in spending, when no neede requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, and other whiles in time of neede so sparing and niggardlie, that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes for the sauing of a small charge, they fall afterwards into verie great expences and daungers. Nowe euen as Paule Anthonie Soderin hath affirmed, most great and most important is the weakenesse of Italie, and speciallie of our owne Countrey. Therefore what want of wisedome should it bee, in such a time as the skilfullest and best experienced Phisitions are needefull, to commit our selues into the hands of them that haue least skill and experience?

                  <p>Nowe, as concerning the house of Medici,<note place="margin">The house of Medici.</note> mentioned in these former Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, it obtained at Florence (vnder the name and shewe of a Gouenement, well neere Cittie-like) verie great power and authoritie for the space of three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> yeares together, beginning at the sayed Cosmus de Medici, a Cittizen of singular wisedome, and wonderfull richesse, and for those respects hee was greatlie renowmed, and was had in great reputation in all parts of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope. Peter succeeeded Cosmus, and after Peter succeeded Lawrence, a man of great wit and excellent counsell, no lesse noble and valiant then his grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, howbeit, vsing more absolute authoritie in the gouernment of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale, yet gently and friendly, and such as was needfull in a towne of liberty, as Philip

de Comines sayth, He tooke twentie men for the guard of his person, by the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> and license of the Senate, which commanded what he listed. Notwithstanding, he gouerned moderately in this high authority, and was one of the wisest men of his time, and in great reputation through all Italie, and with many forraine Princes. But the other Peter his yong and vnwise sonne supposing the same authority to be due vnto him of right, vndertooke to gouerne like a lord, making himselfe fearfull to other men by meanes of that guard, by committing many violences, frayes, and lauishly spending the common treasure: Whereby hee fell into the hatred of the Citizens, and was bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed by the Senate, with Iohn the Cardinall, and Iulian, his brethren. And when hee had fled and abandoned that high estate, the people in a tumult put themselues in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> and spoiled all the moueables of his house, which were worth aboue a hundred thousand crownes. This befell in the time of king Charles the eight his passage, when he went to Naples. Afterwards, when this Cardinall Iohn was chosen Pope, and called Leo the tenth, he caused the proclamation and sentence of banishment to be repealed, and restored the house of Medici to the former highnesse, authority, and reputation. Howbeit, the Florentines recouering their libertie, set vp the Popular gouernement againe, and after the taking of Rome, and the captiuity of Pope Clement, defaced and pulled down in all places of the Citie the armes of the house of Medici, specially those that were fixed on the publicke buildings which they had erected, brake downe the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> Images of Leo and Clement that stond in the temple of the Annuntiation, made sale of the Popes goods, and employed them in paying the debts of the Commonweale. By which doings they so angred the Pope, that hee stirred vp the forces of the Emperour Charles against them, and after a long siege subdued them, and made them yeelde to such conditions as liked himselfe: obtaining not onely the returne of the Medici, but also causing the Commonweale to bee chaunged into a Dukedome, and that to bee for euer possessed by them. The first Duke was Alexander the Popes nephew, and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours sonne in lawe, who was slaine by Lawrence his owne neere kinsman. In whose place succeeded Cosmus, who for a long time gouerned this estate, ioining Sienna to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> it, and after yeelded it vp to his eldest sonne, for the better setling of him therein before his owne death: as is reported by Guichardine in his first, second, third, sixteenth, nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth, and twentieth books, Paulus Iouius in his first, fiue &amp; twentieth, seuen &amp; twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth, eight and twentieth, nine and twentieth, and eight and thirtieth books.

F. Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chardine in his 7. and 10. bookes, rehearseth a new kind of gouernment, brought vp at Genoa vnder the name of libertie, the summe whereof was thus, That by a counsell of foure hundred Citizens all the Magistracies and dignities of their Cittie, and cheefely <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the Duke and the soueraigne Magistrate should bee created for the space of two yeares: and the law abrogated, whereby the Gentlemen were afore barred from them. And for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as it was a most expedient foundation for the preseruation of libertie, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy should be prouided for the appeasing of the Citizens dissensions, which had ben for a long space greater and more dangerous there then in any other City of Italie, the names of all the families were put downe, and only eight and twenty of the same Citie kept still, and the most famous and most notable families retained they, sauing those of the Adorni and Fregosi, which were fully extinguished, vnder the name and number of which families, they assembled all these gentlemen, and the people remained namelesse. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> And the more to confound the memory of the factions, they put the families of the Gentlemen with the families of the people, and those of the people with the families of the Gentlemen, and those houses which had ben partakers with the Adoni, into the houses which had followed the Fregosi, and so contrariwise, some of the Fregosi into the houses that had followed the Adorni. And a law was made, that there should bee no difference betweene them, that might bee a greater impediment to the one then to the other for the attainement of the honours and Magistracies: by which mingling of men and names together, their hope was, that in short time the pestiferous remembrance of factions, would bee cleerely extinguished.

Many old Commonweales haue passed it in greatnesse of Empire, in chiualrie, and in renowne of haughtie enterprises, but there can none of them bee compared vnto it in goodnesse of gouernement and lawes, to liue well and happily; neither can any bee found that hath so long reigned.

Notwithstanding, as in worldly thinges there is none so perfect, but there is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in it blameworthie, so bee there some imperfections in this state, which often haue beene the cause of casting it into great toile and daunger. First of all,<note place="margin">The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of Venice.</note> the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen that there haue the whole dominion, hauing vtterly excluded the people from the gouernment, doe diuide amongst themselues all charges and offices, or the most part of them, wherein there is either honour or profite, whereat the other Citizens,

Neither haue the same cheefe Citizens anie hope of obtaining any office or benefice of importance: For there hee not halfe ynow for the Lords. Another inconuenience is there in the same Estate, and that no small one, namely, that for feare least anie amongst them should attempt to vsurpe the dominion of the state, if <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> hee were in credite and authority with the people and souldiours, they serue not their turne with any generall or particular Captaine of their owne Nation, specially in their armies by land, but giue the charge of their armie most often to strangers: Therefore when their Captaines, and a great part of their souldiours bee strangers, they beare not that affection and zeale to the state and Commonweale, which they doe that are members thereof. And although they ioine in commission with the generals and cheef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of the warre, certaine assistants whom they call Proueditors, without whome the said cheefetaines can neither execute nor determine any thing of importance, euen in those matters that concerne the warre, yet is not this a sufficient remedie: for sith those <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> Proueditors are no warriors, they may easily commit great errors; and the Cheefetains seeing themselues subiect to such persons, and constrained to obey them in that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they haue no knowledge nor vnderstanding, do verie oft conceaue great indignation thereat, and serue not with such good will and forwardnesse as they would if they had the whole authority: sometimes also they are content to see those things haue bad suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse which are done against their minds, after the pleasures and humors of the said Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueditors, as wee may finde that it hath oftentimes happened. There is also betweene the said Gentleman and Lords great partiality, namely betweene those who are descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the ancient founders of that Citie, and those who since in processe of time <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> haue ben created; who are now more in number then those of the ancient houses: For either of these said factions seekes to haue cheefe authority, as well in gouerning the Commonweale, as in offices, and in other honours and profites; whereby it oft happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, that in matters concerning the Estate, they doe dissent, and as it were seuerally band themselues in taking parts, regarding more their particular passions, then the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke good of the Signorie; to which passions, they are subiect as well as other men.

                  <hi>OLigarchies are changed in two most plaine and euident manners: The one is, if the Gouernours doe vniustly oppresse the common people; For then the first that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> caused by the rich men, and that in many sorts. For sometimes the Oligarchie is destroied by the rich men who do not participate in the gouernment, especially when the number of those that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uern is very small, as it happened at Marsilia, Istrum, and Heraclea, and in other cities, where <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> they who were not admitted to the Magistracies, did neuer cease from mutining, vntil they had changed the forme of the Estate, and made it lawfull first that the eldest brethren, and then the yonger might be admitted to the authority of gouernment. Certes, in some places the father and the sonne, and in others, the elder and yonger brethren cannot beare office together, but that is where the Oligarchie is more ciuilly ordained. At Istrum it became in the end a Democratie. At Heraclea from a smaller number, it rose to sixe hundred: and at Gnidus the Oligarchie was changed through the dissension which grew betweene the noblemen, because few persons were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the gouernment of the Commonweale: and (as it hath beene said) if the father gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the son was by that meanes excluded; and if there were many brethren, the eldest only was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> thereto admitted. So that the people rising likewise by reason of their discord, and chusing one of the Noblemen for their head and leader, assailed the rest and ouercame them, for euery factious cause is weake. And long since at Erythrae, during the Oligarchie of the Basilidae, although other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they demeaned themselues well, yet the people disliking to be subiect to a few persons, changed the forme of the gouernment. Oligarchies are likewise changed of themselues through the facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of those that lead and flatter the people, and that in two sorts: The one, when there is a flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer among the Oligarchicall persons themselues, although they bee very few in number: as at A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> in the time of the thirty Tyrans, Chares got himselfe power by flattering them, and Phry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichus after the same sort, in the time of the foure hundred. The other is, when the lords who are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of the Oligarchie doe flatter the people; as at Larissa they who were called the Cities guard, flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the people, because they were chosen by them: as also it happens in all the Oligarchies, wherein the Magistrats are not chosen by the gouernors, but are thereto aduanced for their large reuenues, or by companies, &amp; chosen by the souldiors or the people: as it came to passe at Abidus. In like sort, where the administration of iustice is not executed by those that gouern: for then the iudges seeke to please the people, that they may thereby obtain the soueraigne authority of iudgement, and they change the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monweale, as it happened at Heraclea neere the sea of Pontus.

                     </gap>ause they are constrained to vse them in their warres. And changes happen in time of peace, when for the doubt and suspition that one hath of another, they commit the guard &amp; kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the citie to forraine souldiors, or to some captaine that is a Neuter, who doe sometimes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come lords of two parts, as it happened at Larissa during the rule of the Aleuadians who were of Samos; and at Abidus during the factions, whereof one was the faction of Iphiadus. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> seditions arise through the mutuall offences which the Oligarchical persons do offer among themselues, persecuting each other for causes of mariages, or sentences of iudgement: of mariages, as may appeare by the examples before alledged; and Diagoras likewise being offended about a mariage, subuerted the Eretrian Oligarchie, which was held by the Horsemen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> For causes of iudgement, as the sedition which was raised at Heraclea for a sentence giuen in iudgement; and at Thebes, by reason of adultery, where they did iustly proceed to the punishment of the crime committed, but seditiously and scandalously, as well they of Heraclea against Eurytion, as they of Thebes against Archius, whome their enmies bare so great hatred, that they caused them to bee bound by the neckes to the pillory with chaines of yron. Likewise many Oligarchies are destroied <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> because they are too imperious, and that by some who haue part in the same gouernment, and are offended with the insolence vsed by the rest: as the Oligarchie of Gnidus, and that of Chio. There doe yet further happen changes, as well in the Comonweale so generally called, as in Oligarchies, where<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>he counsellors of Estates, the iudges and other officers are chosen for their reuenues: For it doth oft come to passe, that the proportion of reuenues, which is at the first ordained, to the end that few men in the Oligarchies, and men of meane substance in the Commonweale, may attaine to publicke offices, is for a time obserued; but if through the prosperitie, caused by peace or by anie other meanes the same possessions amount to a greater value, then all the Citizens become capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of al dignities, which change doth happen sometimes by little and little and secretly, &amp; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> sooner. Such are the causes whereby Oligarchies are changed and trouble with seditions. Likewise, both Democraties and Oligarchies are sometimes changed not into contrary formes of Commonweales, but also into others of the same kind: as the lawfull Democraties &amp; Oligarchies into those that vse absolute power, and they againe into those that are lawfull.</hi>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> whole authoritie and iurisdiction of all matters: These thirtie Gouernors were by their general name, Reformers, but in effect plaine Tyrans. They were to ordaine a Senat, and the other officers of the Commonweale, and besides to make lawes and statutes, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to which, the said officers should iudge and order themselues in their seueral char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. And touching the lawes and statutes which they were to establish, they vsed conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall delaies, wanting thereto no colours of vaine occasions. And meane while they chose a Senate and the other officers out of their owne friends and sectaries, who had the name of Senators and Magistrates, but were in very deed ministers of these thirtie Tyrans wickednesse: yet at the beginning, they condemned in open iudgement, &amp; put <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to death some of the most notable caitifes that were in the Citie, so that for that time euen the better sort liked well their gouernment. But eftsoones seeking by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to doe things by force that were vniust, they sent to the Lacedemonians to demand of them a guard for the suretie of their persons, promising them to establish in Athens such a gouernment, as should tend greatly to their profite: which guard when they had obtained, they apprehended a great number of the wealthiest Citizens, such as they thought to be the fittest prey for them, whom they put al to death, and confiscated their goods, hauing falsely charged them that they had attempted and conspired some inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. But when they proceeded in this Tyrannicall manner, banishing some, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> others to death, they became so deepely hated of all men, that they were deposed and expulsed.

But Pausanians King of the Lacedemonians comming to Athens with an army, made agreement betweene them that were in the citie, and the banished men that were without: And from that time forward the Athenians began to gouerne themselues af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their ancient manner.

and more forward to attempt things with desperate rashnesse, followed Caesars hopes.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> Crassus swumme in the middest, making his vse of both, and oft changing parts in the administration of the Commonweale, being neither a constant friend, nor a dangerous and deadly enemie, but did easily dissolue both friendship and enmitie, as hee saw it for his profit, so that very oft within small distance of time hee would praise and blame, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend and accuse the same lawes and persons. Then these three personages ioining their factions together, did for a time gouerne the whole state of Rome, according to their owne wils with generall consent, which was the ouerthrow of the people and Senate. And afterward he saith, When Caesar was come from his Prouince of Gaule, so farre as Lucca, many Romanes came to see him, and amongst the rest, Pompey and Crassus,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> who hauing conferred with him in secret, concluded to goe throughly forward with their purpose, to the end, that they might haue in their owne hand all the power of the Romane Empire.

<pb n="301" facs="tcp:7218:166"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and many of those states that are called Aristocraties, wherein the Aristocraties doe differ from those that are named Commonweales, and therefore some of them last the lesse time, and some longer. For those are called Aristo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>raties which bend most to the Oligarchie, and those are named Commonweales which bend most to the multitude. Therefore such kinds of states are more safe and sure then others. For they to whom the Commonweale is imparted and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, are the greater number and more strong; and when they enioy equality, they are the easier to be contented: but where they that abound in richesse, are of most authority in the state, they seeke for nothing else but to iniure and excell others too much. To conclude, towards which part soeuer of the two the Commonweale inclineth, it is changed, by reason either of them goe about <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to augment their owne side. As for example, the Commonweale is changed into a Democratie, and the Aristocratie into an Oligarchie, or into contraries, as the Aristocratie into a Democra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, because the poorest sort, as men iniuried, draw the Commonweale cleane to the contrary. And Commonweales are changed into Oligarchies. For equality alone according to worthinesse, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the state stable, when euery one enioieth that which pertaines vnto him. This my saying was verified amongst the Thurians, who at the first chose their Magistrats in respect of the greatest reuenues, and after came to a lesse stint, and had a greater number of them. And when the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen had gotten all the land into their hands, contrary to the law in that behalfe prouided (by reason the forme of gouernment was most Oligarchicall, and authorised them greatly) then the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> people being exercised in armes, and of experience in wars, ouermaistred the guards, and compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led those which held too great possessions to yeeld them vp. Further, for asmuch as all Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weales that are Aristocraticall do incline to the rule of a few, the Noblemen may doe more there: as at Lacedemon the wealth is in a few mens hands, and the Noblemen haue the most liberty to do what they wil, and to bestow their children in mariage, as best liketh themselues: which thing caused the destruction of the Commonweale of Locres, by the alliance und affinity which they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into with Dionisius, which could not haue befallen in a Democratie or Aristocratie, well mixed and tempered. But then is there a secret change in Popular states, when they are marred by little and little, as it happeneth in all Commonweales, as hath beene before shewed, in speaking <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> generally of their alterations, when we said, that the neglecting of smal matters is one of the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses thereof.

But cheefely, as well that which is called a Commonweale as the Aristocratie, is dissolued, when the law is broken; which disorder is bred, by reason that the Democra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and Oligarchie are not well mixed in the Commonweale nor in the Aristocratie, with vertue: For which cause such kinds of states are changed, one while into Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craties, another while into Oligarchies, according to the power of the factions. As for example, the Commonweale is changed into a Democratie, and the Aristocratie into an Oligarchie; or the Aristocratie into a Democratie, and the Commonweale into an Oligarchie. Also these Commonweales are marred by little and little, as the others are,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> by letting slippe some small mischeefe at the beginning, and after by suffering a greater mischeefe, till at last all the whole order and state bee there changed. Moreouer, euery kind of Commonweale is dissolued, either through an inward disease and mischeefe at home, or by another contrarie and mightie Commonweale, either neere to it, or farre from it.</p>

And when they came to the age of thirtie yeares, perceiuing themselues vnprouided of any manner of lands, or goods, because they had no certaine fathers whom they might succeed, they made choise of one Phalantus for their Captaine (who had beene the authour of sending the yong men from the armie) and conspired against their countrey.

This treason being disclosed by the seruants to the Officers, was by them

               <head>CHAP. VIII. Of the perticular preseruation of states.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>NOw wil we treat of the preseruation of all states in general, &amp; of euery one perticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly. First it is certaine, that if we perceiue by what meanes states are destroyed; wee shall also vnderstand those whereby they are preserued. Forasmuch as of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary causes spring contrary effects, and for that perishing or destruction is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to preseruation. Therefore in well tempered Commonweales, heed should bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> aboue all things; that nothing be done contrary to the laws and customes, and specially that an inconuenience &amp; mischeefe should be looked vnto at the first budding; how small soeuer it be. For the corruption that creepeth in by little &amp; little, is no more perceiued, then small expences be, the often dibursing whereof consumeth the substance of a house. This change is not noted, by reason it commeth not altogether, for mans vnderstanding is therein deceiued, as by a sophistical and cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious reason, inferring that if euery part be smal, the whole must needs be small: The which is in some respect true, yet is not so: For the whole &amp; all are not a smal thing, but are composed of small things. Therefore the cheefe point of all consisteth in taking diligent heed of this beginning, and the next in not crediting those subtleties which are craftily and captiously inuented to deceiue the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> people. For why, they are sufficiently reproued and refelled of themselues by their owne workes. We haue set downe before what we call wiles and crafts of Commonweales.

Also by not defrauding the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of honor that be ambitious and desirous therof, nor depriuing the multitude of profit, &amp; by liuing popularly &amp; courteously with their fellows. For the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> equality that the popular sort do seek for in the multitude, is not only iust, but also requisit to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued amongst such as are of like estate. Therfore if there be many in the gouernment, it is expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for them to obserue many popular fashions: as to create the Magistrates for the space of sixe months, to the end, that all they that be in such sort like, may be p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And therfore there often arise amongst them leaders &amp; flatterers of the people, as hath ben before declared. Again, by this meane the Oligar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies &amp; Aristocraties fal lesse into Potentacies, for it is not so easie a matter to enterprise any wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse; by remaining a short time in the Magistracie, as by continuing a long space in the same: which breedeth Tirannies in Oligarchies and Democraties, for they exercise Tyranny that be of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> most power in each state; as the captaines of the people, and the Potentates; or els they that possesse greatest Magistracies, if they continue long in the same. Also Commonweales are preserued, not only by being farre from those things that may marre &amp; dissolue them, but also by being neer thereto, for feare maketh men more heedy and circumspect about affaires concerning the state. Therfore they that are careful of the welfare of the commonweale, ought ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times to propound &amp; fain certain fears, to the end, that the citizens should be alwaies ready to make defence, as the soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But there is no greater rule to be obserued in euery co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>weal, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to prouide by the laws, that the publick offices be not gainfull, &amp; specially this ought to be obserued in the Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garchie: for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon people take it not in so euil part, that they are barred fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t (but rather reioice that they may spend their time about their own busines) as whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they think the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strats rob the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>weale, for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiue they a twofold spight that they are depriued both of honors <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> &amp; profit. And by this only meanes may the Democratie and Aristocratie stand, &amp; be together by yeelding to the noblemen &amp; to the common people what they demand: which is a thing that may be done. For the admitting of all men indifferently into the gouernment, is Democratical: And that the Noblemen should be Magistrats, is Aristocraticall: which wil befal whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the officers shall be stripped of all means to draw profit out of the same. In which case the needy will not bee hasty to haue it, because they shal get nothing by it, but wil be willinger to apply their own businesse: &amp; the rich may better exercise the Magistracies, because they haue no need to gain by the commonweal: insomuch, that the poore wil become rich by hauing leisure to ply their work, &amp; the noblemen shal not be subiect to the rascal people. But to the end the common treasure be not robbed, let payment <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> be made of the mony of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monweale in presence of al the citizens, &amp; the rols or bils of account deliuered into the custody of the fraternities, companies, &amp; tribes of the city. And to the end the Magistrats may execute their offices without gain, it is reason that honors be set down by law for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that wel &amp; orderly shal execute the same. Now in Democraties it is reason the rich should be spared, &amp; their possessions and fruits not diuided &amp; made equal with other mens, as is priuily co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed in some commonweals. And it is better to forbid them the making of great &amp; vnprofitable expences, as at open shewes, &amp; in the lanes with torchlight and such like. So also in the Oligarchie it behoueth to haue great care of the poore, and distribute vnto them those Magistracies wherein there is some profit to be had, &amp; where any rich man doth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> iniury to punish him more greeuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> then one poor man should be for hurting another. Also that inheritances desce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d not by way of gift, but by right of kindred &amp; consanguinity: &amp; that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may haue aboue one inheritance. By means hereof, the goods &amp; possessions shal be the equaller, &amp; many needy persons shal become rich Also it is expedient in the Democratie &amp; Oligarchie, to giue to them that haue least preferment and part in the gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, either an equal part or the cheef parts in al other things; as in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocratie to the rich, &amp; Oligarchie to the poore: except those offices wherein the authority of the

It doth particularly auaile the Oligarchies for auoiding of alteration, happening there by the stint of reuenues, to make from time to time surueyes of their wealth, and to augment or deminish the reuenue, according to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the tenor of the law, as wealth encreaseth or decreaseth. It is also behoofeful to Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craties and Oligarchies, to treat them in the best sort that is possible, that enioy least part in the state, as the rich in Democraties, and the poor in Oligarchies; except in such cases as concerne the cheefe Magistracies, wherein consisteth the soueraine authority of the Commonweale, which ought to be administred only by them of the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IX. Of the qualities that are to be required in the cheefe gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of a state.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>THey which are to exercise the cheefe Magistracies, ought to haue three thinges: First, a loue to the present state: next of all, great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> sufficiencie to execute those functions and charges that are required in the office: Thirdly, Vertue and Iustice, fit for euery Commonweale. For if the Lawe bee not all one, and the selfesame in euery Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweale, it followeth that there must needes bee many differences of iustice. But there is a doubt, when all these thinges are not to bee found in one selfesame person, howe men shall proceed to the election, I meane if any one bee sufficient to guide an armie, but in other respects a bad man, and not a friend to the State; and another iust and a friend thereto; In what manner shall the election bee made? In mine opinion it is needfull to haue respect to two points, to wit, to that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> all men doe most participate, and are most endued withall; and to that wherein they least participate, and are least endued withall. Therefore in the choise and election of a generall captaine, wee must rather haue an eye to experience in martiall affaires, then to vertue; for there be fewer expert captaines then good and honest men. Contrariwise, in the keeping and disposing of the mony and treasure of the Commonweale, greater vertue is to bee required, then men for the most part are endued withall, although the science and skill be common to all men. Also a doubt may be mooued, if a man haue sufficiencie in him to gouerne, and beare good will to the state, what need he shall haue of vertue, if with those two things he may be able to perform as much as is expedient; or whether vertue be requisit also: because it may so fall out, that those men <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> that be indued with these two things, may bee vicious and incontinent liuers, who though they know they offend and loue themselues, yet can they not helpe themselues by gouerning their owne affections. So may it befall, that some men may thus demeane themselues toward the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale. Generally, whatsoeuer we affirme to be enacted by law, to the benefit of Commonweals, doth preserue and vphold Commonweales. But the cheefe groundworke (as we haue already often tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched) lyeth in procuring that party and side which is content with the present state, to be stronger then the other that is malecontent therewith. Besides all this, we are not to bee ignorant of those things whereof those commonweales are ignorant at this day, that haue transgressed and swarued from the meane. For many things that are supposed to be ordained for the auaile of the people, do <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> dissolue the popular states. And diuers other things that seem apt and fit for the state and gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a few, do marre and destroy the same. They who suppose any such thing to be a vertue and perfection, do draw the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monweale to excessiuenesse, not knowing that as a mans nose that som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what goes out of that straight &amp; right forme which is cheefly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended, so as it yeelds somewhat toward crookednesse or fatnesse, is notwithstanding faire &amp; comely to the eie, howbeit, if any man stretch it further to excessiuenesse and too much, first he takes away the proportion and due mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the member, &amp; at last brings it to that passe, that it will seeme no more a nose, by reason of the excessiuenesse or want of contraries. And so fares it with other parts of the body. The very like doth come to passe in Commonweales. For the Oligarchie and Democratie may be borne withall,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> though they be far fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their good order: But if either of them be farther and more stretched out, first the Comonweale shall be impaired, and at last they will proceed so far, that it shal no longer be a Commonweale. Therfore the lawmaker and man fit to gouerne, must haue skill &amp; discretion to know what popular means vphold or destroy the Democraties, &amp; what things fit for Oligarchies do preserue the Oligarchy, sith neither of these two states can stand without rich men &amp; the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude; for if goods should be equal, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> must the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monweale needs change hir form. Therfore the
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:7218:170"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> destroying of the rich, or of the poore, by vnreasonable lawes, is the ruine of Commonweales. Some doe offend and stray from the right way, both in Democraties and Oligarchies; namely, the ringleaders of the people in Democraties (where the multitude is maister of the lawes) by keeping the city alwaies diuided into two sects or parts, striuing against the rich, though to the contrary they seeme euermore to speake in the behalfe of the rich: and in Oligarchies, the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and fautors of the same, who ought euermore to shew themselues fauourers and furtherers of the peoples benefit, and to take other maner of oaths then they do at this time. For now adaies in some Oligarchies they sweare in this manner: I will bee the peoples enemie, and practise as much mischeefe against them as lyeth in my power. Yet were it conuenient that they should shewe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and dissemble the contrary, and promise vpon their oaths to doe the people no wrong. The readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est way and greatest meanes that hath yet ben spoken off, for the vpholding and maintaining of Commonweales (which at this day is neglected in all places) is that the bringing vp &amp; training of children and youth, bee fitted according to the Commonweales. For most behoofefull laws and decrees ratified by the consent of all the gouernours, doe no good at all, except the subiects bee accustomed and trained to frame their liues and manners, according to the pattern of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweale: as for example, if the lawes bee popular, let them bee trained and brought vp popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly; But if the lawes be fit for the Oligarchie, then let them be brought vp Oligarchically. For if there be incontinence in any one, it is also in the Citie. Now conuenient training and bringing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> vp according to the patterne of the Commonweale, is not to accomplish matters for the pleasing of the Gouernours in Oligarchies or Popular states, but rather such kind of things, whereby the one sort may be maintained in the Oligarchie, and the other in the Democratie. Now in Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garchies the children of the Gouernours bee nicely and daintily brought vp, and poore folkes children are exercised and hardened with labour, so as they haue the more will and power to practise innouation. And in those Democraties that seeme most popular, there is no such kind of order as there ought to bee, because libertie is there not right; but euill defined and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood. For two things there bee, whereby the Democratie seemeth to bee defined and rightly taken, to wit, by the authoritie which is in the hands of the greatest part of the people; and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> by libertie: For that which is iust and rightfull, seemeth to bee equall: and this seemeth to bee equall, that those thinges bee ratified which please the multitude: and liberty and equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie seeme to consist in this, that euery man doe what hee list. Therefore in such Democra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties euerie man liueth according to his owne pleasure and desire, as Euripides sayeth: But that is starke naught. For the manner of liuing and demeaning of men according to the forme and patterne of the Commonweale, is, not to bee iudged a bondage, but a welfare and safetie. These be the meanes whereby Commonweales are changed and ouerturned, and whereby they are vpheld and maintained.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Sith it is a thing most requisite for the vpholding of states, that the soueraigne Magistracies bee in the hands of fit and sufficient persons: Therefore are the qualities hereof declared, that bee necessary for the cheefe Gouernouts of a state, which bee three. First they must loue the present state; secondly, they must haue sufficiencie, skilfulnesse, and experience in gouernement; thirdly, they must bee indued with that kind of vertue and vprightnesse which is fit for the Commonweale wherein they are. If all these things bee not to bee found in one man, that kinde of qualitie is cheefelie to bee considered in the election of the Magistrate, which most sildome is found in men. But nothing is fitter for the vpholding of a State, then the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> of that side (which is content with the present State) stronger then the other side that is not content therewith. Further, discretion is to bee vsed, that there bee no excessiuenesse and vnmeasurablenesse in those meanes that vphold Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weales, as in the meanes that are fit for Democraties and Oligarchies. Because that by stretching them out too farre, such Commonweales are impaired, and at last ruinated, when the rich in the one are destroied, and the poore in the other driuen out. Also it is requisit for the preseruation of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monweales to fit the bringing vp of citizens
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:7218:171"/>
according to the patterne of the same. As, if the lawes be popular, that they be brought <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> vp popularly: And if the Lawes be fit for Oligarchies, that then they be brought vp Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garchically: and that the one sort may be maintained in Democraties, and the other in Oligarchies.</p>

                     </gap> in King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and Tyrannies, as wee said, did chaunce in Commonweales: For the Kingly State doth imitate the Aristocratie, and the Tyranny is made of the extreamest sort of the Oligarchie, &amp; of the Democratie, &amp; is ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore very hurtfull to the subiects, for it is compounded of two corrupt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweales, retaining the transgressions and blemishes of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, it will easily appeare, that the beginning of Monarchies hath proceeded of contraries, for the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> Kingly state was first ordained for the defence of good men against the multitude: and the King was created out of the number of good men, according to the excellency of his vertue, or vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous deeds, or of the stock from whence he came. The Tyran was created by the multitude, against the Noblemen, to the end, that they should not oppresse them, as is manifest by the euents and is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues of things. For almost all Tyrans haue become so, through being Captaines and leaders of the people, hauing gotten credite by forging accusations against the Nobilitie. Then one sort of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannies hath sprung vp in this manner, the Cities being already growne great. Others, of those that hauing been Kings before, haue violated the ancient customes of the Countrey, desiring to command more absolutely. Others, of such as haue been chosen to the cheefest Cities: for in anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> times the people allowed long time to Magistracies and publick charges. And others of Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garchies, where they had chosen and preferred some one to great offices, for to hold them in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of soueraignety: for in all these manners they might easily vsurpe a Tyrannie, if they were but willing thereunto, because some had alreadie the power of a Kingly estate, and others the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, as Phidon in Argos, and others which made themselues Tyrans, hauing before Kingly au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; and those of Ionia and Phalaris, the honour. Panecius among the Leontines, and Cyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selus at Corinth, and Pisistratus at Athens, and Dionisius at Syracusa, and others in the same sort, of Captaines of the people haue become Tyrans. So the Kingly state doth resemble the Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratie, in that it is giuen according to the persons dignity, or through his vertue, or birth, or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> deeds, or through all these things together, and through power. For all those that haue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> well deserued, or might well deserue of Cities and Countries, haue attained to this honour; some <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> in defending them from bondage, as Codrus; others in setting them at libertie, as Cyrus; some for building a City, or conquering a Country, as the Kings of the Lacedemonians and Molossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The office of a King, is to see that the rich be no way iniuried, nor the multitude outraged. The Tyrannical State (as hath been often said) hath no respect to the publicke commodity, vnlesse it be for his owne peculiar profit: and the only end end or aime of a Tyran, is pleasure; of a king, honesty. Wherefore the desire to exceed in mony, is Tyrannicall; and to excell in honour, more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> kingly. The kings guard is of Citizens, the Tyrans of strangers. That the Tyrannie hath the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> and corruptions of the Democratie and Oligarchie, it is manifest: of the Oligarchie, in that it chuseth riches for the only end whereat it aimeth; otherwise the guard and magnificence ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to requisite, could not be maintained: likewise, in that it doth in no sort trust the multitude, and therefore takes their weapons from them. Item, the oppression of the people, the driuing them out of the Citadell, and forcing them to disperse themselues, is common to them both, as well to the Oligarchie, as to the Tyrannie. It taketh likewise of the Democratie, the making of war against

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the Nobles, the destroying of them by couert, or open meanes, and banishing them as aduersaries and enemies to that state, because they are the Authours of conspiracies: when some will seeke to rule themselues, others refuse to endure subiection.

               <p>The Philosopher, after hee hath declared the meanes whereby Commonweales are altered and destroyed, hee reasoneth likewise touching Monarchies, whereof there are two sorts, to wit, the Kingdome, and the Tyrannnie; shewing the beginning of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of them, together with the difference of their ends, and causes which marre and destroy them: affirming them to be the very same that be in other Commonweales; the Kingdome following the steps of the Aristocratie, and Tyrannie imitating the Oligar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie and the Democraties. The end and scope of the king is the profit of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale, whereunto he referreth all things. The end and scope of the Tyran is pleasure. The office of the King is to prouide, that the rich be not in any wise iniuried, nor the common people outragiously and reprochfully dealt withall. The Tyran regardeth not the Commonweale, except it be for his own priuate profite, hauing all the faults of the Oligarchie, and of the Democratie.

And therefore sought they to learne of their gods what the successe of the warre should be: It was answered them that they should haue the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, so they killed not the king of the Athenians. For this cause they assembled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues against them, and comming to the battaile, before and aboue all thinges they commanded their men to take heed that they slew not the King of the Athenians, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Codrus: who being aduertised of the answere giuen by the gods, and of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of the Dorians, clothed himselfe in base apparrell, and tooke a burthen of boughes vpon his backe, which he carried into the Dorians campe. And because there was a great throng, he of set purpose with a bill which he carried about him, stroke and hurt a souldior, who presently slue him. And after he was dead, the Dorians perceiuing it was Codrus King of the Athenians, went their waies without fighting any battaile.

Besides these two Offices, the Romane Emperours had one difficultie, which lay in fitting themselues to the crueltie and couetousnesse of the men of warre, a thing of such toile and loathsomenesse, that it wrought the destruction of the most of them. For it was altogether vnpossible to satisfie both the people and the souldiours together. For the people loue quietnesse and peace, and so doth the Prince that is of a mild and modest nature: whereas contrariwise, the souldious desire a Prince that is warlike, insolent, cruell, and giuen to spoile, wherein their desire was to traine the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours to the hinderance of the people, for the encreasing of their owne paies and pensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and for the satisfying of their couetousnesse and cruelty: which was the cause that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> some Emperours hauing neither by cunning nor by nature the dexterity and skill to keepe both the one and the other in aw, did commonly continue small times their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies.

                  <hi>We must therefore deeme, that the beginnings of alterations in Monarchies, are almost all one with those that happen in Commonweales, as hath been already declared: for many subiects are prouoked to conspire against the Monarchies by reason of iniustice, and for feare, and for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> contempt. Iniustice is cheefly committed by occasion of reproch and iniury, and sometimes also by occasion of spoiling men of their goods. And they tend to the same ends in Tyrannies, &amp; king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> as they doe in the aforementioned Commonweales: for asmuch as Monarchs abound in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> riches and honours, to which things all men aspire. Some conspiracies bee made against the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of Princes, othersome against their state. Those that are done for reproch and iniurie, are against the person. And as there be many sorts of iniuries, euery of them is cause of despight and wrath. The most of them that be incensed to wrath, doe conspire, to the end to bee auenged, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> not to excell others. As the conspiracie against the children of Pisistratus was caused through the iniury done to Harmodus his sister, and by reason that he himselfe had ben prouoked, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spightfully handled: For Harmodus became their enemie for his sisters sake, and Aristogiton for Harmodus his sake. Also there grew a conspiracie against Periander the Tyran of Ambracia,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> for that as he sat at a banquet he had asked a yong boy that he loued, whether he were with child <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> by him. Pausanias slew King Philip, because he neglected the iniury that was done vnto him by Attalus. Derdas conspired against Amintas, surnamed the small, because hee boasted of the abusing of his youth. Euagoras the Cyprian conspired against Eunucus, whose sonne he slew, for the iniury which he thought he had receiue at his hands, in that he forsooke his wife, who was the said Euagoras his kinswoman. Also many rebellions haue been made against Monarchs, for

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the villanous and shamefull acts that some of them haue committed against the bodies of other folke: as the rebellion of Crates against Archelas, who was alwaies greeuous and irkesome vnto him, because he had his vnlawfull company; insomuch, that this occasion, and also a lesse, sufficed him: or because he gaue not him any of his daughters in marriage, as he had promised. But when he was intangled in the warres with Sirria and Arrabia, hee married the eldest to the King of Elibee, and the youngest to the sonne of Amintas, supposing therby to haue lesse controuersie with him that was borne of Cleopatra. Notwithstanding, the ground and true cause of the hatred and turning of Crates his mind against Archelas, was for that hee tooke it in euill part that hee was procured and compelled to serue his filthy lust. Hellanocrates of Larissa conspired vpon the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> very like occasion: For when Archelas had abused his youth, because he restored him not into his country according to his promise. This Hellanocrates imagined that Archelas had desired &amp; vsed his company to iniury and reproch him, and not for loue. Paron, Heraclides, and Enian, slew Cotis to bee reuenged for the iniury done to their father. And Adamas forsooke Cotis and went from him, because he had caused him to be gelded in despight &amp; reproch, while he was a boy.

               <p>Three things prouoke subiects to conspire against Monarchs, namely, iniustice, fear and contempt: &amp; conspiracie is made either against the person of the Prince, or against his state. That conspiracie which proceedeth of iniury, whereof there are many sorts, is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> against the person of the king for reuenge of outrage, dishonor, or domage receaued. Touching the which Aristotle alledgeth many examples fetched from the manners &amp; customes of Greece, whereto it is easie to adde an innumerable others, both ancient &amp; moderne, wherwith we may be furnished by the licentious life of princes in their great authority.

               <p>INIVSTICE <hi>is cheefly committed by occasion of reproch and iniury, and sometimes also vpon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> occasion of spoiling men of their goods.</hi>] Aristotle in the chap. folowing saith, The Monarch ought to abstaine from all kinds of iniury, and specially from two sorts; the one, from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> beating of folke, the other from dishonouring youth by filthy lust. Therefore iniuries concerne goods, bloud, or honour. Of those that concerne blood, the threatnings are more dangerous then the execution, yea they are most dangerous, and the execution without all perill; for he that is dead, cannot thinke of reuenge, and they that be aliue, for the most part, care very little or nothing at all for it: but hee that hath been threate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and seeth himselfe of necessitie constrained to doe, or suffer, becommeth a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous person, and one greatly to be feared by the Prince. Next to this necessity, goods and honour are the two thinges which most offend men, and whereof the Prince is to take heed, for he cannot strip a man so naked, but he shall leaue him a knife to worke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> withall, nor so much dishonour him, but he wil yet retaine a stedfast mind to seek for redresse.

But Thucidides speaketh otherwise concerning this matter in his first booke: The Athenians (sayth he) beleeue and say commonly that Hipparcus was slaine by Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modus and by Aristogiton, because he was a Tyran; and consider not howe at the same time that he was slaine, Hippias that was the eldest sonne of Pisistratus, reigned in the City of Athens, whose brethren Hipparcus, and Thessalus were, and that one day Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modus and Aristogiron (who had vndertaken to kill them all three) imagining that the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> matter had ben disclosed to Hippias by some of their complices, durst not execute their enterprise against him, doubting least he were aduertised of it. But neuerthelesse they determined to doe some act worthy of memory before they were taken.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> PAVSANIAS <hi>slew king Philip, because he neglected the iniury done vnto him by Atta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus.</hi>] Plutarch in the life of Alexander the great, declareth that murther in this manner: When Pausanias had been villainously outraged in his body by the knowledge &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> of Attalus and Cleopatra, and could not obtaine redresse nor iustice at the hands of king Philip, he turned his wrath against him, and slew him for despight. The fault of which murther was for the most part imputed to Olimpias, for shee (as the report went) prouoke and incensed this young man boiling in anger, so to doe: but there was some suspition also that touched Alexander. Iustine in his ninth book setteth downe this matter more plainely. While King Philip expected the aid of Greece, hee determined to celebrate the marriage betweene Alexander, whom hee had made king of Epyrus, and Cleopatra his daughter. So the day was appointed whereon the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age should bee solemnised in great triumph, as the dignity of the two Kings required:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> whereat there were many playes and pastimes.

By this meanes the day which had ben appointed for great triumph, was turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to great mourning. This Pausanias had ben in his youth violently abused in his body
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:7218:173"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> by Attalus, who besides the reproch &amp; outrage he had done vnto him, committed ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing against him that was more villainous: For hee caused him to come to a ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, and when hee was drunken, was not content to abuse his body, but exposed it to other of the gests, as a common strumpet, whereupon euery body after derided &amp; moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him: of which reproch and outrage hee had often made complaint to king Philip, who fed him with words, and laughed him to scorne. Therefore when hee saw that hee who had committed this reproch and outrage, was honoured, and made Captaine and lieutenant to the king, he turned his anger against the king himselfe. Thus reuenged he his iniury vpon the iudge, because he could not reuenge it vpon the partie. Many were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of opinion, that Olimpias (Alexanders mother) had procured him to this deed, and that Alexander was priuy to it, because he was no lesse angry and displeased that Philip had forsaken Olimpias his mother, to marry Cleopatra, then that Pausanias had ben so vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abused, and specially for that hee doubted least Philip would leaue the kingdome to the sonne which he had by Cleopatra: Diodorus Siculus in the six and twentieth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his sixteenth booke, declareth all the matter at large, concluding in this manner: Behold how Philip who was the greatest king of his time that was in all Europe, and who for the greatnesse of his power placed himselfe in the ranke of the twelue gods, pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully ended his daies, after he had reigned the space of foure and twenty yeares.

And it is said, that himself gloried more in his martiall wisedome, and the exploits he had done through good skil to deale wisely in matters, then in those that he had executed by prowesse and force of armes. For in victories (said he) all they which fight in the battaile, haue part; but in the exploits, which I haue done by skill of handling of matters wisely, the honour is due to none but to my selfe alone.</p>

Therefore Artabanus comming secretly by night into the kings cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> by the meanes of his Eunuch, slew him in his bed: &amp; then went straight towards his children, who were three in number, to wit, Darius the eldest, the second Artaxerxes, and the third Histaspes, who at that time was absent from the court, for he had the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of the countrey of the Bactrians. Nowe then after the killing of Xerxes, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabanus went to Artaxerxes, for it was night still, and gaue him to vnderstand, that his brother Darius had slaine their father, to the intent to vsurpe the kingdome: And coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selled him so to deale (before his brother had got all into his possession) that through his owne slouthfulnesse and want of courage, hee were not compelled to serue, where hee might be lord, make himselfe king, and bee auenged vpon him that had slaine his father; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> promising him withall (if he would enterprise the matter) to giue him the guards of his fathers body. Artaxerxes beleeued it, and presently went with the guards of his father, to kill Darius his elder brother. Therefore Artabanus perceiuing his enterprise in such forwardnesse, tooke his owne children with him, telling them that nowe was a fit time to get the kingdome, and bending himselfe against Artaxerxes, stroke him with a sword: Artaxerxes feeling himselfe wounded, but not to death, quickly tooke his sword to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend himselfe, and stroke Artabanus so right, that he fell dead to the ground. Thus Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes being almost wonderfully saued, and hauing withall reuenged the death of his father, succeeded him in the kingdome and in the Empire of Persia.

Notwithstanding within a short time after, when he perceaued himselfe driuen to it, he came foorth with a few men without order to the battel: where being immediatly ouercome, withdrew himselfe to his roial palace, wherin he caused a pile of wood to be made, then did he set himself &amp; his riches vpon it, causing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> fire to be put vnder it, performing in that thing only, a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s act.

In like sort the estate of Cyrus lasted not long in his progeny, but decaied through the enuy which Cambises bare to his brother Smerdis; and through his insolence.

And yet notwithstanding euermore remaineth the royall dignity and authority in his perfection, not wholly absolute, nor too much restrained, but ruled and bridled with good lawes, statutes, and customes, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> which be so established, that they can hardly bee broken and frustrated, though some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and in some places, there doe some breach and violating of the same happen.

               <p>
                  <hi>TO speake generally, they are preserued by such meanes as are contrary to those that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy them: but to speake particulerly, kingdomes are maintained by reducing them to a more moderate form. For of how much the fewer things, the Princes be absolute lords,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:7218:179"/>
so much the longer must euery Princely state last, by reason they be lesse violent, and in manners <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> more equall to others, and consequently lesse enuied of their subiects. For this cause the kingdome of the Molossians lasted a great while, and so did the Kingdome of the Lacedemonians, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son the state at the beginning was diuided into two parts, and afterwards king Theopompus mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated it, as well in other things, as by adding thereunto the Magistracie of the Ephori, or Tribunes. For by cutting away some part of the Kings power, hee augmented the Kingdome in continuance of time. Insomuch, that in a certaine manner, he made it not lesser, but greater, as it is reported that he answered his wife when she did chide, and demanded if it were not a great shame for him to leaue the Kingdome lesse to his children then hee had receiued it from his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: No (sayd he) because I leaue it them in such plight, as it shall last the longer. Now, Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannies <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> are vpholden and preserued two manner of waies, very contrary each to other: The one is deliuered from hand to hand, and obserued by many Tyrans in their gouernements. It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, that the most part of those things which concerne this way, were inuented by Periander the Corinthian: and many like may be drawne out of the gouernment of the Persians. Therefore the meanes in old time inuented for the preseruation of Tyrannies, are these, as to abase and pull downe as much as is possible, the most excellent men, and rid away those persons that haue the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest minds, and not to permit vnto the subiects, feasts, assemblies, learning, nor any other like thing; but to beware of all things which haue accustomed to breed these two things, haughtinesse of stomacke, and mutuall confidence; to forbid them schooles and all other idle companies; and to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> prouide by all meanes, that all the subiects shal not know one another, because this knowledge cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth greater trust and faithfulnesse betweene them. That alwaies the yeomen of the guard, and strange people, shew themselues in the streets, and walke before the citizens. So whatsoeuer the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects goe about, shall not be kept secret, and they will grow by custome to haue lesse courage, by ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing continually: hereto may be added many other waies, according to the Persian and Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an fashions, which are Tyrannicall, &amp; of the same effect. Likewise, to seeke the disclosing of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer the subiects say and doe, and to haue spies; as they that at Siracusa were called reporters: &amp; Ieron sent hearkeners wheresoeuer there were any companies and meetings of people. For they are the lesse bould to speake their minds freely when they stand in feare of such kind of men, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> if they should be bold to speake freely, then wil they vse the lesse secrecie. That they accuse one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and fall at variance, friends with friends, the common people with the Noblemen, and the rich with the rich: and to impouerish the subiects, is Tyrannicall; to the end, there should be no guard kept, and that they being driuen continually to worke for their liuings, may haue no leisure to conspire. For example hereof, we haue those high towers of AEgypt, called Pyramides, the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples dedicated to the gods by the Cypselides, the building of Olimpus by the children of Pisistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, and the munitions of Policrates about Samos: which things tend all to one end, namely, to hinder aud impouerish the subiects: and so doth the exacting of tributes and money, such as hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened at Siracusa, where in the time of Dionisius the Tyran, the citizens in fiue yeares space were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> constrained to contribute all their goods. Againe, the Tyran maketh warres, to the intent, to occupie the subiects, and that they shall alwaies haue need of a head or captaine. Surely, the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is preserued by friends, but the propertie of a Tyran, is to mistrust friends; as though all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would, and friends cheefly could destroy him. Also all those things are tyrannical, which are done in the last and worst kind of Democratie, as the liberty of women in houses, who disclose their husbands secrets; and the infranchising of bondslaues for the same cause; for slaues and women attempt nothing against tyrans: it is rather needfull for them, in respect of the good vsage which they recei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e, to wish well to tyrannies and Democraties: For the people desireth to be a Monarch. Therefore the flatterer is in estimation with both of them; namely, with the people, the Popular <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> captaine, who is a flatterer of the people: and with the tyrans, they that behaue themselues lowly to them, which is a worke of flatterie. And therefore tyranny fauoureth the wicked, in as much as tyrans take a pleasure to be flattered, which neuer would any man of free and noble heart doe. But the good doe loue, or flatter not: also the wicked are profitable for them in wickednesse, for one naile driueth out another, as the Prouerbe is. Also it is a point of tyranny, not to take pleasure in a graue and free person, for the tyran himselfe will needs seeme alone to bee such a kinde of man.
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:7218:179"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> And whosoeuer on the contrary side vseth grauity and freenesse, he taketh away the excellencie and maisterlike authority of the Tyranny. Therefore Tyrans hate such manner of men, as the destroyers of their estate. Likewise<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> to feast and banquet more with strangers then with the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeens, it is a point of Tyranny, as if the one were enemies, and the other not aduersaries. These and other like things are Tyrannicall, and doe preserue the Tyranny, being neuerthelesse full of wickednesse. But all these meanes may in a maner be comprised in three<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> sith the Tyran doth aime cheefly at three things, The first is, that his subiects haue neither courage nor knowledge, because cowardly and ignorant men do neuer conspire. The second, that there be a mutual distrust among them, for the Tyranny is not destroyed, vnlesse some doe before repose confidence each in other. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> And for this cause Tyrans are enemies to good and vertuous men, as to those that may endam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage their estate, not only because they will not be vsed like slaues, but also because they are loyall and faithfull betweene themselues and to others, and doe not accuse either any of themselues, or any other. The third point is, that their subiects haue no power or meanes to execute any thing: For sith commonly men doe not vndertake things impossible, none will seeke to destroy the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, when they haue no power to doe it. These are the three ends whereto the Tyrans purposes do tend, and al the Tyrans enterprises may be reduced to these suppositions, that their subiects di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust each other, that they haue no power, and that they be cowards and ignorant. And this is the first manner of preseruing Tyrannicall states. The other manner hath a contrary consideration <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> in the things aforesaid, and may bee gathered from the destructions of kingdomes. For as the kingly state is destroyed through becomming more tyrannicall then it should, so the tyranny is preserued by approching neare to the manners and fashions of a kingdome, retaining still force and power to command not only those that do willingly obey, but those also that doe it vnwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, sith by loosing this force, he looseth both the name and state of a tyran. This foundation being presupposed and assured, he must partly vse those other manners and fashions also, and partly seeme to vse them, making thus a fayre outward shew of a good kingly gouernement. First and cheefly he must faine himselfe to be very carefull of the publicke good of the state, and vse no such expences as may offend the people, as to wast prodigally the reuenues and treasure of the Citie, on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> strumpets, strangers and players, but giue account of the money receiued and employed by him, as some tyrans in former times haue done. By doing so, he shall bee accounted a good husband for the Commonweale, and not a tyran. And he needs not feare want of mony at any time, being lord of the City: but it is good and profitable for tyrans when they goe abroad in any expedition, or other vrgent affaires, rather to want then to leaue treasure hoorded vp. For by this meanes, they that are deputed and appointed by them for the guard and keeping of the countrey in their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, will attempt the lesse against them. Now it is certaine, that these are more to be feared then the citizens, for the citizens goe with the tyrans, but the other remaine at home. Moreouer, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the imposition of taxes and subsidies, he must so carry himselfe therein, that hee seeme to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> leuie them for the maintenance of the state, and to employ the money that is therby gathered, in the preparing and prosecuting of the warre when neede shall require: and hee must make such an outward shew, that men may esteeme him as a keeper and treasurer of the pablicke mony, and not as of his owne. He must also not seeme austere, but graue, and of such behauior, as that they who shall haue occasion to speake vnto him, may not feare, but rather reuerence him: which thing hee can hardly doe, that is contemptible. Therefore although the Tyran should make no account of other vertues, yet at the least he ought to haue that which is requisite for a Gouernour, and cause such an opinion to be con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> as if he were a guardian and procurer of the good therof, and not a Tyran. He must further more make a shew to loue aboue all things God and religion, for the subiects stand in lesse feare of sustaining any wrong or oppression by Princes, if they thinke them to be religious, and that they feare the gods, and likewise they will lesse conspire against him whom they suppose that the gods doe loue and fauor. Now he must seeme such a manner of person without any suspition of wickednesse. Moreouer, he must honour and aduance good men that excell in any thing, so that they may not haue cause to thinke, that they might receiue greater honor or aduancement of their owne Citizens, if they liued in liberty. Besides, let the Tyran himselfe bestow honor on such men,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> and inflict punishments by others, as officers and iudges. There is yet farther a common precept for the maintaining and preseruing of euery kind of Monarchie; that is, to make no man ouer-great, or at the least to aduance more then one, because they will watch, and haue an eye on each other: but if it so fall out, that he must raise some one, let him not chuse one that is haughty &amp; au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datious, for such persons will boldly attempt what thing soeuer. Likewise, if he find it requisite to depriue any one of credite and authority; he must doe it by little and little, and not take from him all his power at once. Besides, hee must abstaine from all kind of iniury, and especially from two sorts, the one from beating folke, the other, from dishonouring youth by filthy lust; wherof he must take great heed towards those that are ambitious: For couetous persons doe take greeuously the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iury <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> that is offered them in taking away their goods; and those that are either ambitious, or good men, doe the like for the losse of their honour. Wherefore such punishments are not to bee vsed, or els to be inflicted according to the law and custome of the country, and not in contempt or reproch. And if it chance that he so conuerse with the youth, as before was said, let him doe it for loue, and not through tyrannicall liberty; at the least, if he doe them any dishonour, let him recompence it with greater honour. But amongst all them that conspire against the Tyrans person, which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to kill him, he must feare and take great heed of those who care not for their owne liues, so as they may rid him of his life, and he must cheefly dread those who thinke that any iniury hath ben offered, either to themselues, or to such persons as they hold dearest: for they that through despight <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> and anger attempt such things, haue neither feare nor carewhat becomes of themselues, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Heraclitus his saying, That it is an hard thing to fight against anger, which costs a man life. And whereas Cities consist of two parts, namely of poore men and rich men, it must be so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided, that both parts thinke their safety and preseruation to depend on the estate, &amp; there must great heed be taken, that they do not wrong or hurt each other in any thing. Only, let him haue the stronger on his side, that if any stirre arise, he bee not enforced to enfranchise the slaues, or to take the Citizens armour and weapons from them: for one of the two parts being ioined with his owne power, will be sufficient to resist the other part, if it should assaile him. But it were superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to prosecute such thinges particularly, sith the intention or aime thereof is manifest: for hee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> must referre all his actions to this end, that his subiects may not esteeme him to be a Tyran, but a steward and a king, and not as one that applieth all to his owne peculiar profit, but to the publicke good of the state, as guardian thereof. And that he obserue a meane in his life, and be not giuen to excesse; vsing familiarity with the Noblemen, and gratifying the people. By these meanes he shall doubtlesse make his state and gouernment not only fairer and more desirable, in that he raigneth ouer better subiects, and not seruile or abiect persons, and in that himselfe shall not be either ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or feared, but also of longer continuance.

               <p>The causes which destroy Kingdomes and Tyrannies, being declared; according to the former methode those causes also are set downe, which doe preserue and maintaine them: and first they are generally vpheld by those meanes that are contrary to the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of their ruines: as the Kingdome if it be lesse Tyrannicall and absolute, and the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, if it approch neerer to the Kingly state, which said Tyranny also is preserued and maintained in two manners, the one very rigorous, the other more moderate. To the

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> rigorous manner are referred all the seuere, or rather cruell acts which Tyrans are wont to doe, respecting onelie their owne safetie and profite, as to suppresse so much as may bee, the most notable persons, and to make away such as haue stout courages, to forbid their subiects the vse of banquets, schooles for studie, idle mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and all other things that breed haughtinesse of heart, and mutuall confidence, to keepe them from knowing each other throughly; (for this knowledge causeth grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter trust and faithfulnesse betweene them) to haue forraine souldiours, shewing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in the streets, and walking vp and downe before the Citti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ens houses, thereby to strike the more terror into them, and to keepe them in continuall feare, to haue spies &amp; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> priuie hearkeners in euery corner of the Cittie, who may discouer and report to him whatsoeuer shall be therein done or said. Likewise to vse such meanes, that friends may falsely accuse and liue in discord each with other, the vulgar sort with the Noblemen, and the rich men betweene themselues; to impouerish them, and haue them alwaies busied, to the end, that through wealth or idlenesse they may not conspire; and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing troubled with any warre, they may alwaies haue need of him to be their leader and cheefetaine. The kingdome is preserued and vpheld by friends, the Tyrannie doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together distrust friends, and therefore giueth great libertie to women and to slaues against their Lords. Tyrans must in no wise haue neere them graue and freeminded <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> men, because such persons doe diminish the Lordly excellence and authority of the Tyran, who will himselfe alone seeme and bee accounted such a kinde of man. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, when hee will banquet, let him doe it with strangers more then with Citizens: all which meanes being very Tyranncall, are reduced to three points. The first, that their subiects bee both cowardly and ignorant: the second, that they distrust each other: the third, that they haue no power nor meanes to conspire. Which three things being very pernicious, are not gathered by Aristotle to allow them, or instruct men in them, but rather that they may beware of them, by knowing the miserie of Tyrans, who are constrained to serue their turnes with such euils, thereby to assure <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> their persons and Estates. Machiauel of Florence writing of a Prince, hath taken from this place the most part of his precepts, adding thereunto Romane and Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an examples. Nowe almost all these meanes haue relation to the first manner of preseruing and vpholding Tyrannies, which is full of seueritie and rigour. The other manner contrarie to the former, as being more gentle and moderate, is, that the Tyran imitate the gouernement of the Kingly state; prouided that hee haue alwayes power, wherby he may command, not only ouer those that are voluntarily sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect (which thing a King doth) but also ouer those that doe vnwillingly obey. Hee must feine to haue great care of the publicke good of the State, and vse no prodigality, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to offend the people; not seeme a Tyran, but a steward; nor as Lord of the common treasure, but as bestower and keeper thereof; nor austere and haughtie, but graue and ciuile: hee must likewise beware that none of his traine doe iniurie any one, and especially that his women vse no outragious nor insolent demeanure toward other wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. He must moderately vse his pleasures, and aboue all things make shew of louing God and Religion. Hee must honour and aduance good men, and such as excell in any thing; and himselfe bestow rewards, but inflict punishments by others, as Officers and Iudges. The Tyran hath this common with the King, to make no man ouergreat, or els to aduaunce many, to the end, that they may haue an eye each to other: not to raise <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> haughty &amp; audacious men, who are vsually prompt and forward to attempt any thing; and when hee hath raised them, if hee find it requisite to pull them downe, he must doe it by little and little, not taking from them all their credite and power at once: hee must abstaine from all outrage, especially from beating any, and from dishonouring youth by filthy lust, or if he doe so, he must seem to do it rather for loue then through ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical liberty. And whereas cities consist of rich &amp; poore, who do not commonly wel agree; that he maintaine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> friendly togither, hauing the strongest alwaies on his own

side, that through their helpe hee may bee able to resist others that assault him.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> That he be familiar with Noblemen, and gratifie the people, so framing his manners, that hee bee good or halfe good, and not bad, but halfe bad. Aristotle seemeth to haue beene too curious in the setting downe of these Tyrannicall meanes, sith euill Princes are sufficiently inclined of themselues, to inuent what will serue for the maintaining of their high estate and safety, so as it is not needful to instruct them by bookes. Machiauel fashioning his Prince, hath fetched from hence (as I haue alleadged) the principall grounds of that institution, which must bee red with great discretion, because it is written by an Authour without conscience, and without religion, respecting onely worldly power and glorie, which deceiueth many men. But we that purpose to set forth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> nothing, which wee thought would not serue to the honour of God, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon welfare of mankind, will passe ouer these discourses, concluding with Cornelius Tacitus, That men are to honour things that be past, and to obey those that be present, and that they ought to loue good Princes: And whatsoeuer they bee, to tollerate and bear them, for the withstanding as much as is possible, of disorders that happen by alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. And as touching the decaies and vpholding of Monarchies, we will say with Salust. <hi>Si Regum atque Imperatorum animi virtus, in pace, ita vt in bello, valeret: aequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilius atque constantius res humanae sese haberent, neque aliud aliò ferri, neque mutari ac misceri omnia cerneres.

First the ordinarie armies that Augustus had ordained, as well about the Cittie of Rome, as in the borders of his State, did vndoe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of his successours, and brought to ruine the Romane Empire it selfe, which sometimes they put to sale, to deliuer it into his handes that would giue them most for it. Secondly, the transporting and remouing of the Romane Empire, which Constantine the great made from Rome to Byzantium (which since by his owne name hath beene called Constantinople) thereby to make it more sure and strong against the Persians, and other people of Asia: For by transferring vnto <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> this place the forces and cheefe richesse of the Romanes, and by deuiding the Empire into the Easterne and Westerne, hee did greatly weaken it, so as the Romane Empire was first destroyed, and then the Easterne: which if they had continued vnited, had beene able long, and almost for euer to withstand all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uasions.

This dissolution happeneth not only to plants, but also to earthly liuing creatures, with the fruitfulnesse and barrennesse of the soule and bodies, when the reuolutions of euery circuite of the circles, do fall shorter to them that bee shortliued, and contrary to them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> that be contrary. They whom you haue trained and brought vp to be Gouernors of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, though they be wise, shall not for all that know by reason together with vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, the fruitfulnesse or barrennesse of your kind, but shall be ignorant of the oportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to engender, and now and then shall beget children out of season. Nowe the peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ode or circuit of the diuine generation, is it that containeth the perfect number; and of the humane generation, in the which, first the increasings that surmount and excel; and three distances that be surmounted and taking the foure tearmes or bounds of likes and vnlikes, and of encreasing and decreasing, haue made all things answerable and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable together, of which tearmes the sesquitercian root ioined to the quinary, being <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> thrice augmented, doth make two harmonies; the one equall equally, an hundred ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But all things that haue beginning, must come to an end, and whatsoeuer groweth, must likewise deminish, being subiect to corruption and change, according to the time appointed vnto it by the course of Nature, as is seene by experience in plants, and in wights, which haue their ages and lastings certaine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined. This instabilitie is also found in Prouinces, Nations, Cities, Maners, Lawes, Sects, Empires, Realmes, Commonweales, Potentacies, States, Families, Sciences, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> Languages. We look for nothing but for the destruction of the world, and the day that shall consume this whole frame, containing all things both diuine and humane; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it to that old Chaos, and first darkenesse. Plato in Timeus, and in his Dialogue of the Gouernour. Aristotle in his Meteores, and Seneca in his natural questions, suppose this to happen by the fatall law of the world, as well according to the mouing of the first heauen, whereof the other inferiour or lower mouings, and all natures, do depend: As by the coniunctions and separations of the plannets, whereunto the elements, and all things that are composed of them, doe obey. Whereas then mens materiall bodies being created and composed of the foure elements and humors that bee contrary, are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> maintained and preserued in life, so long as the said humours do agree, yet is it vnpossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble but at the last one will exceed the others, and thereby the masse or lumpe, returne to his first matter by the dissoluing of the same combined mixture. Euen so falleth it out with the mysticall bodies of the societie of mankind, which being ioined by a ciuile and politicke vnion, do begin to decay by the diuersity of wils disagreeing, and at last come to nothing. And as mortall men liue so much the longer, and in better health, as they be of better complexion, and vse better gouernment; so are those cities and states that are best established and gouerned, maintained longer and in better sort: notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, there neuer hath ben nor can be any that endeth not quickly or slowly, how good <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> order soeuer be vsed therein: Such is the instability and course of all things that are here below, especially of states. Whereunto the most renowmed Astrologians doe agree, and that so farre, that they will determine not only the liues and fortunes of men, but also the prosperities and aduersities of Nations, as after the old Chaldeans and AEgyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, Ptolome hath done in his Quadripertite, and sithence the Arabians and some Christians adding thereto the lasting of sects Plutarch in the life of Romulus, speaking of Astrologers sayth, They will say that a Towne hath the reuolution and the time of the continuance thereof, prefixed, as well as the life of man; and that it may be knowne by the scituation of the star<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The skilfull Southsayers of Tuscane being demanded, answered, That this so strange signe declared the change of the world, and the passage from the same into another age: for that they hold opinion how there must be some ages cleerely differing one from another in manners and fashions of liuing. To euery of the which God hath prefixed a certaine time of continuance, howbeit, that all come to the ending of their

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> course within the space of the reuolution of the great yeere. And that when one is fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, and another ready to begin, there happeneth some meruellous and strange signe in the earth, and in heauen: so as they which haue studied in that science, doe straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way cleerely know how there be men borne, wholly differing from them that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in their liues and manners; and that be more or lesse acceptable to the gods, then they that were before. For they say, that amongst the great changes that happen at these passages from one age into another, the skill of foretelling things to come, groweth in reputation, and doth foretell aright when it pleaseth God to send more fit and more certaine signes, whereby it may be able to know and foreshew thinges to come. And <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> contrariwise, in another age it falleth into contempt, and groweth out of credite, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is rash, and faileth in the most part of her Prognostications, by reason it hath but darke meanes, and deformed instruments, to know what shal come to passe. Cicero is Scipios dreame, thus describeth this great yeare. <hi>Homines populariter annum tantum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modo Solis, id est vnius astri reditu metiuntur.

As for the reuolutions of others, there be few men that vnderstand them, know their names, measure and distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish them by number; insomuch, that they know not the times, and that their reuolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are infinite in multitude, and wonderfull in varietie.

In the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation of Timeus, which was published a good while agoe, we haue declared that Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to meant by the perfect number of time, when the seuen plannets, and other fixed stars come backe againe to their first places, and represent vnto vs the same nature that was in the beginning of the world, which time containeth an infinity of years, and renueth the world, giuing newe motion vnto it: Some say this great yeare containeth 15000 yeares of the sunne, others 36000: the firmament, on the which it is ruled, passing one <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> degree in euery hundred yeares: and because there be 365 degrees, therfore the course thereof cannot bee accomplished in lesse then 36000 yeares. Others reckon as farre as 49000, and that the neather world, from seuen thousand to seuen thousand yeares: and the heauenly, with al things generally, from fifty thousand to fifty thousand successiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, are infinitely renued: which proceedeth of the variable mouing of the eight sphere, one while from the East, another while from the West, sometimes from the South, and sometimes from the North, which the Astrologians call a mouing of Trepidation. This sphere from seuen thousand to seuen thousand yeares, maketh his said mouing, to wit, seuen times in all his secular reuolution: euery of which times causeth the dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> and renuing of this neather world: and when it is come to the seuenth after 49000 yeares, which are seuen times seuen, the heauenly world commeth to be entirely dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, to the end, that it may be thereupon renued, and take againe a communicating of forme and matter. The Chaldeans, Persians, AEgyptians, and old Grecians considered and iudged the cheefe euents of the world by the eclipses of the sunne and the moone, and by the starres, whose aspects are toward the places of the eclipses, or which ascend together, or are in the middest of the skie.

<pb n="340" facs="tcp:7218:186"/>
must needs haue the cheefe authority, and that which pleaseth many, must be the end and law. For <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> they say it behooueth that euery of the Citizens haue equality, insomuch, that in Democraties the poore haue greater authority then the rich, by reason they are the greater number. And in such a kind of state the opinion of the most preuaileth and is preferred. It is then a signe of liberty, that all that be popular or holders on the peoples side, doe set the same alwaies before their eies, as the end and foundation of the Commonweale: another token of libertie is<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> to liue as men list; which they call the effect of liberty: For as much as the propertie of bondage is, not to liue according to a mans owne descretion. This is the second end &amp; ground of the popular state; whence hath procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the not obeying of any man, sauing by turnes, and it furthereth the maintenance of that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, which is according to equality. This being presupposed, and this kind of beginning or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> foundation being laid, we affirme that these are popular institutions or properties, namely, that all the Magistrates be created out of all the citizens; and that all the citizens commaund and gouerne euery particular person; and that euery man when his time and turne falleth, gouerne all the Citizens; that the Magistracies be distributed by lots, either all, or those that require experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence or art; that in the giuing of Magistracies there be no respect in any wise had of reuenues, or very small; that no man may enioy one Magistracie twice, or very sildome, or very few, except the offices and charges of the warres; that the Magistrates continue but a small time in office, either all, or as many as is possible; that all the Citizens iudge causes, and that they be chosen out of men of all degrees, and haue the iudging of all controuersies and matters, or at least of very many,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> and of the weightiest and cheefest, as the correcting and calling to account of the Magistrates, and of the state of the Commonweale, and of priuate contracts and bargaines; that the assembly or congregation of the people haue the soueraigne authority of all matters, or of those that bee of greatest weight and importance; that the Magistrate haue cheefe authority in no matters, or in those that be of small weight. Now of Magistracies, the counsel or Senate is very popular, where no fees be appointed to all: for therein the power of this Magistracie is taken away, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to whom great fees are assigned, doe take into their owne hands all the iudgements, as hath ben declared in the former bookes: Then also that fees be giuen to all, cheefly to the assembly or ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall court, to the Iudges, and to the Magistrates; if all that be not possible, at least they giue fees <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> to the Magistrates, the Iudges, and the counsell, and to the cheefe assemblies, or to the Magistrates that are constrained to take their diet together. Againe, sith the Oligarchie is defined by noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of birth, richesse, and skilfulnesse, their contraries seem to be popular, to wit, basenesse of birth, pouerty, and being mechanicall. Likewise that no office be perpetuall, or if any remaine of the old change, that the power thereof be taken away; and that it be not giuen by election by voices, but by lots. These things be common to popular states. Now that which cheefly seemeth to be a popular state, and the extremest kind, proceedeth from the right or law that all men acknowledge to bee popular, which is, that all the Citizens enioy equality in number: For this is equality, that the rich gouerne not more then the poore, and that they alone haue not the authority, but all equally <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> in number: for by this meanes they thinke that they haue equality and liberty in such a kind of state.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Libertie being considered as the end in euery sort of Democratie, it dooth appeare in two things, namely, in the course of ruling and gouerning by turnes; and in the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense of liuing, as pleaseth euery man best, without yeelding obedience to any man otherwise then in his turne.

For if we account that right which few men determine, it is a Tyrannie, because if one rich man possesse more substance then the rest, according to the Oligarchicall right, he shall bee worthie of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement of the State.

               <p>
                  <hi>NOwe sith there are foure kinds of Democracies, that is the best kind which is the first in order, as wee haue declared in the former discourses, and it is the auncientest of all. I meane the first, according to the distinction of people. For the best sort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are the Husbandmen, so that a Democracie may bee establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, where they liue by Husbandrie or pasture. For such peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple because they haue not much wealth, are not idle, and cannot therefore frequent the publicke assemblies, and sith they want things necessarie for the sustenance of life, they follow their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> and seeke not other mens goods, but take greater pleasure in labouring then in gouerning and hauing Offices, especially if there bee small profite therein; for the vulgar sort preferreth profite before honour. There is an euident token hereof, in that men in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient times haue endured Tyrannies, and at this present they indure the Oligarchies, proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that they bee suffered to follow their labour, and that their goods bee not taken from them: for presently some grow rich, and the others are not in extreme want. Besides, to haue the authority of electing and controuling, or punishing the Magistrate, doth satisfie their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, if they haue any ambition. For among some people, although they haue not the right and power of electing the Magistrate, but some are by turnes appointed therevnto, as at Manti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> yet many are content to haue authority in the cheefe Counsell, and wee are to thinke that this is a forme of Democracie, as it was sometimes at Mantinea. It is therefore behoofefull for the aforesaid kind of Democracie, and the custome is such, that all doe elect and controule the Magistrates, and haue in their owne hands the power of iudging, that the cheefe Magistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies be held by persons chosen, and the greatest by those that haue greatest reuenue; or els without hauing any regard to the reuenue, by those which are fittest for them. The Commonweales which are so gouerned, must needs be well gouerned, for the Magistracies shall alwaies bee in the best mens hands with the peoples consent, who will not beare any enuy to good men: and they who are noble and good, ought to content themselues with this order, to the end, they be not gouerned by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> others worse then themselues: and in this manner their gouernment shall be iust, because the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection or punishment belongs to others: for it is very requisit and profitable that the Citizens be kept in order, and not suffered to doe what they list, for such absolute liberty causeth the same euill in a City, as it dooth in euery particular man; so that it is necessary that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweale shall receiue great good, when good men doe gouerne without the hurt and
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:7218:187"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> reproch of the people. It is therefore manifest that this is the best kind of Democracie, as also for for what cause it is so, viz. beeause the people therein is such. But for the inducing of them to follow Husbandry, there were certaine lawes which were in a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ncient times vsed by many, and are very profitable, as to suffer no man to haue any land, but according to a certaine measure and quantity, or els to a certaine place of the Citie. It was anciently ordained in many Cities, that the first inheritances might not bee sold. There is also a certaine law ascribed to Oxylus, tending to the same effect, which forbiddeth the lending of money vpon any peece of land. We may at this time ordaine and accommodate this, by meanes of the law of the Aphytali, which is very expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for that which we speake of: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>or although there be many, and they possesse a small territory, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> yet they are all Husbandmen, because they let not the whole possessions, but diuide them into so many parts, that the poore also may exceed them in reuenues. Next to the multitude of Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, the best sort of people are sheepeheards, who liue on their Cattell, for they agree in many things with the Husbandmens profession, and by exercise grow very fit for the warres, and haue their bodies hardened to liue and continue in the open aire without seeking any couert. Almost all the other kinds of people, whereof the Democracies consist, are worse then these, because their liues are bad, and because there is no vertue in the exercises of mechanicall and mercenary men, and of such as vse buying and selling. Besides, because all that sort of people is daily in the market place, and in the City, it is therefore easily assistant and present at publicke assemblies, but the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> being scattered abroad the Country, doe not assemble themselues, neither haue they such need thereof. And where the scituation of the place is such, that the Country is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>arre distant from the Citie, it is easie to establish a good Democracie and Commonweale, the multitude being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to make as it were Colonies in the fields. And therefore although there be a great number of those of the City, and of such as keepe or haunt the shops and markets, yet cannot they assemble themselues without those which dwell in the Country. Sith we haue declared how the best &amp; first kind of Democracie should be constituted, it may be easily vnderstood how the other kinds should be established, if men proceed therein by following the same manner, in separating or remoouing alwaies the worse sort of people. Touching the last kind of Democracie, because it is communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to all, it cannot bee endured by euerie Citie, nor bee easily preserued, vnlesse it bee established with good lawes and customes. Now wee haue shewed be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ore almost all the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions which destroy both such a forme of Commonweale and all other formes: but to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish this Democracie, and to make the people thereof mightie, they that haue knowledge in such matters of gouernment, haue beene accustomed to receaue thereinto as many men as they could, and to make Citizens, not only those that were lawfully borne, but bastards also, and those whose fathers or mothers only were Citizens, sith all this is fit for such a kind of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eople. When the guides and leaders of the people haue thus taken order for it, yet they must receiue so many, that the number of the vulgar sort may but exceed the Nobles, and those of meane <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Estate, and they must passe no further, for if they exceed them too much, they trouble the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweale, and they cause the Nobility of the Democracie to conceiue disliking and discontent; wherevpon the sedition at Cyrene was raised: for men make no accouut of a small incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience, but by encreasing it dooth more appeare. Furthermore, such ordinances are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for this kind of Democracie, as Clisthenes vsed at Athens, seeking to augment the Democracie: and that which they of Cyrene vsed, who established the Popular state: for it is requisite to make sundry other tribes and fraternities, and to reduce the priuate sacrifices to a lesse number, and to make them common, as also to inuent all meanes possible, whereby they may all bee mingled, and to abolish the former familiarities and conuersings together. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Moreouer, the Tyrannicall customes seeme to bee all Popular, as the permission of slaues, which may be in some sort behoofefull, as also of women and children, and to suffer euery man to liue after his owne pleasure, which thing shall much profite such an estate, because the vulgar sort had rather liue disorderly then modestly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are four kinds of Democraties, as hath ben said in the 4. book. cha. 4. The first is of Husbandmen: the second of sheepeheards, &amp; where the citizens liue vpon pasture:
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:7218:188"/>
the third is of tradesmen, and mercenary people: the fourth, where euery one liueth as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> he list himselfe, without respecting or regarding the laws and Magistrats, sith all is ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Tyrannically administred, according to the will and decrees of the people, through the persuasion of their flatterers and leaders. The first kind of Democratie is the best, which consisteth of Husbandmen, who hauing small wealth, are constrained to labor, and haue little leisure to frequent the publicke assemblies, by which meanes the lawes beare rule amongst them. The popular properties of this Democratie are, first, to haue sildome any generall assembly; secondly, that in this generall assembly or great counsel, they haue power to create, and controule or punish Magistrates, and to hear them giue account of their doings, either all together, or some certaine chosen by all; thirdly, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> the greatest and highest Offices be giuen according to the valuation of most wealth &amp; reuenues, and executed by men of sufficiency, full of vertue, knowledge &amp; experience. There are foure Lawes very requisite and profitable for the maintaining and vpholding of such a kind of Democratie: The first, that it bee not lawfull for any one to possesse more land then the measure or quantity allowed by the state: The second, not to sell the first inheritances: The third, to lend no money on any peece of land: The fourth, not to giue whole inheritances to particular persons, but to diuide them by so many parts, that euery one may haue a portion thereof, and may follow Husbandry. The second kind of Democracie, is of those people that liue by the keeping of Cattell, which for the most <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> part consist of sheepeheards, who because they remaine commonly in the open aire, without any couert, liuing simply and poorely, haue both their bodies and mindes har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened to the enduring of military trauailes and troubles: Wherefore such a forme of Commonweale hath the second place of goodnesse amongst the Democracies. The third kind of Democratie is not so good, the people therein being of all sorts, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunts, Artificers, and Mercenary men, who are farre worse then Husbandmen and Sheepeheards, because their employments and actions haue nothing agreeable to ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and because by reason of thier idlenesse they haue leisure to meete and assemble themselues often. Touching the last kind of Democratie, sith it is worse then the rest, it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> hath need to preserue it selfe by sundry meanes, which are reduced to foure. The first is, that the Gouernours admit as many Cittizens as they can, not onely such as are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully borne, but also bastards, or them whose fathers or mothers onely were Cittizens, vntill the multitude of the vulgar sort exceed the number of the Noblemen, and those of meane estate, without passing any further. The second manner is to encrease the number of the Tribes or linages, by making the priuate sacrifices lesse and publicke. The third, to vse all meanes for the entermixing of them together. The fourth is, the liberty of slaues, women, and children, and the suffering of euery one to liue after his owne pleasure, as is vsed in the Tyrannie: for the people is a Tyran.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/>

                  <hi>IT is the office of a Lawgiuer, and euery other person, which vndertaketh the ordaining and establishing of an estate, not to make it great or only, but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> rather that it may bee of continuance, because is no hard thing for any whatsoeuer forme of gouernement to last two or three dayes. It is therefore requisite that wee returne to the discourse which we haue made before tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the preseruations and destructions of Commonweals, and thence ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or frame the safety therof, shanning the causes which destroy them, &amp;
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:7218:188"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> following such lawes, as well written as vnwritten, which doe cheefly containe the meanes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Commonweales are preserued, and not to thinke that it is either a Popular or Oligarchicall thing, which causeth the Citie to liue in a very Popular or very Oligarchicall manner, but that which causeth the stability and continuance thereof. Nowe adaies the Gouernours to please the people, doe make the most part of the goods common, by way of Iustice. But they who haue care of the Commonweale, must doe cleane otherwise, for they must ordaine that the goods of condemned persons bee not made the peoples, nor appropriated to the state, but that they bee adiudged to the vse and seruice of religion. By this meanes men will beware as much of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending, because such punishment is proposed, and the vulgar sort hauing no hope of gaine, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> will not bee so forward to condemne those which are accused. Likewise, publicke accusations must bee alwayes seldome made, by imposing great penalties on false accusers, sith they are not wont to accuse the people, but the Noblemen. Furthermore, it is requisite that all the Citizens wish well to the Commonweale, or at the least that they repute not the gouernours for enemies. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the last kinds of Democracies are greatly peopled, and because also it is very hard to haue generall assemblies, without setting downe some fee or allowance, which thing is dangerous for the Noble and rich men, where there are no publicke reuenues, sith it is necessary to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit exactions and confiscations by false iudgements, whereby many Democracies haue beene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed: Therefore where there are no reuenues, it is good to haue few assemblies, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> many matters in few daies, for that is very profitable, to the end, that the rich men feare not the greatnesse of the charges, if not the rich but the poore haue fees allowed them for iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging. It is also profitable, to the end, that causes may bee the better decided, sith the rich men will not bee long absent from their priuate businesse, but for a small time they are well content to doe it. But when there are publicke reuenues<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> that which the guides and leaders of the people doe now adayes, must bee shanned, for they in taking their part, diuide that which remaines, and haue neede thereof againe, because such an helpe to needy persons, is like a vessell full of holes. And hee that is a true Popular Gouernour, must see that the people bee not too poore, for that maketh the Democracie worse. Wherefore, it is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> necessarie to prouide with great care and diligence, that there may bee such abundance as may continue. And sith the same is also expedient and profitable for the rich men, the money which is made of the publicke reuenues, must bee gathered, and then distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the poore, especiallie if so much money may bee made, as may serue to buy some land; if not, then to helpe them thereby to vse Merchan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Likewise, the Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that are courteous, and haue anie iudgement or vnderstanding, ought to distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute amongst themselues the poore and needie people, furnishing them with meanes whereby they may labour: and it should bee good to imitate the people of the Taren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, which make the vse of their possessions common and equall to the poore, and hereby they get the good will and fauour of the vulgar sort. Besides, they haue deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded all the Magistracies, and will haue some to bee giuen by election, and others <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> by lots: by lots, that all the people may haue equall part therein: by election, that they may bee the better ruled and gouerned.

               <p>
                  <hi>WE shall also hereby perceiue how Oligarchies are to bee ordered. Now euery Oligarchie must be framed of contraries, in respecting the contrary forme of Democracie, cheefly, that which is well tempered, and the first kind, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembleth much the Commonweale, so generally called, where the wealth and reuenues are to be diuided, and the one made lesse, the other greater; lesse, as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> those according to the rate, whereof the necessary Offices are giuen; and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as those according to the rate whereof the cheefe Offices are giuen: and that euery one that hath reuenues, be admitted to the authority of gouernment. Likewise, that the people be thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to receiued, according to the valuation of wealth, in such number, that the gouernours may haue more power then the rest which doe not gouerne. And there must alwaies be associated in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of the Commonweale, some of the better sort of the people. We will in like sort ordaine the Oligarchie following, by stretching and extending it a little: but that kinde of Oligarchie, which is opposite to the extreame kind of Democracie, and which is the most violent and Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> of all Oligarchies, because it is the worst of all, it hath therefore greater neede to haue the safety thereof carefully and warily prouided for. For as bodies of good &amp; healthfull constitution, and shippes well furnished with Marriners, doe beare many faults or imperfections without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; but contrariwise, as sickly bodies, and leaking vessels, or such as haue bad Marriners, cannot beare the least faults, so the worst kinds of Commonweales haue most need to be carefully vpheld. The great number of inhabitants preserueth the Democracies; for it that is opposed to the
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:7218:189"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> right, that is according to worthinesse. But on the other side, the Oligarchie is preserued by good order.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Aristotle hauing purposed to treat in this sixt booke seuerally of Democraties and Oligarchies, after he hath dispatched and finished his discourse touching Democraties, entereth now into the Oligarchies, wherein hee doth insist the lesse, because the one is vnderstood by the other, sith they are contraries: for there are as many kinds of Oligar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies, as there are of Democraties, which are opposed correspondantly each to other, <hi>viz.</hi> the first kind of Oligarchie to the first kind of Democraty, and so the rest. Touching <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the first kind, it is very good, and draweth neere to the Commonweale, so generally cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, that the wealth and reuenues be therein diuided into lesse and greater: lesse, as those whereby men may attaine to necessary Offices: greater, as those according to the rate &amp; valuation, whereof they are chosen, which shall execute supreme and soueraigne Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: wherein such regard is to be had, that the Gouernours haue more power then the rest, and that the better sort of the people, may participate in the gouernment. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and third kind of Oligarchie, are likewise to be established by augmenting the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenues: but the last kind of Oligarchie, correspondent to the last kind of Democratie is most bad and Tyrannicall, which like a sickly body or a shippe at sea ill rigged and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> hath need of greater care for the vpholding and maintaining thereof. Nowe, as Democraties are preserued by the great multitude of people, so are Oligarchies vpheld and continued through good order.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>NOw sith there are four cheefe parts of the people, the Husbandmen, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificers, Merchants, and Hirelings: and foure parts for warre, the Horsemen, Footmen armed, Footmen unarmed, and seafaring men: where the Countrey is fit for Horsemen, there may bee well established a mighty Oligarchie, for the inhabitants may maintaine themselues through this power, and it dooth also belong to men of great wealth to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> keepe horses. Where the countrey is fit for the training vp of footmen, there may be established the second kind of Oligarchie, for the vse of heauie armour is fitter for rich men, then for poore men. But the power of the light armed souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours and seafaring men, is altogether Democraticall. Now a daies where there is a great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of such people, if there arise any sedition, they doe oft fight worse, which euill must be remedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the example of good Captaines, who mingle with the horsemen &amp; footme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that are through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly armed, a sufficient number of light armed men. And in this manner the popular sort doe in seditions ouercome the rich men, because being lightly armed, they doe fight with ease against the horsemen, and well armed footmen. Then by establishing such a power of them, they doe establish <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> it against themselues. But whereas there are two ages, and some are old, others young, children must be instructed and trained vp while they are yet young, in light and easie exercises, and when they shall be past their childhood, they must be enured and hardened to endure labour, as wrast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers. It is requisite to allow the multitude a part in the authoritie of gouernment, either (as it hath ben said before) those which haue reuenues, or as the Thebanes doe when they abs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="5 letters">

Now it is seemely and expedient, that at their entring into office, they make sumptuous sacrifices, and some publicke buildings, that the people being feasted, and seeing the City adorned and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished both with Temples and other buildings, may rest content with such a kind of gouernment.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>or any estate, and what commodious and honourable.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>WE will now intreat of offices, and shew how many there are, and what they be, &amp; of what things they haue charge, as we haue said before. For the City cannot <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> be without necessary Offices, nor be well gouerned without those that concerne the good order and ornament thereof. Moreouer, it is necessary that there bee fewer offices in small Cities, and more in the greater, as hath ben already said. We must not then be ignorant what offices are to be conioined, and what are to be seuered. Of the necessary Offices the first is to haue charge of the market, and thereto must bee appointed an Officer, who may ouersee mens contracts, and to looke that there bee honest dealing among them. For in euery City almost some things must of force be bought, and others sold, for the mutuall and necessary use thereof, and this approchet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> very nigh to that sufficiency, for which they seeme to haue been gathered into the body of one Commonweale. The second charge being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> neere to this, is of publicke and priuate things that concerne the city, to the end, that the houses and streets may be well and decently kept, and such as are fallen to decay, repaired; &amp; the bounds obserued without strife or contention, and all other things, requiring like care. Many doe call such a kind o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> office an Edilitie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> which containeth sundry parts, &amp; in those cities which are much peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled, some are appointed to one charge or part therof, &amp; some to another, as some to the repairing of the wals, others of the conduites, and some to the keeping of the hauens. There is also another necessary charge, and like to this, as consisting in the same things; which neuerthelesse are in the fields without the city, &amp; they which haue the ouersight thereof are called, some of them maisters of the fields, some of the forrests, &amp; so there are three charges of these things. There is another of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> wherto belongs the receiuing of the publick reuenues, &amp; the keeping of the mony that is made therof, as also the disbursing thereof, as the necessity of the state shal require: such officers are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led receiuers and treasur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rs. There is another, which consists in writing priuat contracts, and the sentences pronounced by the iudges, as also sutes, accusations, and actions are to be framed by those which haue this office. But in some cities such offices are diuided among many, who are al reduced vnder the charge of one cheef, &amp; they are called notaries, scriueners, &amp; by other like names. That office which follows next to this, is very necessary, &amp; the most troublesome of all other offices, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting in the executing of iudgements on accused and condemned persons, and in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitting men to prison. This office is little pleasing, by reason of the great enmity which is thereby purchased,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> so that vnlesse there be great gaine to be gotten by it, no man wil vndertake it, or if any do vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it, they wil not deale therein according to the laws, yet it is necessary, because the iudgements giuen on sutes &amp; causes, should be bootlesse &amp; to no purpose, if they were not put in execution, and had effect. For if ciuile societie cannot continue without the vse of iudgements, much lesse can it endure, vnlesse they bee executed. Wherefore, it is better that this Office bee not one, but that there bee sundry thereof in sundry places. It is requisite to diuide after the same
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:7218:190"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> manner the actions and sutes of lawes, as also that seuerall Magistrates do execute seueral mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and that young men doe rather put in execution the causes of young men, and that such as concerne men more in years, condemned by one Magistrat, be executed by another; as that which the Pretor or Prouost of the citie shall haue decreed, to be put in execution by the AEdile, and so ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally those causes executed by one Magistrat which haue beene iudged by another. For sith they that execute them, shall purchase lesse enmity, so much the rather shall they take effect. But if the same Magistrates doe both condemne and execute, they incurre double hatred, and by medling in all matters, they become odious to all men. In many places the iailor and executioner are two seuerall offices, as at Athens that which is called the office of the eleuen. It is therefore better to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> their charge also, and to vse meanes for it by some deuise, sith it is no lesse necessary then any of the former. For good and honest men do greatly shunne this charge, &amp; it cannot be safely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to bad persons, who ought rather to be kept &amp; looked vnto themselues, then to keep others. It is then expedient that they haue a seuerall office, and that they doe not exercise the same office continually, but that the young men where there is any degree or order of young men &amp; keepers, be appointed to these charges one after another. Wherfore we will set those offices first, as being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry necessary, next these, others lesse necessary, but of greater authority, wherein there is required great experience and faithfulnesse: as are those offices which concern the guard and defence of the City, and all those that are ordained and instituted for the warre, and it is necessary both in time <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of peace and warre, that there be some appointed to keepe and looke vnto the wals and gates of the Citie, and to make inquisitions, and to enroll the Citizens. Then ouer all these charges there are in some places more officers ordained, in other fewer, as in smal cities there is one ouer all: such of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers are called Captaines generall, or Cheefetaines of armies. Besides, if there bee horsemen or light armed footmen, or archers, or mariners, offices are sometimes appointed ouer euery of them, whom they cal Admirals or Generals of the Horsemen, or Colonels of the footmen: vnder whome againe there are others as Captaines of gallies and of companies, hauing Centurions, Decurions, and other particular officers vnder them: and they are all comprised vnder the kind of military affair<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s. Such then is the maner of this office, but because the Magistrates, if not all, yet some at <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the least doe deale in publicke affaires, it is therefore needfull that there be another Magistrate, who may reuiew and controule their accounts, and not be employed in any other matters: some cal them controulers or Censors, some maisters of the accounts, others inquisitors, and some againe protectors. But besides all these offices, there is another, and that the cheefest of them, which who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer doe execute, they haue the ouersight of the state, and gouerne the multitude, where the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple dooth beare rule. For it is expedient that there bee some to assemble them, who may haue the cheefe authority. They are in some places called forecounsellors or preconsulters, because they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult before: but where the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ople commands, they are rather called a Senate or counsel. Then there are almost so many offices belonging to the City. There is another charge concerning the seruice <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of the gods, as are Priests and others, to whom is committed the administration of religion, as to haue care of the Temples, to reedifie those that are ruinous or decayed, and to prouide and looke to such other things as are ordained for the honor of the gods: which charge is in some places all one, as in small Cities: sometimes also there are many sorts thereof, and all diuided or distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed from the office of Priesthood, as keepers of the consecrated money, sextons. The other charge next to this, which is seuerally ordained for al publick sacrifices, which are not by the law appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Priests, but concerne the honour of that God which is protector of the Citie, these are named Kings of the sacrifices, or high Bishops, called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Then to repeat this matter, the necessary offices consist almost in these things, in religion, warre, publicke reuenues, expences tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> the market, the Citie, the hauens, and the religion: furthermore in iudgements, contracts, writings, executions, imprisonments, accounts, inquests, controlling of Magistrats, and finally in the Senate or Counsell of the Commonweale. But properly and peculiarly in those Cities that are quiet and wealthy, wherein great care is had of descence or comelinesse, there is appointed a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate for the discipline of women and children, for the obseruing and keeping of the lawes, and for the gouernement of places for exercise: and besides, for gimnasticall and musicall games, and other like shewes. Of these Offices, some doubtlesse are not popular, as that for the discipline of
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:7218:191"/>
women and children. For poore men must of necessity vse their wines and children, as seruants,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> for want of slaues. And whereas there are three sorts of Magistracies, by which the cheefe Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers are chosen, namely, they that looke to the obseruing of the lawes, the Preconsulters, and the Senate or Counsell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> they of the former, haue an Aristocraticall office; the second an Oligarchicall; and the last, which is the Senate or Counsell, is Popular. Thus haue wee breefely handled al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all the publique Offices.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some Offices are necessary, and others honorable: those are necessary which Citties cannot want, and those honorable which serue for the ornament and beautifying ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and some of them belong to ciuile gouernment, others to religion. There are seuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> kinds of Offices, the first necessary Office is of them that are Clearkes of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket: the second of them that haue charge of the publicke and priuate buildings of the City, and they are called Ediles: the third concerneth the same thing in effect, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Cittie: the fourth is of receiuers and treasurers: the fift of Notaries and Scriue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: the sixt of executioners and iailers: all which Offices be very necessary, as bee also those that follow, which are withal of greater authority, wherin there is required much experience and faithfulnesse, as are those Offices which concern the guard and defence of the Citie, and all those that are ordained and instituted for the warre, which wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre to the seuenth kind of Offices, as Captaines, Generals of Armies, Constables,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> leaders of the Horsemen, Colonels of the footmen, Admirals; vnder whose command are sundry other inferiour Officers: the eight is of the Masters of accounts, and control<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of other Offices: the ninth is of those that haue the ouersight of the State, assemble the Counsell, and are therein President; as were the Consuls at Rome, and now in Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer land the Auoyers, Burgmaisters and Amans: the tenth is of the forecounsellers, preconsulters, or procurators, who examine matters, &amp; then propound them to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, as are the Sauij or Sages at Venice, being sixteene in number, and so called, because they seeme to haue a farther insight and iudgement in causes of weight, then all the rest: the eleuenth is of Priests, and others appointed to the seruice of the gods, and the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> administration of religion, as Bishops, Chanons, Curates, Chaunters, and others di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished from the Office of Priesthood, as Wardons, and Sextons, &amp;c. the twelfth of the Kings of the sacrifices, as at Rome, at Lacedemon, and in AEgypt; or of high Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, called <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, as at Athens, to whose charge were committed the publique sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices made in honour of that God who was protector of the City: the thirteenth is of those Officers who are appointed for the discipline of women: the fourteenth for the institution and education of children: the fifteenth of those that looke to the obseruing of the lawes: the sixteenth of such as ouersee the exercises: the seuenteenth concernes the publicke games and shewes.

                  <hi>HE that will vndertake duly to treat of the best Commonweale, ought first of all to declare what life is most to be wished and desired: for if he be ignorant <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> thereof, he must needs be ignorant of the best forme of Commonweale, for it stands with reason that they should liue well, who vse a good forme of Comon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale, according to their commodities, vnlesse there happen some extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Doubtlesse, as touching the diuision al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready set downe, it cannot be denied, but that whereas good be diuided into three parts, namely, into those that are externall, into the goods of the body, and into the goods of the mind; all men <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> cannot be happy, for he shall neuer be accounted happie, that hath not any portion of manhood, nor of temperancie, nor of iustice, nor of wisdome, nor he that is afraid of euery flie, nor hee that being hungry or thirsty refraineth not from the worst things, nor he that for the value of a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will kill his dearest friends, nor likewise he that is sencelesse and without reason, like a child or mad man. Now ought all men confesse these things to be so as we haue declared them: Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse they disagree in the quantity and in the immoderate excesse of them. For how little ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue soeuer they haue, they thinke that sufficient: But their desire is to excell infinitely in riches,

                     </gap>e vnderstanding of the same by reason. For the outward goods haue some end wherefore they are, being as it were instruments: and euery profitable thing is such, that the excesse thereof must needs be hurtfull, or of no profit to him which hath it. But how much soeuer the goods of the mind do abound, so much the more good do they, and therfore are not only honest, but also profitable. To <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> be short, it is certaine that such is the comparison and proportion of the good dispositions, or best states and affections of euery thing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>mongst themselues, as is of the excesse, by which the things themselues doe differ one from another, whereto we account the dispositions to appertaine. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the mind, both as it is absolutely taken without respect of the good which we reape thereby, and as it hath relation to our selues, is of greater honour, and more precious then the possessions of the body, then must the good disposition and best state of euery of these, haue all one the same prop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Moreouer, such goods are naturally to bee desired for the mind, and all wise men ought so to desire them, and not the mind for them: let vs then resolue our selues, that there happeneth as much felicity to euery man, as he possesseth vertue &amp; wisdome,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> and so farre as he worketh according to them; taking example from God who is blessed, not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of any outward good, but in respect only of himselfe, and because hee is of such a kind of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>IT remaineth now to examine whether the happinesse of each particular man &amp; of the City, be all one or not. But this is a manifest thing, because all men do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent that it is all one: for all those which place the good life of each perticular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in richesse, do account the whole city happy which is rich: and the preferrers &amp; fauorers of the tyrannical life, think that city most happy that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeth &amp; ruleth many. And he which commends each perticular person, cheefly in respect of honesty and vertue, will call that city happy which is vertuous. But herein two points are to be considered, the one, what life is to be preferred, whether that which consisteth in the publicke go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, and fellowship of the city; or rather that kind of li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now it appertaines not to the mind and consideration of him which dealeth about ciuile matters, to set down what is to be desired of each perticular person, but what is to be wished for of al men in general: And therfore haue we put forth this question, as peculiar to our methode, leauing the other as being strange. Now therfore that Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monweale must needs be good, by the order whereof euery man may do wel &amp; liue happily, wherin there is no doubt. But there is a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouersie (amongst those which confesse that the vertuous life is to be wished) whether the ciuile &amp; actiue life is more to be desired then that which is seuered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all outward things: as the contemplati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore where there be many lawes made, and dispersed here &amp; there in many places, if they haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to some end, doubtlesse they tend wholly to haue rule and dominion: as at Lacedemon, and in Crete, almost all their whole discipline &amp; multitude of laws, are framed and directed for the wars. Furthermore, this faculty is honored amongst all nations which are able to bring others into sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection, as among the Scithians, Persians, Thracians, &amp; Frenchmen. In some places there be laws made for the incourageme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of this vertue, as at Carthage they honor men with as many rings as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> they haue ben times in the wars. There was in times past a law in Macedon, that those which had not slain some enemy, should weare a girdle of a halter: and amongst the Scythians, it was not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for him which had not slain an enemy to drink of the cup which they caried about and dranke o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now if it
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:7218:193"/>
be so, it is not behoofefull to straine a mans selfe to gouerne all men, but them onely which are fit by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> nature to liue vnder gouernment; as Hunters ought not to take men to be sacrificed and eaten, but wild beasts which are good to eat, and fit for such purposes. Notwithstanding, a Citie may be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py by it selfe, to wit, that Citie which vseth a good forme of gouernment, if it were possible to find some one City inhabited seuerally by it selfe, vsing vertuous lawes, whose order and discipline ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not to the wars, nor to get victory ouer the enemies: for let vs put the case that there were no such thing in it, therefore all martiall exercises are to bee accounted honest, howbeit, not as the last end of all things, but as ordained for the same. The vertuous Lawgiuer ought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to haue consideration of the Citie, and of the kind of men, and of all other societies, howe they shall attaine to that good life and felicitie, which is possible and conuenient for them.

                  <hi>WE will dispute against those which confesse that the life ioined with vertue, is most of all to be desired, and yet disagree about the vse thereof, and will set downe the reasons of either party: some despise the offices of the Commonweale, deeming that the life of a free man differeth from the life of a ciuile gouernour, and howe that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> kind of life is most of all to be wished for: others affirme that the gouernours life is the best, because it is not possible by doing nothing, to do wel; and that well doing and felicity is all one and the selfesame thing. Both of them doe partly say well, and partly not. The one affirme the life of him which is free from such trouble, to be better then his that gouernes: which thing is true, because there is no generositie in vsing a slaue, as he is a slaue; and besides, in the commanding of things necessary, there is no decence or honesty: yet it is an error to think that euery gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is a lordly kind of rule, for the gouernment of free men doth no lesse differ fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that of slaues, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth he which is free by nature from him which is a slaue by nature, whereof we haue sufficiently spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the former discourses: but it is not good to prefer the doing of nothing before labor and emploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> sith happinesse consists in action: besides, the actions of good and iust men haue for their end many good things. This being thus determined, some will thinke that it is very good to bear rule ouer al, sith herby many iust &amp; honest things may be done: so that he who may bear rule ought not to resign his power to another, but rather to take it fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him: &amp; that the father haue no regard of his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their father, nor one friend of another, in this respect: for that which is

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> good is greatly to be desired, and to doe well is good: perhaps they sho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And nothing which is against nature, is honest. If then there were any other better in vertue &amp; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> ability to doe wel, it were honest to yeeld vnto him, and iust to obey him. Now he must not be endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with vertue only, but with power also, by meanes whereof hee may vse action.

For they who preferre the quiet kind of life before the busie kind, &amp; that which is imployed in gouernment, are deceiued in that they think that euery gouernement is a lordly kind of rule; which is properly ouer slaues, far different from that which is ouer free men. In like sort they are deceiued who prefer the busie before the quiet kind of life: in that they suppose that they who are giuen to contemplation, do nothing; because they onely are not to be knowne, who exercise iustice, and the vertues referred to another; but they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> whose nature is contemplatiue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="356" facs="tcp:7218:194"/>
Commonweale, without hauing in some different measure the things which are thereto expedient <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> and needfull. We must therefore presuppose sundry commodities, as it were in wishing for them, whereof neuerthelesse there is none impossible: I meane the multitude of Citizens, and greatnesse of the territory; for euen as other Artificers, as an Embroderer and Shipwright, must haue stuffe meet for their worke, which by how much the better it is, so much the fairer and better that peece of worke will bee which is made thereof, in the like sort, the Gouernour and Lawmaker must haue his proper matter well and conueniently prepared; The first commoditie hereunto requisite, is the multitude of inhabitants, how many, and of what nature they ought to be. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, regard must bee had to the territory, how bigge and what kind of soile it must bee. Many then suppose that an happie and flourishing City should bee great, if this bee true, they know not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> which Citie is great, and which is small, for they iudge it to bee great by reason of the number and multitude of the inhabitants, whereas they should rather respect the power then the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: for there is a certaine duty and worke proper to a Citie, and that Citie which can best per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it ought to bee accounted great, as, you will not say that Hippocrates was a greater man, but a greater Phisition then another man who may exceed him in greatnesse of body: yet if men in iudging the greatnesse of a Citie respect the number of the inhabitants, they must not haue regard to euery multitude of men, because there is of necessity in Cities a great number of slaues and strangers: But they should haue regard to those which are a part thereof, and of whome it consisteth, as of her proper members; for the abundance of these dooth witnesse the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> greatnesse of a Citie: but that Citie which can affoord many Artificers, and fewe Souldiours, cannot b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e great, for there is difference betweene a great, and a populous Citie. And it is knowne by experience to bee very difficult, or rather impossible that a Citie which is too much peopled, can bee well gouerned. Certes, of all the Cities, whose gouernement is accounted good, wee see not any which is too populous. And hereof reason it selfe dooth assure vs, for the lawe is a certaine order, and the good instituting of lawes, is of necessitie good order: But the excessive number of inhabitants is not capable of order. For this should be a worke requiring Gods omnipotent power, which comprehendeth and gouerneth the globe of the whole world. Then sith goodnesse or fairenesse dooth vsually consist in multitude and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> that Citie wherein there is the prescribed proportion of greatnesse, it is doubtlesse the best or fairest. There is also a certaine measure of greatnesse in cities, as in all other things, in liuing creatures, plants and instruments, for each of them being too small, or of excessiue greatnesse, cannot retaine his power, but shall thereby wholly loose his nature, or remaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable: as a shippe of an hand breadth is not in very deed a shippe, nor that also which is of two furlongs, but being come to some greatnesse, either through being too little, or through excessiue highnesse, it will saile ill: in like sort, the Citie which hath few inhabitants, is not sufficient, although a Citie bee a thing sufficient. If it haue too many inhabitants, it shall bee furnished with things necessary as a Nation, not as a Citie, neither is it possible to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> it well. For who could bee the guide and leader of an huge multitude, or a crier, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse hee were like to Stentor? Wherefore that is to bee accounted the cheefest Citie which hath such a number that may suffice first and principally of it selfe to liue well in ciuile societie. And although a Citie may bee greater by exceeding this proportion, yet it is not infinite, as hath been said. It is easie to vnderstand by the effects themselues, what is the tearme or bound of this excesse: for the actions of a Citie are sometimes in commanding, and sometimes in obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The authoritie of commandement and iudgement, is the action of a commander. Nowe, to iudge vprightlie, and to bestow the Magistracies on worthie persons, it is necessarie that the Citizens doe knowe each other, of what estate and qualitie they are: And where <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> this is not done, neither can Offices bee well disposed, nor iudgements well ordered: For it is no reason that they should rashly proceed in either of them, as doubtlesse they doe in a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie which is too populous. Besides, strangers and forriners may easily intrude themselues into the Commonweale, because it is no hard matter to bee hidden in so great and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessiue a multitude. Wee will then conclude, that the good definition of a Citie is a great multitude of inhabitants, hauing sufficient meanes whereby to liue, and a naturall
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:7218:194"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> knowledge of and betweene themselues. Thus wee haue spoken ynough of the greatnesse of a Citie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The former discourses touching a happie life and touching action and contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, haue bene propounded as preparatiues for the better consideration of a good form of gouernement, the foundation whereof is grounded on the abundance of things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, which abundance consisteth in two commodities, the one is the multitude of inhabitants, the other the quantity and quality of the country or territory. An happie Citie should bee neither too great, nor too little: but sith fairenesse consisteth in multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and greatnesse, that City whose proportion is moderate, must needs bee faire and flourishing: which proportion must not bee iudged by the number or multitude of all sorts of inhabitants, as bondmen, soiourners, and strangers resorting thether, but by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting the true and right Citizens, whereof it is composed, as of the proper parts or members: also the ability thereof, for it is not possible to gouerne a Citie well that is too populous, as Caire in AEgypt, Constantinople in Greece, Paris in France, Chambala in Cathaia, Muscho in Muscouia, Fez, Samarcand, Milaine, by reason of the multitude and confusion therein, repugnant to the lawe and to discipline grounded on good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.

                  <hi>WE may say the like of the country, and need not doubt touching the quality ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, but that the best and most praiseworthy by the consent of all men, is that which is furnished with most sufficience, as of necessity that countrey is which is fertile and abundant in all things.

If this which we haue propounded be well said or not, we will hereafter discourse therof, when we come to that place, where we shall fully and at large treat of the purchasing, and of the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of wealth, how and in what manner men should dispose themselues for the vsing thereof: For many doubts arise in this consideration, by reason of those who draw this matter to the one or other excesse of li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Besides, as we said that the multitude of inhabitants in a City, should bee no greater, then that they might easily know each other, there is the like reason touching the country. And to be easily knowne is nothing els then to be of such a scituation; that it may easily be succou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. If we should constitute or establish a Citie according to our owne desire and wish, We would <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> seat it in a place which should be commodious by sea and land.

               <p>
                  <hi>TOuching trafficke by sea, whether it bee profitable or hurtfull to well go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned Cities, there are many doubts: for some affirme that it is very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious to the good discipline of a City, that strangers trained vp in other lawes, resort thether: and that to people it much by the trafficke of the sea, in sending forth and receiuing into the City a multitude of Merchants, it is against the ordinance and institution of a good gouernement. But if <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> these inconueniences bee auoided, there is no doubt that it is better both for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>afety and abundance of all necessaries, that a City or Countrey bee neare the sea. For to resist the enemy, the inhabitants for the full assurance of their owne safety, must be able to haue succour easily conueyed vnto them from all parts, as well by sea as by land, that if it be not possible to hurt the enemies both waies when they assaile them, yet at the least they may the more offend them by the one or the other, hauing both. Besides, they may furnish themselues with such necessaries as they want, and send out those whereof they haue abundant store: for a City must vse trafficke and Merchandise for it selfe, and not for others. And they which keepe open marts for al the world to repaire to, doe it to gaine thereby. If such couetous desire beseeme not a City, neither also dooth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> the keeping of such marts beseeme it. But sith we see at this present in many Countries, harbors &amp; hauens lying commodiously neare the City, in such sort, that they are not within it nor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Touching power by sea, there needes no doubt to bee made, but that it is good to bee furnished therewith according to a certaine quantity, for it is not requisite and behoofeful for the Cities selfe onely, but also for some bordering friends, to bee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The number and greatnesse of this sorce must bee according to the state and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> manners of the City. For if it flourish, and be as a Princesse and commandresse of others, it must of necessitie haue this power proportionable to the actions thereof. Neuerthelesse, it is not needful that there bee in Cities great store of seafaring men, neither is it meet, that such men bee a part thereof. For they which are employed as chee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But if there be great store of peasants and husbandmen dwelling neere, there wil neuer be any lacke of Marriners, which thing we see at this present in some places, as at Heraclea, where they haue their gallies furnished, although their City be lesse then many others.

For those Nations which inhabite cold places, and in Europe, are full of courage, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> but haue no sharpenesse of wit, nor cunning; for which cause they do the longer continue in libertie: but they are without any good forme of gouernement, &amp; cannot beare rule ouer their neighbours. They of Asia are wittie, and more apt to the learning and practising of arts, but they are not so couragious, and are therefore subiect, and doe serue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually. The Greeke Nation as it is in the middest betweene these two places, so doth it partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate of both, being couragious and ingenious, for which cause it dooth continue and keepe her li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, and is well gouerned, and might command the whole world, if it had but one manner of gouernment. The people of Greece haue the same difference betweene them, sith some of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue one onely nature, and others are well disposed to both qualities.

The signe hereof is, that a mans mind is more prouoked against his famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars and friends, then against vnknowne or strange persons, when he thinkes himselfe to bee despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by them. Wherefore the Poet Archilechus, accusing his friends, dooth very fitly speake thus to his mind, Art thou not tormented by thy friends?

Yet it is not well said that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> they should be rough towards those whom they know not, because they ought not to bee so towards any person, neither are magnanimious men rough by nature, saue only towards those which iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry them.

But the Meridionall or Southerne people, who are in the second and third climate, through the excessiue heat thereof haue commonly sharper wits, but smaller cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage: and they that inhabite the farthest parts of the North, by reason of the exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue cold and abundance of blood, are very couragious, but of small wit and prudence. Aristotle sayth the like in his little Treatise <hi>De sensu &amp; sensibili,</hi> and in the foureteenth Section of his problemes. Plato in the <hi>Epinomide</hi> doth write in like sort of Greece, and of the Grecians; and in Timeus, of the Countrey of Attica, and the Athenians. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> Hippocrates in his worke of the Aire, Waters, and Places, dooth vse the like dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course touching the parts of the habitable world, affirming that the people of Asia are such as they are here described. Galen likewise doth very learnedly examine this point in that little worke, wherein hee proueth that the motions of the mind, doe follow the temperature of the body: and it seemeth that Aristotle hath borrowed this discourse of Hippocrates and Plato. Marcus Varro in his first booke <hi>De re rustica</hi> is of the same opinion, praising his Countrey Italy, as Aristotle doth Greece; and hee alledgeth Era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tosthenes, who diuided the whole world into two parts, <hi>viz.</hi> the North and South, from which proceedeth all that diuersity of things which we see, according to the neerenesse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> or distance of the sunne.</p>

And herein both all liuing creatures, and those things that growe on the ground, are found to agree.

The sharpenesse of their Winter is hereunto correspondent, as also the greatnesse of those thinges that growe on the ground, and the fiercenesse of the beastes: wee doe generally call them Scythians. As for them that inhabite the Countries scituate betweene the Summer tropicke, and the North, because the sunne goeth not ouer their Zenith, yet runneth not too farre from it towards the South, they liue in a very temperate air, wherein there are small differences of heat and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> cold, they are therefore of meane heat and stature, and of a temperate nature, dwelling neere together, and being of mild and gentle manners. And they who are neerer to the South, are more ingenious and aduised in their actions, and are commonly more skilful in matters that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cern the state &amp; motions of the heauenly bodies, because their vertical point is neerer to the Zodiake, &amp; to the wandring stars which are vnder it, by the neere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse wherof they haue their minds prompt and readie to conceiue and search out arts,

Likewise, the Easterne people are more vigorous and sound of conceit, keeping close nothing: for we doe truly say that the East is of the suns nature, and therefore that part of the day is to bee accounted more manly and dextrall. We see also in liuing creatures, that the right sides are stronger. Contrariwise, the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterne people are more effeminate, soft, and giuen to secrecie: for that part belongeth to the Moone, which doth alwaies shew herselfe towards the West betweene the interlu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nar spaces, and for this cause as nocturnall and sinistral, she is accounted opposite to the East.

By Iupiter it is no small enterprise, yet we must not feare, but doe what we can. ADIM. No certes. SOCR. Thinke you that a generous dogge differeth in nature from a generous young man, in as much as concernes this dutie of defence and watchfulnesse? ADIM. What say you? SOCR. Both of them should haue a good sent, bee swift to follow that which they haue found by their sent, and strong to fight when they shall haue ouertaken it, as need shall require. ADIM. It is necessary that they haue all this, and besides be couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, if they meane to fight well. SOCR. Why not? Hee that is thus hardy, will hee not bee cholericke, bee it horse, or dogge, or any other beast? Or doe you not know that the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> passion of anger is inexpugnable and inuincible, making the mind fearelesse, and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vntamed, when it is present? ADIM. I know it well. SOCR. Then it is manifest what manner of body such a person should haue. ADIM. Yea certes. SOCR. And that his mind should be enclined to choler. ADIM. It is so. SOCR. But tell mee Glaucon, shall not they hauing such a nature be sharp and rough among themselues, and towards the other Citizens? ADIM. Not easily. SOCR. They ought to be gentle to their owne, but rough to the enemies: Otherwise they will not tarry till others destroy them, but they wil destroy themselues. ADIM. Yea verily. SOCR. What shal we doe then? Where shall we find a gentle and chollericke nature together? For the gentle nature is in some <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> sort contrary to the cholericke. ADIM. It seemeth so. SOCR. But whosoeuer shall want either of these, cannot bee a meete person for this place, and it seemeth impossible that these two natures can bee ioyned together, whereupon it followeth, that there cannot be had any such a one as we require. ADIM. I beleeue it. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (quoth Socrates) thinking on the aforesaid discourse, we haue reason to doubt, for wee haue straied farre from the similitude that was propounded. ADIM.

This is seene in other creatures, but cheefely in this, wherewith wee compare ours. For you know, that the nature of a generous dogge is to bee gentle towards those <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> whom he doth familiarily know, and cleane contrary towards those whom he knoweth not. ADIM. I know it. SOCR. Then it was possible, and not against nature, to find for this purpose such a one as we sought. ADIM. It was not against nature.</p>

In like sort, although the Citie haue need of riches, yet riches are not any part of the City. And there are many liuing things which are parts of riches: but the Citie is a certaine company or society of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> such as are like, whose end lead the best kind of life that is possible. Then sith felicitie is the cheefe and soueraigne good, and sith it is an action and a certaine perfect vse of vertue, wherein some do sufficiently participate, others little or nothing at all; doubtlesse that doth cause the seuerall kinds and differences of a Citie, and the sundry formes of commonweale: for sith euery one aimes at this diuersly, and by diuerse meanes, hereby it commeth to passe, that the manners of mens liues, and that Commonweales doe differ. We see then how many things there are, without which a city can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, because thererein are of necessity comprised the parts, wherof we say that a city consisteth: And because my saying may bee the better vnderstood, I will set downe the number of a Cities actions: first therefore it must haue victuals; next it must haue Trades, sith mans life hath need of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> many instruments; thirdly armour, because it is necessary that the citizens be furnished therwith as well for the safetie of their estate and chastising of rebels, as for their defence against the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts and enterprises of strangers; besides, there must be some store of wealth and money, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Citie may helpe it selfe both in domesticall occasions, and in the warres; the fift and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall thing is the obseruance of religion, which is called Priesthood; the sixt thing in number, &amp; the most necessary of al, consists in the administration of iustice, touching the commodities and rights betweene them. These are the actions requisite in all Cities: for a Citie is not euery kind of multitude, but such a kind as is of it selfe sufficient to liue in good estate, as we said before. And if any of these things want, such a society hath no absolute sufficience in it self. Then sith a City stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> by these actions, there must of necessity bee therein Husbandmen to prepare and furnish the Citie with victuals, tradesmen, souldiours, rich men, Priests, and Iudges of things necessary and profitable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this Chapter and that which followeth, he speaketh of the parts of a Cittie, what they are, and howe the exercises thereof may bee communicated, according to the diuersitie of gouernements and ages. There are then about sixe actions, without which no City can be. First it must haue victuals, wherewith the husbandmen and shepheards doe furnish it: secondly many trades and handicrafts: thirdly, armor as well to defend it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> self, against subiects that rebel, as against strangers that may inuade or assault it: fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, abundance of wealth and money to employ in publicke and military affaires: the fift action, is the obseruance of religion and maintainance of seruice and worship of the gods, which is committed to the Priests: the sixt and most necessary of all, consisteth in
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:7218:197"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> iudging, which charge is double, the one assigned to the Iudges of ciuile and criminall causes, the other to Senatours and Counsellours of Estate. These are the actions ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding necessarie, for the constituting and maintainance of euery Cittie: without which it cannot bee, nor consequently without those that doe them: Namely, Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen, Sheepeheards, Artificers, Souldiours, Rich men, Priests, Iudges, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors of Estate.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>THese things being determined, we are yet farther to consider whether they ought all to be communicated to all: For it may so happen, that the same <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> persons shall be all both Husbandmen and Artificers, and Counsellors and Iudges: or whether each of these aforesaid charges is to bee giuen se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerally, or whether some are of necessity peculiar, others common, yet not in euery Commonweale, as wee haue said. For it may be that all men doe participate in all things, and that al do not participate in all things, but some in some, from whence proceedeth the diuersity of Commonweales: for in Democracies all doe participate in all things, in Oligarchies not so. But sith wee nowe discourse of the good forme of Commonweale which may cheefly make a Citie happy, and sith it is impossible that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse can be without vertue, (as hath been said) certainely in that City which is wel gouerned, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and which hath men that are iust in very deed, and not by supposition, the Citizens ought not to liue by mechanicall arts, because such a kind of life is base and contrary to vertue; neither ought they also to be Husbandmen, because rest is required for the attaining of vertue, and for the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement of the Commonweale. And sith they likewise which are appointed and employed in the warres, bee therein required, as also they which consult of things profitable, and iudge of things iust or vniust, which seeme <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o be the principall parts of the City, Whether these charges ought to be diuerse, or whether both may be committed to the same persons. They may doubtlesse in some sort bee committed to the same persons, and in some sort to sundry persons: for in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that either charge requires a diuerse vigour of age, and that the one hath need of wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the other of strength, they should bee committed to sundry persons: but in regard that it is impossible that they who can vse violence and prohibite them, will alwaies endure subiection, they should be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to the same persons: for it is in their power which manage armes, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue or not continue that form of gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t wherby the state is ruled. It rests therfore that the Commonweale be committed to both, not at the same time, but as Nature hath ordained, which giueth strength to yong men, and wisedome vnto those which are elder. It is iust and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to distribute them after this manner vnto both: For this distribution is according to worthinesse. Besides, whereas wealth and possessions are necessarie for Citizens, and such on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as haue them, are true and right Citizens, it followes by necessitie that they ought to be rich. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> For handicraftsmen or anie other sort of people, whose actions swarue from vertue, are no part of the Citie, which thing is manifest by the supposition that wee made before, because felicitie must needs bee ioined with vertue, neither ought wee to call a Citie happie, respecting any part thereof, but hauing regard to all the Citizens. It is likewise manifest that the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions must belong to them, sith the Husbandmen are either slaues, or barb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rous people, or such of the peasants as dwell thereabout. There rests yet to speake of, among the charges by vs recited, the Priests charge, whose institution is manifest. For sith the Citizens ought to
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:7218:198"/>
honour the gods, certes they are not to make any Husbandman or Artificer a Priest: and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> also the Citizens are diuided into two sorts, namely of those which are employed in the warres, and of Counsellors, and sith it is meet that the gods be honoured, and that they who haue long la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured, may in the end liue at rest and quiet, the office of Priesthood is to be bestowed on such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. We haue declared those things, without which a Citie cannot stand, as also how many parts there are in a City: for although Husbandmen, Artificers, and all sorts of mercenary people bee thereto needfull, yet the warriors and Counsellors are parts thereof, and each of them is separate, the one alwaies, the other by turnes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The necessary actions of euerie Cittie being declared, it is demanded whether they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> may all bee exercised by all sorts of Cittizens, as in the Democracies: or some by some, and other by others; as in the Oligarchies the rich men exercise Merchandise, Armes, the Offices of Priesthood and iudging, &amp; the poor men do by their toile furnish the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie with victuals, and vse trades. It is resolued and concluded, that in a good Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale, Artificers, Merchants, and Husbandmen, cannot be true Citizens; the exercising of which professions are either base or too laborious: but the Warriours, Counsellors, Iudges, and Priests, are the true parts of a Citty: and the charges thereof may bee well committed to honest Cittizens, and to the same persons in diuerse ages, according to the order of nature, which giueth strength to young men, whereby they are fit for war,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> and wisedome to ancient men, and greater knowledge to iudge and consult. Touching the dignities of religion, it is meet to bestow them on those of the elder sort, that they may in their old yeares rest and repose themselues after they haue passed through the seuerall charges of gouernement, and haue long time laboured and taken great paines. Besides, wealth, possessions, and money, should bee in such persons hands that are rich, and constitute the cheefe parts of a City; sith slaues, barbarous people, or such peasants as dwell neere thereabout, doe vse Husbandry.</p>

                  <hi>THis seemeth no new thing nor lately come to the knowledge of those which haue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> discoursed and written of gouernement, that the Citie should bee diuided by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> orders of exercises, and that they who are employed in the warres, should not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> be Husbandmen. For this manner is yet obserued in AEgypt, and in Crete, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing been ordained in AEgypt by Sesostris, (as men say) and in Crete by Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos. Likewise, the manner of eating publickely together, seemes to bee very auncient, and to haue beene obserued in Crete since the raigne of Minos, and in Italie long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. For they who know the Countrey, say that Italus was king of Oenotria, of whom that people tooke the name, and in stead of Oenotrians were called Italians. Wherevpon that coast of Europe betweene the straight of Sicile and the Lametique gulfe (which are distant each from other halfe a daies iourney) was named Italie. Now they affirme, that this Italus caused the Oenotrians, of wandring Sheepeheards to become Husbandmen, and that among other lawes which hee gaue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> them, he did first institute that manner of dieting together, and that euen at this present some that are descended from him, doe vse it, with certaine lawes of his which they haue receiued. The Opicians dwelt towards the Tyrrhene coast, and were in auncient time, and are yet at this present called A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> here begun, and the diuision of the Citizens by kinds, was first vsed in AEgypt. For Sesostris raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned long before Minos. Perhaps it is to be beleeued, that many other things haue in length of time been oft inuented, or rather infinitely.

                     </gap>ented, and to assay the supplying of whatsoeuer shall want. We haue shewed before that the Countrey ought to be in their hands who manage armes, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and in theirs which gouerne the Estate, and why the Husbandmen should be distinguished from them, as also of what quantitie and qualitie the region should bee. First wee wil speake of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction or separation, and shew what kind of people Husbandmen should be. We find it not good that the possessions should be common, as some would haue them, but we like wel that the vse ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of be common by way of courtesie, and that no Citizen want sustenance. All men agree, that the manner of dieting together is profitable for well ordered Commonweales, we will afterward shew for what cause we doe likewise thinke so. Now it is requisite that all the Citizens bee thereto ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, although it be no easie matter for poore men to contribute out of their owne substance the portion which is set downe, and maintaine their other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>amily. Besides, the charges which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> for the seruice of the gods, are common to all the Citie. It is therefore necessary to diuide the country, into two parts, and to assigne the one part to the publicke vse of the state, the other to priuate persons: and to diuide either of them againe into two, so that one part of the publick reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues be imploied on the seruice of the gods, and the other laid out in defraying the expences which grow by their dieting together: and that likewise of the priuate, one part lie on the frontiers, and the other neare the City, to the end, that each of them hauing two lots distributed vnto him, they may all haue part in both places. By this meanes they shall enioy equal right, and shal better agree if there arise any warre against their neighbours or borderers. And where this manner of diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is not obserued, there doth the one part little care for the enmity of any neighbour state, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the other feares it too much. For which cause in some places there is a statute, that such as dwell neere the frontiers, may not be admitted to counsel, when consultation is to be had about the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>

                     </gap>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler interest. It is therefore expedient to diuide the country in this maner, for the reasons afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said. If it might be according to my desire and wish, I would haue the husbandmen to be slaues, not all of one nation, nor too courageous; for by this means they wil be meeter for labour, and lesse sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected of attempting any innouation. secondly, I would haue them to be some of the barbarous peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple which dwell round about, being of like nature with the former, and that some should peculiarly belong to those which hold and inioy the possessions in particular, &amp; that others should be appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to labor in that part which is publicke. We will afterward shew how slaues are to bee vsed, and why it is better to propose libertie for a reward vnto all.</hi>

And this manner of distributing the multitude or vulgar sort of Citizens by kinds and orders of different exercises, is very ancient, which the AEgyptians did long time vse, who gloried <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> that they were the ancientest people of all the world, (as it appeareth by the beginning of Platoes Timeus) hauing receiued this said manner of distributing from Sesostris, who ordained it first in AEgypt, from whence it came afterward into Crete, at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent also is vsed at Caire, &amp; Fez (as Iohn Leon writeth) and in many great Cities of Asia and Affricke. Others suppose, that the manner which is vsed at Paris, is more seemely &amp; commodious, where Tradesmen and Artificers are intermingled. The Citizens being thus diuided, as it hath been said, by kinds, and separated in their exercises, should diet

Now the Citie onely should not bee diuided in such manner, but the Countrey also is to bee diuided into two parts, the one publicke, the other priuate. And againe each of the two parts must be deuided into two other, so that one part of the publicke is to bee appointed for the defraying of charges that grow aforesaid, meetings and dieting togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, (which are necessarie for euery well ordered Commonweale) the other, for the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of the gods, and matters of religion.

As touching husbandmen Aristotle according to the ancient manner of Greece doth wish, that (to the end they should be more meet for labour, and lesse prone to rebellion) they were slaues, of diuers Nations, not too couragious, to whom libertie should bee proposed for their reward; or else that they should be strangers who might dwell scatteringly about the Country, and hirelings of like nature to slaues, and that some of them should peculiarly belong to those that hold the possessions in particular, and the rest appointed to labour in that part which is publicke.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>

The like doe their Sheepheards, Hunters, and Husbandmen. Diodorus Siculus in his first booke, the eight chapter. The policie of the AEgiptians consists in three sorts of people, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly husbandmen, shepheards, and artificers: The husbandmen taking small wages of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> priests and noblemen, do from their youth continually al their life time follow husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry, by which meanes they become farre better and skilfuller therein then the people of any other country, both because they haue learned it of their fathers and ancestors, and also by reason of their continual vse and experience, so that they know better then any other men the natures of soiles, the seasons fit for watring and sowing, and the manner how to gather and keepe graines and fruits, as wel by the obseruation of their ancestors as by their own care &amp; diligence. In like sort the shepheards hauing learned also of their ancestors how to driue, feed, and keep their cattel, continue alwaies that manner of life, being greatly furthered, both by that which their said ancestors haue fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d out touching <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> pasturage, and other no lesse necessary matters therunto belonging, &amp; by such things as some among themselues haue by their diligence &amp; study obserued: For they that keepe geese and other housebirds, do take therein such care and paines, that beside the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon nature which those birds haue with others that are kept elsewhere, they make a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful increase therof, because they let not the said birds hatch their own egs, but taking the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from them, they do themselues by such means as they haue inuented, reare vp the yong ones, far otherwise then in other countries men are wont to do. Touching arts &amp; trades, we see that in AEgypt all kinds of works are maruellously wel made, &amp; come as it were to their perfection: For the artificers and workmen in AEgypt do imploy the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues in those <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> works only which are permitted by the laws or which they haue learned of their fathers, not troubling the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues with matters of the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monweale, so that neither the dislike or hate of the teacher, nor ciuile discord, nor any other thing whatsoeuer can hinder the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their exercise. In other cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tries euery tradesma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may leaue his first estate to take another, and to follow some of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> husbandry, others merchandise, &amp; others sundry occupations: yea some of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wil oft repaire to publicke assemblies, which are vsed in Cities, gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

But in AEgypt, if an Artificer entermeddle in the affaires of the Commonweale, or vse many trades, he is greeuously punished: Finally, the same custome and institution in publicke and priuate matters hath beene anciently obserued by the AEgyptians, which their ancestors left vnto them.</p>

And they haue this portion allowed them, as well for the ordering and offering of sacrifices, as for their necessary sustenance; for the AEgyptians thinke, that they ought not to neglect, much lesse omit the seruice and reuerence due to the gods, or that the ministers and officers employed in the affaires of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the Commonweale, should want maintenance. These Prelates giue attendance about the Kings to aduise and counsell them in matters of great weight, foretelling things to come through the knowledge that they haue, as wel by the starres, as by their sacrifices, and report out of their holy bookes such things as haue come to passe in former times, that the Kings may thereby know what is expedient and profitable for them: and they are not (as in Greece) one man or one woman onely appointed to keep the consecrated things, but many of them are as it were dedicated and emplo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The third part and portion is receiued by the Gentlemen, and others appointed to serue in the wars, wherein through continual vse and exercise they are skilfull, and by reason of this pay that they receiue, are the more readie and forward to vndertake whatsoeuer dangerous enterprises: for it were against reason, that they who are whollie bent and emploied in the defence of the people safetie, should receiue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> no allowance nor profite of their Countrie, for which they fight. There is yet besides another far greater profit herein, for they being hereby more enriched, are the willin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to procreate children, and to leaue issue behind them, so that the countrie being by this meanes well peopled, hath no need of forraine souldiors, and the children hauing receiued from their fathers the knowledge of all things that concern warfare<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Plato in the third and sixt booke of his Lawes affirmeth, that the knowledge of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> gouernment began when cities were begun, and the institutions and ordinances there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of when mankind was multiplied: and hee thinketh that in an inestimable, and as it were infinit length of time, innumerable cities haue ben built and destroied, &amp; that they haue sometimes of little ones become great, and of great ones little; sometimes of good bad, and contrariwise of bad good. So Aristotle who thought the world was eternall, &amp; Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which said that it had a beginning, but that it should neuer perish; haue affirmed that the same things in kind, haue ben infinitely, and that they should infinitly remaine, that there is nothing the like wherof hath not ben, that there should bee nothing which had not been before, and that there had been nothing that should not be againe afterward:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> which vicissitude or successiue change being continuall and perpetual, must be referred to the mouings of the celestiall bodies, and to their powers: whereto Plutarch agreeth, writing thus in the beginning of Sertorius his life. It is not perhaps (saith hee) a thing to be meruailed at, that in infinite space of time, euen as fortune doth diuersly turne and change, it doth happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> through the casuall meeting of accidents that are altogither like.

               <head>CHAP. XI. Of the scituation of a Citie, and of foure things.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>WE haue shewed before, that a City should be seated in the most co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modious place that may be, both by land and sea, and in respect of the whole Countrey. Touching the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> situation thereof referred vnto it selfe, we are to wish it such, that regard may bee had to foure things. First to the East, as being a thing very necessary, for those Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are most healthful which are set towards the East, and towards the winds that blow from thence. Secondly, to the North for coolenesse. Touching the rest, it must bee ordered, that the situation of the Citie be accommodated to the actions both of peace and warre: of warre, that the Citizens may issue and make salies with ease, and the enemies not approch nor besiege it without great paine and trouble: But that aboue all things it be wel furnished with wels and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, but if this cannot be, they must haue recourse to the remedy thereof which hath ben in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times found out, which is, to haue great cesternes able to receiue and hold abundance of raine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> so that they may haue no want thereof, if they be besieged &amp; depriued by warre of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of the country. But because it is necessary to prouide for the inhabitants health, which consisteth cheefly in the situation, that the city be seated in such a place, &amp; haue such a prospect, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly in vsing good &amp; wholsome waters, great diligence in herein required: for the things which we do oft and much vse about our bodies, do greatly further our health: sith then the vertue of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and winds is of such a nature, it is very expedient in well gouerned Cities, where the waters are not all alike, and where is no store of conduites to diuide them, that those waters which are good to drink, may be separated from those which serue for other vses. Touching strong places, they are not in like sort profitable to all estates; high built fortresses are good for Oligarchies and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Monarchies: equall and euen places for Democracies: and neither of both for Aristocracies, but rather it is requisite to haue in such a state many strong places. Touching priuat houses, that form is held to be most pleasant and meet for other respects, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are well framed and built af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>er the modern fashion, deuised by Hippodamus: But for the greater surety in war, it shal be better to haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> built after a contrary maner, and as they were in ancient times, because by this meanes stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers cannot without difficulty and danger come vnto them, nor the assailants being once entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled, wind themselues out. It shall therfore be good to vse therein both these formes, which thing may be done, if we dispose them as husbandmen do the arbor of their vines, and make not all the city penetrable, but in certain parts and places, as it shal be requisit for the safety and beautifying <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> therof. Touching the wals, they who affirm that the cities which honor &amp; imbrace vertue, should not vse any, speak very simply, and after the ancient maner, &amp; do plainly see that experience hath controlled the error of those cities which did therein glory and boast. I grant that there is no honor in defending the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues by the help of their wals against those which are either like, or do not much exceed them in number: but because it is possible, and sometimes it doth so fal out, that humane prowesse, and the valor of a few persons cannot resist the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; if they wil saue themselues, &amp; not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroied nor outraged, they must hold the strength of wals to be most assured and profitable for war, especially at this time wherein so many engines for the assaulting of besieged places haue ben deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. For not to enclose cities with wals, is as much as to lay open the country to the roades and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uasions <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> of the enemies, and to pull down and lay leuell the highest places, or as much as not to wal priuat houses, least they which dwel therein, should become cowards. We are not likewise ignorant that the inhabitants of those cities which are inclosed with wals may vse them in two manners, both as if they had wals, and as if they had none: which thing those Cities which are vnwalled, cannot do. If this be so, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should the wals not only be built round about them, but also such order be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they may serue both for an ornament to the city, &amp; for the necessary occasions of war, as wel against other subtleties, as against these moderne deuises. For as the assailants doe by all

               <p>In chusing a place fit for the building of a City, regard must be had to the scituation thereof, that it may stand commodiously by land and sea, to the wholesomenesse of the aire, to the wind that commeth from towards the Sunne, and cheefely to the Easterly next to the Northerly winds: likewise to the suretie of the place, that it may not be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily besieged, but that the approch thereunto be painefull to the enemies, and the salies or issues easie for the Citizens: whereof he hath alreadie spoken in the fift and sixt chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> of this booke: but aboue all things that it be wel furnished within with running and wholesome waters, which greatly further health, or at the least with cesternes, therein to keepe the raine water. See Hippocrates in his Treatise of the Aire, of Waters, and of Places: Plato in the sixt of his Lawes: Vitruuius in his eight booke <hi>de Architectura.</hi> Touching places of strength, they are not in like sort fit for all Estates: but for Oligar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies and Monarchies, those that are built high: for Democracies, equality and euen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: and for Aristocracies many places well fortified. Aristotle writeth of the building of priuate houses, according to the auncient forme of Greece, which is declared by Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truuius in his sixt book, the tenth Chapter. The Citie must likewise be compassed with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> strong wals, bulwarkes, trenches, and rampires to resist warlike engines, which were many and terrible while he liued, but more ingenious and violent in these our times, as is artillary, which more then a thousand fiue hundred years since, was found out in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, the vse wherof is come now to such perfection, that nothing can withstand it.

It seemeth then that these things should be thus ordained. The Temples consecrated to the gods, &amp; the places where the cheefe feasts of the Magistrates are kept, should haue a conuenient, and the selfesame place alwaies; reseruing holy places that bee seuered by the law, or if there be any oracle. Such will this place be, if it haue such excellencie, and stand so much aboue others as is fit for the seat of vertue, and be stronger then those parts of the city which be next vnto it: &amp; it is expedient to make about it such a publick place, void of buildings, as is called in Thessalie the Free place: In which place there is no buying and selling of wares, whither no craftsmen, Husbandmen, nor such like doe repaire, except they be called by the Magistrates. The publicke place also shall bee beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> and pleasant, if there bee exercises appointed there for old men. It is conuenient to deuide this ornament according to ages, and to cause the Magistrats to be amongst the young men, and the old men amongst the Magistrates. For the presence of the Magistrates before their eies, doth breed a right shamefastnesse, and honest feare. The market ought to bee seuered from the publicke place, in a place conuenient for the conueying and bringing of all things that come by sea, and by land.

This place is very needfull about the publicke place, which wee would haue to be void of buildings, and this to serue for necessary actions. It is conuenient to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue this order in the Countrey, and to set vp for the Magistrates, whome they call keepers of the woods and forrests, and gouernours of the Countries, some forts and places to eat in, seruing for defence.

               <head>CHAP. XIII. Of felicity, and the meanes to attaine thereunto, and how men wexe vertuous by three things.</head>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
                  <hi>BVt let vs returne to our discourse touching the Commonweale, and declare whereof, and of what manner of things that Citie should bee founded and compacted, which is happy and wel gouerned. There be two points wherein euery kind of goodnesse consisteth: The one, that the intent and the end wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore actions are enterprised, be vprightly grounded and ordained: the other, that the meanes of attaining thereunto bee found out. For these things may agree and disagree amongst themselues, seeing that now and then the scope and end is well laid &amp; proposed, but there is an error and ouersight in the meanes of attaining thereunto; and contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, it may fall out, that the meanes are good, but the proposed end naught. Sometimes, each of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> them is naught worth, as in Phisick oftentimes they iudge not aright, what maner a one a health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full bodie should be, neither direct their care to that end which they haue propounded. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that, in all Arts and Sciences these two things must needs bee, to wit, the end, and the meanes of attaining to the end and purpose. Nowe it is a most cleare case, that all men desire to liue well and to obtaine blisfulnesse and welfare: howbeit, some are able, and other want meanes so to doe, either by reason of some kind of fortune, or by nature: for a good and blessed life requireth some helpe, yet lesse in them which are of good nature and well disposed; and greater in them which are of an euill nature, and euil disposed. Others at the beginning seeke not felicity aright, although they are furnished with meanes which may lead thereto. Sith therefore our intent is to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> see what is the good Commonweale, (which is that whereby the Citie is well gouerned, and the Citie is then well gouerned, when it cheefely happeneth to bee blessed) doubtlesse men should not bee ignorant what felicitie is: Whereof we haue treated in our Ethickes, if any good may bee reaped of those bookes; and haue declared, that felicity is an action and perfect practise of vertu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>; not by way of supposition, but simply and absolutely: I meane by supposition, the things which bee necessary; and by simply, the things which are honest: as iust paines and punishments proceed from vertue, yet neuerthelesse bee necessarie, and necessity maketh them honest: for it were better that
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:7218:202"/>
men and Cities had neuer need of such things. But the actions which concerne honour and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> of wealth, are absolutely honest: for the one riddeth away euill, and such actions contrariwise are preparatiues and workers of welfare. Now although the vertuous man doe constantly suffer pouertie and sickenesse, and other calamities, yet notwithstanding happinesse consisteth in contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie things. For the vertuous man (as we haue declared in the Ethickes) is he which by meanes of vertue possesseth such goods as are absolutely good. Therefore it must then follow, that of necessity his vse of them is vertuous, and absolutely honest. Therefore men thinke that outward wealth is the cause of happinesse. In like sort, as if a man should thinke, concerning good playing vpon an Harpe, that rather the instrument then skilfulnesse were the cause thereof. Wherfore of the things aboue touched, some ought to be had aforehand, and othersome to be prepared by the Lawgiuer.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> For which cause when we lay the foundation of a Citie, the fauour of fortune is to be wished about those things which depend of her, and whereof we account her mistresse. But as for the making of a Citie vertuous, it is not the worke of fortune, but rather of science and election. Now the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is vertuous, when the Citizens that be members and partakers of the Commonweale bee ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, and in mine opinion all Citizens are pertakers and members of the Commonweale. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let vs examine how men become vertuous. For if all men could be vertuous together, so as it were not needfull for euery Citizen perticularly to be vertuous, that were most to be desired, because then all men could not be vertuous, but euery one must be so to. Now men become good &amp; vertuous by three things, to wit, Nature, Custome, and Reason. For first one must be borne, as to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> be a man, and not some other creature: then must be haue some disposition, according to the body and the soule. There be some things which is not sufficient for one to haue by nature, because they alter by custome; other some of a variable nature, and through custome wexe one while worse, and another while better. Therfore other wights liue more according to nature, &amp; few there be which liue by customes: but man liueth also according to reason, wherewith hee only of all other liuing things is indued. Wherfore these things ought to agree and frame wel together. For men by reason performe many deeds against customes and against nature, if they bee persuaded that it is better otherwise. We haue before declared of what nature Citizens ought to be, for the making of them tractable and obedient to their Lawgiuer. It remaineth that we speak of the institution and trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> of people. For some things are learned by custome, and othersome by hearkening.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Two things there bee wherein men proceed well and euill, to wit, in the end, and in the meanes tending to the end. They proceed well, when the end and purpose is good, and they haue found out the meanes that lead thereunto: and they proceed euill, when there is no meane to attaine thereunto: and whereas it is not good to erre in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that all men desire to liue happily; some attaine to this happinesse, and others cannot attaine thereunto, by reason they are hindered by fortune, or by nature. Now the happy life consisteth in the perfect vse of vertue, being assisted with bodily and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> goods, as instruments: as appeareth by the discourses made in the first and tenth booke of the Ethickes, wherein two sorts of actions doe depend, some of which bee necessarie and good by supposition, as the punishments executed by order of Lawe, whereof Cities necessarily haue need, although it were better to make the men good: otherwise the other actions are simply and absolutely honest, which concerne honour, noblenesse, liberality, and such like. Therefore the vertuous City is happy, and that city vertuous where the Citizens that be members of the Commonweale be vertuous; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming such by nature, custome, and reason: which three things when they frame well together, doe make the bringing vp and institution good, and when they disagree <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> they make it nought. Plutarch treateth of this place of the institution, learnedly and grauely, in his little worke of the bringing vp of children.</p>

Whether the gouernours and obeyers, ought alwaies to be all one and the selfesame persons, or changed by turnes, and to what end the Commonweale ought to be directed, that it is for peace and tranquility, and not for wars <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and lordly dominion.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>NOw forasmuch as euery ciuile societie consisteth of gouernors and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, let vs examine whether the gouernours or obeyers ought to bee changed, or continue alwaies all one and the selfesame persons during their liues. For the discipline &amp; institution ought alwaies to be applied to this end. If the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> some persons were so excellent aboue others, as we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the gods and heroicall personages do excel men, and that straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way they would shew the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues to haue great excellency, first in body, &amp; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> then in mind, as that the excellencie of the gouernours were vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and manifest to the obeyers; certainely it were better, that all one and the selfesame persons should alwaies gouerne, and the selfesame alwaies obey during their liues: But sith as this is no easie thing to find, neither doth that commonly happen (which Sillax writeth to bee a custome amongst the Indians) that their Kings so much excell their subiects: it is necessary for manie causes, that the turne and course of gouerning and obeying, should bee equally imparted to all the Citizens: for there is one kind of equality amongst those that are like, and it is a hard matter for a Commonweale to last which is founded contrary to right. For why the other inhabitants<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> of the Countrey which are desirous of alterations, doe alwaies ioine with them which are barred <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of the gouernement: and the gouernours cannot bee so many in num<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>er, as that they should bee strongest. Notwithstanding, there is n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> doubt but there ought to be some difference betweene the gouernours and obeyers. Therefore it is the Lawgiuers duty to consider how these things shall goe, and after what manner the Commonweale should be communicated and imparted: whereof we haue spoken before. For nature hath giuen the choise, making of all one and the selfsame kind, some young, and others more aged, and it is meet for some to obey, and for others to gouerne; and no man will find himselfe greeued to obey according to age, nor account himselfe an vnderling, specially being in possibility to attaine this honour, when he shall come to more yeares. We may then in some sort say, that they which gouerne and obey are all one and the selfesame persons, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> in another sort that they are not the same, so that it is necessary that the institution be sometimes the same, and sometimes diuerse: and he which will command, must first haue obeyed. Now the Estate of gouernment, (as we haue said in the former bookes) is either for his ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>se and sake which gouernes, or for his which obeyeth. The one, is called a Lordly manner of gouernement, the other a gouernment of free men, and there are certaine employments which differ not so much in the actions, as in the end for which they are done. Wherefore many actions which seem seruile, may be well performed by young men which are free borne, sith regard of credit and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace differ not so much in themselues, as of the end and cause for which they are done. But wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as we said that the vertue of a Citizen, of him which gouernes, and of a good man, is all one; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> and that the same person must first obey, and afterward command; the Lawgiuer must both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour to make men good, and consider by what exercises he may make them become so, &amp; what the end of a good life is. Now there are two parts of the soule, whereof the one hath reason of it selfe, the other hath it not of it selfe, yet can obey reason. Of which parts we say that those vertues are in regard of which a man is called in some sort good. It is no hard thing to vnderstand i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> whether of the two the aforesaid end is, specially to those which follow our diuision: For the worse is alwaies for the betters sake, as it appeareth as well in things which are done by art, as in those
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:7218:203"/>
that are naturall. Now that part which is endued with reason, is the better, and is diuided like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> into two, according to our vsuall manner of diuiding, namely into actiue and contemplatiue reason: So must this part be of necessity diuided, and there is no doubt but that the actions haue the same correspondence, &amp; that the actions of that thing which is better by nature, are more to be desired of those which can obtaine them all, or two which are the most to be desired amongst the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: For that is alwaies most to bee desired of e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ery man, which is the cheefest and last to be obtained. Our whole life is againe diuided into labour and rest, warre and peace. And of those things which are to be done, some be necessary and profitable, others honest, in which it is requisite to obserue the same choice which is obserued in the parts of the soule and their actions, as to make war for peace, to vse labour for rest, and to doe things necessary and profitable for those which are honest. It doth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> therefore behooue the Lawgiuer in making lawes to haue regard to all these things, as well to the parts of the soule, as to their actions, but cheefly to stay on the best, and in those which are finall. The same order also is to be kept in the diuisions of mens li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es and affaires. For it is good to bee so disposed, that one may b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>th follow his businesse, and serue in the warre; prouided that rest &amp; peace be still preferred, and that necessary and profitable things be done, but rather those which are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest: So that the training vp of those which are yet children, and of other ages who haue need of discipline, must be directed to these ends. They among the Grecians who are at this day thought to be well gouerned, and those Lawgiuers who haue formed and constituted such Commonweales, seeme not to haue directed them to the best end, nor their lawes and ordinances to all vertues,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> but to be wholly inclined to those which seeme most profitable. They likewise which haue written since of such matters, doe therein shew that they had the same opinion: For they praising the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians Commonweale, commend their Lawgiuers intent and purpose, who referred all his lawes to victory and warre; which error may be easily reproued by reason, and hath ben confuted by the euents of things. For as the most part of men doe greatly couet and thirst after rule, sith by that meanes they may obtaine many commodities, and great prosperity: So Thibron seemeth to praise the Lacedemonians Lawgiuer, and so doth also whosoeuer els hath written of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweale, because they being long exercised and enured to the perils of warfare, haue greatly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended and enlarged their dominion: But sith they doe now no longer beare such rule, it is certain <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> that they are likewise no longer happy, nor their Lawgiuer good. Besides, it is ridiculous, that obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing still his lawes, and being no way hindered from vsing them, they haue lost their happy life. Neither doe they iudge well of bearing rule, whereof the Lawgiuer should seeme to make great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, because the commanding and gouerning of free men is better, and hath more vertue ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, then the lordly kind of ruling. Furthermore, a Citie is not to be thought happy, nor that Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuer to be praised who doth exercise it in subduing their neighbours and borderers, to the end, to signorise ouer them, sith many inconueniences doe thence arise: For whosoeuer can, will doubtlesse attempt as much against his owne Citizens, and seeke to make himselfe lord of his owne Country. Whereof the Lacedemonians accuse King Pausanias, although he were aduanced to so high a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> of honour. Then no such reason or law is profitable or meet for Cities, for the Lawgiuer must imprint in mens thoughts this opinion, that the selfesame things are good both publickly and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uately. Neither ought men to exercise armes, thereby to bring others into subiection, who deserue it not: but first and cheefly that themselues be not brought into subiection by others, next, to winne some estate, whereby profite may grow to the vanquished, not with intent to raigne ouer men in what manner soeuer, but to command those which are apt and meet to serue. Now the euents of things, agreeing with the reasons which may be framed, do sufficiently witnesse, that the Lawgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer should rather study to referre warlike affaires and all other lawes to rest and peace, sith many such Cities haue ben preserued by making war; and hauing attained large dominions, haue soone <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> after decayed: for in peace they doe as it were rust and lose their brightnesse, euen like yron, wherof the Lawgiuer is the only cause, who hath not taught them to liue in quiet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The better to take order for the education and training vp of youth, it is first requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to know whether they that gouerne and obay the Citie, should be alwaies the selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same, or els sundrie persons, who may command and obey as their turnes fall. But if
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:7218:203"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> there were any such gouernours that excelled both in body and mind, it should bee bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that the most excellent might alwaies gouerne: But among those that are like and equall, it is both more iust and sure to command and obey by turnes. The Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale then must be ordained and instituted according to the order of nature, which of the same kind maketh some young, some old; to the end, that the elder may gouerne, and the yonger obey: so that both the gouernors and obeyers are in some sort the selfesame, and in another sort diuerse, by applying herevnto the discipline: touching the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of young men, it ought to bee free, not lordly, respecting their commoditie that obey, not theirs that command, because the actions that are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded, be iust, honest, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> or dishonest, not so much in regard of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, as of the end for which they are done. Wherefore the Lawgiuer must consider by what customes and endeuors the Citizens may be made good, sith the vertue of a good man, a good Citizen, and of him that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth in a good state, is all one: And sith vertues are certaine habites of the mind, as Aristotle writeth in the second of his Ethickes, the Lawgiuer must therefore know the difference betweene the parts of the mind, of which, the one is reasonable, the other vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable, yet cannot obey reason, first of the Ethickes, and the last chapter, and that the vnreasonable part is as it were the subiect of morall vertues, and the reasonable part the subiect of intellectuall vertues: sixt of the Ethickes, and the first chapter. And although <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> a man be called good in respect of both these kinds of vertues, yet are the intellectuall better, and in the vse of them doth cheefly consist an happie life. But as there are two kinds of reason, namely, actiue and contemplatiue, sixt of the Ethickes, the first chapter; so are there also two kinds of vertues, and the contemplatiue is the better, by meanes whereof an happy life is sooner attained then by the actiue: For honest things are to be preferred before necessary and profitable things, as rest before trauaile, peace before warre. And in such sort must be ordered the bringing and training vp of youth, &amp; other ages, whereon it followeth, that the Lacedemonians Commonweale was not well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted, because the lawes and actions thereof were all referred to war and victory, not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to quietnesse and peace; which thing causeth many inconueniences, and is likewise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by Plato in the first of his Lawes.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>NOw sith it seemeth that mens actions haue the same end both in publicke and priuate respects, and that it is necessary to define a good man and a good Citie in the same manner, there is no doubt but that those ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues which concerne rest are requisite, for peace is oft the end of warre, (as hath ben said) and rest the end of labour. Now those vertues doe further tranquility, and the leading of a commendable life, which are vsed both in time of rest, and of businesse, for there are many things very necessary for a quiet life, and therefore a Citie must haue Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Fortitude, and Constancie: For as the Prouerbe is, slaues haue no rest, and they which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not valiantly expose themselues to dangers, become slaues to those which assaile them. Then in our imployments and businesse, strength and constancie are needfull, and in time of rest Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie; and in both, Temperance and Iustice: but these two are more needfull in time of peace and tranquility, for warre constraineth men to be iust and temperant, and the enioying of prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie with rest in peace, doth make them more insolent. They therefore who seeme happy, and to haue the fruition of all things which cause felicitie, haue great need of iustice, as if there be any such
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:7218:204"/>
as are said by the Poets to dwell in the fortunate Islands, for they shall cheefly haue need of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophie,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> Temperance, and Iustice, because they enioy more rest and tranquility in the abundance of such good things, whereby is appeareth, that no Citie can be happy and vertuous without these vertues. But if it be grosse and filthie not to be able to vse such good things, it is much more grosse, not to be able to vse them in time of quietnesse; and that men in laboring and following the wars, should appeare good, and in time of peace and rest seruile. We must not therefore exercise vertue, as doth the City of the Lacedemonians; who doe not therein differ from other men, because they account not that the cheefe and soueraigne good which others doe, but because they thinke to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine thervnto by any one vertue.

It hath ben already shewed, that three things are needfull, namely, Nature, Custome, and Reason: it hath ben also concluded of what Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the Citizens should be. It remaineth now to consider, whether it bee better to traine them vp first with reason, or with customes, sith these things must agree together. For reason may swar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e from the good end, and sometimes also is led by custome. It is manifest, that as in other things, so in this generation is from the beginning, and the end from some beginning of another end. Then sith reason and vnderstanding are to vs the end of nature, the generation and institution of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners must be therevnto applied. Besides, as the soule and body are two, so we see there are two parts of the soule, the one vnreasonable, the other reasonable<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es likewise two, of which the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> one is Appetite, and the other Vnderstanding. Now as the body is engendred before the mind, so is the vnreasonable part before the reasonable: as it appeareth in that anger, will, and concupis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence doe shew themselues in children so soone as they are borne; but reason and vnderstanding come not naturally, vntill they be of riper age. It is therefore necessary to haue care of the body before the mind, and then of the appetite: yet the care which is had of the appetite, must be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the vnderstanding, and that of the body to the mind. If then the Lawgiuer ought from the beginning to see that their bodies be very good who are brought vp, hee must take order tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching marriage, and consider of what age and nature they should be who ioine themselues in wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locke.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Sith the cheefe and soueraigne good consisteth in the same thing, as well in regard of euery peculiar person, as of a whole Citie, and sith that vertue is the selfesame which maketh a man good, and a Citie good, the Cittie therefore must bee endued with those vertues cheefly which are referred to peace and rest, as Iustice, Temperance, and Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophie. But because peace is oft obtained by war, and rest by trauaile or labour, those vertues also are requisite whereby war and affaires are managed. Nor are the Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians to be imitated, who although they measured vertue in the same sort that other well ordered Cities did, yet they erred in that they thought to attaine thereunto by the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> military kind of vertue only, whereto they wholly addicted themselues: Wherefore by warring, they both vpheld their estate, and flourished; but by enioying peace and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, they lost their happinesse and Empire. The like happened afterward to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes. The Turkes at this present refer all to power &amp; victory, not sparing through their ambicious desire of rule, neither those of their owne religion, nor others: but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they shall imbrace rest, then shal they likewise draw neere vnto their ruine. The first care therefore which euery Lawgiuer ought to haue, is that the Citizens be wel procreated, the next that they bee trained vp in good manners: For this cause hee must before all things take good order touching mariages, and consider of what nature the husband <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> and wife should be, and at what time they should be coupled in matrimony.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XVI. Of the time wherein men and vvomen should be coupled in marriage, and of the procreation of children.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>THe Lawgiuer in taking order touching this matter, must haue regard to the persons, and to their time of life, to the end they may agree in their ages <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> according to the same, and that their season, strengths, or forces be not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like; as if the man were apt for generation, and the woman barren, or the woman apt and the man impotent: For such things cause brawles and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords betweene them. Next he must haue regard to the succession of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that they be not too farre distant from the age of their fathers: For then neither can they yeeld any dutie and recompence to their Parents, being far striken in yeares, nor their Parents helpe them. On the other side it is no lesse vnmeet that they approch too neare therevnto: For herein there is a great inconuenience, because such children wil vse lesse reuerence to their Parents, as being equall, and the nearenesse of their ages will breed contention in their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> keeping of house together. Furthermore, to returne whence wee haue digressed, hee must haue this regard, to the end, that their bodies who shall bee borne, may bee according to his desire: all which things he may accomplish almost by the same industrie. For sith the power of generation doth wholly faile in men at seuentie yeares, and in women at fiftie, the beginning of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction must by proportion of age concurre to these two times. The ioyning of young persons in marriage, is not good for the procreation of children, for as in all other creatures, the births of those which are too young, be vnperfect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> and females, and of small bodies: so must it likewise of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie be in men, wherof we see the experience in those cities, wherin the custome is to ioin in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, persons which are too yong; for there the men are imperfect, and of small stature. Besides, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> young Damosels tra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aile more and with greater paine in childbearing, and more of them die therein. For which cause some expound that answer of the Oracle made to the Troezenians, as if many of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> died for bestowing their daughters in marriage while they were too yong, and not for gathering fruits before they were ripe. Furthermore, it is expedient in regard of Temperance, to keep them from mariage till they be more in yeares, for they which begin so yong to haue the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and vse of men, are more intemperant. Likewise, the bodies of yong striplings are hindered from their full growth, if while they are growing, they vse women. For herein there is a certaine tearme of time, which being past, their growth ceasseth. Wherefore it is expedient that maidens be maried about the age of eighteene yeares, and men at seuen and thirtie, or therabo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t. Thus they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> shal be ioined in wedlocke, while their bodies be in ful strength, and shal cease from procreation in fit time. Moreouer, the succession of children will not fall out amisse, being partly in the flower of their youth, if procreation doe presently follow according to the reason of the time; and partly in the declining of their age, about seuenty yeares. Thus we haue shewed at what ages men and wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may be coupled in mariage. Now touching the seasons of the yeare, we must vse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as many do at this present, who chuse thereunto the winter. And i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> shall bee good to obserue in the procrcation of childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the precepts which are giuen by Phisitians and natural Philosophers. For the Phisitians doe speake sufficiently touching the seasons which are good for the health of the body, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Philosophers touching the winds, preferring the northerly winds before the southerly. But it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> should be better to shew what bodies are apt for generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in that place wherin is handled the brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging vp of childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; we wll therfore now speak breefly therof. For the habitude or dispositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of wrast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers is not good for such a constitution of body as we require, neither yet for health or generation; nor that disposition which is too delicate or too weak; but which is the mean between both. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse there is requisite an habitude enured to labours which are not too violent, nor all of one sort, as the habitude of wrastlers; but to those actions which belong to free me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: this is to be obserued as wel in me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Likewise wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with child must haue care of their bodies, liuing not too much
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:7218:205"/>
at ease, nor too delicately. And this may be remedied by the Lawgiuer if he appoint them to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> daily the Temples of those gods whom they honour and pray vnto for conception. But contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwise the mind must be quiet and setled: For children in the mothers wombe receiue good and hurt, euen as fruits doe from the earth. As for the destroying or bringing vp of children, there should be a law that none might bring vp any which were imperfect or lame in any of his lims. And for the auoiding of too great a number of children, if it be not permitted by the lawes of the Country to expose them, it is then requisit to set down how many a man may haue; and if any haue more then that prescribed number, there must be vsed some meanes that the fruit may be destroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the mothers wombe, before the little ones haue any sence and life, for it were great wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to attempt it afterward. But sith wee haue limitted the age wherein men and women may <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> ioine in marriage, we will also shew how long they may vse the art of generation, and when they ought to giue it ouer, for the children of those which are more in yeares, as well as of those which are too young, bee vnperfect both in body and vnderstanding: &amp; the children of aged persons are weake. It is therefore good to follow herein the time, in which iudgement and vnderstanding are come to their full ripenesse, and that is commonly about the fiftieth yeare, as the Poets say, who measure mans age by seuens. Then fiue or sixe yeares after this age, it is meet to vse no more the act of generation, nor to company with women, vnlesse it be for health or some other cause. And as for the carnall knowing of another husband or wife, we hold it for certain that it is not honest for a man to touch any other woman then his owne wife, while hee is called her husband. And if <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> any during the time of procreation doe otherwise, he is to be pronounced in famous, and duly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished according to the quality of the offence.</hi>

The first is, that the husband and wife be in the same time disposed and apt, the one to beget, the other to conceiue, and that their forces bee not herein vnlike. The second, that the children approch not too neere to the age of their fathers, nor be too farre distant from it. The third, that the wife bee eighteene yeares of age, the husband eight and thirtie,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> when they begin to procreate children: and that they giue ouer, the woman at fiftie yeares of age, the man at seuentie. The fourth, that they bee not maried too young, nor too old, sith the children of those that are too young, as also of those which are too old, bee imperfect both in body and vnderstanding, and besides those children weake, whose parents were aged when they begate them. The fift, that the winter be chosen as a fitter time for genration, and the Northerly winds more agreeable then the Southerly. The sixt, that the disposition of their bodies which procreate, be not too strong as that of wrastlers, nor too weake and tender through pampering, but meane betweene both. The seuenth, that women being with child haue care of their persons, not being too <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> idle, nor liuing too much at ease, but walking oft abroad, and vsing strong food. The eight, that it be not lawful to bring vp children which are vnperfect or impotent in any of their members. The ninth, that there be a certain number limitted of begetting chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and that they which exceed this number, be destroyed in the mothers wombe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they haue sence and life. The tenth, that the fittest age in men for the begetting of children, is in the fiftieth yeare of their age, when mans iudgement and vnderstanding are come to their full ripenesse; and that after that time they abstaine from women, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse it be for their health. The eleuenth, that adultery be forbidden, as wel on the wiues part as the husbands, and that whosoeuer shal doe otherwise, be pronounced infamous <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> and punished. Among these aduertisements the eight and ninth, must in no sort be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued by Christians, but altogether abhorred.</p>

                  <hi>WHen children are borne, there is great regard to bee had with what kind of food they should bee nourished for the strength of their bodies. Wee see by other liuing creatures, and by these Nations which are giuen to warlike discipline, that much feeding on milke is very good for the bodie, prouided that there bee no wine min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled therewith for the preuenting of diseases. Besides, all the motions which may possibly bee vsed in this age, doe greatly profite. And to the end that the members by reason of their tendernesse be not writhed or made crooked, some Nations doe euen at this day vse artificial instruments which keepe their bodies straight. It is good to enure them so soone as they are borne, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to suffer cold, and this is very profitable as well for health, as for military exercises. Wherfore ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny barbarous people haue vsed to plunge their children when they are borne in riuers, or cloth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in thinne apparrell, as the Gaules. Forwhereto soeuer they may be accustomed, it is better to accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome them thereunto euen from their birth, so it be done by little and little. Now the disposition of children, by reason of their heat, is naturally apt to endure in cold. Wherefore this and such like care is to be had in their first age, but afterward vntill they bee fiue yeares old, it is not good to teach them as yet any science, nor cause them to vse any necessary labours, least their growth should be thereby hindered; but onely with such motions as may keepe their bodies from becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming slow and lasie. Which said motions should be prepared both by other actions, and by plaies or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> sports. Neither must their plaies bee dishonest ar painefull, nor too dissolute. Touching the tales which they should heare in this age, the Magistrates that are chosen for instructers of children, are to see thereunto, for all such beginnings must bee applied to their future exercises. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore meet that the most part of their plaies be imitations of those things which they must after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward doe in earnest. They which make lawes against the crying of children, doe not well, because such motion helpes their growth, and doth in some sort serue for exercise to their bodies. For they which labour, gather strength by holding their breath, which thing happeneth to children, when they are vrged to crie. Likewise, the instructers or trainers vp of children, must take great heed to their manner of liuing, and aboue all things that they conuerse not with slaues. And it is also <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> necessary that during this age vntill they be seuen yeares old, they be brought vp at home. Then it is meet to keepe children all this time from hearing or seeing any dishonest things. And the Law-giuer ought to banish altogether out of the Citie all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> looked vnto children, that they neither heare nor see such things. But if any one be found speaking or doing any forbidden things, if he be free borne, but not yet admitted into the number of those which diet together, he should be excluded from that honor, and receiue cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; if he be somewhat elder, he should bee noted as infamous, for hauing committed a slauish act. Now sith wee haue forbidden the speaking of such things, it is manifest that wee forbid them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> also to looke on leud pictures, or dishonest fables. The Magistrates therefore are to see that there be no image nor peece of painting which may represent such actions, vnlesse it be of some gods, to whom the law doth graunt that priuiledge, and permitteth that they of the elder sort do offer sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                     </gap>or their wiues and children. The Magistrats ought furthermore not to suffer the yonger sort to heare Iambiques pronounced, or to see comedies played, vntill they haue attained to the age wherein they are receiued into the number of those which diet together, and that their discipline and institution may keepe them all from drunkennesse and other like inconueniences which grow thereby. We haue now slightly passed ouer this matter, but another time we wil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serre longer vpon it. For this present we haue made as much mention therof, as was nec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and againe from the foureteenth, till the one and twentieth. For they which diuide the ages by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> must commonly say amisse: but it is rather meet to follow the diuision of nature, because eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry art and euery institution, will supply the want of nature. Therefore consideration is to bee had what order ought to be set downe concerning children: next whether it be better to bring them vp publickely or priuately, as the vse at this day is in many cities: thirdly, of what manner this trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and institution ought to be.</hi>

The first is, that their first nourishment be milke, which is a verie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> natural nourishment, and fit to make their bodies strong, so it be not mixed with Wine: The second, that they vse all motions possible for that age: The third, that while they are yet tender, their bodies be kept straight with some instruments deuised for that purpose, to the end, that their members grow not crooked: The fourth, that they be accustomed euen from their birth to suffer cold, which thing is good both for health and militarie exercises: The fift, that after they can goe of themselues and speake, they be not constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the learning of any science, vntill they be fiue yeares old, nor to vse great labour, least their growth should bee thereby hindered, but that they vse such motion as may keepe their bodies from waxing slow and lasie, and that there be some kinds of plaies &amp; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> sports deuised for them, not dishonest or dissolute, nor too painefull and troublesome: The sixt, that their gouernors and instructors teach them pretty tales, meet for the imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of those actions which they must afterward doe in earnest: The seuenth, that their cryings and like vnquietnesse be not hindered, because such motion helpes their growth, and doth in some sort serue for exercise to their bodies: The eight, that aboue al things they neither conuerse nor talke with slaues: The ninth, that they neither heare nor see dishonest, wicked, or odious things, nor vse to recite them; and if they bee herein disobedient, they ought to bee chastised according to their age and qualitie: The tenth, that in considering the things wherevnto the children are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> borne and apt, their institution be diuided into two ages, namely from the seuenth yeare to the fourteenth; and from the fourteenth to the one and twentith.

of all. Which ought to be executed publickely and not priuatly, nor according to the maner which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> euery man vseth at this day in taking care of his owne children, instructing them perticulerly, &amp; in such perticular sciences as pleaseth himselfe: for the teaching and exercise of common things ought to be common, and withall men ought to iudge, that euery man is not his owne, but that they doe all belong to the Citie, sith euery one is a member of the Citie, and that the diligence of euery part hath relation naturally to the diligence of the whole. Wherein the Lacedemonians are praiseworthie for their great care about the teaching and bringing vp of their children, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally publickely. That then it is behoofefull to take order for the instruction and teaching of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and that it should be publickely, it appeareth.</hi>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/>
               <p>Forasmuch as it hath been already resolued, that it is behoofefull to prepare for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the end, by the meanes that lead thereto; and that the end and scope of a good Commonweale, is the same that the end of one man alone is; and that such an end is fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie, and that manners and teaching are the meanes of attaining thereunto: Therfore the Cittizens of a good Commonweale ought to bee conueniently brought vp and taught according to the forme of the same, because euery Commonweale hath her peculiar customes, whereby it is founded and maintained. Wherefore Aristotle goeth forward with this point, which was begun in the former booke; and maintaineth, that such care is most necessary for euery ciuile Gouernour, because the manners of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> are great helpers to the establishing and preseruation of Commonweales. His opinion is like vnto Quintilians, that children should bee instructed publickely accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the manner of the Lacedemonians, and not priuately according to the will and pleasure of their parents; because the children are not proper to them, but belong to the Cittie, as parts of the fame.

               <p>
                  <hi>WE must therefore know what this institution is, and how children should bee instructed, for at this day it is doubtfull, because all thinke not that the same things should be learned by youth for the attaining of vertue, or an happy life. Neither is yet agreed on whether their institution and instruction should bee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> referred to the intellectuall, or to the morrall part of the mind. And the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration hereof is the more intricate, by reason of the vulgar maner of insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution: nor is that question yet decided to know whether it bee better to teach them things which are profitable for mans life, or those which tend to vertue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> or such as are the most excellent; for euery of these points hath some to maintaine it. Touching those which tend to vertue, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing fully resolued on, sith all men doe not honour the same vertue, and therefore it is no meruell if they disagree in the exercise thereof. There is then no doubt that amongst the profitable things, such as are necessary, ought to bee taught, but not all; as it will appeare by distinguishing those which are seemely and Gentlemanlike actions from those which are base: but amongst the profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> things, those onely should be exercised, which make not the person base that exerciseth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Now that action is to be accounted base, as also that art and discipline which maketh the bodie, or mind, or vnderstanding, of a free man vnapt for the vse and actions of vertue. We doe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore call those Arts which mnke the bodies disposition worse, base and mercenary exercises; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they hinder and dull the vnderstanding. It is not vnseemely to follow and practise some li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall sciences vnto a certaine measure: but to be too much addicted thereunto, and to follow the
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:7218:207"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> studie thereof, euen to the attaining of perfection, is a thing subiect to the aforesaid inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and there is great difference for what cause men doe and learne. For if it bee for themselues, or for their friends, or for vertue, it is not vnseemely nor base: but they which doe it for others, shall oft times seeme to do basely and mechanically. Then the disciplines late set downe are doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, as hath been said before.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lawgiuer in taking order for the institution &amp; training vp of youth, must haue regard to two things, the one, wherein children must be instructed, the other, how: for it is not yet agreed on to what end the institution of children must be directed, whether <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to profite, or manners, or contemplation. And this happeneth through the varietie of mens opinions, who place their end in diuerse things, for some thinke that children should learne things necessary and profitable; others, that they should bee instructed in vertues: wherein also they agree not, some preferring the intellectuall vertues, as Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophie; others the morall vertues, as they who deale in wordly affaires, and gouern Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweales; others againe preferring that which concernes magnificence and sumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse. Touching things profitable, there is no doubt such as are necessary, ought to be learned, yet not those that be base, but those that beseeme an honest man. There are some disciplines which may be accounted base and profitable, &amp; likewise honest, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> as they are vsed, and as the end is whereto they are referred: For if they be exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed for gaine, they become base and mechanicall; if to pleasure friends, and for vertue it selfe, they are seemely and honest.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>THere are about foure things which are vsually taught to children, Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar, the art of Exercise, and Musicke. For the fourth, some adde Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: Grammar and Painting, because they are many waies profitable to mans life: the art of Exercise, because it maketh men strong: As for Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke, it might be doubted of, for at this day many learne it for pleasure, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they of auncient times, haue from the beginning placed it in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> number of disciplines, because Nature seekes not onely to doe well, as wee haue often said, but also to bee able to enioy an honest kind of rest. This is the beginning of all things, that I may once againe repeat that which I touched before. For if both are to bee desired, rest must be preferred before trauell and labour: not the rest which men spend in pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y, because then play should of necessitie be the end of our life, which cannot bee, but wee doe rather vse play among our businesse. For they which labour haue need of rest, for which, play was inuented: but trauaile and doing of businesse, is ioined with labour and straining. Therefore it is needfull to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termingle play, obseruing time and occasion to vse the same, and to take recreation in manner of phisicke. For such mouing of the soule is ease and release from toile, and rest is desired for plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> sake. And the taking of rest seemeth to containe pleasure, felicity, &amp; a happy life; which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth not to labourers, but to them which liue at ease and rest: for the labourer and doer of busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse laboureth and taketh paine for some end and purpose that he wanteth: and felicitie is an end which all men suppose, not to be matched with sorrow, but with pleasure. This pleasure is not dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by all men to be of one sort, but euery man applieth and fashioneth it according to himselfe and his owne disposition. Notwithstanding, an honest man dooth make choise of the best kind of pleasure proceeding from honest things. Wherefore it appeareth, that for honest liuing at ease and
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:7218:208"/>
rest, it is needfull to learne certaine things, and to be instructed and trained in the same, and that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> these instructions and trainings be vndertaken for their sakes which learn, and that those which concerne labour and businesse, are desired as necessary, and in regard of other things. Therefore our auncestors haue placed Musicke amongst the sciences, not that it is necessary, for it hath no such thing in it, nor for that it is profitable, as the knowledge of letters is to Merchandise, and to houshold affaires, and to the mathematicall sciences, and to diuerse other ciuile actions. But pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting seemeth behoofefull for the better iudging of Artificers workes: So wee should not account Musicke behoofefull, as the art of Exercise is for the maintenance of strength and health, for wee see neither of these gotten by Musicke. It remaineth then that it serueth to liue Gentlemanlike at ease, whereunto men seeme to haue ordained and assigned it, in that they haue attributed to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> same the pastime and mirth which is deemed to bee fit for Gentlemen. For which cause Homer saith, it was delightfull to call a singer to the feast: and after he had named certaine others, call in (sayth he) a singer, that his sweet song may make vs all merry. And in another place Vlisses vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth that pastime is good when men are ioifull, and the persons sitting at the Table, doe heare singing through all the house. Now it appeareth, that Musicke is a certaine science, and ought not to bee taught to children, as behoo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>efull and necessary, but as Gentlemanlike and honest. But whether there be one only kind of it, or diuerse kinds, and which they be, and how to be taught, we will speake of these matters hereafter, for this time it shall suffice, that by some testimony of men of old time, we haue confirmed our opinion touching the vsuall sciences specially Musicke. Further,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> we are to teach youth some profitable sciences, not only in respect of profite, as it appeareth in the knowledge of letters, but also to the end they may thereby attaine to other sciences. Likewise, the art of painting is to be shewed vnto them, not only for that they should erre the lesse in the getting of particular saleable things, or take heed of being deceiued in buying and selling of furniture and houshold stuffe, but rather to the intent they may learne to consider the beauty of bodies. Doubtlesse, the hunting after profite and aduantage in all places, is not fit for Gentlemen and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen. Sith therefore it is cleare, that children are rather to be taught and trained by manners, than by reason, and rather in those things which pertaine to the body, than in those which belong to the mouing of the mind; we will inferre thereof, that they ought to be committed to the art of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> exercising of bodies, and to the art of hardening children in diuerse strifes, whereof the one fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the nimblenesse of the bodies, and the other the actions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In old time there were in Greece foure faculties which Parents did accustome to cause their children to learne: Grammar, the art of Exercise, Musicke, and Painting: for certaine profites fit for mans life. Grammar serueth to speake well and to read and write well, for the knowledge of letters is necessary for merchandise, for the guiding of hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shold affaires, for the getting of skill, and for the continuance and perpetuating of mans remembrance, and for the publicke and priuate life, in time of peace and war, and of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> rest and businesse. The faculty of Exercise serueth to the maintenance of health and strength, by ordering the body with honest &amp; moderate exercises, as fensing, shooting, casting the stone, riding, wrasteling, running, leaping, dauncing, and swimming. Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke serueth for the solace and comfort of the mind and recreation after labor and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, and hath ben alwaies reckoned for one of the liberall sciences, whereof there shall be a more ample disputation in the three last chapters of this booke. Painting serueth for the better consideration of the beauty of bodies, and vnderstanding of the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all things, that in buying and selling men may haue the more discretion; and for the drawing of plots of publicke and priuate buildings, which is necessary for the art of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> building, for tapistrie, vtensils, and all other instruments and tooles for the war, and for the description of countries, townes, and castles, and their heights, bredths, &amp; lengths: of liuing creatures of all sorts, &amp; of their parts, and of hearbes, trees, roots, leaues, flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, and fruits, for phisicke &amp; the knowledge of simples: as Plato affirmeth in the third booke of his Commonweale, and in the seuenth of his lawes.</p>

Wherefore hee made a law, that all the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Cittie should learne letters at the charges of the Commonweale, which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> should maintaine schoolemaisters to teach them; deeming that the poore (being other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise vnable to pay the stipend due to the maisters) should bee depriued of the best and necessary instructions.

                  <hi>IN those Cities which at this day seeme to vse great diligence in instructing of children, some men apply themselues to get a championlike actiuitie, marring their faces, and hindering the growth of the bodies. And though the Lacedemonians haue not falne into this error, yet do they with labour make themselues beastlike and vnmanlike, as though that were a great furtherance to manhood and fortitude. Howbeit, as wee haue often <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> said, we must not respect one vertue ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap> especially. And though wee should respect this, yet haue they not found the meanes thereof: For wee doe not see in other wights, nor in strange Nations, that strength and manhood doeth accompany the cruellest manners, but the most mild and Lionlike. There be many Nations addicted to kill and eat: as the Achaians vpon the sea of Pontus, and the Heniochians, and among those which inhabite further into the land, some like to these, others more cruelt, who though they lead a theeuish life, yet haue they not Fortitude. Besides, wee knowe that as long as the Lacedemonians did exercise
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:7218:209"/>
continual labors, they excelled all others, and now are excelled by other people of Greece in such <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> seats as concern the facultie of exercise, and in martiall imployments. For they did not excell for exercising of children in this sort, but for this onely that they were exercised against them which exercised not themselues. Therefore they should cheefly be exercised in honesty, and not in cruelty: for neuer will any wol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They therefore which herein yeeld too much libertie to children, and care not for instructing them in necessary things, doe make them very vile; and by supposing to make them seruiceable to the Commonweale in one worke onely, they make them worse then others, as reason sheweth. This is not to bee iudged by their first doings, but by the present deeds, for nowe adaies they with whom they haue to doe, follow their skill, and in time past they had no imitators.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> It is therefore resolued vpon, that the facultie of exercise is to bee vsed, and after what manner it is to be practised.

For the body and mind must not labour both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> at one time, because these labours haue their effects contrary by nature, sith the labour of the body hinders the mind, and the labour of the mind hinders the body.</hi>

               <p>Two faults are commonly committed in teaching the facultie of exercise to chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: The one is that by assaying to make them strong, their faces are marred, and the growth of their bodies hindered. The other is, that they make them beastlike and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell, by directing their whole training to one martiall vertue alone, as the Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans did. Therefore Plato in the third booke of his Commonweale, considering the faults of the art of exercise, will not haue it shewed alone, but mingled with Musicke:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> that being so tempered, the one may serue to the strength and health of the body; and the other to the modesty of the mind: affirming also in Timeus, that the body ought not to bee exercised without the mind, nor the mind without the body, because these two skils being separated, the one engendreth rudenesse and wildnesse, the other tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and delicatenesse. But Aristotles opinion is, that they should be moderately she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed to children vntill the foureteenth yeare of their ages, by easie and gentle exercises, without ioining thereunto violent food, and of hard disgestion, nor constrained la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, to the end their growth should not bee hindered. And after that age, when they haue employed three yeares in other sciences, that then they may bee exercised in har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der labours of the bodie, and fed with grosser meates. Plato in his seuenth booke of Lawes sheweth also after what manner the art of Exercise is to bee learned and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>IN the former discourses wee haue already set downe some doubts concerning Musicke, which it shall be good to repeat in this place to serue as an occasion to a more ample dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation which may be here made thereof. For it is not easie to r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> hath, and why it is to bee learned, to wit, whether for sport and recreation, as sleeping and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, which of themselues are no vertuous things, but pleasant, and withall cause the ceasing of care, as Euripides sayth; therefore set they Musicke in this ranke, and vse all these things alike, I meane Sleeping, Drinking, and Musicke, whereunto they adde Dauncing: Or rather whether it be better to referre Musicke to vertue, and that as exercise nimbleth the bodies, so Musicke may dispose the manners, accustoming to make merry with honestie: Or whether it serue for the passing away of time honestly, and for the getting of wisedome; for of those things which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged touching Musicke, this ought to be the third. Now that children are not to bee taught for plaies sake, it appeareth by this, that they play not when they learne, and that it is a paine to learn. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Neither is it meet that children and such ages should haue it taught them as a seemly recreation, because the end &amp; perfection agreeth not with any imperfect thing. But peraduenture the study of children might seeme to bee brought in by sport for to serue them when they bee growne to mans estate, and come to perfection. If it be so, why then doe they learne it themselues, and not vse it as the Kings of the Persians and Medeans, who enjoy this pleasure and art by the meanes of others which are skilfull therein? For it is necessary, that they which continually exercise one selfesame action or art, doe it better then others which bestow therein so much time as may serue onely to learne it. But if they should labour in such things, then should they by the same reason learne to make ready their own meat, and to play the cookes, which were an absurd and impertinent thing: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> there is the same doubt whether it can better the manners. For to what end shall they learne it, and wherefore shall they not rather receiue pleasure by hearing others, and be able to iudge ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of as the Lacedemonians are, who can iudge of good or bad tunes, yet haue not learned the art thereof? There is the same reason whether men vse it for the passing of time in seemely and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest sort. Againe, wherefore shall they learne it themselues; and not receiue pleasure thereof by others? Let vs consider the opinion which we haue of the gods. Certes, we shall neuer read in the Poets that Iupiter himselfe doth sing or play on the Harpe, but wee doe call and account such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons base, and we say that such an act doth not belong to any man of quality, vnlesse he bee drunke or merrily disposed. But perhaps we will afterward consider thereof: The first question is, to know <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> whether Muiscke is to be accounted science or not, and which of the three things by vs set downe it can doe, discipline, or play, or a Gentlemanlike and happy life. But it is by good reason necessarie for them all, and seemeth to participate of all. For play is for rests sake, and rest must needes bee plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant, sith it is the medicine of that greefe and trouble which growes by labour. And it is certaine that such pastimes as yeeld any credite to those which vse them, ought not onely to bee honest, but pleasant also, because felicitie consisteth in both. Now wee doe all confesse that Musicke is a very pleasant thing, as well the naked and simple kind, as that which is with melody: and the Poet Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seus saith, That songs are pleasant to mortall men. For which cause men doe with good reason vse Musicke in publicke meetings and honest pastimes, as a thing which hath power to reioice &amp; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> delight. Whereupon it might be thought that children should be taught it. For all things which yeeld pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>sure without hurt, are not good in regard of the end only, but also of succeeding our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, as it were by turnes. Then sith men doe sildome attaine to the end, and doe many times rest themselues, and vse plaies, it shall bee very profitable to take recreation thereby; not excessiuely, but so much as is needfull, thereby to enioy pleasure. But some men do propose play vnto themselues for an end, and that peraduenture, because the end yeeldeth some, but not all pleasure; which they seeking, take one for another, because there is some likenesse in the end of our actions. For the end is not desired for any future thing, nor such pleasures likewise for the things which are to come, but for those which are past, as labours and troubles: wherevpon it might bee coniectured; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> that this is the cause for which men seeke happinesse by these pleasures. And sith musicke is st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>died not for it selfe alone, but also because it is a friend and furtherer of rest, it might bee demanded whether this doe accidentally come vnto it, for the nature thereof is more worthy then the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said vse. Neither must we receiue by musicke the common pleasure only which all men doe receiue and feele, because musicke hath a naturall pleasure, and therefore the vse thereof is agreeable to all ages and manners; but wee must besides consider whether it pertaine to the manners, and to the mind, which may be easily knowne, if we receiue thereby any qualitie touching our manners.
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:7218:210"/>
Now that we receiue thereby some quality, it appeareth by sundry others, &amp; cheefly by the games of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> Olimpus, which do doubtlesse rauish mens minds; &amp; rauishment is an affection which hath relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the manners of the mind. Furthermore, men hearing any imitations, feele a simpathy, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be not in verse nor melody. Then sith musick is a pleasant thing, and sith vertue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth in honest delectations, &amp; in louing and hating; certes there is nothing which should bee so much learned, as to iudge wel and to delight our selues with courteous manners, and honest acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Now there is in rimes and songs as well some likenesses drawing neare to the very natures of wrath, and of gentlenesse, of manhood, and temperance, and of all their contraries; as also other some which pertaine to manners, as is prooued by experience: For the mind is altered at the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of them. And our accustoming of our selues to be offended or well pleased with such kinds <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> of things, drawth neere after a sort to the very things the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, as for example, if any man take pleasure in beholding the image of another, not for any other cause then for the formes sake, it must needs be that the sight of the same part whose picture he looketh on, pleaseth him wel. There is not in the other sensible things, any likenesse or imitation of manners: as for example, in those things which moue the sence of touching or tasting, and but a litle in those which moue the sight. Such are the figures which moue little, and such is the common sence of all persons. Moreouer, these are not images of manners, but rather signes, representing the colours and figures of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners which are in the body when it is troubled with passions. But if it make any matter to behold these things, childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ought not as much to see the works of Pason, as of Polignotus, and some other <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> painter or grauer which expresseth maners. That there be imitations of manners in harmonies themselues, it is manifest, in that there is presently such difference in the nature of harmonies, that the hearers are diuersly disposed, and not moued all after one sort by euery of them, but are stirred vp by some of them to sadnesse and weeping, as by that tune which is called Mixolydian; and by other waxe more mild in mind, as by the base tunes; and by some other moderatly &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly, as the Dorian tune amongst all harmonies seemeth to doe; the Phrigian tune rauisheth. These things are very well set downe by them which haue studied this science, who confirme their reasons by the witnesse of the deeds themselues. The like also happeneth in rimes, for some of them cause grauer manners, and others lighter fashions: againe, some of them haue foolish and vnapt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> mouings, and othersome haue honester mouings. Therefore it followeth of these reasons, that Musicke hath force to dispose the affections of the mind in diuerse sorts. And if it be able so to do, without all doubt children ought to be instructed and taught the same. Certes, the teaching of Musicke is fit for the nature which children haue, at such time as by reason of their age they doe nothing with a good will except there be pleasure in it. And musicke of her owne nature is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and it seemeth that there is affinity betweene harmonies and rimes. Therfore many wise me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> affirme that the soule is an harmony, or that there is harmony in it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this place he discourseth affirmatiuely and negatiuely, whether Musicke bee a sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> and whether it ought to be learned for recreation &amp; pleasure, or whether it serue for manners and an happie life: about which there are many goodlie reasons set downe for each way, which are pleasant to read, and easie to vnderstand.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> MANY <hi>wise men do affirme that the soule is an harmony, or that there is harmony in it.</hi>] Plato in his Phedon bringeth in Symmias talking thus with Socrates: I beleeue assured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Socrates, that you know well inough what we thinke of the soule, to wit, that there is in our bodies some intention and complexion of hote and cold, drie and moist: &amp; that the certaine temperature and agreement of those qualities, are our soule liuing in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> bodie when those qualities be moderated &amp; tempered together. Therefore if the soule be a certaine harmonie, then at all times, when and as often as the nature of these qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities which are in the bodie, diminisheth or encreaseth too much by reason of sicknes or other inconueniences, the soule also (though it bee most diuine) must needes perish forthwith, like as other tunes doe which consist in voice, or are made by other skill: but the rest of the bodie lasteth longer, vntill it bee burned or consumed by rottennesse.
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:7218:210"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Consider therfore what is to be answered to any one that shall say, the soule is nothing else but a certaine temperature and agreement of qualities together, which are in the bodie; and that the soule dieth and endeth the first. Socrates answering hereunto, doth by many goodly reasons confute that opinion of them who supposed the soule to bee a harmony and mixture of humours, comparing the bodie to a Harpe, and the soule to a harmonie.

                     </gap>o set downe what is fit or not fit for ages, and to confute them which vphold the stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die thereof to be vile. First of all sith it is conuenient to lay hand to the worke for to iudge right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the same; therefore is it needfull that while they be children, they should exercise the same: after when they waxe elder, that then they should leaue the exercise of it, but they may well iudge thereof, and take pleasure of the same by reason they learned it in their youth. As for the blame <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> which some doe lay vpon Musicke, as though it made men vile, it is no hard matter to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere it, if we consider how farre they which are to bee taught in the ciuile vertue, are to proceed in this art, and what songs, and what rimes they are to vse, and also vpon what instruments they shall learne. For it is likely there is some difference therein, and that therein consisteth the dissoluing of their obiection: because there is no impediment to the contrarie, but that certaine sorts of Musicke are able to doe that which is said. It is then a most cleare case, that it is conuenient to learne this Art, with such respect, that it be no impediment to their future actions, nor make the person vile and vnapt for martiall and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile exercises: First for practise, and next for skill. As for the manner of learning it, it shall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> be good that too much labour bee not employed in such things as are too full of cunning, nor in wonderfull and curious workes, which in this age are come into theatres and open plaies of Musicke, and since haue beene reduced to discipline. But farther, it is conuenient to spend time about such things, vntill some pleasure may bee receaued by sweete songs and rimes, and not to vnderstand onely the common Musicke, as some other liuing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Here will I also adde what hath happened vnto it, which is contrary to science, namely, that the sound of the flute hindereth the vse of reason. Therefore our auncestors haue vpon good ground <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>orbidden the practise thereof to children and free men, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> they had vsed the same before. For when they had gotten more leisure through the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of wealth, and bare a better mind toward vertue, and conceaued a great opinion of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues before and after the warres of the Medes, by reason of the good successe which they had in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> the same, they applied themselues to all manner of sciences without choise or iudgement of anie, but by searching them out, and training them onely. Vpon this occasion amongst other sciences they receiued the art of playing vpon Flutes. For in Lacedemon a certaine maister of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of singers, played himselfe vpon the Flute to his company of singers, and it grew to such practise in Athens, that the most part of the Noblemen learned it, as appeareth by the Table which Thrasippus set foorth, when hee furnished the charge of the playes for the Tribe of Eic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantide. Afterwards experience it selfe reprooued it, when they could better discerne those things which either appertained or did not appertaine to vertue. Likewise, many old instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments haue beene reiected, as the Pictides, Barbites, and others which tended to the pleasure of such as heard them, as the seuen cornerd and three cornerd instruments, and Dulcymers, and all those instruments which require the skill of the hand to play vpon the same. And not without cause haue the men of old time deuised the fable of the Flutes, who say, that Miner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua after shee had inuented the Flutes, found fault with them, and cast them away: And it is not against reason to say that the goddesse did so, for that shee misliked the disfiguring of the face which the Flutes make; although it bee more likely and credible that shee did so, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the skill of playing vpon the Flutes, dooth no good to the mind, and for that wee attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute vnto Minerua all Sciences and Arts. But forasmuch as wee condemne the artificiall skill and exercise of instruments, and account that artificiall which serueth to the playing of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> not directing him to vertue which practiseth the same, but tending to the absurd and filthie pleasure of the hearers: Therefore deeme wee that such kind of exercise is not fit for honest men, but rather for slaues and craftsmen: For the marke whereunto they direct their end and scope is naught. For the importunate and ridiculous looker on hath accustomed to change the Musicke. Insomuch, that after a sort hee depraueth and marreth the players which studie to please him and their bodies, by reason of the mouings which they make.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Children ought to learne Musicke, not onely by hearing, but also by singing and playing vpon iustruments themselues. For it is not possible to iudge rightly of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> same otherwise. But it is not conuenient to accustome them to all manner of songs and instruments, nor to take paines about those that are too artificiall, wonderful, and curious, which containe more ostentation then profit.</p>

For the curiousnesse of learning and seeking out of old matters haue vsually come into Citties through idlenesse, when any haue alreadie prepared such things as are needfull for this life, and not before.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> it hath beene obserued in many Nations, that they began to decay when they imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed learning: for when they bee poore they prosper by deeds of armes, and when they wexe rich, they fall to studie, by meanes of the leasure which they haue gotten, and forsake the labour and hard exercises of the warres. For as much then as the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions at their beginnings bee poore, they make no account of learning, and verie fewe men are there found in them that haue leasure to studie and write. Therefore the originall and antiquities are vnknowne.

               <head>CHAP. VII. Of harmonies and rimes, or numbers.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>WE are yet farther to consider of harmonies and rimes, and how they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> are referred to science: to wit, if all harmonies, or all numbers and rimes must bee vsed, or if there be a distinction to bee made of them. Next, whether wee should prescribe to those which studie learning the same manner, or some other third. And sith wee see that Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke consisteth in the composing or framing of harmonies and rimes, we must know what efficacie both of them haue in regard of science; and which kind of Musicke is to bee preferred, whether that of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodies, or that of rimes. We suppose that many things haue beene well said touching this matter by some moderne Musitians and Philosophers skilfull in Musicke, to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> which Authours wee will referre those which desire the exact knowledge thereof, and will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound onely in generall the seuerall kinds. Now sith wee allow that diuision of songs which some Philosophers haue made, who tearme some morrall, some actiue, and others rauishing; and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie the nature of harmonies to each of them accordingly, wee affirme that Musicke is to bee vsed not for one profite onely, but for many, as for science and for purgation: wee will nowe speake simply what wee meane by purgation, whereof wee purpose to speake more plainely in our art of Poetrie. Thirdly, for honest pastime and for the recreation of the mind, as also for release from toile. Then it is certaine that all kinds of harmonies may bee vsed, but not in the same manner, but for the learning of those which are very morrall: for the hearing of others which are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> with the hand in this art, as well actiue as rauishing, because the affection which dooth vehemently moone certaine minds, is found in all, but in some more, in others lesse, as compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and feare, and likewise the rauishing of the mind: For there are some subiect herevnto, whome wee see in vsing verses which stirre vp the mind, to bee in such a plight, as if they had taken Phisicke and some Purgation. The same thing dooth of necessitie happen to those which are prone to compassion, or fearefull, and generally to all such persons as are subiect to anie passion: and to others, according as euerie one is thereto enclined: all which receaue some purgation, and are merrie with pleasure. Likewise the purgatiue songs procure mirth and gladnesse in men without hurt. Wherefore the Musitians which play in Theatres, ought <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> to haue regard to such harmonies and such songs. But because the beholders are of two sorts, the one free borne and skilfull, the other importunate and vnruly, consisting of mechanicall and mercenarie persons and such like, there must bee vsed for them also certaine playes and sight<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> which may delight and recreate them. For like as their minds bee wrested from the naturall disposition of the same, so bee there as well harmonies which swarue from the order of good tunes, as also vehement, rough, and rude songs, and euery person taketh delight in that which is fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> for his nature. Therefore players are to bee allowed to vse such kind of Musicke to such lookers on. But for institution and bringing vp, we are to vse (as I haue set downe) morrall songs, and such harmonies as the Dorian is, as we haue before touched. And if there be any other <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> harmonie which they that are learned in Philosophie and Musicke haue liked of, it is also to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed. Socrates in the books of the Commonweale hath not done wel in leauing the Phrigian har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony only with the Dorian: and that sith of all instruments of musicke he condemneth the flute, for the Phrigian harmonie hath the like vertue amongst harmonies, that the flute hath amongst instruments, being both of them causers of troublesome motions, as poetry teacheth vs: forasmuch
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:7218:212"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> as euery raging furie, and euerie such other moouing, is caused more by the Flutes, then by anie other instrument; and amongst harmonies, take their com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>linesse in the Phrigian tune: so that the Dythyrambe seemeth certainely to bee Phrigian, which they that are skilfull in this matter, doe prooue vnto vs by many examples, and amongst others by the example of Philoxenus, who hauing vndertaken to sing Dythrambicall verses in the Dorian tune, could not performe what hee had taken vpon him, but being led by nature her selfe, fell into the Phrygian tune, being a conuenient harmonie. As touching the Dorian harmonie, all men confesse that it is very constant, and most conuenient for manly manners. Moreouer, sith wee praise the meane betweene two extremities, and because wee say the meane ought to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and that the Dorian hath this nature, being compared with other harmonies, it is without all doubt that the Dorian songs are most fit to bee taught vnto children. But two things are to bee regarded, namely, what is possible, and what is conuenient to bee done. For all men ought rather to enterprise such thinges as are possible, and which are fit for them, the which are determined by the ages themselues, as for example, it is not easie for folke which are weake through age, to sing strong and vehement tunes, but nature hath giuen to that age the low tunes. Therefore Socrates is also rightly found fault withall herein by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Musitians, because as concerning teaching and bringing vp of children, he condemned low harmonies, as if in his opinion they caused drunkennesse, not according to the force of drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> which causeth raging furie, but for that they are faint, broken, and base. Therefore it is good to learne such harmonies and such songs, to vse them in old age. Againe, if there bee any such harmonie as is fit for childrens age, because it may bee an ornament and instruction withall, as the Lydian harmonie of all harmonies seemeth to bee: doubtlesse it is conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent as touching the teaching and bringing vp of children, to haue regard to these three things, to wit, to the meane, to what is possible, and to what is meet and conuenient.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Songs bee morrall, or actiue, or rauishing. Those bee morrall which imitate the manners and affections, and appertaine to instruction. Those actiue, which pertaine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to rest and pleasure, to the end, to recreate the mind, and rest the bodie, that it may returne stronger to labour. Those rauishing, which are vehement, as the sound of Trumpets, Drummes, and Cornets, whereby mens minds are vehemently mooued, and as it were put out of reason. As much is to bee deemed of harmonies, and they ought to bee framed as songs bee, to wit, some to manners and bringing vp, other some to the purgation or ridding away of troublesome affections; and the rest to recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. One harmonie is Dorian, another Phrygian, and another Lydian, taking their names of these Nations, which had Musicke differing each from other, as at this day the French harmoniess bee mild, the Italian harmonies mournefull, the English and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> high Dutch harmonies manlie, and the Heluetian harmonies, stirrers of troublesome motions. It is therefore conuenient to vse Musicke for three causes, namely, instruction, purgation, and recreation: neither must good harmonies onely bee vsed for honest and skilfull persons, but sometimes also such as are leaud and wanton must bee vsed in the Theatres to recreate the vulgar and mechanicall sort, whose minds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing depraued, take pleasure in like kinds of harmonies: for euery one delighteth in that which best fits his nature.</p>
