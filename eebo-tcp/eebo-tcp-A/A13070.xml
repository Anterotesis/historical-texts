            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

So no doubt of it, <hi>Dauids</hi> penne in the writing of this Pſalme

thy death, O graue I will be thy deſtruction.</hi> For although the
ſtubborne and vncurable Iewes carried ſtately mindes as
then, and reſiſted the Apoſtles with a malignant counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance:
yet in the xl. yeare after Chriſtes reſurrection, they
ſuffered grieuous and iuſt puniſhmentes for their outrages.
And the kingdome of the deuill, ſinne and death is ſo broken
and cruſhed in peeces by Chriſt, that it can bring no danger
vnto the godlie ones: Let vs therefore with S. Paule ſing
this triumph ſong 1. <hi>Cor. 15. 55. O death where is thy ſting, O
graue where is thy victory? The ſting of death is ſinne, and the
ſtrength of ſinne is the Law: But thankes be to God which hath
giuen vs victory, through our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. verſe</hi> 56. 57.

So the enemies of the Goſpell and of the Church (by
the breath of Chriſtes mouth, which is both winde and flame)
are either healed, or taken vtterlie awaie and deſtroied alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether:

is to be put in minde of the chiefeſt matters, ſo often times

implying that ſaying of ſaint <hi>Paule, Rom. 5. 15. 20. Grace
oueraboundeth aboue ſinne.</hi> For if ſo great force or effect were
not procéeding from the louing ſauour and mercie of God, he

that the promiſe of the Goſpel is vniuerſall, &amp; pertaineth vnto
all perſons that do trulie call vpon God: for in God there is
no courtlike reſpect of perſons, but God is indéede equall to
the equall: that is to them which trulie repent, and flie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Mediator. Touching this conſolation mo things are
ſpoken by <hi>Paul, Rom. 10. verſes,</hi> 6, 10, 11, 13, 14. Finally this
ſelfe ſame vocation of the Gentiles refuteth the Phariſaical
opinion, which imagineth that ceremonies are righteouſnes
before God: for the Gentiles are by God receyued into fauor

cauſes, which we ſhall thorowly beholde when God ſhall be all

               <p>And although ſome vnlearned perſons fondly diſpute, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God
ſeeing he is omnipotent, could reſtore mankinde into his ancient

which thing ſith ſo it is, God muſt not only haue his place of mer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cy,
but alſo of righteouſnes attributed vnto him, touching his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
prouidence in the redeeming of mankind. As therefore the
immenſe mercy of God would not beholde the vniuerſall death
and deſtruction of our nature, according to that ſaying of <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
Lament. 3. cap. 22. It is the mercy of the Lorde that we are not
conſumed:</hi> So the eternall and vnchangeable righteouſneſſe of
God required a ſatisfaction for the offence and for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
For the Law of God which is a rule of iuſtice in God, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth
good and euill, and bindeth the reaſonable creature
to become conformable to that rule, and denounceth horrible
deſtruction vnto all thinges which are contrary to that rule.
Wherefore ſeeing the ranſome pacifieng the wrath of God, and
ſatisfieng the righteouſneſſe of God, could neither bee paide by
Angels nor by any other creature, becauſe the malice of ſinne is
infinit, and no creature is able to endure the wrath of God, it is
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:13845:16"/>
by Gods wonderfull wiſedome decreed; that the ſecond perſon
of the Godhead which is called <hi>the word</hi> ſhould take vpon him
the nature of man, and ſhould ſatisfie the lawe of God for the
fault and puniſhment in mankind: That is, that he, which knew
no ſinne, ſhould take vpon him to redeeme vs from ſinne, that
by him we might bee made the righteouſneſſe of God. In this
decree, with admiration whereof the very Angels ſtand amazed

no remiſsion of ſinnes graunted, without recompence and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
made. For, thinke, I pray you, howe great the force of
Gods wrath is againſt ſinne, when he could not be pacified with
any other ſacrifice, but by the paſsion and death of the immacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
Lambe: And we indeed by the greatneſſe of this remedie
may eſteeme the greatneſſe of our ſickneſſe and ſore. For, as

be, but with him alſo he will giue vs all thinges: Therefore ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall

there of <hi>Ezechias</hi> king of <hi>Iuda.</hi> With the ſame face do they
bragginglie ſtriue that the ſame Prophet in the 53 <hi>cap.</hi> prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
not of the Meſſias or Sauiour that was to come, but
of the Iewiſh people. So where they buſie themſelues vpon

ignorance and impietie, the race of the kings of the Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:13845:22"/>
23. verſe is ſaid. 2 The ſecond degree of puniſhment, is
perpetuall thraldome, and moſt miſerable; for although now
and then they haue put in practiſe with warres to recouer
their Countrey, and restore their Church and policie, yet by
Gods prouidence being ouerthrowne, they acknowledged
themſelues but to rol the ſtone with <hi>Syſiphus,</hi> &amp; to play at the

                     </hi> And the ſpeciall reaſon or cauſe
for which the Lord God ordained theſe ceremonies, was that
they ſhould be tipes or figures of one onelie ſacrifice taking
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:13845:23"/>
away the ſinnes of the world. When this ſacrifice was once
offered, then by good right and reaſon ceaſed the Leuiticall
ſacrifice. But what time the Leueticall prieſthood flouriſhed,
the ſlaughter and ſacrificing of beaſts without faith and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall

inough to do the workes by God commanded, except they be
done in ſuch order, as the wiſedome of God hath ordained.

whereof, the firſt is greatneſſe of temptation and
calamities. The ſecond is multitude or concourſe

multitude of calamities do weaken and bring low; but whome

neither of theſe twaine doe ouermaſter, yet euen him doth long

ſeene in <hi>Iob,</hi> as it were in a looking glaſſe: when worde was
brought to this moſt holy man <hi>Iob</hi> of the loſſe of all his ſubſtance
and death of his children, whom his houſe ſlew when it fell vpon

him: all nations ſhall do him ſeruice for euer.</hi> In these words
is his eternitie moſt euidently deſcribed: <hi>Before the Sunne:</hi> that
is, before the ſhining Sunne in the heauens was created, hee was
the Sonne of God For the Hebrew Text vſeth in this place a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
worde, ſignifying doubtleſſe that the Sonne of God was
borne before anie Sunne ſhined in the worlde. Againe alſo it
affirmeth manifeſtlie, that this Sauiour muſt alwayes bee called
vpon, yea, when he is not ſeene with our eyes. He ſpeaketh not
here then of the geſtures of the bodies, which with reuerence is
vſed towards them, but by them towardes Chriſt; and hee ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
generallie of all good mindes, which do craue of the ſame
our Sauiour Chriſt, that he would haue mercie vpon vs, and bee
our Mediator vnto his father, that he would forgiue vs our ſinnes,
giue vs his holie ſpirit and life euerlaſting, and bee our defender
and helper in the daungers of this life againſt the furies of the
Diuels, and the wicked ones in this worlde. Such a kind of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
yeeldeth rightlie omnipotencie vnto the Sauiour, and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth
that he is God. But y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> indeed his kingdom is not a world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
policie, but ſpirituall and eternall. Theſe Arguments do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
the ſame. The benefite of the Sauiour pertaineth vnto the
vniuerſall Church, from the beginning of the world vnto the end
of the ſame. Now if the kingdome of Chriſt had bin politike, it
ſhould not haue brought anie profit or vtilitie vnto the Fathers
and Prophets which haue departed out of this life, before the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming

may we doubt any thing, but that the Iewes and others (drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming

let vs hold faſt that notable ſaying of <hi>Auguſtine</hi> cited

from the ſonns, yet is it not ſaide that hee ſhall come to
iudge the quicke and the dead, but the ſonne ſhall iudge them,
becauſe there neither the deitie of the Father, nor of the ſonne
ſhall be ſéene, but that forme or likenes of the ſonne which he
hath vnited vnto him by the myſterie of his incarnation. The
ſame forme or likenes in him then ſhall be Iudge, which ſtood
before the Iudge; the ſame ſhall iudge which hath bin iudged,
that the wicked ones may beholde his glorie, againſt whoſe
clemencie they haue grudged. Such a Iudge therefore ſhall
he appeare, as he may bee ſeene both of them whom hee ſhall
crowne, and of them whom he ſhall condemne. But the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſhall not then appeare, becauſe he tooke not vpon him the
ſhape of a ſeruant, but vnto his <hi>Sonne</hi> who was alſo made
<hi>Man,</hi> hath be giuen all power of iudgement. Thirdly, this firſt
verſe confirmeth the Reader to acknowledge Chriſt, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
to be the ſon of <hi>Dauid</hi> after the fleſh, but alſo the verie ſon
of God. For God giueth not his glorie vnto anie other, as
<hi>Eſaias</hi> 42. ſaith. Seeing then he deliuereth vnto this Sauiour
both his iudgement and his iuſtice, we muſt no time doubt
but that the Sauiour is trulie, and by nature God. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
this verſe teacheth vs what are the benefities of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour;
for iudgement by the phraſe of the ſcripture ſignifieth

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:13845:38"/>
proper iuriſdiction: wherefore ſeeing Chriſtes kingdome is
comprehended within the ſame boundes wherein the whole
world is comprehended, doubtles we muſt confeſſe that this
kingdome is not a worldlie Empire, like as the Iewes do
dream. But peraduenture ſome man would ask what maner
of kingdom, the kingdom of Chriſt is? There is nothing that
we may so eaſily expresse. The kingdome of the Chriſt in this life;
is to kéepe and reſtore the miniſterie of the Gospell: alſo to
gather and reuiue the Church with his worde and holie ſpirit
giuen, and to protect her wonderfullie againſt the diuels and
tyrants, &amp; after this life to raiſe her members vp from death
to life, and bring them to his eternall Father. Out of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
maie be taken the difference of Chriſtes kingdome
and a politike kingdome. Alſo they differ in obiects, in bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites,
in forme of gouernment, glorie, defences, and stabilitie:
for, firſt the politike power gouerneth the part which is moue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and brideleth the externall members, that they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
within their duties: but the kingdome of Christ not
onelie gouerneth externall manners, but reprehendeth and
healeth the hearts, as in <hi>Iſay, 61. ver. 1. To binde vp the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
hearted.</hi> Secondlie, the chiefe benefits of politike power
are discipline and peace of bodies: but the ſpirituall and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
benefits of this kingdome, are righteouſneſſe and peace
of conſcience before God. Thirdlie, they differ in forme go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment:
for other kings and princes chuſe fit miniſters to
beare authoritie in the Common-wealth, endued with wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and eloquence: but Chriſt chooſeth the fooliſh things of
this world to confound the wiſedome of the wiſe: or as the 8,
<hi>Pſalme, ver.</hi> 2. ſaieth. <hi>Out of the mouth of verie babes and ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
he hath made perfect his kingdome.</hi> Moreouer they differ
in forme of execution, as in defence, and punishments: for
the politike power defendeth his ſubiects with weapons, and
puniſheth diſobedient persons with corporall force, or with
the ſworde: but Chriſt by the preaching of the Goſpell giueth
euerlaſting benefits, remiſſion of ſinnes, the holie Ghoſt, and
life euerlaſting, and puniſheth diſobedient persons, not with
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:13845:38"/>
corporall force, but with his worde, namelie lawfull excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication.
Fourthlie, they differ in glorie: for the glorie of
gouernments is in the excellencie of counſell in ciuill or
peaceable gouernment, and in valiancie and good successe in
warre: but the proper glorie of the Church in this life is, true
knowledge of God, prayer, profeſſion of the true doctrine,
and perpetuall preſeruation of the Church, although ſhee bee
perſecuted in ſome members. The greatnes of minds in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercomming
or vanquiſhing all inticements and terrifying
torments of the wicked, the ornament of manie vertues
wherein the preſence of God is perceiued and ſeene. Fiftlie,
the defences of a politike kingdome are hoaſts of men, and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
neceſſarie in charges of domeſticall affaires &amp; to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
warres abroad: but the Church is not defended with
viſible helpes, but is gouerned by the ſonne of God, and hath
the Angels her ſuper intendents or watchmen. Laſtlie, they
differ in ſtabilitie: for all politike gouernements haue their
end and limit of time: but of this kingdome there shall bee
none end, becauſe the king in eternall, and he giueth vnto his
people eternall life, which is here begun, and shall be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished
after the reſurrection. These things muſt bee often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
touching the difference betweene Chriſts kingdome, and
politike kingdomes: not onelie to refuſe the Iewes, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to inſtruct vs alſo, leaſt the conſolation &amp; inuocation vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Sonne of God, and our exerciſes of faith be obſcured
or darkened with politike imaginations. For the eyes being
bent vpon politike benefits (when they are once gon) do think
that the church is but a caſtaway from god. This imagination
muſt we refuſe, and ſtedfaſtlie, beleeue, that true beléeuers are
not therfore, caſt away from the ſonne of God, no though they
be in the middes of punishments or torments: for as ſaint
<hi>Paule</hi> ſaith, <hi>We ſtand, and reioyce vnder the hope of the glorie of
God not onelie, but alſo We reioyce in tribulations, &amp;c. Rom. 5.

verſes: As if he ſaid, therefore ſhall they fall down and worſhip

forth in the example of our firſt parents. <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eua</hi> after

nor yet by anie other creature: Here commeth Chriſt the ſonne
of God from his ſecret ſeat, receiueth offenders into fauour,
and giueth them life. So afterwards followed innumerable
eramples of this Lordes benefits beſides and without ſecond
causes: as when he preſerued <hi>Noah</hi> in the deluge: when he ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<hi>Ioſeph</hi> whom his brethren would haue ſlain: when he made

and without all ſecond cauſes or meanes. Like as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended

and speak of some deliuerances which they haue had; when they
haue béene manifeſtlie preſerued beſides and without ſecond

in péeces with diſcords of opinions and féeleth the crueltie of ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants;
this pſalme promiſeth her deliuerance from the wicked

as the viper is with the palme leaues nourished, and with the

yet in the courſe of the ſame ſermon &amp; conference of other

What is more to be amazed at, then when the ſon of god wraſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
with death and Sathan, ſuffered himſelfe to be ouercome,
laieth downe his life before theſe enemies, and while he is ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
conquereth? So a ſpeciall miracle it is, that Chriſt, dying
like a man vpon the croſſe, did the third day riſe againe from
death and (out of the graue cloſed vp) after this with immortall
fleſh aſcended vnto heauen, and ſitteth at the right hand of
God: what may be like notablie ſaid, yea or thought
of any other miracles in reſpect of theſe? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
belſſed be God, who onelie doth
theſe and other myracles.
So be it.</p>
