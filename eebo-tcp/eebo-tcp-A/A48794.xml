            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Lord <hi>Bacon's</hi> Iudgment of a Work of this nature.</head>
            <p>HIstory, which may be called just and perfect History, is of three kinds, according to the object it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth, or pretendeth to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent; for it either representeth a Time, a Person, or an Action, The first we call Chronicles, the second Lives, and the third Narrations, or Relations.</p>
            <p>Of these; although the first be the most compleat and absolute kind of History, and hath most estimation and glory; yet the second excelleth it in profit and use; and the third in verity and sincerity. For history of Times representeth the magnitude of Actions, and the publick faces or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portments of persons, and passeth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in silence the smaller passages and
<pb facs="tcp:64446:6"/>
motions of Men and Matters.</p>
            <p>But such being the workmanship of God, as he doth hang the greatest weight upon the smallest wyars, <hi>Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ima è minimis suspendens</hi>; it comes therefore to pass, that such Histories do rather set forth the pomp of busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, than the true and inward resorts thereof. But Lives, if they be well written, propounding to themselves a person to represent, in whom acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons both greater and smaller, publick and private, have a commixture, must of necessity contain a more true, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and lively representation.</p>
            <p>I do much admire that these times have so little esteemed the vertues of the Times, as that the writing of <hi>Lives</hi> should be no more frequent. For although there be not many So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Princes, or absolute Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, and that States are most collected into Monarchies; yet are
<pb facs="tcp:64446:6"/>
there many worthy personages that deserve better than dispersed Report, or barren Elogies: For herein the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of one of the late Poets is proper, and doth well inrich the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient fiction. For he feigneth, that at the end of the thread or web of every mans Life, there was a little Medal containing the person's name; and that <hi>Time</hi> waiteth upon the <hi>Sheers,</hi> and as soon as the Thread was cut, caught the Medials and carried them to the River <hi>Lethe</hi>; and about the bank there were many Birds fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up and down, that would get the Medials, and carry them in their beak a little while, and then let them fall into the River. Onely there were a few Swans, which if they got a Name, would carry it to a Temple where it was consecrate.</p>

Briefly, if it be true (as <hi>Polydore</hi> observes) that no man ever did rise with fewer virtues, it is true that few that ever fell from so high a place had lesser crimes objected against him: Though yet <hi>Polydore</hi> (for being at his first com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into <hi>England</hi> committed to Prison by him, as we have said) may be suspected as a partial Author.

In conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, As I cannot assent to those who thought him happy for enjoying the untimely compassion of the people a little before his end, so I cannot but account it a principal Felicity, that during his favour with the King, all things succeeded better than afterwards; though yet it may be doubted whether the Impressions he gave, did not occasion divers Irregularities which were observed to follow. <hi>He died</hi> Nov. <hi>29. 1529.</hi>

His Education was as Gentile as his Birth, only his mild spirit meeting with a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Master, his memory was weakened, and his spiritfulness allayed: but the austerity of the School was sweetned with the exercises of the Country, which his Father indulged him when he was young, and he indulged himself when aged; handling his great Horse as nimbly, his Bow and Net as dexterously as any man in his family. His Marriage withdrew him from the Colledge, and consequent Church-preferment, as the Kings did him from the Church it self.

Some will say the Protestants think no great gain to have him, and the Papists no loss to part with him; yet we must needs confess that he was a <hi>Wise Man,</hi> because he always consulted the Learned in the Laws about all his proceedings. He was a <hi>Good Man,</hi> witness <hi>Frescobald,</hi> whose mean Person he took notice of, whose small Kindness he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, whose Services he condescended to, whose Wants he relieved, and whose Debts he recovered: He was a <hi>Noble-man,</hi> because he refused another Mans Coat of Arms who was of his Name, saying, <hi>What shall I do with it? for he may pull it off my back at pleasure.</hi> In a word, He was so Mean be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he rose, so Worthy afterwards, that no Times had Raised but those more troublesome, none Ruined him but those most loose of <hi>Henry</hi> the viii. Some reserved Mens parts he compared to meat in a great <hi>Colchester</hi> Oyster, which would hardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite the pains of opening.— But infinitely was he taken with those who were (as he called them) like the Statues of <hi>Apollo,</hi> had a Launce in one Hand, and an Harp in another; that is, resolution to awe on the one side, and sweetness to oblige on the other.— Being much pleased likewise with the reflecting Man, who needs not the dull way of <hi>Persia,</hi> to keep a Boy behind him, to bid him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what he is, and what he ought to do; and with the devout Courtier: For as the Ennamel, which adorneth the Doves Neck, never shines so clear and glorious, as when the Sun looks upon it; so great Men are never so full of Majesty them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, as when they own the Majesty of God; never more Gods among Men, as when humble Men before God; who [as St. <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>France</hi> once

               <p>He loved not the Men that pedantically boasted their reading, but that rationally made use of it; not ridiculously upon all occasions vaunting the shreds of it, but skilfully to good purposes couch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the result and substance of it.— So the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable old Man <hi>Epictetus,</hi> as <hi>Lucian</hi> calls him that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Stoick, whose Lamp was preserved as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, and sold for 3000. Drachmas, would say, [<hi>Encheir c.</hi> 16.] that Sheep bring not their grass to their Shepherd, to shew him how much they have eaten, but concocting their meat inwardly do bring forth Wool and Milk.— True learning is the improvement of other Mens studies and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences by our own meditation, adding to that frame by consideration, which they had built from the ground by many Ages observation.</p>

But as these Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons again were not admitted by divers learned and able Persons, so he got him many Enemies, who at last procured his fall; but not before he had obtained suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively the Dignities of Master of the Rolls, Baron, Lord Privy Seal, Vicegerent to the King in Spiritualities, Knight of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> Great Chamberlain of <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>Four things a man went to Dine with Sir <hi>Thomas Wiat</hi> for: 1. For his Generous Entertainment: 2. For his free and knowing discourse of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi>; an in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For his quickness in observing, his civility in entertaining, his dexterity in employing, and his readiness in encouraging every mans peculiar parts
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:64446:49"/>
and inclinations. 4. For the notice and favour the King had for him. So ready was he to befriend worthy men, and so ready was the King to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his friend; that when a man was newly prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, they said, <hi>He had been in Sir</hi> Thomas Wiat's <hi>Closet.</hi> Happy is the Prince that hath a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>His Wit pleased the King, and his Wisdome ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him: He could not be without his Advice at the Council-table, nor without his Jests in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence-chamber: where yet he observed his <hi>decorum</hi> so exactly, that his Majesty could by no means win him one night to dancing; this being his grave re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, <hi>That he who thought himself a wise man in the day-time, would not be a fool at night</hi>: otherwise none carryed himself more handsomely, none con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed more ingeniously and freely, none discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed more facetiously or solidly. In a word, it was his peculiar happiness, that his deportment was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther too severe for King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth's time, nor too loose for <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh's; neither all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney nor all gall, but a sweet mixture and tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of affability and gravity, carrying an equal measure of Sir <hi>Thomas More</hi>'s ingenuity in his head, and Sir <hi>Thomas Cromwel</hi>'s wisdome in his heart; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually fashioned for discourse and business: in the last whereof, he was active, but not troublesome; in the first, merry, but innocent.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:64446:49"/>A Jest if it hit right, may do more good then so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Counsels. <hi>Archee</hi> made King <hi>Iames</hi> sensible of the danger the Prince was in, in <hi>Spain,</hi> by telling him that he came to change Caps with him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Why?</hi> said the King. <hi>Because thou hast sent the Prince into</hi> Spain, <hi>from whence he is never like to return. But</hi> (said the King) <hi>what wilt thou say when thou seest him come back again? Marry</hi> (saith he) <hi>I will take off the Fools Cap which I now put upon thy head for sending him thither, and put it on the King of</hi> Spains <hi>for letting him return.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Jest of Sir <hi>Thomas Wiat</hi>'s began that Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which the seriousness of all <hi>Christendome</hi> could not commence. King <hi>Henry</hi> was at a loss concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Divorce, which he no less passionately desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, than the Pope warily delayed: <hi>Lord,</hi> saith he, <hi>that a man cannot repent him of his sin, but by the Popes leave!</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> hinted, Doctor <hi>Cranmer</hi> opened, and the Universities of <hi>Europe</hi> made the way to Reformation.</p>
               <p>His Majesty was another time displeased with <hi>Wolsey,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> ups with a story of the <hi>Curs baiting of the Butchers Dog,</hi> which contained the whole method of that great mans ruine.</p>
               <p>The Pope was incensed, Christian Princes were enraged, and the numero<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:64446:50"/>
no such in</hi> England. <hi>Yes, Sir,</hi> said Sir <hi>Thomas, the Provostship of</hi> Eaton, <hi>where a man hath his Diet, his Lodging, his Horse-meat, his Servants wages, his Riding-charge, and an</hi> 100 l. per annum <hi>besides.</hi> What <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh said of one Kingdome, <hi>i. e. France,</hi> may be true of all, That they want one thing, <hi>i. e. Truth.</hi> Few Kings have such dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet Courtiers as Cardinal <hi>Wolsey,</hi> to look into things deeply; fewer so faithful Servants as Sir <hi>Thomas Wiat,</hi> to report things as they see them, honestly.</p>
               <p>His Jests were always confined to these Rules:

                     <item>1. He never played upon a mans unhappiness or deformity; it being inhumane.</item>

               </p>
               <p>Forty years he said he lived by his industry; Twenty by his reputation, and Ten by favour. King <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh knew not how well this Gentleman could serve him, until he saw how effectually he did oppose him about the Tenth Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny raised for the War in <hi>Britain,</hi> which raised ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>York</hi>; where though the Rabble (that mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> who was to levy the Tax) had not his Countenance for their Practice, yet had they his Principle for their Rule, which was this, <hi>Before we pay any thing, let us see
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:64446:51"/>
whether we have any thing we can call our own to pay.</hi> So able, though reserved a Patriot, thought the wise King, would be an useful Courtier, and he that could do so well at the Bar, might do more at the Bench. Cardinal <hi>Morton</hi> was against his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement, as an incouragement to the Factious: (whose Hydra-heads grow the faster by being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off by Preferment, and not by an Ax) the King was for it, as the most probable way of weakening of them, as who, when the most sober and wise part of them draweth off, are but a rude multitude, and a rope of sand. When a Commoner, none so stiff for the subjects priviledg; when a Judge, none so firm to the Princes Prerogative: two things, (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, they fatally clashed of late) that are solid felicities together, and but empty notions asunder: for what is Prerogative but a great Name, when not exercised over a free people? and what is pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledg but a fond imagination, when not secured under a powerful King, that may keep us from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing slaves one to another by Anarchy, while we strive to be free from his Tyranny? That people is beyond president free, and beyond comparison happy, who restrain not their Sovereigns power to do them <hi>harm</hi> so far, as that he hath none left him to do them <hi>good.</hi> Careful he was of the Law; for he was a Judge: and as careful of his Sovereigns Right; for he was a Subject. No ominous clash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between Courts in his time; nor setting the Kings <hi>Conscience</hi> in <hi>Chancery</hi> against his Will in the <hi>Kings Bench.</hi> A man tells <hi>Aristides,</hi> to make him party in his cause, that his Adversary had abused him: <hi>I sit not here</hi> (saith that Impartial Judge) <hi>to right my self, but you.</hi> When a notorious enemy of

Judge <hi>Fineux</hi> had a cause depending before him, <hi>It might have gone against you, my friend,</hi> (said he) <hi>had you not been my Enemy</hi>: His Motto was; <hi>nemo prudem punit quia peccatum est sed ne peccetur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ten things, which are indeed ten of the most remarkable particulars of his life, raised him.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. An indefatigable industry, 1. In his reading, leaving behind him 23 <hi>Folio</hi>'s of Notes. 2. In his practice, bequeathing 3502 Cases he managed himself to his Executor.</item>
                  <item>2. A freedome of converse, as about his busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, none more close; so in company, none more open; having so compleat a command of himself, that he knew to a minute when to indulge, and to a minute too when to restrain himself.

                  <item>3. A rich and a well-contrived marriage, that at once brought him a large Estate, and a larger Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest: the same tie that allied him to his Wives Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, engaged him to <hi>many.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>4. A great acquaintance with Noble Families, with whose dependants he got in first, devoting an hour a day for their company; and at last with themselves, laying aside his vacation-leisure for their service. He was Steward of 129 Mannors at once, and of Councel to 16 Noble-men.</item>
                  <item>5. His Hospitality and Entertainments. None more close than he abroad, none more noble at home; where many were tied to his Table, more obliged by his company and discourse.</item>

Good Housholders overlook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Families: 3. And good School-masters educating Youth; this last, the most useful, though the most contemptible profession.</p>
               <p>All War was mischievous to learning (Arts as well as Laws, being suppressed by armes, the <hi>Muses Lawrel</hi> is no security to them against <hi>Mars</hi> his <hi>Thunder</hi>) except Sr. <hi>Anthonies,</hi> no mans Library being embezled; no mans study interrupted; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving learning for the Civilizing of that Nation which his armes had Conquered.</p>
               <p>An <hi>Athenian</hi> being asked what God was? said, <hi>He was neither Bow-man, nor Horse-man, nor Pike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, nor Footman, but one that knew how to command</hi> [<hi>all these.</hi>] Sir <hi>Anthony St. Leiger</hi> was neither Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier nor Scholar, nor Statesman, yet he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood the way how to dispose of all these to his Countries service, and his Masters honour; being all of them eminently, though none of them pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantickly and formally in himself.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Athenians</hi> (as <hi>Anaximander</hi> said) had good Laws, but used them ill; our Deputy had bad Laws, but governed by good.</p>
               <p>It was thought by many wise men, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posterous rigour and unreasonable severity which some men carried there before him, was not the least incentive that kindled and blew up into hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid flames the sparks of discontent, which wanted not pre-disposed fuel in that place; where despair was added to their former discontents, and the fears of utter extirpation to their wonted oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: It is too easie to provoke a people too prone

                  <hi>Standon</hi> in <hi>Hertfordshire</hi> was built by his Steward in his absence, far greater than himself desired, so that he never joyed therein; and died soon after, <hi>Anno</hi> 1587, in the 80 year of his Age.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> understood two things: 1. A Man: 2. A Dish of Meat; and was seldom deceived in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: For a Man, none more compleat then Sir <hi>Ralph,</hi> who was at once a most exquisite Writer, and a most valiant and experienced Souldier; qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications that seldom meet, (so great is the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance between the Sword and the Pen, the Coat of Mail and the Gown) yet divided this man and his time; his nights being devoted to contemplation, and his days to action. Little was his Body, but great his Soul; the more vigorous, the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted. Quick and clear were his thoughts, spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and resolute his performances. It was he that could not endure the spending of that time in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing one action, which might perform two; or that delay in performing two, that might have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed twenty. A great Estate he got honestly, and spent nobly; knowing <hi>that Princes honour them most, that have most; and the People them onely that employ most:</hi> A Prince hath more reason to fear money that is spent, than that which is hoorded; because it is easier for Subjects to oppose a Prince by Applause than by Armies. <hi>Reward</hi> (said Sir <hi>Ralph</hi> when he was offered a sum of money) <hi>should not empty the Kings Coffers; neither should Riches be the Pay of Worth, which are meerly the Wages of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour:</hi> He that gives it, em<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Two things he observed broke Treaties; <hi>Iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie,</hi> when Princes are successful; and <hi>Fear,</hi> when they are unfortunate. Power that hath need of none, makes all confederacies, either when it is <hi>felt,</hi> or when it is <hi>feared,</hi> or when it is <hi>envied.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Three things <hi>Cato</hi> repented of: 1. <hi>That he went by water when he might go by land.</hi> 2. <hi>That he trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Woman with a secret.</hi> 3. <hi>That he lost Time.</hi> Two things Sir <hi>Ralph</hi> relented for: 1. <hi>That he had communicated a secret to two.</hi> 2. <hi>That he had lost any hour of the morning, between four a clock and ten.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He learned in King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's time, as <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Instrument, what he must advise (in point of Religion) in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time, as an eminent Counsellour: His Maxime being this, <hi>That Zeal was the Duty of a private Brest, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration the Interest of a publick State.</hi> The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants Sir <hi>Ralph</hi>'s Conscience would have in the commencement of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> kept in hope; the Papists his Prudence would not have cast into Despair. It was a Maxime at that time in <hi>b</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther case, <hi>That France should not presume, nor Spain be desperate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He saw the Interest of this State altered six times, and died an honest Man: The Crown put upon four Heads, yet he continued a Faithful Subject: Religion changed, as to the publick constitution of it, five times, yet he kept the Faith.</p>

               <p>His knack was his <hi>foresight,</hi> which made that an Adviso in <hi>England,</hi> which was hardly a known de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign there: saying usually, <hi>His Master maintained not Embassadors so much to write</hi> Histories <hi>as</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies.

               <p>He was the first that said, <hi>Policy is not the learning of some Rules, but the Observation of Circumstances, with a present minde in all junctures of affairs; which</hi> (he would say) <hi>was their happiness only, that had good memories</hi>: For when one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>His stature was something tall, and procured him reverence; his temper reserved, and commanding security to his person and his business. <hi>He that knoweth to speak well, knoweth also where he must hold his peace,</hi> said the old <hi>Graecian: Think an hour before you speak, and a day before you promise,</hi> said this <hi>English-Roman.</hi> With <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour he prevailed for the Popes assistance, and with <hi>Maximilian</hi> for his Masters against the <hi>French.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Never was his Master <hi>Henry</hi> so high, as to set him above treating; nor his Sovereign <hi>Edward</hi> so low, as to make him afraid of War; although he looked upon the way of Treaties, as a retiring from fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like Beasts, to arguing like men; whose strength should be more in their understandings, than in their Limbs. <hi>I have</hi> (said a great Prince) <hi>greater confidence in my Reason than in my Sword; and am so resolved to yield to the first, that I thought neither my self nor others should use the second, if once we rightly understood one another.</hi> It's <hi>humane</hi> to use <hi>Reason</hi> rather than <hi>Force,</hi> and <hi>Christian</hi> to <hi>seek peace and ensue it.</hi>

So exact an account he gave Prince <hi>Edward</hi> of his Fathers Kingdome,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:64446:107"/>
and its Interest, that King <hi>Henry</hi> designed him for Secretary, and King <hi>Edward</hi> made him one.</p>
               <p>Three years he had that place; and in that three years did <hi>England</hi> more service, so great his Parts, Learning and Religion! more kindness, such his eminency in both! and gave the People more satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, such his Integrity and Dexterity! than all that went before him, and most that came after him. He was the first that brought in the use of a Diary, and his Pupil the next that practised it: His Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rism it was, That a dark and imperfect reflexion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Affairs floating in the memory, was like words dispersed and insignificant; whereas a compleat view of them in a Book, was like the same words pointed in a period, and made significant.</p>
               <p>Much did the Kingdome value him, but more the King: for being once desperately sick, the King care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully enquired of him every day; at last his Physician told him there was no hope for his life, being given over by him for a dead man: <hi>No,</hi> said the King, <hi>he will not die at this time; for this morning I begged his life from God in my Prayers, and obtained it.</hi> Which accordingly came to pass; and he soon after, against all expectation, wonderfully recovered. This (saith Doctor <hi>Fuller</hi>) was attested by the old Earl of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tington,</hi> (bred up in his childhood with King <hi>Edward</hi>) to Sir <hi>Tho. Cheeke,</hi> who <hi>anno</hi> 1654. was alive, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He was a stout and valiant Gentleman, a cordial Protestant, and his Family a Sanctuary of such Professors; <hi>Iohn Bale</hi> comparing him to the good Centurion in the Gospel, and gratefully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging him the cause of his conversion from a <hi>Carmelite.</hi> The memory of this good Lord is much (but unjustly) blemished, because <hi>Calis</hi> was lost the last of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> under his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: The manner was huddled up in our Chronicles, (least is best of bad business) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of this is the effect: The <hi>English</hi> being secure by reason of the last Conquest at St. <hi>Quintin,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> having notice thereof, he sate down before the Town at the time (not when Kings go forth to, but return from battle) of mid-winter, even upon <hi>New-years-day.</hi> Next day he took the two Forts of <hi>Risebank</hi> and <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-bridge,</hi> (wherein the strength of the City consisted) but whether they were undermined or overmoneyed, it is not decided, and the last left most suspicious.

The <hi>French</hi> re-entring the City the next Day, being <hi>Twelfth-day,</hi> the Lord <hi>Went<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi> Deputy thereof made but vain resistance, which (alas) was like the wrigling of a Worms tayl after the head thereof is cut off; so that he was forced to take what terms he could get, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Towns-men should depart (though plundered to a Groat) with their Lives, and himself with 49 more, such as the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> should chuse, should remain Prisoners to be put to ransome.</p>

The Lord <hi>Wentworth</hi> the second of <hi>Iune</hi> following, was so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly condemned for Treason, though unheard, as absent in <hi>France:</hi> which was not only against Christian Charity, but <hi>Roman</hi> Justice; <hi>Festus</hi> confessing it was not fashionable amongst them to deliver any Man to die, before he which is accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed have the accusers face to face, and have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence

It was well for this Lord that he was detained in <hi>France</hi> till his ransome was paid, and Queen <hi>Mary</hi> dead, who otherwise probably had lost his life, if he had had his liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> coming to the Crown, he found the favour, or rather had the justice to be tryed again, and was acquitted by his Peers; finding it no treachery, cowardise, or carelessness in him, but in Sir <hi>Iohn Harlston,</hi> and Sir <hi>Ralph Chamberlain,</hi> the one Governour of <hi>Risebank,</hi> the other of <hi>Calis</hi>-Castle: for which they were both condemned to die, though their Judgment was remitted.

               <p>SIr <hi>Clement Paston</hi> was a Souldier, and a Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers Son; Valour running in the Blood for three Generations, and maturated by Noble and Heroick Actions for Glory and Success.

He was the first that made the <hi>English</hi> Navy terrible, and the last that made our Army so: He took the Admiral of <hi>France:</hi> and saved him of <hi>England:</hi> 30000 Crowns he received by way of Ransome from the first, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Two Kings made use of his Person, and two Queens of his Counsel, which he gave even on his Death-bed. His advice was short, but resolute;

his words few, but pertinent: his discourse com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding, and Souldier-like: his word, the Decree of the <hi>Medes.</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth called him <hi>His Champion:</hi> the Protector, in <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth's time, <hi>His Souldier</hi>; Queen <hi>Mary, Her Sea-man</hi>; and Queen <hi>Elizabeth, Her Father.</hi> VVhen <hi>Wyat</hi> was overthrown, he would deliver himself up to a Gentleman, and therefore only to Sir <hi>Clement Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston.</hi>

               <p>The two great Interests of Souldiers is Pay and Honour: He mortgaged his Estate twice, to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them for the one; and pawn'd his credit at Court often, to encourage them for the other; getting his Commanders always power and authority enough to do their Masters business, but never enough to do their own.</p>
               <p>There being always a contest between the Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy and the Souldiers,
(<q>whom nothing recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciles, but downright force and necessity</q>)
it was death to his Followers to be irregular, because one of their miscarriages exasperates a million, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stastes a Kingdom; so necessary is a strict Discipline in the Camp, and an impartial Justice in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</p>
               <p>Outward occasions help Fortune, a Man's own temper makes it, when there be, as my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> writes, no stops or restiveness in a Man's mind, but that the wheels of that keeps even with those of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.

by an Act of Parliament?</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> asked him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>If the Parliament enacted that God should not be Lord, whether he should consent to it?</hi> And those words undid him. He saw that the Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was the Interest of <hi>England,</hi> as well as the Doctrine of Scripture; and therefore he carried it on in point of policy, as Archbishop <hi>Cranmer</hi> did in point of conscience. King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired his distinct reasoning, and stayed judgment; and Queen <hi>Anne Bullen</hi> was taken with his graceful eloquence, and ingenious discourses: In the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his plyant soul, that could answer all the turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and windings of business, was as reserved and solid as that of a demure States-man; in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as chearful and merry as that of a Debonair Courtier. He was the wisdome of the Court in the Presence, and its wit in the Closet; its Oracle there, and its pleasure here.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth made him one of his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gators, and King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth one of his Council: Under him he carried on the Protestant Religion in point of conscience, which others ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged in point of interest. He designed the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of the Reformation, and he set out its me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, than whom none more zealous in things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, none more moderate in things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. Active he was, but wary; stirring, but cautious. To him the Reformers resorted in point of Law, as to <hi>Cranmer</hi> and <hi>Ridley</hi> in point of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Such his Prudence, that the Protector made him his Friend; such his Integrity, that the King made him Chancellour: where his Decrees were just, his Dispatches quick, his Judgments speedy, his Sums of Debates <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But there is a Wheel in things, which undoeth all those that have not a Wheel that answereth it in their Souls; I mean a great capacity to comply and close with those grand Vicissitudes that with small and unobserved circumstances turn round the World, which this great Man was Master of, who had his Eye upon the turns, flexures and points of things and business, and his state and interest ready to correspond: He knew when to proceed, when to make a stand, and when to retire. It's said of

Grandees, <hi>That they are the first that find their own Griefs, and the last that find their Faults.</hi> Our Lord was quick in both, and hath taught us this, <hi>That certainly Men of great fortunes are strangers to themselves, and while they are in the puzzle of business have no time to tend the welfare either of Body or Soul; and that they must with-draw from this World, before they retire into another:</hi> For, <hi>Illi mors gravis incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, qui not us nimis omnibus, ignotus moritur sibi.</hi>

               <p>HE had his Birth at <hi>Abingdon,</hi> and his Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at <hi>Oxford:</hi> His Birth commended him to <hi>All-Souls,</hi> and his Breeding to the Court: His Study was like his Inclination, rather active than contemplative, his present thoughts foreseeing and providing for his future Employments. But Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry and Parts may prepare a Man, it is opportunity and occasion that must advance him; and never had a Man fairer opportunity, never made a Man better use of it.</p>
               <p>None but Mr. <hi>Mason</hi> would the University pitch upon, to complement <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth; none but Mr. <hi>Mason</hi> could please him, although he was as great a <hi>Scholar</hi> as he was a <hi>King,</hi> and as much an Humorist as both: as he was inclined, so he studied; as
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:64446:114"/>
he studied, so he writ; not with a Pedants imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, but a States-man's prudence: so elegant was his Latine, that a Critick would have advanced him Professor; so various his Learning, that <hi>Cranmer</hi> would have preferred him Prebend; and yet so grave and wise the matter and composure of his speech, that the King designed him a States-man.</p>
               <p>When King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth came to <hi>Oxford,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> is deputed to congratulate his coming: who considering that a Man cannot every Day speak to Kings, contrived (saith my Author) the matter of his speech most Man-like, politick and pertinent, the phrase of it polite and majestick; so that what with his comely presence, his becoming carriage, his flowing expression, his graceful elocution, he gained that applause from the Court and University, that the one was as eager to have him, as the other was loth to part with him: the University was proud of him, but King <hi>Henry</hi> commanded him, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth of him in Forein parts, to add practical ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience to his speculative studies: It was the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent way of that time, to pick out the choice youths of both Universities, and maintain them some years abroad, to make such Observations as might render them serviceable at home<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>He that had seen the mysteries of four Courts,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:64446:116"/>
might be trusted with those of one, as he was in King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's time, in the capacity of a Privy Counsellour; and in <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth's, in the Trust of chief Secretary. At the Board, none clearer in his Proposals; in his Office, none quicker for Dispatch: <hi>Let me hear Sir Iohn Mason,</hi> said the King; <hi>Let us to Sir Iohn Mason,</hi> said the Subjects: so much the reputation of his prudent integrity with the one, and of his familiar access with the other!</p>
               <p>Four things he said kept him in, under all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions, during the four Princes Reigns whom he served:
<list>
                     <item>1. That he thought few Things would save a Man.</item>
                     <item>2. That he was always intimate with the exactest Lawyer, and ablest Favourite.</item>
                     <item>3. That he spake little, and writ less.</item>
                     <item>4. That he had attained to something which each party esteemed serviceable to them, and was so mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, that all thought him their own.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>When a compleat man, he was called home, to be first Clerk of the Council, a place of great Trust; secondly, Secretary of State, a place of great Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment; thirdly, Master of the Requests, an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of great Dispatch and Business; and fourthly, Treasurer of the Houshold, an Employment of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant care.</p>
               <p>No Age wanted an able man more, no Age had one more willing to secure the Universities, than that which chose him to be Chancellour of <hi>Oxford,</hi> at the same time that his Prince made him Treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of the Houshold.

Loth was <hi>Oxford</hi> to part with him when a Scholar, glad to entertain him a States-man, with a power to protect her, well tempered with Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to love her; he who is now the <hi>Father</hi> being lately the <hi>Son</hi>; maintained by a part of it, as he now maintained the whole. That was a scrambling time, when it was <hi>catch who catch can.</hi> I find not any particular favour conferred, or benefaction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed by him in person on the University; but this great good he did, That his Greatness kept others from doing any harm. Many hungry Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers had hopes to catch Fish, (and Fish it would be, whatever came into their Nets) on this turning of the Tide, and alteration of Religion: How easie was it for covetousness in those times to quarrel the Colledge-Lands into superstition!

He had a peculiar way of satisfying suiters by plain dealing and dispatch: he would di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide all suits either into matter of Equity, or a suit of Controversie; or into matter of Desert, or a suit of Petition: In the first he had his Referrendaries, to see the matter compounded between both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, rather than carried by either: In the second, he preferred all suitably to their Abilities.

He made his course regular, that Men might know what to expect; but not peremptory, that Knaves might not know how to impose upon him: always ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing himself well, when he digressed from his Rule. Preserve the right of his place he would, but not stir Questions of Jurisdictions; rather as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming his right in silence, and <hi>de facto,</hi> then voice it with claims and challenges. He directed in most Affairs, but was busie in none: none readier to give, none readier to take helps and advices. His speech was more discreet than eloquent; rather particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly suitable to the present things and persons, than generally orderly and artificial. He could speak quick and deep too, never using many circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, lest he were tedious; ever some, lest he were blunt: so warily did he deliver what he knew, that he was sometimes thought to know what he did

               <p>By diligence and moderation, with their gentle degrees and augmentations, and his own watchful observance, he climbed to Excellency. A man is neither good, nor rich, nor wise at once; it being a double work to be great: 1. To remove Obstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and accommodate Adversaries: 2.

Although he despised the Flatterers praise, as base; and avoided the Cunnings, as dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous; yet he would say of a deserved Fame, That being nothing, or but ayr at best, it doth all: for it's sufficient to breed Opinion, and Opinion brings on substance.</p>

               <p>SIr <hi>Iohn Ieffrey</hi> was born in <hi>Sussex,</hi> where he left behind him a fair Estate to his Daughter. He so profited in the Study of our Municipal Law, that he was preferred secondary Judge of the Common Pleas, and thence advanced by Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> in <hi>Michaelmas</hi>-Term, the Nineteenth of her Reign, to be Lord Chief Baron of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer: which place he discharged for the Term of two years, to his great commendation. He left one Daughter and Heir, married to Sir <hi>Edward Montague,</hi> (since Baron of <hi>Boughton</hi>) by whom he had but one Daughter, <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> married to <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Barty</hi> Earl of <hi>Lindsey,</hi> Mother to the truly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable <hi>Montague</hi> Earl of <hi>Lindsey,</hi> and Lord great Chamberlain of <hi>England.</hi> This worthy Judge di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the 21. of Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>

               <p>This was he who was called the Plodding Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, whose industry perfected Nature, and was perfected by experience. He read not to argue only; for that is vanity: nor to believe and trust; for that is easiness: nor to discourse; for that is idle: but to weigh and consider; for that is pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. He had his Studies for pleasure and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacy, for ornament and converse, and for judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and business. To spend too much time on his Book, was sloth; to talk by Book, was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected; and to act by it, was humoursome and Scholar-like.</p>

                  <item>4, A great happiness in all the four faculties that make a Lawyer: 1. A sharp invention, and clear apprehension to search all the circumstances of a case propounded. 2. Judgment to examine and weigh the particulars invented and apprehended: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>or truth lieth in things, as Gold in Mines. 3. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory to retain what is judged and examined. 4. A prompt and ready delivery of what is conceived and retained, set out with ingenuity and gravity. <hi>Oratio prompa non audax.</hi> What he said, was close and pinching, and not confident and earnest; allowing passion not to <hi>disturb</hi> either the method or delivery of his discourse, but to <hi>quicken</hi> it. To speak well and much, he said, was not the work of one man: yet if a Philosopher be eloquent, said <hi>Cicero,</hi> we must not despise him; if he be not, he must not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it, so that he can comprehend in words what he conceiveth, and speak them plainly, that he may be understood. His Latine and <hi>French</hi> were Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical, his Rhetorick Natural, his Logick Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: The first, opened the terms; the second, pressed the Vigour; the last, collected and disposed of the Axiomes, Grounds, and Rules of the Law, and all prepared him for that comprehensive Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession: in the ashes whereof, the sparks of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sciences were raked up.</item>

                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:64446:121"/>His gesture and habit was grave, but not affected: speaking as much to the eye, as his tongue did to the ear: (the gesture being a great discoverer of the constitution, and a great direction to business: what a man misseth in the speech, he may sometimes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Sir <hi>Iohn</hi>'s inclination was studious; his mind, constant, solid, and setled, and able to dive into the Whirl-pools of that intricate and perplexed fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty; his thoughts being <hi>orderly,</hi> and his conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions <hi>methodical:</hi> his search comprehensive, avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Epitomes, as the banes of Learning. <hi>Nullu: illi per otium dies exit, partem noctium studiis vindicat; non vacat somno, sed succumbit, &amp; oculos vigilia fati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatos cadentes<expan>

                     <item>1. By caution, ingeniously and discreetly waving and putting off things improper.</item>
                     <item>2. By colour, making his Defects his Virtues, and his Faults his Endowments. And,</item>

               </p>
               <p>He proposed to himself five things to enquire
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:64446:122"/>
into, in order to that compleatness he arrived unto:
<list>
                     <item>1. The ancient Maximes and Principles, or the more ancient Customs that make up the Common Law of <hi>England.</hi>

                     <item>3. The particular Priviledges, Liberties, Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities and Usages of Counties, Burroughs, Cities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that do swerve from this Law.</item>
                     <item>4. The ancient Grounds and Reasons (as far as History can direct) of all these: our Law being an exact Reason.</item>
                     <item>5. The most satisfactory explanations of the Law: 1. From Commentaries, as <hi>Bractons:</hi> 2. Abridgments, as <hi>Stathams:</hi> 3. History, as the years and terms of the Common Law: And 4. From more particular Tracts, that handled their peculiar subjects, as <hi>Fortescue, Glanvil, Britton, Fleta, Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleton,</hi> which he thought not unprofitable to read, though dangerous to rely upon: (with the Lord <hi>Cooke,</hi> not liking those that stuff their mindes with wandering and masterless reports: For, as he said, they shall find them too soon to lead them to error:) Beginning with the terms of Art, and then to the matter; perusing what is antiquated, and obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving what is suitable to the present constitution and complexion.
It's my Lord <hi>Cook</hi>'s Rule, <q>That for the most part the latter Judgments and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions are the surest, and therefore fittest to season a man withal in the beginning; both for settling of his Judgment, and retaining them in memory; yet as he goeth on, out of the old fields must spring and grow the new Corn.</q>

There are small matters that win great commendation, because they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually in use; whereas the occasion of any great action cometh but on festivals, and it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to attain so much ceremony and courtship, not to despise it.</hi>
He had a way of conveying effectual and imprinting passions among comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, suitable to persons and business: He had his familiarity to Inferiors, that made him not cheap:

               <p>Nature did this person some wrong in his Body, but made him amends in his Soul: the <hi>fails</hi> of the one, are <hi>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And if that will not serve, to declare to some person of estimation, with whom you are best acquainted, that as you are loth to offend the French King by reason of his kind usage of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Furthermore, remember when you may conveniently be absent from the Court, to tarry with Sir <hi>William Pickering,</hi> to be instructed by him how to use your self.

I told you how many I thought convenient you should keep. After you have ordered your things at <hi>Paris,</hi> go to the Court, and learn to have more intelligence if you can; and after to the Wars, to learn somewhat to serve us. By your Letters of the second and fifteenth of <hi>April,</hi> we perceive that you were at <hi>Nancy,</hi> ready to go together with Mr. <hi>Pickering</hi> to the French Camp; and to the intent you might be better instructed how to use your self in these Wars, we have thought good to advertise you of our pleasure therein. First, we would wish you; as much as you may conveniently, to be in the French Kings presence, or at least in some part of his Army, where you shall perceive most business to be; and that for two causes: One is, because you may have more experience in the Wars, and see things as might stand you in stead another day: The other is, because you might be more profitable in the Language. For our Embassador, who may not wear Harness, cannot well

come to those places of danger, nor seem so to serve the French King, as you may, whom we sent thither for that purpose. It shall be best for you therefore hereafter, as much as you may, to be with the French King<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> had a <hi>moving</hi> beauty that waited on his whole Body, as that standing one doth upon the Face and Complexion: Such a grace and comeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness waited on His Noble Men, as exacted a liking, if not a love from all that beheld him.</p>
               <p>A midling Clarity and quickness is best in Wine, that is, neither to thick upon the Lees, nor yet too quick: our Knights comportment and carriage was neither dull nor vapouring, neither gross nor affected, but of a becoming temper, at equal di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance with the Clown and the Pedant, what's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, and what's invidious. 3. But both these were set off with his Person, of a middle sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, neither tall to a formidableness, nor short to a contempt: straight and proportioned, vigorous and active, with that pure blood and spirits that flowed and flowred within his swelling Veins, and disposed him to those natural and innocent, those manly and noble Exercises of Dancing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, I say, which he was not exquisite in, for that is vanity: nor ignorant of, for that's meanness: but a graceful exercise, (wherein he was carelesly easie,

as if it were rather natural motion, than curious and artificial practising) which endeared his severer Vertues to that place where the worth that riseth must be complaisant and pleasing, as well as service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and useful. But the favour which proceeds from personal grace and comeliness, although it seem to be doubly united, yet it is that which is soonest dissolved and dissipated, there being nothing so inconstant as mens humours, which not onely change through Ages, but also by some small occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion or accident which may arise: Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore brought himself into Court by what humour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but kept himself in there by those things that did oblige him; and stood not upon his Majesties pleasure, but his Interest; adding to his more aiery Courtships, more solid Employments. From the softer Court therefore we must follow him to the Camp, and that before <hi>Terwyn,</hi> where we finde him daring and active: 1. In skirmishing the French every day; 2.

Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> was commanded with 1500 men to cut off the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy to <hi>Terwyn:</hi> which he performed with that speed and success, that when the King saw him, he said, <hi>I, I, Sir</hi> John, <hi>while we are fooling, the Town is relieved.

               <p>HIs Family had not endeared its self to the antient Kings by its service, nor his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father himself to King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh by his Relation, more than <hi>He</hi> did <hi>Himself</hi> to King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth by his Merit. He was a great Pattern of antient Vertue, that in the greatest For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune enjoyed the least Liberty: Vigilant and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: One whose Power was attended with Sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, (<hi>there was an Eye in the ancient Scepters</hi>) and his sollicitude with Temperance; (he that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands himself, commands the World too.) While some mens imprudent integrity can do no harm, and others base cunning can do no good; Sir <hi>William</hi>'s Prudence and integrity was equally able for both, as there was occasion. Very close and successful were his and my Lord <hi>Shefield's</hi> Negotiations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad: Very resolute and manly his Conduct at home. He was one of the twenty four Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours to <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth while he lived, and one of the sixteen Executors of his Will when he died. All great undertakers must avoid softness and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minacie, the bane of great Natures and Actions: For where there is love and pleasure, there is fear; and where there is fear, there is that which enchains Generosity and confines Courage.</p>
               <p>He had his double Diary; the first for Actions, the second for Observations upon them: And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed his and Sir <hi>William Kingston</hi>'s Manuscripts

The man is compleat that hath a Head and a Heart.</p>
               <p>As to the Faction in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s time, he would not concern himself, looking on accusations in a Commonwealth as great advantages to check am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, and vent discontent; that the one may not aspire too dangerously, nor the other break out too irregularly. And as little concern'd was he in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Will; his business being ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>He was a throughly advised man; one that gazed not on the issues, but enquired into the reasons and spring of Actions.</p>
               <p>Very useful he was in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Council, and no less in King <hi>Philip</hi>'s War, where he got St. <hi>Quintin</hi> for him, and a lasting Renown for himself: who died in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time, and left this plain Character behinde, <hi>That he was a noble Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, of a trusty, a free and an open Nature.</hi>

in the Town, and therefore he must set up two Gallows. The Mayor did so. After Dinner Sir <hi>William Kingston</hi> thanks him for his Entertainment, and then desires him to bring him to the Gallows: where when they were come, Sir <hi>William</hi> asked him, Whether they were strong enough; <hi>I, I'll warrant thee,</hi> saith the Mayor. <hi>Then,</hi> saith Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam, get you up upon them, I hope,</hi> saith the Mayor, <hi>you do not mean as you speak.

                  <item>2. A Miller that had been very active in the late Rebellion, fled, and left another to take his Name upon him. Sir <hi>William Kingston</hi> calls for the Miller, His Servant tells him that he was the Man. <hi>Then,</hi> saith he, <hi>you must be hanged.

               <p>Having engaged his Majesties Person at home, he had the Honour to represent it abroad: where his Commission was to complement the French King about his Liberty, but his Business to observe the state of that place: Where he saw that a Kingdom governed by a Prince who hath under him other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent Lords, as that of <hi>France,</hi> is no longer safe, than those Lords are either in Humour, or in Purse; being always in danger either from their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content or corruption: 2.

His favour was eminent with his Mistress, and his Alliance strong with her States-men. No man served his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign more faithfully, none secured himself more wisely. <hi>Leicester</hi> seemed wiser than he was, <hi>Bacon</hi> was wiser than he seemed to be; <hi>Hunsdon</hi> neither <hi>was</hi> nor <hi>seemed</hi> wise.

more prudent than the opening of it; and judging it more wisdome to <hi>satisfie</hi> the world with the old Law, <hi>That the Crown takes away all defects</hi>; than to perplex it with new disputes, <hi>Whether Queen</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeth <hi>were Legitimate.</hi> State-miscarriages are rather to be privately connived at, than publickly redressed; the remedy it may be doing no more ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice than putting the people in minde of the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hap.

               </head>
               <p>THe Lord <hi>Leicester</hi> was the youngest son then living of <hi>Dudley</hi> Duke of <hi>Northumberland</hi>: he was also one of the first to whom Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> gave that honour to be master of the horse. He was a very goodly person, and singular well featured, and all his youth well favoured, and of a sweet aspect, but high foreheaded, which was taken to be of no discommendation: but towards his latter end grew high-coloured and red-faced. The Queen made him Earl of <hi>Leicester</hi> for the suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of his Ancestors sake, both in her Fathers and Sisters Reigns. The Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> his death in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and the marriage of his Lady yet living, deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly stains his commendation. But in the Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his Letters and Writings, there was not known a Stile or Phrase more religious, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of the streams of Devotion. He was sent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour by the Queen to the United States of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> where we read not of his wonders; for they say, <hi>Mercury,</hi> not <hi>Mars,</hi> in him had the predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minancy. To the Policy he had from <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland</hi> his Father, and the Publican <hi>Dudley</hi> his Grandfather, he added, it is said, Magick and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strology; and to his converse with Wise men, his familiarity with Wizards. Indeed he would say, <hi>A States-man should be ignorant of nothing, but should have all notices either within his own or his Confidents command.</hi>

He trusted not his Familiars above a twelve-month together, but either transported them for Forreign services, or wafted them to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world. His Ambition was of a large extent, and his head-piece of a larger. Great was his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on <hi>England,</hi> greater on <hi>Scotland,</hi> and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of all on <hi>Ireland</hi> and the <hi>Netherlands</hi>; where this close <hi>Genius</hi> acted invisibly, beyond the reach of friends, or the apprehension of enemies. Declining an immediate opposition in Court-factions, the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sir raised always young Favourites to outshine the old ones: so balancing all others that he might be Paramount himself. The modern policy and practices were but shallow to <hi>his</hi>; who by promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Queens match, could hinder it; who could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coy <hi>Hunsdon</hi> to <hi>Berwick, Pembroke</hi> to <hi>Wales, Sid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi> to <hi>Ireland</hi>; while what with his great Train, what with his growing Popularity, he was called the <hi>Heart</hi> of the Court.</p>

               <p>His Interest was Popery, until my Lord <hi>North</hi> put him upon Puritanism, but his Religion neither: he promoted the French and Polish match at Court, and disparaged them in the Country.

<q>You are accused, but not condemned. You say

you are a Queen; be it so: if you are innocent, you wrong your Reputation in avoiding tryal.

To examine your innocence are these honourable, prudent, and upright Commissioners sent: glad will they be with all their hearts if they may return and report you guiltless. Believe me, the Queen her self will be much affected with joy, who affirmed to me at my coming from her, that never any thing befel her more grievous, than that you were charged with such a crime: Wherefore lay aside the bootless pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of Royal Dignity, which here can be of no use to you, appear in Iudgement, and shew your Innocence; lest by avoiding tryal, you draw upon your self suspition, and lay upon your Reputation an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal blot and aspersion.</q>

His Hall was full most commonly, his Gates always; the one with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Gentry and Yeomen, who were his Retainers in love and observance, bringing good stomacks to his Table, and resolved hearts for his service; the holding up of his hand in the Northern business, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as affectual as the displaying of a Banner: The other with the, 1.

Industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Poor, whose craving was prevented with doles, and expectation with bounty; the first being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with meat, the second with money, and the third with employment. In a word, Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> observes, That Hospitality lieth buried since 1572, in this Earls Grave: whence may that Divine Power raise it, that shall raise him; but before the last Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now the Landlord hath the sweat of the Tenants brow in his Coffers, then he had the best blood in his Veins at his command.</p>
               <p>That grand word, <hi>On mine Honour,</hi> was security enough for a Kingdome, and the onely Asseverati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he used. It was his priviledge, that he <hi>need</hi> not swear for a testimony; and his renown, that he <hi>would</hi> not for his honour. Great was this Families esteem with the people, and eminent their favour with their Soveraigns; as which ever bestowed it self in obliging their Liege-people, improving their interest, and supporting their Throne: for though they were a long time great Kings of <hi>Man</hi> and Hearts, yet were they as long faithfull subjects to <hi>England.</hi>

                  <hi>WAlter Mildmay,</hi> that upright and most advised man, was born at <hi>Chelmsford</hi> in <hi>Essex,</hi> where he was a younger-son to <hi>Thomas Mildmay,</hi> Esquire. He was bred in <hi>Christs-Colledge</hi> in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where he did not (as many young Gentlemen) study onely in Complement, but seriously applyed himself to his Book. Under King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, and King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth, he had a gainful Office in the Court of Augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations: during the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> he pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised the Politick Precept, <hi>Bene vixit, qui bene la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuit.</hi> No sooner came Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to the Crown, but he was called to State-employment; and it was not long before he was made Chancellour of the exchequer. It is observed, That the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer never fareth ill but under a good Prince; such who out of Conscience will not oppress their People, whilst Tyrants pass not for that they squeeze out of their Subjects. Indeed Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was very careful not to have her Coffers swelled with the Consumption of her Kingdome, and had conscientious Officers under her; amongst whom, Sir <hi>Walter</hi> was a principal one. This Knight, sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of Gods blessing on his estate, and knowing that, <hi>Omne beneficium requirit Officium,</hi> cast about to make his return to God.

the Generous Resolution, (which the pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful piety of St. <hi>Paul</hi> propounds to himself, <hi>viz.</hi>) <hi>Not to build on another mans foundation,</hi> but on his own cost he erected a new Colledge in <hi>Cambridge</hi> by the name of <hi>Immanuel.</hi> A right godly Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man he was; a good man, and a good Citizen; though some of his back friends suggested to the Queen that he was a better Patriot than Subject: and he was over-popular in Parliaments, insomuch that his Life set <hi>sub nubecula,</hi> under a Cloud of a Royal Displeasure: yet was not the Cloud so great, but that the beams of his Innocence meeting those of the Queens Candour, had easily dispelled it, had he survived longer, as appeared by the great grief of the Queen, professed for the loss of so grave a Councellour, who leaving two Sons and three Daughters, died <hi>anno Domini</hi> 1589.</p>

               <p>SIr <hi>Henry Sidney,</hi> eminent for his son Sir <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip,</hi> and famous for his own Actions, was born well, and bred better: His Learning was equal to his Carriage, his Carriage to his Good Nature, his Good Nature to his Prudence, his Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to his Resolution. A little he learned at School, more at the University, most at Court. His Reading was assiduous, his Converse exact, his

                  </gap>servations close: His Reason was strong, and his Discourse flowing. Much he owed to his Studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness at home, more to his Experience abroad, where Travel enlarged and <hi>consolidated</hi> his Soul. His own Worth fitted him for Advancement, and his Alliance to my Lord of <hi>Leicester</hi> raised him to it. Merit must capacitate a man for Interest, and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest must set up merit. His person and his Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry invested him Knight of the Garter, his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration and Wisdome President of <hi>Wales.</hi> His Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution and Model of Government made him Lord Deputy of <hi>Ireland</hi>; a people whom he first studied, and then ruled; being first master of their humour, and then of their Government. Four things he said would reduce that Country: A Navy well fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, to cut off their correspondence with <hi>Spain</hi>; An Army well paid, to keep up Garrisons; Laws well executed, to alter their Constitutions and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nures; A Ministry well setled, to civilize and instruct them; and an unwearied Industry to go through all.</p>
               <p>Nine things he did there to eternize his Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>

Secretary <hi>Bourns</hi> Son kept a Gentlemans Wife in <hi>Shropshire</hi>; when he was weary of her, he caused her Husband to be dealt with to take her home, and offered him 500 <hi>l.</hi> for reparation. The Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man went to Sir <hi>Henry Sidney</hi> to take his advice; telling him, <hi>That his Wife promised now a new life, and to say the truth five hundred pounds would be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry seasonable at that time.

When a man fretted against himself or other, <hi>My Friend,</hi> he would say, <hi>take it from me, a weakman complains of others, an unfortunate man of himself, but a wise man neither of others nor of himself.</hi> It was his Motto, <hi>I'll never threaten.</hi> To threaten an Enemy, is to instruct him; a Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, is to endanger my person; an Inferiour, is to disparage my conduct. Old servants were the Ornament and stay of his Family, for whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served a Copyhold when aged, a service when hopeful, an Education when pregnant. Twice was he sent underhand to <hi>France,</hi> and once to <hi>Scotland,</hi> to feel the pulse of the one; and to embroyl the other.

And the same thing is already made good to the world by many of the Writings of godly and learned men, neither answered nor answerable by any of these new fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled Refiners.

Had he broughtless to the Court than he did, he might have carried away more than he brought: for he had a time for it, but he was an ill husband of opportunity. His handsome features took the most, and his neat parts the wisest at Court. He could smile Ladies to his service, and argue States-men to his designe with equal ease.

               <p>My Lord <hi>Hunsdon</hi> guarded the Queens person with 34000 foot, and 2000 horse; the Earl of <hi>Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester</hi> commanded the Midland Army of 22000 foot, and 1000 horse: Sir <hi>Roger Williams</hi> and Sir <hi>Richard Bingham</hi> were in the head of 20000 in the <hi>Thames</hi> mouth, and Sir <hi>Iohn Norris</hi> and Sir <hi>Francis Knowles</hi> with other Assistants sate in the Council of War to overlook all. Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> advised three things: 1. The Guarding of the Havens, 2. The Training of the Militia, and the preparing of them to be at an hours warning upon a signal given, which was then the firing of a Beacon. 3. That if the enemy did land, the Country should be laid waste before

him, the Train-bands alarming him day and night: Sir <hi>Francis</hi> added, 1, What shires and what num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers should assist each Coast, how the men should be armed, how commanded, and in what order they should fight. 2. That the Papists should not be massacred, as some would have it, but secured. 3. That the Deputy of <hi>Ireland</hi> should be instructed. 4. That the King of <hi>Scots</hi> should be engaged. 5. That Agents should be sent to the <hi>Netherlands</hi> and to <hi>France.</hi> And, 6. That the Queen should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the people with her own presence. Sir <hi>Iohn Norris</hi> died when he saw beyond others ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation and his own merit, the Lord <hi>Burge</hi> made Lord-Deputy, and himself but President of <hi>Munster</hi>; his great minde sinking under one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front from his Soveraign, which had born up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all the assaults of her enemies; leaving this honour behinde him, That he laid the best grounds of military practice in <hi>England</hi>

               <p>That he was but of a private capacity, and so safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be raised, as one that would neither outshine nor outdare his Patron, (<hi>Machiavil</hi> hath a Rule, (<hi>Disc. l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 2.) That it is a very great part of wisdome sometimes to seem a fool, and so lie out of the reach of <hi>Observation</hi> and <hi>Iealousie</hi>) appears from his Negotiations, that were either payment of money in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> a Merchants business; or taking security of the Merchants in <hi>France,</hi> a Scriveners part; or pacifying the tumult in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

His Grand Case,
<pb n="625" facs="tcp:64446:256"/>
as that great Historian layeth it, is briefly this; Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Protestants thought themselves in danger while the Queen of Scots was alive; many Papists thought themselves undone while she was imprisoned: these last press her to some dangerous undertakings; of the first, some were for securing, others for transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and a third party for poysoning her: to which purpose many Overtures were made, though yet none durst undertake it that had either estate or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to lose; being so wise as not to understand what was meant by the strange Letters that were sent, else they might have faln into this Gentlemans fortune; who unadvisedly venturing between the honour and safety of his Soveraign, was ground to nothing betwixt the fear of one party, and the shame of the other.</p>

He would neither contest with his Soveraign, nor disparage himself; but clear himself as an honest man, and submit as a thankful servant, and a good subject.</p>

And also when the aforesaid <hi>Thomas Roper</hi> in the late war in the Kingdome of <hi>France</hi> at <hi>Brest,</hi> by exposing himself to the greatest perils, and shedding of his own blood, demonstrated his Courage to be unconquerable. Who also in the Voyage to <hi>Portugal,</hi> behaved himself valiantly and honourably: as also at <hi>Bergen</hi> in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> when it was besieged by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> approved himself a young man of invincible Valour in the defence thereof.

About which time, the said Earl

of <hi>Leicester</hi> bewrayed a meaning to plant him in the Queens favour: which was diversly interpreted by such as thought that great Artizan of Court to do nothing by chance, nor much by affection.

Notwithstanding, a noble report co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming home before him, at his return all was clear, and this excursion was esteemed but a Sally of youth. Nay, he grew every day more and more in her gracious conceit: whether such intermissions as these do sometimes foment affection; or that having committed a fault, he became the more obse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quious and plyant to redeem it; or that she had not

<q>
                        <l>And if thou should'st by Her be now forsaken,</l>

                  </p>
                  <p>As if he had been casting one eye back at the least to his former retiredness. But all this likewise quickly vanished, and there was a good while afer fair weather over-head. Yet still, I know not how, like a gathering of Clouds, till towards his latter time, when his humours grew tart, as being now in the Lees of favour, it brake forth into cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain suddain recesses; sometimes from the Court to <hi>Wansteed,</hi> otherwhiles unto <hi>Greenwich,</hi> often to his own Chamber, Doors shut, Visits forbidden; and which was worse, divers contestations (between) with the Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>WHen my Lord of <hi>Essex</hi> stood in favour, the Parliaments were calm: nay, I find it a true observation, that there was no impeachment of any Nobleman by the Commons from the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the sixth, until the eighteenth of King <hi>Iames,</hi> nor any intervenient preced<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>These two accidents precisely true, and known to few, I have reported as not altogether extravagant from my purpose, to shew how the Earl stood in certain perplexities, wherewith the Dukes days were not distracted. And this hath been the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical part (as it were) touching the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>The Earl was a pretty deal the taller, and much the stronger, and of the abler body: but the Duke had the neater limbs, and free delivery: he was also the uprighter, and of the more comely moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: for the E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If we touch particulars, the Duke exceeded in the daintiness of his leg and foot, and the Earl in the incomparable fairness and fine shape of his hands; which (though it be but femi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine praise) he took from his Father: for the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Air, the Earl had the closer and more reserved Countenance, being by nature somewhat more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitative, and (which was strange) never more than at meals, when others are least: Insomuch, as he was wont to make his observation of hims<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> which shewed, that when he listed he could license his thoughts.</p>
                  <p>The Duke on the other side, even in the midst of so many diversions, had continually a very pleasant and vacant face, (as I may well call it) proceeding no doubt from a singular assurance in his temper. And yet I must here given him a rarer Elogie, which the malignest eye cannot deny him, That certainly never man in his place and power, did entertain greatness more familiarly, nor whose looks were less tainted with his felicity; wherein I insist the rather, because this in my judgement was one of his greatest Vertues and Victories of himself.</p>
                  <p>But to proceed: in the attiring and ornament of their bodies, the Duke had a fine and unaffected politeness, and upon occasion costly, as in his Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>The Earl as he grew more and more attentive to business and matter, so less and less curious of cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: insomuch, as I do remember, those about him had a conceit, that possibly sometimes when he went up to the Queen, he might scant know what he had on: for this was his manner: His Chamber being commonly stived with Friends or Sui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="650" facs="tcp:64446:269"/>
he would make a step into his Closet, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a short prayer, he was gone: only in his Baths, he was somewhat delicate. For point of diet and lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury, they were both inordinate in their appetites, especially the Earl, who was by nature of so diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent a taste, that I must tell a rare thing of him (though it be but a homely note) that he would stop in the midst of any physical Potion, and after he had licked his lips, he would drink off the rest; but I am weary of such slight Animad versions.</p>
                  <p>To come therefore to the inward furniture of their minds, I will thus much declare.</p>
                  <p>The Earl was of good Erudition, having been placed at study in <hi>Cambridge</hi> very young by the Lord <hi>Burleigh</hi> his Guardian, with affectionate and deliberate care, under the oversight of Doctor <hi>Whitgift,</hi> then master of <hi>Trinity Colledge,</hi> and after Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi>; A man (by the way) surely of a most reverend and sacred memory, and (as I may well say) even of the Primitive temper, when the Church in lowliness of temper did flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish in high examples, which I have inserted as a due recordation of his vertues, having been much obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to him for many favours in my younger time.</p>
                  <p>About sixteen years of his age (for thither he came at twelve) he took the formality of master of Arts, and kept his publick Acts. And here I must not smother what I have received by constant In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, that his own Father dyed with a very cold conceit of him, some say through the affection to his second son <hi>Walter Devereux,</hi> who was indeed a diamond of the time, and both of an hardy and delicate temper and mixture: But it seemes, this Earl, like certain vegetables, did <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>d and open slow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
<pb n="651" facs="tcp:64446:269"/>
Nature sometimes delighting to play an after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>game as well as Fortune, which had both their turnes and tides in course.</p>
                  <p>The Duke was Illiterate, yet had learned at Court, first to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t and question well, and to supply his own defects by the drawing or flowing unto him of the best Instruments of experience and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, from whom he had a sweet and attractive manner, to suck what might be for the publick or his own proper use; so as the less he was favoured by the Muses, he was the more by the Graces.</p>
                  <p>To consider them in their pure Naturals, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Earls Intellectuall faculties to have been his stronger part, and in the Duke his Practical.</p>
                  <p>Yet all know, that he likewise at the first was much under the expectation of his after<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> proof; such a sudden influence therein had the Soveraign aspect. For their Abilities of discourse or pen, the Earl was a very acute and sound speaker when he would intend it; and for his Writings, they are beyond example, especially in his familiar Letters and things of delight at Court, when he would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit his serious habits, as may be yet seen in his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses and inventions of entertainment; and above all, in his darling piece of love, and self-love; his Stile was an elegant perspicuity, rich of phrase, but seldome any bold Metaphors, and so far from Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, that it rather wanted a little Elevation.</p>
                  <p>The Dukes delivery of his mind I conceive not to be so sharpe as solid and grave, not so solid and deep as pertinent, and apposite to the times and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions.</p>
                  <p>The Earl I account the more liberal, and the Duke the more magnificent; for I do not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

They were both great cherishers of Scholars and Divines; but it seems, the Earl had obtained of himself one singular point, that he could depart his affection between two extreams: for though he bare always a kind of filial reverence towards Dr. <hi>Whit gift,</hi> both before and after he was Archbishop; yet on the other side, he did not a little love and tender <hi>Master Cartwright,</hi> though I think truly, with la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>They were both fair-spoken Gentlemen, not prone and eager to detract openly from any man; in this the Earl hath been most falsly blemished in our vulgar Story: only against one man he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sworn all patience, namely <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> and would call him <hi>(per Excellentiam)</hi> the Syco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant (as if it had been an emblem of his name) even to the Queen herself, though of no small insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation with her; and one Lady likewise (that I may civilly spare to nominate, for her sex sake) whom he used to terme the Spyder of the Court: yet ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally in the sensitive part of their Natures the Earl was the worse Philosopher, being a great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senter and a weak Dissembler of the least disgrace: And herein likewise, as in the rest, no Good Pupill to my Lord of <hi>Leicester,</hi> who was wont to put all his passions in his pocket.</p>

little the swifter, and much the greater; for from a younger brothers mean estate, he rose to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est degree whereof a Subject was capable either in Title or Trust. Therein I must confess much more consortable to <hi>Charles Brandon</hi> under <hi>Henry the Eight,</hi> who was equal to him in both.</p>
                  <p>For matter of Donative and addition of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, I do not believe that the Duke did much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed him, all considered, under both Kings.</p>
                  <p>For that which the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> had received from her Majesty, besides the Fees of his Offices and the disposition of great Summes of money in her Armies, was (about the time of his Arraignment, when faults use to be aggravated with precedent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits) valued at three hundred thousand pounds sterling in pure gift for his onely use, to the Earl of <hi>Dorset</hi> then Lord Treasurer; who was a wise man, and a strict Computist, and not ill affected towards him. And yet it is worthy of note in the Margent of both Times, that the one was prosecuted with silence, and the other with murmur; so undoing a measure is popular judgement.</p>
                  <p>I cannot her omit between them a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in establishing of both their Fortunes and Fames.</p>
                  <p>For the first, the Duke had a care to introduce into neer place at the Court divers of his confident Servants, and into high places very sound and grave Personages.

<pb n="655" facs="tcp:64446:271"/>
that I think had ever been brewed from the beginning of the World, howsoever countenanced by a Libellous Pamphlet of a fugitive Physician e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in Print; and yet of this would not the Duke fuffer any answer to be made on his behalf, so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant he was to his own principles.</p>
                  <p>In their Military services the Characters of the Earls imployments were these, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His forwardest was that of <hi>Portugal,</hi> before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>

                  <p>His fortunatest peice I esteem the taking of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diz Malez,</hi> and no less modest; for there he wrote with his own hands a censure of his Omissions.</p>
                  <p>His jealousest imployment was to the relief of <hi>Calais</hi> besieged by the Cardinal Arch-duke: about which, there passed then between the Queen and t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>His Voiage to the <hi>Azores</hi> was the best, for the discovery of the Spanish weakness, and otherwise almost a saving Voiage.</p>
                  <p>His blackest was that to <hi>Ireland,</hi> ordained to be the Sepulchre of his Father, and the Gulph of his own Fortunes.</p>
                  <p>But the first in 88, at <hi>Tilbury-camp,</hi> was in my judgement the very poyson of all that followed; for there whilest the Queen stood in some doubt of a <hi>Spanish Invasion</hi> (though it proved but a Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice-dance upon our Waves) she made him in Field Commander of the Cavalry (as he was before in Court) and much graced him openly in view of the Souldiers and people, even above my Lord of <hi>Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester:</hi>
                     <pb n="656" facs="tcp:64446:272"/>
the truth is, from thenceforth he fed too fast.</p>
                  <p>The Dukes employment abroad in this nature, was onely in the Action of the <hi>Isle of Reez,</hi> of which I must note somewhat for the honour of our Country, and of his Majesties times, and of them that perished and survived, and to redeem it gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally from mis-understanding. Therefore after en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry amongst the wisest and most indifferent men; of that Action, I dare pronounce, that all Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances pondered, A tumultuary banding on our part, with one thousand in the whole on theirs rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to receive us with two hundred horse, with neer two thousand foot, and watching their best time of advantage, none of their foot discovered by us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, nor so much as suspected, and onely some of their Horse descried stragling, but not in any bulk or body: their Cavalry not a Troop of <hi>Eascoignors</hi> mounted in haste, but the Greater part Gentlemen of Family, and of pickt Resolution, and such as charged home both in Front and on both Flanks in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the very Sea; about <hi>sixscore</hi> of their two hundred horse strewed upon the Sand, and none of them but one killed with a great shot; and after this their foot likewise coming on to charge, till not liking the business they fell to flinging of stones, and so walked away:</p>
                  <p>I say, these things considered and laid together, we have great reason to repute it a great impression upon an unknown place, and a noble argument that upon occasion we have not lost our ancient vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour. Only I could wish that the Duke who then in the animating of the souldiers shewed them very eminent assurance of his valour, had afterwards

remembred that rule of <hi>Apelles, Manum de Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bula.</hi> But he was greedy of honour, and hot upon the publique ends, and too c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>On the other side, we have many of his Lenitie, and one of his Facility, when he did connive at the bold trespass of Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh,</hi> who before his arrivall at <hi>Fyall,</hi> had banded there against his precise Commandment; at which time he let fall a Noble word, being pressed by one, (whose name I need not remember) that at the least he would put him upon a Martial Court: That I would do (said he) if he were not my friend.</p>
                  <p>And now I am drawing towards the last Act, which was written in the Book of necessity.</p>
                  <p>At the Earls end I was abroad, but when I came

                     </gap> after Judges) yet, I spent some curiosity to search what it might be that could precipitate him into such a prodigious Catastrophe; and I must, according to my professed freedome, deliver a circumstance or two of some weight in the truth of that story, which was neither discovered at his arraignment, nor after in any of his private Confessions.</p>
                  <p>There was amongst his nearest attendants one <hi>Henry Cuffe,</hi> a man of secret ambitious ends of his own, and of proportionate Councels smothered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the habit of a Scholar, and slubbered over with a certain rude and clownish fashion, that had the semblance of integrity.</p>
                  <p>This person not above five or six weeks before my Lords fatall irruption in the City, was by the Earls special Command suddainly discharged from all further attendance, or access unto him, out of an inward displeasure then taken against his sharp and importune infusions, and out of a glimme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ing oversight, that he would prove the very instrument of his Ruine.</p>
                  <p>I must adde hereunto, that about the same time my Lord had received from the Countess of <hi>war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi> (a Lady powerful in the Court, and indeed a vertuous user of her power) the best advice that I think was ever given from either sex; That when he was free from restraint, he should closely take any out-lodging at <hi>Greenwic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi> and sometimes when the Queen went abroad in a good humour, (whereof she would give him notice) he should come forth, and humble himself before her in the field.</p>
                  <p>This Counsel sunk much into him, and for some
<pb n="659" facs="tcp:64446:273"/>
days he resolved it: but in the mean time, through the intercession of the Earl of <hi>Southampton,</hi> whom <hi>Cuffe</hi> had gained, he was restored to my Lords ear, and so working advantage upon his disgraces, and upon the vain foundation of Vulgar breath, which hurts many good men, spun out the final distructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his master and himself, and almost of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storer, if his pardon had not been won by inches.</p>
                  <p>True it is, that the Earl in <hi>Westminster-hall</hi> did in generall disclose the evill perswasions of this man; but the particulars which I have related by this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission and restitution, he buried in his own breast for some reasons apparent enough; Indeed (as I conjecture) not to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>xasperate the Case of my Lord of <hi>Southampton,</hi> though he might therewith a little peradventure have mollified his own. The whole and true Report I had by infallible meanes from the person himself that both brought the advice from the aforesaid excellent Lady, and carried the discharge to <hi>Cuffe,</hi> who in a private Chamber was strucken, therewith into a Sound almost dead to the Earth, as if he had fallen from some high steeple; such Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rets of hope he had built in his own fancy.</p>
                  <p>Touching the Dukes suddain period, how others have represented it unto their Fancies, I cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine: for my part, I must confess from my soul that I never recall it to minde without a deep and double astonishment of my discourse and reason.</p>

gained of the Queen, he went aside for a while, but at his return he came in with the greater strength, and so continued to her last, great in her favour, and Captain of the Guard. His prudence <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood</hi> his capacity, and his industry <hi>served</hi> it; raising his fortune as high as his parts, and his parts as high as his mind. His Motto was, <hi>Either dye</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, or <hi>live</hi> honorably.

               <p>Two things he observed in his Mistriss;
<list>
                     <item>1. That she was penurious in her largesses.</item>
                     <item>2. That she was choice in her Favourites.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Whence he concluded, that there was no good to be done unless he got an estate first, and then a reputation.</p>
               <p>To the first, we owe his Sea-voyages, when his whole fortune was often put up in one ship<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="673" facs="tcp:64446:280"/>
And to the last, his Land-services, when all his expectation depended on one action. Two Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals he observed, <hi>Essex</hi> for action, <hi>Cecil</hi> for counsel: The one he went under abroad, to outvy him; the other he complyed with at home, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine him: but wanting strength, though not parts to be both their Corrivals, he perished, because not thought to own humility enough to be their servants. <hi>Cecill</hi> indeed was his friend, because <hi>Essex</hi> was his enemy: but he taught him, <hi>That it was more safe at Court to have many enemies of equall power, than one false and ambitious friend, that hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to the absoluteness of command:</hi> But this he was often heard to say, he did not apprehend, before his Genius had dictated it to him, as he came in a Boat from the execution of the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> which was done at the Tower.—Yet two wayes I finde him getting up: 1. By uncouth projects in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment beyond expectation; which (though they might oblige his Mistriss) together with an opinion of his irreligion, lost him with the People. 2. By extraordinary undertakings in Warre beyond his Commission; which (though performed to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do his Generals) had forfeited his head to their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity and justice, had not his wit complyed with their easiness and goodness. It's a question a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Curiosoes,</hi> whether his often absence from Court was his <hi>prudence,</hi> or his <hi>weakness,</hi> it being a <hi>quodlibet,</hi> whether that distance was a greater al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay to his <hi>enemies malice,</hi> or his <hi>Sovereigns love</hi>; while his forreign actions were not so close at her ear to his advantage, as his Adversaries applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to his disparagemtnt.</p>
               <p>Two things I must needs say are wonderful in him. 1. The dispatch and industry of the former

               <p>Touching the first, he that shall consider his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious way of study, immers'd in almost infinite reading and observation, to which the running o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of innumerable books, and a vast multitude of men was necessary: His Obligations to read not onely common Authors, but all Records, Schemes, and Paper that he could come by: His correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

principal quality resided in Magnificence.

               <p>There was an ancient custom to celebrate the Anniversary of the King's Coronation with all the Shews of Magnificence and joy which the Art or
<pb n="726" facs="tcp:64446:287"/>
Affections of the People could invent; and because we are esteemed the Warlik'st Nation in the whole world, to continue that just regulation, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined all those effeminacies which are so predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in other Courts, and absolutely addicted our selves to such Martial exercises as are nothing less pleasing and delightful than the other, and yet fit and prepare men more for the real use of Arms, and acquisition of glory. Here our Knights praise came to my Lord of <hi>Carlisle</hi>'s notice, who first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed him a Commander; but finding his <hi>Genius</hi> more courtly than <hi>Martial,</hi> more learned than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive recommended him to his Majesties softer services, where none more obliging to the People by his industry and interest at Court, none more serviceable to his Majesty by the good name he gained in the Countrey: So careful was he of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick content, that from five to nine his Chamber was open to all <hi>Comers</hi>; where you would find him with the one hand making himself ready, with the other receiving Letters; and in all this hurry of Business, giving the most orderly, clear, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory dispatches of any Statesman at that time. From nine to one he attended his Master, to whom he had as easie access as he gave to his People. Two things set him up; 1. A fair respect from his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster upon all occasions, and as fair a treatment of the People: He had his distinct Classis of Affairs, and his distinct Officers for those Classis: The or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and method whereof incredibly advanced his dispatch, and eased his burden; which took up his day so, that there remained but some hours he stole from night and sleep, for his beloved and dear Studies; and King <hi>Iames</hi> said, he was the

If For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune had been as kind to him as Nature, greater Employments had been at once his honour and his business: But from all his services and performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, he derived no other advantage than the acting of them; and at his death he left no other wealth behind him, but that of a high reputation: never arriving at those enjoyments that enhance our Cares, not having time to withdraw himself from those cares that take away the relish of our enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>

For his person, he was not much beholding to Nature, though somewhat for his face, which was the best part of his outside: but for his inside, it may be said he was his Father's own son, and a pregnant Proficient in all discipline of State. He was a Courtier from his Cradle, yet at the age of twenty and upwards, he was much short of his after-proof; but exposed, and by change of climate he shewed what he was, and what he would be: He lived in those times, wherein the Queen had most need and use of men of weight; <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

Nature was a better friend to him than Fortune, and his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity than both; which commended him to a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress that understood Men as well as Books, and knew it was no less the interest of Princes to take counsel concerning Persons, than concerning mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: He had that goodness, without which man is a busie, mischievous, and wretched thing; yet that wisdom whereby he was not so good (as the <hi>Italian</hi> saith) as to be <hi>good for nothing</hi>: He was gentle, but not easie; mild, but not soft: obliging not the fancies of men, but their Interest: None more civil to Strangers (his heart being not a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Island (as my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> observes) but a large Continent:) None more tender of Inferiours, none more humble to Superiours; none more compassio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to the afflicted; none more loving to, or more beloved of all. The Queen said, she trusted her Kingdom to his faithfulness in 88. and her self to his conduct.

<pb n="737" facs="tcp:64446:292"/>
and a man of his Retinue must not be busie. He li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in an age when all honour was perillous that was not designed for service;
<hi rend="margQuotes">when the State chose Ministers that were more sensible of duty than of rising; that loved business rather upon consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence than upon bravery, and when the Prince discerned a busie nature from a willing mind: as the stone had need be rich that is set without foyl, so this noble person, that was only real, had need of great parts of vertue.</hi>

Two emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent services he did the Protestant Religion when but twenty one years of age: The first is, that he was so observant a witness of Arch-Bishop <hi>Parker</hi>'s consecration, that with his bare word the tale of the Nags head came to nothing. 2. That he was so close an Agent in the Court of <hi>France,</hi> that no Design was brewed in <hi>Scotland,</hi> none seconded in <hi>France,</hi> but he with the Emperour and the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Embassadors assistance [whom he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged with the hope of a Match between the King of the <hi>Romans</hi> and his Mistriss] discovered and defeated with that success, that the King of <hi>France</hi> courted his Mistriss to a Peace, and himself to Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. None more careful in matter of Business; none more splendid in business of Complement— condoling King <hi>Francis</hi> his death with a Majesty no less becoming the Personage he represented, than the Prince he addressed himself to. 1. His provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence

in contriving the <hi>English</hi> Ships nimble, and such as could tack about at pleasure. 2. His pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in not hazarding his weak Navy against the <hi>Spanish</hi> Army and Armado in an Engagement wherein a victory would be but a little glory, and a defeat a ruine. 3.

               </p>
               <p>This noble person was of greater experience than knowledg, and more beholding to his years than to his <hi>Education,</hi> whence K. <hi>Iames</hi> took great pleasure in his discourse, that was not morose, obstinate, narrow, unactive or formal, like a Students ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangues; but free, active, and ingenuous, like a States-man's Maximes — Whereof one was this; That never did Commander a noble Act that was Commission-bound; it being a question, whether the <hi>Venetians</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> lost more at Sea and in the Netherlands before they discovered that Error, or gained more since.

The Whale is steered at Sea by a far smaller Fish, and this States-man at Court by far meaner men than himself.<hi rend="margQuotes"> I my self (<hi>saith an ingenious man</hi>) have known many so far strangers to what was convenient, as they would scarce concede or deny any thing out of the presence of their Secretary: and this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded not seldom from a distrust there was no cause for; manifest in the Earl of <hi>Somerset,</hi> who though himself owner of a competent sufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, was so enchanted with an opinion of Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury</hi>'s parts, that he preferred him from a Servant to such an intimate friendship; as he could think nothing well educated for em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment in his Office, that had not passed his correction, nor secret laid up but in his bosome; which swelled him (saith he) to such a monstrosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in pride, that I have heard (not being my self then near the <hi>English</hi> Court) how he offered to rant at his servants, and did once beat his Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man for putting his commands under an inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our expostulation to his Master; and through this intollerable arrogance in him, and remisness in the Earl, the sparks first flew, that kindled the ruine of them both: Friendship being no more able to maintain its interest against a feminine affection, than so great a pride was to confine it self within the tedder of moderation.</hi>
The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est are not free, <hi>but led in triumph by the affections of others, through the mediation of their own.</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury</hi> would do what was most plausi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,

but this Favourite understood as well the humour of the People, as he did the disposition of his Prince, obliging the one no less, than he pleased the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

Familiar he was, yet not cheap; sociable upon regard, and not upon facility: His behaviour was his soul, free for any exercise or motion; finding many, and making more opportunities to endear himself: He broke his mind to small observations, yet he comprehended great matters: His carriage was so exact, as if affected; and yet so graceful; as if

That which overthrew the first, bewitched the wisest, and tyred the most patient man, undid this noble person: yet so regular were his affections, that he did nothing publickly in the Countess of <hi>Essex,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Suffolk</hi>'s Daughters case, but by due course of Law, the approbation of the gravest and wisest Divines and Counsellors, and the <note n="a" place="margin">

of Sequestration, the Commission only saying in the general, That the Arch-bishop could not at that present in his own Person attend those Services which were otherwise proper for his Cognizance and Jurisdiction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To say the truth, he was a man of good intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and knew much, but failed in what those or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily do that are devoted to our modern sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities, being extreamly obstinate in his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which the King was more willing to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand than follow, because most times he looked upon things according to the rigour of Ecclesiastick maximes, and was either too curious and irreso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute by variety of reading, or too peremptory and positive from the strictness of his Rules; or too zealous by reason of the seriousness of his Study; or wide from the matter, by reason of his <hi>inexperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> and aptness to require in the times he lived, the regularity of the times
<hi rend="margQuotes">he read <hi>of</hi> heeding not the force of Circumstances, the errors of Comparison, or the cautions of Application.</hi>
I like his Apology for his severity to the Clergy (that he was <hi>austere to prevent others being cruel</hi>) as well as his zeal for the Protestant Religion; onely his Principles betrayed his profession, which he rendered too obnoxious, while he supported it by those novel grounds which our Adversaries could make us confess were Heterodox, and by those streight-laced foundations which we saw our selves too narrow. As for instance, King <hi>Iames</hi> his vast capacity took him up once for making the Scripture the onely rule of Civil Affairs; owning the piety, but observing to his face the impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of that assertion. Imprudence, I say, as for
<pb n="749" facs="tcp:64446:298"/>
many reasons, so for this, because to assert a truth upon a weak principle, is to tempt the world to doubt of the strength of the first, when they see the weakness of the other. Whether he went off in discontent, and said, <hi>He would not attend at the Councel-Table, because he should not wait at the Altar</hi>: Whether he had such malignant followers as called themselves <hi>Nicodemites,</hi> or Night-Disciples: Whether he turned noon-day into mid-night; and mid-night into noon-day, having a candle always burning in his Chamber; or if so, for what reason, I would not have one of my years determine, but rather refer the present age to his Contemporaries pen, which describes him thus;</p>
               <p>A very learned man he was; his Erudition all of the old stamp, fitly principled in the Doctrine of S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> pious, grave, and exemplary in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation: But some think him a better man than Arch-Bishop, and that he was better qualified with merit for the Dignity, than with a spirit answering the Function; in the exercise whereof he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived too facile and yielding: his extraordinary remisness in not exacting strict Conformity to the prescribed Orders of the Church in point of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, seemed to resolve those legal Determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to their first Principle of Indifference, and led in such an habit of Inconformity, as the future re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of those tender-conscienced men to long discontinued obedience, was interpreted an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; as if he thought it might fall out in Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks as it doth sometimes in Physick, <hi>bina venena juvant,</hi> that the two contrary poysons of Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition and Innovation might prove a Cordial to the Church—</p>

               <p>SIr <hi>George Calvert</hi> was bred first in <hi>Trinity</hi>-Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and then beyond the Seas.

                  </note>Conceiving the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> highly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental in his preferment, he presented him with a Jewel of great value; which the Duke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned him again, not owning any Activity in his Advancement, whom King <hi>Iames, ex mero motu,</hi> reflecting on his Abilities, designed for the Place. This Place he discharged five years, until he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly resigned the same, 1624. on this occasion; He freely confessed himself to the King, that he was then become a <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> so that he must either be wanting to his Trust, or violate his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science in discharging his Office. This his Ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty so highly affected King <hi>Iames,</hi> that he continued him Privy-Councellor all his Reign, and soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter created him Lord <hi>Baltemore</hi> of <hi>Baltemore</hi> in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>During his being Secretary, he had a Patent to him and his Heirs to be <hi>Absolutus Dominus &amp; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietarius,</hi> with the Royalties of a Count Palatine of the Province of <hi>Avalon</hi> in the New-found land,
<pb n="751" facs="tcp:64446:299"/>
a place so named by him in imitation of old <hi>Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> in <hi>Somersetshire,</hi> wherein <hi>Glassenbury</hi> stands, the first-fruits of Christianity in <hi>Britain,</hi> as the other was in that part of <hi>America.</hi> Here he built a fair house in <hi>Ferry-land,</hi> and spent twenty five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand pounds in advancing the Plantation thereof.</p>
               <p>Indeed his publick spirit consulted not his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate profit, but the enlargement of Christianity, and the Kings Dominions, in that his ancient, primitive, and heroick work of planting the world. After the death of King <hi>Iames</hi> he went twice in person to New-found land. Here when Mounsieur <hi>de l' Arade</hi> with three men of War sent from the King of <hi>France,</hi> had reduced our <hi>English</hi> Fishermen to great extreamity; this Lord with two Ships man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at his own charge, chased away the <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> relieved the <hi>English,</hi> and took sixty of the <hi>French</hi> Prisoners.

               <p>Judg <hi>Popham</hi> and Sir <hi>George Calvert</hi> agreed not more unanimously in the publick design of Plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than they differed in the private way of it: the first was for extirpating Heathens, the second for converting them.—He sent away the lewdest, <hi>this</hi> the soberest people: the one was for present profit,
<pb n="752" facs="tcp:64446:300"/>
the other for a reasonable expectation (it being in the case of planting Countreys, as in that of plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Woods; you must account to lose almost twenty years profit, and expect your recompence in the end; it being necessary the Province should first find her self, and then enrich you.) The Judge was for many Governors, the Secretary for few, and those not concerned Merchants, but uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned Gentlemen: The one granted Liberties without any restraint, the other with great caution: The first set up a common Stock, out of which the Island should be provided for by proportions; the second left every one to provide for himself.</p>
               <p>Two things are eminent in this man:

                     <item>1.

                     <item>2. That he carried a digested and exact account of Affairs to his Master every night, and took to himself the pains to examine the Letters which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to any Interest that might be any ways consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable. He was the onely States-man, that being engaged to a decryed party, yet managed his busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness with that huge respect for all sides, that all who knew him, applauded him; and none that had any thing to do with him, complained of him.</item>

               <p>They that exclaimed against his unserviceable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, never observed <hi>this passage</hi>: A company of young Courtiers appeared extraordinary gallant at a Tilting, far above their Fortunes and Estates, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving for their Motto, <hi>Solvat Ecclesia.</hi> Bishop <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croft</hi> then of <hi>London</hi> hearing of it, finds on enquiry that the Queen was passing a considerable parcel of Church-lands to them, and stops the business with his own and his friends Interest, leaving these Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants to pay the shot of their pride and prodigality out of their own purses. —And <hi>this</hi>; that a prevalent Courtier had swallowed up the whole Bishoprick of <hi>Durham,</hi> had not this Arch-Bishop seasonably interposed his power with King <hi>Iames</hi> (ready e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to admit such Intercessions) and dashed the design.

               <head>Observations on the Life of Sir <hi>Tho. Overbury.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>SIr <hi>Thomas Overbury,</hi> son to Sir <hi>Nicholas O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbury,</hi> one of the Judges of the Marches, was born at <hi>Burton</hi> on the Hill in <hi>Gloucester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi> bred in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and attained to be a most accomplished Gentleman, partly at <hi>Grayes-Inn,</hi> and partly in <hi>France</hi>; which the happiness of his Pen both in Poetry and Prose doth declare. In the later he is observed to be the first writer of Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of our Nation.
But if the great parts of this Gentleman were guilty of Insolence and Petulancy, <hi rend="margQuotes">which some since have charged on his memory; reporting of him, that he should say, <hi>Somerset</hi> ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his advancement to him, and that he should walk with his hat on before the queen; we may charitably presume, that his reduced age would have corrected such Juvenile extravagancies. It is questionable, whether <hi>Robert Carr</hi> Earl of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merset</hi> were more in the favour of King <hi>Iames,</hi> or this Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury</hi> in the favour of the Earl of <hi>Somerset,</hi> until he lost it by disswading that Lord from keeping company with a Lady (the Wife of another person of honour) as neither for his credit here, or comfort hereafter. Soon after Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> was by King <hi>Iames</hi> designed Embassador for <hi>Russia.</hi> His false friends perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him to decline the Employment, as no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than an honourable Grave.

Prison; A ship by Sea, and a barbarous cold Countrey by Land. Besides, they possessed him, that within a small time, the King should be wrought to a good opinion of him. But he that willingly goes into a Prison, out of hope to come easily out of it, may stay therein so long, till he be too late convinced of another Judgement. Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> was in the Tower, his Refusal was presented to the K. as an Act of high Contempt, as if he valued himself more than the Kings ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. His strict restraint gave the greater liberty to his enemies to practice his death, 1615. which was by poyson performed: Yet was his blood le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally revenged, which cost some a violent, and others a civil death, as deprived of their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The Earl was soon abated in King <hi>Iames</hi> his affection (Oh! the short distance betwixt the cooling and quenching of a Favourite) being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, and banished the Court.</hi>

               <p>This is certain, he was a man fit for government, who quickly apprehended where any evil was, and had capacity enough to apply the remedy; onely he had a little too stiffe a nature that would not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily yield, when he found on which side there was most reason; and too much of the City in his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximes, which pretended to attain to that in a short time, which Politicians think not proper to arrive at but by a leasurely fuccession of Ages and Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

After this for a long time, I supplied the Office of University-Oratour, and bestowed my time in the study of sundry faculties, without any inclination to profess any one above the rest; insomuch as at last I waxed desirous to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel beyond the Seas, for attaining to the knowledge of some special modern Tongues, and for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of my experience in the managing of affairs; being wholly then addicted to employ my self and all my cares in the publick service of the State.</p>

After my return, in the year 1585, I was employed by the Queen to the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and to the <hi>German</hi> Princes: Next, to <hi>Henry</hi> the third, King of <hi>France</hi>: After this, in 88, for the better conduct of her Highness Affairs in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces United, I was thought a fit person to reside in those parts, and was sent thereupon to the <hi>Hague</hi> in <hi>Holland</hi>; where, according to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract that had formerly pass'd between her High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and the States, I was admitted for one of their Council of Estate, taking place in their As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies next to Count <hi>Maurice,</hi> and yielding my suffrage in all that was proposed. During all that time, what approbation was given of my painful endeavours by the Queen, by the Lords in <hi>England,</hi> by the States of the Countrey there, and by all the <hi>English</hi> Soldiery, I refer it to be notified by some others Relation.</p>
               <p n="6">6. I received from her Majesty many comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Letters of her gracious acceptance of my dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and care: and among the Lords of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil had no man more to friend, then was the Lord Treasurer <hi>Burleigh.</hi> For when occasion had been offered of declaring his conceit as touching my ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, he would always tell the Queen (which I received from her self and some other Ear-witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses) that there was not any man in <hi>England</hi> so meet as my self to undergo the Office of the Secretary. And sithence his son, the present Lord Treasurer hath signified unto me in private conference, that when his Father first intended to advance him to that place, his purpose was withal to make me his Colleague: But that the daily provocations of the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> were so bitter and sharp against him,
<pb n="808" facs="tcp:64446:328"/>
and his comparisons so odious when he put us in a balance, as he thought thereupon he had very great reason to use his best means, to put any man out of hope of raising his fortune, whom the Earl with such violence, to his extream prejudice, had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to dignifie.</p>

When I had well considered, how ill it did concur with my natural disposition, to become or to be counted either a stickler or partaker in any publick faction; how well I was able, by Gods good blessing, to live of my self, if I could be contented with a competent livelihood; I resolved thereupon to possess my soul in peace all the residue of my days, to take my farewel of State-employments, and so to retire me from the Court.</p>

               <p>SIr <hi>Fran.</hi> was of a fiery spirit &amp; rigid nature, undaunted in all danger, not overvaluing the price of mens lives to purchase a victory therewith. He served on the Scene of all <hi>Christendom</hi> where War was acted. One Master<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece of his valour was at the Battel of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,</hi> when his ragged Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment (so were the <hi>English-men</hi> called, from their ragged Cloathes) helped to make all whole, or else all had been lost.</p>
               <p>Another was, when for three years he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended <hi>Ostend</hi> against a strong and numerous Army, surrendring it at last a bare Skeleton to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who paid more years purchase for it, than probably the World would endure. He dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the beginning of the Reign of K. <hi>Iames,</hi> about the year of our Lord, 16—</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="814" facs="tcp:64446:331"/>SIr <hi>Horace</hi> had more meekness, &amp; as much valour as his brother; so pious that he first made peace with God, before he went to war with man One of an excellent tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; it being true of him what is said of the <hi>Caspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Sea, that it doth never ebb nor flow; observing a constant tenor, neither elated nor depressed with sucess. Had one seen him returning from a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, he would by his si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence have suspected that he had lost the day; and had he beheld him in a retreat, he would have collected him a Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, by the cheerfulness of his spirit. He was the first Baron of K. <hi>Charles</hi> his Creation. Some years after, coming to Court, he fell suddenly sick and speechless, so that he died afore night, <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 163... No doubt he was well prepared for death, seeing such his vigilan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that never any enemy surprised him in his Quarters.</p>
               <p>Now to compare them together (such their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minency, that they would hardly be parallel'd by any but themselves:) Sir <hi>Francis</hi> was the elder Brother, Sir <hi>Horace</hi> lived to be the elder man. Sir <hi>Francis</hi> was more feared, Sir <hi>Horace</hi> more lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Soldiery: The former in Martial Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline was oftentimes <hi>Rigidus ad ruinam,</hi> the latter

seldome exceeded <hi>ad terrorem.</hi> Sir <hi>Francis</hi> left none, Sir <hi>Horace</hi> no Male-Issue, whose four Co-Heirs are since Matched into honourable Families. Both lived in War, much honoured; dyed in peace, much lamented.</p>
               <p>What is a great question among all Martial men, was so between these Brethren; whether to repair a reputation ruined by some infamous disgrace,
<hi rend="margQuotes">and the honour abused by some notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous loss, the General ought to oppose the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune that oppresseth him,</hi> and hazard what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, to recover what is lost?
Sir <hi>Francis</hi> was of opinion, <hi>That though it's not the interest of a supream Prince, yet it is the concern of a subordinate Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander to support his credit at the rate of his Army.</hi> But Sir <hi>Horace</hi> was never for sacrificing the whole for the advancing of any part, or of many for the humouring of one; but chose rather to break the impetuosity of his misfortunes by yielding to them, and rather recover both himself and his success by a prudent retreat, than lose both in an obstinate misadventure.—It being far more eligible to suffer in the imaginary interest of repute<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="816" facs="tcp:64446:332"/>
Downs, Sir <hi>Francis Vere</hi> well knowing how much it imported the business of the day to hold a place of such advantage, perswaded Count <hi>Maurice</hi> rather to expect the Enemy in that ground, than attaque him in a worse; wherein as his opinion prevailed, so all that were present, were Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witnesses both of the truth of his conjecture, and the soundness of his judgement: For the Enemy, as he said, did not long gaze upon them; but charging up the hills, were beaten back so effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, that our men had the excution of them for half a mile; which was no small advantage to the fortune of that day.</p>
               <p>Neither were they less observant of their time, that Mother of Action, than their place; neither hasty nor slow to manage an opportunity that is neither often or long the same; — or of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of their Army than both, whereof each part assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted the other at <hi>Newport,</hi> and elsewhere so read<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Reliefs of <hi>Rhingbergh</hi> were actions of great resolution, ready dispatch, a watchful circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection, and good pursuit: The succour of <hi>Lithen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooven</hi> was a performance of great and mature de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation; the surprize of <hi>Zutphen</hi> by young Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers in womens apparel, was a piece of service of many particular stratagems; and the Siege of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venter</hi> of as much sage advice.—All instances of the wonders that courage can do when wise, valour when sober, a passion when rational, and a great spirit when advised.</p>

The first occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of his Rice, was his stating of the Cooks Case of the Temple so exactly, that all the House who were puzzled with it, admired him; and his pleading it so, that the whole Bench took notice of him.

In his fair fortune with his Wife, in his happy stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Laws, and in his free coming by all his Offices, <hi>nec prece, nec pretio,</hi> neither begging nor bribing for Preferment.</p>
               <p>His parts were admirable: he had a deep Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, faithful Memory, active Fancy, and the Jewel of his mind was put into a fair Case, a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful body with a comely countenance: A case, which he did wipe and keep clean, delighting in good Cloaths, well worn, and being wont to say, <hi>That the outward neatness of our bodies, might be a Monitor of purity to our souls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In his Pleadings, Discourse, and Judgements, he declined all Circumlocutions, usually saying, <hi>The matter lyes in a little Room</hi>

in his Rings when made Sergeant, <hi>Lex est tutissima Classis,</hi> The Law is the safest Helmet. And now he had leisure to peruse what formerly he had written, even thirty Books with his own hand, most pleasing himself with a Manual, which he called <hi>VADE MECUM,</hi> from whence at one view he took a prospect of his Life past, having noted therein most Remarkables. His most learned and laborious Works on the Laws will last to be admired by the Judicious Posterity, whilest Fame hath a Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet left her, and any breath to blow therein. His judgement lately passed for an Oracle in Law; and since the credit thereof hath causelesly been questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, the wonder is not great. If the Prophet himself, living in an incredulous Age, found cause to complain, <hi>Who hath believed our report?</hi> it need not seem strange that our licentious Times have afforded some to shake the Authenticalness of the Reports of any earthly Judge.</p>
               <p>He constantly had Prayers said in his own house, and charitably relieved the Poor with his constant Almes. The Foundation of <hi>Sutton</hi>'s Hospital (when indeed but a Foundation) had been ruined before it was raised, and crush'd by some Courtiers in the hatching thereof, had not his great care preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the same.

                     <item>7. That his Tenants in <hi>Norfolk</hi> were hardly used; and that though he had ten thousand pounds <hi>per an.</hi> he relieved not the poor.</item>

                     <item>9. That he stood out against Power; for which, and other failures, he was dismissed the Council-board with this expression from King <hi>Iames, That he was the fittest instrument to serve a Tyrant.</hi>

               <p>SIr <hi>Francis</hi> was born where we are made men, bred where we are made States-men; being equally happy in the quickness of the City, and politeness of the Court: He had a large mind from his Father, and great abilities from his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; his parts improved more than his years: his great, fixed, and methodical memory, his solid judgement, his quick fancy, his ready expression, gave high assurance of that profound and universal knowledge and comprehension of things which then rendered him the observation of great and wise men, and afterwards the wonder of all. The

The Queen called him her young <hi>Lord Keeper,</hi> for his grave ingenuity at seven years of age; and he could tell her <hi>Majesty he was two years</hi>

in his time the Master of speech and action, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all before him.</p>
               <p>The Earl of <hi>Salisbury</hi> saith, Sir <hi>Walter Raw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh,</hi> was a good Orator, but a bad Writer; the Earl of <hi>Northampton</hi> was a good Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but a bad Orator; Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> excelled in <hi>both:</hi> Much he said he owed to his Books, more to his innate Principles and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: When <hi>he thought,</hi> he said, he aimed more at Connexion than Variety: When he spake, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed rather the life and vigour of expression, and perspicuity of words, (asking often if the meaning were expressed plainly enough) than the elegancy or order of phrase.

               <p>My Lord of <hi>Salisbury</hi> said, he had the clearest prospect of things of any man in his age; and King <hi>Iames,</hi> by whom he was never reproved in eighteen years, said, <hi>That he knew the method of handling Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, after a mild and gentle manner</hi>: Not ingaging his Master in any rash or grievous courses, insult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over no offender, but carrying it decently and compassionately to the person of the offender, when most severe against the offence.

When impure <hi>Scioppius</hi> upon his Libel against K. <hi>Iames,</hi> and Sir <hi>Humphrey Bennet</hi>'s complaint to the Arch-Duke against him, fled to <hi>Madrid</hi>; my Lord observing that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to have Justice done against him from the Catholique King because of the Jesuites, puts his Cousin <hi>George Digby</hi> upon cutting him; which he did over his Nose and Mouth wherewith he offended, so that he carried the mark of his Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy to his Grave. 3. When he was extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Embassador in <hi>Germany,</hi> upon his return
<pb n="840" facs="tcp:64446:344"/>
by <hi>Heidelbergh,</hi> observing that Count <hi>Mansfield</hi>'s Army, upon whom depended the fortune of the <hi>Palsgrave,</hi> was like to disband for want of money, he pawned all his Plate and Jewels to buoy up that sinking Cause for that time. That his spirit was thus great abroad, was his honour; but that it was too great at home, was his unhappiness: for he enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in a fatal Contrast with the Duke of <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> that hazarded both their safeties, had not this Lord feared the Duke's power (as the Duke this Lord's policy) and so at last it became a drawn Battel betwixt them; yet so, that this Earl lost the love of King <hi>Charles,</hi> living many years in his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favour: But such as are in a Court-cloud, have commonly the Countreys Sun-shine; and this Peer during his Eclipse, was very popular with most of the Nation. It is seldom seen, if a Favourite once broken at Court, sets up again for himself; the hap (rather than happiness) of this Lord, the King graciously reflecting on him at the beginning of the Long <hi>Parliament,</hi> as one best able to give him the safest Councel in those dangerous times. But how he incensed the <hi>Parliament</hi> so far, as to be excepted pardon, I neither do know, nor dare enquire. Sure I am, that after the surrender of <hi>Exeter,</hi> he went over into <hi>France,</hi> where he met with that due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect in Foreign, which he missed in his Native Countrey. The worst I wish such, who causelesly suspect him of Popish inclinations (saith my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor) is, that I may hear from them but half so many strong Arguments for the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> as I heard from him, who was to his commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a cordial Champion for the Church of <hi>England.</hi> This Family hath been much talked of this last for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

years; though all that I can say of it is this, that great spirits, large parts, high honours, penned with narrow Estates, seldom bless their owners within <hi>moderation,</hi> or the places they live in with <hi>peace.</hi>

<pb n="844" facs="tcp:64446:346"/>
for within some while, the King had taken by certain glances (whereof the first was at <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorpe</hi> in a Progress) such liking of his Person, that he was resolved to make him a Master<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece, and to mould him as it were Platonically to his own Idea. Neither was his Majesty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent onely to be the Architect of his Fortune, without putting his gracious hand likewise to some part of the work it self; insomuch that it pleased him to descend, and to avale his goodness, even to the giving of his foresaid friend Sir <hi>Iohn Greham</hi> secret directions, how, by what degrees he should bring him into favour.</hi>
His own parts and observation gained him prudence and discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; His Family and Ancestors in <hi>Leicester-shire,</hi> gentility and repute; so that there wanted nothing but Interest to set him up a Courtier: Sir <hi>Thomas Compton,</hi> who had married his Mother, supplyed him with the one, and the Earls of <hi>Bedford, Pembrook,</hi> and <hi>Hertford,</hi> who would eclipse <hi>Somerset,</hi> helped him to the other: For those three Lords meeting one night at <hi>Baynards-Castle,</hi> and commanding <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merset</hi>'s picture should be abused in their way: next day Sir <hi>Thomas Lake</hi> leads him into Court, buying him the Cup-bearers place: A while after the Countess of <hi>Bedford</hi> ushereth him to the Presence-Chamber, entering him a Bed-chamber-man,—and the Earl of <hi>Pembrook</hi> supports him, until he was a Favourite. The Courtiers wished him well, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was an <hi>English-man</hi>: the Nobility favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, because a Gentleman; the Ladies have a kindness for him, because the exactest Courtier in <hi>Christendom</hi>; the King observes him much, for his compleat body, more for his pregnant parts; and
<pb n="845" facs="tcp:64446:346"/>
the States-men now consulting <hi>Somerset's</hi> removal, and finding King <hi>Iames</hi> his good nature loth to leave the bosom of one <hi>Minion,</hi> until he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed himself in another, made it their plot to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance him. His carriage was free and debonair; his passions even and smooth, and one saith, carried in his pocket; his nature noble and open; his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per industrious and inquisitive; his intellectuals clear and capable; his mind tractable and docible; his spirit resolute and undaunted. — The first month he comes to Court, he takes place above all his fellows; and being removed with some affront by a creature of <hi>Somerset</hi>'s, gives him a box on the ear; an action that gave him and his friends a sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable occasion of a Contest with <hi>Somerset,</hi> and him a clear conquest over him: <hi>Somerset</hi> as Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain would have cut off his hand, and he as Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite was like to have cut off his head. This new Favourite riseth; all are weary of <hi>Somerset</hi> the first <hi>Minion,</hi> all welcom the second. The King is first his Tutor, and then his Patron, instructing him before he employed him. Three sorts of studies he engaged him in; the first was for delights in private Retyrements; the second for ornament in Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course; the third, for ability in Business. He had Princely apprehensions of the principles and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximes of Government, a distinct notion of all his Affairs, an excellent way to make use of other mens Abilities; and these incomparable Rules from my Lord <hi>Bacon,</hi> which were transcribed in his Life.</p>
               <p>Sir, In the first place,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Compleat instructions for a states-man, given by L.</hi> B. <hi>to D.</hi> B.</note> I shall be bold to put you in mind of the present condition you are in; You are not onely a Courtier, but a Bed-chamber-man,
<pb n="846" facs="tcp:64446:347"/>
and so are in the eye and ear of your Master; but you are also a Favourite; The Favourite of the time, and so are in his bosom also; The world hath so voted you, and doth so esteem of you, (for Kings and great Princes, even the wisest of them, have had their Friends, their Favourites, their Privadoes, in all ages; for they have their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections as well as other men) of these they make several uses: sometimes to communicate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate their thoughts with them, and to ripen their judgments thereby; sometimes to ease their cares by imparting them; and sometimes to interpose them between themselves and the envy or malice of their People (for Kings cannot erre, that must be discharged upon the shoulders of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters; and they who are nearest unto them must be content to bear the greatest load.) Truly Sir, I do not believe or suspect that you are chosen to this eminency, out of the last of these considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; for you serve such a Master, who by his wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and goodness, is as free from the malice or envy of his Subjects, as, I think I may say truly, ever any King was, who hath sate upon his Throne before him: But I am confident, his Majesty hath cast his eyes upon you, as finding you to be such as you should be, or hoping to make you to be such as he would have you to be; for this I may say with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out flattery, your outside promiseth as much as can be expected from a Gentleman. But be it in the one respect, or other, it belongeth to you to take care of your self, and to know well what the name of a Favourite signifies: If you be chosen upon the former respects, you have reason to take care of your actions and deportment, out of your grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
<pb n="847" facs="tcp:64446:347"/>
for the King's sake; but if out of the later, you ought to take the greater care, for your own sake.</p>
               <p>You are as a new risen Star, and the eyes of all men are upon you; let not your own negligence make you fall like a Meteor.</p>
               <p>The contemplation then of your present condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion must necessarily prepare you for action; what time can be well spar'd from your attendance on your Master, will be taken up by suitors, whom you cannot avoid, nor decline, without reproach; for if you do not already, you will soon find the throng of suitors attend you; for no man, almost, who hath to do with the King, will think himself safe, unless you be his good Angel, and guide him, or, or least, that you be not a <hi>Malus Genius</hi> against him; so that, in respect of the King your Master, you must be very wary, that you give him true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation; and if the matter concern him in his Government, that you do not flatter him; if you do, you are as great a Traytor to him in the Court of Heaven, as he that draws his sword against him: and in respect of the Suitors which shall attend you, there is nothing will bring you more honour and more ease, then to do them what right in justice you may, and with as much speed as you may; for believe it, Sir, next to the obtaining of the suit, a speedy and a gentle denyal (when the case will not bear it) is the most acceptable to suitors; they will gain by their dispatch, whereas else they shall spend their time and money in attending; and you will gain in the ease you will find in being rid of their importunity. But if they obtain what they reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably desired, they will be doubly bound to you
<pb n="848" facs="tcp:64446:348"/>
for your favour: <hi>Bis dat qui cito dat</hi>; it multiplies the courtesie, to do it with good words, and spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily.</p>
               <p>That you may be able to do this with the best advantage, my humble advice is this; when sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors come unto you, set apart a certain hour in a day to give them audience: If the business be light and easie, it may by word only be delivered, and in a word be answered; but if it be either of weight, or of difficulty, direct the suitor to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it to writing, (if it be not so already) and then direct him to attend for his answer at a set time to be appointed, which would constantly be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, unless some matter of great moment do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt it: when you have received the Petitions (and it will please the Petitioners well, to have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess unto you to deliver them into your own hand) let your Secretary first read them, and draw lines under the material parts thereof (for the matter, for the most part, lies in a narrow room.) The Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions being thus prepared, do you constantly set apart an hour in a day to peruse those Petit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ons; and after you have ranked them into several files, according to the subject matter, make choice of two or three friends, whose judgments and fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties you believe you may trust in a business of that nature, and recommend it to one or more of them, to inform you of their opinions, and of their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons for, or against the granting of it; and if the matter be of great weight indeed, then it would not be amiss to send several Copies of the same Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition to several of your friends, the one not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what the other doth, and desire them to return their answers to you by a certain time, to be prefix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed
<pb n="849" facs="tcp:64446:348"/>
in writing; so shall you receive an impartial answer, and by comparing the one with the other, you shall both discern the abilities and faithfulness of your friends, and be able to give a judgement thereupon, as an Oracle. But by no means trust not to your own judgement alone, for no man is omniscient; nor trust onely to your servants, who may mislead you, or mis-inform you; by which they may perhaps gain a few crowns, but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach will lye upon your self, if it be not rightly carried.</p>
               <p>For the facilitating of your dispatches, my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice is further, that you divide all the Petitions, and the matters therein contained, under several heads; which, I conceive, may be fitly ranked into these eight sorts.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Matters that concern Religion, and the Church and Church-men.</item>
                  <item>2. Matters concerning Justice, and the Laws, and the Professors thereof.</item>
                  <item>3. Councellors, and the Council-Table, and the great Offices and Officers of the Kingdom.</item>
                  <item>4. Foreign Negotiations and Embassies.</item>
                  <item>5. Peace and War, both foreign and civil, and in that the Navy and Forts, and what belongs to them.</item>
                  <item>6. Trade at home and abroad.</item>
                  <item>7. Colonies, or foreign Plantations.</item>
                  <item>8. The Court, and Curiality.</item>
               </list>
               <p>And whatsoever will not fall naturally under one of these heads, believe me, Sir, will not be worthy of your thoughts, in this capacity we now speak of. And of these sorts, I warrant you, you will find e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to keep you in b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="850" facs="tcp:64446:349"/>I begin with the first, which concerns Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the first place, be you your self rightly perswaded and setled in the true Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, professed by the Church of <hi>England</hi>; which doubtless is as sound and orthodox in the doctrine thereof, as any Christian Church in the world.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In this you need not be a Monitor to your gracious Master the King; the chiefest of his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Titles, is, to be <hi>The Defender of the Faith</hi>; and his learning is eminent, not only above other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but above other men; be but his scholar, and you are safe in that.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For the Discipline of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> by Bishops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I will not positively say, as some do, that it's <hi>Iure Divino</hi>; but this I say, and think, <hi>ex animo,</hi> that it is the nearest to Apostolical truth; and confidently I shall say, it is fittest for Monarchy of all others: I will use no other authority to you, than that excellent Proclamation set out by the King himself in the first year of his Reign, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed before the Book of Common Prayer; which I desire you to read; and if at any time there shall be the least motion made for Innovation, to put the King in mind to read it himself: It is most dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in a State to give ear to the least alterations <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="6">6. For Deans, and Canons or Prebends of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral Churches: In their first institution they were of great use in the Church; they were not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be of Council with the Bishop for his reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, but chiefly for his Government in causes Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical; use your best means to prefer such to those places who are fit for that purpose, men emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent for their learning, piety, and discretion, and put the King often in mind thereof; and let them be reduced again to their first institution.</p>
               <p n="7">7. You will be often sollicited, and perhaps im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuned to prefer Scholars to Church-Livings; you may further your friends in that way, <hi>caeteris paribus</hi>; otherwise, remember, I pray, that these are not places meerly of favour, the charge of souls lies upon them; the greatest account whereof will be required at their own hands; but they will share deeply in their faults who are the instruments of their preferment.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Besides the <hi>Romish Catholicks,</hi> there is a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Sectaries, the <hi>Anabaptists, Brownists,</hi> and others, of their kinds; they have been several times very busie in this Kingdom, under the colour of zeal for reformation of Religion: The King your Mr. knows their disposition very well; a small touch will put him in mind of them; he had experience of them in <hi>Scotland,</hi> I hope he will beware of them in <hi>England</hi>; a little countenance or connivance sets them on fire.</p>

Order and decent ceremonies in the Church, are not only comely but commendable; but there must be great care, not to introduce Innovations, they will quickly prove scandalous: men are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally over-prone to suspition; the true Protestant Religion is seated in the golden mean; the enemies unto her, are the extreams on either hand.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The persons of Church-men are to be had in due respect, for their words sake, and protected from scorn: but if a Clergy-man be loose and scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous, he must not be patroniz'd nor wink't at; the example of a few such, corrupt many.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Great care must be taken, that the patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Church be not sacrilegiously diverted to lay-uses: His Majesty in his time hath religiously stopped a leak that did much harm, and would else have done more. Be sure, as much as in you lyes, stop the like upon all occasions.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Colledges and Schools of Learning are to be cherished and encouraged, there to breed up a new stock to furnish the Church and Common-wealth, when the old store are transplanted. This Kingdom hath in later ages be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But I utterly condemn the practice of the latter times, which hath lately crept into the Court (at the back-stairs) That some who are prick'd for Sheriffs, and were fit, should get out of the Bill; and others who were neither thought upon, nor worthy to be, should be nominated, and both for money.</p>
               <p n="22">22. I must not omit to put you in mind of the Lords Lieutenants, and Deputy-Lieutenants of the Counties: their proper use is for ordering the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary affairs, in order to an invasion from abroad, or a rebellion or sedition at home; good choice should be made of them, and prudent instructions given to them, and as little of the Arbitrary power as may be left unto them; and that the Muster-Masters, and their Officers under them, incroach not upon the Subject; that will detract much from the King's service.</p>

               <p n="25">25. A word more, if you please to give me leave, for the true rules of the moderation of Justice on the King's part. The execution of justice is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his Judges, which seemeth to be the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer part: but the milder part, which is mercy, is wholly left in the King's immediate hand: And Justice and Mercy are the true supporters of his Royal Throne.</p>
               <p n="26">26. If the King shall be wholly intent upon Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, it may appear with an over-rigid aspect; but if he shall be over-remiss and easie, it draweth upon him contempt. Examples of Justice must be made sometimes for terrour to some; Examples of Mercy, sometimes, for comfort to others: the one procures fear, and the other love. A King must be both feared and loved, else he is lost.</p>
               <p n="27">27. The ordinary Courts of Justice I have spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, and of their Judges and judicature; I shall put you in mind of some things touching the High Court of Parliament in <hi>England,</hi> which is superla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; and therefore it will behove me to speak the more warily thereof.</p>

For the institution of it, it is very antient in this Kingdom: It consisteth of the two Houses, of Peers and Commons, as the Members; and of the King's Majesty, as the head of that great body: By the King's authority alone, and by his Writs, they are assembled, and by him alone they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="30">30. No new Laws can be made, nor old Laws abrogated or altered, but by common consent in Parliament, where Bills are prepared and present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the two Houses, and then delivered: but nothing is concluded but by the King's Royal as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent; They are but Embroys, 'tis he giveth life un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them.</p>
               <p n="31">31. Yet the House of Peers hath a power of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature in some cases; properly, to examine, and then to affirm, or if there be cause, to reverse the judgments which have been given in the Court of King's Bench, (which is the Court of highest ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction in the Kingdom, for ordinary Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) but in these cases it must be done by Writ of Error <hi>in Parliamento</hi>: And thus the rule of their proceedings is not <hi>absoluta potestas,</hi> as in making new Laws (in that conjuncture as before) but <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitata potestas,</hi> according to the known Laws of the Land.</p>

               <p n="33">33. The true use of Parliaments in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is very excellent; and they would be often called, as the affairs of the Kingdom shall require; and continued so long as is necessary, and no longer,

for then they be but burthens to the people, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the priviledges justly due to the Members of the two Houses and their Attendants; which their just rights and priviledges are religiously to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served and maintained; but if they should be unju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stly enlarged beyond their true bounds, they might lessen the just power of the Crown, it borders so near upon popularity.</p>
               <p n="34">34. All this while I have spoken concerning the Common Laws of <hi>England,</hi> generally, and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly so called, because it is most general and common to almost all cases and causes, both civil and crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal: But there is also another Law, which is called the Civil or Ecclesiastical Law, which is confined to some few heads; and that is not to be neglected: and although I am a professor of the Common-Law, yet am I so much a lover of Truth and of Learning, and of my native Countrey, that I do heartily perswade that the Professors of that Law, called Civilians (because the Civil Law is their guide) should not be discountenanced nor discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged; else whensoever we shall have ought to do with any foreign King or State, we shall be at a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable loss, for want of Learned men in that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.</p>
               <p n="3">III. I come now to the consideration of those things which concern Councellors of State, The Council-Table, and the great Offices and Officers of the Kingdom, which are those who for the most part furnish out that honourable Board.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of Councellors, there are two sorts: The first, <hi>Consiliarii nati,</hi> (as I may term them) such are the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> and others of the King's Sons (when he hath more<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>) of these I speak not,
<pb n="862" facs="tcp:64446:356"/>
for they are naturally born to be Councellors to the KING, to learn the art of Governing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But the ordinary sort of Councellors are such as the King, out of a due consideration of their worth and abilities, and withal, of their fidelities to his Person and to his Crown, calleth to be of Councel with him in his ordinary Government. And the Council-Table is so called, from the place where they ordinarily assemble and sit together; and their Oath is the onely ceremony used, to make them such, which is solemnly given unto them, at their first admission: These honourable persons are from thenceforth of that Board and Body: They cannot come until they be thus called, and the King at his pleasure may spare their attendance; and he may dispense with their presence there, which at their own pleasure they may not do.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This being the quality of their service, you will easily judge what care the King should use, in his choice of them; It behoveth that they be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of great trust and fidelity, and also of wisdom and judgment, who shall thus assist in bearing up the King's Throne; and of known experience in publick affairs.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Yet it may not be unfit to call some of young years, to train them up in that Trade, and so fit them for those weighty affairs, against the time of greater maturity; and some also for the honour of their persons: But these two sorts not to be tyed to so strict attendance, as the others from whom the present dispatch of business is expected.</p>

would be the more venerable. And I know that Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> in whose time I had the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to be born, and to live many years, was not so much observed, for having a numero<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s, as a wise Councel.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The duty of a Privy-Councellor to a King, I conceive, is, not onely to attend the Councel-board, at the times appointed, and there to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult of what shall be propounded; But also to study those things which may advance the King's honour and safety, and the good of the Kingdom, and to communicate the same to the King, or to his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Councellors, as there shall be occasion. And this, Sir, will concern you more then others, by how much you have a larger share in his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And one thing I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hall be bold to desire you to recommend to his Majesty: That when any new thing shall be propounded to be taken into conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that no Counsellor should suddenly deliver any positive opinion thereof; it is not so easie with all men to retract their opinions, although there shall be cause for it: But only to hear it, and at the most but to break it, at first, that it may be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter understood against the next meeting.</p>
               <p n="8">8. When any matter of weight h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="9">9. I wish also that the King would be pleased sometimes to be present at that Board, it adds a Majesty to it: And yet not to be too frequently
<pb n="864" facs="tcp:64446:357"/>
there, that would render it less esteemed when it is become common; Besides, it may sometimes make the Councellors not to be so free in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates in his presence, as they would be in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Besides the giving of Counsel, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors are bound by their Duties <hi>ex vi termini,</hi> as well as by their Oaths, to keep counsel; therefore are they called <hi>de Privato Consilio Regis, &amp; a secretio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus consiliis Regis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. One thing I add, in the negative, which is not fit for that Board, the entertaining of private causes, of <hi>meum &amp; tuum</hi>; those should be left to the ordinary course and Courts of Justice.</p>
               <p n="12">12. As there is great care to be used for the Councellors themselves to be chosen, so there is of the Clerks of the Council also, for the secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their Consultations; and methinks, it were fit that his Majesty be speedily moved, to give a strict charge, and to bind it with a solemn Order (if it be not already so done) that no copies of the orders of that Table be delivered out by the Clerks of the Councel, but by the order of the Board; nor any not being a Councellor, or a Clerk of the Councel, or his Clerk, to have access to the Councel-Books: and to that purpose, that the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants attending the Clerks of the Councel be bound to secrecy, as well as their Masters.</p>
               <p n="13">13. For the great Offices and Officers of the Kingdom, I shall say little: for the most of them are such, as cannot well be severed from the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellorship; and therefore the same rule is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served for both, in the choice of them: In the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, onely, I advise this, let them be set in

I shall, in a word, and but in a word onely, put you in mind, That the King in his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, both in respect of his Houshold, or Court, and in respect of his whole Kingdom; (for a little Kingdom is but as a great Houshold, and a great Houshold, as a little Kingdom) must be exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>Regis ad exemplum, &amp;c.</hi> But for this, God be praised, our charge is easie; for your Gracious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, for his Learning and Piety, Justice and Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, may be, and is, not onely a president to his own Subjects, but to foreign Princes also; yet he is still but a man, and seasonable <hi>Memento</hi>'s may be use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; and being discreetly used, cannot but take well with him.</item>
                     <item>2. But your greatest care must be, that the great men of his Court (for you must give me leave to be plain with you, for so is your injunction laid upon me) your self in the first place, who is first in the eye of all men, give no just cause of scandal, either by light, or vain, or by oppressive car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</item>

In these things you may sometimes interpose, to do just and good offices: but for the general, I should rather advise, meddle little, but leave the ordering of those Houshold-affairs to the White-staffs, which are those honourable persons, to whom it properly belongeth, to be answerable to the King for it; and to those other Officers of the Green-cloth, who are subordinate to them, as a kind of Councel, and a Court of Justice also.</item>

Of which, when I hear some say it was obvious, I remember that when <hi>Columbus</hi> had discovered <hi>America,</hi> every one said it was easie: And he one day told a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany at Table where he was, that he could do a stranger thing than that discovery; he would make an Egg stand an end on a plain Table: the specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives were at a loss how it should be done;—he knocks the Egg upon the end, and it stands: Oh! was that all, they cryed; <hi>Yes</hi> (saith he) <hi>this is all</hi>! and you see how hard a thing it is to conceive a thing in the <hi>Idea,</hi> which it's nothing to apprehend in the <hi>performance.</hi> I need say no more of this Gentleman, but that Sergeant <hi>Maynard</hi> will say to this hour, he rose mainly at first by being look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon as Mr. <hi>Noy</hi>'s Favourite.</p>

For a Disputation procured by him in <hi>Drury-Lane</hi> (whither he brought Bishop <hi>Vsher</hi> under the notion of a Countrey-Parson; when the Jesuites cryed, <hi>There was more Learning in that Parson, than in all the men in</hi> England.) 2.

His prodiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity it may be might have satisfied the curiosity of a few Strangers, while he incurred the displeasure of all his friends. Besides, a close &amp; wary man may be bountiful at his pleasure, but the munificent cannot be so easily sparing; for if his occasions or fortunes check his profuseness, all his gallantry is in his first action of good husbandry. Caution in expences, if it be a vice, is one of those, saith the <hi>Italian,</hi> that

Nay, of the two, saith <hi>Machiavel, It's more discretion to hold the style of miserable, which begets an infamy without hatred, than to desire that of Liberal; which being maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by necessitous courses, procures an infamy with ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred.</hi> As never did Statesman a brave action that <hi>seemed</hi> illiberal, so never did he any such that <hi>was</hi> not so:—Yet four things our Knight spared no cost in: I.

               <p>One of deep Learning, solid Judgement, inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity of Life, gravity of behaviour, above the envy of his own age, and the scandal of posterity.

               <p>Much more discourses his Lordship was pleased to use at several times to this purpose, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands my charity to clear him, as far as I can judge, of any tincture of Popery truly so called; or of any superstition, which placeth a Religion in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and use of that thing which God hath not ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

I suppose he thought, that where God hath allowed to his Church, and to every private Christian (so far as may consist with the Churches Order and Peace) a liberty of ceremonious and circumstantial decency as to God's worship; there neither himself was to be blamed, nor did he blame other men, if they kept within those discreet and inoffensive bounds, which either the Churches publick peace required, or its indulgence to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Christians permitted.</p>
               <p>The Uniformity he pressed was not more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to Religion, which must of necessity have been propagated, when Controversies had been turned to devotion, than it was necessary for the State; which cannot be secure, as long as there is a mark of distinction, under which all Male con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents may shrowd themselves; a note of separation, whereby the Factions may reckon their parties, and estimate their strength, and a way open to popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity to the ambition of any whose interest or des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perateness shall adventure to make himself head of so great a p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

all Concessions have no other issue than either or both of these two inconveniences. 1. That they make the Faction so insolent, that the King should not be able to deny nor grant them any thing. 2. That they justified former proceedings, and laid the blame upon the King for not granting that sooner, which he thinks fit to grant now.
