            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Britaine the Le≈ø≈øe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(12) Howbeit ≈øome later doe make indeed the South and more Champion to be called <hi>Great

            <p>(13) This neerer part of <hi>Britaine</hi> they then diuided into two parts; for the more Southerne tract,
together with <hi>Wales, Dio</hi> termeth the <hi>Higher,</hi> and that more Northward the <hi>Lower,</hi> as by the ≈øeate
of their Legions doth appeare; for the ≈øecond <hi>Legion Augu≈øta</hi> (which kept at <hi>Caerleon</hi> in <hi>South-Wales)</hi>

of the <hi>Britaines,</hi> and reduced their State vnder his obedience, diuided the gouernment thereof into
two Prouinces, and placed two Prefects ouer the ≈øame.</p>
            <p>(14) After this againe the <hi>Romanes</hi> did apportion <hi>Britaine</hi> into three parts, who≈øe limits our <hi>great
Antiquary</hi> a≈ø≈øigneth by the ancient <hi>Archiepi≈øcopall</hi> Seates, grounding his coniecture on the ≈øaying of
Pope <hi>Lucius,</hi> who affirmes that the Eccle≈øia≈øticall Iuri≈ødictions of the Chri≈øtians, accorded with the

the Emperiall Crowne thereof vpon his owne head: which no ≈øooner was done, but the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> went

tho≈øe Vineyards which they neuer planted; dranke of tho≈øe Wells which they neuer had digged; and inhabitted

at fir≈øt to ≈øettle them≈øelues in this faire≈øt and fruitfulle≈øt part of the Iland; the Conquerour v≈øing all
policie both Martiall and Ciuill, to plant his po≈øteritie here for euer. How he found the Land go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned

it, chiefly for the good of the people, and better mini≈øtring of Iu≈øtice, he made v≈øe of it, to know the
wealth of his Subiects, and to enrich his Coffers: for <hi>he cau≈øed a de≈øcription to be made of all England,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>(3) For the Lawes by which he meant to gouerne, he held one excellent rule and purpo≈øe, which
was, that <hi>a People ought to be ruled by Lawes written and certaine:</hi> for otherwi≈øe new Iudges would
≈øtill bring new Iudgements: and therefore he cau≈øed <hi>twelue to be cho≈øen out of euery Countie, which

            <p>DEVON-SHIRE, by the <hi>Corni≈øh Britaines</hi> called <hi>Deuinan;</hi> and by contraction of the vulgar

            <p>(2) The We≈øt of this County is bounded altogether by the Riuer <hi>Tamar:</hi> the Ea≈øt is held

            <p>SVVMMERSET-SHIRE is both a rich and ≈øpacious Countrey, hauing the <hi>Seuerne Sea</hi> beating
vpon it on the North-≈øide, the South part bordering vpon <hi>Deuon</hi> and <hi>Dor≈øet ≈øhires,</hi> the We≈øt
confined with <hi>Deuon-≈øhire,</hi> and the Ea≈øt and North-Ea≈øt vpon <hi>Wilt≈øhire,</hi> and <hi>Glouce≈øter-≈øhire.</hi>
It tooke the name of <hi>Sommerton</hi> (≈øometime the chiefe Towne of this Shire) whence in the
ancient Hi≈øtorian <hi>A≈ø≈øerius,</hi> this Countie is called <hi>Sommertunen≈øis,</hi> that is, <hi>Sommertun-≈øhire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(2) The forme thereof is large, bearing it ≈øelfe ≈øtill wider as it ≈øtretcheth into the middle part
thereof, and containes in length from <hi>Brackley</hi> neere vnto <hi>Frome-Selwood</hi> Ea≈øtward, to <hi>Oure</hi> in the

fortie miles. The whole circumference is about 204. miles.</p>
            <p>(3) The ayre is milde and plea≈øing, and for the mo≈øt part ≈øubiect to ≈øuch temperate di≈øpo≈øitions
as the Sommer-≈øea≈øon affordeth, whence ≈øome haue erroniou≈øly conceited, that the Region borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

≈øo full of wet, ≈øo myrie and moori≈øh it is; in ≈øo much as the Inhabitants can hardly tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell

            <p>(4) Howbeit they pa≈ø≈øe ouer this with all patience, knowing their en≈øuing ≈øea≈øonable profits
farre to exceede any pre≈øent detriments and di≈øplea≈øures: for as it is foule, ≈øo it is fruitfull, which

held to be the be≈øt in the Land: the Soile is rich, fruitfull, and with all things well repleni≈øhed; in a

            <p>BEDFORD-SHIRE, ≈øeated in the South-Ea≈øt of this <hi>Iland,</hi> is a plaine and champion Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,

miles.</p>
            <p>(3) The Ayre is temperate, and the Soile bounteous, e≈øpecially the North, who≈øe Borders the

places be ≈øprinkled with Pa≈øturage and Woods.</p>
            <p>(4) The ancient Inhabitants knowne to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> that held in this Shire, were part of the
<hi>Cattieuchlani,</hi> a ≈øtout and warre-≈øtrring people: and yet vpon the report of <hi>Cae≈øars</hi> proceeding, ≈øent
him their ≈øubiection for peace. But when that conquering Nation had brought <hi>Britaine</hi> into a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince</hi>
vnder <hi>Rome,</hi> their Legions lay at <hi>Selenae</hi> and <hi>Magintum,</hi> which are now <hi>Sandy</hi> and <hi>Dun≈øtable,</hi>

≈øhortly ≈øhould ari≈øe.</p>
            <p>(6) This Countie, among the common calamities of the Land, when it lay trampied vnder the
fect of the <hi>Danes,</hi> ≈øu≈øtained a part: and after that, in the time of King <hi>Stephen,</hi> when the <hi>Ciuill Warres</hi>
thundred betwixt <hi>Maud</hi> the <hi>Empre≈ø≈øe</hi> and him≈øelfe, the Shire-Towne was ≈øore wa≈øted, with great
≈ølaughter of men: So when the <hi>Barons</hi> for≈øooke their allegeance to King <hi>Iohn,</hi> the Towne and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtle
were rendred vp vnto their hands: and la≈øtly, by King <hi>Henry</hi> the third, laid leuell euen with the

            <p>(7) This Towne by the <hi>Britaines</hi> was called <hi>Lettidur;</hi> and of vs, <hi>Bedford:</hi> being the chiefe≈øt in

of a theefe named <hi>Dun,</hi> by King <hi>Henry</hi> the fir≈øt: but certaine it is the place was formerly held by the

CHAPTER XXIII.</head>
            <p>GLOCESTER-SHIRE, lyeth bordered vpon the North with <hi>Worce≈øter</hi> and <hi>Warwicke-≈øhires,</hi>
vpon the Ea≈øt with <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Wile≈øhire;</hi> vpon the South altogether with <hi>Sommer≈øet-≈øhire:</hi>
and vpon the We≈øt with the Riuer <hi>Wye</hi> and <hi>Hereford-≈øhire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(2) The length thereof extended from <hi>Bri≈øtow</hi> vpon the Riuer <hi>Auon</hi> in her South, vnto
<hi>Clifford</hi> vpon another <hi>Auon</hi> in her North, are about fortie eight miles; and her broade≈øt part
from Ea≈øt to We≈øt, is from <hi>Lechlad</hi> vnto <hi>Pre≈øton,</hi> containing twentie eight: the whole circumference
about one hundred thirtie eight miles.</p>
            <p>(3) <hi>The forme whereof is ≈øomewhat long and narrow: the Ayre thereof is plea≈øant, ≈øweet and
delectable: and for fruitfulne≈ø≈øe of Soile heare</hi> Malmesbury <hi>and not me:</hi> The ground of this Shire
throughout <hi>(≈øaith he)</hi> yeeldeth plentie of Corne, and bringeth forth abundance of fruits; the one through
the naturall goodne≈ø≈øe onely of the ground, the other through the diligent manuring and tillage, in ≈øuch wi≈øe,
that it would prouoke the lazie≈øt per≈øon to take paines Here you may ≈øee the High-wayes and Common Lanes
clad with Apple trees and Peare trees, not ingrafted by the indu≈øtry of mans hand, but growing naturally of
their owne accord: the ground of it ≈øelfe is ≈øo inclined to beare fruits, and tho≈øe both in ta≈øte and beautie farre
exceeding others, and will endure vntill a new ≈øupply come. There is not any Country in <hi>England</hi> ≈øo thicke
≈øet with Vineyards as this Prouince is, ≈øo plentifull of increa≈øe, and ≈øo plea≈øant in ta≈øte. The very wines made
thereof carry no vnplea≈øant tartne≈ø≈øe, as being little inferiour in ≈øweet verdure to the French wines; the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes
are innumerable, the Churches pa≈øsing faire, and the Townes ≈øtanding very thicke. But that which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
vnto all good gifts (a ≈øpeciall glory) is the Riuer <hi>Seuerne,</hi> then which there is not any in all the Land, for

Channell broader, for Streame ≈øwifter, or for Fi≈øh better ≈øtored. There is in it a daily rage and fury of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
which I know not whether I may call a Gulfe or Whirle-pole of waues, rai≈øing vp the ≈øands from the

vpon the face of her bordering grounds, and againe retyreth as a Conquerour into the v≈øuall Channell. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
is the Ve≈ø≈øell which it taketh full vpon the ≈øide: but the Water-men well ware thereof, when they ≈øee
that Hydra comming, turne the Ve≈ø≈øell vpon it, and cut thorow the mid≈øt of it, whereby they checke and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyd
her violence and danger.</p>
            <p>(4) The ancient people that po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed this Prouince, were the DOBVNI, who ≈øpread them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelues
further into <hi>Oxford ≈øhire.</hi> But betwixt the <hi>Seuerne</hi> and <hi>Wye</hi> were ≈øeated part of SILVRES,
or Inhabitants of <hi>South Wales.</hi> And vpon what ground I know not, let <hi>Lawyers</hi> di≈øpute it, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
in ≈øome part of this Shire enioy a priuate cu≈øtome to this day, that the Goods and Lands
of <hi>Condemned Per≈øons</hi> fall vnto the Crowne but onely for a yeare and a day, and then returne to the

            </p>
            <p>(5) The general Commodities of this Shire, are <hi>Corne, Iron,</hi> and <hi>Wools,</hi> all pa≈ø≈øing fine, be≈øides

            <p>(4) The <hi>Saxons</hi> then made them≈øelues Lords of this Land, and this Prouince a part of their

            <p>The greate≈øt glory that this Citie receiued, was in King <hi>Athel≈øtans</hi> dayes; where (as <hi>Malmesbury</hi>

            </p>
            <p>(2) The forme thereof is triangle, but not of equall proportion; for from North to South are
thirtie two miles, from South to North-We≈øt twenty two, and from thence to her North-Ea≈øt point
are twenty eight: the whole in Circumference is one hundred and twentie miles.</p>
            <p>(3) The Ayre in this Shire is of a fauourable temperature, that giues an appetite for labour, diet,
and re≈øt: the Soyle is fertile, and to me ≈øeemed inferiour to notice other in this Land: for be≈øides the
abundance of Corne in euery place ≈øpread, the Woods and Pa≈øturage in her hils and plaines, ≈øweet
Riuers that water the vallies below, and Cattle that couer the tops of higher ground; the Fields,
Hedge-rowes, and High-wayes are be≈øet with fruitfull Peare-trees, that yeeld great plea≈øure to ≈øight,
and commodious v≈øe: for with their iuyce they make a ba≈øtard kinde of Wine, called <hi>Perry,</hi> which
is both plea≈øant and good in ta≈øte. Many <hi>Salt Springs</hi> al≈øo this County affordeth; yea, and more

            <p>(5) Which is mo≈øt plea≈øantly ≈øeated, pa≈ø≈øing well frequented, and very richly inhabited. This

This Citie by <hi>Hardy Canute</hi> in the yeare of Chri≈øt 1041. was ≈øorely endangered, and ≈øet on fire, and

            <p>This City is gouerned by two Bailiffes, two Aldermen, two Chamberlaines, and two Con≈øtables,

CHAPTER XXVII.</head>
            <p>NORTHAMPTON-SHIRE, ≈øituated neere vnto the midde≈øt of <hi>England,</hi> lyeth ≈øepartted
vpon the North from <hi>Lincoln-≈øhire</hi> by the Riuer <hi>W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

is parted by the water <hi>Nene:</hi> her South is bounded with <hi>Buckingham</hi> and <hi>Oxford ≈øhires,</hi> and
the We≈øt from <hi>Warwicke</hi> with <hi>Watling-≈øtreet-way, Auon,</hi> and <hi>Weland,</hi> is diuided from <hi>Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈øter-≈øhire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(2) The forme of this Countie is large and narrow, broade≈øt in the South-we≈øt; and thence
≈øhooting ≈øtill le≈ø≈øer like vnto a Horne, nor not much vnlike to the forme of <hi>Cornwall:</hi> and from the
entrance of <hi>Cherwell</hi> into this Shire, vnto the fall of <hi>Weland</hi> and <hi>Nene</hi> neere vnto <hi>Crowland,</hi> are by
mea≈øure fortie ≈øixe miles; and the broade≈øt part is from <hi>Ou≈øe</hi> vnto <hi>Auon,</hi> which is not fully twentie
miles: the whole in circumference one hundred and nineteene miles<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
            </p>
            <p>(3) The aire is good, temperate, and healthfull: the ≈øoile is champion, rich, and fruitfull, and
≈øo plenteou≈øly peopled, that from ≈øome A≈øcents, thirtie Pari≈øh-Churches, and many more Wind-milles
at one view may be ≈øeene: notwith≈øtanding the ≈øimple and gentle ≈øheepe, of all creatures the
mo≈øt harmele≈ø≈øe, are now become ≈øo rauenous, that they begin to deuoure men, wa≈øte fields, and
depopulate hou≈øes, if not whole Towne-≈øhips, as one merily hath written.</p>
            <p>(4) The antient people knowne to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and recorded by <hi>Ptolemie,</hi> were the <hi>Coritani,</hi> who
po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed this Country, and were branched further thorow <hi>Leice≈øter, Lincolne, Nottingham, Rutland,</hi>
and <hi>Darbie-≈øhires:</hi> the≈øe ioyning with the <hi>Irenians,</hi> with them were fettered with the chaines of ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection,
when for <hi>Claudius, Publius O≈øtrius Scapula</hi> entred his Lieutenant≈øhip in <hi>Britaine,</hi> and in
<pb facs="tcp:3363:83"/>
battle ≈øubdued all betwixt the Riuers <hi>Nene</hi> and <hi>Sabrina.</hi> But when the <hi>Romans</hi> were content to let
goe that which ≈øo long was de≈øired, and had co≈øt ≈øo much in the getting, the <hi>Saxons,</hi> a mo≈øt warlike
Nation put into the≈øe parts, and made it a portion of their <hi>Mercian Kingdome:</hi> but their gouernment
al≈øo growne out of date, the <hi>Normans</hi> ≈øeated them≈øelues in the≈øe faire po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions, the branches of
whole Stemmes are ≈øpread abroad in the≈øe parts, mo≈øt fruitfull and faire.</p>
            <p>(5) Commodities ari≈øing in this Shire, are chiefly gotten by tillage and plough, whereby corne
≈øo plentifully aboundeth, that in no other Countie is found more, or ≈øo much: the pa≈øtures and
woods are filled with Cattle, and euery where ≈øheepe loaden with their fleeces of wooll.</p>
            <p>(6) The chiefe Towne in this Shire is <hi>Northampton,</hi> whereof the Countie taketh name, which
for circuit, beautie, and building, may be ranked with the mo≈øt of the Cities of our Land. It is ≈øea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
at the meeting and confluence of two Riuers, the greater whereof beareth to name <hi>Nen.</hi> This
Towne hath beene built all of ≈øtone, as by many foundations remaining to this day is ≈øeene, and is
walled about both ≈øtrong and high, excepting the We≈øt, which is defended by a Riuer parted into
many ≈øtreames. In the depredations of the <hi>Danes, Suen</hi> their King ≈øet this Towne on fire, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
it was ≈øorely a≈ø≈øulted by the di≈øobedient <hi>Barons</hi> of King <hi>Iohn,</hi> who named them≈øelues, <hi>The
Ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ie of God:</hi> But the loyaltie of this Towne ≈øtood nothing ≈øo ≈øure vnto King <hi>Henry</hi> his ≈øonne,
whence the <hi>Barons</hi> with di≈øplayed Banners ≈øounded the Battle again≈øt their Soueraigne. And yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this a woefull Field of <hi>Englands</hi> ciuill diui≈øion was fought, whence <hi>Richard Neuil</hi> the ≈øtout Earle
of <hi>Warwicke,</hi> lead away pri≈øoner that vnfortunate man King <hi>Henry</hi> the ≈øixth. Vpon the We≈øt part of
this Towne ≈øtandeth a large Ca≈øtle, mounted vpon an hill, who≈øe aged countenance well ≈øheweth
the beautie that ≈øhe hath borne, and who≈øe gaping chinkes doe daily threaten the downefall of her
walles. To this vpon the South the Townes wall adioyneth, and in a round circuit meeteth the
Riuer in the North, extending in compa≈ø≈øe two thou≈øand one hundred and twentie pa≈øes: who≈øe

36. ≈øcruples for Latitude, and in Longitude is remoued from the We≈øt 19 degrees and 40 ≈øcruples;
being yearely gouerned by a Maior, two Bailiffes, twelue Magi≈øtrates, a Recorder, Towne-Clerke,
a Common Coun≈øell of fortie eight Burge≈ø≈øes, with fiue Sergeants to execute bu≈øine≈ø≈øe.</p>
            <p>(7) But the deuotions of the <hi>Saxon-Kings</hi> made <hi>Peterborow</hi> more famous, formerly called <hi>Med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de≈øwell,</hi>
where <hi>Wolphere</hi> King of <hi>Mercia</hi> began a mo≈øt ≈øtately Mona≈øtery to the honour of S. <hi>Peter,</hi>
for ≈øatisfaction of the bloud of his two ≈øonnes, whom he had murdered in ca≈øe of Chri≈øtianitie:
but him≈øelfe being for the like made away by his mother, his brother <hi>Penda</hi> continued the worke,
with the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of his brother <hi>Ethelred,</hi> and two ≈øi≈øters, <hi>Kineburga</hi> and <hi>Kine≈øwith.</hi> This among
the <hi>Dani≈øh De≈øobutions</hi> was ca≈øt downe, yet was it againe re≈øtored to greater beautie by <hi>Ethelwold</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhop

of Con≈øcience, that in bed with his wife had ouerlaid and ≈ømoothered an Infant their onely ≈øonne,
laid all his wealth vpon the reedifying of the place, and then became <hi>Abbot</hi> thereof him≈øelfe. The

called it, for that <hi>Roet</hi> and <hi>Rut</hi> is in their tongue <hi>Red</hi> with vs, and may very well giue the
name to this Prouince, ≈øeeing the earth doth ≈øtaine the wooll of her ≈øheepe into a reddi≈øh colour.
Neither is it ≈øtrange, that the ≈øtaine of the ≈øoyle giues names vnto places, and that very many: for

The Soile is rich, and for Corne and tillage giues place vnto none. Woods there are plentie, and

            <p>LEICESTER-SHIRE, lying bordered vpon the North with <hi>Nottingham-≈øhire;</hi> vpon the
Ea≈øt, with <hi>Lincolne</hi> and <hi>Rutland;</hi> vpon the South with <hi>Northampton ≈øhire;</hi> and vpon the We≈øt
with <hi>Watling-≈øtreet-way</hi> is parted from <hi>Warwick-≈øhire;</hi> the re≈øt being bounded with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øines
of <hi>Darby,</hi> is a Country Champion, abounding in corne, but ≈øpary of woods, e≈øpecially in
the South and Ea≈øt parts, which are ≈øupplyed with pit-coales plenteou≈øly gotten in the North
of this Prouince, and with abundance of Cattle bred in the hilles beyond the Riuer <hi>Wreak,</hi> which is
nothing ≈øo well inhabited as the re≈øt.</p>
            <p>(2) The Ayre is gentle, milde, and temperate, and giueth appetite both to labour and re≈øt:
whole≈øome it is, and draweth mans life to a long age, and that much without ≈øickne≈ø≈øe; at <hi>Carleton</hi>
onely ≈øome defect of pronunciation appeareth in their ≈øpeech.</p>
            <p>(3) The ≈øoile thus con≈øi≈øting, the commodities are rai≈øed accordingly of Corne, Cattle, and
Coales; and in the Rockes neere <hi>Beuer</hi> are ≈øometimes found the <hi>A≈øtroites,</hi> the Starre-like precious
Stone.</p>
            <p>(4) The ancient people that inhabited this Countie, were the <hi>Coritani,</hi> who were ≈øpread further
into other Shires, but after that the <hi>Romans</hi> had left the Land to it ≈øelfe, this with many more fell
to be vnder the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion and gouernment of the <hi>Mercians,</hi> and their Kings, from whom the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øh</hi>
enioyeth it at this day.</p>
            <p>(5) In Circular-wi≈øe (almo≈øt) the compa≈ø≈øe of this Shire is drawne indifferently ≈øpacious, but
not very thicke of Inclo≈øures, being from <hi>Ea≈øt</hi> to We≈øt in the broade≈øt part not fully 30. miles, and
<pb facs="tcp:3363:94"/>
from North to South but 24. the whole circumference about 196. miles; who≈øe principall Citie is
≈øet, as the Center, almo≈øt in the mid≈øt; from whom the Pole is eleuated 53. degrees and 4 minutes
in Latitude, and for Longitude, 19. degrees, 22. minutes.</p>
            <p>(6) From this Towne the Shire hath the name, though the name of her ≈øelfe is diuer≈øly written,
as <hi>Legece≈øtria, Legora, Legeo-ce≈øter:</hi> by <hi>Ninius, Caer-Lerion;</hi> by <hi>Mathew</hi> of <hi>We≈øtmini≈øter</hi> (if we doe
not mi≈øtake him) <hi>Wirall;</hi> and now la≈øtly, <hi>Leice≈øter:</hi> ancient enough if King <hi>Leir</hi> was her builder,
eight hundred fortie and foure yeares before the birth of our Sauiour, wherein he placed a Flamine
to ≈øerue in the Temple of <hi>Ianus,</hi> by him≈øelfe there erected, and where he was buried, if <hi>Ieffery ap Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur</hi>
≈øay true: but now certaine it is, that <hi>Ethelred</hi> the <hi>Mercian</hi> Monarch made it an Epi≈øcopall See,
in the yeare of Chri≈øt Ie≈øus 680. wherein <hi>Sexwulph</hi> of his election became the fir≈øt Bi≈øhop: which
≈øhortly after was thence tran≈ølated, and therewith the beautie of the Towne began to decay; vpon
who≈øe de≈øolations that erectifying Lady <hi>Edel≈øted</hi> ca≈øt her eyes of compa≈ø≈øion, and both reedified the
buildings, and compa≈ø≈øed it about with a ≈øtrong wall, where, in ≈øhort time the Cities trade ≈øo increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed,
that <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> in his le≈ø≈øer Story reporteth as followeth; <hi>Lege-ce≈øter</hi> (≈øaith he) <hi>is a right
wealthy Citie, and notably defended; and had the wall a ≈øure foundation, were inferiour to no Citie what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoeuer.</hi>
But this pride of pro≈øperitie long la≈øted not vnder the <hi>Normans,</hi> for it was ≈øore oppre≈ø≈øed with
a world of calamities, when <hi>Robert Bo≈ø≈øu</hi> the Crouch-backe Earle of that <hi>Prouince,</hi> rebelled again≈øt
his Soueraigne Lord King <hi>Henry</hi> the ≈øecond: whereof heare the ≈øame Author <hi>Paris</hi> ≈øpeake: <hi>Through
the ob≈øtinate ≈øtubborne≈ø≈øe of Earle</hi> Robert (≈øaith he) <hi>the noble Citie</hi> Leice≈øter <hi>was be≈øieged and throwne
downe by King</hi> Henry, <hi>and the wall that ≈øeemed indi≈ø≈øoluble, was vtterly raced, euen to the ground.</hi>
The peeces of who≈øe fragments ≈øo fallen downe, remained in his dayes like to hard rockes, through
the ≈øtrength of the Morter cementing whole lumpes together: and at the Kings command the Citie
was ≈øet on fire and burnt, the Ca≈øtle raced, and a heauit impo≈øition laid vpon the Citizens, who with

great ≈øummes of money bought their owne Bani≈øhments: but were ≈øo v≈øed in their departure, that

CHAPTER XXXII.</head>
            <p>NOTTINGHAM-SHIRE (from <hi>Nottingham</hi> her chiefe≈øt Towne hath the name; and
that, ≈øomewhat ≈øoftned from the <hi>Saxons</hi> Snoddenzaham, for the many Dennes or Caues
wrought in her Rocks and vnder ground) lyeth bordered vpon the North &amp; North we≈øt
with <hi>York-≈øhire;</hi> vpon the Ea≈øt a good di≈øtance by <hi>Trent</hi> is parted froM, and with <hi>Lincoln-≈øhire</hi>
altogether confined: the South with <hi>Leice≈øter-≈øhire;</hi> and the We≈øt by the Riuer <hi>Erwa≈øh</hi>
is ≈øeperated from <hi>Darby-≈øhire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(2) For forme long and Ouall-wi≈øe, doubling in length twice her bredth, who≈øe extreames
are thus extended and di≈øtance ob≈øerued: From <hi>Finingley</hi> North to <hi>Sleanford</hi> in the South, are thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
eight <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> miles; her We≈øt part from <hi>Teuer≈øall</hi> to <hi>Be≈øthorp</hi> in the Ea≈øt, are little more then nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene;
who≈øe circumference draweth much vpon one hundred and ten miles.</p>
            <p>(3) The Ayre is good, whole≈øome and delectable: the Soile is rich, ≈øandy and clayie, as by the
names of that Counties diui≈øions may appeare: and ≈øurely for Corne and Gra≈ø≈øe ≈øo fruitfull, that it
≈øecondeth any other in the Realme: and for Water, Woods, and Canell Coales abundantly ≈øto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>

then that of <hi>Paris:</hi> wherewith they flower their vpper roomes; for betwixt the Ioy≈øts they lay one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

In the We≈øt neere <hi>Work≈øop</hi> groweth plentie of <hi>Liquorice,</hi> very delicious and good.</p>
            <p>(5) More South in this Shire, at <hi>Stoke,</hi> in the Raigne of King <hi>Henry</hi> the ≈øeauenth, a great battle
was fought by <hi>Iohn De-la-Pole</hi> Earle of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> which <hi>Richard</hi> the V≈øurper had declared his heire ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant;
but <hi>Richard</hi> lo≈øing his life, and <hi>De-la Pole</hi> his hopes, in ≈øeeking here to ≈øet vp a <hi>Lambert,</hi> fell
downe him≈øelfe: and at <hi>Newarke</hi> after many troubles King <hi>Iohn</hi> got his peace with the end of his
life.</p>
            <p>(6) Trade and commerce for the Counties proui≈øion is frequented in eight Market-Townes
in this Shire, whereof <hi>Nottingham</hi> is both the greate≈øt and be≈øt: a Towne ≈øeated mo≈øt plea≈øant and

Ca≈øtle of an e≈øpeciall note, one for the ≈øtory of <hi>Chri≈øts</hi> Pa≈ø≈øion engrauen in the Walls, and cut by the
hand of <hi>Dauid</hi> the ≈øecond King of <hi>Scots,</hi> whil≈øt he was therein detained pri≈øoner. Another wherein
Lord <hi>Mortimer</hi> was ≈øurpri≈øed in the non-age of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, euer ≈øince beating the
name of <hi>Mortimers Hole;</hi> the≈øe haue their ≈øtaires and ≈øeuerall roomes made artifically euen out of the
Rockes: as al≈øo in that hill are dwelling hou≈øes, with winding ≈øtaires, windowes, chimneys, and
roome aboue roome, wrought all out of the ≈øolide Rocke. The Ca≈øtle is ≈øtrong, and was kept by
the <hi>Danes</hi> again≈øt <hi>Burthred, Ethelred,</hi> and <hi>Elfred,</hi> the <hi>Mercian,</hi> and <hi>We≈øt-Saxon</hi> Kings, who together
laid their ≈øiege again≈øt it: and for the further ≈øtrength of the Towne, King <hi>Edward,</hi> ≈øurnamed the
Elder, walled it about, whereof ≈øome part as yet remaines, from the Ca≈øtle to the We≈øt-gate, and
thence the foundation may be perceiued to the North; where in the mid≈øt of the way ranging with

Climate be cold, and toucheth the degree of Latitude 54. yet the warmth from the <hi>Iri≈øh Seas</hi> mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth

kinde to their kindred, ≈øpary of labour, void of di≈øimulation, not greedie meating, and far from dangerous

            <p>And let me adde thus much, which <hi>Lucian</hi> could not; namely, that this Shire hath neuer beene

            <p>(2) The forme thereof is long, for it is ≈øo inclo≈øed betweene <hi>Yorke ≈øhire</hi> on the Ea≈øt ≈øide, and
the <hi>Iri≈øh Sea</hi> on the We≈øt, that where it boundeth vpon <hi>Che≈øhire</hi> on the South-≈øide, it is broader, and

to the world, of the ble≈ø≈øed abundance that it hath plea≈øed God to enrich this noble Dukedome
withall.</p>
            <p>(5) This Counties ancient Inhabitants were the <hi>Brigantes,</hi> of whom there is more mention in
the de≈øcription of <hi>Yorke≈øhire,</hi> who by <hi>Claudius</hi> the Emperour were brought vnder the <hi>Roman</hi> ≈øubiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that ≈øo held and made it their Seat, ≈øecured by their Garri≈øons, as hath beene gathered as well
by many in≈øcriptions found in walles and ancient monuments fixed in ≈øtones, as by certaine Altars
erected in fauour of their Emperours. After the <hi>Romans,</hi> the <hi>Saxons</hi> brought it vnder their protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and held it for a part of their <hi>Northumbrian</hi> Kingdome, till it was fir≈øt made ≈øubiugate to the
inua≈øion of the <hi>Danes,</hi> and then conquered by the victorious <hi>Normans,</hi> who≈øe po≈øterities from thence
are branched further into <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(6) Places of antiquitie or memorable note are the≈øe: the Towne of <hi>Manche≈øter</hi> (≈øo famous, as
well for the Market-place, Church, and Colledge, as for the re≈øort vnto it for clothing) was called
<hi>Mancunium</hi> by <hi>Antonine</hi> the Emperour, and was made a Fort and Station of the <hi>Romans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ribleche≈øter</hi> (which taketh the name from <hi>Rhibell,</hi> a little Riuer neere <hi>Clithero)</hi> though it be a ≈ømall
Towne, yet by tradition hath beene called the riche≈øt Towne in Chri≈øtendome, and reported to

            <p>But the Shire-Towne is <hi>Lanca≈øter,</hi> more plea≈øant in ≈øituation, then rich of Inhabitants, built on

CHAPTER XXXVIII.</head>
            <p>AS the cour≈øes and confluents of great Riuers are for the mo≈øt part fre≈øh in memory, though
their heads and fountaines lie commonly vnknowne: ≈øo the latter knowledge of great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions,
are not traduced to obliuion, though perhaps their fir≈øt originals be ob≈øcure, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon
of Antiquitie, and the many reuolutions of times and ages<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> In the delineation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of this great Prouince of <hi>York≈øhire,</hi> I will not in≈øi≈øt vpon the narration of matters neere
vnto vs; but ≈øuccinctly run ouer ≈øuch as are more remote; yet neither ≈øo ≈øparingly, as I may ≈øeeme
to dimini≈øh from the dignitie of ≈øo worthy a Country; nor ≈øo prodigally, as to ≈øpend time in the
≈øuperfluous prai≈øing of that which neuer any (as yet) di≈øprai≈øed. And although perhaps it may ≈øeeme
a labour vnnece≈ø≈øary, to make relation of ancient remembrances, either of the Name or Nature of
this Nation, e≈øpecially looking into the difference of Time it ≈øelfe (which in euery age bringeth
forth diuer≈øe effects) and the di≈øpo≈øitions of men, that for the mo≈øt part take le≈ø≈øe plea≈øure in them,
then in divulging the occurrents of their owne times: yet I hold it not vnfit to begin there, from
whence the fir≈øt certaine direction is giuen to proceede; for (euen of the≈øe ancient things) there may
be good v≈øe made, eitherby imitation, or way of compari≈øon, as neither the repetition, nor the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition
thereof ≈øhall be accounted impertinent.</p>
            <p>(2) You ≈øhall therefore vnder≈øtand: That the Countie of <hi>Yorke</hi> was in the <hi>Saxon</hi> tongue called
<hi>Ebona-yeyne,</hi> and now commonly <hi>Yorke≈øhire,</hi> farre greater and more numerous in the Circuit of her
miles, then any Shire of <hi>England.</hi> Shee is much bound to the ≈øingular loue and motherly ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

<pb facs="tcp:3363:115"/>
If one part of her be ≈øtony, and a ≈øandy barren ground: another is fertile and richly adorned with
Corne-fields. If you here finde it naked, and de≈øtitute of Woods, you ≈øhall ≈øee it there ≈øhadowed
with Forre≈øts full of trees, that haue very thicke <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
               </gap>, ≈øending forth many fruitfull and profitable
branches. If one place of it be Moori≈øh, Mirie, and vnplea≈øant; another makes a free tender of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
and pre≈øents it ≈øelfe to the eye, full of beautie and contentiue varietie.</p>
            <p>(3) The Bi≈øhopricke of <hi>Durham</hi> fronts her on the North-≈øide, and is ≈øeperated by a continued
cour≈øe of the Riuer <hi>Tees</hi> The <hi>Germaine Sea</hi> lieth ≈øore vpon her Ba≈øt ≈øide, beating the ≈øhores with her
boi≈øterous waues and billowes. The We≈øt part is bounded with <hi>Lanca≈øhire,</hi> and <hi>We≈øtmerland.</hi> The
South-≈øide hath <hi>Che≈øhire</hi> and <hi>Darbi≈øhire</hi> (friendly Neighbours vnto her) with the which ≈øhe is fir≈øt
inclo≈øed: then with <hi>Nottingham</hi> and with <hi>Lincolne-≈øhires:</hi> after diuided with that famous Arme of the
Sea <hi>Humber:</hi> Into which all the Riuers that water this Country, emptie them≈øelues, and pay their
ordinary Tributes, as into the common receptacle and ≈øtore-hou≈øe of <hi>Neptune,</hi> for all the watery Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions
of this Prouince.</p>
            <p>(4) This whole Shire (being of it ≈øelfe ≈øo ≈øpatious) for the more ea≈øie and better ordering of her
ciuill gouernment, is diuided into three parts: which according to three quarters of the world, are
called <hi>The We≈øt-Riding, The Ea≈øt-Riding,</hi> and <hi>The North-Riding. We≈øt-Riding</hi> is for a good ≈øpace com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa≈ø≈øed
with the Riuer <hi>Ou≈øe,</hi> with the bounds of <hi>Lanca≈øhire,</hi> and with the South limits of the Shire, and
beareth towards the We≈øt and South. <hi>Ea≈øt-Riding</hi> bends it ≈øelfe to the Ocean, with the which, and

            <p>(8) Many places of this Prouince are famou≈øed as well by Name, being naturally fortunate in
their ≈øituation, as for ≈øome other accidentall happine≈ø≈øe befallen vnto them. <hi>Hallifax,</hi> famous, as

            <p>In former times it was called <hi>Horton,</hi> and touching the alteration of the name, this prety ≈øtory is
<pb facs="tcp:3363:116"/>

no meanes either of long pray≈øes or large promi≈øes, able to gaine like affection at her hands, when he
≈øaw his hopes fru≈øtrate, and that he was not like to haue his purpo≈øe of her, turned his loue into rage,
and cut off the maides head, which being afterwards hung vpon an Ewe tree, common people coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

it maintained the opinion of reuerence and Religion ≈øtill: for the people re≈øorted thither on pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
and per≈øwaded them≈øelues, that the little veynes that ≈øpread out betweene the Barke and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

and full of magnificence, rich, populous, and not onely ≈øtrengthened with fortifications, but ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

an Epi≈øcopall See by <hi>Con≈øtantius,</hi> and a Metropolitane Citie by a <hi>Pall</hi> ≈øent vnto it from <hi>Homorius.

            <p>The originall of this Citie cannot be fetcht out but from the <hi>romanes,</hi> ≈øeeing the <hi>Britaines</hi> before

            <p>Other matters of ob≈øeruation are onely the≈øe, that North <hi>Tyne</hi> (running through the <hi>Wall)</hi>

(5) This commoditie makes this Iland more happie then we are here: for the people are there
free from vnnece≈ø≈øary commencements of Suites, from long and dilatory Pleas, and from friuolous
feeing of Lawyers No Iudge or Clerks of the Court take there any penny for drawing In≈øtruments,

            <p>(7) This Iland ≈øo ≈ømall in account either for compa≈ø≈øe or Commoditie, and ≈øo vnpeopled and

Northwe≈øt nine miles; and is in circuit thirtie ≈øixe miles. The Emperour <hi>Antonine</hi> hauing
the rule and domination of <hi>France</hi> (at that time called <hi>Gaule,</hi> from whence the word <hi>Gallia</hi>
is deriued) did name this Iland <hi>Sarnia,</hi> which afterward by the change of Times and corruption of
Languages, was long ≈øince (and is at this day) called <hi>Garn≈øey.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(2) This Ile in forme and fa≈øhion ≈øtandeth in the Sea, much like to a Parke that is incompa≈ø≈øed
round about with a Pale of Rockes, being very defen≈øible vnto the Iland from the attempting inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
of enemies.</p>
               <p>(3) The Aire and Climate of this Ile hath little or no difference in temper or qualitie from that
of <hi>Ier≈øey.</hi> And this de≈øerues to be remembred of it; that in this Ile is neither Toade, Snake, Adder,
or any other venemous creature, and the other hath great plentie.</p>
               <p>(4) It ≈øtandeth for the mo≈øt part vpon a rocke, very high in many places from the Sea. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thele≈ø≈øe
the Soile is very fruitfull, yeelding forth great plentie of gra≈ø≈øe for their Sheepe and other
Cattell, which they haue to ≈øerue all v≈øes<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> Their fields in the Summer time are ≈øo naturally garni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhed
with flowers of all ≈øorts, that a man (being there) might conceit him≈øelfe to be in a plea≈øant
artificiall garden.</p>
               <p>(5) The Inhabitants are not ≈øo much giuen to tillage as they of <hi>Ier≈øey,</hi> though the ≈øoile be as
fruitfull. They haue of late taken great delight in planting and ≈øetting of trees of all ≈øorts, and e≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
of Apples, by rea≈øon whereof they make much Cider. Their commodities are alike, and their
helpes from the Sea no le≈ø≈øe, or rather more.</p>

(6) In this Ile are many great ≈øteepe Rocks, among which is found a hard ≈øtone called by the
<hi>Frenchmen Smyris,</hi> which we terme <hi>Emerill.</hi> This ≈øtone is ≈øeruiceable for many purpo≈øes, and many
Trades, as Gla≈øiers, &amp;c. but e≈øpecially for the Gold≈ømiths and Lapidaries, to cut their precious
≈øtones.</p>
               <p>(7) It hath a head of Land vpon the North part thereof, the pa≈ø≈øage into which is ≈øo narrow,
that a man would thinke that at euery Tyde (the Sea beating ≈øtrongly on both ≈øides) it were in a
continuall danger to be ≈øundred from the other part of the Ile. This place is called S. <hi>Michaelin the
Vale,</hi> where (in former times) ≈øtood a Priory, or a Couent of religious per≈øons, the ruines where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
are at this day to be ≈øeene.</p>
               <p>(8) The gouernment of this Ile, in nature and forme re≈øembles the other of <hi>Ier≈øey,</hi> of whom

not worthy to be recorded.</p>
               <p>It hath ten Pari≈øhes, and one Market-Towne, being al≈øo a Hauen, and is called S. <hi>Peters Port,</hi>

thereof, being a part of <hi>Che≈øhire.</hi>

            <p>(3) The Aire is healthfull and temperate, without any foggie clouds or fennie vapours, ≈øauing

            <p>(4) The Clime is ≈øomewhat colder there then in <hi>Che≈øhire,</hi> by rea≈øon of the Sea, and the Riuer
that engirts the better part of her; by which, the Northerne windes being long carried vpon the

by a young lu≈øtfull Prince or Lord of the Country, who not long able to rule his head-≈øtrong af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
hauing many times in vaine attempted and tryed her cha≈øtitie both by rich gifts and large

≈øurprized and raui≈øhed her weake (yet re≈øi≈øting) body. After the deed done, the cruell Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,

ari≈øe a Spring that continueth to this day, carrying from the Fountaine ≈øuch a forcible ≈øtreame
and current, as the like is not found in Chri≈øtendome. Ouer the head of the Spring there is built a

To this Fountaine Pilgrims are accu≈øtomed to repaire in their zealous, but blind deuotion; and
diuers others re≈øort to bathe in, holding firmely that the water is of much vertue.</p>
            <p>There be many red ≈øtones in the bottome of this Well, and much greene mo≈ø≈øe growing vpon
the ≈øides: the ≈øuper≈øtition of the people holding that tho≈øe red ≈øpots in the ≈øtones were drops of the

wall was her haire, which though ≈øome of it be giuen to euery ≈øtranger that comes, yet it neuer wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øteth.
But how≈øoeuer this be carried for truth by the tradition of time, the mo≈ø≈øe it ≈øelfe ≈ømels ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding

into the water, that ≈øo (as they thought) they might giue a more deepe and incurable blow; neuer
calling them by the names of their Parents while≈øt they liued together, but at their death tooke it
vpon them. Their women nur≈øed not the children they bare; and they that nur≈øed others, did affect
and loue them much more then their owne.</p>
            <p>(16) So much were they giuen to fanta≈øticall conceits, that they held it very ominous to giue

for as the one was mo≈øt ≈øeemely, ≈øo the other was vn≈øightly: their neckes were hung with chaines

≈øo full of pride and in≈øolency, that they flew the Con≈øtable thereof, and ≈øeized the Ca≈øtle into their

the Ca≈øtle againe, repaying the Ho≈øtages in ≈øuch ho≈øtile manner, as that they put them all to the

            <head>THE PROVINCE OF CONNAVGHT.
CHAPTER IIII.</head>
            <p>THis Prouince named by <hi>Giraldus Cambren≈øis, Conachtia,</hi> and <hi>Conacia,</hi> by the <hi>Iri≈øh, Conaughty,</hi>
and by <hi>Engli≈øh-men, Connaught:</hi> is bounded Ea≈øt-ward, with part of the County of <hi>Lein≈øter;</hi>
North-ward, with part of <hi>Vl≈øter;</hi> We≈øt-ward, with the We≈øt-maine Ocean; and on the South,
it is confined with a part of the Prouince of <hi>Moun≈øter,</hi> clo≈øed in with the Riuer <hi>Sbennon,</hi> and
butting again≈øt the Kingdome of <hi>Spaine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(2) The forme thereof is long, and towards the North and South ends, thinne and narrow;
but as it growes towards the middle, from either part it waxeth ≈øtill bigger and bigger: extending in
length from the Riuer <hi>Shennon</hi> in her South, to <hi>Enis Kelling</hi> in her North, 126. miles, and the broade≈øt
part is from <hi>Tromer</hi> in her Ea≈øt, to <hi>Barragh-Bay</hi> in her We≈øt, containing about foure≈øcore miles.
The whole in circuit and compa≈ø≈øe is aboue foure hundred miles.</p>
            <p>(3) The aire is not altogether ≈øo pure and cleare, as in the other Prouinces of <hi>Ireland,</hi> by rea≈øon
of certaine moi≈øt places (couered ouer with gra≈ø≈øe) which of their ≈øoftne≈ø≈øe are v≈øually termed
Boghes, both dangerous, and full of vaporous and foggie mi≈øts.</p>
            <p>(4) This County as it is diuided into ≈øeuerall portions, ≈øo is euery portion ≈øeuerally commended
for the ≈øoile, according to the ≈øea≈øonable times of the yeare. <hi>Twomond</hi> or the County <hi>Clare,</hi> is ≈øaid to
be a Country ≈øo conueniently ≈øituated, that either from the Sea or Soile there can be nothin wi≈øht
for more, then what it doth naturally afford of it ≈øelfe, were but the indu≈øtry of the Inhabitants an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwerable
to the re≈øt. <hi>Galway</hi> is a land very thankfull to the painefull husbandman, and no le≈ø≈øe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious
and profitable to the Shepheard. <hi>Maio,</hi> in the <hi>Roman Prouinciall</hi> called <hi>Mageo,</hi> is repleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhed
<pb facs="tcp:3363:192"/>
both with plea≈øure and fertility, abundantly rich in Cattle, Deere, Hawkes, and plenty of Hony.
<hi>Slego</hi> (coa≈øting vpon the Sea) is a plenteous Country for feeding and rai≈øing of Cattle. <hi>Le-Trim</hi> (a
place ri≈øing vp throughout with hilles) is ≈øo full of ranke gra≈ø≈øe and forrage, that (as <hi>Solinus</hi> repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth)
if Cattle were not kept ≈øometimes from gra≈øing, their fulne≈ø≈øe would endanger them. And
<hi>Ro≈øco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>en</hi> is a Territory, for the mo≈øt part plaine and fruitfull, feeding many Heards of Cattle, and
with meane husbandry and tillage, yeelding plentie of Corne, As euery particular part is thus ≈øeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
profitable by in-bred commodities; ≈øo is it no le≈ø≈øe commended (in the generalitie) for the
many accomodate and fit Bayes, Creekes, and nauigable Riuers, lying vpon her Sea-coa≈øts, that
after a ≈øort inuite and prouoke the Inhabitants to nauigation.</p>
            <p>(5) Such as in ancient time made their abode and habitations in this Prouince, were the GAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GANI,
who were al≈øo called CONCANI, AVTERI, and NAGNATAE. As the <hi>Luceni</hi> (that
were next neighbours vnto them) came from the <hi>Luceniji</hi> (in <hi>Spaine)</hi> ≈øo tho≈øe <hi>Gangam</hi> and <hi>Coneani</hi>
may ≈øeeme al≈øo to haue fetcht their deriuation from the <hi>Concan</hi> (Nation of the ≈øelfe-≈øame Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try)
both by the affinitie of name, and vicinitie of place. In <hi>Strabo,</hi> according to the diuer≈øitie of
reading, the ≈øame people are named <hi>Coniaci</hi> and <hi>Coni≈øci:</hi> and <hi>Silius</hi> te≈øtifieth them at the fir≈øt to haue
beene <hi>Scythians,</hi> and to haue v≈øed ordinarily to drinke hor≈øes bloud (a thing nothing ≈øtrange among
the wilde <hi>Iri≈øh</hi> euen of late dayes.) And ≈øome may al≈øo happily ≈øuppo≈øe that the <hi>Iri≈øh</hi> name <hi>Conaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
was compounded of <hi>Concani</hi> and <hi>Nagnatae.</hi> How≈øoeuer, it is ≈øure that the≈øe were the ancient Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of this Country, as is to be ≈øeene in <hi>Ptolemie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(6) The principall Citie of this Prouince, and which may worthily be accounted the third in
<hi>Ireland,</hi> is <hi>Galway,</hi> in <hi>Iri≈øh, Galliue,</hi> built in manner much like to a Tower. It is dignified with a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhops
See, and is much frequented with Merchants, by rea≈øon whereof, and the benefit of the Road
and Hauen, it is gainfull to the Inhabitants through traffique and exchange of rich commodities,
<pb facs="tcp:3363:193"/>
both by Sea and Iland. Not farre from which, neere the We≈øt ≈øhoare that lies indented with ≈ømall
in-lets and out lets in a row, are the Ilands called <hi>Arran,</hi> of which many a fooli≈øh fable goes, as if
they were the Ilands of the liuing, wherein none died at any time, or were ≈øubiect to moralitie;
which is as ≈øuper≈øitious an ob≈øeruation, as that v≈øed in ≈øome other corners of the Country, where
the people leaue the right armes of their Infants males vnch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that at any time afterwards, they might giue a more deadly and vngracious blow when they ≈øtrike:
which things doe not onely ≈øhew how palpably they are carried away by traditious ob≈øcurities, but
doe al≈øo intimate how full their hearts be of inueterate reuenge.</p>

their humble ≈øupplication, commanded by his mi≈ø≈øiues, that they ≈øhould be receiued vpon tearmes
<pb facs="tcp:3363:193"/>
of peace. But they being a ≈øtiffenecked people, tooke armes againe, entred a-fre≈øh into actuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
draue away booties, made foule vprores, and vpon faire promi≈øes procured the aid of the
<hi>Scotti≈øh</hi> Ilanders, from out of the <hi>Hebrides:</hi> whereupon the Gouernour a≈ø≈øembled an Armie, and
pur≈øued them with ≈øuch powerfull violence through the Woods and Forre≈øts, that after ≈øixe or ≈øea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
weekes, being grieuou≈øly hunger-bitten, they ≈øubmitted them≈øelues in all humilitie. The Auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarie

<hi>Moin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(8) About the yeare 1316. there was ≈øuch a great ≈ølaughter made of the <hi>Iri≈øh</hi> in this Prouince
of <hi>Connaught,</hi> through a quarrell that aro≈øe there betweene two Lords or Princes, that there were

Church-yards they tooke the dead bodies out of their graues, and in their ≈øculs boiled the fle≈øh, and
fed vpon it: yea, and that women did eat their owne children. Thus appeared the ire and anger of

it extends it ≈øelfe to <hi>Connagh</hi> and <hi>Lein≈øter;</hi> the Ea≈øt part lieth vpon the <hi>Iri≈øh</hi> Sea; and the We≈øt
part is continually beaten with the boi≈øterous rage of the maine We≈øt Ocean. This Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince
and furthe≈øt part of <hi>Ireland,</hi> affronteth the <hi>Scoti≈øh Ilands,</hi> which are called the <hi>Hebrides,</hi>
and are ≈øcattered in the Seas betweene both Kingdomes; who≈øe Inhabitants at this day is the <hi>Iri≈øh-Scot,</hi>
≈øucce≈ø≈øour of the old <hi>Scythian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(2) The forme thereof is round, reaching in length from <hi>Coldagh</hi>-Hauen in her North, to <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more</hi>
in her South, neere an hundred miles; and in bredth from <hi>Black-Abbey</hi> in her Ea≈øt, to <hi>Calebegh</hi>
point in her We≈øt, one hundred thirtie and odde miles: The whole in circumference, about foure
hundred and twentie miles.</p>
            <p>(3) This Country ≈øeldome feeleth any vn≈øea≈øonable extremities, the quicke and flexible windes
cooling the heat of Summer, and ≈øoft and gentle ≈øhowers mollifie the hardne≈ø≈øe of the Winter.
Briefly, the frozen nor torrid Zone haue not here any v≈øurpation; the clouds in the aire very ≈øweet
and plea≈øant, yea, and when they are mo≈øt impure, are not vnwhole≈øome, nor of long continuance,
the rough windes holding them in continuall agitation.</p>
            <p>(4) This equall temperature cau≈øeth the ground to bring forth great ≈øtore of ≈øeuerall Trees,
both fit for building, and bearing of fruit; plentifull of gra≈ø≈øe for the feeding of Cattle, and is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly
furni≈øhed with Hor≈øes, Sheepe and Oxen; the Riuers likewi≈øe pay double tribute, deepe
enough to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>arry Ve≈ø≈øels either for plea≈øure or profit, and Fi≈øh great ≈øtore, both for their owne v≈øes,
<pb facs="tcp:3363:195"/>
and commoditie of others. <hi>Salmons</hi> in ≈øome Riuers of this County abound more in number then
in any Riuer of <hi>Europe.</hi> To ≈øpeake (in generall) though in ≈øome places it be ≈øomewhat barren,
troubled with <hi>Loughes, Lakes,</hi> and thicke Woods, yet is it euery where fre≈øh, and full of Cattle and
forrage, ready at all times to an≈øwer the husbandmans paines. But nature is there ≈øo little behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to Art or Indu≈øtry, that the various ≈øhew vpon bankes, the ≈øhady groues, the greene meadowes,
hanging hilles, and fields fit for Corne, (if they were manured) doe ≈øeeme to be angry with their
Inhabitants for ≈øuffering all to grow wild and harbarous, through their owne negligence.</p>
            <p>(5) This Country in <hi>Ptolemies</hi> dayes was wholly po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed by the <hi>Volutij, Darni, Robogdji,</hi> and <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dini,</hi>
who branched and ≈øpred them≈øelues into the ≈øeuerall parts that I≈øland.</p>
            <p>(6) The people of this Prouince were accu≈øtomed in controuer≈øies and ≈øolemne prote≈øtations,
to ≈øweare by S. <hi>Patrickes Staffe,</hi> which oath they feared more to breake, then if they had ≈øworne by
the holy <hi>Euangeli≈øt<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
               </hi> Their ancient cu≈øtome in making their King, was this: A white Cow was taken,
which the King mu≈øt kill, and ≈øeeth the ≈øame in water whole, then mu≈øt he bathe him≈øelfe therein
≈øtarke naked; and ≈øitting in the Cawdron wherein it was ≈øod, accompanied with his people round
about him, he and they v≈øed to eat the fle≈øh and drinke the broath wherein he ≈øate, without cup, or
di≈øh, or v≈øe of hand. How farre the≈øe pre≈øcriptions and cu≈øtomes were different from the conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of other ciuill Monarchies, we may well perceiue by the≈øe and other like ob≈øeruations of tho≈øe
gro≈ø≈øe times, and as yet they are more barbarous then is any other part of the I≈øland be≈øides.</p>
            <p>(7) Hi≈øtorians relating of <hi>Ireland,</hi> tell of ≈øeuerall I≈ølands in the ≈øeuerall Prouinces: ≈øome full of
Angels, ≈øome full of Deuils; ≈øome for male onely, ≈øome for female; ≈øome where none may liue,
≈øome where none can die; and ≈øuch effects of trees, ≈øtones, and waters, that a man (but of ea≈øie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit)
may well e≈øteeme them as heedle≈ø≈øe as vncertaine. So al≈øo S. <hi>Patrickes</hi> Purgatorie (a thing of

maketh a poore ≈øhew) is the <hi>Archiepi≈øcopall See</hi> and <hi>Metropolitane</hi> of the whole I≈øland. Before Saint

≈øaith) by the appointment and direction of Angels, this place was named <hi>Drumfalrch;</hi> the <hi>Iri≈øh</hi> tell
much that it receiued the name of Queene <hi>Armacha:</hi> but the better opinions are, that it is the ≈øame
which <hi>Bede</hi> calleth <hi>Dearmach,</hi> and out of the <hi>Scoti≈øh</hi> and <hi>Iri≈øh</hi> language interpreteth it, <hi>The Field of
Oakes.</hi> Here (as S. <hi>Bernard</hi> writeth) S. <hi>Patricke</hi> the Apo≈øtle of <hi>Ireland</hi> ruled in his life time, and
re≈øted after death: in honor of whom it was of ≈øuch venerable e≈øtimation in old time, that not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Bi≈øhops and Prie≈øts, but Kings al≈øo and Princes were (in generall) ≈øubiect to the Metropolitane
thereof in all obedience, and to his gouernment alone. Among the Archbi≈øhops of this Prouince,
S. <hi>Malachy</hi> is famou≈øed, who fir≈øt prohibited Prie≈øts marriage in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and (as S. <hi>Bernard</hi> ≈øaith,
who wrote his life at large) borrowed no more of the natiue barbarou≈øne≈ø≈øe of that Country, then
<hi>Sea-fi≈øhes</hi> doe ≈øaltne≈ø≈øe of the Seas. Al≈øo <hi>Richard Fitz Ralf</hi> (commonly called <hi>Armachanus)</hi> is of
