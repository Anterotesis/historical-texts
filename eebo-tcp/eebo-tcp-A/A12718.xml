            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>oſiture in reſpect of <hi>Heauen, Lueretius</hi> (the firſt of the Latine Writers that names
<hi>Britaine)</hi> ſeemeth to place it in the ſame Parallel with <hi>Pontus,</hi> where he ſaith:
<q>

the rabbiſh of ſo many ages, haue of late with infinite labours and exquiſite iudgement, beene
probably reſtored and abounded; yet that no mans expectation and deſire be too much fruſtrated,
reaſon wils that we briefly ſet forth ſuch diuiſions of the Land, as many repute not ancient onely,
but authenticke.</p>
            <p>(10) Our ſeeming ancient Hiſtorians begin it at <hi>Brute,</hi> who to euery of his three ſonnes gaue a
part, called preſently after their names; as <hi>Loegria</hi> to <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

Nations of fame in this Iland, <hi>Brute</hi> ſhould haue had more ſonnes fathered on him: which conceit
ſome aſcribe to <hi>Monmouth,</hi> holding that before him it was neuer ſo diuided.</p>
            <p>(11) <hi>Ptolemie</hi> naming <hi>Britaine</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> and the <hi>Leſſe,</hi> hath beene by ſome miſtaken, as ſo diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
this Iland into two parts; but his proportion and diſtance from the <hi>Aequator,</hi> compared with
his Geographicall deſcription will euince, that he calleth this our Iland <hi>Great Britaine,</hi> and <hi>Ireland
Britaine the Leſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(12) Howbeit ſome later doe make indeed the South and more Champion to be called <hi>Great
Britaine,</hi> and the North more Mountainous, <hi>Britaine the Leſſe;</hi> whoſe Inhabitants anciently were
diſtinguiſhed into the <hi>Maiatae,</hi> and <hi>Caledonij,</hi> and now by the <hi>Scots</hi> are into <hi>Heghlandmen</hi> and <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landmen.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:3363:7"/>
But that <hi>Northerne</hi> clime being more piercing for the <hi>Romans</hi> conſtitutions, and <hi>leſſe profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
or fruitfull,</hi> they ſet their bounds not farre from <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> and altogether neglected the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
parts more Northward.</p>
            <p>(13) This neerer part of <hi>Britaine</hi> they then diuided into two parts; for the more Southerne tract,
together with <hi>Wales, Dio</hi> termeth the <hi>Higher,</hi> and that more Northward the <hi>Lower,</hi> as by the ſeate
of their Legions doth appeare; for the ſecond <hi>Legion Auguſta</hi> (which kept at <hi>Caerleon</hi> in <hi>South-Wales)</hi>
and the twentieth called <hi>Victrix</hi> (which remained at <hi>Cheſter)</hi> he placeth in the <hi>Higher Britaine:</hi> but the
ſixt <hi>Legion</hi> ſurnamed alſo <hi>Victrix,</hi> reſident at <hi>Yorke,</hi> ſerued (as he writeth) in the <hi>Lower Britain;</hi> which
diuiſion, as ſeemeth, was made by <hi>Seuerus</hi> the Emperour, who hauing vanquiſhed <hi>Albinus,</hi> Generall
of the <hi>Britaines,</hi> and reduced their State vnder his obedience, diuided the gouernment thereof into
two Prouinces, and placed two Prefects ouer the ſame.</p>
            <p>(14) After this againe the <hi>Romanes</hi> did apportion <hi>Britaine</hi> into three parts, whoſe limits our <hi>great
Antiquary</hi> aſſigneth by the ancient <hi>Archiepiſcopall</hi> Seates, grounding his coniecture on the ſaying of
Pope <hi>Lucius,</hi> who affirmes that the Eccleſiaſticall Iuriſdictions of the Chriſtians, accorded with the
precincts of the Romane Magiſtrates, &amp; that their Archbiſhops had their Sees in thoſe Cities where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
their Preſidents abode: ſo that the ancient Seates of the three Archbiſhops here, being <hi>London</hi> in
the Eaſt, <hi>Caerleon</hi> in the Weſt, and <hi>Yorke</hi> in the North; <hi>Londons</hi> Dioceſſe (as ſeemeth) made <hi>Britaine
prima; Caerleon, Britaine ſecunda;</hi> and <hi>Yorke, Maxima Caeſarienſis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(15) But in the next age, when the power of their Preſidents began to grow ouer-great, they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
diuided <hi>Britaine</hi> into fiue parts, adding the three former <hi>Valentia</hi> and <hi>Flauia Caeſarie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

firſt of which two ſeemeth to haue beene the Northerly part of <hi>Maxima Caſarie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſis,</hi> recouered from
the <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> by <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Generall, vnder <hi>Valence</hi> the Emperour, and in honour of him,
named <hi>Valentia:</hi> and <hi>Flauia</hi> may be coniectured to receiue the name from <hi>Flauius</hi> the Emperour
(ſonne of <hi>Theodoſius)</hi> for that we reade not of the name <hi>Britaine Flauia,</hi> before his time.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:3363:8"/>
(16) So theſe fiue partitions had their limits aſſigned after this manner: <hi>Britaine prima</hi> contained
thoſe coaſts that lay betwixt <hi>Thameſis,</hi> the <hi>Seuerne,</hi> and the <hi>Britiſh Sea: Britaine ſecunda</hi> extended from
<hi>Seuerne</hi> vnto the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Seas, containing the Country that we now call <hi>Wales: Flauia Caeſarienſis,</hi> was
that which lay betwixt the Riuers <hi>Humber</hi> and <hi>Tyne:</hi> and <hi>Valentia</hi> from the ſaid Riuer, and <hi>Picts wall</hi>
reached vnto the Rampire neere <hi>Edenburgh</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the fartheſt part that the <hi>Romanes</hi> poſſeſſed
when this diuiſion was in vſe. For the ſeuerall people inhabiting all thoſe parts, with their ancient
Names &amp; Borders (whether deſigned by the <hi>Romans,</hi> or the old <hi>Britaines)</hi> together with our moderne
<hi>Names</hi> and <hi>Shires,</hi> anſwerable to each of them: we will referre you to the Tables thereof elſewhere.</p>
            <p>(17) This whole Prouince of <hi>Britaine,</hi> as in our Hiſtory ſhall appeare, was highly eſteemed of the
Emperours themſelues, aſſuming as a glorious ſurname <hi>Britanicus:</hi> comming thither in perſon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
thoſe dangerous and ſcarce knowne Seas; here marrying, liuing, and dying; enacting here Lawes

him in his Triumph: and his owne Triumph of <hi>Britaine</hi> was ſet out with ſuch magnificence, that the

ſodainly into <hi>England,</hi> who in one onely battell, with the title of his ſword and ſlaughter or <hi>Herold,</hi> ſet
the Emperiall Crowne thereof vpon his owne head: which no ſooner was done, but the <hi>Engliſh</hi> went
downe, and the <hi>Normans</hi> lording it, became <hi>Owners of thoſe Cities which themſelues neuer built; poſſeſſed
thoſe Vineyards which they neuer planted; dranke of thoſe Wells which they neuer had digged; and inhabitted
thoſe houſes, filled with riches, for which they neuer had laboured:</hi> for they found it to be as <hi>the land
whereupon the Lord ſet his eye, euen from the beginning to the end of the yeare:</hi> not onely <hi>drinking water
of the raine of heauen,</hi> but hauing alſo <hi>riuers of waters and fountaines in her valleyes, and without all ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie,
whoſe ſtones are yron, and out of whoſe mountaines is digged braſſe.</hi> This made them more reſolute
at firſt to ſettle themſelues in this faireſt and fruitfulleſt part of the Iland; the Conquerour vſing all
policie both Martiall and Ciuill, to plant his poſteritie here for euer. How he found the Land go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned
we ſhewed in the <hi>Heptarchy;</hi> but his reſtleſſe thoughts were not contented with conquering

            <p>(2) Touching the diſtribution of the Kingdome, whereas other Kings before him made vſe of
it, chiefly for the good of the people, and better miniſtring of Iuſtice, he made vſe of it, to know the
wealth of his Subiects, and to enrich his Coffers: for <hi>he cauſed a deſcription to be made of all England,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:3363:9"/>
how much land euery one of his Barons poſſeſſed, how many Knights fees, how many Plow. lands, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

(yet in the Exchequer) was called <hi>Domeſday,</hi> for the generalitie of that Iudgement on all the Land:
Whereunto we may adde his other diſtribution of this Land (worſe then any former) when <hi>thruſting
the Engliſh out of their poſſeſſions, he diſtributed their inheritances to his Souldiers; yet ſo, that all ſhould be
held of the King, as of the onely true Lord and poſſeſſor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(3) For the Lawes by which he meant to gouerne, he held one excellent rule and purpoſe, which
was, that <hi>a People ought to be ruled by Lawes written and certaine:</hi> for otherwiſe new Iudges would
ſtill bring new Iudgements: and therefore he cauſed <hi>twelue to be choſen out of euery Countie, which
ſhould on their oath, without inclining one way or other, neither adding nor detracting, open vnto him all
their ancient Lawes and Cuſtomes.</hi> By whoſe relation vnderſtanding that three ſorts of Lawes former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

to the King, <hi>how grieuous it was for a Land to be iudged by thoſe Lawes which they vnderſtood not,
altered his reſolute purpoſe:</hi> yet in bringing in the ſtrange formes of <hi>Norman</hi> Proceſſe, and pleading in
the <hi>French</hi> tongue (which continued till <hi>Edward</hi> the thirds time,) that grieuance was but ſlenderly
preuented. So likewiſe did he much alter the old Courts of Iuſtice, where theſe Lawes ſhould be

CHAPTER VI.</head>
            <p>HANT-SHIRE, lying vpon the Weſt of <hi>England,</hi> Is bordered vpon the North by <hi>Bark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi>
vpon the Eaſt with <hi>Surrey</hi> and <hi>Suſſex,</hi> vpon the South with the <hi>Britiſh Seas,</hi> and <hi>Ile of
Wight,</hi> and vpon the Weſt with <hi>Dorſet</hi> and <hi>Wilt-ſhires.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(2) The length thereof from <hi>Blackwater</hi> in the North vpon <hi>Surrey,</hi> vnto <hi>Baſcomb</hi> in the
South vpon the Sea, extended in a right line, is fiftie foure Engliſh miles: and the breadth
drawne from <hi>Peters-field</hi> in the Eaſt, vnto <hi>Tidworth</hi> in the Weſt, and confines of <hi>Wilt-ſhire,</hi> is little
leſſe then thirtie miles, the whole Circumference about one hundred fiftie and fiue miles.</p>
            <p>(3) The Aire is temperate, though ſomewhat thicke by reaſon of the Seas, and the many Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
that thorow the Shire doe fall, whoſe plentie of fiſh and fruitfull increaſe, doe manifoldly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme
the harmes which they make.</p>
            <p>(4) The Soile is rich for Corne and Cattle, pleaſant for paſturage, and plenteous for woods;
in a word, in all commodities either for Sea or Land, bleſſed and happy.</p>
            <p>(5) Hauens it hath, and thoſe commodious both to let in, and to looſe out Ships of great bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
in trade of Merchandiſe, or other imployments: whereof <hi>Portſmouth, Tichfield, Hamble,</hi> and
<hi>South-hampton</hi> are chiefe: beſides many other creeks that open their boſomes into thoſe Seas, and
the Coaſt ſtrengthned with many ſtrong Caſtles, ſuch as <hi>Hurſt, Calſhot, South-hampton, S. Andrewes,
Worth, Porcheſter,</hi> and the South Caſtle, beſides other Bulwarkes, or Blockhouſes that ſecure the
Country: and further in the Land, as <hi>Malwood, Wincheſter,</hi> and <hi>Odiam,</hi> ſo ſtrong, that in the time of
King <hi>Iohn,</hi> thirteene <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> onely defended the Fort for fifteene dayes againſt <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>France,</hi>
that with a great Hoſt aſſaulted it moſt hotly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:3363:26"/>
(6) Anciently it was poſſeſt vpon the North by the <hi>Segontians,</hi> who yeelded themſelues to <hi>Iulius
Caeſar,</hi> and whoſe chiefe Citie was <hi>Vindonum, Caer Segonte,</hi> now <hi>Silceſter;</hi> and vpon the South by the
<hi>Belga,</hi> and <hi>Regni,</hi> who were ſubdued by <hi>Plauſius</hi> and <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> the <hi>Romans,</hi> where <hi>Titus</hi> reſcuing his
Father, ſtraitly beſieged by the <hi>Britaines,</hi> as <hi>Dio</hi> and <hi>Forcatulus</hi> doe report, was graſped about with
an Adder, but no hurt to his perſon, and therefore taken for a ſigne of good lucke. Their chiefe
Towne was <hi>Rincewood,</hi> as yet ſounding the name: and more within Land inhabited the <hi>Manures,</hi> as

<hi>Henry</hi> as <hi>Abſalom</hi> hanged by a bough, came to their vntimely ends At ſo deare a rate the pleaſures
of dogs, and harbour for beaſts were bought in the bloud of theſe Princes.</p>
            <p>(8) The generall commodities gotten in this Shire, are Woolls, Clothes, and Iron, whereof

CHAPTER VIII.</head>
            <p>DORCESTER, from her ancient people DVROTRIGES, is moſt likely to haue receiued
that name: by the <hi>Britaines</hi> called DVVRGVVEIR, lyeth bounded vpon the North-ſide

vpon the Eaſt altogether with <hi>Hampſhire:</hi> and her South part is wholly bounded with the
<hi>Britiſh Seas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(2) The forme growes wider from the Weſt, and ſpreads her ſelfe the broadeſt in the midſt,
where it extends to twentie-foure miles, but in length is no leſſe then fortie-foure: the whole in
Circumference about, is one hundred and fiftie miles.</p>
            <p>(3) The ayre is good, and of an healthfull conſtitution: the ſoyle is fat, affording many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities,
and the Countrey moſt pleaſant in her ſituation: for the In-land is watered with many
ſweet and freſh running Springs, which taking paſſage thorow the plaine Vallies, doe laſtly in a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
manner vnite themſelues together, and of their many branches make many bigge bodied
ſtreames: neither doth the Sea deny them entrance, but helpeth rather to fill vp their Bankes,
whereby Veſſels of burden diſcharge their rich Treaſures, and her ſelfe with open hand diſtributeth
her gifts all along the South of this Shore.</p>
            <p>(4) Anciently it was poſſeſt by the <hi>Durotriges,</hi> whom <hi>Ptolemie</hi> placeth along in this Tract, who
being ſubdued by the <hi>Romans,</hi> yeelded them roome, and vnwilling ſubiection. After them the <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>

a ſmall power obtained a great victory, cauſing their King <hi>Canute</hi> with diſcourage to retire.</p>
            <p>(5) Commodities ariſing in this Countie are chiefly <hi>Wools</hi> and <hi>Woods</hi> in her North, where the

It tooke the name of <hi>Sommerton</hi> (ſometime the chiefe Towne of this Shire) whence in the
ancient Hiſtorian <hi>Aſſerius,</hi> this Countie is called <hi>Sommertunenſis,</hi> that is, <hi>Sommertun-ſhire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(2) The forme thereof is large, bearing it ſelfe ſtill wider as it ſtretcheth into the middle part
thereof, and containes in length from <hi>Brackley</hi> neere vnto <hi>Frome-Selwood</hi> Eaſtward, to <hi>Oure</hi> in the
Weſt, Miles 55. In breadth from <hi>Porſhut point</hi> in the North, to <hi>Chard</hi> Southward, is ſomewhat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
fortie miles. The whole circumference is about 204. miles.</p>
            <p>(3) The ayre is milde and pleaſing, and for the moſt part ſubiect to ſuch temperate diſpoſitions
as the Sommer-ſeaſon affordeth, whence ſome haue erroniouſly conceited, that the Region borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her name from the nature of her Clime: yet how delightefull ſo euer it is in the time of Sommer,
with change of the ſeaſon it may well change her pleaſing name, and borrow ſome Winterly deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination;
ſo full of wet, ſo myrie and mooriſh it is; in ſo much as the Inhabitants can hardly tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
to and fro without their great encumbrance.</p>
            <p>(4) Howbeit they paſſe ouer this with all patience, knowing their enſuing ſeaſonable profits
farre to exceede any preſent detriments and diſpleaſures: for as it is foule, ſo it is fruitfull, which
makes them comfort themſelues with this Prouerbe, that <hi>What is worſt for the Rider, is beſt for the
Abider:</hi> the Soyle and Globe thereof being very fertile, and euery ſide garniſhed with Paſtures and
<pb facs="tcp:3363:40"/>
delightfull Meadowes, and beautified with Mannor houſes both many and fayre; and (in a word)
hath euery thing in it to content the purſe, the heart, the eye, at home: and ſufficient Ports to giue
entertainment to commodities from abroad.</p>
            <p>(5) The ancient Inhabitants that poſſeſſed this Prouince were the <hi>Belgae,</hi> who ſpread themſelues
farre and wide, as well here as in <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> and the inner parts of <hi>Hamſhire:</hi> who being branched
from the <hi>Germans,</hi> conferred the names of thoſe places from whence they came, vpon theſe their
ſeats where they reſided.</p>
            <p>(6) The generall profits of this Prouince are Corne and Cattle, wherewith it is ſo plentifully
ſtored, as it may challenge any neighbouring Country for the quantitie to make ſhew of Cattle ſo
fat, or Graine ſo rich. Some places are peculiarly enriched by Lead-mines, as <hi>Mindiphiis,</hi> (perchance
ſo called of the deepe Mynes) by <hi>Leiland</hi> aptly tearmed <hi>Minerarij, Minerall-hils,</hi> which yeeld plenty
of Lead, the moſt Merchantable Commoditie that is in <hi>England,</hi> and vented into all parts of the
world Some are beautified with Diamons, as S <hi>Vincent Rocke,</hi> whereof there is great plentie, and
ſo bright of colour, as they might equalize <hi>Indian</hi> Diamonds, if they had their hardneſſe yet being
ſo many and ſo common, they are leſſe ſought after or commended</p>

            <p>SVFFOLKE, in regard of them which were ſeated in <hi>Norfolke,</hi> is a Country moſt plenteous and
pleaſant for habitation. It is ſeparated from <hi>Norfolke,</hi> by the Riuers of the leſſer <hi>Ouſe,</hi> and <hi>Waue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi>
whoſe heads meet almoſt in the midſt of her Verge, and that very neere together: the one
taking courſe <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and the other full <hi>Weſt,</hi> vpon which part <hi>Cambridge-ſhire</hi> doth wholly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front.
The South ſide is ſeuered by <hi>Stoure</hi> from <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and the Eaſt together waſhed with the

            </p>
            <p>(2) The Ayre is good, ſweet, and delectable, and in ſome parts, of ſome of our beſt Phyſitians,
held to be the beſt in the Land: the Soile is rich, fruitfull, and with all things well repleniſhed; in a
word, nothing wanting for pleaſure of profit.</p>
            <p>(3) The forme thereof is ſome what <hi>Creſſant,</hi> ſhooting vp narrower into the <hi>North,</hi> and ſpreading
wider towards the <hi>South,</hi> whoſe broadeſt part is about twentie miles: but from Eaſt to Weſt much

then Slaues, and their Queene whipped in moſt ignominious manner; vnder <hi>Boduo</hi> they wrought
their reuenge, as in the Hiſtory (Chriſt aſſiſting) ſhall be further related.</p>
            <p>Next to theſe <hi>Icenians,</hi> were the <hi>Saxons</hi> that got their footing into theſe parts, and of them, this

            <p>The Name ariſeth from the ſituation of the people, who being the Norther-moſt of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

that each of them maintaine other, and are the chiefeſt wealth of our Country. The <hi>Woodland</hi> (fitter

were together erected into a Kingdome by <hi>Vffa,</hi> of whom the ſucceeding Kings were tituled <hi>Vffines.</hi>
But hauing ſuffred many Tempeſts of <hi>Fortune,</hi> it was in the yeare 870. vtterly waſted and extinct by
<hi>Hungar</hi> and <hi>Hubba</hi> the <hi>Danes,</hi> who ouerthrew the vertuous King <hi>Edmund</hi> about <hi>Thetford,</hi> and after
martyred him at S. <hi>Edmundsbury.</hi> Yet they did not long enioy it: for King <hi>Edward</hi> ſhortly recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

in theſe parts, ſo that many of our Townes were founded by them, and a great part of
our people and Gentry are riſen out of their bloud.</p>
            <p>(4) This Kingdome of <hi>Eaſt-Angles</hi> was after allotted to an Earledome of that name by <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am
the Conquerour,</hi> who made <hi>Radulph</hi> a <hi>Britaine,</hi> marying his kinſwoman, Earle thereof; but gaue

<hi>W. de Albany, Pincernae,</hi> and <hi>W de Warranna Forreſtario,</hi> who to ſtrengthen themſelues (according to
the vſe of that time) with the homage and ſeruice of many tenants, diuided large portions of the

were in thoſe dayes either mediately or immediately holden of one of them. And as <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke</hi>

CHAPTER XVIII.</head>
            <p>CAMBRIDGE-SHIRE, lyeth bounded vpon the North with <hi>Lincolneſhire</hi> and <hi>Northfolke;</hi>
vpon the Eaſt with <hi>Norfolke</hi> and <hi>Suffolke;</hi> vpon the South with <hi>Hartford-ſhire</hi> and <hi>Eſſex;</hi> and
vpon the Weſt with <hi>Bedford</hi> and <hi>Huntington ſhires.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(2) This Prouince is not large, nor for ayre greatly to be liked, hauing the Fennes ſo
ſpread vpon her North, that they infect the ayre far into the reſt: From whoſe furtheſt point
vnto <hi>Royſton</hi> in the South, are thirtie-fiue miles; but in the broadeſt is not fully twentie: the whole
in Circumference, traced by the compaſſe of her many indents, one hundred twentie and eight
miles.</p>
            <p>(3) The Soile doth differ both in ayre and commodities; the Fenny ſurcharged with waters:
the South is Champion, and yeeldeth <hi>Corne</hi> in abundance, with <hi>Meadowing. Paſtures</hi> vpon both the
ſides of the Riuer <hi>Came,</hi> which diuides that part of the Shire in the midſt, vpon whoſe <hi>Eaſt-bancks</hi>
the <hi>Muſes</hi> haue built their moſt ſacred <hi>Seat,</hi> where with plenteous increaſe they haue continued for
theſe many hundred yeares.</p>
            <p>(4) For from ancient <hi>Grantceſter, Camboritum</hi> by <hi>Antonine,</hi> now famous <hi>Cambridge,</hi> the other
breſt and <hi>Nurſe-mother</hi> of all pious literature, haue flowed full ſteames of the learned <hi>Sciences</hi> into
all other parts of this Land, and elſe-where: ancient indeed, if their <hi>Story</hi> be rightly writ, that will
haue it built by <hi>Cantaber</hi> a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> three hundred ſeauenty fiue yeares before the birth of our <hi>Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,</hi>
who thither firſt brought and planted the <hi>Muſes.</hi> This Citie <hi>Grantceſter</hi> by the tyranny of time
loſt both her owne beautie and her profeſſed <hi>Athenian Students,</hi> ſo that in <hi>Bedaes</hi> dayes, ſeauen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
yeares after the Word became fleſh, it is deſcribed to lye a little deſolate Citie, and as yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth
the name, without any memory of circuit by wals.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:3363:60"/>
Of this Citie, in the yeare of <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> 141. as the Monke of <hi>Barton</hi> doth report, nine Scholars
receiued their <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> and became Preachers of the Goſpell among the <hi>Britaines;</hi> which (as he
ſaith)
happened in the Raigne of <hi>Hadriant</hi> the Emperour. But when the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

had laid all things waſte, and with their ſauage ſwords cut out the leaues of all ciuill learning,
this as the reſt yeelded to deſtruction, and ſo lay forlorne till the <hi>Saxons</hi> themſelues became likewiſe
ciuill; when <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

he had beene baniſhed, built <hi>Schooies</hi> in his Kingdome, and here at <hi>Granceſter</hi> the chiefe, recalling
thither the Profeſſors of <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences,</hi> as the Story recordeth, and Traditions doe hold.</p>
            <p>But afterwards, as it ſeemeth, their increaſe being ſtraightned, the <hi>Students</hi> complained (as the
Prophets did to <hi>Eliſha)</hi> that the place was too little for them to dwell in, therefore inlarging more
North-ward, ſeated themſelues neere vnto the <hi>Bridge,</hi> whereupon the place began to be called <hi>Grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi>
though others from the crooked Riuer <hi>Came</hi> will haue it named <hi>Cambridge.</hi> This place
(though ſacred and exempted from <hi>Mars,</hi> as <hi>Sylla</hi> once ſpake; when he ſpared <hi>Athens,)</hi> the <hi>Danes</hi>
in their deſtructions regarded no whit, wherein they often wintered after their ſpoyles, and left the
ſcatres of their ſauage ſores euer behinde them. And in the yeare 1010 when <hi>Suen</hi> in his fierceneſſe
bare downe all before him, this place was no place for <hi>Scholars</hi> to be in: <hi>Warres</hi> loud <hi>Alarums</hi> ill
conſorting the <hi>Muſes</hi> milde Harmonies. Yet when the <hi>Normans</hi> had got the <hi>Garland</hi> on their heads,
and theſe <hi>Daniſh ſtormes</hi> turned into <hi>Sun-ſhine dayes, Giſlebert</hi> the <hi>Monke,</hi> with <hi>Odo, Terricus,</hi> and <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam,</hi>
all three of the like <hi>Monaſticall Profeſsion,</hi> in the Raigne of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Firſt, reſorted vnto
this place, and in a publike <hi>Barne</hi> read the <hi>Lectures</hi> of <hi>Grammar, Logicke,</hi> and <hi>Rhetoricke,</hi> and <hi>Giſlebert
Diuinitie</hi> vpon the Sabbath and Feſtiuall dayes. <hi>From this little fountaine</hi> (ſaith <hi>Peter Bleſſenſis) grew
a great Riuer, which made all</hi> England <hi>fruitfull, by the many Maſters &amp; Teachers proceeding out of</hi> Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,
<hi>as out of a holy Paradiſe of God.</hi> The firſt <hi>Colledge</hi> therein endowed with Poſſeſſions was <hi>Peter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:3363:61"/>
built by <hi>Hugh Balſham</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> in the yeare of Grace, 1284. whoſe godly example many
others followed, ſo that at this day there are ſixteene moſt ſtately <hi>Colledges</hi> and <hi>Hals,</hi> for building,

the like are not found in all <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But at what time it was made an <hi>Vniuerſitie,</hi> let <hi>Robert de Remyngton</hi> tell you for me. <hi>Do the Raigne</hi>
(ſaith he) <hi>of King</hi> Edward <hi>the firſt, Grantbridge, of a Schoole, by the Court of Rome, was made an Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie,

            <p>(5) Another Citie formerly in great fame is <hi>Elie,</hi> had in account for the repute and holineſſe of
<hi>Votary Nunnes</hi> there reſiding; built firſt by <hi>Audrey</hi> wife to one <hi>Tombret</hi> a <hi>Prince</hi> in this <hi>Prouince,</hi>
who had this place as a part of her Dowry: ſhe hauing departed from her ſecond Husband <hi>Egbert</hi>
King of <hi>Northumberland</hi> deuoted her ſelfe to the ſeruice of God, and built here a <hi>Monaſtery,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

the iuriſdiction ouer foure Hundreds and a halfe, within theſe Fennes and the <hi>Eaſt-Angles</hi> limits,
which to this day are called <hi>The Liberties of S. Audrey,</hi> after whoſe example many <hi>Nobles</hi> ſo enriched
it with large <hi>Renexewes,</hi> that as <hi>Malmesbury</hi> ſaith, <hi>the Abbat thereof laid vp yeerely in his owne Coffers
a thouſand and foure hundred pounds</hi> And of latter times the <hi>Monkes</hi> thereof became ſo wealthy, that
their old decayed Church they renued with new and moſt ſtately buildings, which is now the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrall</hi>
of the <hi>Dioceſſe,</hi> and for beautie giueth place to no other in the Land Eight other foundations

doth abundantly grow, as alſo <hi>Saffron,</hi> a very rich Spice. Some <hi>Woods</hi> there are, and <hi>Paſture</hi> both
pleaſant and profitable. The North part thereof is Fenny, but withall fruitfull, whereof <hi>Henry</hi> of

CHAPTER XX.</head>
            <p>BEDFORD-SHIRE, ſeated in the South-Eaſt of this <hi>Iland,</hi> is a plaine and champion Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and lyeth bounded vpon the North with <hi>Huntington-ſhire;</hi> vpon the Eaſt with <hi>Cambridge</hi>
and <hi>Hartford-ſhires;</hi> vpon the South with <hi>Hartford</hi> and <hi>Buckingham-ſhires;</hi> and vpon the Weſt
with <hi>Buckingham</hi> and <hi>Northampton-ſhires.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(2) The forme thereof is ſomwhat ouall, and not very large: for from <hi>Tilbroke</hi> in the North,
vnto <hi>Stu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

<hi>Hatley Coking</hi> in the Eaſt, are not fully foureteene; the whole in Circumference, about ſeauenty three
miles.</p>
            <p>(3) The Ayre is temperate, and the Soile bounteous, eſpecially the North, whoſe Borders the
fruitfull <hi>Ouſe</hi> with her many windings watereth. The South is more leane, and with greater indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry
bringeth forth <hi>Barley,</hi> no better elſe-where. Generally, this County is Champion, though ſome
places be ſprinkled with Paſturage and Woods.</p>
            <p>(4) The ancient Inhabitants knowne to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> that held in this Shire, were part of the
<hi>Cattieuchlani,</hi> a ſtout and warre-ſtrring people: and yet vpon the report of <hi>Caeſars</hi> proceeding, ſent
him their ſubiection for peace. But when that conquering Nation had brought <hi>Britaine</hi> into a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince</hi>
vnder <hi>Rome,</hi> their Legions lay at <hi>Selenae</hi> and <hi>Magintum,</hi> which are now <hi>Sandy</hi> and <hi>Dunſtable,</hi>
places of memorable note in this Shire. After them the <hi>Saxons</hi> coueting for ſo faire a Seate, firſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed
the <hi>Britaines,</hi> vnder the leading of <hi>Cuthwulfe</hi> the <hi>Weſt-Saxon,</hi> about the yeare of Grace 572.
who making it their owne, was laſtly enioyed by the <hi>Mercians,</hi> as a part of their Kingdome.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:3363:65"/>
(5) In the yeare of Chriſts Incarnation 1399 immediately before thoſe <hi>Ciuill Warres,</hi> that rent
in pieces the peace of this Land, betweene the Princes of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> and <hi>Yorke,</hi> the Riuer <hi>Ouſe</hi> neere
vnto <hi>Harwood,</hi> ſtood ſodainly ſtill, and refrained to paſſe any farther; ſo that forward, men paſſed
three miles together on foot in the very depth of her Channell; and backward, the waters ſwelled
vnto a great height: which was obſerued by the judicious, to foretell ſome vnkinde diuiſion that
ſhortly ſhould ariſe.</p>
            <p>(6) This Countie, among the common calamities of the Land, when it lay trampied vnder the
fect of the <hi>Danes,</hi> ſuſtained a part: and after that, in the time of King <hi>Stephen,</hi> when the <hi>Ciuill Warres</hi>
thundred betwixt <hi>Maud</hi> the <hi>Empreſſe</hi> and himſelfe, the Shire-Towne was ſore waſted, with great
ſlaughter of men: So when the <hi>Barons</hi> forſooke their allegeance to King <hi>Iohn,</hi> the Towne and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
were rendred vp vnto their hands: and laſtly, by King <hi>Henry</hi> the third, laid leuell euen with the
ground, ſome ruinous walles appearing towards the <hi>Ouſe,</hi> but not a ſtone left vpon the <hi>Mount</hi> where
ſtood his foundation.</p>
            <p>(7) This Towne by the <hi>Britaines</hi> was called <hi>Lettidur;</hi> and of vs, <hi>Bedford:</hi> being the chiefeſt in
the Countie, from whom it taketh the name, and is moſt fruitfull, and pleaſantly ſeated, hauing the
<hi>Ouſe</hi> running thorow the Towne in the middeſt, and a faire <hi>Stone-bridge</hi> built ouer the ſame, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
are two Gates to locke and impeach the paſſage, as occaſion ſhall ſerue. At the firſt entrance
ſtandeth S. <hi>Leonards Hoſpitall</hi> for <hi>Lazars:</hi> and further inwards, S. <hi>Iohns</hi> and S. <hi>Maries</hi> Churches:
within the Towne, S. <hi>Pauls,</hi> a moſt beautifull Church, S. <hi>Cuthberis,</hi> and S. <hi>Peters:</hi> without the
Towne ſtandeth the <hi>Fryers,</hi> S. <hi>Loyes, Alhallowes,</hi> and <hi>Caudwell Abbey:</hi> not farre whence ſometimes
ſtood a Chappell vpon the Banke of <hi>Ouſe,</hi> wherein (as <hi>Florilegus</hi> affirmeth) the body of <hi>Offa</hi> the
great <hi>Mercian</hi> King was interred, but by the ouer-ſwelling of that Riuer, was borne downe, and
ſwallowed vp; whoſe Tombe of Lead (as it were ſome phantaſticall thing) appeared often to them
<pb facs="tcp:3363:65"/>
that ſeeke it not, but to them that ſeeke it (ſaith <hi>Roſſe)</hi> it is inuiſible. This Towne is gouerned
yearely by a <hi>Mator,</hi> two <hi>Bailiffes,</hi> two <hi>Chamberlaines,</hi> a <hi>Recorder,</hi> a <hi>towne-Clerke,</hi> and three <hi>Sergeants</hi>
with <hi>Maſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(8) A tale of vaine credit is reported of <hi>Dunſtable,</hi> that it was built to bridle the outragiouſneſſe
of a theefe named <hi>Dun,</hi> by King <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt: but certaine it is the place was formerly held by the
<hi>Romanes,</hi> whoſe <hi>Legions</hi> there lay, as appeareth by the Coines there vſually found, which from <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gmium</hi>
are corruptly called <hi>Madning-money.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(9) Caſtles in this Shire are <hi>Woodhill, Eaton, Temſford,</hi> and <hi>Amphill,</hi> an honour now appertaining
to the Crowne. And places of <hi>Religion,</hi> built by deuout perſons, but for <hi>Idolatrous Abuſes</hi> againe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed,
were at <hi>Bedford, Harwood, Helenflow, Newenham, Chickſand, Wardon, Woborne,</hi> and <hi>Dunſtable.</hi>
All theſe, with their like, felt the hand of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight to lie ſo heauie vpon them, that they were
not able to ſuſtaine the waight, but were cruſhed to peices, and fell to the ground.</p>
            <p>(10) The Graduation of this Countie, taken for the Shire-Towne, is placed from the <hi>Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi>

            <p>(5) The Shire-Towne <hi>Buckingham,</hi> fruitfully ſeated vpon the Riuer <hi>Ouſe,</hi> was fortified with a

CHAPTER XXIII.</head>
            <p>GLOCESTER-SHIRE, lyeth bordered vpon the North with <hi>Worceſter</hi> and <hi>Warwicke-ſhires,</hi>
vpon the Eaſt with <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Wileſhire;</hi> vpon the South altogether with <hi>Sommerſet-ſhire:</hi>
and vpon the Weſt with the Riuer <hi>Wye</hi> and <hi>Hereford-ſhire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(2) The length thereof extended from <hi>Briſtow</hi> vpon the Riuer <hi>Auon</hi> in her South, vnto
<hi>Clifford</hi> vpon another <hi>Auon</hi> in her North, are about fortie eight miles; and her broadeſt part
from Eaſt to Weſt, is from <hi>Lechlad</hi> vnto <hi>Preſton,</hi> containing twentie eight: the whole circumference
about one hundred thirtie eight miles.</p>
            <p>(3) <hi>The forme whereof is ſomewhat long and narrow: the Ayre thereof is pleaſant, ſweet and
delectable: and for fruitfulneſſe of Soile heare</hi> Malmesbury <hi>and not me:</hi> The ground of this Shire
throughout <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> yeeldeth plentie of Corne, and bringeth forth abundance of fruits; the one through
the naturall goodneſſe onely of the ground, the other through the diligent manuring and tillage, in ſuch wiſe,
that it would prouoke the lazieſt perſon to take paines Here you may ſee the High-wayes and Common Lanes
clad with Apple trees and Peare trees, not ingrafted by the induſtry of mans hand, but growing naturally of
their owne accord: the ground of it ſelfe is ſo inclined to beare fruits, and thoſe both in taſte and beautie farre
exceeding others, and will endure vntill a new ſupply come. There is not any Country in <hi>England</hi> ſo thicke
ſet with Vineyards as this Prouince is, ſo plentifull of increaſe, and ſo pleaſant in taſte. The very wines made
thereof carry no vnpleaſant tartneſſe, as being little inferiour in ſweet verdure to the French wines; the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
are innumerable, the Churches paſsing faire, and the Townes ſtanding very thicke. But that which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth

Channell broader, for Streame ſwifter, or for Fiſh better ſtored. There is in it a daily rage and fury of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,

vpon the face of her bordering grounds, and againe retyreth as a Conquerour into the vſuall Channell. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
is the Veſſell which it taketh full vpon the ſide: but the Water-men well ware thereof, when they ſee
that Hydra comming, turne the Veſſell vpon it, and cut thorow the midſt of it, whereby they checke and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyd

            <p>(4) The ancient people that poſſeſſed this Prouince, were the DOBVNI, who ſpread them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
further into <hi>Oxford ſhire.</hi> But betwixt the <hi>Seuerne</hi> and <hi>Wye</hi> were ſeated part of SILVRES,

in ſome part of this Shire enioy a priuate cuſtome to this day, that the Goods and Lands
of <hi>Condemned Perſons</hi> fall vnto the Crowne but onely for a yeare and a day, and then returne to the

CHAPTER XXIIII.</head>
            <p>HEREFORD-SHIRE, (formerly accounted within the limits of <hi>Wales)</hi> lyeth circulated

            </p>
            <p>(2) This Counties Climate is moſt healthfull and temperate, and Soyle ſo fertile for Corne
and Cattle, that no place in <hi>England</hi> yeeldeth more or better conditioned: ſweet Riuers running as
veynes in the body, doe make the Corne bearing grounds in ſome of her parts rightly to be tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

ſuch are <hi>Lemſter, Irchenfeild,</hi> the bankes of <hi>Wye, Luge,</hi> and <hi>Frome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(3) The ancient people knowne to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> (whoſe power they well felt before they could
ſubdue them) were the <hi>Silures,</hi> placed by <hi>Ptolemie</hi> in this tract, and branched further into <hi>Radnor,

Their Originall, as <hi>Tacitus</hi> coniectureth by their ſite, coloured countenances and curled

of ſeruitude, which well they ſhewed vnder <hi>Cara<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

the <hi>Roman</hi> aſſaulters, for whoſe onely Conqueſt (and that made by treachery) the Victor in <hi>Rome</hi>
triumphed with more then a vſuall Aſpect; and with ſo equall an hand bare the Scoale of Reſiſtance,
that their owne Writers euermore terme it a dangerous Warre. For the Legion of <hi>Marius Valens</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:3363:75"/>
they put to flight, and that with ſuch hauock of the Aſſociates, that <hi>Oſterius</hi> the Lieutenant of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine</hi>
for very griefe gaue vp his ghoſt: and <hi>Veranius</hi> vnder <hi>Nero</hi> aſſaulted them in vaine. But when
<hi>Veſpaſian</hi> was <hi>Emperour,</hi> and expert Souldiers imployed in euery Prouince, <hi>Iulius Frontinus</hi> ſubdued
theſe <hi>Silures</hi> vnto the <hi>Romans,</hi> where continually ſome of their Legions afterward kept, till all was
abandoned in <hi>Valentinians</hi> time.</p>
            <p>(4) The <hi>Saxons</hi> then made themſelues Lords of this Land, and this Prouince a part of their
<hi>Mercians</hi> Kingdome; yea, and <hi>Sutton</hi> the Court of great <hi>Offa</hi> their King.</p>
            <p>(5) But <hi>Hereford</hi> after, raiſed of the ruines of old <hi>Ariconium</hi> (now <hi>Kencheſter,</hi> ſhaken in pieces
by a violent Earth quake) grew to great fame, through a conceiued ſanctity by the buriall of <hi>Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi>
King of the <hi>Eaſt-Angles,</hi> ſlaine at <hi>Sutton</hi> by <hi>Offa,</hi> at what time he came thither to haue eſpouſed to
his Daughter; whoſe graue was firſt made at <hi>Marden,</hi> but afterwards canonized and remoued to
this Citie, when in honour of him was built the Cathedrall Church by <hi>Milfrid,</hi> a pettie King of
that Country, which <hi>Gruffith</hi> Prince of <hi>South-Wales,</hi> and <hi>Algar</hi> an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> rebelling againſt
King <hi>Edward Confeſſor,</hi> conſumed with fire; but by Biſhop <hi>Remeſiu</hi> was reſtored at now it is, at what
time the Towne was walled, and is ſo remaining in good repaire, hauing ſixe Gates for entrance,
and fifteen Watch-towers for defence, extending in compaſſe to fifteen hundred paces: and whence
the <hi>North-Pole</hi> is obſerued to be raiſed 52. degrees, 17. minutes in Latitude, and is ſet from the firſt
point of the <hi>Weſt</hi> in Longitude, 17. degrees and 30. minutes; being yearely gouerned by a Maior,
choſen out of one and thirtie Citizens, which are commonly called the Election, and he euer after
is knowne for an Alderman, and clothed in Scarlet, whereof foure of the eldeſt are Iuſtices of Peace,
graced with a Sword-bearer, a Recorder, a Towne-Clerke, and foure Sergeants with Mace.</p>
            <p>The greateſt glory that this Citie receiued, was in King <hi>Athelſtans</hi> dayes; where (as <hi>Malmesbury</hi>
doth report) he cauſed the Lords of <hi>Wales</hi> by way of Tribute, to pay yearely (beſides Hawkes and
<pb facs="tcp:3363:76"/>
Hounds) twenty pound of Gold, and three hundred pound of Siluer by waight; but how that was
performed and continued I finde not.</p>
            <p>(6) Things of rare note in this Shire are ſaid to be, <hi>Bone well,</hi> a Spring not farre from <hi>Richards
Caſtle,</hi> wherein are continually found little Fiſhes bones, but not a ſinne ſeene; and being wholly

            <p>(3) The Ayre in this Shire is of a fauourable temperature, that giues an appetite for labour, diet,

abundance of Corne in euery place ſpread, the Woods and Paſturage in her hils and plaines, ſweet
Riuers that water the vallies below, and Cattle that couer the tops of higher ground; the Fields,
Hedge-rowes, and High-wayes are beſet with fruitfull Peare-trees, that yeeld great pleaſure to ſight,

This Citie by <hi>Hardy Canute</hi> in the yeare of Chriſt 1041. was ſorely endangered, and ſet on fire, and
the Citizens ſlaine almoſt euery one, for that they had killed his Collector of the <hi>Daniſh Tribute:</hi>
yet it was preſently repaired and peopled, <hi>with many Burgeſſes. and for fifteene Hides diſcharged it ſelfe
to the Conquerour;</hi> as in his <hi>Doomeſdayes</hi> is to be ſeene. But in the yeare 1113. a ſodaine fire happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,

            </p>
            <p>(2) The forme of this Countie is large and narrow, broadeſt in the South-weſt; and thence
ſhooting ſtill leſſer like vnto a Horne, nor not much vnlike to the forme of <hi>Cornwall:</hi> and from the
entrance of <hi>Cherwell</hi> into this Shire, vnto the fall of <hi>Weland</hi> and <hi>Nene</hi> neere vnto <hi>Crowland,</hi> are by

            </p>
            <p>(3) The aire is good, temperate, and healthfull: the ſoile is champion, rich, and fruitfull, and

at one view may be ſeene: notwithſtanding the ſimple and gentle ſheepe, of all creatures the
moſt harmeleſſe, are now become ſo rauenous, that they begin to deuoure men, waſte fields, and
depopulate houſes, if not whole Towne-ſhips, as one merily hath written.</p>
            <p>(4) The antient people knowne to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and recorded by <hi>Ptolemie,</hi> were the <hi>Coritani,</hi> who
poſſeſſed this Country, and were branched further thorow <hi>Leiceſter, Lincolne, Nottingham, Rutland,</hi>
and <hi>Darbie-ſhires:</hi> theſe ioyning with the <hi>Irenians,</hi> with them were fettered with the chaines of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection,
when for <hi>Claudius, Publius Oſtrius Scapula</hi> entred his Lieutenantſhip in <hi>Britaine,</hi> and in

battle ſubdued all betwixt the Riuers <hi>Nene</hi> and <hi>Sabrina.</hi> But when the <hi>Romans</hi> were content to let
goe that which ſo long was deſired, and had coſt ſo much in the getting, the <hi>Saxons,</hi> a moſt warlike
Nation put into theſe parts, and made it a portion of their <hi>Mercian Kingdome:</hi> but their gouernment
alſo growne out of date, the <hi>Normans</hi> ſeated themſelues in theſe faire poſſeſſions, the branches of
whole Stemmes are ſpread abroad in theſe parts, moſt fruitfull and faire.</p>
            <p>(5) Commodities ariſing in this Shire, are chiefly gotten by tillage and plough, whereby corne
ſo plentifully aboundeth, that in no other Countie is found more, or ſo much: the paſtures and
woods are filled with Cattle, and euery where ſheepe loaden with their fleeces of wooll.</p>
            <p>(6) The chiefe Towne in this Shire is <hi>Northampton,</hi> whereof the Countie taketh name, which
for circuit, beautie, and building, may be ranked with the moſt of the Cities of our Land. It is ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
at the meeting and confluence of two Riuers, the greater whereof beareth to name <hi>Nen.</hi> This
Towne hath beene built all of ſtone, as by many foundations remaining to this day is ſeene, and is
walled about both ſtrong and high, excepting the Weſt, which is defended by a Riuer parted into
many ſtreames. In the depredations of the <hi>Danes, Suen</hi> their King ſet this Towne on fire, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
it was ſorely aſſulted by the diſobedient <hi>Barons</hi> of King <hi>Iohn,</hi> who named themſelues, <hi>The

whence the <hi>Barons</hi> with diſplayed Banners ſounded the Battle againſt their Soueraigne. And yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this a woefull Field of <hi>Englands</hi> ciuill diuiſion was fought, whence <hi>Richard Neuil</hi> the ſtout Earle
of <hi>Warwicke,</hi> lead away priſoner that vnfortunate man King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth. Vpon the Weſt part of

name to this Prouince, ſeeing the earth doth ſtaine the wooll of her ſheepe into a reddiſh colour.
Neither is it ſtrange, that the ſtaine of the ſoyle giues names vnto places, and that very many: for

The Soile is rich, and for Corne and tillage giues place vnto none. Woods there are plentie, and

            <p>LEICESTER-SHIRE, lying bordered vpon the North with <hi>Nottingham-ſhire;</hi> vpon the
Eaſt, with <hi>Lincolne</hi> and <hi>Rutland;</hi> vpon the South with <hi>Northampton ſhire;</hi> and vpon the Weſt
with <hi>Watling-ſtreet-way</hi> is parted from <hi>Warwick-ſhire;</hi> the reſt being bounded with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines
of <hi>Darby,</hi> is a Country Champion, abounding in corne, but ſpary of woods, eſpecially in
the South and Eaſt parts, which are ſupplyed with pit-coales plenteouſly gotten in the North
of this Prouince, and with abundance of Cattle bred in the hilles beyond the Riuer <hi>Wreak,</hi> which is
nothing ſo well inhabited as the reſt.</p>
            <p>(2) The Ayre is gentle, milde, and temperate, and giueth appetite both to labour and reſt:
wholeſome it is, and draweth mans life to a long age, and that much without ſickneſſe; at <hi>Carleton</hi>
onely ſome defect of pronunciation appeareth in their ſpeech.</p>
            <p>(3) The ſoile thus conſiſting, the commodities are raiſed accordingly of Corne, Cattle, and
Coales; and in the Rockes neere <hi>Beuer</hi> are ſometimes found the <hi>Aſtroites,</hi> the Starre-like precious
Stone.</p>
            <p>(4) The ancient people that inhabited this Countie, were the <hi>Coritani,</hi> who were ſpread further
into other Shires, but after that the <hi>Romans</hi> had left the Land to it ſelfe, this with many more fell
to be vnder the poſſeſſion and gouernment of the <hi>Mercians,</hi> and their Kings, from whom the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
enioyeth it at this day.</p>
            <p>(5) In Circular-wiſe (almoſt) the compaſſe of this Shire is drawne indifferently ſpacious, but
not very thicke of Incloſures, being from <hi>Eaſt</hi> to Weſt in the broadeſt part not fully 30. miles, and
<pb facs="tcp:3363:94"/>
from North to South but 24. the whole circumference about 196. miles; whoſe principall Citie is
ſet, as the Center, almoſt in the midſt; from whom the Pole is eleuated 53. degrees and 4 minutes
in Latitude, and for Longitude, 19. degrees, 22. minutes.</p>
            <p>(6) From this Towne the Shire hath the name, though the name of her ſelfe is diuerſly written,
as <hi>Legeceſtria, Legora, Legeo-ceſter:</hi> by <hi>Ninius, Caer-Lerion;</hi> by <hi>Mathew</hi> of <hi>Weſtminiſter</hi> (if we doe
not miſtake him) <hi>Wirall;</hi> and now laſtly, <hi>Leiceſter:</hi> ancient enough if King <hi>Leir</hi> was her builder,
eight hundred fortie and foure yeares before the birth of our Sauiour, wherein he placed a Flamine
to ſerue in the Temple of <hi>Ianus,</hi> by himſelfe there erected, and where he was buried, if <hi>Ieffery ap Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur</hi>
ſay true: but now certaine it is, that <hi>Ethelred</hi> the <hi>Mercian</hi> Monarch made it an Epiſcopall See,
in the yeare of Chriſt Ieſus 680. wherein <hi>Sexwulph</hi> of his election became the firſt Biſhop: which
ſhortly after was thence tranſlated, and therewith the beautie of the Towne began to decay; vpon
whoſe deſolations that erectifying Lady <hi>Edelſted</hi> caſt her eyes of compaſſion, and both reedified the
buildings, and compaſſed it about with a ſtrong wall, where, in ſhort time the Cities trade ſo increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
that <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> in his leſſer Story reporteth as followeth; <hi>Lege-ceſter</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is a right
wealthy Citie, and notably defended; and had the wall a ſure foundation, were inferiour to no Citie what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer.</hi>
But this pride of proſperitie long laſted not vnder the <hi>Normans,</hi> for it was ſore oppreſſed with
a world of calamities, when <hi>Robert Boſſu</hi> the Crouch-backe Earle of that <hi>Prouince,</hi> rebelled againſt
his Soueraigne Lord King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond: whereof heare the ſame Author <hi>Paris</hi> ſpeake: <hi>Through
the obſtinate ſtubborneſſe of Earle</hi> Robert (ſaith he) <hi>the noble Citie</hi> Leiceſter <hi>was beſieged and throwne
downe by King</hi> Henry, <hi>and the wall that ſeemed indiſſoluble, was vtterly raced, euen to the ground.</hi>
The peeces of whoſe fragments ſo fallen downe, remained in his dayes like to hard rockes, through
the ſtrength of the Morter cementing whole lumpes together: and at the Kings command the Citie
was ſet on fire and burnt, the Caſtle raced, and a heauit impoſition laid vpon the Citizens, who with
<pb facs="tcp:3363:95"/>
great ſummes of money bought their owne Baniſhments: but were ſo vſed in their departure, that
for extreame feare many of them tooke Sanctuary, both at S. <hi>Edmunds</hi> and S. <hi>Albanes.</hi> In repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of theſe miſchiefes, the Author thereof, <hi>Earle Robert,</hi> built the Monaſtery of S. <hi>Mary de Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi>
wherein himſelfe became a Canon regular, and for fifteene yeares continuance in ſad laments
ſerued God in continuall prayers. With the like deuotion, <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> built
an Hoſpitall for an hundred and ten poore people, with a Collegiate Church, a Deane, twelue Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons

            <p>At <hi>Redmore,</hi> neere <hi>Boſworth,</hi> Weſtward in this Countie, the Kingdome of <hi>England</hi> lay in hazard
of one Battle, when King <hi>Richards</hi> Field was fought, where the Land at once was freed from a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant

            <p>NOTTINGHAM-SHIRE (from <hi>Nottingham</hi> her chiefeſt Towne hath the name; and
that, ſomewhat ſoftned from the <hi>Saxons</hi> Snoddenzaham, for the many Dennes or Caues
wrought in her Rocks and vnder ground) lyeth bordered vpon the North &amp; North weſt
with <hi>York-ſhire;</hi> vpon the Eaſt a good diſtance by <hi>Trent</hi> is parted froM, and with <hi>Lincoln-ſhire</hi>
altogether confined: the South with <hi>Leiceſter-ſhire;</hi> and the Weſt by the Riuer <hi>Erwaſh</hi>
is ſeperated from <hi>Darby-ſhire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(2) For forme long and Ouall-wiſe, doubling in length twice her bredth, whoſe extreames
are thus extended and diſtance obſerued: From <hi>Finingley</hi> North to <hi>Sleanford</hi> in the South, are thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
eight <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles; her Weſt part from <hi>Teuerſall</hi> to <hi>Beſthorp</hi> in the Eaſt, are little more then nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene;
whoſe circumference draweth much vpon one hundred and ten miles.</p>
            <p>(3) The Ayre is good, wholeſome and delectable: the Soile is rich, ſandy and clayie, as by the
names of that Counties diuiſions may appeare: and ſurely for Corne and Graſſe ſo fruitfull, that it
ſecondeth any other in the Realme: and for Water, Woods, and Canell Coales abundantly ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
            <p>(4) Therein groweth a Stone ſofter then <hi>Alablaſter,</hi> but being burnt maketh a plaiſter harder
then that of <hi>Paris:</hi> wherewith they flower their vpper roomes; for betwixt the Ioyſts they lay one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
long Bulruſhes, and thereon ſpread this Plaiſter, which being throughly dry becomes moſt ſolide
and hard, ſo that it ſeemeth rather to be firme ſtone then mortar, and is trod vpon without all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
            <p>

In the Weſt neere <hi>Workſop</hi> groweth plentie of <hi>Liquorice,</hi> very delicious and good.</p>
            <p>(5) More South in this Shire, at <hi>Stoke,</hi> in the Raigne of King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeauenth, a great battle
was fought by <hi>Iohn De-la-Pole</hi> Earle of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> which <hi>Richard</hi> the Vſurper had declared his heire ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant;
but <hi>Richard</hi> loſing his life, and <hi>De-la Pole</hi> his hopes, in ſeeking here to ſet vp a <hi>Lambert,</hi> fell
downe himſelfe: and at <hi>Newarke</hi> after many troubles King <hi>Iohn</hi> got his peace with the end of his
life.</p>
            <p>(6) Trade and commerce for the Counties prouiſion is frequented in eight Market-Townes
in this Shire, whereof <hi>Nottingham</hi> is both the greateſt and beſt: a Towne ſeated moſt pleaſant and

hand of <hi>Dauid</hi> the ſecond King of <hi>Scots,</hi> whilſt he was therein detained priſoner. Another wherein
Lord <hi>Mortimer</hi> was ſurpriſed in the non-age of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, euer ſince beating the
name of <hi>Mortimers Hole;</hi> theſe haue their ſtaires and ſeuerall roomes made artifically euen out of the
Rockes: as alſo in that hill are dwelling houſes, with winding ſtaires, windowes, chimneys, and
roome aboue roome, wrought all out of the ſolide Rocke. The Caſtle is ſtrong, and was kept by
the <hi>Danes</hi> againſt <hi>Burthred, Ethelred,</hi> and <hi>Elfred,</hi> the <hi>Mercian,</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Saxon</hi> Kings, who together
laid their ſiege againſt it: and for the further ſtrength of the Towne, King <hi>Edward,</hi> ſurnamed the
Elder, walled it about, whereof ſome part as yet remaines, from the Caſtle to the Weſt-gate, and
thence the foundation may be perceiued to the North; where in the midſt of the way ranging with
this banke, ſtands a gate of Stone, and the ſame tract paſſing along the North part may well be

perceiued: the reſt to the Riuer, and thence to the Caſtle are built vpon, and thereby buried from
ſight: whoſe circuit, as I tooke it, extendeth two thouſand one hundred and twentie paſes.</p>

that great cures by theſe waters haue beene done: but daily experience ſheweth, that they
are good for the ſtomacke and ſinewes, and very pleaſant to bathe the body in. Not farre thence

trickle from the top of that Caue (which indeed is very ſpacious, but of a low and narrow entrance)
doe congeale into ſtone, and hang as ickles in the roofe. Some of them were ſhewed at my being

            <p>(5) This Riuer was once the bounds of the <hi>North-Britaines,</hi> and diuided their poſſeſſion from
the Land of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> vntill of latter times theirs began to decay, and the <hi>Welſh</hi> to increaſe, who
<pb facs="tcp:3363:106"/>
enlarged their liſts to the Riuer <hi>Dee.</hi> So formerly had it ſeparated the <hi>Ordouices</hi> from the <hi>Cornauji,</hi>
thoſe ancient Inhabitants mentioned by <hi>Ptolemie.</hi> The <hi>Ordouices</hi> vnder <hi>Caractachus</hi> purchaſed great
honour, whileſt he a Prince of the <hi>Silures</hi> remoued his warres thence among them, where a while
he maintained the <hi>Britaines</hi> libertie with valour and courage, in deſpight of the <hi>Romans.</hi> His Fort is

<hi>Temd,</hi> where (in remembrance of him) the place is yet called <hi>Caer-Caradoc,</hi> a Fort of his, wonne by
<hi>P. Oſtorius</hi> Lieutenant of the <hi>Romans,</hi> about the yeare of grace 53. The <hi>Cornauji</hi> were feared vpon
the North of <hi>Scuerne,</hi> and branched into other Counties, of whom we haue ſaid.</p>
            <p>(6) But when the ſtrength of the <hi>Romans</hi> was too weake to ſupport their owne Empire, and <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine</hi>
emptied of her Souldiers to reſiſt, the <hi>Saxons</hi> ſet foot in this moſt faire ſoile, and made it a part
of their <hi>Mercian Kingdome:</hi> their line likewiſe iſſued to the laſt period, and the <hi>Normans</hi> beginning
where theſe <hi>Saxons</hi> left, the <hi>Welſhmen</hi> tooke aduantage of all preſent occaſions, and brake ouer <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne</hi>

hooke from the wall, had not <hi>Stephen</hi> preſently reſcued him, <hi>Anno</hi> 1139.</p>
            <p>(7) This then being the <hi>Marches</hi> of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> was ſore afflicted by bloudy broiles,
which cauſed many of their Townes to be ſtrongly walled, and thirtie two Caſtles to be ſtrongly

<hi>Arthur,</hi> to be reſident at <hi>Ludlow,</hi> where that faire Caſtle became a moſt famous Princes Court.
And here King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight ordained the Counſell of the <hi>Marches,</hi> conſiſting of a Lord Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,

            <p>(8) But the Shire-Towne <hi>Shrewesburie,</hi> for circuit, trade, and wealth, doth farre exceed this,
and is inferiour to few of our Cities; her buildings faire, her ſtreets many and large, her Citizens

and of a large compaſſe, extending to ſeauenteene hundred paſes about, beſides another Bulwarke

and Barres, and the third into the North, no leſſe ſtrong then them, ouer which is mounted a large

which extreames, in following the windings of the Shires diuder from Eaſt to Weſt, are 47. miles:
and from North to South twentie-ſixe miles. The whole circumference about one hundred fortie

            <p>(3) If the affection to my naturall producer blind not the judgement of this my ſuruey, for aire

Climate be cold, and toucheth the degree of Latitude 54. yet the warmth from the <hi>Iriſh Seas</hi> mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth

The Champion grounds make glad the hearts of their Tillers: the Meadowes imbrodered with

            <p>And let me adde thus much, which <hi>Lucian</hi> could not; namely, that this Shire hath neuer beene

            <p>(6) The Commodities of this Prouince (by the report of <hi>Ranulphus</hi> the Monke of <hi>Cheſter)</hi> are
chiefly <hi>Corne, Cattle, Fiſh, Fowle, Salt, Mines, Metals, Meares,</hi> and <hi>Riuers,</hi> whereof the bankes of <hi>Dee</hi>

CHAPTER XXXVII.</head>
            <p>THE Countie Palatine of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> (famous for the foure <hi>Henries,</hi> the fourth, fift, ſixt, and
ſeauenth, Kings of <hi>England,</hi> deriued from <hi>Iohn of Gaunt</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaſter)</hi> is vpon the South
confined and parted by the Riuer <hi>Merſcy,</hi> from the Countie Palatine of <hi>Cheſter;</hi> the faire
Countie of <hi>Darby-ſhire</hi> bordering vpon the Eaſt; the large Country of <hi>Yorkeſhire,</hi> together

            <p>(2) The forme thereof is long, for it is ſo incloſed betweene <hi>Yorke ſhire</hi> on the Eaſt ſide, and
the <hi>Iriſh Sea</hi> on the Weſt, that where it boundeth vpon <hi>Cheſhire</hi> on the South-ſide, it is broader, and
by little and little more Northward it goeth (confining vpon <hi>Weſtmerland)</hi> the more narrow it

            <p>(4) The Soile for the generalitie is not very fruitfull, yet it produceth ſuch numbers of Cattle,
of ſuch large proportion, and ſuch goodly heads, and hornes, as the whole Kingdome of <hi>Spaine</hi>

ſorts of Fiſh, Fleſh, and Fowles. Their principall fuell is Coale and Turffe, which they haue in
great abundance, the Gentlemen reſeruing their woods very carefully, as a beautie and principall
ornament to their Mannors and houſes. And though it be farre from <hi>London</hi> (the capitall Citie of
this Kingdome) yet doth it euery yeare furniſh her and many other parts of the Land beſides, with
many thouſands of Cattle (bred in this Country) giuing thereby and otherwayes a firme teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
to the world, of the bleſſed abundance that it hath pleaſed God to enrich this noble Dukedome
withall.</p>
            <p>(5) This Counties ancient Inhabitants were the <hi>Brigantes,</hi> of whom there is more mention in
the deſcription of <hi>Yorkeſhire,</hi> who by <hi>Claudius</hi> the Emperour were brought vnder the <hi>Roman</hi> ſubiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that ſo held and made it their Seat, ſecured by their Garriſons, as hath beene gathered as well
by many inſcriptions found in walles and ancient monuments fixed in ſtones, as by certaine Altars
erected in fauour of their Emperours. After the <hi>Romans,</hi> the <hi>Saxons</hi> brought it vnder their protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and held it for a part of their <hi>Northumbrian</hi> Kingdome, till it was firſt made ſubiugate to the
inuaſion of the <hi>Danes,</hi> and then conquered by the victorious <hi>Normans,</hi> whoſe poſterities from thence
are branched further into <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(6) Places of antiquitie or memorable note are theſe: the Towne of <hi>Mancheſter</hi> (ſo famous, as
well for the Market-place, Church, and Colledge, as for the reſort vnto it for clothing) was called
<hi>Mancunium</hi> by <hi>Antonine</hi> the Emperour, and was made a Fort and Station of the <hi>Romans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Riblecheſter</hi> (which taketh the name from <hi>Rhibell,</hi> a little Riuer neere <hi>Clithero)</hi> though it be a ſmall
Towne, yet by tradition hath beene called the richeſt Towne in Chriſtendome, and reported to
haue beene the Seat of the <hi>Romans,</hi> which the many Monuments of their Antiquities, Statues, pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb facs="tcp:3363:112"/>
of Coine, and other ſeuerall inſcription, digd vp from time to time by the Inhabitants, may
giue vs ſufficient perſwaſion to beleeue.</p>
            <p>But the Shire-Towne is <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> more pleaſant in ſituation, then rich of Inhabitants, built on

Towne is in the Church, Caſtle, and Bridge: her ſtreets many, and ſtretched farre in length. Vnto
this Towne King <hi>Edward</hi> the third granted a Maior and two Bailiffes, which to this day are elected
out of twelue Brethren, aſſiſted by twentie-foure Burgeſſes, by whom it is yearely gouerned, with
the ſupply of two Chamberlaines, a Recorder, Towne-Clerke, and two Sergeants at Mace. The

            <p>(7) This Country in diuers places ſuffereth the force of many flowing Tides of the Sea, by

            <p>(8) This Country, as it is thus on the one ſide freed by the naturall reſiſtance of the Sea from
<pb facs="tcp:3363:112"/>
the force of Inuaſions, ſo is it ſtrengthned on the other by many Caſtles and fortified places, that
take away the opportunitie of making Roades and Incurſions in the Country. And as it was with
the firſt that felt the fury of the <hi>Saxons</hi> crueltie, ſo was it the laſt and longeſt that was ſubdued vnder
the <hi>Weſt-Saxons</hi> Monarchie.</p>
            <p>(9) In this Prouince our noble <hi>Arthur</hi> (who died laden with many trophics of honour) is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported

to diminiſh from the dignitie of ſo worthy a Country; nor ſo prodigally, as to ſpend time in the
ſuperfluous praiſing of that which neuer any (as yet) diſpraiſed. And although perhaps it may ſeeme
a labour vnneceſſary, to make relation of ancient remembrances, either of the Name or Nature of
this Nation, eſpecially looking into the difference of Time it ſelfe (which in euery age bringeth
forth diuerſe effects) and the diſpoſitions of men, that for the moſt part take leſſe pleaſure in them,
then in divulging the occurrents of their owne times: yet I hold it not vnfit to begin there, from

If one part of her be ſtony, and a ſandy barren ground: another is fertile and richly adorned with

            <p>(8) Many places of this Prouince are famouſed as well by Name, being naturally fortunate in

no meanes either of long prayſes or large promiſes, able to gaine like affection at her hands, when he
ſaw his hopes fruſtrate, and that he was not like to haue his purpoſe of her, turned his loue into rage,
and cut off the maides head, which being afterwards hung vpon an Ewe tree, common people coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it as an hallowed relique till it was rotten: And afterwards (ſuch was the credulitie of that time)
it maintained the opinion of reuerence and Religion ſtill: for the people reſorted thither on pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
and perſwaded themſelues, that the little veynes that ſpread out betweene the Barke and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of the Ewe tree like fine threds, were the very haires of the maids head. Hereupon it was called

Egbert</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Yorke,</hi> who flouriſhed about the yeare ſeauen hundred fortie, erected in it a

            <p>The originall of this Citie cannot be fetcht out but from the <hi>romanes,</hi> ſeeing the <hi>Britaines</hi> before

and his ſuppoſed defence againſt the <hi>Scots</hi> was ſuch, that our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Kings in great deuotion

augmented and confirmed their Liberties. This Saint then, of nothing made <hi>Durham</hi> become great,

by ſome later <hi>Weſtmoria,</hi> and in our Engliſh Tongue <hi>Weſtmorland</hi> It came
to be thus named in our language by the ſituation, which in euery part is ſo plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly

(with vs) is nothing elſe but a Weſterne mooriſh Country. Hauing on the Weſt

miles: the broadeſt part from Eaſt to Weſt, is from the Riuer <hi>Eden</hi> to <hi>Dunbal raſe-ſtones,</hi> containing
24. miles, the whole circumference about 112. miles.</p>
            <p>(3) The forme thereof is ſomewhat long and narrow: the Aire ſharpe and piercing, purging
it ſelfe from the trouble of groſſe foggy miſts and vapours, by reaſon of which the people of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince
are not acquainted with ſtrange diſeaſes or imperfections of body, but liue long, and are health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and attaine to the number of many yeares.</p>
            <p>(4) The Soile for the moſt part of it, is but barren, and can hardly be brought to any fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
by the induſtry and painfull labour of the husbandman, being ſo full of infertile places, which
the Northern <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> call Moores: yet the more Southerly part is not reported to be ſo ſterile,
but more fruitfull in the vallies, though contained in a narrow roome, betweene the Riuer <hi>Lone,</hi> and

name aboue them, and hath great vent &amp; traſhque for her wollen cloaths through all the parts
of <hi>England.</hi> It challengeth not much glory for Antiquitie; onely this it accounteth a great credit,
that it hath dignified three Earles with the title thereof, as <hi>Iohn</hi> Duke of <hi>Bedford,</hi> whom <hi>Henry</hi> the
Fift (being his brother) aduanced to that honour, <hi>Iohn</hi> Duke of <hi>Sommerſet,</hi> and <hi>Iohn de Foix,</hi> whom
King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixt preferred to that dignitie for his honourable and truſty ſeruices done in the

more Eaſt-ward with <hi>Weſtmerland,</hi> the South with <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> and the Weſt is wholly waſhed
with the <hi>Iriſh Seas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(2) The forme whereof is long and narrow, pointing wedge-like into the South, which part is
altogether peſtred with copped-hilles, and therefore hath the name of <hi>Cop-land.</hi> The middle is more
leuell, and better inhabited, yeelding ſufficient for the ſuſtenance of man: but the North is wilde
and ſolitary, combred with hilles, as <hi>Copland</hi> is.</p>
            <p>(3) The ayre is piercing, and of a ſharpe temperature, and would be more biting, were it not
that thoſe high hilles breake off the Northerne ſtormes, and cold falling ſnowes.</p>
            <p>(4) Notwithſtanding, rich is this Prouince, and with great varieties thereof is repleniſhed: the
hilles, though rough, yet ſmile vpon their beholders, ſpread with ſheepe and cattle, the vallies ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

varietie of fowles, and the Riuers feed a kinde of Muskle that bringeth forth Pearle, where in the
mouth of the <hi>Irt,</hi> as they lie gaping and ſucking in dew, the Country people gather and ſell to the
<hi>Lapidaries,</hi> to their owne little, and the buyers great gaine. But the <hi>Mines Royall</hi> of <hi>Copper,</hi> whereof
this Country yeeldeth much, is for vſe the richeſt of all: the place is at <hi>Keſwick</hi> and <hi>Newland,</hi> where
<pb facs="tcp:3363:124"/>
likewiſe the <hi>Blacke Lead</hi> is gotten, whoſe plentie maketh it of no great eſteeme; otherwiſe a commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie
that could hardly be miſſed.</p>
            <p>(5) The ancient Inhabitants knowne to the <hi>Romans,</hi> were the <hi>Brigantes,</hi> whom <hi>Ptolemie</hi> diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth

But when the State of the <hi>Saxons</hi> was fore ſhaken by the <hi>Danes,</hi> this <hi>Cumberland</hi> was accounted

CHAPTER XLII.</head>
            <p>THe County of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> hath on the South the Biſhopricke of <hi>Durham,</hi> being ſhut in
with the Riuer <hi>Derwent,</hi> and with <hi>Tyne;</hi> the North is confined vpon <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Weſt vpon
part of <hi>Scotland</hi> and part of <hi>Cumberland:</hi> the Eaſt-ſide lyeth altogether vpon the Sea, called
<hi>Mare-Germanicum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(2) The forme thereof is Triangle, and differs not much in the ſidings; for from her South-Eaſt
vnto the South-Weſt-point are neere vnto 40. miles; from thence to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> North-point are ſixty

               </gap> is about one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
fortie fiue miles.</p>
            <p>(3) The Ayre muſt needs be ſubtile and piercing, for that the Northernly parts are moſt expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to extremitie of weathers, as great winds, hard froſts, and long lying of ſnowes, &amp;c. Yet would
it be farre more ſharper then it is, were not the <hi>Germane Seas</hi> a ready meanes to further the diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of her Ice and Snow, and the plentie of Coales there gotten, a great helpe to comfort the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
with warmth, and defend the bitter coldneſſe.</p>
            <p>(4) The Soile cannot be rich, hauing neither fertilitie of ground for Corne or Cattle, the moſt
part of it being rough, and in euery place hard to be manured, ſaue onely towards the Sea and the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<hi>Tyne,</hi> where, by the great diligence and induſtrious paines of good husbandry, that part is become
very fruitfull.</p>
            <p>(5) The ancient Inhabitants of this Country, mentioned by <hi>Ptolemie,</hi> were called OTTALI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NI,
OTTADENI, and OTTADINI, which by an eaſie alteration (as M. <hi>Cambden</hi> ſaith) if it

the Inhabitants, and the Poſition and Site of the Prouince.</p>
            <p>(6) The chiefeſt commoditie that enricheth this Countie, are thoſe Stones <hi>Linthancraces,</hi> which
we call Sea-coales, whereof there is ſuch plentie and abundance digged vp, as they doe not onely
returne a great gaine to the Inhabitants, but procure alſo much pleaſure and profit to others.</p>
            <p>(7) No place of this Prouince vents forth ſo many of theſe Sea-coales into other regions as
<hi>Newcaſtle</hi> doth, being the very eye of all the Townes in this County: for it doth not onely mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
reliefe (by ſuch prouiſion) to all other parts of <hi>England,</hi> but doth alſo farniſh the wants of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine
Countries with her plentie. By meanes of this and the intercourſe of traffique which it hath,
the place is growne ex<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

a bulwarke or place of defence, ſhewes that in ancient time it had beene a place of Fortification.</p>
            <p>(8) After the <hi>Conqueſt</hi> it got the name of <hi>Newcaſtle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> by the new Caſtle which <hi>Robert</hi> the Sonne
of <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Conquerour</hi> built there, out of the ground. What it was called in old time is not
knowne, yet ſome are of opinion, that it may be thought to haue beene <hi>Gatroſentum</hi> for that <hi>Gateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi>

            <p>(9) The vtmoſt Towne in <hi>England,</hi> and the ſtrongeſt hold in all <hi>Britaine,</hi> is <hi>Barwicke.</hi> From
whence it had the name is not certainely made knowne. Some fetch it from <hi>Berengarius,</hi> a Duke
(neuer read of:) Howſoeuer, this is better to be ſaid then truſted: and whence ſoeuer it hath the
name, it is ſeated betweene two mightie Kingdomes, ſhooting farre into the Sea, with the which,
and the Riuer <hi>Tweed,</hi> it is almoſt encompaſſed: and whenſoeuer any diſcord fell betweene the two
Nations, this place was the firſt thing they tooke care of. It hath endured the brunts of diuers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roades
and incurſions, and beene oftentimes both poſſeſſed and repoſſeſſed of the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh:</hi>
But ſince it was reduced vnder the command of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, our Kings haue from time

            <p>(10) The Inhabitants of this County are a warlike people, and excellent light horſemen, and are
made fierce and hard by the ſeuerall encounters of the <hi>Scots,</hi> and not much vnlike them in neither,
betwixt whom in this County, many Battles haue beene fought, and the ſucceſſes oftentimes waued

(5) This commoditie makes this Iland more happie then we are here: for the people are there
free from vnneceſſary commencements of Suites, from long and dilatory Pleas, and from friuolous
feeing of Lawyers No Iudge or Clerks of the Court take there any penny for drawing Inſtruments,
or making of Proceſſes All Controuerſies are there determined by certaine Iudges, without wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
or other charges, and them they call <hi>Deemſters,</hi> and chuſe forth among themſelues, If any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
be made to the Magiſtrate for wrongs eyther done or ſuffred, he preſently taketh vp a ſtone,
and fixeth his marke vpon it, and ſo deliuereth it vnto the partie plaintiffe, by vertue of which he
both cals his aduerſary to appearance, and to produce his witneſſes. If the caſe fall out to be more
litigious, and of greater conſequence then can eaſily be ended, it is then referred to twelue men,
whom they terme <hi>The Keyes of the Iland.</hi> Another happineſſe enricheth this Iland, namely the ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and gouernment thereof, as being defended from neighbour enemies by Souldiers that are preſt
and ready; for on the South-ſide of the Ile ſtands <hi>Bala-Curi</hi> (the Biſhops chiefe place of reſidence)
and the <hi>Pyle,</hi> and a <hi>Block-houſe</hi> ſtanding in a little Iland, where there is a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuall Garriſon of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.
And it is ſo well managed for matter of rule and ciuill diſcipline, that tuery man there poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
his owne in peace and ſafetie. No man liues in dread or danger of loſing what he hath. Men
are not there inclined to robbing or theeuing, or licentious liuing.</p>
            <p>(6) The Inhabitants of this Iland are for the moſt part religious, and louing to their Paſtors,
to whom they doe much reuerence and reſpect, frequenting daily to diuine Seruice, without diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
in the Church or innouation in the Common-weale. The wealthier ſort, and ſuch as hold the
faireſt poſſeſſions, doe imitate the people of <hi>Lanca-ſhire,</hi> both in their honeſt carriage and good
houſe-keeping. Howbeit, the common ſort of people both in their language and manners, come

(7) Things not worthy to be buryed in the graue of obliuion are, that this Iland in the midſt
thereof riſeth vp with hils, ſtanding very thicke; amongſt which the higheſt is called <hi>Sceafull,</hi> from
whence vpon a cleare and faire day, a man may eaſily ſee three Kingdomes at once; that is, <hi>Scotland,
England,</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> This Ile prohibits the cuſtomary manner ofbegging from doore to doore,
deteſting the diſorders, as well Ciuill as Eccleſiaſticall of neighbour Nations. And laſt, not leaſt,
that deſerues to be committed to memory, is, that the women of this Country, whereſoeuer they
goe out of their doores, gird themſelues about with the winding-ſheete that they purpoſe to be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
in, to ſhew themſelues mindfull of their mortalitie: and ſuch of them as are at any time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
to dye, are ſowed within a ſacke, and flung from a rocke into the Sea.</p>
            <p>(8) The whole Iſle is diuided into two parts, South and North, whereof the one reſembleth the
<hi>Scotiſh</hi> in ſpeech, the other the <hi>Iriſh.</hi> It is defended by two Caſtles, and hath ſeauenteene Pariſhes,

            <p>THis Iland is called <hi>Lindisfarne,</hi> by the Riuer <hi>Lied</hi> that is oppoſite vnto it on the Coaſt of

it twice euery day ſuffreth an extraordinary inundation and ouer-flowing of the Ocean in
manner of an Iland, which twice likewiſe makes it continent to the Land, and returning vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

<hi>Holy-Iland,</hi> for that in ancient times many <hi>Monkes</hi> haue beene accuſtomed to retire themſelues thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and to make it their receptacle for ſolitude: hauing on the Weſt and South, <hi>Northumberland,</hi>
and more South-Eaſtward the Iland <hi>Farne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(2) The forme of it is long and narrow, the Weſt ſide narrower then the Eaſt, and are both

are ſubiect to extremitie of cold, and greatly troubled with vapours and toggy miſts that ariſe from

(5) Notwithſtanding, this is very worthy of note concerning the ſame, which <hi>Alcun</hi> wrote in
an Epiſtle to <hi>Egelred</hi> King of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> namely, that it was a place more venerable then all
the places of <hi>Britaine,</hi> and that after the departure of S. <hi>Paulinus</hi> from <hi>Yorke,</hi> there Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
began in their Nation, though afterwards it there felt the firſt beginning of miſery and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie,

               </gap>oants.</p>
            <p>(6) It is alſo remembred of this Iland, that ſometimes there hath beene in it an Epiſcopall See,
which <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Northumberland)</hi> being thus delighted with the ſolitary ſituation thereof, as a moſt fit place for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire.
But afterwards when the <hi>Danes</hi>

tranſlated to <hi>Durham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(7) This Iland ſo ſmall in account either for compaſſe or Commoditie, and ſo vnpeopled and
vnprofitable, cannot be numerous in Townes and Villages. It hath in it onely one Towne, with a
Church and a Caſtle, vnder which there is a commodious Hauen, defended with a Block-houſe, ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate
vpon in hill towards the South-Eaſt.</p>
            <div type="part">

which lie two miles off <hi>Bronſinan,</hi> and two leſſer then theſe, which are called the <hi>Wambes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(2) The forme of this Ile is round, and no larger in compaſſe then may eaſily be ridden
<pb facs="tcp:3363:136"/>
in one halfe of a day. The bredth of it is but fiue miles, and the length no more. The whole circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
extends it ſelfe no further then to fifteene miles.</p>
               <p>(3) The ayre is very vnwholeſome, and ſubiect both to many <hi>Dyſenteries</hi> and other diſeaſes,
by reaſon of the miſtie fogges and exhalations that are thereunto drawne vp from the Ocean. It is
many times troubled with vnuſuall tempeſts of windes, with boiſterous fury of ſtormy raines, and
with ſeuerall and vncouth rages of the Sea.</p>
               <p>(4) The ſoile cannot be fertile, being encircled about with craggy clifts; neither hath it in it
much matter either of pleaſure or profit. It can neither defend it ſelfe from cold, lacking fuell, as
Wood, Coale, Turffes, &amp;c. nor from famine, wanting food, as Corne, Paſtures, Cattle, &amp;c. The beſt
commoditie it yeelds, is Fiſh and Fowle.</p>

the rule and domination of <hi>France</hi> (at that time called <hi>Gaule,</hi> from whence the word <hi>Gallia</hi>
is deriued) did name this Iland <hi>Sarnia,</hi> which afterward by the change of Times and corruption of
Languages, was long ſince (and is at this day) called <hi>Garnſey.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(2) This Ile in forme and faſhion ſtandeth in the Sea, much like to a Parke that is incompaſſed
round about with a Pale of Rockes, being very defenſible vnto the Iland from the attempting inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation

               <p>(3) The Aire and Climate of this Ile hath little or no difference in temper or qualitie from that
of <hi>Ierſey.</hi> And this deſerues to be remembred of it; that in this Ile is neither Toade, Snake, Adder,
or any other venemous creature, and the other hath great plentie.</p>
               <p>(4) It ſtandeth for the moſt part vpon a rocke, very high in many places from the Sea. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe
the Soile is very fruitfull, yeelding forth great plentie of graſſe for their Sheepe and other
Cattell, which they haue to ſerue all vſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Their fields in the Summer time are ſo naturally garni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
with flowers of all ſorts, that a man (being there) might conceit himſelfe to be in a pleaſant
artificiall garden.</p>
               <p>(5) The Inhabitants are not ſo much giuen to tillage as they of <hi>Ierſey,</hi> though the ſoile be as
fruitfull. They haue of late taken great delight in planting and ſetting of trees of all ſorts, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
of Apples, by reaſon whereof they make much Cider. Their commodities are alike, and their
helpes from the Sea no leſſe, or rather more.</p>
               <p>

(6) In this Ile are many great ſteepe Rocks, among which is found a hard ſtone called by the
<hi>Frenchmen Smyris,</hi> which we terme <hi>Emerill.</hi> This ſtone is ſeruiceable for many purpoſes, and many
Trades, as Glaſiers, &amp;c. but eſpecially for the Goldſmiths and Lapidaries, to cut their precious
ſtones.</p>
               <p>(7) It hath a head of Land vpon the North part thereof, the paſſage into which is ſo narrow,
that a man would thinke that at euery Tyde (the Sea beating ſtrongly on both ſides) it were in a
continuall danger to be ſundred from the other part of the Ile. This place is called S. <hi>Michaelin the

            <p>(4) The Soile is hungry, though not barren, and that in the Eaſt and South the beſt: the other

<hi>Merioneth-ſhire</hi> with the Riuer <hi>Doui;</hi> by the <hi>Plinillimon</hi> hilles from <hi>Montgomery-ſhire</hi> in part

            <p>DENBIGH-SHIRE, called in <hi>Welſh, Sire Denbigh,</hi> retyring more from the Sea within the
Countrey, on this ſide of the Riuer <hi>Conwey</hi> ſhooteth Eaſtward in one place as farre as to the
Riuer <hi>Dee:</hi> on the North, firſt the Sea (for a ſmall ſpace) and then <hi>Plint-ſhire</hi> encompaſſeth
it: on the Weſt, <hi>Caernaruon</hi> and <hi>Merioneth-ſhire;</hi> on the Eaſt, <hi>Cheſhire</hi> and <hi>Shrop-ſhire;</hi> and on

            </p>
            <p>(2) The forme thereof is long, growing wider ſtill towards the North-weſt, and narrower
towards the Eaſt It is in length from Eaſt to Weſt, one and thirtie miles, and in bredth from North
to South, ſeauenteene miles: in the whole circuit and circumference, one hundred and fourteene
miles.</p>
            <p>(3) The ayre is very wholeſome and pleaſant, yet bleake enough, as expoſed to the windes on
all ſides, and the high hilles, wherewith it is in many places enuitoned, long retaining the congealed
ſnow. The tops whereof, in the Summer time, are the harueſt-mens Almanacks, by the riſing of
certaine vapours thereon in the mornings, and foreſhew a faire day enſuing.</p>
            <p>(4) The ſoyle is but barren towards the Weſt part: yet the middle, where it lieth flat in a valley,
is moſt fertile. The Eaſt ſide, when it is once paſt the valley, findeth Nature to be a very ſparing nig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of her ſauours: but next vnto <hi>Dee</hi> it feeleth a more liberall extent of her bleſſings. The Weſt
part is but here and there inhabited, and mounteth vp more then the other with bare and hungry
hilles: yet the leaneſſe of the ſoyle (where the hils ſettle any thing flatting) hath beene now a
good while begun to be ouercome by the diligent paines and carefull induſtry of the husbandmen;
<pb facs="tcp:3363:161"/>
for they paring away the vpper coat of the earth into certaine Turffes, with a broad kinde of ſpade,
pile them vp artificially on heapes, and fire them, ſo as being turned into aſhes, and throwne vpon

            <p>FLINT-SHIRE, ſtretching out in length, broad at one end, and narrow at another, is not
much vnlike in faſhion to a wedge, a peece of which is cut off by the meeting of <hi>Cheſhire</hi> and

            </p>
            <p>(2) This Country is nothing mountainous, as other parts of <hi>Wales</hi> are, but riſing gently all along
the Riuer of <hi>Dee,</hi> makes a faire ſhew and proſpect of her ſelfe to euery eye that beholds her, as well
vpon the Riuer, being in moſt places thereabouts foure or fiue miles broad, as vpon the other ſide
thereof, being a part of <hi>Cheſhire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(3) The Aire is healthfull and temperate, without any foggie clouds or fennie vapours, ſauing
that ſometimes there ariſeth from the Sea, and the Riuer <hi>Dee,</hi> certaine thicke and ſmoky-ſeeming
miſts, which neuertheleſſe are not found hurtfull to the Inhabitants, who in this part liue long and
healthfully.</p>
            <p>(4) The Clime is ſomewhat colder there then in <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> by reaſon of the Sea, and the Riuer
that engirts the better part of her; by which, the Northerne windes being long carried vpon the
waters, blow the more cold; and that ſide of the Country vpward, that lieth ſhoaring vnto the top,
hauing neither ſhelter nor defence, receiueth them in their full power, and is naturally a Bulwarke
<pb facs="tcp:3363:163"/>
from their violence vnto her bordering neighbours, that maketh the ſnow to lie much longer there
then on the other ſide of the Riuer.</p>
            <p>(5) The Soile bringeth forth plentie both of Corne and Graſſe, as alſo great ſtore of Cattle,
but they be little. To ſupply which defect, they haue more by much in their numbers then in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
places where they be bigger. Great ſtore of Fiſh they take in the Riuer of <hi>Dee,</hi> but little from
the Sea, by reaſon they haue no Hauens or Creekes for boats. No great ſtore of woods either there
or in any other part of <hi>Wales</hi> are found, it hauing beene a generall plague vnto all the Country euer

(in time) tooke away the principall helpes of their Innouations, by cutting downe their woods,
whereof in this Shire there hath heretofore beene great plentie. Fruits are ſcarce, but milke, butter,
and cheeſe plentie, as alſo ſtore of hony, of the which they make a pleaſant wine, in colour like (in

Cambrenſis,</hi> neere the place now called <hi>Holy-well,</hi> was a rich Mine of Siluer, in ſeeking after which,
men pierced and pried into the very bowels of the earth.</p>
            <p>(6) The ancient Inhabitants of this Country were the <hi>Ordouices,</hi> a ſturdie people againſt the

            <p>(7) Places of defence are the Caſtles of <hi>Flint, Hawarden,</hi> vulgarly <hi>Harden, Treer, Rudland, Mold,

Duke of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> loſing at that time his libertie, and not long after his life. This ſtandeth

            <p>For the Caſtle of <hi>Hawarden,</hi> no record remaines of the firſt founder, but that it was held a long
time by the Stewards of the Earles of <hi>Cheſter.</hi> Howbeit, their reſiſtances did not ſo generally conſiſt
in the ſtrength of their Caſtles and Fortifications, as in their Mountaines and Hils, which in times
of danger ſerued as naturall Bulwarkes and Defences vnto them againſt the force of enemies. As
was that which ſtandeth in a certaine ſtrait ſet about with woods, neere vnto the Riuer, <hi>Alen,</hi> called
<hi>Coles-hull,</hi> that is, <hi>Coles-hill,</hi> where the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> by reaſon of their diſordered multitude, not ranged
cloſe in good array, loſt the field, and were defeated, when King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond had made as great

<hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> who was Standard-bearer to the Kings of <hi>England</hi> in right of inheritance.</p>
            <p>(8) This Country hath many ſhallow riuers in it, but none of fame and note, but <hi>Dee</hi> and <hi>Cluyde.</hi>
Howbeit, there is a Spring not farre from <hi>Rudland Caſtle,</hi> of great report and antiquitie, which is
termed <hi>Fons Sacer,</hi> in Engliſh, <hi>Holy-Well,</hi> and is alſo commonly called S. <hi>Winefrids Well;</hi> of whom an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie
thus reporteth: That <hi>Winefrid</hi> a Chriſtian Virgin, very faire and vertuous, was doated vpon
by a young luſtfull Prince or Lord of the Country, who not long able to rule his head-ſtrong af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
hauing many times in vaine attempted and tryed her chaſtitie both by rich gifts and large
promiſes, could not by any meanes obtaine his deſires; he therefore (in a place of aduantage) ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
ſurprized and rauiſhed her weake (yet reſiſting) body. After the deed done, the cruell Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
to ſtop her cries and acclamations, ſlew her, and cut off her head: out of which place did ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
ariſe a Spring that continueth to this day, carrying from the Fountaine ſuch a forcible ſtreame
and current, as the like is not found in Chriſtendome. Ouer the head of the Spring there is built a
Chappell of free ſtone, with Pillars curiouſly wrought and engraued, in the Chancell whereof, and
<pb facs="tcp:3363:164"/>
glaſſe window, the picture of the Virgin is drawne, together with the memoriall of her life and death.
To this Fountaine Pilgrims are accuſtomed to repaire in their zealous, but blind deuotion; and
diuers others reſort to bathe in, holding firmely that the water is of much vertue.</p>
            <p>There be many red ſtones in the bottome of this Well, and much greene moſſe growing vpon
the ſides: the ſuperſtition of the people holding that thoſe red ſpots in the ſtones were drops of the
Ladies bloud, which all the water in the Spring can neuer waſh away; and that the moſſe about the
wall was her haire, which though ſome of it be giuen to euery ſtranger that comes, yet it neuer wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth.
But howſoeuer this be carried for truth by the tradition of time, the moſſe it ſelfe ſmels ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding

            <p>There is alſo hard by <hi>Kilken</hi> (a ſmall village) within this Countie, a little Well of no great note,
that at certaine times riſeth and falleth, after the manner of Sea-tydes.</p>
            <p>(9) In the South part of this Country, diuided from the reſt, is a place (in ſome written Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies
of <hi>Antonine,</hi> called <hi>Bouium)</hi> which we now terme <hi>Banchor,</hi> firſt a Citie, and afterwards a Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery

<hi>Angleſey,</hi> (which the <hi>Britaines</hi> call <hi>Mon,)</hi> and in compoſition was termed alſo <hi>Snow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den-Forreſt,</hi>
before <hi>Wales</hi> was laid into Shires; the North-ſide whereof and the Weſt butteth
vpon the <hi>Iriſh Sea,</hi> the South-ſide is incloſed with <hi>Merioneth,</hi> and the Eaſt with <hi>Denbigh-ſhires,</hi>
from which it is ſeuered by the Riuer <hi>Conwey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(2) The forme thereof is much like a wedge, long and narrow toward the South, and growing
ſtill wider towards the North: ſo that from <hi>Penenkel-point</hi> South-ward, to <hi>Ormſ-head-point</hi> North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
are fortie miles, from the Riuer <hi>Conwey</hi> Eaſtward, to the Riuer <hi>Llenoy</hi> Weſtward, miles twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:
and the whole circumference one hundred and ten miles.</p>
            <p>(3) The Aire is ſharpe and piercing, by reaſon that the Country hath not naturall prouiſion to
enſconce her ſelfe againſt the extremitie of winds and weather: but eſpecially as may be thought,
through the continuance of the Snow on the hils, which alſo exclude the Suns aſpect and warmth.</p>
            <p>(4) The ſoile cannot be much commended for the fertilitie, except thoſe parts of the Sea-coaſts,
which lye on the Weſt towards <hi>Ireland:</hi> but for the heart of this Shire, it is altogether mountainous,
as if Nature had a purpoſe here, by rearing vp theſe craggy hils ſo thicke together, ſtrongly to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact
the ioynts of this our Iland, and to frame the Inland part thereof for a fit place of refuge to the
<hi>Britaines,</hi> againſt thoſe times of aduerſitie which afterward did fall vpon them; for no Army though

and craggineſſe not vnlike to thoſe of <hi>Italy,</hi> all of them towring vp into the Aire, and round encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing

theſe lye mantelled ouer with Snow hard cruſted together, though otherwiſe for their height they
are open and liable both to the Sunne to diſſolue them, and the windes to ouer-ſweepe them.</p>
            <p>(5) The ancient Inhabitants of this Country were the <hi>Ordouices,</hi> of whom we haue ſufficiently
ſpoken in the deſcription of the former Prouinces; neither need I inſiſt either vpon the pleaſures or

and great pitie it is, that ſo famous a worke ſhould not be perpetuous, or euer become the ruine of

the firſt, built a new Towne at the Riuers mouth, termed thereupon <hi>Aber-Conwey:</hi> (that is) the
mouth of <hi>Conwey,</hi> which being formerly fortified by <hi>Hugh</hi> of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> and ſtrongly ſituate and fenced

if it were more populous and traffiqued with Inhabitants Neither muſt I here forget <hi>Newin,</hi> though

CHAPTER I.</head>
            <p>SCOTLAND, the ſecond Kingdome of <hi>Great Britaine,</hi> and the North part of the Iland,
hath on the Eaſt the <hi>Germane Ocean,</hi> on the North, the <hi>Orkneys,</hi> and <hi>Deucalidon Sea,</hi> the Weſt
affronted with <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the South hath the Riuer <hi>Tweed,</hi> the <hi>Cheuiot Hils,</hi> and the adiacent
Tract, reaching to the <hi>Sulway</hi> Sands, whereby it is ſeparated from <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(2) This Kingdome is faire and ſpacious, and from theſe South-borders ſpreadeth it ſelfe
wide into the Eaſt and Weſt, till againe it contracts it ſelfe narrower vnto the Northerne Promon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories:
furniſhed with all things befitting a famous Kingdome; both for Ayre and Soyle, Riuers,
Woods, Mountaines, Fiſh, Fowle, and Cattle, and Corne ſo plenteous, that it ſupplyeth therewith
other Countryes in their want. The people thereof are of good feature, ſtrong of body, and of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious
minde, and in warres ſo venturous, that ſcarce any ſeruice of note hath beene performed,
but that they were with the firſt and laſt in the field. Their Nobilitie and Gentry are very ſtudious
of learning, and all ciuill knowledge; for which end they not onely frequent the three Vniuerſities
of their owne Kingdome (S. <hi>Andrewes, Glaſco,</hi> and <hi>Edenbrough,</hi> the Nurſeries of Pietie, and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of the ſacred <hi>Muſes)</hi> but alſo much addict themſelues to trauell into forraine Countries.</p>
            <p>(3) The Counties contained in this Kingdome are many, and euery where beſtrewed with Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
Towne, and Borrowes, as is that of <hi>England:</hi> and, as <hi>England,</hi> I entended to deſcribe it, had I

and gone through the greateſt difficulties thereof; to build vpon whoſe foundations, I hold it
iniurious: and am ſo farre from any ambition to preuent his noble purpoſes, that I heartily with all

added to the perfecting of the <hi>Theatre of Britaines glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(4) Yet, in the meane while, leſt I ſhould ſeeme too difectiue in my intendments, let me with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
offence (in this third, though ſhort Booke) giue onely a generall view of that Kingdome, vpon
obſeruations from others; which to accompliſh by mine owne ſuruey (if others ſhould hap to faile,
and my crazy-aged-body will giue leaue) is my chiefe deſire; knowing the Iland furniſhed with
many worthy remembrances, appertaining both vnto them and vs, whom God now hath ſet vnder
one Crowne: and the rather, for that their more Southerne people are from the ſame Originall
with vs the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> being both alike the <hi>Saxon</hi> branches: as alſo, that the <hi>Picts</hi> anciently inhabiting
part of that Kingdome, were the inborne <hi>Britaines,</hi> and ſuch as thither fled to auoid the <hi>Romane</hi> ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude:
whoſe names began firſt to be diſtinguiſhed vnder <hi>Diocleſian</hi> the Emperour, when they were
termed <hi>Picts</hi> for painting their bodies, like the <hi>Britaines,</hi> as ſuch <hi>Flauius Vigetius:</hi> which is more
ſtrengthened, for that the Northerne <hi>Britaines</hi> conuerted by Saint <hi>Columb,</hi> are called <hi>Britaine
Picts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(5) But the <hi>Highland-men</hi> (the naturall <hi>Scot</hi> indeed) are ſuppoſed to deſcend from the <hi>Scythi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
who with the <hi>Getes</hi> infeſting <hi>Ireland,</hi> left both their Iſſue there, and their manners, apparant in

CHAPTER I.</head>
            <p>THe Traditions of time haue deliuered vnto vs diuers names, whereby this famous Iland is
recorded to haue beene called: yet none of more faire probabilitie, then that of <hi>Orpheus, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle</hi>
and <hi>Claudian,</hi> by whom it is named <hi>Ierna:</hi> by <hi>Iuuenal</hi> and <hi>Mela</hi> called <hi>Iuuerna:</hi> by <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus
Siculus, Iris:</hi> by <hi>Martian</hi> of <hi>Heraclea, Ioyepnia:</hi> by <hi>Euſtachius, Oyernia,</hi> and <hi>Bernia</hi> by
the natiue Inhabitants, <hi>Eryn:</hi> by the <hi>Britaines, Yuerdon:</hi> the <hi>Welſh-Bards</hi> in their Ballads,
<hi>Tiruolas Totidanan,</hi> and <hi>Banno:</hi> and by the <hi>Engliſh, Ireland.</hi> But from whence theſe diuerſities were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued,
ariſe many opinions. Doubtleſſe it is, that <hi>Hibernia, Iuuerna,</hi> and <hi>Ouernia,</hi> came from <hi>Ierna,</hi>
ſpoken of by <hi>O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the terme that the Inhabitants now vſe. From this <hi>Erin</hi> therefore (a word proper to the Nation)
the originall is moſt likely to be deduced.</p>

               <hi>Ierne,</hi> and the Riuer next vnto it, by <hi>Mela, Ierna:</hi> yea, and <hi>Spaine</hi> it ſelfe, for the Weſterne ſituation,

from their poſition haue their names. <hi>Poſtelius</hi> (a man that rather followed his owne fancy, then
the iudgement of others) fetcheth the originall of <hi>Ireland</hi> from the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> as if <hi>Irin</hi> ſhould be as
much as <hi>Iurin,</hi> that is, the <hi>Iewes</hi> land: which opinion I hold no better then thoſe that would haue it
from the Winter-like ſtormes, although vpon euery winde the aire is cold there.</p>
            <p>(3) <hi>Feſtus Auienus,</hi> in that little booke which he entituled <hi>Ora maritima</hi> calleth <hi>Ireland, Sacram
Inſulam,</hi> that is, the holy Iland: to which opinion the people are ſoone drawne, by reaſon of the
many Saints that the Iland is ſaid to produce, and the bleſſed ſoile that affords no venomous crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
to retaine life. It is thought that <hi>Plutarch</hi> meant <hi>Ireland</hi> by his <hi>Ogygia,</hi> for her great antiquitie;
and of latter times by <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſidore</hi> and <hi>Bede</hi> it was called <hi>Scots</hi> of thoſe <hi>Scots</hi> that inhabited it: and that
thence the name of <hi>Scotland,</hi> together with the <hi>Scots</hi> themſelues, came into <hi>Britaine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(4) For largeneſſe and circuit, in times paſt, this Iland challenged the third place in ranke of
all the Iles of the then knowne world: for thus haue Geographers left vs, that the <hi>Indian Taproba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </hi>
for greatneſſe was the firſt, the Ile of <hi>Britaine</hi> the next, and this of <hi>Ireland</hi> the third: and for that cauſe
doth <hi>Ptolemy</hi> call it the little <hi>Britaine.</hi> But how ſoeuer <hi>Strabo</hi> hath extended the bredth, as broad as
the length, and others haue formed it in ſhape like an egge, yet latter dimenſions haue found it farre
otherwiſe, twice longer then broad, and may be compared to the forelegge of a Beare, if the <hi>Si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

vſe the words of <hi>Giraldus, It is of all Countries moſt temperate, neither forcing the Inhabitants to ſeeke
ſhade from the frying heat of Cancer, nor the chilling cold of Capricorne to driue them to the fire:</hi> but at all
ſeaſons moſt milde, betwixt a ſufferable cold, and gentle warme heat.</p>
            <p>(6) The ſoile (ſaith <hi>Cambrenſis)</hi> is vneuen, wooddy, wilde, wateriſh and boggy, ſo full of Loghs
and Meeres, that great ponds of water are found vpon the high Mountaines. Theſe indeed make the
places ſomewhat dangerous vnto all new commers, by breeding of rheums dyſſenteries and fluxes,
whoſe vſuall remedie is <hi>Vskebah,</hi> a wholeſome <hi>Aqua vita,</hi> that drieth more, and enflameth leſſe,

            <p>(7) The Commodities of this Kingdome chiefly conſiſt in Cattle, whoſe feed is ſo ſweet and ſo
ranke, that they will ſoone graze to a ſurfet, if they may be ſuffered to feed as they will. Their ſheepe
are many, but beare not the beſt wooll, which twice are ſhorne within one yeare. Of theſe they make
Mantles, Caddowes, and Couerle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Snake or venomous creatures; and to ſpeake all in a word, nothing wanting for profit or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure:
for ſo much doth <hi>Giraldus</hi> affirme, in ſaying, that <hi>Nature had caſt into this Weſterne Kingdome of

in enmitie implacable.</hi> At the baptizing of their Infants, their manner was, not to dip their right armes
into the water, that ſo (as they thought) they might giue a more deepe and incurable blow; neuer
calling them by the names of their Parents whileſt they liued together, but at their death tooke it
vpon them. Their women nurſed not the children they bare; and they that nurſed others, did affect

their neighbours fire vpon <hi>May-day:</hi> to eat an old egge, endangered the death of their horſe: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they caſt in their ſeed, they ſend ſalt into the field: to hang vp the ſhelles in the roofe, was a
preſeruatiue of the chickens from the kite: to ſet vp greene boughes at their doores in the Moneth
of May, increaſed their kines milke; and to ſpit vpon Cattle, they held it good againſt Witchery,
whereof <hi>Ireland</hi> was full.</p>
            <p>(17) Superſtitious Idolatry among the wilde <hi>Iriſh</hi> was common, yeelding diuine honour vnto
the Moone after the change, vnto whom they both bowed their knees, and made ſupplications; and
with a loud voice would thus ſpeake vnto that Planet: <hi>Wee pray thee leaue vs in as good eſtate as thou
foundſt vs.</hi> Wolues they did make their Godſibs, terming them <hi>Chari Chriſt,</hi> and ſo thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
preſerued from their hurts: the hoofes of dead horſes they accounted and held ſacred: about
childrens necks they hung the beginning of Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> Goſpell, a crooked naile of an horſe-ſhooe,
or a peece of a Wolues skinne; and both the ſucking-childe and nurſe were girt with girdles finely
plated of womans haire; ſo farre they wandred into the wayes of errour, in making theſe armes the
ſtrength of their healths.</p>
            <p>(18) Their wiues were many, by reaſon of diuorcements, and their maids married at twelue
<pb facs="tcp:3363:183"/>
yeares of age, whoſe cuſtomes were to ſend to their louers, bracelets plated, and curiouſly wrought of
their owne haire; ſo farre following <hi>Venus</hi> in the knots of theſe a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

ſhirts exceedingly large, ſtained with Saffron, the ſleeues wide, and hanging to their knees, ſtrait and
ſhort truſtes plated thicke in the skirts, their breeches cloſe to the thighes, a ſhort skeine hanging
point downe before, and a mantle moſt times caſt ouer their heads. The women wore their haire
plated in curious manner, hanging downe their backes and ſhoulders, from vnder ſoulden wreathes
of fine linnen, rolled about their heads, rather loading the wearer, then delighting the beholder:
for as the one was moſt ſeemely, ſo the other was vnſightly: their neckes were hung with chaines
and carkaneths, their armes wreathed with many bracelets, and ouer their ſide-garments the ſhagge
rugge mantles purfled with a deepe Fringe of diuers colours, both ſexes accounting idleneſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the common Souldier but lightly armed, who ſerued with darts and ſharpe skeines; their
Trumpet was a Bagge-pipe, and word for encounter, <hi>Pharroh;</hi> which at the firſt onſet with great

from thence to his home.</p>
            <p>(20) For the dying and dead they hired women to mourne, who expoſtulated with the ſicke,
why he would die; and dead, at his Funerall ſuch out-cries were made, ſuch clapping of hands, ſuch
howlings, and geſtures, that one would thinke their ſorrowes vnrecouerable, holding the opinion
of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> for the ſoules departed.</p>
            <p>(21) Their dyet in neceſſitie was ſlender, feeding vpon water-creſſes, rootes, muſhromes, ſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogh,
butter tempered with oat-meale, milke, whey, yea, and raw fleſh, the bloud being cruſhed out:

(5) The generall Commodities of this Prouince, are Corne, Cattle, Wood, Wooll, and Fiſh.
The laſt whereof, it affords in euery place plenty &amp; abundance of all ſorts. But none ſo well knowne
for the ſtore of Herrings that are taken there, as is the Promontory called <hi>Eraugh,</hi> that lies betweene
<hi>Bantre</hi> and <hi>Ballatimore</hi> Bay, whereunto euery yeare a great Fleet of <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Portugals</hi> reſort
(euen in the middeſt of Winter) to fiſh alſo for Cods.</p>
            <p>(6) The principall Citie of the Prouince is <hi>Limericke,</hi> which the <hi>Iriſh</hi> call <hi>Loumeagh,</hi> compaſſed
about with the famous Riuer <hi>Shennon,</hi> by the parting of the Channell. This is a Biſhops See, and the
very Mart-Towne of <hi>Mounſter.</hi> It was firſt wonne by <hi>Reymond le Groſſe</hi> an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> afterwards
burnt by <hi>Duncnald</hi> an <hi>Iriſh</hi> petty King of <hi>Thuetmond.</hi> Then in proceſſe of time, <hi>Philip Breos</hi> an <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhman</hi>
was infeoffed in it, and King <hi>Iohn</hi> fortified it with a Caſtle, which he cauſed therein to be
built. In this Caſtle certaine Hoſtages making their abode in the yeare 1332 grew (as is reported)
ſo full of pride and inſolency, that they flew the Conſtable thereof, and ſeized the Caſtle into their
owne hands. But the reſolute Citizens, that could neither brooke nor beare with ſuch barbareus
crueltie, did in reuenge then ſhew ſuch manly courage and viuacitie, as they ſoone after recouered
the Caſtle againe, repaying the Hoſtages in ſuch hoſtile manner, as that they put them all to the
ſword without partialitie. The poſition of this Towne is by <hi>Mercator</hi> placed for Latitude 53. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
20. minutes; and for Longitude, 9. degrees and 34. minutes. Neere vnto the Riuer that <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemy</hi>

calleth <hi>Corragia,</hi> the <hi>Engliſhmen Corke,</hi> &amp; the natiue Inhabitants of the Country <hi>Coreach.</hi> This Towne
is ſo beſet on euery ſide with neighbouring moleſters, as that they are ſtill conſtrained to keepe
watch and ward, as if there lay continuall ſiege againſt it. The Citizens of this place are all linkt
<pb facs="tcp:3363:186"/>
together in ſome one or other degree of affinitie, for that they dare not match their daughters in
marriage into the Country, but make contracts of matrimony one with another among themſelues.
In this place, that holy and religious man <hi>Briock</hi> is ſaid to haue his birth and breeding, who flouriſhed

be laſt in place, yet is it not leaſt in account, as being the ſecond Citie of all <hi>Ireland,</hi> as well for the
conuenience and commodiouſneſſe of the Hauen, that affords ſuch neceſſary aptitude for trade and
traffique, as alſo for the faithfull loyaltie which it hath alwayes ſhewed to the Imperiall Crowne of
<hi>England:</hi> for euer ſince it was wonne by <hi>Richard</hi> Earle of <hi>Pembrook<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it hath come to paſſe, that Religion hath waxed (with the temporall common ſort) more cold and
feeble, being moſt of them very irreligious, and addicted wholly to ſuperſtitious obſeruations: for in
ſome parts of this Prouince, ſome are of opinion, that certaine men are yearely turned into Wolues,
and made Wolfe-men. Though this hath beene conſtantly affirmed by ſuch as thinke their cenſures
worthy to paſſe for currant and credible; yet let vs ſuppoſe that happily they be poſſeſſed with the
diſeaſe and maladie that the Phyſicians call Lycanthropy, which begetteth and engendreth ſuch like
phantaſies through the malicious humours of Melancholy: and ſo oftentimes men imagine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
<pb facs="tcp:3363:187"/>
to be turned and transformed into formes which they are not. Some againe embrace another
ridiculous opinion, and perſwade themſelues, that he who in the barbarous acclamation and outcry
of the Souldiers, which they vſe with great forcing and ſtraining of their voices, when they ioyne
battaile, doth not howte and make a noiſe as the reſt doe, is ſuddenly caught from the ground, and
carried as it were flying in the ayre, out of any Country of <hi>Ireland,</hi> into ſome deſert vallies, where he

butteth vpon <hi>England,</hi> as <hi>Mounſter</hi> and <hi>Connaught</hi> doe vpon <hi>Spaine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(2) The forme thereof is triangle, and ſides not much vnequall, from her South-Eaſt vnto the
Weſt-point about 80. miles, from thence to her North-Weſt about 70. miles, and her Eaſt Coaſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Sea-ſhore, eightie miles: the circumference vpon two hundred and ſeauentie miles.</p>
            <p>(3) The aire is cleare and gentle, mixt with a temperate diſpoſition, yeelding neither extremitie
of heat or cold, according to the ſeaſonable times of the yeare, and the naturall condition of the
Continent. The ſoile is generally fruitfull, plentifull both in fiſh and fleſh, and in other victuals,
as butter, cheeſe, and mile. It is fertile in Corne, Cattle, and paſture grounds, and would be much
more, if the husbandman did but apply his induſtry, to which he is inuited by the commodiouſneſſe
of the Country. It is well watered with Riuers, and for the moſt part well woodded, except the
Countie of <hi>Diuelin,</hi> which complaines much of that want, being ſo deſtitute of wood, that they are
compelled to vſe a clammie kinde of fat turffe for their fuell, or Sea-coale brought out of <hi>England.</hi>

            <p>(5) The commodities of this Country doe chiefly conſiſt in Cattle, Sea-fowle, and Fiſh. It
breeds many excellent good horſes, called <hi>Iriſh Hobbies,</hi> which haue not the ſame pace that other
horſes haue in their courſe, but a ſoft and round amble, ſetting very eaſily.</p>
            <p>(6) This Country hath in it three Riuers of note, termed in old time the three ſiſters, <hi>Shour,

            <p>(7) Places very dangerous for ſhipping are certaine fiats and ſhallowes in the Sea, that lie ouer

            <p>This Citie in times paſt, for the due adminiſtration of Ciuill Gouernment, had a Prouoſt for the

Boghes, both dangerous, and full of vaporous and foggie miſts.</p>
            <p>(4) This County as it is diuided into ſeuerall portions, ſo is euery portion ſeuerally commended
for the ſoile, according to the ſeaſonable times of the yeare. <hi>Twomond</hi> or the County <hi>Clare,</hi> is ſaid to

both with pleaſure and fertility, abundantly rich in Cattle, Deere, Hawkes, and plenty of Hony.
<hi>Slego</hi> (coaſting vpon the Sea) is a plenteous Country for feeding and raiſing of Cattle. <hi>Le-Trim</hi> (a
place riſing vp throughout with hilles) is ſo full of ranke graſſe and forrage, that (as <hi>Solinus</hi> repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth)
if Cattle were not kept ſometimes from graſing, their fulneſſe would endanger them. And

with meane husbandry and tillage, yeelding plentie of Corne, As euery particular part is thus ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally

many accomodate and fit Bayes, Creekes, and nauigable Riuers, lying vpon her Sea-coaſts, that
after a ſort inuite and prouoke the Inhabitants to nauigation.</p>
            <p>(5) Such as in ancient time made their abode and habitations in this Prouince, were the GAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GANI,
who were alſo called CONCANI, AVTERI, and NAGNATAE. As the <hi>Luceni</hi> (that

was compounded of <hi>Concani</hi> and <hi>Nagnatae.</hi> Howſoeuer, it is ſure that theſe were the ancient Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants

            <p>(6) The principall Citie of this Prouince, and which may worthily be accounted the third in

ſo as they left ſcarce one houſe in the Country vnrifled, or vnraſed; but were bridled and repreſſed
(euen in our remebrance) by the ſeueritie and reſolution of the Commiſſioner of thoſe their

            </p>
            <p>(8) About the yeare 1316. there was ſuch a great ſlaughter made of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> in this Prouince

Church-yards they tooke the dead bodies out of their graues, and in their ſculs boiled the fleſh, and
fed vpon it: yea, and that women did eat their owne children. Thus appeared the ire and anger of

it extends it ſelfe to <hi>Connagh</hi> and <hi>Leinſter;</hi> the Eaſt part lieth vpon the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Sea; and the Weſt
part is continually beaten with the boiſterous rage of the maine Weſt Ocean. This Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince
and furtheſt part of <hi>Ireland,</hi> affronteth the <hi>Scotiſh Ilands,</hi> which are called the <hi>Hebrides,</hi>
and are ſcattered in the Seas betweene both Kingdomes; whoſe Inhabitants at this day is the <hi>Iriſh-Scot,</hi>
ſucceſſour of the old <hi>Scythian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(2) The forme thereof is round, reaching in length from <hi>Coldagh</hi>-Hauen in her North, to <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more</hi>
in her South, neere an hundred miles; and in bredth from <hi>Black-Abbey</hi> in her Eaſt, to <hi>Calebegh</hi>
point in her Weſt, one hundred thirtie and odde miles: The whole in circumference, about foure
hundred and twentie miles.</p>
            <p>(3) This Country ſeldome feeleth any vnſeaſonable extremities, the quicke and flexible windes
cooling the heat of Summer, and ſoft and gentle ſhowers mollifie the hardneſſe of the Winter.
Briefly, the frozen nor torrid Zone haue not here any vſurpation; the clouds in the aire very ſweet
and pleaſant, yea, and when they are moſt impure, are not vnwholeſome, nor of long continuance,
the rough windes holding them in continuall agitation.</p>
            <p>(4) This equall temperature cauſeth the ground to bring forth great ſtore of ſeuerall Trees,
both fit for building, and bearing of fruit; plentifull of graſſe for the feeding of Cattle, and is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly
furniſhed with Horſes, Sheepe and Oxen; the Riuers likewiſe pay double tribute, deepe
enough to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>arry Veſſels either for pleaſure or profit, and Fiſh great ſtore, both for their owne vſes,
<pb facs="tcp:3363:195"/>
and commoditie of others. <hi>Salmons</hi> in ſome Riuers of this County abound more in number then
in any Riuer of <hi>Europe.</hi> To ſpeake (in generall) though in ſome places it be ſomewhat barren,
troubled with <hi>Loughes, Lakes,</hi> and thicke Woods, yet is it euery where freſh, and full of Cattle and
forrage, ready at all times to anſwer the husbandmans paines. But nature is there ſo little behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to Art or Induſtry, that the various ſhew vpon bankes, the ſhady groues, the greene meadowes,
hanging hilles, and fields fit for Corne, (if they were manured) doe ſeeme to be angry with their
Inhabitants for ſuffering all to grow wild and harbarous, through their owne negligence.</p>
            <p>(5) This Country in <hi>Ptolemies</hi> dayes was wholly poſſeſſed by the <hi>Volutij, Darni, Robogdji,</hi> and <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dini,</hi>
who branched and ſpred themſelues into the ſeuerall parts that Iſland.</p>
            <p>(6) The people of this Prouince were accuſtomed in controuerſies and ſolemne proteſtations,
to ſweare by S. <hi>Patrickes Staffe,</hi> which oath they feared more to breake, then if they had ſworne by
the holy <hi>Euangeliſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Their ancient cuſtome in making their King, was this: A white Cow was taken,
which the King muſt kill, and ſeeth the ſame in water whole, then muſt he bathe himſelfe therein
ſtarke naked; and ſitting in the Cawdron wherein it was ſod, accompanied with his people round
about him, he and they vſed to eat the fleſh and drinke the broath wherein he ſate, without cup, or
diſh, or vſe of hand. How farre theſe preſcriptions and cuſtomes were different from the conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of other ciuill Monarchies, we may well perceiue by theſe and other like obſeruations of thoſe
groſſe times, and as yet they are more barbarous then is any other part of the Iſland beſides.</p>
            <p>(7) Hiſtorians relating of <hi>Ireland,</hi> tell of ſeuerall Iſlands in the ſeuerall Prouinces: ſome full of
Angels, ſome full of Deuils; ſome for male onely, ſome for female; ſome where none may liue,
ſome where none can die; and ſuch effects of trees, ſtones, and waters, that a man (but of eaſie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit)
may well eſteeme them as heedleſſe as vncertaine. So alſo S. <hi>Patrickes</hi> Purgatorie (a thing of

S. <hi>Malachy</hi> is famouſed, who firſt prohibited Prieſts marriage in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and (as S. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith,
who wrote his life at large) borrowed no more of the natiue barbarouſneſſe of that Country, then
