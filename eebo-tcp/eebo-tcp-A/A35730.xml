            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Ay it please your Honour. In that which is so serious as Religion I dare not be a trifler: nor can I love a man that is so. <hi>Divinity</hi> is ever Grave, neither toying nor yet sullen. <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Gravity</hi> are twin sisters, both descended from above, owning their high birth from the supreme Sanctity and soveraigne Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty of <hi>Heaven.</hi> As they come from high, so they descend lowe, even to the center of a Man; and take possession of his heart: there they dwell, and from thence they send forth, (like Rivers from their Spring-head) many notable assurances of their residence there. While that some vent <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity</hi> and <hi>Wickednesses</hi> because they have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Religion no deeper then into their braine. Many men are Christians according to a certaine

common since they have of Religion. Now in the Braine of man, <hi>The common Sence</hi> and the <hi>Phantasie</hi> are neere neighbors, hard is the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (and yet the condition) of some, with whom <hi>Phansy</hi> leades the way.</p>
            <p>These <hi>Brain-Christians,</hi> are so much in skill, that they forget Practice. With the head a man may know, even unto others wonder, and his owne pride: But <hi>with the heart a man beleeveth</hi>

            <p>If after this, you finde me wittingly false in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny assertion, or in any authority which I shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, your Lordship hath here (I have sent it) wherewith to stop shame into my mouth.

            <p>When this old Souldier had often pretended much valor to encounter any man that I should bring; and had almost perswaded me into an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of his Ability: At last, in neere two yeeres time being pressed by me, he concluded, plainely, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

discourse with none. Some <hi>were married.</hi> I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook for ene unmarried! Others were skilled in the <hi>Easterne languages!</hi> I undertooke that no word should be instanced, but English and Latine. Then <hi>it was dangerous!</hi> I undertooke that also upon my owne head. Lastly, it was <hi>to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose!</hi> And indeed I found it to no purpose to presse him farther. <hi>Quo fronte! quâ fide! with what forehead</hi> he made these darings, <hi>with what faith</hi> he hath performed them, I well remember, and can justifie: Herein he is guilty of much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth.</p>
            <p>Yet lest he might seeme to have a guilty cause, as well as a pretensed valour, his pen was ready a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all men, and he offered me the choice to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe unto him, upon what particular subject hee should write. I answered him, that I was so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident and so assured of the Truth and goodnesse of our Religion, that I gave him liberty in all the latitude of Controversies betwixt us, to make his owne choice; even there where he thought himself ablest, and the best provided: onely desiring that he would be curious to pick out his best arguments, and that he would be briefe. He promised a speedy discharge, and made his present election to prove Saint <hi>Peters</hi> supremacy: I said I was glad he had
<pb facs="tcp:50626:4"/>
pitched on a point so materiall, but (said I) you have taken one as difficult for you to prove as I could wish. It is now a twelve-moneth since, yet hath this man herein been as mute as death. Is he not guilty of another untruth?</p>
            <p>I am little at leisure, and the least of any in skill for these <hi>Eristicke</hi> discourses: but I serve <hi>Truth,</hi> and that will prevaile. I do therefore againe and againe exact and challenge him to performe his undertaking in that subject, and with that brevity as was promised.</p>
            <p>In the meane time having perused foure severall Treatises of his writing, two in print, and two un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pen, I have good cause to aske, How well he can justifie what I finde in them; not in the whole Treatises (they are not of such weight and worth) but in foure passages taken severally, one out of each Treatise. Nor will I pick out that which is sleight and easie: Nor will I take lesse then what I finde concerning one entire passage and the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular subject there handled.</p>
            <p>The Reasons why I am bold to present the trouble hereof unto your Lordships hand are few, yet enough to exact this of mee. Foure they are, and very powerfull with me. <hi>Duty, Gratitude, Good manners,</hi> and <hi>Piety.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:50626:5"/>

            </p>
            <p>This first motive leades me fairely on unto my second, which is <hi>Gratitude</hi> to your Lordship in whose Noble Person, and deare love, his Lordship now lives, more then in all the world beside. Your Favours, great and many, all free and noble, like your selfe, have obliged me to this <hi>Gratitude.</hi> And among many other, the many earnest and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate wishes, zealously and prayer-like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, for my embracing that Religion, which your Lordship hath with strong beliefe for true, lodged in your owne soule, though in truth, to the great hazard of that excellent soule. An high ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligement as it is: and able from a duller spirit then mine, to extort this <hi>Gratitude.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the next place <hi>Good-manners</hi> have impel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led me hereunto.

A behaviour strange to mis-report those for your owne, whom you have tryed and found impossible for you to move. Impossible for you!

This tryall shall be fairely made, by calling you forth to justifie some passages of yours which I shall make choice to question.</p>
            <p>Foure Treatises of yours, I have hastily coursed over, Two in Manuscript, Two in print. You may be sorry if I finde <hi>Fraude</hi> in the first, <hi>Folly</hi> in the second, <hi>Rayling</hi> in the third, and <hi>Blasphemy</hi> in the fourth. If there be lesse, I am much mistaken. These passages which I meane, are first concerning <hi>Altars</hi> in the tenth Chapter of your <hi>Caveat for a friend,</hi> a Manuscript you sent me, wherein you corrupt one Text and mis-inferre two other. The second in another Manuscript, by you sent, entituled, <hi>A Tract of Prayer to Saints:</hi> where your eighteenth and last Chapter, is so farre from wisedome, learning and Reason, that no one of all your Proofes alledged, are wise enough to finde the way to the Marke you aime at. The third is said to be printed at <hi>Roan 1623,</hi> and by you inscribed <hi>Jesus, Maria Joseph.</hi> This you gave me, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I finde most foule, base, and absurd language, and that both causelesse and untrue. Lastly, in your <hi>Appeale unto King JAMES,</hi> printed (under the name of <hi>John Hunt) 1620</hi> I finde <hi>Blasphemy,</hi> or else I know not <hi>Blasphemy</hi> when I heare it. If I make these things appeare, what are you? and what is your Religion? If I faile, you may show mee the shame of my silly undertaking.</p>
            <p>The Treatises being yours, my speech will be particularly directed to your selfe: yet not so much to your person as unto the language which I finde.</p>
            <p>In the last place you have by way of <hi>Epiphonema,</hi> that which you did lately brave me unto, but afterward as poorely did fly from: I meane three propositions which being made good with solide

Truth, and full proofe, I have promised to become a Papist: but you refused them the other day being (I suppose) conscious to your selfe, either of your owne weakenesse, or of theirs.</p>
            <p>If these propositions cannot be maintained by you nor for you: then reforme your selfe: Reduce them whom you have mis-led. Give God the glory, and doe not scorn the Truth of his advice, who it in him that is <hi>Truth</hi> it selfe,</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Efore the perusall of this short Treatise, I intreat my friendly Reader, to take notice of this preamble.</p>
            <p>The Motives inducing me to write these following sheets, being (as by themselves it will appear) sudden, and after the purpose once entertained, the work (not worth the name of work) as suddenly peformed, I sent them) accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the date) in an Epistolary way to a noble personage to be surveyed by a Priest styling to himself <hi>Anonymus Eremita.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:50626:8"/>
The Reasons hereof are in my two fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Letters expressed, whereunto (without further circumstance) I referre.</p>
            <p>At the latter end of <hi>Iuly</hi> last, I had from the Priest, that which he called <hi>an answer:</hi> upon perusall whereof, I found the old man <hi>Verbosum &amp; delirum.</hi> I found his labour to be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and himself <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. I presently did snatch a pen, and began to presse a short reply to his tedious answer: But two warrantable reasons have delayed my reply, and a third for the present, hath quite diverted it.</p>
            <p>First, I had then upon my hand an answer to be discharged to another of his infectious tribe: But a man (indeed) whose abilities, and whose modesty of Language do yet seem to be of a much better temper, then this <hi>namelesse Hermite</hi> hath discovered. The due dispatch of this, did justly foreslow my reply to this dull <hi>Carmelite.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Immediately upon, or before that <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer</hi> issued from me, it pleased the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey to honour me with their trust unto this Parliament. So that being now
<pb facs="tcp:50626:8"/>
divided from my Library, and not daring (in point of honesty) to withdraw my self from these services (for it is duty better shewn, with weaknesse to undergo my part, rather then deceitfully to desert them) I have held it fit to lay by that reply which I can not now intend, and which must of necessity be fruitlesse in being made unto his, so rude and so barren answer. These two reasons do (as I conceive) just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly warrant my delay.</p>
            <p>Whilst thus I am necessitated, a judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and true friend, upon sight of the wretched, and despicable babling, in the rescript of <hi>Anonymus,</hi> gave me this advice. That the Priests answer being worthy of nothing but contempt, and being too tedious for a present reply, (especially in the middest of better avocations) I should publish this <hi>Quadrilogus</hi> which I formerly sent unto him, and thereby provoke him to thrust forth his elegant answer: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the world (without more lines) may judge on which side <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty</hi> do dwell.</p>
            <p>I have followed this Counsell: Here is
<pb facs="tcp:50626:9"/>
my adventure in way of challenge, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that he should be at charge to publish his own answer, and then (presuming on better leisure) I hope in a reply upon his babling, to shew that the Poets contempt will be a just Encomion for this old Fryer,</p>

               <p>But notwithstanding that you would pull down holy Scriptures from the Bench, yet learned men on your side, do hold them there, whether you like thereof or not.

An Altar properly so called, is never erected, but for sacrifices properly so called.</hi> Now you pretending that your Sacrifices are proper Sacrifices must contend for Altars properly so called. The nature of Relatives is such that as Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice &amp; Altar, do in generall relate each to other: so of necessity, if one be proper the other must be proper: if one improper the other improper also. If then you prove not the propriety of your Sacrifice, you are gone for your Altar: and if you prove not your erroneous transubstantiation, you are gone from your proper Sacrifice. But you have not gone this way, and therefore I will not strive to refute you this way. But briefly meet and close with you upon this Text alledged: which Text if it prove an Altar properly so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the cause is yours: and I will yeild my self to Rome. If this Text do not prove it for you, nor any other: Do you give glory to God, and submit unto <hi>our Iudge.</hi>

                  <hi>Secondly.</hi> To come to my second sort of proofes <note place="margin">§ 5.</note> and withall to shew you what Altar is here meant: I do affirm, that no one, or not above one of the holy Fathers in the pure primitive Church hath interpreted this, or any other place, to a materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all proper Altar: But do constantly and generally teach and expresse themselves that our Altar and our Sacrifices now are Rationall, Spirituall, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charisticall, Invisible, &amp;c. All which shall appear in their own words and language. Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> (on the 50. <hi>Psal.) Sacrificium, id est, confessio ex ore peccatoris: oblatio, hoc est laudatio.—Altare, Fides.—Vitulum laudes.—Victimas; scilicet ut me ipsum offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram. Sacrifice, that is to say, Confession from the mouth of a sinner: Oblation, that is Lauding.—An Altar,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50626:16"/>
Faith—the Galvas Praise.—Victimes, as much as to say, that I offer up my self.</hi> And again (upon the 25. <hi>Psal.) Vnusquisque Sanctus, Altare Domini in se habet, quod est Fides. Every Holy man hath an Altar of the Lord in himself, which is Faith.</hi> And a third time (on the 9. of Saint <hi>Mark) Altare Dei, est cor bonorum; hostiae &amp; Sacrificia, bona opera fidelium. The Altar of God, is the Heart of good men: Hoasts and Sacrifices, are the good works of the Faithfull.</hi>

               <p>By this time it appears seasonable for me to use the words of your own Doctor <hi>Triple-cord.</hi> (§. 5.) <hi>All sides agree, that it is most impious to corrupt the words, or true sence of Scripture, by adding, or substracting, mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>translating, or false interpreting.</hi> But you appear guilty of mistranslating, and of corrupting the sence of Scripture, <hi>Ergo,</hi> All sides, &amp;c. It further appeareth that (setting aside the fraud of your word <hi>Hoast)</hi> this Text doth not speak of Sacrifice but of gifts: of Gifts brought by the people, not offered, for the offering is stayed: the words of our Saviour are plain: who stops the offering thus—<hi>If thou bring thy gift, &amp;c.—and there, &amp;c.—go—and then come and offer:</hi> Not as your Rhemist (and you worse then they). <hi>If thou offer—go—and then come and offer, &amp;c.</hi> Which can hardly be made a sensible period.</p>
               <p>I have an old Manuscript that concurreth very well herein: it is of this Gospel by Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> (written before the Bible was divided into Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: together with a brief commentary thereon, where the word <hi>relinque ibi munus,</hi> leave there thy gift, is expounded, <hi>Differ offerre: Deferre to offer:</hi> The meaning is that though thou <hi>bring thy gift,</hi> yet thou may est not <hi>offer thy gift,</hi> because our Saviour commandeth the offering of it, (not the bringing it) to be stayed untill reconcilement first tendred. <hi>And then come and offer thy gift,</hi> as our Saviour saith. So that your text here alleaged, <hi>viz. If thou offer
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:50626:21"/>
thy Hoast,</hi> must be new Englished thus, <hi>If thou bring thy gift.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You saw that from this <hi>Altar</hi> in this Text, you could by no Analogy prove your Romish <hi>Altars,</hi> therefore to draw it nearer to you: you thought good to mend the Text: hoping thereby to gull some English Readers, who finding <hi>Offer Hoast</hi> and <hi>Altar,</hi> all in a breath, a period, might then swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low you <hi>Roman</hi> sence in all. Are these your <hi>Piae fraudes?</hi> light and darknesse: Truth and a lye shall meet together with the same greeting as <hi>Fraud</hi> and <hi>Pietie.</hi> I can not disgest this corrupted Text of yours, untill I have made this expostu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory question to you which I finde in <hi>Athanasius.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Now the Text is freed, make your best use of <note place="margin">§ 10.</note> it. If you would prove the point in controversie, why do you not make your inference upon the Text, and so conclude, and tye it to your cause? here is no such work. You do not look (I hope) that I should make your argument for you! If you do, I can make no more but this. Our Saviour preaching of forgivenesse and brotherly attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon injuries received, biddeth us <hi>Leave our gift before the Altar—and be reconciled.</hi> So doth our Church when in our approach to the holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion we are charged. <hi>If any of us—be in

               <p>If you mark it well, you shall finde the name of <hi>Table</hi> in the first age of Christianity to have the forehand of the word <hi>Altar.</hi> I need not prove this to you, further then by your learned Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall. <hi>Apostoli non utebantur nominibus Sacerdotii, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificii,</hi>

               <p>THe plain stating of the point in controversie, before set down, is answer enough unto this Paragraph. I may confesse all this true, but that

you intend it for an accusation. If then you think it a blame in us, in that you finde indifferently the name of <hi>Table</hi> and <hi>Altar,</hi> (that is <hi>Table</hi> proper, and <hi>Altar</hi> improper) you do in this blame the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for being Protestants, and us for being Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox and Catholike with them.</p>

               </p>
               <p>You tell us that an <hi>Altar</hi> is a proper place of Sacrifice. True, and therein after a sort you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse the state of the question. An <hi>Altar</hi> proper, is the proper place, for proper Sacrifice: and therefore we have no such <hi>Altar</hi> because we have no such Sacrifice. For proof of this (which we grant you) you vouch the Letters aforesaid, but the place you ayme at is, in the reasons after the Letters: and is the fourth reason there in these words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly, the form of an Altar was ordained for the Sacrifices of the Law: and therefore the Altar in Greek is called</hi>

I conclude that you will stay longer then you expect, in purgatory, in spight of all priviledges to your order granted: or else you will never come into that place: because you are so super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious in your <hi>Altars,</hi> and have abused Gods holy Word, to colour your superstition.

Go to your Book again and study the point better: are you lazy, or are you weak, or is your cause ill?

               <p>You shall have <hi>Gregory</hi> for <hi>Gregory,</hi> and that in this very Chapter, an objection by him made, and do you finde his answer there if you can. <hi>Sicut Corporea atque incorporea diversa sunt genere, ita sunt distincta cognitione. As corporeall and incorporeall are of a severall genus, so are they also distinct in knowledge.</hi> How shall these thus distinct know one another, even concerning things done, much more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning thoughts; S. <hi>Gregory</hi> hath not answered for himself: do you undertake it.</p>

The title of his Chapter is <hi>De resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctione, &amp;c.</hi> Of <hi>the Resurrection</hi> to come; not of the present Saints now in Heaven: he speaketh their of our future Beatitude <hi>receptis cum immortalitate corporibus. When our bodies shall be immortall.</hi> And then saith that in that blessed contemplative life, <hi>Ibi ita patebunt singulorum singulis mentes sicut corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libus oculis subjacent facies corporales. Every ones minde to every one, shall there so lye open, as corporall faces are exposed to corporall eyes.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Cap. 13.</note> and you shall finde his opinion clear in this point. <hi>Ibi sunt spiritus defunctorum, ubi non vident quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunque aguntur aut eveniunt ista vita hominibus. The spirits of men departed are there, where they do not see, whatsoever is done, or doth chance to men in this life:</hi> If not what is done, then much lesse what is thought.</p>
               <p>The same Father beginneth his 15. Chapter, of <hi>Care for the dead,</hi> with these words; <hi>Proinde fatendum est, nescire quidem mortuos quid hic agatur.—Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, it is to be confessed, that the dead know not what is done here,</hi>—And so goeth on to declare that the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:50626:28"/>
dead if they know, do know by relation of such as passe by death, from hence unto them. Thus by Saint <hi>Augustines</hi> opinion, the dead see neither thoughts nor actions here below.

So sometime a rabid anger, may make a curre bite out his own Teeth.</p>

            <p>Among Advocates and Disputants it is held odious and absurd, to leave the cause, and inveigh and raile against the persons: But you leaving the cause and our persons also, boldly fly in <hi>Os Coeli</hi> into the face of God.

               <q>I appeal (say you) to your Majesty (meaning King <hi>Iames</hi> of precious memory) well pleased to consider how great injustice it is, to have your ancient Subjects spoiled of their lands, goods, liberty and life, and be condemned as Felons and Traytors, <hi>For that they will not beleeve in such a perjured God.</hi>

I will not deseant upon so foul, so bold impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: I forbear and leave you to the consistory of your own conscience. The repetition of this is so odious, that (I dare say) you are condemned even at home in your own bosome already: at least I would hope so well of you, that you have and do condemn your self: which you must do for this even to hell, or else you can have no true hope for Heaven, and you had need to do it as publikely, as this is which you have heer set forth. If your temper will be hot, yet (as it is <hi>Revel.</hi> 3. 19.) <hi>Be zealous, and repent.</hi>

               <head>Conclusion.</head>
               <p>IN the first of my foure Chapters, I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, <note place="margin">§. 5.</note> how you have disclaimed the holy Scriptures for your judge, honouring us with that indubious character of being the sheep of Christs fould, because we <hi>hear his voice,</hi> whilst you dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valew, deny, and disclaim the authority of his Word.</p>
               <p>Here again, in this last Chapter I finde <hi>our God</hi> (as before <hi>his Word)</hi> disclaimed by you. <hi>(The God of the Protestants</hi> say you, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And then not content divers times to have denyed him for <hi>your God,</hi> you <hi>Blaspheme</hi> him also in horrid and most fearefull Language: Language of that transcendency, and so divelish, that it cannot be beleeved with the Analogy of Gods honour, and due reverenee to his Name, that the divell, and the howling

damned in hell, shall be suffered to belch against the Majesty of Heaven, the names of <hi>uncivill, evill-mannered, perjured God, worse then the god of Clownes, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus have you denyed God in this world, pray you, (and I pray God) that you may by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and amendment, prevent the time when God shall else deny you in the world to come: least that you there finde, that unto <hi>Maledicentibus</hi> there is an <hi>ite, Maledicti.</hi> Go you cursed, will be said to them that curse. For <hi>Blasphemia est maledicentia, &amp;c. Blasphemy is cursing, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Repent, recall your self and others, least you prove <hi>Anonymus</hi> in the Book of Life.</p>
