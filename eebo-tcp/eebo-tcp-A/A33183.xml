            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE Citizens Lamentation FOR THE Lord Chancellor's Loſs of the PURSE.</head>
            <p>LAMENT, oh <hi>London!</hi> Mother of Cities, and let thy Daughters Mourn in Sack-cloth and Aſhes, for thy Son, thy deareſt Son, the Prodigal is over-taken in his Flight; The Lord High Chancellor of <hi>England</hi> turn'd <hi>Tarpolin,</hi> taken napping in a mean Bawdy-Houſe at Wapping. What a Precipiece has he Leapt, from the <hi>Bench</hi> to the <hi>Bar;</hi> who, by our means was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd from the <hi>Bar</hi> to the higheſt <hi>Bench,</hi> in ſo high a Sphere, that nothing but a Gibbet cou'd Exalt him. If ſuch a Fall be the Effects of Pride, that muſt be Inſolence; and how Juſt are the Fates, that the Haughty Judge ſhould now be brought a Criminal, even before that City over which he had ſo lately Inſulted. Who will Proclaim this Wonder in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> or Report it in the <hi>Weſt?</hi> How wou'd thoſe poor Wretches, whom he Hang'd there by Dozens, Lament, if they had but liv'd to ſee this Day? What an after Slaughter was it, when the Duumvirat of Tyrants, <hi>Kirk</hi> and His Lordſhip, went down to Reap the Gleanings of the Bloody Field; whoſe Voice, like a Two-edg'd Sword, deſtroy'd more in cold Blood, than <hi>Abſalom</hi> and all his Hoſt had done before? What thinks your Lordſhip of it now? Can you as eaſily digeſt an Haltar now, as you cou'd then diſgorge them? Oh 'tis a rare ſight to ſee the deploring Wretches hang by Couples, and make Wry-Mouths one at another. Methinks, the Judge and the General wou'd give as good Diverſion; and it would much increaſe the Horror of their Puniſhment, if we cou'd but raiſe the Dead to be Spectators. This is the Nooſe you have both ſo juſtly deſerv'd, which the ungodly Comiſſary ſo narrowly ſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, but into which the Wicked Councellor is ſo juſtly fall'n.</p>
            <p>And is it not a dreadful Fall (my Lords) from the <hi>Chancery-Bench,</hi> to the <hi>Traytors-Bar?</hi> From an Inſulting <hi>Peer,</hi> that Rul'd the <hi>Throne,</hi> to a whining <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner</hi> in the <hi>Tower?</hi> The Privy-Council <hi>Table,</hi> transform'd into a publick <hi>Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold;</hi> The ſoft <hi>Cuſhion,</hi> into an hard <hi>Block;</hi> The Embroider'd <hi>Purſe,</hi> into a Quilted <hi>Capp;</hi> and the Golden <hi>Mace,</hi> into a glittering <hi>Hatchet;</hi> the <hi>Hang-man</hi> your <hi>Charnock.</hi> But he will do you Juſtice: Hark how he begins to Inſult al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in your own Terms; Ho Sir! have I catcht you? You are a Rogue, I know you Sirrah! I ſhall —. But Hang him! Hang him! an Haltar's too good for him, were it not to fulfil his Dream. And I ſhould be loath to ſtain my Axe with his Polluted Blood, if it were not to do the Country good Service.</p>
