            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THat State which would pre≈øerve it ≈øelf from Ruine and De≈øtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is ever to keep its Inhabitants pure and clean from Vice and Debauchery, and their Laws from violation and corruption, as the fir≈øt is a way or means to engage a con≈øcientious obedience and ob≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the ju≈øt and upright Law of God; ≈øo the ≈øecond by rea≈øon of their due execution are the Sinews or Sanctures that bind the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of ≈øuch State in a perpetual Bond of Safety and Tranquility; and its certainly true where either of the≈øe are violated or neglected, the ruin of that State is near at hand. There's no better way to incline the Subjects of any State to Morality and Vertile, then that tho≈øe that ≈øit at the Helme, or have the Government thereof, ≈øhould hold forth clear Examples and Patterns of Piety and Iu≈øtice in their Lives and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; <hi>Regis ad exemplum totus componitur orbis,</hi> ≈øaith the Poet, <hi>The whole World immitate the Example of their King.</hi> And as the Divine Hi≈øtorian <hi>Jo≈øephus</hi> ob≈øerves in his Eccle≈øia≈øtical Hi≈øtory, Fol. <hi>209.

            <p>Which piece of ridiculous Pageantry being over, O yes being made, and Silence commanded, (as truly there was need of it) the Cryer called over the Jury, who when they had an≈øwered to their names, and taken their places, were commanded to look upon the Pri≈øoners at the Bar, the Pri≈øoners were al≈øo required to look upon the Jurors, and make their challenge before they were ≈øworn; the names of the Jury men were, <hi>Thomas Veer, Ed.

            <p n="1">1. That a Jury of twelve men are (and anciently were) the proper Judges of their Neighbours Actions, Mi≈ø-deeds, or Mi≈ø-carriages; which is founded on Rea≈øon &amp; equity, becau≈øe the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60279:9"/>
Neighbourhood is be≈øt acquainted with, and has the mo≈øt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain knowledge both of the Per≈øons and Actions there done and Acted.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Law requiring, that twelve good and hone≈øt men ≈øhould agree as one, before they determine their Neighbour to be guilty, or not guilty of the Fact or Matter charged again≈øt him, ≈øhew us, not onely that the <hi>Fundamental Laws</hi> of this Land have appointed its Inhabitants, mercifull Judges, but al≈øo ≈øuch who ≈øhould be the proper ≈øole and ultimate Judges (in the matters charged again≈øt any man) to acquit or condemn ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Laws, as in their Con≈øciences they ≈øhould find Equitable, Ju≈øt, and Righteous.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The high E≈øteem our Ance≈øtors have ever had of the≈øe twelve Righteous Judges in former Ages, be≈øpeaks the little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard and honour that the <hi>Recorder</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> the <hi>Mayor</hi> and his <hi>Brethren,</hi> have ≈øhewed to their <hi>Predece≈ø≈øors</hi> and <hi>Antiquity;</hi> as al≈øo their low E≈øteem of the <hi>Engli≈øh-mans Liberties,</hi> which in all Ages and Generations have been mo≈øtly pre≈øerved and ≈øecured by weighing mens Actions in the equal Ballance of their <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Honest Neighbours</hi> Judgments.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We may ob≈øerve how little regard this Court has had of the performance of ≈øuch <hi>Oathes,</hi> which they impo≈øe upon men at plea≈øure; for, notwith≈øtanding they had ≈øworn twelve good and lawful men of the City of <hi>London, Well and truly to try, and true deliverance make, between the King and the Pri≈øoners at the Bar:</hi> Yet they refu≈øe and deny the≈øe Jurors to perform that Oath, which they had ≈øo ≈øolemnly taken; manife≈øting to the World that the <hi>Bench</hi> a≈ø≈øumes a Power and Juri≈ødiction equal with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to enforce and ab≈øolve from Oaths and Covenants at their Wills and Plea≈øures.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Its mo≈øt apparent how little this Court minded <note place="margin">20 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. chap. 1.</note> or regarded their own Duty, Oaths, &amp; Commi≈ø≈øion, to do Equal Law and Execution of Right, without re≈øpect to per≈øons, according to the Laws of this Land: For when the Pri≈øoners had given their con≈øent to be tryed, and the Jury had ≈øworn to try; without, and again≈øt the con≈øent of both, or either of them (or any Act done whereby Common Right ≈øhould be denied the Pri≈øoners) or Ju≈øtice to the Jurors) to ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate

them each from other, is ≈øuch a piece of <hi>Tortious Ju≈øtice,</hi> which there is no Law or Cu≈øtom of <hi>England</hi> can or will ju≈øtifie or maintain.</p>
            <p n="6">6.

And ≈øince once in their prudence they thought meet, ju≈øt, and righteous, to check the Author of ≈øuch <hi>Arbitrary Innovations,</hi> as fining of Jurors for their Verdicts, we hope they will take occa≈øion at this time to manife≈øt their care and tenderne≈øs of the People of <hi>England</hi> (who≈øe Repre≈øentatives they are) in bringing the≈øe latter Malefactors to condign pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhment, that for the future Ju≈øtice may run down its proper Channels, &amp; be faithfully executed and equally di≈øpenced accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our <hi>Antient</hi> and <hi>Fundamental Laws,</hi> and the Laudable Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtoms of this our Land.</p>
            <p>Whil≈øt the Recorder thus treated this Jury of the Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> the Sheriffs had ≈øummoned a new Pannel, to appear at Ju≈øtice Hall the 5th of the 7th Moneth; the Pri≈øoners, on whom the former <hi>Jury</hi> had ≈øworn to pa≈øs their Verdicts upon, <hi>viz.

of <hi>London,</hi> the <hi>Mayor</hi> and his <hi>Brethren,</hi> tho≈øe Rights and Priviledges have been denied; tho≈øe <hi>Laws,</hi> and ≈øuch who claim a benefit from them, have been contemned and over-ruled by the Cen≈øures and Judgements which they pa≈ø≈øed upon, and carriages and u≈øages which they practi≈øed toward both Pri≈øoners and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, ≈øo that this con≈øequence will follow.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Although a Jury of good and hone≈øt men ≈øhall be ≈øworn well and truely to Try, and true Deliverance make be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween &amp;c. according to their Evidence, yet if the Verdict that is confirmed by the Oathes of twelve men (agreed together as one) be not congruous to the will and humour of one Per≈øon ≈øitting on the Bench (as the <hi>Recorder)</hi> the≈øe twelve Iudges ≈øhall be Fined, and Impri≈øoned as <hi>perjured Per≈øons,</hi> and as ≈øuch who are guilty of as high <hi>mi≈ødemeanors</hi> as any they came to judge and try.</p>
            <p>Secondly, When twelve good and lawfull men ≈øhall be ≈øo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pannelled and ≈øworn to try &amp;c. and the Pri≈øoners ≈øhall accept of them without Challenge (except after this the Court al≈øo approves of them) the≈øe fir≈øt ≈øworn ≈øhall be impri≈øoned, and another Jury ≈øummoned, and packed together, to ≈øerve and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer the ends of the <hi>Informers</hi> and <hi>Pro≈øecutors,</hi> upon the <hi>Pri≈øoners,</hi> contrary to Law, any U≈øage or Cu≈øtom what≈øoever.</p>
            <p>And now we dare put tho≈øe <hi>Que≈øtions</hi> to be re≈øolved by the very Enemies of the≈øe Pri≈øoners that were ≈øo tryed by that Court, Whether this Bench (and the Sheriffs of <hi>London,</hi> who from the beginning were either Pro≈øecutors or Informers again≈øt the≈øe Pri≈øoners) Fir≈øt, So menacing and threatning and afterwards Fining and Impri≈øoning one Jury.

            <p>The ≈øecond Jury being thus ≈øworn, the Clark of the Peace read over the Indictment again≈øt <hi>Fra. Moor, Richard Mew, Rich.</hi>

               <hi>Mayfeild, Richard Knowlman,</hi> and <hi>Gilbert Hutton;</hi> as al≈øo that again≈øt <hi>Rich.

            <p>The Cryer calling the Witne≈ø≈øes, the Court proceeded to Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. The Pro≈øecutors and Witne≈ø≈øes were one <hi>Whiting</hi> the Beadle of <hi>Bridgeward,</hi> and the re≈øt were the Sheriffs Officers, whom the Mayor had bound over to pro≈øecute the Pri≈øoners: Whence it may be ob≈øerved, That either the Sheriffs them≈øelves, or their Servants, were the Informers in this Work, from which ≈øo many large per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui≈øits have fallen to them, as hereafter ≈øhall be mentioned.</p>
            <p>The Sub≈øtance of the Witne≈ø≈øes Evidence was, <hi>That they ≈øaw the Pri≈øoners in</hi> Grace-Church-Street <hi>in</hi> Whitehart-Court, <hi>among≈øt the A≈ø≈øembly of People there met together, and that they ≈øtayed there till after Proclamation was made, That all per≈øons there pre≈øent ≈øhould depart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Pri≈øoners being asked what they could ≈øay for them≈øelves, they an≈øwered, That they <hi>owned</hi> that they were at <hi>Gratious-≈øtreet,</hi> met together to wor≈øhip the true and living God in Spirit and in Truth, again≈øt which there is no Law: And further ≈øaid, That the <hi>Indictment</hi> con≈øi≈øted of much matter, as meeting with Force and Arms to di≈øturb the Peace, and continuing there Riotou≈øly, Routo≈øly, and Tumultuou≈øly, in contempt of the King and his Laws, and again≈øt the Kings Crown and Dignity, which none of the Witne≈ø≈øes had ≈øworn, therefore they de≈øired to know upon what Law they were Indicted, and that the Law might be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and read to the Jury, that thereby they might know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they had made a Breach of any ju≈øt Law. The Recorder an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwered, That he was not bound to produce the Law, for it was <hi>Lex non ≈øcripta.</hi> Then (replyed) the Pri≈øoners, How ≈øhall the Jury know whether we are guilty of the Breach thereof. Said the Recorder, It is the <hi>Common Law,</hi> which you have bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in your tumultuous A≈ø≈øemblies, and ≈øtaying there after Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations were made to depart. The <hi>Pri≈øoners</hi> objected, That the Indictment alledgeth three ≈øeveral Proclamations were made, when as but one was made that day: Whereupon the Witne≈ø≈øes were again examined, whether there were not three Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made? Who an≈øwered, that there was but one made: Upon which the Mayor demanded of one of the Witne≈ø≈øes, whether O
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60279:13"/>
YES was not ≈øaid thrice? Who an≈øwered, That the Officer who made Proclamation ≈øaid O YES three times, before he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the People in the Kings Name to depart: Then ≈øaid the Mayor, That was three <hi>Proclamations.</hi> Such a piece of Violence in the explanation of a Word, that has not been known in a Court of Ju≈øtice.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Pri≈øoners</hi> further urged, That they were alwayes quiet and peaceable in their A≈ø≈øemblies; That the Law again≈øt Riots were never intended again≈øt them, but <hi>Popi≈øh,</hi> or ≈øuch like Di≈øturbers of the Peace. To which the <hi>Recorder</hi> an≈øwered, That the PAPISTS were better Subjects to the King then they were, and that they were a ≈øtubborn and a dangerous People, <hi>and mu≈øt either be brought under, or there were no ≈øafe living by them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Pri≈øoners offering to vindicate them≈øelves from tho≈øe ≈øoul A≈øper≈øions laid upon them by the Recorder, telling him, That they had broken no ju≈øt Law to their knowledge, and that they never had been guilty of being Rioters and Routers, as was pretended, which they de≈øired the Jury to take notice of, and that there had not any ≈øuch Proof been offered by the Witne≈ø≈øes.</p>
            <p>Whereupon the <hi>Mayor</hi> and <hi>Recorder</hi> commanded the Goalers to thru≈øt them into the Bale-dock, and in their ab≈øence the Recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der gave his Charge to the Jury, not ≈øo much ≈øumming up the Evidence (which truly proved not the tenth part of the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) as giving in matter of his own, of foul <hi>Criminations,</hi> tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Jury that they were a Refractory People, ≈øuch who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in deeds of Darkne≈øs, and that they mu≈øt be cru≈øhed, or there would be no living by them; ≈øo that upon the <hi>Indictment</hi> they mu≈øt find them guilty.</p>
            <p>Now ≈øurely there never was greater Oppre≈ø≈øion and Violence manife≈øted in a Court of Iu≈øtice, either upon the ju≈øt and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Law, or a quiet and peaceable People, as has been acted by the Lievtenancy (its pitty to ≈øay Magi≈øtrates) of the famous City of <hi>London:</hi> Had there been colour for their proceedings by any Statute Law of the Land, pointing out the Offenders and their Puni≈øhment, the≈øe ≈øeveral Actings of theirs might have been in ≈øome mea≈øure tollerable; but when men dare at once, again≈øt the very face of <hi>Law, Ju≈øtice, Equity, Rea≈øon, Right,</hi> and <hi>Liberty,</hi> commit ≈øuch Oppre≈ø≈øions upon their Fellow-Creatures, yea, on

a People too, who never yet could be ju≈øtly charged for u≈øing Violence, Force, or Arms again≈øt any man, no, not ≈øo much as to defend them≈øelves again≈øt ≈øuch, who have violently and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanly abu≈øed and tortured their bodies, without the lea≈øt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of Warrant or Authority from the Civil Magi≈øtrate. We cannot but ≈øtand in admiration of this Court of Iudicature; Let us a little ≈øee the Judgments of our Sages of the Law, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the matter of Riots, in former and latter times, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Statute Law, but al≈øo the Opinion of the Learned.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt ≈øee the Statute of 17 <hi>R.</hi> 2. chap. 8. (1393.) It was Enacted, <q>That the Sheriffs, and all other the Kings Officers, ≈øhould ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øs Rioters, and Impri≈øon them. 13 <hi>H.</hi> 4. chap. 7. <hi>(An.</hi> 1411) If any A≈ø≈øembly or Rout of people again≈øt the Law be made, that three or two Ju≈øtices of the Peace and Sheriff, or under She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs, ≈øhall come with the Power of the County (if need be to arre≈øt them, and ≈øhall record what is done again≈øt the Law; and that the per≈øons by that Record ≈øhall be convict in manner, as inforceable Entries.</q> 2 <hi>H.</hi> 5. 8. <q>The Kings Liege People, that were Travellers, ≈øhould be a≈ø≈øi≈øtant to the Ju≈øtices &amp;c. when warned to ride with them in aide to re≈øi≈øt <hi>Riots, Routs &amp;c.</hi> upon pain of Impri≈øonment.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Riotors</hi> and <hi>Routers,</hi> mentioned in the≈øe Statutes, were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ≈øuch per≈øons, who did really meet with <hi>Force</hi> and <hi>Arms;</hi> el≈øe, what need was there of the Power of the Country, as is directed, to quiet, appea≈øe, and arre≈øt them; or el≈øe, what need of engaging Travellers to re≈øi≈øt them; notwith≈øtanding, they may have the Power of the Country to apprehend them.</p>

            </p>
            <p>So that its mo≈øt plain and evident, That a Quiet, Religious, and Peaceable A≈ø≈øembly of people were never intended by our Predece≈ø≈øors, to be puni≈øhed as Rioters, Routers, and unlawful A≈ø≈øemblies, as our Law-Executioners now a dayes would have it.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Cook</hi> ≈øaid, <hi>Intere≈øt regi habere ≈øubditos pacatos,</hi> That the Kings Intere≈øt was to have his Subjects peaceable. And what mu≈øt it be the inferior Officers Intere≈øt to have them accounted otherwi≈øe, and that for filthy Lucre ≈øake?</p>
            <p>A new Contrivance to advance the Sheriffs perqui≈øi≈øts, which our Fore-fathers were ignorant of, <hi>(viz.)</hi> The Sheriffs to ride to an A≈ø≈øembly of People, whom they, or their Confederates, again≈øt all Law, had forceably kept out of their Hou≈øe and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold; and becau≈øe (upon <hi>Proclamation</hi> by them made, for which they have no Ground or Authority by the Law) the people pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øently departing not from their <hi>own Ground,</hi> and before the Door of their <hi>own Hou≈øe,</hi> they ≈øhall be committed to Goal as Rioters, condemned as ≈øuch, and the Sheriffs ≈øhall have 400. or 500 l. for their dayes work, out of the≈øe Innocent per≈øons Fines.</p>
            <p>This new con≈øtruction of Religious A≈ø≈øemblies ≈øeems the more ≈øtrange, by rea≈øon, there cannot be one Pre≈øident produced to back this up≈øtart Opinion, that Religious Meetings de≈øerve of late years that ignominious term of Riots or Routs.</p>
            <p>So that this ≈øeemly piece of Law, or Wit, mu≈øt be owned to have had its Rice, Spring, and Original, from the prerogative brain of <hi>S. S.</hi> Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> and confirmed by the City Recorder, who doubtle≈øs will not be the la≈øt that may repent of his dayes work.</p>
            <p>The next whom the Court called to their Tryal was <hi>Ezekiel Archer,</hi> and <hi>Margery Fann,</hi> who being indicted for Rioters the Se≈ø≈øions before, and the Evidence being deficient, the Court coveting to come off with credit in all ≈øuch <hi>Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> as were of the new ≈øtamp, ordered an <hi>Indictment</hi> for <hi>Fello<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> to be read again≈øt them, which they had forged and framed

            <p>The ≈øame day this Bench called <hi>T.

N. Grove</hi> and <hi>I. Tillot; Grove</hi> being fir≈øt to give in his Te≈øtimony, declared, <hi>That there was an Indictment drawn again≈øt</hi> S.

R. <hi>would go with him to Mr.</hi> Tanner, <hi>and drink a pint of Wine with him, and draw up a ≈ølight Bill that might not be found.</hi> So (≈øaid the Mayor) here's both the Indictment proved already; which Evidence <hi>Grove</hi> delivered, as being one entire Action and Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øe; and being asked what time this Di≈øcour≈øe was, whether when <hi>T.

Tillot</hi> was next called, who ≈øwore that <hi>T. R.</hi> acknowledged to him, that he had the Indictment. <hi>T. R.</hi> acquainted the Court that he owned that he was at the Se≈ø≈øions at <hi>Guildhall,</hi> where <hi>S. Allingbridge</hi> attending, reque≈øted him to enquire and know from the Clark, whether his <hi>Adver≈øaries</hi> had drawn any Bill of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment again≈øt him, and what the Indictment might be: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>T. R.</hi> enquired of the Clark, whether he had drawn ≈øuch a Bill: <hi>Jo. Forman,</hi> an Officer, ≈øtanding by him, with ≈øeveral Bills in his hand, gave this Bill into <hi>T. R</hi>'s hand to read, which when he had done, in open Court, returned the Bill to <hi>Forman,</hi> and immediatly went out of Court, ordering <hi>S. A.</hi> to ≈øend for his Witne≈øs to try the Indictment, in ca≈øe the grand inque≈øt ≈øhould find it <hi>Billavera.</hi> The Evidence, as it was much contrary to Truth, ≈øo it was as far ≈øhort of proving the Indictments, as by the en≈øuing Exceptions may appear. But what was deficient in that re≈øpect the Recorder made up in his charge to the Jury.</p>

               <head>Exceptions to the Indictment.</head>
               <p>Fir≈øt, It appears not by the Indictment, that the Bill of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment again≈øt <hi>S. Allenbridg</hi> was Conu≈øable to the Court, it being again≈øt the Ju≈øtices Oath to take notice of it before the Grand Inque≈øt had found it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It appears not that the words charged again≈øt <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenbridg</hi> were puni≈øhable by Law; for the Hou≈øe mentioned in the Indictment might be <hi>Vincent</hi>'s dwelling Hou≈øe, ≈øo Burglary to break into it without lawfull Warrant.</p>

               <p>And next, let us ≈øee what the Law ≈øaith for the Fees due to Goalers, The Mirror of <hi>Ju≈øtice,</hi> p. 288. tells us, That its an abu≈øion of the Law, that Pri≈øoners or others for them, to <hi>pay</hi> any thing for their <hi>Entries</hi> into the Goal, or for their <hi>Going-out:</hi> This is the Common Law, there is no Fee due to them by the Common Law. See what the Statutes ≈øay, The Statute of <hi>We≈øtm.</hi> 1. cha. 26. ≈øaith, <q>That no Sheriff, or other Mini≈øter of the King, ≈øhall take Reward for doing their Offices, but what they take of the King, if they do they ≈øhall Suffer double to the party agrieved, and be puni≈øhed at the will of the King.</q> Under this word, <hi>Mini≈øter</hi> of the <hi>King,</hi> are Included <hi>all E≈øcheators, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roners, Goulers, and the like.</hi> See <hi>Cook</hi> 2 In≈øt. fol. 209. affirms. And agreeable is <hi>Stamf. pl. Coron.</hi> 49. Nay by the Statute of 4 <hi>E.</hi> 3. chap. 10. Goalers are to receive <hi>Theeves</hi> and <hi>Fellons,</hi> taking nothing by way of Fees for the receipt of them. So odious is this extortion of Goalers<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> that vety Theeves and Fellons are exempt from payment of Fees.</p>
               <p>And we find in our Law-Books, That no Fees are due to any Officer, Goaler, or Mini≈øter of Ju≈øtice, but only tho≈øe which
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60279:18"/>
are given by act of Parliament; for if a Goaler will pre≈øcribe for any Fees, the Pre≈øciption is void, becau≈øe again≈øt this Act of Parliament, made 3 <hi>E.</hi> 1. being an Act made within time of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, and takes away all manner of pretended Fees before; and we are ≈øure none can be rai≈øed by colour of pre≈øcription ≈øince: and therefore we find by the Books of 8 <hi>E.</hi> 4. fol. 18. <hi>That a Mar≈øhal or Goaler cannot detain any Pri≈øoner after his di≈øcharge from the Court, but only for the Fees of the Court</hi> (the Court being not barred by this Statute of <hi>We≈øtm</hi> 1. aforementioned) <hi>and if he do, he may be indicted for Extortion.</hi> And agreeable to this is the Book of 21. <hi>E.</hi> 7. fol. 16. where among≈øt other things its held for Law, <hi>That if a Goaler or Guardian of a Pri≈øon, takes his Pri≈øoners proper Garment, Cloak, or Money from him, it is a Tre≈øpa≈øs, and the Goal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ≈øhall be an≈øwerable for it:</hi> So that we may undeniably conclude, That there is no Fee at all due to any <hi>Goaler</hi> or <hi>Guardian</hi> of a Pri≈øon from the Pri≈øoner (but what is due unto him by ≈øpecial Act of Parliament.</p>
               <p>And if a Goaler or Guardian of a Pri≈øoner, ≈øhall take any thing as a Fee of his Pri≈øoner, he may and ought to be <hi>Indicted</hi> of <hi>Extortion,</hi> and upon conviction to be removed from his Office; and if his Pri≈øoner, by Con≈øtraint, Menace, or Dures, be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to give him Money, he may recover that Money again≈øt the Goaler again, in an Action of the Ca≈øe at Common Law.</p>

            <p>What Violences and Oppre≈ø≈øions may at the rate of that Courts proceedings (again≈øt the≈øe Pri≈øoners) be committed not only upon the Cittizens of <hi>London,</hi> but upon every Free-man of <hi>England,</hi> are apparent to the Judicious.</p>
            <p>Have not ≈øuch Arbitrary and Illegal Proceedings upon Jurors (the Staff of the <hi>Engli≈øh-man</hi>'s Liberty) been condemned by the Commons of <hi>England,</hi> in Parliament, and declared, <hi>That they were of evil Con≈øequence to the Lives and Liberties of the People,</hi> (which thing the≈øe Pri≈øoners have ≈øadly experienced) <hi>and that they tended to the Introducing of an Arbitrary Government.</hi> Which no Sober Man que≈øtions, yet no ≈øufficient caution to that Court.</p>
