            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THat State which would preſerve it ſelf from Ruine and Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is ever to keep its Inhabitants pure and clean from Vice and Debauchery, and their Laws from violation and corruption, as the firſt is a way or means to engage a conſcientious obedience and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the juſt and upright Law of God; ſo the ſecond by reaſon of their due execution are the Sinews or Sanctures that bind the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of ſuch State in a perpetual Bond of Safety and Tranquility; and its certainly true where either of theſe are violated or neglected, the ruin of that State is near at hand. There's no better way to incline the Subjects of any State to Morality and Vertile, then that thoſe that ſit at the Helme, or have the Government thereof, ſhould hold forth clear Examples and Patterns of Piety and Iuſtice in their Lives and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; <hi>Regis ad exemplum totus componitur orbis,</hi> ſaith the Poet, <hi>The whole World immitate the Example of their King.</hi> And as the Divine Hiſtorian <hi>Joſephus</hi> obſerves in his Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, Fol. <hi>209.

            <p>And next the Princes curious eye over his own perſonal actions, a due heed care and regard is to be had to his Repreſentatives in his Courts of Iuſtice; <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe Iuſtices whom he conſtitutes by his Commiſſion (to hear and determine betwixt him and his People) that they be ſuch who by their due Adminiſtration and faithfull diſpenſing-of the Laws, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Right may be done to all men without reſpect of Perſons.</p>
            <p>But as Vice and Debauchery have devoured and eaten up the Nations practice of Religion, ſcarce leaving us the outſide Shell of profeſſion; ſo hath the corruption of our Laws, and the violation thereof turned back thoſe wholſom Streams of Iuſtice which ſhould naturally ſlow from the uſe of them.</p>
            <p>And that thou <hi>(Reader)</hi> mayſt ſee that thy ſelf art one, who is in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being buried in the ruines of Religion and Piety, as well as thy Civil Rights and Liberties; which are the two Baſis, or Foundations on which thy temporary here, and future well-being hereafter conſiſts and ſtands.

            <p>To which Indictment <hi>T.

            <p>This piece of practice was in open Court, which manifeſts their partiallity and unequal dealings to ſuch whom they conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned before them, to receive Juſtice at their hands: And how little they (who ſate there as Judges) regarded their Oaths, and the duty of that place of ſo great a truſt, is eaſily reſolved, weighing them in the Ballance of Law and Juſtice, Said the learned <hi>Cook</hi> in his 3 Inſt. fol. 29. <q>

            <p>Surely ſuch Language as this was very ill becoming that Court of Juſtice, and eſpecially to proceed from the chief Magiſtrate of this imperial City; its ſaid, He bears the Sword in vain, thats not a Terror to Evil-Doers, and a Praiſe to them that do well: If in this the Mayor of <hi>London</hi> has manifeſted his Chriſtian Behaviour, let him have the Praiſe thereof. A time has been when ſuch an Expreſſion for its Prophanneſs ſhould have merited

a pair of Stoks, or a Whip; and for its Raſhneſs and Violence to be bound to the Good-behaviour.</p>
            <p>But the miſery of our Age is ſuch, That Judgment is turned back, and Juſtice ſtandeth a far of: And he alone who turneth himſelf from evil maketh himſelf a Prey.</p>
            <p>But the under Marſhals and Goalers manifeſting more of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, then to obey the inhumane and unchriſtian command of the Mayor, exerciſed no other violence upon the Priſoners then pulling off their Hats, for which the <hi>Recorder</hi> rebuked them, and bid the Officers put on the Priſoners Hats upon their Heads again, which was no ſooner done, in obedience of the Courts command; but preſently the Clark of the Peace requires every of the Priſoners, in obedience and reverence to the Court to pull off their own Hats, the Priſoners not complying with theſe whimſical humors, ridiculous precepts, and antick acts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, the <hi>Recorder</hi> gives order to the Officers a ſecond time to pull off all their Hats, and ſet Fines upon their Heads, ſome twenty Marks, ſome twenty Nobles, uſing variety of airy expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions againſt, and taunting thoſe Priſoners, whom he ſo illegally fined.</p>
            <p>Which piece of ridiculous Pageantry being over, O yes being made, and Silence commanded, (as truly there was need of it) the Cryer called over the Jury, who when they had anſwered to their names, and taken their places, were commanded to look upon the Priſoners at the Bar, the Priſoners were alſo required to look upon the Jurors, and make their challenge before they were ſworn; the names of the Jury men were, <hi>Thomas Veer, Ed.

So now their Country being thus ſolemnly ſworn to try, and deliver, &amp;c. they were the true and proper.

Inſt. 49.</p>
            <p>And in the 29th Chapter of our great Charter, its ſaid, <hi>No man ſhall be taken, impriſoned, &amp;c. but</hi> per legale Juditium<hi>—by law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Judgment of his equals;</hi> ſhewing that anciently the Jurors were ſole Judges, to pronounce and give judgment againſt their Neighbours, and ſuch whom they had in charge, according unto that <hi>Myrror of Juſtice,</hi> written by <hi>Andrew Horn</hi> in the time of <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. chap. 1. Sect. 3. <q>It was aſſented unto that free Tenants ſhould meet together in the Counties, Hundreds, and the Lords Courts, if they were not eſpecially exempted, to do ſuch Suits, and there judge their Neighbours: </q>Hence we may obſerve, and impartially conclude.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That a Jury of twelve men are (and anciently were) the proper Judges of their Neighbours Actions, Miſ-deeds, or Miſ-carriages; which is founded on Reaſon &amp; equity, becauſe the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60279:9"/>
Neighbourhood is beſt acquainted with, and has the moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain knowledge both of the Perſons and Actions there done and Acted.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Law requiring, that twelve good and honeſt men ſhould agree as one, before they determine their Neighbour to be guilty, or not guilty of the Fact or Matter charged againſt him, ſhew us, not onely that the <hi>Fundamental Laws</hi> of this Land have appointed its Inhabitants, mercifull Judges, but alſo ſuch who ſhould be the proper ſole and ultimate Judges (in the matters charged againſt any man) to acquit or condemn ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Laws, as in their Conſciences they ſhould find Equitable, Juſt, and Righteous.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The high Eſteem our Anceſtors have ever had of theſe twelve Righteous Judges in former Ages, beſpeaks the little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard and honour that the <hi>Recorder</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> the <hi>Mayor</hi> and his <hi>Brethren,</hi> have ſhewed to their <hi>Predeceſſors</hi> and <hi>Antiquity;</hi> as alſo their low Eſteem of the <hi>Engliſh-mans Liberties,</hi> which in all Ages and Generations have been moſtly preſerved and ſecured by weighing mens Actions in the equal Ballance of their <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Honest Neighbours</hi> Judgments.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We may obſerve how little regard this Court has had of the performance of ſuch <hi>Oathes,</hi> which they impoſe upon men at pleaſure; for, notwithſtanding they had ſworn twelve good and lawful men of the City of <hi>London, Well and truly to try, and true deliverance make, between the King and the Priſoners at the Bar:</hi> Yet they refuſe and deny theſe Jurors to perform that Oath, which they had ſo ſolemnly taken; manifeſting to the World that the <hi>Bench</hi> aſſumes a Power and Juriſdiction equal with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to enforce and abſolve from Oaths and Covenants at their Wills and Pleaſures.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Its moſt apparent how little this Court minded <note place="margin">20 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. chap. 1.</note> or regarded their own Duty, Oaths, &amp; Commiſſion, to do Equal Law and Execution of Right, without reſpect to perſons, according to the Laws of this Land: For when the Priſoners had given their conſent to be tryed, and the Jury had ſworn to try; without, and againſt the conſent of both, or either of them (or any Act done whereby Common Right ſhould be denied the Priſoners) or Juſtice to the Jurors) to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60279:10"/>
them each from other, is ſuch a piece of <hi>Tortious Juſtice,</hi> which there is no Law or Cuſtom of <hi>England</hi> can or will juſtifie or maintain.</p>
            <p n="6">6. We cannot but own and acknowledge the <hi>Parliament</hi> of the Commons of <hi>England,</hi> their induſtrious care and prudence to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve our Lives and Liberties from the violence of Uſurpation, and practice of Arbitrary and Illegal Powers over Juries, who are ſworn to try and deliver their Neighbours, according to Evidence of Fact committed. And ſince once in their prudence they thought meet, juſt, and righteous, to check the Author of ſuch <hi>Arbitrary Innovations,</hi> as fining of Jurors for their Verdicts, we hope they will take occaſion at this time to manifeſt their care and tenderneſs of the People of <hi>England</hi> (whoſe Repreſentatives they are) in bringing theſe latter Malefactors to condign pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, that for the future Juſtice may run down its proper Channels, &amp; be faithfully executed and equally diſpenced accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our <hi>Antient</hi> and <hi>Fundamental Laws,</hi> and the Laudable Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms of this our Land.</p>
            <p>Whilſt the Recorder thus treated this Jury of the Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> the Sheriffs had ſummoned a new Pannel, to appear at Juſtice Hall the 5th of the 7th Moneth; the Priſoners, on whom the former <hi>Jury</hi> had ſworn to paſs their Verdicts upon, <hi>viz. John Boulton, William Bayly, Fra, Moor, Tho. Rudyard, &amp;c.</hi> were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led again into Court, in the afternoon, and each of them fined as formerly, twenty Nobles a piece for their Hats. A Preſident or Foundation for ſuch Judgments, Fines, and Amercements, we challenge the Cities Recorder, and the conceitedly learned Mayor, to ſhew or make out to the World by the Laws of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So ſoon as the Recorder had finiſhed or paſſed theſe new ſort of <hi>Judgments,</hi> or rather <hi>Inquiſitory Cenſures</hi> upon or againſt the Priſoners: He puruſed the Pannel of the laſt ſummoned <hi>Jury,</hi> and gave directions to the Clark to call them over, who as it was obſerved, <hi>pickt</hi> here and there ſuch perſons that were judged the moſt likely to anſwer the malicious Ends and horrid Deſigns of that Bench, calling not the Iury-men in order and direct <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

the Iurors, and before they were Sworn to make their Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges.</p>
            <p>So now a ſecond <hi>Jury</hi> was going to be ſworn upon them for the tryal of one ſingle Fact, which was a further manifeſtation of the Courts evil Intentions againſt them, having now neither E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, Juſtice nor Law, for their boundaries or guides, it being ſuch a piece of practice that no Age can paralel.</p>
            <p>Saith the learned <hi>Cook</hi> in his 2 Inſt. 56. <hi>Lex eſt tutiſſima Caſſis:</hi> The Law is the ſafeſt guard to defend the Innocent from Tort and Wrong, which declares, <hi>That</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mag. Cha. <hi>chap.</hi> 29.</note> 
               <hi>Juſtice and Right ſhall be denied to none.</hi> Neither ſhall any man be deſtroyed by any manner of wiſe, on which <hi>Cook</hi> obſerves, <hi>That every Oppreſſion againſt Law</hi>

               <hi>by colour of any uſurped Authority is a kind of Deſtruction:</hi> For ſaith he, <hi>Quando aliquod prohibetur, prohibetur &amp; omne per quod devenitur ad illud.</hi> The Law admits not of the leaſt wrong to be done to any man. Therefore ſaith the ſame Author, <hi>That its tho worſt Oppreſſion which is done by colour of Juſtice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerve then,</hi> 1ſt The Court to ſwear two ſeveral Iuries upon one perſon, to try one and the ſame Cauſe or Fact, upon one and the ſame Indictment; What is it but under diſguiſe of Iuſtice to commit ſuch Abſurdities, that our Laws allow not, or Lawyers ever before heard of.</p>
            <p>2d If ſuch Practiſes as theſe be allowable, what perſon ſhall know when that Iury, whom the Court will permit to try him, is or ſhall be ſworn upon him, to acquit or condemn him, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his Fact, and the Law of the Land?</p>
            <p>3d What Right and Iuſtice can a Priſoner expect, when his Adverſary, ſhall not only ſummon what Iurors they pleaſe, but alſo in the Court pack together ſuch, whom they Judge will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer their <hi>Malitious Deſigns</hi> upon thoſe who ſhall be committed to their charge.</p>
            <p>The Priſoners taking notice of the Courts partial <hi>Proſecution and unequl diſtribution of Juſtice,</hi> and bold attempts to commit ſuch <hi>horrid Rapes</hi> upon their Liberties, made an unanimous <hi>Proteſtation</hi> againſt the ſecond Iury. Firſt, Deſiring to know by what Law or juſt Preſident they practiſed ſuch ſort of Iuſtice upon them; and how the Recorder could Swear two Iuries to try one and the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60279:11"/>
ſame Fact &amp;c. The Recorder anſwered, <hi>That the firſt Jury was impriſoned for their</hi> Miſdemeanour, (meaning the not finding <hi>W. P.</hi> and <hi>W. M.</hi> guilty) <hi>and the Priſoners muſt take that for an anſwer:</hi> Which being far ſhort of the Queſtion, the Priſoners ſtill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted to know what Law or Cuſtom juſtified their proceedings. The Recorder replyed, <hi>That the Court had over-ruled them:</hi> The <hi>Priſoners</hi> told him, That the Law ſhould be and ought to be the <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Guide</hi> of all Courts of Juſtice, and that ſuch Anſwers as <hi>(The Court over-ruled you)</hi> was not ſufficient to ſatisfie their reaſonable and juſt Demands.</p>
            <p>Whereupon the Recorder, with great Indignation and Rage, told one of the Priſoners, <hi>That he ſhould be Gagged, and deſerved to have his.</hi> Tongue <hi>bored through with a Hot Iron, and his</hi> Mouth <hi>Nail'd to the Duſt;</hi> with many other inveterate, approbious, and tainting Expreſſions, telling him, That he was not bound to produce Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents, but it ſhould ſatisfie, <hi>That the Court was of another Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion againſt them, and had over-ruled them.</hi> To which the Mayor joyned his conſent, ſaying alſo, <hi>We will over-rule you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the Statute 25 <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. chap. 1. it was accorded, <q>That the Kings Juſtices, Sheriffs, Mayors &amp;c. that had the Laws to guide them &amp;c.</q> 
               <hi>This is a Clauſe</hi> (ſaith Cook) <hi>worthy to be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in letters of GOLD, That the Laws are to be the Judges Guides. And therefore not Judges by their Arbitrary Gloſſes, to be Guides of the Laws, which never yet miſguiden any, that truly followed them. Sub Clipeo Legis nemo decipitur,</hi> as ſaith the ſame <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cook</hi> 2 Inſt. 56.</note> Author. <hi>Common Right</hi> in 2 <hi>E.</hi> 3. is called <hi>Common Law</hi> in 14 <hi>E.</hi> 3. &amp;c. and in this ſence it is taken, where it is ſaid, <hi>It a quod ſtet recto in curia,</hi> i. e. <hi>legis in curia, The Law is called</hi> rectum (that is <hi>Right</hi> or a <hi>Rule)</hi> becauſe it diſcovereth that which is tort, crooked, or wrong; ſo as <hi>Right</hi> ſignifieth <hi>Law,</hi> ſo <hi>Tort, Crooked,</hi> or <hi>Wrong</hi> ſignifieth <hi>Injury,</hi> and <hi>Injuria eſt contra jus</hi> againſt Right. <hi>Hereby</hi> (ſaith Cook) <hi>the crooked Cord of that which is called Diſcretion appeareth to be unlawful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that (Firſt) its plain, The Law rules and guides, but Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, Force, and Violence over-rule.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The juſt Judge makes the Law his Rule and Guide, but the Unjuſt over-rules the Law: So that its apparent, that this over-ruling is no other then by Diſcretion (which is tort,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60279:11"/>
crooked, and rough) to oppoſe with violence that Juſtice and Right, which the Laws allow and afford every Free-man of <hi>England;</hi> then there's no defence to be made againſt the <hi>Recorders</hi> over-ruling, that is gone beyond the Laws Rule, to his own over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling Will and Diſcretion.</p>
            <p>The Clark of the Peace, in obedience to the Courts command, proceeds to Swear the ſecond Jury upon the Priſoners, upon which ſome of the Priſoners objected againſt ſeveral of them, as one <hi>Steed</hi> the Fore-man, and ſeveral others: The Recorder de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied they their challenges, telling them ſtill that <hi>the Court over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rul'd them.</hi> And although Judge <hi>Cook</hi> in his 3 Inſt. fol. 27. ſaith, <hi>That the end of Challenge is to have an indifferent Trial, and which is required by Law, and to bar the Party indicted of his lawfull Challenge, is to bar him of a principal concern in his Trial;</hi> yet this <hi>Recorder,</hi> who doth, or ſhould know the Law, and thoſe Rights and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges which it affords the Priſoners (both in the Challenge of the Array of the Pannel, and alſo of the Poles) admitted their <hi>Challenges</hi> to neither, but cried out ſtill, <hi>The Court over-rules you;</hi> that as well the Spectators, as Priſoners, were fully ſatisfied, that the purpoſe and reſolution of the <hi>Bench</hi> was to make them ſubject and ſlaves to their Injuſtice, and moſt Tyrannical Will and Pleaſure, in diſpite of the Laws and that undoubted Right and Liberty, which is the beſt Birth-right the Freeman of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> hath.</p>
            <p>The names of the Jury were <hi>Henry Stead,</hi> Fore-man, <hi>Edward Dermer, Thomas Moſſe, John Aſhborne, Edward Langton, Henry Oſſtly, Edward Hanney, Walter Hungerford, Tho. Pendleton, Robert Twiſord, Rob. Cooper,</hi> and <hi>Daniel Waiton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As its moſt certainly true, that every Freeman of <hi>England</hi> may, and doth challenge the benefit of <hi>Ancient Fundamental Laws</hi> to protect and defend his <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi> againſt violence and oppreſſion, moſt eſpecially that which is contained in the 29th Chapter of the Charter of Liberties, viz. <hi>Not to be taken, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned &amp;c. but by Judgment of his Equals,</hi> (which <hi>Cook</hi> calls in his Expoſition) twelve of his good, and honeſt Neighbours. And to have equal <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Right</hi> done him, according to that Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as by the firſt Statute of 20 <hi>E.</hi> 1. So its as true that by the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corder</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:60279:12"/>
of <hi>London,</hi> the <hi>Mayor</hi> and his <hi>Brethren,</hi> thoſe Rights and Priviledges have been denied; thoſe <hi>Laws,</hi> and ſuch who claim a benefit from them, have been contemned and over-ruled by the Cenſures and Judgements which they paſſed upon, and carriages and uſages which they practiſed toward both Priſoners and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, ſo that this conſequence will follow.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Although a Jury of good and honeſt men ſhall be ſworn well and truely to Try, and true Deliverance make be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween &amp;c. according to their Evidence, yet if the Verdict that is confirmed by the Oathes of twelve men (agreed together as one) be not congruous to the will and humour of one Perſon ſitting on the Bench (as the <hi>Recorder)</hi> theſe twelve Iudges ſhall be Fined, and Impriſoned as <hi>perjured Perſons,</hi> and as ſuch who are guilty of as high <hi>miſdemeanors</hi> as any they came to judge and try.</p>
            <p>Secondly, When twelve good and lawfull men ſhall be ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pannelled and ſworn to try &amp;c. and the Priſoners ſhall accept of them without Challenge (except after this the Court alſo approves of them) theſe firſt ſworn ſhall be impriſoned, and another Jury ſummoned, and packed together, to ſerve and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the ends of the <hi>Informers</hi> and <hi>Proſecutors,</hi> upon the <hi>Priſoners,</hi> contrary to Law, any Uſage or Cuſtom whatſoever.</p>
            <p>And now we dare put thoſe <hi>Queſtions</hi> to be reſolved by the very Enemies of theſe Priſoners that were ſo tryed by that Court, Whether this Bench (and the Sheriffs of <hi>London,</hi> who from the beginning were either Proſecutors or Informers againſt theſe Priſoners) Firſt, So menacing and threatning and afterwards Fining and Impriſoning one Jury. Secondly, Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moning, packing, and enforcing another Jury upon Priſoners, (to try that Fact which a former Jury were ſworn to determine) againſt the Law, Uſages, and Practices of all Courts of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; have not with <hi>Violence oppreſſed</hi> the <hi>Freemen</hi> of this Land, and denied them that <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Right,</hi> which by the <hi>Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Laws</hi> they ought freely to have and enjoy, and which alſo theſe Juſtices (by their Commiſſions, Oathes, and Duty of their Places) ought to allow, <hi>yea or nay?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond Jury being thus ſworn, the Clark of the Peace read over the Indictment againſt <hi>Fra. Moor, Richard Mew, Rich.</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:60279:12"/>
               <hi>Mayfeild, Richard Knowlman,</hi> and <hi>Gilbert Hutton;</hi> as alſo that againſt <hi>Rich. Thornton, Charles Baniſter,</hi> and <hi>Job Boulton</hi> (the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance whereof is before ſet down) and their <hi>Indictments</hi> for form and matter being alike, they were tryed together.</p>
            <p>The Cryer calling the Witneſſes, the Court proceeded to Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. The Proſecutors and Witneſſes were one <hi>Whiting</hi> the Beadle of <hi>Bridgeward,</hi> and the reſt were the Sheriffs Officers, whom the Mayor had bound over to proſecute the Priſoners: Whence it may be obſerved, That either the Sheriffs themſelves, or their Servants, were the Informers in this Work, from which ſo many large per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſits have fallen to them, as hereafter ſhall be mentioned.</p>
            <p>The Subſtance of the Witneſſes Evidence was, <hi>That they ſaw the Priſoners in</hi> Grace-Church-Street <hi>in</hi> Whitehart-Court, <hi>amongſt the Aſſembly of People there met together, and that they ſtayed there till after Proclamation was made, That all perſons there preſent ſhould depart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Priſoners being asked what they could ſay for themſelves, they anſwered, That they <hi>owned</hi> that they were at <hi>Gratious-ſtreet,</hi> met together to worſhip the true and living God in Spirit and in Truth, againſt which there is no Law: And further ſaid, That the <hi>Indictment</hi> conſiſted of much matter, as meeting with Force and Arms to diſturb the Peace, and continuing there Riotouſly, Routoſly, and Tumultuouſly, in contempt of the King and his Laws, and againſt the Kings Crown and Dignity, which none of the Witneſſes had ſworn, therefore they deſired to know upon what Law they were Indicted, and that the Law might be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and read to the Jury, that thereby they might know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they had made a Breach of any juſt Law. The Recorder an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, That he was not bound to produce the Law, for it was <hi>Lex non ſcripta.</hi> Then (replyed) the Priſoners, How ſhall the Jury know whether we are guilty of the Breach thereof. Said the Recorder, It is the <hi>Common Law,</hi> which you have bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in your tumultuous Aſſemblies, and ſtaying there after Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations were made to depart. The <hi>Priſoners</hi> objected, That the Indictment alledgeth three ſeveral Proclamations were made, when as but one was made that day: Whereupon the Witneſſes were again examined, whether there were not three Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made? Who anſwered, that there was but one made: Upon which the Mayor demanded of one of the Witneſſes, whether O
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60279:13"/>
YES was not ſaid thrice? Who anſwered, That the Officer who made Proclamation ſaid O YES three times, before he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the People in the Kings Name to depart: Then ſaid the Mayor, That was three <hi>Proclamations.</hi> Such a piece of Violence in the explanation of a Word, that has not been known in a Court of Juſtice.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Priſoners</hi> further urged, That they were alwayes quiet and peaceable in their Aſſemblies; That the Law againſt Riots were never intended againſt them, but <hi>Popiſh,</hi> or ſuch like Diſturbers of the Peace. To which the <hi>Recorder</hi> anſwered, That the PAPISTS were better Subjects to the King then they were, and that they were a ſtubborn and a dangerous People, <hi>and muſt either be brought under, or there were no ſafe living by them.</hi>

            <p>The Priſoners offering to vindicate themſelves from thoſe ſoul Aſperſions laid upon them by the Recorder, telling him, That they had broken no juſt Law to their knowledge, and that they never had been guilty of being Rioters and Routers, as was pretended, which they deſired the Jury to take notice of, and that there had not any ſuch Proof been offered by the Witneſſes.</p>
            <p>Whereupon the <hi>Mayor</hi> and <hi>Recorder</hi> commanded the Goalers to thruſt them into the Bale-dock, and in their abſence the Recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der gave his Charge to the Jury, not ſo much ſumming up the Evidence (which truly proved not the tenth part of the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) as giving in matter of his own, of foul <hi>Criminations,</hi> tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Jury that they were a Refractory People, ſuch who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in deeds of Darkneſs, and that they muſt be cruſhed, or there would be no living by them; ſo that upon the <hi>Indictment</hi> they muſt find them guilty.</p>
            <p>Now ſurely there never was greater Oppreſſion and Violence manifeſted in a Court of Iuſtice, either upon the juſt and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Law, or a quiet and peaceable People, as has been acted by the Lievtenancy (its pitty to ſay Magiſtrates) of the famous City of <hi>London:</hi> Had there been colour for their proceedings by any Statute Law of the Land, pointing out the Offenders and their Puniſhment, theſe ſeveral Actings of theirs might have been in ſome meaſure tollerable; but when men dare at once, againſt the very face of <hi>Law, Juſtice, Equity, Reaſon, Right,</hi> and <hi>Liberty,</hi> commit ſuch Oppreſſions upon their Fellow-Creatures, yea, on
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60279:13"/>
a People too, who never yet could be juſtly charged for uſing Violence, Force, or Arms againſt any man, no, not ſo much as to defend themſelves againſt ſuch, who have violently and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanly abuſed and tortured their bodies, without the leaſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of Warrant or Authority from the Civil Magiſtrate. We cannot but ſtand in admiration of this Court of Iudicature; Let us a little ſee the Judgments of our Sages of the Law, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the matter of Riots, in former and latter times, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Statute Law, but alſo the Opinion of the Learned.</p>
            <p>Firſt ſee the Statute of 17 <hi>R.</hi> 2. chap. 8. (1393.) It was Enacted, <q>That the Sheriffs, and all other the Kings Officers, ſhould ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Rioters, and Impriſon them. 13 <hi>H.</hi> 4. chap. 7. <hi>(An.</hi> 1411) If any Aſſembly or Rout of people againſt the Law be made, that three or two Juſtices of the Peace and Sheriff, or under She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs, ſhall come with the Power of the County (if need be to arreſt them, and ſhall record what is done againſt the Law; and that the perſons by that Record ſhall be convict in manner, as inforceable Entries.</q> 2 <hi>H.</hi> 5. 8. <q>The Kings Liege People, that were Travellers, ſhould be aſſiſtant to the Juſtices &amp;c. when warned to ride with them in aide to reſiſt <hi>Riots, Routs &amp;c.</hi> upon pain of Impriſonment.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Riotors</hi> and <hi>Routers,</hi> mentioned in theſe Statutes, were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſuch perſons, who did really meet with <hi>Force</hi> and <hi>Arms;</hi> elſe, what need was there of the Power of the Country, as is directed, to quiet, appeaſe, and arreſt them; or elſe, what need of engaging Travellers to reſiſt them; notwithſtanding, they may have the Power of the Country to apprehend them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Read the <hi>Judgment</hi> of the Oracle of our Laws, <hi>Cook</hi> in his 3.

               <hi>An unlawful Aſſembly is when three, or more, aſſemble themſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to commit a Riot or Rout, and do it not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that its moſt plain and evident, That a Quiet, Religious, and Peaceable Aſſembly of people were never intended by our Predeceſſors, to be puniſhed as Rioters, Routers, and unlawful Aſſemblies, as our Law-Executioners now a dayes would have it.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Cook</hi> ſaid, <hi>Intereſt regi habere ſubditos pacatos,</hi> That the Kings Intereſt was to have his Subjects peaceable. And what muſt it be the inferior Officers Intereſt to have them accounted otherwiſe, and that for filthy Lucre ſake?</p>
            <p>A new Contrivance to advance the Sheriffs perquiſiſts, which our Fore-fathers were ignorant of, <hi>(viz.)</hi> The Sheriffs to ride to an Aſſembly of People, whom they, or their Confederates, againſt all Law, had forceably kept out of their Houſe and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold; and becauſe (upon <hi>Proclamation</hi> by them made, for which they have no Ground or Authority by the Law) the people pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently departing not from their <hi>own Ground,</hi> and before the Door of their <hi>own Houſe,</hi> they ſhall be committed to Goal as Rioters, condemned as ſuch, and the Sheriffs ſhall have 400. or 500 l. for their dayes work, out of theſe Innocent perſons Fines.</p>
            <p>This new conſtruction of Religious Aſſemblies ſeems the more ſtrange, by reaſon, there cannot be one Preſident produced to back this upſtart Opinion, that Religious Meetings deſerve of late years that ignominious term of Riots or Routs.</p>
            <p>So that this ſeemly piece of Law, or Wit, muſt be owned to have had its Rice, Spring, and Original, from the prerogative brain of <hi>S. S.</hi> Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> and confirmed by the City Recorder, who doubtleſs will not be the laſt that may repent of his dayes work.</p>
            <p>The next whom the Court called to their Tryal was <hi>Ezekiel Archer,</hi> and <hi>Margery Fann,</hi> who being indicted for Rioters the Seſſions before, and the Evidence being deficient, the Court coveting to come off with credit in all ſuch <hi>Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> as were of the new ſtamp, ordered an <hi>Indictment</hi> for <hi>Fello<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> to be read againſt them, which they had forged and framed
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60279:14"/>
for that purpoſe, and piece of Iniquity, which well deſerves the ſearch and <hi>condign Puniſhment</hi> for the Contrivers; ſo theſe two were found <hi>Not guilty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame day this Bench called <hi>T. Rudyard</hi> into Court; when the Clark had read over the firſt <hi>Indictment,</hi> which the Mayor the former Seſſions declared was not drawn up according to Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Evidence; and alſo the ſecond, which the Mayor ſaid he would ſtand by, and proſecute: The Informers Witneſſes were ſworn, <hi>viz. N. Grove</hi> and <hi>I. Tillot; Grove</hi> being firſt to give in his Teſtimony, declared, <hi>That there was an Indictment drawn againſt</hi> S. Allingbridge, <hi>for ſaying, The firſt man that diſturbed Mr.</hi> Vincent <hi>ſhould never go out of the Houſe alive; and that he ſaw</hi> T. R. <hi>take it out of Mr.</hi> Lees <hi>hand, and told him that it was loſt, and</hi> T. R. <hi>would go with him to Mr.</hi> Tanner, <hi>and drink a pint of Wine with him, and draw up a ſlight Bill that might not be found.</hi> So (ſaid the Mayor) here's both the Indictment proved already; which Evidence <hi>Grove</hi> delivered, as being one entire Action and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; and being asked what time this Diſcourſe was, whether when <hi>T. R.</hi> took the Bill; he anſwered, He did not well know; and <hi>T. R.</hi> asking him ſome further Queſtions, the Mayor inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted him ſaying, He was not to examine the Kings Witneſſes. <hi>I. Tillot</hi> was next called, who ſwore that <hi>T. R.</hi> acknowledged to him, that he had the Indictment. <hi>T. R.</hi> acquainted the Court that he owned that he was at the Seſſions at <hi>Guildhall,</hi> where <hi>S. Allingbridge</hi> attending, requeſted him to enquire and know from the Clark, whether his <hi>Adverſaries</hi> had drawn any Bill of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment againſt him, and what the Indictment might be: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>T. R.</hi> enquired of the Clark, whether he had drawn ſuch a Bill: <hi>Jo. Forman,</hi> an Officer, ſtanding by him, with ſeveral Bills in his hand, gave this Bill into <hi>T. R</hi>'s hand to read, which when he had done, in open Court, returned the Bill to <hi>Forman,</hi> and immediatly went out of Court, ordering <hi>S. A.</hi> to ſend for his Witneſs to try the Indictment, in caſe the grand inqueſt ſhould find it <hi>Billavera.</hi> The Evidence, as it was much contrary to Truth, ſo it was as far ſhort of proving the Indictments, as by the enſuing Exceptions may appear. But what was deficient in that reſpect the Recorder made up in his charge to the Jury.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:60279:15"/>
               <head>Exceptions to the Indictment.</head>
               <p>Firſt, It appears not by the Indictment, that the Bill of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment againſt <hi>S. Allenbridg</hi> was Conuſable to the Court, it being againſt the Juſtices Oath to take notice of it before the Grand Inqueſt had found it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It appears not that the words charged againſt <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenbridg</hi> were puniſhable by Law; for the Houſe mentioned in the Indictment might be <hi>Vincent</hi>'s dwelling Houſe, ſo Burglary to break into it without lawfull Warrant.</p>
               <p>Then, as to the Evidence to the firſt Indictment, 1. No proof that <hi>Grove</hi> ever read the Indictment (which indeed he could not) againſt <hi>S. A.</hi> ſo he ſwore peremtorily upon the Clarks in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, which was a falſe Oath.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That <hi>T. R.</hi> took the Bill out of <hi>Lee</hi>'s hand, could not be, for the Officer keeps the Bills of Indictments, when the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes are ſworn, and not the Clark of the Peace.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Improbable that <hi>Grove</hi> ſhould know that Bill amongſt ſo many more; but impoſſible that he ſhould ſee the Bill taken away (knowing it) and not mention one word of it all that day, no not when the Bill was pretended to be wanting.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Not ſworn he took it out of Court.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Not ſworn that Juſtice, or that any courſe of Law was hindred againſt <hi>S. A.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. As to the <hi>acknowledging</hi> the Indictment to <hi>Tillot,</hi> it was not three hours before the Trial; who asking <hi>T. R.</hi> whether he ever read the Indictment; <hi>T. R.</hi> anſwered, he did, and left it in <hi>Forman</hi>'s hand, why thats enough ſaid <hi>Tillot,</hi> the Mayor ſent for me to ſwear it, which I could not do before.</p>
               <p n="7">7. If <hi>T. R.</hi> had taken the Bill, it could not benefit <hi>S. A.</hi> or hinder the Proſecutor.</p>
               <p n="8">8. That T. R. ſhould hazard his reputation in a thing of no value, wherein he could neither advantage his Friend, nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice his Enemy, could not ſtop the proceedings half an hour, yea in a quarter another might have been written and preferred, is very improbable.</p>
               <p n="9">
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:60279:15"/>
9. Its moſt apparent, that if <hi>Grove</hi> did not perjure himſelf, in ſwearing ſuch a Bill was drawn againſt <hi>S. A.</hi> (he having nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther read it, or had copy of it) he or the Mayor, or ſome of the Confederates muſt themſelves have concealed the Bill, and kept it in their own cuſtody, elſe <hi>N. Grove</hi> could not ſwear to it, one of which muſt neceſſarily be.</p>
               <p>As to the 2d Indictment, the words there pretended to be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, 1. If true, were not adviſing <hi>Grove</hi> to do an Action, but tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him that we would go &amp;c. ſo nothing being done in proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the words it was only diſcourſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Not ſworn that the adviſe was taken.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Improbable that <hi>T. R.</hi> ſhould thus diſcourſe to a Stranger, whom before he had never ſeen.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That he ſhould undertake to go to <hi>Tanner,</hi> that was as much a Stranger to him.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>T. R.</hi> never came afterward to <hi>Grove,</hi> nor ſpoke with <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;</hi> but <hi>S. Allingbridge</hi> was tryed and convicted the very ſame Week, in an Adjournment of the ſame Seſſions.</p>
               <p>Now whether there was either ſufficient Cauſe for an Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. or apparent Proofs to Evidence the Truth of theſe upon which <hi>T. R.</hi> was tryed, or whether all theſe pretented Crimes and Miſdemeanours, were not the product of the Mayors mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, envious, and inveterate ſpirit, cauſleſly carryed on againſt him (who not only appears to be the firſt Informer, but the Maintainer and Proſecutor of the Quarrel, as alſo Evidence and Judge upon) let every unprejudiced perſon (ſeriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering) give his Judgment.</p>
               <p>The Jury was commanded to withdraw, which for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities ſake they did, and not longer ſtaying then about a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an hour, returned again, and brought in the nine perſons that were tryed, guilty in manner and form as they ſtood in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted, which ſome of theſe Jurors had over their Cups ſworn they would do, if ever they come to try the <hi>Quakers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John Boulten</hi> and <hi>William Bayly</hi> were the laſt called to their Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, who were indicted ſeveral, For that <hi>they ſuch a day, and year, and place, with Force and Arms &amp;c. with Two hundred more Perſons, were aſſembled together, to diſturb the Kings Peace; and being ſo aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled,</hi>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:60279:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>they unlawfully took upon themſelves to Preach and Teach to the People; then and there aſſembled and congregated, by reaſon whereof a great concourſe of People did remain together, in contempt of the King and his Laws, to the diſturbance of his Peace, to the terror and diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance of his Subjects, unto the evil example of others, and againſt the Kings Crown and Dignity &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not guilty being pleaded, the Informers Evidence being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, ſwore, That they ſaw or heard them ſpeak or preach to the People, which was ſufficient for the Court to make out the whole Indictments; for the <hi>Recorder</hi> ſaid, the Jury were only Judges of matter of Fact; ſo that if the Jury have Evidence they <hi>Spoke or Preached,</hi> the Court ſayes that muſt be with <hi>Force and Arms, unlawfully and tumulruouſly, to diſturb the Kings Peace, and that Tumults of People were occaſioned thereby, and continued to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, in contempt of the King and his Laws, to the diſturbance of his Peace, terror of his People, evil Example of others, and againſt the Kings Crown and Dignity:</hi> A ready way to perjure Jurors, and oppreſs the Innocent.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the Concomitants of Speaking in the Name of the Living God, and worſhipping him in the Wayes of his own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments: And although the Priſoners deſired to ſee the Law that their Adverſaries pretend they have broken, they ſhall have neither that, nor reaſon produced that might give ſatisfaction either to the Priſoners or Spectators; the Lord <hi>Cook</hi> gave this as a Rule, viz. <hi>Incivile eſt, parte una perſpecta tota re non cognita de ca Judicare;</hi> That it was uncivil, ſeeing only one part, to give Judgment on the whole matter. Yet how little regarded theſe Jury men, or the Court, to know the whole matter before they gave Judgment upon the whole Charge. Surely this Jury was packed to be cut-throats to their own Liberties, and Reputations alſo, or elſe they would have better regarded what they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took; to find guilty every one in manner and ſorm, and yet not the tenth part of any Indictment proved; to be ſworn truely to try, according to Evidence, and yet to find that for which no Evidence was given. Is it poſſible that they ſhould commit this horrid perjury out of a ſlaviſh fear, debaucht principle, and horrid partiallity, and yet be quiet from the terrors of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60279:16"/>
nay, for which we are ſure they cannot free themſelves without ſerious repentance.</p>
               <p>At the cloſe of the <hi>Seſſions</hi> all the Priſoners (who had been found guilty by this Jury of the Benches) were called down to the Seſſions-Houſe, where all day they expected to be called into Court to receive <hi>Judgment,</hi> being prepared alſo to give in their <hi>Exceptions</hi> in Arreſt of Judgment, purpoſed to be delivered to the <hi>Recorder</hi> in writing; but of this expected Defence they were all prevented, the Bench giving their Judgments or Cenſures without calling any of the Priſoners to hear them; the <hi>Tenor</hi> of which, as appears by the <hi>Newgate</hi> Book, are in this manner, <hi>John Bonlton</hi> fined forty Mark, <hi>William Bayly</hi> fined thirty one pound thirteen ſhillings four pence, <hi>William Penn</hi> forty Mark, <hi>Francis Moor</hi> fined twenty Mark, <hi>Richard Mew, Richard Mayfeild, Rich.

And the <hi>Court</hi> gave further Judgments or Cenſures, viz. <hi>Francis Moor, R. M. R M. R. K. G. H. R. T. C. B. I. B. Katherine Everett, I. Boulton,</hi> and <hi>W. Bayly,</hi> fined every of them twenty Marks apiece, and <hi>T. R.</hi> fined a hundred pound, being convict of ſeveral Treſpaſſes and Contempts, and to be committed to Priſon until every of them pay their ſeveral reſpective Fines.</p>
               <p>The Court underſtanding that their Goal of <hi>New-Gate</hi> was ſo full of Priſoners, that there could be no tollerable entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for theſe new Convicts, diſcourſed with the Keepers where to Impriſon them; ſo the Bench having an account, that out of the <hi>Dogg,</hi> by <hi>New-Gate,</hi> that very Seſſions there dyed two perſons of the <hi>Spotted-feaver,</hi> or <hi>Plague,</hi> (one the Maſter of the Houſe, the other a Priſoner, whom <hi>Jo. Robinſon</hi> Alderman had there ſent for refuſing to take an Oath, preſcribed in the 3d of <hi>Ja.)</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they were commanded to be Impriſoned there, and a Keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſet upon them to prevent their going abroad upon the moſt ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent occaſion. Where through the Goodneſs of the Almighty they were preſerved in Health, beyond the expectation of their Friends, or hopes of their Enemies, who doubtleſs out of an
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60279:17"/>
evil end and purpoſe ſent them thither, into an infected houſe.</p>
               <p>But that Goalers, of what degree or ſtate ſoever, may in ſome meaſure know the Duties of their reſpective places, and not through ignorance abuſe ſuch who are committed to their <hi>Charge,</hi> we have thought it meet at this time to inſtance and give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count what their duty is to their priſoners, according to the Laws of this Land, which all Goalers are oblieged under great Penalties to obſerve, and the people of this Land to preſerve, as their Liberties, leaſt by ſuch neglect, ſlavery be inſenſibly drawn upon them.</p>
               <p>By the Common Law we find, <hi>Quod care ad continendos non ad puniendos haberi debet,</hi> as <hi>Bracton</hi> lib. 3. fol. 105. <hi>Goalers are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to hold Priſoners, not to puniſh them.</hi> For Impriſonment by the Law, is (neither ought to be) no more then a bare reſtraint of Liberty, without thoſe illegal and unjuſt Deſtructions of cloſe and open Priſon (as is uſual) See <hi>Stamf.</hi> ple.

               <p>And next, let us ſee what the Law ſaith for the Fees due to Goalers, The Mirror of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> p. 288. tells us, That its an abuſion of the Law, that Priſoners or others for them, to <hi>pay</hi> any thing for their <hi>Entries</hi> into the Goal, or for their <hi>Going-out:</hi> This is the Common Law, there is no Fee due to them by the Common Law. See what the Statutes ſay, The Statute of <hi>Weſtm.</hi> 1. cha. 26. ſaith, <q>That no Sheriff, or other Miniſter of the King, ſhall take Reward for doing their Offices, but what they take of the King, if they do they ſhall Suffer double to the party agrieved, and be puniſhed at the will of the King.</q> Under this word, <hi>Miniſter</hi> of the <hi>King,</hi> are Included <hi>all Eſcheators, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roners, Goulers, and the like.</hi> See <hi>Cook</hi> 2 Inſt. fol. 209. affirms. And agreeable is <hi>Stamf. pl. Coron.</hi> 49. Nay by the Statute of 4 <hi>E.</hi> 3. chap. 10. Goalers are to receive <hi>Theeves</hi> and <hi>Fellons,</hi> taking nothing by way of Fees for the receipt of them. So odious is this extortion of Goalers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that vety Theeves and Fellons are exempt from payment of Fees.</p>
               <p>And we find in our Law-Books, That no Fees are due to any Officer, Goaler, or Miniſter of Juſtice, but only thoſe which
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60279:18"/>
are given by act of Parliament; for if a Goaler will preſcribe for any Fees, the Preſciption is void, becauſe againſt this Act of Parliament, made 3 <hi>E.</hi> 1. being an Act made within time of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, and takes away all manner of pretended Fees before; and we are ſure none can be raiſed by colour of preſcription ſince: and therefore we find by the Books of 8 <hi>E.</hi> 4. fol. 18. <hi>That a Marſhal or Goaler cannot detain any Priſoner after his diſcharge from the Court, but only for the Fees of the Court</hi> (the Court being not barred by this Statute of <hi>Weſtm</hi> 1. aforementioned) <hi>and if he do, he may be indicted for Extortion.</hi> And agreeable to this is the Book of 21. <hi>E.</hi> 7. fol. 16. where amongſt other things its held for Law, <hi>That if a Goaler or Guardian of a Priſon, takes his Priſoners proper Garment, Cloak, or Money from him, it is a Treſpaſs, and the Goal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſhall be anſwerable for it:</hi> So that we may undeniably conclude, That there is no Fee at all due to any <hi>Goaler</hi> or <hi>Guardian</hi> of a Priſon from the Priſoner (but what is due unto him by ſpecial Act of Parliament.</p>
               <p>And if a Goaler or Guardian of a Priſoner, ſhall take any thing as a Fee of his Priſoner, he may and ought to be <hi>Indicted</hi> of <hi>Extortion,</hi> and upon conviction to be removed from his Office; and if his Priſoner, by Conſtraint, Menace, or Dures, be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to give him Money, he may recover that Money againſt the Goaler again, in an Action of the Caſe at Common Law.</p>
               <p>Item, The King Conſidering the great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, Extortion, and Oppreſſion, which be <note place="margin">Stat. 23 <hi>H.</hi> 6. chap. 10.</note> and have been in this Realm by his Sheriffs, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-Sheriffs, and their Clarks, Bailiffs, and Keepers of Priſons &amp;c. hath ordained by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority <note place="margin">Sta. 4 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 5.</note> aforeſaid, in eſchewing all ſuch Extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Perjury, and Oppreſſion, that no Sheriff <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>This is a perfect Account of the Goalers Fees in all Caſes, where perſons are laid in Priſon upon Civil Matters and Cauſes, which Fee of 4 d. is more then any other Statute or Law allows them to take from their Priſoners: But in ſuch Caſes where the King is party, its ſtabliſhed, <q>That the Priſoners in all the Kings Priſons ſhould be maintained at the Kings Charge, and out of the Kings Revenues, according to the old Law of the Land, much leſs to have Money extorted from him by the Goaler.</q> But look into the Priſons in and about the City of <hi>London,</hi> what horrible Oppreſſions, Extortions, and Cruelties, are Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed upon the Free-born People of <hi>England,</hi> yea in moſt Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons throughout this Kingdom.</p>

Court, and audibly declared to them, <hi>That the Recorder told him, That if we</hi> (meaning the Sheriffs) <hi>would give him one of the Fines, he would ſecure us all the reſt of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Surely this was two open and publique a place to make ſuch Bargains as theſe: But what Wonder, when ſcarce any Paſſage or Action of theirs, that Seſſions, was in Law and Righteouſneſs any more juſtifiable: What Ratification or Confirmation of this piece of contracted Bribery has been ſince betwixt them in their private Chambers we know not; but what's done &amp; acted in publique Courts we may &amp; can aſſert, &amp; declare to the World.</p>
               <p>Some may conjecture, That the Money which <hi>I. Howel</hi> the Recorder afterwards received, was upon the firſt propoſed and offered Contract, made in open Court with <hi>Jo. Smith</hi> the Sheriff.</p>
               <p>Others may Imagine, That it was the Mayors Benevolence, for juſtifying his Dirty and Filthy Actions and Proſecutions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the People at the Seſſions. But the caſe is this, That the <hi>Mayor, Sheriffs, Jo. Robinſon &amp;c.</hi> and other the Juſtices for that Seſſions, being met together at <hi>Guildhall</hi> in a Court of Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, propoſed to pay the Recorder for his extrordinary pains, &amp; reward him for his execution of Juſtice, or ſitting in Judgment at the Old-Baily upon the <hi>Quakers: I. Robinſon</hi> the chief of that Flock, and not the backwardeſt to give whats not his own, told the Court, THAT THE RECORDER DESER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VED AN HUNDRED POUNDS FOR HIS SERVICE DONE AT THE OLD BAILY THE LAST SESSIONS. Whereupon the Court conſented to pay him for that ſervice an Hundred Pounds, by the Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin of <hi>London:</hi> Who doubts of the truth hereof are deſired to repair to the <hi>Chamberlins-Office,</hi> and they may there find the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, bearing date the 8th of <hi>October,</hi> 1670. Beſides other Orders for 200 l. more to him, within eight Moneths laſt paſt. An excellent way to eaſe that <hi>Treaſury</hi> of being overburthened with <hi>Orphans</hi> Money, by which <hi>Siniſter Ends</hi> and <hi>Curſed Diſpoſitions</hi> of its <hi>Caſh,</hi> the <hi>Chamber</hi> is run ſo deeply in Debt that its almoſt incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible; and here Modeſty engages to conceal, being in hopes that ere long ſome more ſaithful <hi>Stewards</hi> and <hi>Guardians</hi> may be appointed to have the Charge and Wardſhip of it &amp;c.</p>
               <p>So that notwithſtanding that large proviſion which <hi>Englands</hi>

Laws have made for the ſafety of its Inhabitants (as in chapter 29. of its <hi>Charter</hi> of Liberties <hi>(Nulli vendimus &amp;c.</hi> on which <hi>Cook</hi> obſerves, That all the Kings People, Eccleſiaſtical and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, Free or Bond, Old or Young, yea, although he be Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawed or Excommunicated, or any other without exception, <hi>is to have Juſtice freely without ſale and fully without denial)</hi> yet thoſe Priſoners at the hand of this Recorder and Bench, inſtead of having Juſtice <hi>freely,</hi> have been apparently <hi>ſold</hi> into the hands of their cruel Adverſaries; and inſtead of having it <hi>fully,</hi> they have been unjuſtly <hi>over-ruled</hi> by their Arbitrary and Illegal Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences and Cenſures againſt them.</p>
               <p>Thus are we forced to caſt the blame of the Priſoners Suffrings upon the Authors thereof, which we muſt attribute either ſprung from their falſneſs to their truſt, or their incapacity to execute that weight of Authority committed to them: and ſurely this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion throughout is made ſenſible of nothing more, then the daily Breach of their Liberties, and of Violence to the Freedom of their Perſons and Eſtates, by ſuch <hi>hoſtes humani generis,</hi> as theſe oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Priſoners have had juſt occaſion to complain of.</p>
               <p>The Actions of that Seſſions were a Riddle to the <hi>Engliſh-</hi>man, beyond all that this latter monſtrous Age hath brought forth; its needleſs to repeat how much the publick Liberty (in denying the commonalty that freedom of Iurors the Law allows, fining &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoning Iurors for doing their duty, impoſing Fines arbitrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without inqueſt upon the Freeborn men of <hi>England,</hi> denying to produce that <hi>Law</hi> which is <hi>pretended</hi> to have been <hi>tranſgreſſed)</hi> is wounded, and how much the Injuries are doubled and trebled upon their Fellow-members, and the evil conſequence thereof, which if drawn into preſident, who can count himſelf free ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Perſon or Eſtate. The conſequence of a wicked Sentence (ſaid Chancellor <hi>Bacon)</hi> was infinitely worſe then a wicked Fact, as being held a Preſident and Pattern whereby oppreſſion begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning upon one is extended as warrantable upon all.</p>
               <p>And this concluſion he draweth out of this place of Scripture, <hi>Fons turbatus &amp; vena corrupta eſt juſtus cadens corum impio:</hi> A juſt man falling into the hands of the wicked, is like a Fountain troubled with the Foot, or the Urin corrupted in the Body.</p>

               <p>There appears no other end that this Bench had in this torti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſort of proceeding, then to fill their Sheriffs <hi>Pockets,</hi> with extorted gain, or arbitrarily to puniſh a moſt innocent and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able people, to gratifie their Luſts and Malice.</p>

            <p>THIS impartial Accompt of theſe perſons Tryals, with the Appendix of the Jury-mans Duty and Rights, had been earlier preſented to thy view, but that the difficulty of a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting-Preſs is ſuch (by reaſon of their frequent Searching and Examination) that its no eaſie matter to bring forth Truth to Light without Hazard: As the Author hath on the one hand, avoided the Cenſure of a flattering Hypocrite (that with his Mouth deſtroyeth his Neighbour) ſo on the other hand, the <hi>Laſh</hi> of the Wiſe Man, <hi>Pro.</hi> 24. 24. <hi>He that ſaith unto the Wicked, Thou art Righteous, him ſhall the People Curſe, Nations ſhall Abhor him.</hi>

            <p>What Violences and Oppreſſions may at the rate of that Courts proceedings (againſt theſe Priſoners) be committed not only upon the Cittizens of <hi>London,</hi> but upon every Free-man of <hi>England,</hi> are apparent to the Judicious.</p>
            <p>Have not ſuch Arbitrary and Illegal Proceedings upon Jurors (the Staff of the <hi>Engliſh-man</hi>'s Liberty) been condemned by the Commons of <hi>England,</hi> in Parliament, and declared, <hi>That they were of evil Conſequence to the Lives and Liberties of the People,</hi> (which thing theſe Priſoners have ſadly experienced) <hi>and that they tended to the Introducing of an Arbitrary Government.</hi> Which no Sober Man queſtions, yet no ſufficient caution to that Court.</p>
            <p>O Wicked Times! O Miſerable Age! What, Injuſtice avowed, Oppreſſion become familiar, yea Legal; Oaths of Jurors in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Courts, ſolemnly made and taken in the Preſence of God and man, by a Bench of Juſtice abſolved, or denying them to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form what they had enforced them to Swear?

What's the end theſe perſons aim at, in their Iudicature? Its too apparent, Not <hi>(Salus Populi)</hi> the Commonalties Good: What Religious Perſwaſion do they defend or ſtand for?

               <q>But they uſed the Temple as a Caſtle, and defence for themſelves, againſt the people, and made the Sanctuary a place for them to exerciſe Tyranny in.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Conſider well, and weigh the Actions of <hi>S. Starling, Londons</hi> Mayor; <hi>John Edwards,</hi> and <hi>John Smith,</hi> its Sheriffs, the head and Chieftains of the peoples Oppreſſors, in enforcing their Officers, Sargeants, and Servants, to be Informers and Proſecutors againſt the Innocent, by their Proclamations making peaceable people Riotees, and thereby not only to forfeit their Rights and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; but theſe their Adverſaries aſſuming Authority to demand what part of their Eſtate they ſhall think meet: And judge if theſe practices run not paralel to thoſe of <hi>Albinus</hi> Preſident of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea,</hi> which <hi>Joſephus</hi> thus impartially relates, <q>Who was over all as a Tyrant, and a Prince of Thieves; and he uſed the help of his Guard to Robb the meaner ſort—Nay, he was not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to proclaim it throughout the whole Country, Lawfully for any one that would, to Robb and Steal, ſo that they would bring him a part of their Booty.

            <p>However, too many of the minds and ſpirits of our Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are beſotted, through that deluge of Vice and Debauchery, that has over-ſpread and covered the face of our Land; ſure we are, that the right Noble and Vertuous will ever have a high eſteem of thoſe Laws, that were not only dear to our Anceſtors, but famous throughout the World, for an equal Ballance of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, whereby every mans Right and Liberty might be Weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>Its obſervable what that <hi>Roman</hi> Senator, <hi>C. S.
