            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The First Paradox.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>That no Prince, or State doth gaine, or saue by giuing too small entertainement vnto Souldiers, Officers, or Commaunders Martiall: but doe thereby extreamely loose, and vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably waste their Treasure, besides the dishonour and foiles, that necessarily thereof ensue.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Confesse sparing of Treasure, and all due prouidence for the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation thereof, to bee a thing ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie necessarie, especially in the warres of this our age, where treasure is indeed becom <hi>Neruus Belli</hi>; and therefore by all reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable prouisions to be regarded. But there are in all actions some sparings, or pretence of profit, that are vtterly vnprofitable, fond, and foolish, and woorking effects cleane contrary to that end, for the which such pinching is pretended. As, who seeth not, that, if a husbandman (that hath first allotted a reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable proportion of graine, for euerie Acre of his arable ground) shall (of a couetous minde) abate a quarter, or one third part of his due proportion of seede, thinking thereby to saue somuch; who, (I say) seeth not, that by
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:10245:4"/>
this foolish sauing in the seede, in the crop hee shall loose thrice as much, besides the hurtfull Weeds, that, for want of seede sufficient, grow-vp, and spoile the rest? Or, if a <hi>Merchant,</hi> setting forth his Ship to the seas, fraught with Marchandize, shall know that (to rigge her well, and furnish her with all needfull Tackle, furniture and prouision) it will cost him full 500. pounds: Yet, of a coueteous and greedie minde to saue thereof some 100. pounds, or two, hee shall scant his prouision, wanting perhaps some Cables, Ankers, or other-like necessaries, and after (by a Storme arising) for fault thereof shall loose both Ship and goods. Who will not condemne this miserable foolish Merchant, that (peeuishly to saue one hundred pounds, or two) hath lost both ship and goods, perhaps of 10. times greater value? Much more is the folly of this error in <hi>Martial</hi> causes, where the Tempests are as sodaine, and no lesse perrilous. And therefore such fond sparing, is farre more absurd in these Actions, than in eyther of those, of the <hi>Husbandman</hi> or <hi>Merchant.</hi> For proofe whereof, if I should produce Antique Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples out of the <hi>Romane</hi> and <hi>Graecian Chronicles</hi> of such Kings and Princes, as (by such fond sparing of their Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure) had lost both their Treasure, and their Kingdomes also, I could easily make of this subiect a great volume: but for breuitie sake (leauing many Antiquies) I come to our present age and time, and to matters of our owne Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, and Experience. For who knoweth not, What course the <hi>States</hi> of the <hi>Vnited Prouinces</hi> tooke, for payment of their souldiers, before the arriuall of her <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties Lord Generall,</hi> the Earle of <hi>Leicester.</hi> Who, for spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, or to make (as they pretended) their treasour stretch, did pay their <hi>Bands</hi> after 48. daies to the Moneth, their pay being so scant and bare at 30. onely to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, as it was verie hard for souldiers, or Captaines, to liue honestly vpon it: And the same being now stretched to 48. daies, vtterly impossible for them to liue without
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:10245:4"/>
Frauds in Musters, and pickories, besides on their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey and friends. Hereof it came to passe, that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, and valiantest men retired themselues from the warres, and the worst disposed Free-booters were readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est to enter with these base conditions. For such a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine (as intendeth onely dishonestly, by Fraud and Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berie to enrich himselfe, to the ruine of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey) will especially desire to serue on such base condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as honestly it is impossible for euerie man to liue vpon: And so hauing iust colour thereby to shift, hath all these meanes ensuing infinitely to enrich him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</p>
            <p>First, (in the choise of his officers) to get, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept such Free-booters and Theeues, as (onely to haue the name and priuiledge of a souldier, to es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape the paine due by <hi>Martiall</hi> lawe to such vnsoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dierlike persons) will serue without pay, or with halfe pay.</p>
            <p>Then, euerie of these his officers <hi>Lieutenaunt, Ensigne, Serieants &amp;c.</hi> (being men of that Crewe) will draw in as many also as they can of the same Moulde, to liue on pickorie without pay, and therefore very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to serue in their loose manner with halfe pay. Of such Rakehels then the Captaine hauing rayzed an <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe,</hi> passeth his Muster, and is sent to his Garrison, or place of Seruice.</p>
            <p>Now, the Prince or State that is serued with such as will accept these vnhonest base conditions, is much deceiued, if hee thinke to bee souldierly serued. <hi>Viz.</hi> To haue their <hi>Watches</hi> and <hi>Wardes</hi> strong, vigilant, and carefull: For in steede of one thousand fiue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth souldiers past in Muster, they shall neuer finde fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie on <hi>Guard,</hi> or <hi>Sentinels,</hi> vpon any Round: As all honest <hi>Serieant-Maiors,</hi> and other officers (that haue past their Rounds) can testifie: The rest (if he keepe any more) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eyther abroad in the country at the <hi>Picoree,</hi> or in the

                  </gap>r</hi> his wife or seruants: (for, to drudge in watch or ward the gallantest of this crew disdaine.) If any faults bee complained off, the excuse is readie: Alas their pay is so small, as wee must winke at faults.</p>
            <p>But if at any time the <hi>Commissarie</hi> of <hi>Musters</hi> come with treasure to passe a <hi>Muster,</hi> ye shall euer finde them strong 150. present and absent orderly set downe in <hi>Muster</hi> Rolles. And for their Absents such formall Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monials, Protestations, and oathes, as among Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were horrible to discredit, and their fraudes so ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificially conueyed, as will bee hard to trie: But the treuth is, <hi>Forgery</hi> &amp; <hi>Periury</hi> are the first lessons such Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boters learne, and then <hi>Pallardize, Murder, Treachery,</hi> and <hi>Treason</hi> are their Attendants. Heereof it came to passe (for many yeares together) that after the death of <hi>Don Iohn de Austria,</hi> the <hi>States</hi> lost such a number of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Townes, Forts, Castles and Sconces, yea whole and entier Prouinces reuolted from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by reason of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>extorsions, oppressions, &amp; robberies insolently commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on the Country people, and best Subiects, by these insatiable Cormorants, Lyons to their friends, and Hares in presence of their enemies, hauing not only, <hi>Linguas sed animas venales, manus rapaces, pedes fugaces, &amp; quae honestè nominari non possunt inhonestissima, verè Galeati Lepores et Hyrudines Aerarij.</hi> And this base beggerly pay the onely ground-plot of all these horrible villanies, odious to God and man, and not tollerable in any Christian Gouernment.</p>
            <p>For, if Princes or States will giue such conuenient pay, as men of value, and honesty may sparingly liue-on with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fraud and robbery, they may boldly execute <hi>Martial</hi> discipline, &amp; purge their Army of these idle Drones, and carowsing picking Caterpillers: And in stead of these, they shall (in short time) haue their Ensignes compleat with valiant, honest, sober, loyall souldiers, that shall
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:10245:5"/>
carefully and painefully in watch and ward execute their <hi>Martiall</hi> duties.</p>
            <p>The Earle of <hi>Leicester</hi> with his owne eyes beheld be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Zutphen</hi> campe nigh <hi>Arnhem</hi> two or three Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Scotts and Dutch in the States pay, sent for by Count <hi>Hollock</hi> as the most choise bands that followed him, hauing sixteene or eighteene Ensignes in their Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and paid for nigh three thousand souldiers: That (marching in ranke, and after embattailed) were found not full one thousand, besides their officers.</p>
            <p>Now, if the States had paid truely but 10 Ensignes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter 30. daies to the moneth, (as her Maiestie did) and by <hi>Martiall</hi> discipline haue kept them strong, they should haue had 500. more heads and hands to fight at least in such 10. than in these 18 Ensignes paid after 48. daies. And at the very same time, &amp; the same place his <hi>Excellency</hi> saw eight <hi>English</hi> Ensignes embattailed in the same Field, that for heads of men were more than 16. of the other Ensignes, and for Armes &amp; weapon ful double so strong: And yet these eight Ensignes stood not her Maiesty (pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing honourably) in somuch as the other 18. so dishonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably paid by the States, by many thousand Gilders a moneth.</p>
            <p>Most foolish therefore, and peeuish is such sauing in these <hi>Martiall</hi> causes, being more absurd farre and fond than other of those my first <hi>Examples</hi> of the paltering <hi>Husbandman</hi> or miserable <hi>Merchant</hi> that stumbleth at a straw, and swalloweth a blocke, and by greedie pinching for a penny, fondly looseth or wasteth pounds.</p>
            <p>But that dishonour that falleth out in these actions is much more to bee respected: For, if eight Ensignes (well and truely paid) shall euer bee stronger in all <hi>Martiall</hi> encounters than 18. of the other: how much more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour shall it bee with eight Ensignes to haue performed any honourable action than to haue done the same with eighteene? As contrariwise the foile, to loose eight En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:10245:6"/>
is farre lesse than to loose eighteene.</p>
            <p>Againe, if the <hi>States</hi> had rayzed a meane Army (not of such Mercenarie vagabondes as would serue on any conditions, resoluing by pickorie and extortion to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich themselues) but of temperate, honest, painefull, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant souldiers which full easily with sufficient and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat pay they might haue done, and then haue kept a steddy hand on Martiall discipline, seuerely to haue pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished such cormorants as should any way haue spoyled or extorted on the countrey <hi>Booer,</hi> or honest <hi>Burgher.</hi> They had neuer tasted those horrible Ruines of their townes and desolation of their countries, that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards for many yeares they did. For it was not the great <hi>Subsidies</hi> or <hi>Leuies</hi> made on <hi>Brabant,</hi> and <hi>Flaunders,</hi> and other vpland Prouinces by the <hi>States</hi> vnited that made them all reuolt afterward to the Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi> but onely these abuses, spoiles and pickories. For in <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand</hi> they haue euer since, and doe still leuie as great and farre greater contributions than euer they did on those malconte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted Prouinces: But it was the wrongs, iniuries, Insolencies and Extorsions committed by this crew of degenerate bastardly souldiers or rather picke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s, the seruants or rather idolatrous slaues of their misbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Mistresse Madam <hi>Picorea</hi> that alienated the harts vtterly of these Prouinces. The people hauing reason to reuolt to the gouernment of <hi>Papists</hi> or <hi>Turks</hi> rather than to endure the outrages committed on them, their wiues and daughters by those their owne hirelings so deepely wounding them in wealth and honor. For what Tribute, Subsidie or Taske had not beene farre more tollerable to any honest or Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> people than to haue such a crew of hell-hounds laid vpon them? As, not content to haue the best chambers, beds, and fare that their host could yeeld them; yea wine also bought and farre fet for them, but would enforce them to pay money also, and yet at their parting (in recompence or their good Entertainment)
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:10245:6"/>
rifle them of all that was portable of any value, besides o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indignities not to bee spoken of by honest tongues, or heard by modest eares. The horror of these villaines hath made <hi>Holland</hi> wisely and prouidently these douzen yeares and more yearely to giue ten folde greater contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions (yearly I say respectiuely weighed) than the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Subsidie or beneuolence that euer our Nation gaue during all these 34. yeares of her Maiesties most gracious and happie Reigne. The which they doe most frankly and willingly stil continue to maintaine the warres out of the bowels of their owne country, and to free themselues of those horrible oppressions which they sawe executed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong their Neighbours, which wise Resolution of theirs God hath also so fauoured and blessed with extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie aydes and fauors many waies, as these of <hi>Holland</hi> are not the poorer, but rather much richer than they were before the warres began, Notwithstanding their huge contributions are such, as in commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reason a man would thinke were able to begger any mightie Kingdome: That little countrey of <hi>Holland</hi> onely (being for scope of ground and firme land not comparable with the least of any one of many Shieres in England) yealdeth to the warres yearely a greater contribution than halfe the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Shires of <hi>England</hi> euer yet did in any one yeare by any Subsidie. It is not therefore the great charges or contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions that beggereth or spoyleth any countrey, but the ill disposing of the Treasure leuied, and the ill gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Souldierie therewith maintained, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth indeed more odious and intollerable to any Christian Nation or people farre, than any Tax or Subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die that is possible to bee cessed or imposed on them: Neither is it the multitude of Ensignes that terrifieth the Enemy, but choise election of the Souldiery, and the true execution of Martiall discipline.</p>
            <p>Herof it hath come to passe that so smal handfuls of <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> (while they were wel paid &amp; discipline) did at sondry
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:10245:7"/>
times foile so many Ensignes of these Mercenary Freebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: And contrariwise after those <hi>Spaniards</hi> fell to mute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies (for want of pay) and to committing of like extorsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and insolencies on the Country people, they caused a sodaine reuolt of all the Prouinces.</p>
            <p>But for our owne Nation I holde it a <hi>Maxime</hi> most as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured, and hardly by any one Example, to be disprooued: That euer wee receiued any foile where our Ensignes were compleat, but only in such places, and at such times, as our Ensignes were maintained (not like the eight En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes before mentioned in the Earle of <hi>Leicesters</hi> time in her Maiesties pay) but rather as the other eight in the States pay, as will bee found too too true, if it bee deeply examined.</p>
            <p>The like I say in pay of Officers and superiour Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunders, that to giue them honourable and conuenient entertainment is not onely not vnprofitable, but most profitable and gainefull to any King, Prince, or State: And the contrary (I meane by accepting or admitting such Commaunders or Officers as will offer themselues to serue for small or base entertainment) is a thing vnto the King or State not onely dishonourable, and most hurtfull (in respect of the seuice) but also euen in regard of their Treasure onely most vnprofitable, damageable, and discommodious, as I will prooue by manifest and true reasons.</p>
            <p>But because the Discourse would be ouer-long &amp; tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, if I should particularly enter into the office or charge of euerie seuerall kinde of Officer or Commaunder, I will only choose two, of either sort one, which (to coniecture and discerne of all the rest) may aboundantly suffice to prooue my present <hi>Proposition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Among <hi>Commaunders</hi> therefore I will onely entreate of the <hi>Collonell</hi> or <hi>Maestro del Campo.</hi> And among chiefe <hi>Officers</hi> of the <hi>Comptroller, Censor,</hi> or <hi>Muster Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Generall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:10245:7"/>And first of <hi>Collonels</hi> I say, if they take vpon them that charge to command any conuenient number of Ensignes appropriat to their Regiment, it is fit their entertainment bee proportionall to their reputation and charge: The which as it farre surmounteth a priuate Captain, so ought his allowance to bee accordingly, as wel for maintenance of a conuenient Table, to entertaine the chiefe officers of his regiment. As chiefely such gentlemen of value as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times (without charge or office to see the warres vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their owne priuate expences) will follow him.</p>
            <p>For if this <hi>Collonell,</hi> haue not such entertainment from his Prince or State, hee must of necessitie eyther spoyle or vndoe himselfe to maintaine that port is fit, which fewe in these daies will, or sor remedie helpe himselfe by tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating frauds in Musters, and suffering the Captaines of his Regiment to keepe their bands halfe emptie: Out of the which both Captaines and Coronell may pay them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues double and treble the greatest entertainment that euer any King yet gaue, but not without the very ruine and vtter dishonour of their Nation.</p>
            <p>For what Captaine is there so foolish miserable, (if hee make no conscience to gaine by robbing of his Prince or State;) that will not bee content to giue one halfe of these his foule and corrupt gaines, to enioy the other? Knowing otherwise hee shall not onely quite loose that base gaine, if hee bee called to account for it, but his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation and life also, if Iustice bee duely executed. But if by his chiefe <hi>Collonels</hi> fauour, hee may bee paid for 150. and keepe scarce 60. to defend his Ensigne, and so gaine a thousand pounds a yeare cleare, to giue the moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie yearely thereof to go scot-free with the rest, and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape the shame thereunto due, hee maketh a verie profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table bargaine if such dishonest lucre deserue the name of profit, which course of gaine is so much the more damnable and perrilous to bee suffered, because it vtterly discourageth the honest valiant Captaines, and enricheth
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:10245:8"/>
the contrary: And so tendeth to the verie Ruine and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertherthrow of all true vertue and value.</p>
            <p>For if the chiefe Commaunder bee so affected as hee will bee by any such deuice to supply his wants: In very gratitude and pollicy hee must most countenance those that yeeld him most benefit: And those Captaines may be most beneficiall to him, that (by keeping their Bands most feeble) doe most rob their Prince or State. And so the worst persons (of such Commaunders) must of force bee most fauoured and countenanced.</p>
            <p>Farther these Fauorites if they commit any other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torsions on their Countrimen, Friends, or Allies, being entered into such a <hi>League</hi> with their Commaunders, it is likely they may finde the more Fauour also, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by more boldly by all deuices and extortions rake-in Wealth to maintaine themselues, their Patrones, and Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers in excessiue brauerie.</p>
            <p>Whereas the right valiant Captaine indeed, that (kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping his Band strong and compleat with armed soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, gaining nothing aboue his bare Wages, nor will extort vnhonestly vpon any Friend or Allie, and his wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges (besides his meat and Atmes) scarcely sufficient twice in a yeare to buy him a Sute of Buffe) Remayneth as a Man contemned and disgraced: Where the other by his Robberies and pickories can florish in Monethly change of sutes of silke, dawbed with Embroderies of golde and siluer lace, and Iewels also: And so countenanced by such Commaunders Fauour, and by such other migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Friends as his spoiles may procure.

            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:10245:8"/>But whether these silken, golden, embroydered deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Captaines (with their demy feeble Ensignes) Or the other plaine leather, well armed, sober, painefull, valiant Captaines (with their compleat Ensignes of armed soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers maintained as their companions) shall doo their Prince or Countrey more honour at a day of Seruice? If wee haue not yet learned, wee shall I doubt hereafter, if these abuses bee not reformed, with the dishonourable losse of many more <hi>English</hi> Ensignes, than all the <hi>Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles</hi> these 500. yeares before could tell vs of, to remaine for an vnhonorable monument of these our errors, to all posteritie.</p>
            <p>For I haue euer found it in my experience a Rule almost infallible among priuate Captaines: The more braue and gallant the Captaine is in his apparrell, and Wastfull in Expences, the more poore, feeble, weake and miserable ye shall for the most part finde his souldiers full of lice many times, &amp; stinking for want of a shirt to change the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, when such Commaunders with some few Fauorites are ouer sweete and fine.</p>
            <p>And then is it any Meruaile if so braue and gallant a Gentleman (perfumed perhaps with Muske and Syuet) disdain to haunt the filthy <hi>Corps du gardes</hi> of ragged, loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, lowsie souldiers? Or is it any meruaile then, (where Captains giue this Example:) If Lieutenants &amp; Ensignes also do take their ease, and liuing in like delicacy, disdaine to associate themselues with their poore flocks.</p>
            <p>If Townes of great Importance haue beene lost by the cowardize of some one <hi>Corps du gard,</hi> that beastly haue abandoned without blowes, a ground of such aduantage as was defensible against any Royall Army: Onely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause at the approach therof, there was neither Captaine, Lieutenant nor Ensigne present on the guard, but a knot only of these poore Ghosts: And thereby dishonorably a town of great Importance lost, very experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce (me thinks) should teach vs rather to choose such Captains as would
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:10245:9"/>
so apparrell themselues, and regard their fellow-souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as they should not disdaine their company, or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre their stinke.</p>
            <p>I haue read, that a worthy <hi>Generall</hi> of the <hi>Graecians,</hi> after hee had with a small Army of valiant, rude, plaine, sober, obedient souldiers conquered ten times as many of the rich, silken, golden, riotous perfumed <hi>Persians,</hi> abounding with horses and chariots and Armours of golde, because (quoth hee) the <hi>Persians</hi> were so deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cately and daintily bred, as they were not able to abide the sauor of my souldiers arme-holes.</p>
            <p>I would therefore wish no Captaines chosen but such as should contemne vtterly such feminine delicacy in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell and wastfull riotous expences, and could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to make himselfe a companion of his fellow souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and think his honour consisted (not in gay garments) but in good Armes, in the strength of his band, in his trauels, paines, watchings, and aduentures, and not in c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rowsing or perfuming, or any other delitious, idle, or rather effeminate vnmanly vanitie. For as <hi>Marius</hi> the Romane <hi>Generall</hi> auerred: <hi>Munditias mulieribus, viris laborem conuenire</hi>: So, if Souldiers and Captaines would contend one to excell another therein, (I meane in Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary labours and carefull aduenterous endeauours, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning all delitious pompes and idle ease, as effeminate and vnworthy their professions) then should wee see a great alteration, both of the fortune and fame of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which heeretofore hath euer been comparable with the best and most renowned.</p>
            <p>But the onely or chiefe meanes to bring this to passe, is, first to allow vnto the Generall and chiefe Commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders so honourable and conuenient Entertainment, as may suffice to maintaine the port and honour of their place, without practising or consenting to any corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, especially such as vtterly disgrace the good, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich the bad, deface the painfull, carefull, sober, valiant
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:10245:9"/>
Captaine, and aduance the idle, negligent, riotous coward. But aboue all things to haue him detested more than a coward, that (of a base corrupt minde) shall seeke to make his gaine by keeping his band feeble and weake, and by deceipts, fraud and periuries at Musters to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triue the same: For by this meanes hee doth not onely rob his Princes treasure, but is also guiltie of the bloud of those souldiers that are slaine for want of hands to fight when the honour of their Nation comes to triall.</p>
            <p>As all true Martiall Discipline therefore is not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiued and put in execution among our Nation: So espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that part which concerneth this mightie and grosse abuse (aboue all other) ought most seuerely to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded. And to the end Officers of Musters may by the <hi>Generall</hi> or chiefe Gouernours be countenanced in their honest proceedings (for discouerie and correction of such abhominable frauds and Robberies as so vsually and shamelesly haue beene practized) I would wish their owne particular bands (where they haue any) should al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way bee allowed them without checke, for any default: presuming in honour they would bee the more carefull to bee an example to other, when they shall see them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues by their Prince so trusted. And then hauing lesse cause (in respect of their priuate profit) to fauour any such deceipt in others, there is no doubt, but (hauing also honorable entertainme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t) they will (as they are by a double duty bound) honorably aduance that course of discipline which shall make their Armies victorious, themselues fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, and their Countrey felicious; especially if due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard bee had in the choise of such chiefe and principall <hi>Commaunders,</hi> who ought indeed to bee honorable and not base minded persons.</p>
            <p>And as good trees are not iudged by the blossomes, but by the fruits: So surely are men rather by their deedes than by shewes or partial Fame to be discerned: For, as in all other vocations, so chiefly in the warres by common
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:10245:10"/>
Fame such Commaunders euer shall be most extolled of their Followers, as most content their humors. Now if Captaines humors in this age of corruption, be for the greater part infected or depraued, to make choise yet by common fame or opinion, should be an error exceeding great: For as in the pestilent Feauers &amp; like violent dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases, the <hi>Patient</hi> many times doth farre better like that Phisition which suffereth him to take colde liquors, &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pleasing phancies, agreeable to his appetite, which as very poysons doo cause his death, than such a Phisition as prescribeth a seuere dyet, accompanied with such bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Medicines as only is able to saue his life, and restore his health and strength. And as the error therein were great to choose a Phisition after such sick-mens appetites: so surely for reformation of these Martiall diseases, the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror were no lesse absurd at the beginning, to choose such Generals or chiefe Commaunders by common Fame, or liking of most Captaines. But after Martiall discipline is againe in some good measure restored, &amp; that Captaines begin to detest riotous expences in meate, drinke, and apparell (as effeminate delicacie) and contend who may exceede other in labour, paines, watchings, diligence, and vertuous Martiall Actions, hauing a right taste and sence in deede of true honour and Martiall valour, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the same consisteth, and by some conuenient continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Exercise and vse made the same not greeuous but familiar vnto them: Then were there no more compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Iudges (of the abilitie and sufficiencie of a Generall,) than such, as (aduenturing their lyues with him) haue greatest neede and vse thereof.</p>
            <p>But as that famous Generall and <hi>Censor Cato</hi> at Rome exclamed in his time, The publique had neede of a sharpe and mercilesse Phisition, and a violent purgation: And that therefore they were to choose (not such Commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders as should be gratefull and gracious,) but resolute and seuere: So surely much more in this time and state
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:10245:10"/>
of warres haue wee cause to proclaime such choise, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther great Princes and Magistrates to haue especiall care and regard thereof.</p>
            <p>Now therefore if the <hi>Collonell</hi> or chiefe Commaunder be chosen such an honourable person, as of himselfe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horres deceipt, feare God, contemne gourmandize and quaffing, and other more base and beastly pleasures, or effeminate delicacies, by the example of many worthie Romaine Generals, as also of that famous victorious <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonian</hi> Generall King <hi>Agesilaus,</hi> it shall be easie for him (hauing conuenient and honourable pay) to banish these Monsters out of his Campe or gouernment, as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie for Souldiers professing Armes, &amp; fitter for the pompous rich slaues of <hi>Persia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if contrariwise any chiefe Commaunders be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that will winke at deceipts or fraudes in Musters, and make their profit (as infinitely they may thereby) no wonder if all the inferiour Captaines insolently put the same in execution, and keepe their Counsels and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Consultations how to exploite and execute those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts, and by all vnhonest practises, slaunders, and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, &amp;c, to disgrace any Officer that shall oppose him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe dutifully against it: And so their Bands continued euer feeble, weake, and miserable.</p>
            <p>Or if this Coronell or chiefe Commaunder be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that hath no compassion on the poore priuate Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, nor care to preserue and maintaine their lyues, but rather (respecting how largely he may make his gaine by their deaths (expose them to the Butcherie, yee shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently haue almost all the Captaines regard the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lesse than dogges.</p>
            <p>Or if the <hi>Collonell</hi> or <hi>Generall</hi> (forgetting that right <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> law, that whosoeuer did saue his life by flight in the field, was infamous euer after euen to his graue) doo take so little shame (of running away in the field) as hee will haue for himselfe a horse of swift cariere
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:10245:11"/>
alway in readinesse vpon any daunger to take his leaue: What meruaile if yee haue inferiour Captaines prouided for the like? Yea many times Liuetenants, and Ensignes also? And what is then to bee expected, but dishonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable flight, shame and confusion, whensoeuer they are roundly charged by any souldiers?</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Collonell</hi> or chiefe <hi>Commaunder</hi> bee a man, that (regarding wholy his profit) will winke at the extorsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Captaines, they haue reason to spare him halfe their pay, or all their Imprestes, for that they can full ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily (from the <hi>Booer</hi> or <hi>Burgher</hi> vnder their crushing) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort much more than the greatest pay any Christian King yet gaue, and thereby so enrich themselues with Golde and Iewels, as they haue no reason any more to hazard their life, but to prouide themselues good horses to escape away with their wealth whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>soeuer they shalbe charged: Leauing their souldiers to the slaughter, by whose deaths also there may grow a good <hi>Diuidend,</hi> to bee shared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong such artificial Fugitiues.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Coronels</hi> or chiefe <hi>Commaunders</hi> of their ease, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure or priuate respects holde it no disgrace or shame to bee absent from their Regiments: No meruaile if any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Captains bee readie to follow such discipline also, and consequently all their Fauorites and persons best ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. And then what meruaile if the silly Remnant of the feeble flocke (hauing scarcely Sheepeheard or Sheepeheards Dogge left to take the care and charge of them) become a pray to the Rauening Wolfe, that will not let slip so good an opportunitie.</p>
            <p>But if the Coronell or chiefe Commaunder himselfe be such a one as takes no shame in Field to saue his life by flight: It is not strange that Captaines vnder his charge should imitate his discipline. And then much lesse reason haue priuate souldiers to stand so much vpon their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, or rather to die than turne their face. But if such indeed bee the true profession of a souldier rather to die
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:10245:11"/>
reasolutely in his ranke, than turne his face, or cowardly by flight to saue his life. If this bee the dutie of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest and most priuate souldier, then how much rather is the Captaine, and much more the <hi>Coronell</hi> bound to such an honorable Resolution?</p>
            <p>If in the most honorable and Martiall Nations of the World, Such cowardize in a priuate souldier hath beene noted with perpetuall shame, how much more ought it to bee detested in Captaines? And then <hi>à fortiori</hi> in their Superiors.</p>
            <p>But if by corrupt custome and education in licentious loose warres, such principall persons bee growne so farre past Shame, as not onely to commit these base and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>souldierlike errrors, but also (that most miserable is) in their ordinarie Discourses and banquets amids their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices to <hi>Bacchus</hi> at open Tables to vaunt of these their <hi>Stratagems,</hi> Recounting in how many Encounters, the places where, and when they fled gallantly, and spurred their horses in their <hi>Violent Retreits,</hi> who might runne swiftest: What shall wee say but that such degenerate shamelesse persons might (with much better reason) vant how many <hi>Bastinadoes</hi> they had receiued brauely?</p>
            <p>For surely cowardize in a Man (especially professing Armes) hath euer beene accounted the foulest vice: As Incontinency the greatest dishonestie in a woman. And as an honest woman may fortune by violence to bee ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>used, and yet all her life time after cannot but blush to haue it spoken of: So though an honest man (I meane a valiant man in the Field) by violence and multitude of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies vnhappily should be enforced to turne his face: Yet ashamed should hee bee euer to heare it spoken of. But as that State were horribly wicked where women should aduant openly of their Incontinency: So, despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate is their disease that are so farre past shame to aduant of their cowardize: And miserable that State must needs become, where such impudency should bee tollerable
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:10245:12"/>
for men professing Armes shamelesly to vaunt of their fearefull flights, or as they are termed in their new Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, <hi>Their violent retraitz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But (that most lamentable is) many times it may come to passe, that these impudent Runawaies being escaped (consorting themselues) shal by Rumors, letters, or prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Pamphlets</hi> perhaps sometimes disgrace those valiant men that resolutely died in the place, rather than they would shame themselues, and dishonour their countrey with a cowardly flight. And then such Fugitiues (extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling one another with <hi>Heroicall</hi> names, hauing also by their former pikories store of crowns to purchase friends, by such <hi>Thrasonicall Stratagems</hi>) of the ignorant multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude bee counted gallant souldiers, and fit for newe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments. An error of all other the most daungerous: That (contrarie to all Martiall discipline) that fault that deserueth death or dishonourable disarming vnder a Gallowes, should bee honoured with new imployments, or greater credit.</p>
            <p>But as the disgrace of a few Ringleaders of Runawaies and other corruptions would wonderfully repaire the honour of any Nation: So the tolleration of them, and much more the imploying of them again in new charges by their Example may breed effects most dangerous and fearefull, if in time (by due execution of right Martiall discipline) such weeds bee not eradicate.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> (by due obedience to their Martiall lawes) were become the most mighty and puissant State of all the <hi>Graecians,</hi> which then for Heroical prowesse sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted all the world besides, as by the multitude of their victories on the <hi>Orientall</hi> Nations, and <hi>Asiaticall</hi> migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Empires is apparant: Whose huge Armies and innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable Forces they vanquished in a number of <hi>Battailes</hi> with a very few, but choise, painefull, sober, well trained and disciplined Bands, being accustomed from their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy to trauaile, paines, sobriety, and hardnes. And by
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:10245:12"/>
the same custome and education learned also with all du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to obey their Superiors, Reuerence the Elders, and to feare nothing but shame and infamie: And of all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famies none so great to a man there as cowardize, being by their verie lawes noted with disgrace perpetuall to his death that ran away from his Enemies in the field, or sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued his life by flight: Which fault was held so soule and base, as the very Mothers abhorred and renounced them, yea and some with their owne hands haue killed such of their sons as by flight in the field haue saued their liues, as Traitors to their countrey, and dishonorable to their parentes: Yea they were disgraded from all honour and imployment, marked by shauing of halfe their heades and beards, derided and disdained of all their countrimen, and lawfull for all men to abuse and beat them as seruiceable Slaues. These were the shames ordained for Fugitiues in those warlike Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Whereupon a King of theirs being demanded how it came to passe that the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> so farre ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled all others in prowesse and armes? Because (quoth he) they are taught from their infancy not to feare death, but shame. As <hi>Marius</hi> also that famous Romane <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall</hi> said of himselfe, hee had learned to feare nothing but <hi>Infamy.</hi> They therefore that by education in lawlesse warres grow so impudent as to vant of their foiles and flights (which by true Martiall lawes, especially in lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Commanders should bee noted and punished with perpetuall shame) are so farre of fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> true Souldiery, and Martial honor as they are fitter (like most dangerous contagious sheep) to be expelled &amp; seuered in time, lest they infect with their leprosy the whole troup &amp; Military flock: howsoeuer the corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of this age &amp; ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ensue by conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt of true Martial honor may excuse or delay their due punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t or shame for a time. For if a chief Commander shal neither blush to saue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self by flight, nor corruptly to make his gain by the death
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:10245:13"/>
of his poore Souldiers through Frauds, periury, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt in Musters: his readiest plot to grow rich and puis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant is, presently so soone as hee can finger his souldiers pay, or Princes Treasure, To deuise some desperate vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feasible Seruice, where he may bring his <hi>Fantery</hi> to haue their throats cut, and then hauing choise horses to saue himselfe by flight, and his confederate Fauorites with the pay of the dead, they may banquet and riot their fill, and haue so great Masses of Treasure to make friends, as none of these Tragedies can come to vnripping, if once it bee perswaded lawfull or intollerable for a Generall or chiefe <hi>Commaunders</hi> to saue themselues by flight.</p>
            <p>But the tollaration thereof and of these Fraudes and abuses in Musters, and the immeasurable sweete gaines that bad consciences see they may make thereby (if they can also shake of shame, and extinguish true Martiall discipline) is the chiefest <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> use of all base and dishono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable corruptions, and will still encrease such impudency and insolency as corrupt persons by sufferance will grow vnto: Which ought so much the more seuerely and spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily with the sword of Iustice and true <hi>Militarie Lawes</hi> in time to bee corrected, as the continuance doth make the disease more desperate and perrilous to their State, and more hard to bee recured, when wealthie wickednes thereby getteth such authoritie and purchaseth such par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as after by Iustice shall hardly bee suppressed, vnlesse the <hi>Souereigne Maiestie</hi> or <hi>Ephores</hi> of the <hi>State</hi> in time I say minister the bitter Medicine, that onely must cure this pestilent and contagious sicknesse.</p>
            <p>For if <hi>Demetria</hi> of <hi>Sparta</hi> with her owne hands killed (for cowardize) her sonne <hi>Demetrien</hi> as a degenerate Monster not worthy to bee called a <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> or to walk on the earth, being (as she said) a monument disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable to his countrey and parents, and the like done by diuers other Ladies and worthy Women of that <hi>State</hi> to their owne children, for abandoning onely of their

Or if this fault of <hi>Flying</hi> or abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their Rank only hath beene in a priuate souldier so abhorred, as his owne Mother hath executed Martiall Iustice vpon him, with detestation of his cowardize as vnworthie to drinke of the Riuer <hi>Eurotas,</hi> or to beare the name of a <hi>Lacedemonian</hi>: How much more is the same to bee detested in a <hi>Commaunder,</hi> On whose error or cowardize the liues of so many as are vnder his charge dependeth, besides the dishonour of his Nation?</p>
            <p>Or if that fault could receiue in that Martiall Nation no excuse, though they were enforced therto by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and Multitude of their enemies: How much more abhominable is it in them that of purpose before hand are prouided of their meanes to runne away and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don those for whose safetie it were their duty to sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice their liues? And by leauing their souldiers to the butchery, to make their excessiue gaines by the payes of the dead and Robberie of their Prince and Countrey.

And first for <hi>France</hi> that woorthy souldier Mounsier <hi>de la Nôe</hi> in the Military <hi>Discourses</hi> plainely sheweth, how with these ciuill warres these corruptions there began, and by what vnlawful Generation Mistresse <hi>Picorea</hi> was at <hi>Boygenye</hi> first begotten, which bastard in short time had such a Multitude of Seruants both in <hi>France,</hi> and after in the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> as they created their mistresse a <hi>Ladie</hi>: And that mightie Ladie Madam <hi>Picorea</hi> hath now so many braue seruants, (not onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the French and Dutch, but of other Nations also) as it is to bee feared they will make her a <hi>Queene,</hi> to the Ruine of all <hi>Kings, Queenes</hi> and <hi>Realmes</hi> that shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure her, and not suppresse in time both her, and her shamelesse presumptuous, lewde, licentious seruants.</p>

For if these mischiefes (saith that woorthy Souldier) were like to other crimes, where men (condemned by publique Sentence) are quietly content to bee led by the Executioner to receiue their due, they might full soone bee banished. But they fare more like a rough and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stife horse, that (being touched with his Riders spurre) lasheth, yerketh, and biteth, and therefore such a Iade must roughly and rigorously bee corrected and made to know his fault: For if ye spare him or seeme to feare him, hee will sure vnhorse you, for generally these Militarie vices are presumptuous. And if they smel you feare them they will braue you: But giue them the terror of Lawes, and their due punishments seuerely, and so shall you cure their maladie. For most mercifull is that rigour, that (by dispatch of foure or fiue) many saue the liues of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundreds, or rather thousands, and recure such a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilent contagion as is able in time to subuert the most mightie Realmes and Monarchies. When yron is fouly kankored, it is not inough to annoint it with oyle, but it must bee roughly and forcibly scoured and polished, to make it returne to his perfect brightnes. And if in <hi>Pleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies</hi> and other like corrupt exulcerations wee haue no remedie but to open a veine, and content our selues to part with many drops of our blood to saue the whole bodie from destruction: So must we be content (though it were with the losse of many such corrupt persons) to

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:10245:16"/>
               <hi>States.</hi> It is a singuler warning to King and Princes that haue Realmes to commaund, that not yet so farre corrupted, and able to yeelde maintenance for honest and right Martiall souldiers, by no meanes (for want of conuenient wages, stipend, and pay) to giue any colour or excuse to this degenerate ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stardly kinde of Seruitors, or rather Pickers, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse their corrupt Artes, or Diuellish craftes and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buses.</p>
            <p>And for their Subiects of all degrees rather to giue double and treble Subsidies yearely to continue an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable pay, for maintenance of sober, valiant, paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, honest, obedient souldiers in true Martiall discipline, than to become a praye to these mercilesse carrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, degenerate insatiable monsters. And it is to bee hoped the present King of <hi>Fraunce</hi> (if God blesse him with any obedience of his Subiects (as were to bee wished, and his constancie in Religion, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Heroicall vertues meriteth) will no doubt by all due meanes in his Territories endeuour to procure a Reformation of these horrible disorders, which is yet vtterly impossible for him to redresse, being in that state, by long continuance growne to a most difficile and hard cure.</p>
            <p>But as the Estates of the vnited Prouinces (by meanes of such bad pay and collections of corruptions in their Martiall or rather mercenarie <hi>Commaunders</hi>) did also for many yeares together continually lose by peacemeale a number of strong Fortes, Towers, and Prouinces in their possessions, being driuen almost on euery side downe into their Marches where they were enforced to implore her Maiesties present ayde to escape their impen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ruine: So, hauing of late (by honourable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of her Maiesties Bands) well reformed that their base kinde of pay, and in part thereby also their other ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uses (which of late yeares hath crept in among their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies)
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:10245:16"/>
haue beene able to make head and recouer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, many of those important places that before they lost: Repayring thereby somewhat the fault of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Errors.</p>
            <p>Yet when I perswade to giue vnto all Colonels and such like chiefe Commaunders such Entertainment as may suffice them contentedly to liue, without see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king so much as (by tolleration or suffering of Frauds to enrich themselues, or to supply their wants. It is no part of my meaning to haue <hi>Collonels</hi> so commune, or such multitude of needlesse Officers, as in disorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly warres hath beene accustomed. For one <hi>Collonell</hi> or <hi>Maestro del Campo</hi> may very well suffice for three or foure thousand men, and the contrarie is but an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use and embasing of that name which should not bee bestowed but on olde souldiers of iudgement and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, able to discharge a place of that importance. And this Officer hauing (for himselfe, his <hi>Martiall,</hi> his <hi>Serieant Maior,</hi> and other necessary chiefe Officers of his Regiment) conuenient allowance to maintaine on honourable Table, the inferiour priuate Captaines may and ought to content themselues with meaner port till (by vertue and desert) they bee aduaunced to higher place: And (abhorring all vanitie in appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, and wastefull expences in baser appetites) ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour themselues by trauell, care, good Armes, and trayning of their companies (in right Martiall exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and exploits in the Field vpon their Enemies) to make their value knowne, and by such <hi>Aemulation</hi> one to excell another, whereby they may bee chosen and aduanced to higher offices: The priuate Captaines place being indeede but the first steppe toward Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall honour: And therefore not to bee accompanied with such pompe, as now is too too vsuall.</p>
            <p>It may perhaps be replied. So long as men are content to accept these glorious names only (without any charge to

their Princes purses, or crauing any encrease of pay) it is a small matter to content phantasies with Feathers.</p>
            <p>I answere, it it a matter of farre greater consequence than is conceiued: For, first it embaseth those degrees of honor which chiefly should allure right Martiall mindes, and makes them seeme vile, when they are so common as they fall to the the lot of persons vnworthy such degree, and so grow in contempt; and not affected after by the true honourable mindes: Besides wanting maintenance for the due port of that place, they are enforced to bee patrons to all or many of those disorders and abuses be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, vnlesse they would choose to vndoo themselues and friends to maintaine it otherwise, which fewe I thinke now a daies vse to doo.</p>
            <p>Farther hauing once taken a greater name, they disdain euer after to serue in any inferiour calling, fitter indeede for their Experience: And so become persons altogether vnprofitable, and to maintaine those glorious names en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced (by shift of braine) to trie conclusions: And so by all these meanes the cause of greater inconueniences.</p>
            <p>I conclude therefore by all these reasons before al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged, and the successe of plaine experience also (both of old time, and in our owne age) that as it is more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable for the Prince, and most necessary for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement of the Seruice, to haue all chiefe needefull Commaunders to haue such compleat Entertainment, as they may (without extortion or corruption in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, or alteration of abuses in others) maintaine their place with Reputation, and execute Martiall discipline with seuerity. So discharging their duties honorably and honestly they shal saue at least one third part of the royal or publike Treasure, and yet the forces (though not in shew of Ensignes to scare Dawes) yet in armed hands to conquer Enemies farre more strong and puissant than those multitudes of colors farced with Freebooters or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther seely vnarmed Ghosts or disordered Mutinous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:10245:17"/>
that by licentious education will scarcely endure the paines of <hi>Watch</hi> and <hi>Ward,</hi> or abide the due executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any true Martiall discipline. And as these superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Gouernours and Commaunders (doing their duties) are worthie of all reputation, credite, aduauncement, and honour: So contrariwise, after they haue conuenient en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, if they shall be found the Patrones or Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dars to such corruptions and abuses as tend to the ruine of all true discipline Militare, I would wish them disgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and with all shame disarmed as vncapable euer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to their graue, of any true Martiall honour.</p>
            <p>And for proofe of this <hi>Proposition</hi> in all the chiefe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers also of an Armie, for a taste of the rest hauing cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen to treate of the <hi>Martiall Censor,</hi> or generall <hi>Comptro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi> of <hi>Musters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I say there are of this kinde of Officers (as likewise of all others) two sorts: The one, honest, iust, fearing God, &amp; respecting the honour, commoditie, and aduauncement of their Princes Seruice. The other, neither iust, nor ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, nor possessed with any Feare or Reuerence of God: but (ayming onely at fauour, wealth, and aduauncement in this corrupt world) care not what becomes of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, so they may by any meanes enrich themselues, and purchase friends to backe them in all their vnhonest pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings. But more briefely or plainly to set forth the different or repugnant pathes of these two sorts of Officers, I cannot better than by these <hi>Briefe Conferences</hi> of the <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Bad</hi> ensuing.</p>

            <p>But this Conference of either kinde I hope it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth plainly both how many Enemies the honest must of necessitie in this age of Militarie corruptions drawe vpon him: And likewise how great a multitude of friends the vnhonest may make by their confederacy with others of that humor in robbing of the Prince or publique Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: And therefore how necessarie it is that aswell the honest bee honoured with Entertainment and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance answerable to their reputation and credit of their place, as the contrarie well sifted and extraordinarily pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished in terror of abuse.</p>
            <p>But as it is apparantly best for the honor of any Prince or State to haue this honest office so backed with honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Entertainment &amp; authority as he may boldly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feare or regard of any offence controll fraud, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to enforce all Captains to keep their Bands compleat, or dul to checke their defaults aswell for Armes as men: So is it also asmmuch for the profit &amp; benefit of the king Prince, or State (in respect of the sauing of their Teasure, which no way in the world shall bee so extremely and vnprofitably wasted, as by the ignorance, confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racie
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:10245:20"/>
or abuses of these Officers, if they be vnskilful, base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded or dishonest: As none can better testifie (if they wil truly confesse their errors) than the States of the Low-Countries, who I think haue had ful exeperie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme mischief ensuing by imployme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of base co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>missaries with poore wages, in place of so great trust &amp; importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.</p>
            <p>But somwhat to say of our own Nation, omitting theirs, I thinks there is no indifferent person but will confesse, That in the Earle of <hi>Leycesters</hi> time of Gouernment, the English Bands generally in the <hi>Queens</hi> pay (a very few ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) were maintained euer farre stranger than eyther before or since, and great reason it should be so: For as neither her Maiestie, nor any Prince of <hi>Europe</hi> euer paid more iustly and honorably than in his time, hauing euery foure or six moneths at farthest till the last, a full pay: So was there also so facile &amp; easie meanes for all Captains in her M. pay fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> time to time the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> stil to supply &amp; Reinforce their Bands without the Captains charges, as neuer was neither before nor since. For besids the 40, Footbda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; 10 Cornets of horse (by contract in her Ma. pay) there was euer at the charge of the countrey also many other En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Ensignes all the Earle of <hi>Leicesters</hi> time, somewhile 20, somtime fortie, and sometime 70, Ensignes at a time, which being by the States as extreme badly paid then, as the Queenes Maiesties were honorably &amp; well: Any En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish souldier that could get out of their Bands into the Ensignes of her Maiestie thought themselues aduanced from Hel to Heauen. Hereof it came to passe that all the Earle of <hi>Leicesters</hi> time the Captains in her Maiesties pay needed not to send into England for souldiers at great charge, for their leuying, arming, &amp; transporting to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply their Bands as since they haue: but continually Suite was made vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by souldiers of this ill paid voluntary Bands to be receiued into the Queens Maiesties pay: For those soldiers would rather frely forgiue their own pay to their Captains, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tary in the States pay, if they could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a place in any of her Ma: Bands: And so the Captains
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:10245:21"/>
of her Maiesties Bands (without any charge at all) had meanes then still to maintaine and keepe their Ensignes compleat, which (neither before nor since) they euer could (without their charges in sending for and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting of new souldiers out of England) for the which they can haue no allowance but vpon speciall petition to her Maiestie.</p>
            <p>Farther the Earle in his time of Gouernment tooke such courses to make the Captaines keepe their Bandes strong, as neuer were before nor since. For at the first, finding many Bands of fooftemen left vnto him extream weake, not 60. souldiers in a Band of 150. and halfe a doozen such Bands at one Muster and one place: his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency gaue a generall day to all Captaines in her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties List to haue their Bands reinforced strong, or else to be checked according to to their weaknes at the next future Muster: As they should likewlse for his time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the benefit for the time past, not to bee checked, if they were found compleat, and strong for Seruice at that their appointed day.</p>
            <p>This generally made them all, or the greatest part con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, who might Reinforce their Bands strongest.</p>
            <p>Againe his Excellency (being both Gouernour for the <hi>States,</hi> and <hi>Generall</hi> for her Maiestie) had the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of both forces, and thereby caused Musters Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall in his time to bee alwaies made of all souldiers in euery Garrison at one instant: Whereby the souldiers in the States pay could not fraudulently bee lent or bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed to fill the Queenes Bands at Musters, as otherwise they might haue doone.</p>
            <p>There was also such Ordinances for Musters established by his Excellency as neuer the like in those Prouinces (or better in any other) can be shewed, to enforce the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines that for feare of due checke (if for their owne credit any Reputation otherwise they would not) to keep their Bands compleat: By which Precedents the States
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:10245:21"/>
haue since much reformed their <hi>Militia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And with all so honourable Entertainment allowed the Muster-Master General at that time, as (if he would haue but winked willingly at corruptions) he had beene worthie of all shame and blame: Who thereby (hauing conuenient meanes, carrying a seuere hand (according to his dutie) to execute his office iustly, was so maligned of the licentious sort of Captaines, as they would vow to keepe their Bands more than compleat, rather than he should haue a penny checke out of their Bands toward his Entertainment,</p>
            <p>The honest therefore and honourable (for their owne commendation) and the licentious and malignant (for feare of checke and enuie against the Muster-Master) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend all, who might keepe their Bands fairest.</p>
            <p>And yet I thinke there will bee found more checks cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, notwithstanding in the Earles gouernment fiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folde for respectiue time, than other before or after; When the Bands were farre weaker, besides the checkes respited to farther Examination, which would haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted vnto much more, if by conning practises they had not procured his disgrace.</p>
            <p>But as the bestowing some time of a thousand or two thousand pounds a yeare on the maintaining of <hi>Sluces</hi> and <hi>Milles</hi> for the drayning of Marshes, may in some <hi>Leuelles</hi> by clearing of the waters encrease their good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse &amp; value of their grounds twentie thousand pounds a yeare to be bestowed on these necessarie Engines may leaue them so insufficient as they shall not bee able to drayne the waters. And thereby the whole leuell of Marshes improfitable, or many score thousand of pounds in their value yearely lost. So fareth it in the due main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of these important Officers in causes Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarie.</p>
            <p>The Like I say of the Marshall and <hi>Serieant-Generall,</hi> and many other, who if they haue wil and skil to execute

their duties without regard of offence to the bad and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious in matter of Iustice, and vse their office as they ought, to aduance the profit and seruice of the Prince (which without compotent and honourable Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not to bee expected) they may not onely be able ten-folde in the aduancement of the Seruice to deserue their wages, but euen (in sauing of Treasure) requite it ten-folde also.</p>
            <p>And therefore soundly may conclude, That neither the sparing of Seede by the fond <hi>Husbandman,</hi> nor the pinching of pence before mentioned by the miserable <hi>Merchant,</hi> in the rigging and furnishing of his Ship, Nor want of due allowance for <hi>Drayning</hi> of Marshes by conuenient Engines is halfe so fond and absurd, as the omitting of such necessarie <hi>Officers</hi> in <hi>Martiall causes,</hi> Or the sparing of such Entertainment as should enable them to discharge their offices iustly and honourably, That by corrupt and lucrous pettie companions may be managed to the extreme Robbing of the Prince, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of all true Martiall discipline. For euen as in this office of <hi>Censor</hi> or <hi>Comptroller-Generall</hi> of Musters a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt person may with farre greater gaine giue his Prince two thousand pounds a yeare to farme that Office tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an honest officer can take two thousand pounds yearely En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment for him and his Substitutes faithfully to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge it: So shall the 2000, pounds giuen by the Prince to such a one, bee ten-folde more gainfull and beneficiall to his Seruice, than the 2000. pounds taken: Which by due consideration of the frauds and deceipts practized, and by mee at large in a particular Treatise thereof alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die reuealed, And hy the very triall or experiences alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die made (duely weighed) will euidently appeare.</p>
            <p>And therefore may truly say, that aswell for the profit of all Princes and States, as for the honour and aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the seruice, it is fit this Officer (as likewise all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Officers or Commaunders of like importance and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:10245:22"/>
necessitie) should haue such conuenient Entertainement for the Reputation of their place, as they may (without feare or regard of any) syncerely censure and controll all deceipts and abuses, by whom soeuer they finde then boulstered or patronized. And hauing indeed such al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance as the Reputation of their place requireth, if any such be found (for any respect) to become partie or pander of such corruptions and Robberies, whereby the Royall Treasure should bee vnduly wasted, the forces en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feabled and Martiall discipline corrupted <hi>Tanquam reum lasae Maiestatis,</hi> I would haue such a one <hi>Exemplarly</hi> to bee corrected with all blame and shame.</p>
            <p>And for a finall conclusion of this true <hi>Paradox</hi> may confidently confirme. <hi>That the most thriftie, and sparing course that any Prince or State can take to continue a warre, (without wasting of their treasure, or ouer-burdening of their Subiects with intollerable Taxes) is still to allow all necessary Commaunders, Officers, Captaines, and Souldiers such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient, large, and sufficient Entertainment, as men of true value and honestie may indeed rest therewith contented: And then to execute seuere Martiall Discipline on all frauds, Robberies, and Extorsions, without respect of Persons.</hi>

            <argument>
               <p>That the Antique Romane and Graecian discipline Martiall doth farre exceede in Excellency our Modern, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all alterations by reason of that late inuention of Artillerie, or fire-shott.

            </argument>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas among many Captaines and Commaunders of the newe <hi>Moderne Martiall Discipline,</hi> it is maintained for a <hi>Maxime</hi>: That all ancient <hi>Romane</hi> or <hi>Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> Militarie Lawes and Orders of the Field (aswell for Gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as trayning of their Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers) are for the warres of our age meere Mockeries, and that the fury of the Ordinance and other rare. Inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our time is such, as hath enforced a necessarie change of Discipline and Order in all those matters: I thinke it fit to open the Error and absurditie of this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, held eyther of such as of ignorance discommend
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:10245:23"/>
that they neuer vnderstood, or vnaduisedly are miscaried with the authoritie of others, or of malitious subtilty seeke to aduance such opinions, as may reduce all Marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Actions to a turbulent confusion, whereby such cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, base minded persons (as seeke the warres for gaine) may excessiuely enrich themselues, euen with the ruine of their countrey.</p>
            <p>I therefore to the contrarie auerre: That neither the furie of Ordinance, nor any other like inuentions of this our age, hath or can worke any such alteration: But that the auncient discipline of the <hi>Romane</hi> and Martiall <hi>Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> States, (euen for our time) are rare and singuler <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents.</hi> And that many such customes as wee haue taken vp (contrarie to those honorable and right Martiall Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents) will worke our vtter shame and confusion, if we should encounter with such warlike Troops and soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers as their discipline then bred: And yet not impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible but facile for any King in his owne Realme (especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of our Nation) by those ancient Praecedents to select and frame a <hi>Militia</hi> as farre surmounting in value vulgar Moderne as the <hi>Lacedemonian,</hi> the <hi>Macedonian,</hi> or any other <hi>Graecian</hi> did the effeminate <hi>Persian,</hi> who in sundrie battailes haue vanquished them when in number they were double, treble, yea manifold the greater, and in wealth and riches farre exceeding. And to enter into the opening of this truth (so much repugnant to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt generally receiued of the greater multitude pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing Armes) First I say, That like as in all other Artes and Sciences it is a matter of verie great importance to haue sure grounds and true Principles without abuse or error. So in this Art Military (whereupon dependeth not onely the liues of so great multitudees, but also the defence or ruine of the greatest Realmes &amp; Monarchies) it were to be wished that men were not to be misled with such false and fraudulent opinions as may bring-forth fruits most poysonous and perrilous.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:10245:24"/>Seeing therefore by the ciuill warres which haue risen in this our age, diuers disorders haue spung vp, and for want of abilitie to make due pay to souldiers, the <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals</hi> and chiefe <hi>Commaunders</hi> to haue beene enforced to tollerate many abuses which in time haue growne vsuall, and by vse of some disciples (bred in such lawlesse dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centions) not onely learned and practised, but peruerse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maintained to bee not onely tollerable, but also lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, yea farre excelling the auncint discipline of the Romane and Greeke Armies.</p>
            <p>This error because it tendeth to the aduancing of vice: and defacing of vertue, to the extolling of many corrupt new practised abuses and licentious delicacies, and the reiecting or contemning of the sober painefull, strict, seuere, and sacred Militarie discipline of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie.</hi> I thinke it fit to touch some principall points, wherein the Moderne <hi>Militia</hi> (which I reprooue) doth dissent from the <hi>Antiquitie</hi> (which I commend) and propone as a <hi>Praecedent</hi> for vs to imitate: That any Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier of iudgement (not caried wilfully with corrupt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection) may see, how farre awrie they are, that so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much extoll the one, or disdainefully contemne the other.</p>
            <p>But first (lest I bee misconceiued) I must explaine a little farther, My meaning not to bee precisely to binde our Nation, or any other, to the same very Rules or Lawes which the Romanes or any <hi>Graecian</hi> State was ruled by, which most florished in Martiall prowesse, I thinke the same as great an error as that of some <hi>Diuines,</hi> who would haue all Nations ruled by the verie same po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litique Lawes and paynes that <hi>Moyses</hi> praescribed to the <hi>Iewes</hi> or people of <hi>Israell.</hi> For albeit those di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Lawes were prescribed by the infinite wisedome of GOD himselfe, and for those people (no doubt) the most conuenient, yet, as times, and States, and dispositions of Nations are variable and different, So
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:10245:24"/>
may the paines or punishments bee made more seuere or remisse, as the Magistrates and choise members of each State, (assembling as Physitions to cure the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies growing in the bodie of their Realmes) shall finde conuenient: So as they make nothing Lawfull that is by Lawes Diuine prohibited, for that were flat impietie. So say I also, there is in the discipline Militarie of those Martiall States-antique, many things, which (according to the nature and disposition of our people) wee may mitigate or encrease, alter or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate. But the dissent in the verie chiefe grounds and principall <hi>Axiomes</hi> of the Art Martiall (as such men of warre of the new Discipline doo) I holde it a daungerous error, and fit to bee effectually regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and speedily reformed. Neyther is it any part of my meaning, and to taxe or reprooue all <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, Commaunders, Collonels</hi> or Captaines that serue in these our Moderne warres, as men corrupted or depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with these erronious opinions. For my selfe in mine owne experience haue knowne many, that high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly esteeme the auncient and true Martiall Discipline, and condemne as much the intollerable abuses that haue growne in by the late intestine &amp; ciuill discentions.</p>
            <p>As in <hi>France,</hi> how much that worthie Prince of <hi>Condie</hi> and Admirall <hi>Shattilion</hi> abhorred those disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders which in their time began (and are since growne to their ripenesse or rather full Rottennesse) may partly appeare by their Campe-Lawes, sauouring altogether of the Antique true Martiall Discipline, as farre forth as the corruptions of this age, and their wantes to pay their Troopes would permit. As by that I haue at-large set-downe in my <hi>Stratioticos</hi> touching their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarie lawes, more manifestly will appeare. Likewise in the Militarie <hi>Treatize</hi> of that famous <hi>Generall, Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lame de Bellay Seignior le Langey</hi> of <hi>Discipline Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,</hi> more euidentlye dooth appeare: Howe much
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:10245:25"/>
hee disliked also of the corrupt customes in his time, growne into the warres of <hi>France,</hi> and how hee labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to reduce it to the perfection of those auncient Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall States, that for many hundred yeares together (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing made that Art and profession, and thereby mightily aduanced their Realmes in <hi>Fame,</hi> honour, and wealth, and also encreased their Territories) had indeed attained to the high perfection thereof.</p>
            <p>How much also that famous Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liked with these moderne abuses (albeit for want of meanes to pay, and also authoritie sufficient to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne as hee would, hee were enforced to tollerate in his Mercenary Commaunders many of those corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) my selfe know by that I haue diuerse time, heard, euen from his owne mouth, besides that appeareth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise by his <hi>Remonstrances</hi> and Military <hi>Ordinances.</hi> The like I could say of many of our owne Nation, Men of honour, experience and value, that both know and acknowledge how necessarie it were to haue a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Moderne abuses, and Restitution of true Martiall discipline, but are loath to make themselues odious to such multitudes, as (hauing beene bred-vp in those base, easie, corrupt lucrous customes) would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely hate such a Gouernour, or Commaunder as should crosse their profit, and in his owne Regiment first with seueritie begin such Reformation: Which is indeed not to bee performed but by the authoritie and Maiestie of a Prince and Royall State, that is able both to pay and punish.</p>
            <p>So farre am I therefore from condemning all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunders of this age, eyther of our owne Nation or theirs, for <hi>Patrones</hi> of these Moderne corruptions and basterdly degenerate Souldierie, as cleane contrariwise in mine owne experience and knowledge I can cleare many: Hauing my selfe knowne and conferred with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of our owne Nation that asmuch abhorre them, as
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:10245:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that famous souldier of <hi>France Mounsier de la Nôe,</hi> whom I haue my selfe also heard, aswel in his priuate speeches, as since in his Military discourses discouer his extreme dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like of such our modern vnsouldierly corruptions, which neuerthelesse my selfe saw hee was in part inforced to tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerate, euen then, when hee was <hi>Martiall</hi> of that mighty Armie by the <hi>States</hi> leuied against <hi>Don Iohn de Austria,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> in <hi>Brabant</hi> vtterly against his will and liking. I can therefore the lesse blame any such of our Nation, as beare for a time with these errors, when they see (by contending for redresse without suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient authoritie) they shall little preuaile, and yet make themselues extreme odious. But for such as will not onely tollerate, but (of purpose to make profit by them) will impudently maintain their moderne costomes good, and better for this age, than the <hi>Auncient,</hi> As I know them most hurtfull members, So I cannot but wish such bad <hi>Patriotts</hi> reformed by better reason, or in time reiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as infected sheepe, that are able with their leprosie and infection to corrupt great multitudes, to the exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue danger of their <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First therefore to shew some principall points, wherein the <hi>Moderne Militia</hi> I speake of, dissenteth from the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi> by mee commended, I say.</p>
            <p n="1">1 It was a very laudable custom of <hi>Antiquity</hi> to haue in their <hi>States</hi> or Realmes <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>scriptos milites</hi> their chosen en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled souldiers, not of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> base, loose, abiect, vnhonest sort, by <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> wel termed <hi>Purgamenta vrbiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> suaru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> but of the honest, well-bred, and renowned <hi>Burghers</hi> and other country Inhabitants that had some liuing, Art, or trade to liue vpon when the warres were finished, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well to haue them practized and trained in all Martial ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises before they came to deale with their Enemies: As also that hauing somewhat to loose, they more du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully and obedienly behaue themselues during the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice. And hauing whereupon to liue when the warres
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:10245:26"/>
were done, neede not commit such Pickories, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torsions, and Outrages, as the common crew of such Caterpillers and Vermine doo: As, (hauing nothing at home to loose, or Art to liue,) seeke the warres onely (like Free-booters) for rauine and spoile.</p>
            <p n="2">2 I say, it was also a commendable custome in those <hi>States</hi> and common-weales to choose Captaines and Commaunders of credit and account in their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, Cities, or Townes, that might traine and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise neighbours in all Martiall and Militarie Exercises at home, before they led them to the warres: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the very children in those States (only by looking on) knew farre better both the vse of euerie sort of weapon, and how to march and raunge themselues into any forme of battell, yea, how to defend themselues (like souldiers) from euery kinde of charge or assault of their Enemies, farre better I say than many of our braue men that haue haunted such licentious warres or pickories many a yeare.</p>
            <p n="3">3 I say also that it was a commendable course to make such choise of Captaines in those <hi>Antique</hi> warres (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men of Reputation of the same countrey or Citie from whence their souldiers were leuied, might haue the greater care to performe their duties towards their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimen and neighbours, among whom they should liue at their returne from the warres, and thereby receiue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer after vnto their death from them and their friends, eyther conuenient praise and loue, or infamie and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred as their Gouernement had merited) So in these daies that the Captaines are become not onely the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, but also the <hi>Pagadores</hi> or Pay-Masters of their Bandes, there is greater cause to haue them chosen not onely of skill and reputation, but also of abilitie to aunswere an accompt of such Treasure as shall come to their handes, for the payment of their souldiers:
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:10245:26"/>
Seeing otherwise (if they bee base-minded corrupt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons) they may full easily wrong, starue, and waste their Souldiers many waies, to make their owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by their death and consumption of their Band, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially where fraudes in Musters by lewde custome shall also growe tollerable. For if any such Captaines bee chosen as eyther haue nothing of their owne at home to liue vpon, or neuer meane to turne into the Countrey, whereas the Souldiers were leuied, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue from them and their friendes the honour or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy, the loue or hatred that their behauiour hath merited what hope is there that such a one will leaue the excessiue sweete gaine hee may make by the flie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing or rather flaying of his flocke, and not (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Moderne Discipline) scrape and rake-in what hee may to liue afterward: hauing neither land liuing, nor Art otherwise to maintaine himselfe when the warres are done.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Likewise where Captaines were rightly chosen of such Reputation and credit as is before repeated, that they had a speciall care in health and sicknesse to prouide things necessarie to preserue the liues of their Souldiers (being their Tenaunts or Neighbours, that euer after to their death would honour and loue them for it, and the kindred and friends of those Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers also, whensoeuer it came to any fight with the Enemie, they were euer most assured and faithfull to such Leaders, and they likewise to them. In such sort as it was almost impossible to breake such a knot ef vnited mindes: but being otherwise leuied (as too too commonly in our Moderne warres hath beene accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, where the Captaine neither knowes his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, nor the Souldiers their Captain before the Seruice, nor euer meane to meete againe when the warres are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) As the loue is small betweene them, So is their fidelitye and confidence much lesse. And as the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:10245:27"/>
Captaine taketh small care to prouide for them eyther in health or sicknesse for any necessaries to preserue liues, So haue as smal deuotion to aduenture their liues for him or his honour (to whom indeed the chiefe reputation of their good seruice alwaies should redound) But rather in all Encounters with the Enemie, how to make shift by flight to saue their liues. If then these kinde of Captains also (very prouidently foreseeing the worst which is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to happen) will not bee vnprouided of a beast, to run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>away, trusting rather to the legs of his horse than to all the hands in his Band: What can bee conceiued? But that heereof chiefely it comes to passe, that in these moderne warres wee heare of so many violent Retraits, (For so in their new discipline they terme that which in the olde warres was called shamefull flight) I meane when the Captaine and some of his Officers spur-away on horsebacke, and the rest throwe away both ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and weapons to leape ditches the more lightly, and are shamfully slaine without resistance: and many times by multitudes (pressing to get boats) do drowne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. Now whether such accidents bee too vsuall or no, I referre it to their owne consciences that most bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will commend this base moderne discipline. And if it be true whether there bee any more likely cause there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of than the diffidence before recited betweene the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and his souldiers, and the want of shame (which in the Antique Souldiery was euer accounted the highest vertue) But now by depraued custome in our licentious degenerate warres vtterly lost and abandoned: and such accounted brauest men that are become of all others the most impudent.</p>
            <p n="5">5 I say also it was a most honorable order to haue it pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with great shame in any souldier to lose or throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>away his Armes, being held among the <hi>Graecians</hi> a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall disgrace for any priuate souldier so much as to loose his Target. But if now both Captaines and some
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:10245:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
chiefe Commaunders also of the Moderne new <hi>Militia</hi> will bee much offended to haue any of their Band so much as checked by the Censor or Muster-Master for lacke of his Curates or Caske. And to encourage either to leaue their Armes, wil seldome themselues euer weare any, but take it for a great brauerie and Magnanimitie in Seruice to bee seene vnarmed. What shall I say but that indeed (for them that neuer meane to fight, but to escape by flight) to bee the lighter for a swift carrier, it is a verie politique inuention and a gainfull Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.</p>
            <p n="6">6 It was also an honourable course of Antiquitie (besides the choise of the Captaines of such credit in their Townes &amp; Countries at their entring also into Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice) to binde them and their Souldiers all with a sacred solemne Militarie oath, being holden no better than a thiefe or Free-booter that followed the warres, vnlesse hee were enrolled vnder some Ensigne, and had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued his Militare oath, whereby hee vowed both obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and fidelitie, and rather to die than dishonourably to abandon his Leader and Ensigne.</p>
            <p>But in such new Discipline these ceremonies are scof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed at, and Captaines chosen sutable to their loose de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praued Soulderie,</p>
            <p n="7">7 It was also a laudable custome to haue the Captaine cary his own Armes in his Ensigne, besides the Ensignes of the Regiments which were among the Romans alway <hi>Eagles.</hi> And that hee that lost his Ensigne should bee held a disgraced man, not fit to carrie Armes till hee had wonne like honour againe.</p>
            <p>But now in our new <hi>Militia</hi> in stead of Ensignes we haue learned to carry colours, because many Captaines perhaps are yet to winne their Armes, and thereby make small account to loose their Maisters colours, which may bee one cause (among many other) that the <hi>Spaniard</hi> within these 20 or 30 yeares can make his vant of the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:10245:28"/>
taking of more English Ensignes, than I thinke they could truly these 500 yeares before.</p>
            <p n="8">8 It was also a most laudable Discipline, wherby men from their infancye were taught in those Martiall Schooles rather resolutely in the Field to die, than to saue their liues by flight, the Mothers detesting and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horring their owne children that saued their liues by flying: yea and some with their owne hands doing exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution on such children of their own as were Fugitiues, rather than they would haue so dishonourable a Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (as they said) to their parents and country to walke vpon the earth.</p>
            <p>But if in our Moderne <hi>Militia</hi> this error bee thought so small, as many such braue men will among their cups vsually vaunt thereof, and recount at how many places they haue fled and runne away: Taking as it were a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to tell who had fled fastest, the chaunge is ouer great.</p>
            <p>As in the ancient Martial States it was (euen in a priuate souldier) held a perpetuall shame to haue ronne away, or somuch as onely abandoned his Ranke wherein hee was placed (vnlesse it were to step forward into the place of his precedent fellow slaine) So in a Captaine or Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour Commander it is much more dishonorable and shamefull: Which hath caused many famous Generals (that ful easily might haue escaped &amp; saued themselues) vtterly to refuse horses offered, and all other meanes to flye, and haue voluntarily sacrifized themselues with their souldiers.</p>
            <p>But if in our new <hi>Militia</hi> many braue souldiers (as they are tearmed by their owne crewe) will not shame to vaunt: In how many places they haue escaped by flight (belike of <hi>Zeale</hi> to fight againe for their countrey) the change indeed is great.</p>
            <p n="10">10 In the <hi>Antique Militia</hi> it was a shame for a Leader or Commaander of footmen to bee seene mounted on

any horse of seruice, but eyther a foote, or for his ease (being wearied) on some small Nagge, which no man could suspect was any way reserued to escape by flight.</p>
            <p>But if in such Moderne <hi>Militia</hi> ye shal haue both Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines and Collonels on horses of swift carrier mounted, and brauely leading their men euen to the place of Butcherie, and then to take their leaue (vnder pretence to fetch supplies) The Discipline is greatly altered. And yet these shamelesse Fugitiues perhaps highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending one another (when the valiant men that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely died in the place, by slaunderous inuentions shall be lewdly defaced) These Fugitiues I say may bee aduanced, and the valiant disgraced, or at least buried in obliuion.</p>
            <p n="11">11 In these <hi>Antique Martiall</hi> Commonweales they vsed to make <hi>Statuas</hi> and <hi>Epigrams</hi> in their honour that resolutely died in the Field for the seruice of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey: and detested such base minded cowards as saued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues by flight. But if contrariwise wee burie their names in obliuion that valiantly died in the field, and extoll Fugitiues, and thinke them not vnworthy of new charges: There is a great alteration indeed of Martiall Discipline.</p>
            <p n="12">12 In the auncient Martiall States and Monarchies, there were publike places of Exercise, where the youth (before they went to the warres) vsed to inure the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues to more heauie armes and weapons farre than the vsuall for seruice, making thereby their ordinarie Armes seeme light and easie to them.</p>
            <p>But if such Patrones of the new Discipline scoffe at these painefull exercises (because they neyther trouble the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues nor the souldiers with the wearing of such Armes) it seemeth that as they of the <hi>Antiquity</hi> prepared themselues to fight and conquer. So these Moderne Commaunders to escape and carowse with the dead paies of their slaine Souldiers.</p>
            <p n="13">
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:10245:29"/>13 The Antique Martiall discipline was to range their Souldiers into forme of battaile by due proportions of Rankes, teaching the succeeding Rankes (where a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the former were slaine) to reinforce their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces maintaining their first Ranks still full with armed handes of fighting men in Martiall order.</p>
            <p>But if such Ringleaders of the Moderne pudled dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, as would haue all brought into a confusion, scoffe at such order &amp; Ordinances, &amp; say, there is no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter way to make a battaile than aduance 4 pikes, &amp; make their Souldiers runne in and fil them: And that all other <hi>Arithmeticall</hi> Rules (for speedie dispatch thereof) are vnfeazible toyes, because their owne skills will not reach it as a matter they neuer set their wits vpon. Whether they were fitter to fould sheepe, or embattell Souldiers I leaue it to the censure of honourable &amp; right Martiall Commaunders.</p>
            <p n="14">14 The discipline was to reduce their Armies into son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie <hi>Battalions</hi> and sundry seuerall <hi>Frounts</hi> whereby the General and his chiefe Officers and Collonels might or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly bring new succours to fight, and relieue such as were tired or weakned by slaughter, and so to renue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fights upon the Enemy still with corragious fresh men till they had entier victorie. And for that cause had they so many Fronts and seuerall kinde of Commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, as <hi>Turmarum Praefectos,</hi> ouer their <hi>Principes, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statos &amp; Triarios: Tribunos Militum</hi> also <hi>Drungarios</hi> or <hi>Chiliarchas, Turmarchas Merarchas, Celerum Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectos,</hi> and many others as in my <hi>Stratioticos</hi> is set down more lagely for their <hi>Fanterie</hi> onely: Whereon those right Martiall Nations reposed their chiefest trust, and yet no idle Leaders or Officers, but euerie one to so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie a purpose as they might not conueniently bee spared.</p>
            <p>But if such men of warre of the new Mould scoffe at all these Ordinances and Supplies, saying: A battell is
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:10245:29"/>
woon and lost in the twinkling of an eye at the first ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and therefore needlesse: Wee may indeede con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse it too true, where they bring their braue men like flocks of sheepe hudle confused to fight, or rather to flight: The battaile is many times indeed gotten before the crossing of pikes. The terror onely of Armes gliste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring is sufficient to scare such pilfering vnsouldierlike Freebooters.</p>
            <p n="15">15 The auncient discipline was euer to encampe their souldiers close together strongly, and so orderly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide their Quarters, and set downe their Regiments: As their campe was like a well fortified Towne, where ten-times so many Enemies durst not assault them.</p>
            <p>But our new discipline, to lodge our Armie in <hi>Villages</hi> farre and wide a sunder, as euery Captaine may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided most for his ease and commoditie like pettie Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and thereby in no place more easily defeated than in their owne lodgings.</p>
            <p n="16">16 The auntient Martiall men thought it not disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable with their owne hands to Entrench their Capms. And their great <hi>Generals</hi> would take the Sho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell in hand themselues when occasion so required.</p>
            <p>But our braue men of the new Discipline disdaine to bee <hi>Pioners,</hi> and will rather lodge abroad in villages at their pleasure and ease like gallant fellowes, where they may take their pleasure, and carouse lustily.</p>
            <p n="17">17 The auncient Discipline reposed their chiefe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in their Fanterie, whom they so trained, armed and ordered: As twentie or thirtie thousand footemen forced not of fiue times so many horsemen.</p>
            <p>But as our footmen of the new Discipline are armed and ordered, a thousand horse is able to defeat fiue times as many such footmen. And yet might the footmen of our time carry weapons of farre greater aduantage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst horse being well ordered, than were knowne in those daies. So great is the error of the Martial Discipline
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:10245:30"/>
of our age among such Leaders, as haue beene trayned-vp in Freebooter warres, and haue vowed their seruice to their Ladie <hi>Picorea,</hi> being carelesse of any thing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to Victory and Honour, respecting rather their owne priuate profit and commoditie.</p>
            <p n="18">18 The auncient Martiall Discipline tended chiefely to this scope, to carry such an Army to the Field, as bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly durst march on all grounds, as well Champion, as by Straights. And in Ordinance readie to fight with the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie by their exercise, order, and assurance, not doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of victorie.</p>
            <p>But the scope of such Moderne Discipline seemeth to bee rather to carrie men (so lightly armed and loosely disciplined) as they may bee nimble to stray abroad to picke and steale, and to escape by flight, when they are charged with any Enemie of force. And as for losse of Ensignes or shamefull flight, they make it a trifling mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, being readie to doe as much againe at any time.</p>
            <p n="19">19 The auncient Discipline would neuer suffer any souldiers to go abroad to spoile, but with Leaders and commaunders to direct and guide them: hauing intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence before hand, which Quarters was best repleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with commodities needfull for the Army, and then sent such forces as might not faile to set it in, or honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably defend themselues if they were encountred.</p>
            <p>But this new discipline will send their souldiers to spoile by handfuls, without Captaine, Lieutenant or En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe to guide them: if they get any <hi>Pickorie,</hi> the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine hath his share: But if their throats bee cut, the Captaine will haue their pay, aswell due before their death as after, by mustering them absent, &amp;c, til the Muster-master discouer it. And whereas such a Captaine should bee disarmed, and by the Prouost hanged for such abuse: By this new Discipline hee will raile at the Muster-master lustely, if hee cheeke him onely the stol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len pay.</p>
            <p n="20">
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:10245:30"/>20 The auncient true Martiall Discipline was, That all <hi>Prayes</hi> (so orderly in the warres take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) should be brought to one place; where Magistrates and Officers of purpose appointed should dispose thereof for the Ransoming of prisoners, and the remounting of such as had their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses slaine in Seruice, and for reward aswell of those that made the Stand, as of those that fet in the pray.</p>
            <p>But in our new Discipline it is <hi>Catch who catch may,</hi> and no order in the world for distribution of the pray for any publique vses, nor for redemption of priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, or remounting of such as in Seruice lost their horses.</p>
            <p n="21">21 The auncient Discipline was that no armed man on paine of death should step out of his Ranke in time of Seruice, to catch or spoile, which they easily obeyed, because by their Martiall Discipline then, they had as good reward out of the pray (that stood in battaile ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) as the loose men that brought it in.</p>
            <p>But in our Moderne warres (where no such order is established, but <hi>Catch who catch may</hi>) there is nothing but confusion: Which cannot be but to their vtter ruine and shame. Whensoeuer such vnsouldierly Freeboo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters shall encounter with any Enemie of good go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment.</p>
            <p n="22">22 By the auncient Discipline (besides the reward of the souldiers which was left to the discretion of the Generall) there were euer great masses of Treasure brought home to the publique Treasurie to maintaine the future warres, and thereby no <hi>Cesses</hi> or <hi>Subsidies</hi> on the people for many yeares together, by reason of the treasure so saued and gained by their well disciplined warres.</p>
            <p>But if by our Moderne Discipline of <hi>Land Seruices</hi> the Prince or State hath no benefit by the spoiles, but is rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tously wasted among such Freebooters and their assoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates and the best souldiers least part of the pray, and by
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:10245:31"/>
such disordered warre, no ceasing of <hi>Taxes</hi> or <hi>Subsidies,</hi> but continua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce or rather encrease of both, in al Realmes and States serued by such spoilers: It is easie to discerne which were the better Discipline for the Prince and people.</p>
            <p n="23">23 By such auncient Discipline <hi>Kingdomes</hi> and <hi>States</hi> by their warres haue encreased their wealth, and their Subiects haue growne more wealthie and mightie.</p>
            <p>But by our Moderne warres both Prince and Subiects grow poore, &amp; few of these vnruly vnsouldierlike Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>booters (how hugely soeuer they get by their corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or abuses) grow wealthie by it, for, <hi>Badly gotten is euer commonly worse spent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="24">24 The scope of the auncient Martiall Discipline was chiefly to preserue the publique Treasure of the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try, and to maintaine the warres on the treasure gotten by conquests on their Enemies.</p>
            <p>But the scope of our Moderne Discipline seemeth to bee to enrich priuate Captaines and Commaunders, and to conuert both the spoiles &amp; the wages of the souldiers also to their particular benefits. And so new Taxes and Subsidies of necessitie still on the people to maintaine the warres.</p>
            <p n="25">25 The auncient Generals and great Commanders had their chiefest care how to preserue their own people which caused them so carefully to arme them, traine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and entrench them strongly, &amp;c. saying the held it more honorable to saue one of their owne Souldiers than to destroy ten Enemies. As they likewise sought to make their Souldiers and Countrey wealthie, respecting no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for themselues but the honour onely of well-doing.</p>
            <p>But in our Moderne Discipline it seemeth, The more of their Souldiers are wasted and consumed, the richer grow such Commanders as by deceipts in Musters haue the conscience to conuert all the dead payes to their own
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:10245:31"/>
profit: Which wicked game of all other is most abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable before God &amp; perrilous to any State: the strength and glory of a Prince onely consisting in the multitude and force of his people which are wasted and consumed by such Moathes and Caterpillers.</p>
            <p n="26">26 These auncient worthie Generals and Commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in the Field bent their wits and inuentions onely for such exploits as might be honourable and profitable to their countrey.</p>
            <p>But if Commaunders of the new discipline deuise onely Exploits to waste and consume the Treasure of their Prince or State: And care not (to supply their owne prodigall Expences) though they spoyle their friends thereby, not onely doing their best to breake amitie and make more Enemies to their Prince and Countrey, but also commit such foolish spoiles as their Prince or State shall bee sure to repay again double and treble any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie or aide they receiued thereby. This abuse sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ought to bee amended.</p>
            <p n="27">27 In those auncient right Martiall States wee shall heare of Generals and Dictators (after they had depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Kings conquered great Princes, and brought home to the Treasure of the countrey mightie masses of Gold &amp; Siluer) were neuerthelesse conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to returne home to their poore houses, no whit enriched in wealth, but only in honour, liuing soberly and temperately as before on their priuate patrimony, and scarcely a peece of Siluer-plate to be seene in their own houses, that haue brought in millions to their State and Realme.</p>
            <p>But if in our Moderne Discipline wee shall see pettie Commaunders (that neuer brought into their Princes Realme or State the hundred part of any such masses of Treasure, but rather haue had their share in wasting huge sums to little purpose) to abound in brauery, wast infinitely in all kinde of vanities, that I say no worse, And more Siluer dishes on their Table than <hi>Quintus Dictator</hi>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:10245:32"/>
or <hi>Scipio</hi> that conquered <hi>Hanniball</hi> and razed <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage</hi>: It seemeth these men serue themselues, as the other did their countrey.</p>
            <p n="28">28 Wee may read of <hi>Romane Generals</hi> that by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering some Prouinces brought so great a masse of wealth to the publique Treasurie of <hi>Rome,</hi> that it ceased Taxes, Tributes, or Subsidies there for many yeares.</p>
            <p>But if our Moderne <hi>Militia</hi> (cleane contrarie) doo still waste and consume the publique Treasure, and bee the cause not of ceasing, but rather of encreasing of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes or Subsidies on their countrey, the difference of Discipline indeed is great: But which were the better for the honour and commodity of our Prince and countrey, is easie by the wise, honest, and right honourable to bee discerned.</p>
            <p>By the <hi>Auncient Discipline</hi> little <hi>Macedonie</hi> conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all the large and spacious Orientall Empire of the proud, rich, &amp; populous <hi>Persians</hi>: And that smal Realme of <hi>Rome</hi> subdued so many Nations vnder their obedience in <hi>Europe Africke,</hi> and <hi>Asia,</hi> and made Tributarie so many mightie Kings, as their Monarchie was of the whole world admired: And that their <hi>discipline Militarie</hi> was the chiefe or onely cause thereof: That famous Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Emperour <hi>Alexander Seuerus</hi> in his Oration to his Souldiers declareth, saying.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Disciplina Maiorum Rempub. tenet, quae si dilabatur,</l>
               <l>Et nomen Romanum, &amp; Imperium amittemus.</l>
            </q>
            <p>If then not onely by the censure or prophesie of that famous Emperour, concerning, that State, but by verie experience also in our owne age of many others our Neighbours round about vs, wee may plainely beholde the successe of this corrupt degenerate Moderne <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia,</hi> so repugnant to the <hi>Auncient</hi>: It were wilfull blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse not to discerne which were the better. And no
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:10245:32"/>
lesse negligence to permit the continuance of so daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous a disease.</p>
            <p n="30">30 Wee shall also read of Generals in those warlike Common-weales, that so highly esteemed of the Martial Discipline of their Nation, and were so zealous therein, as they would not haue it violated in the least point. As <hi>Manlius Torquatus</hi> that would haue executed his own sonne for encountring in particular combate with his Enemie without leaue, and before the <hi>Signall</hi> of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile giuen; Albeit hee had the victorie and strake-of his enemies head in the sight of both Armies, to the great encouragement of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> and terrour of the contrarie side, that tooke that particular Encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as <hi>Ominous</hi> for the successe of the battaile, as it fell indeed out, to the great honour of the Romanes, and vtter ruine of their Enemies. Yet after the victorie this honourable and famous Generall, considering the daunger that might haue fallen out if his sonne had not beene victorious, and that the discipline Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane was broken by this attempt (to fight without licence) hee would not spare it in his owne sonne, but commaunded the <hi>Serients</hi> to apprehend him, and (after hee had beene whipped with rods) to bee openly exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted: wherein hee so constantly perseuered, as his whole <hi>Victorious Armie</hi> on their knees could scarcely obtaine his pardon. If then this breach of one point onely of Militarie obedience (committed of Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimitie and noble courage, and aboundance of <hi>Zeale</hi> to his countrey) was in those daies so seuerely censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: As the father would not haue pardoned his owne sonne, notwithstanding by his happie successe also hee was the chiefest cause of that honourable vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie.</p>
            <p>What shall wee say of such Ring-leaders of corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the new discipline, As shall not of any such Magnanimitie or haughtie courage or Zeale to their
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:10245:33"/>
countrey, but of a base, corrupt, and lucrous minde breake not one or two, but many points of Martiall Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, and therby not get victorie, but more than once or twice receiue those dishonourable foiles and disgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that for shame in those daies no priuate souldier would neuer returne home to abide the due shame and disgrace of. What can be said? But that it is high time to haue these important Errors looked into, least the same succeed heere, which in all other States haue done, where Martiall Discipline hath beene so neglected, and corruptions triumph vnpunished.</p>
            <p>It were infinite to recite all the disorders of our <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne</hi> warres, and would require a long Treatise to lay-open all the commendable Ordinances, Customes, and prouisions of the famous <hi>Graecian</hi> and <hi>Romane</hi> Armies, whereby they honoured and immortalized their <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,</hi> and amplified and enriched their States and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. But these few notes may suffice to shew how great a difference there is betweene the one and the other. Neither is it my meaning to call in question the doings of any particular persons, but onely to open the daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous error of that opinion: That the loose customes of our time should be better than the <hi>Auncient</hi>: Or of such excellency as wee neede no reformation or amende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>For I doubt not by due consideration of these few by mee recited it is manifest how great a difference there is betweene that <hi>Auncient</hi> Discipline (whereby meane and poore Estates were adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced to mighty Monarchies) And these <hi>Moderne corruptions</hi> (whereby flourishing States haue beene spoyled and defaced, and mightie Realmes and Empires brought to ruine.)</p>
            <p>But because some <hi>Patrones</hi> of these new corruptions (for defence of their bad cause) alleage: That the late famous inuention of <hi>Great Artillerie</hi> and <hi>Fireshott,</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen to the Antiquitie, and so farre surmounting all
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:10245:33"/>
the Auncient Romane and Graecian Engines both in ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and effect) hath necessarily enforced so great an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of Armes, Weapons, and Militarie Order, as the discipline also must cleane chaunge: I thinke it fit to set downe some of their chiefe and principall Reasons.</p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>First therefore</hi> (say they) <hi>it is now to small purpose to weare Armes, seeing the furie of the Fireshott is such, as no Armour is able to holde it out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>It is vaine to make Battailes or Battalions in such order and forme ranked, as among the Graecians or Romanes were accustomed. Because the furie of the great Artillerie is such as it o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>eth, breaketh and dissolueth all Orders or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances that yee can imagine to make: And therefore expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience hath taught us</hi> (say they) <hi>to leaue those massie Bodies of armed Battailes that serue but for Buts for the great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillerie to play upon: And to seeke more nimble and light Fanterie that may bee readie to take and leaue at their pleasure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 <hi>And for the seueritie of Discipline in the warres</hi> (they say) <hi>it is like the Phrensie of some Diuines, that would haue men in this world passe an Angelicall life, without any fault or errors: which being so farre aboue the nature of man to performe: In aspiring to it many times they commit more foule and grosse faults than the vulgar sort, that neuer reach at such perfection: and thereby become ridiculous to the world as they also will bee that shall attempt such praecise Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline Militarie, as is vtterly impossible to put in execution, and vnnecessarie for this our age, where Weapons and Orders of the warres are so altered and changed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These are the most effectuall Reasons that euer I could heare alleaged on that side to maintaine their hereticall opinion. But as there is no cause so bad, but may by fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of wit be cleered and made appeare probable. So is there no doctrine so false but by craft &amp; subtilty of mans inuentions shall bee made plausible and to appeare mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of good truth. These reasons indeed at the first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:10245:34"/>
seeme probable, but being duly weighed are no thing woorth.</p>
            <p n="1">1 And first for leauing Armes in respect of the furie of the Fireshot which no portable Armor is able to resist, is both friuolous and false. For there are many reasons to vse conuenient Armes, albeit that were true that they profited vs nothing against the Fireshot. For they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend vs from the <hi>Launco,</hi> from the <hi>Pike,</hi> the <hi>Halberd,</hi> the <hi>Iauelin,</hi> the <hi>Dart,</hi> the <hi>Arrow,</hi> and the <hi>Sword</hi>: yea and from the greater part of the fireshot also that any way endaunger vs in the field: I meane euen the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and indifferent Armor that is made (n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t of Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket or Caleuer proofe) but onely against the Launce and Pistoll. For the greatest part of the fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot that touch the bodies of any man in the field, graze first and strike vpon the ground: And from all such shot, a meane Armor verie portable and easily to bee worne by any souldier, sufficeth to saue a mans life, as ordinary experience in the field daily teacheth. For indeed to lade men with armes of Musket proofe (I am of their opinion) were not possible to endure, and meere folly to put in vre for many respects: too long to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to writing in this place. But this light and meane Armour is still to bee continued in all battailes and bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talions that shall encounter with Pike or Launce, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it assureth the life of man greatly from all other weapons, yea and from the most part of the fireshott also.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Neyther is there any Martiall <hi>Commaunder</hi> of iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that will obiect his Battailes or Battalions as a But for the great or small Artillerie to play vpon: But will alway aduance forward their owne shot and ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test armed loose men to encounter their enemies shot, and surprize his Ordinance before the battailes or bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talions come within daunger of the Artillerie great or small, to bee plaied on at <hi>Poinct Blanke.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:10245:34"/>
shall the enemie bee enforced eyther to put forward his Light-horse or Fanterie before his great Ordinance to guard and defend them: Or else they shall bee posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed or cloyed.</p>
            <p>If hee protect them with horse and foote of his owne from surprize, then may the <hi>Squadrons</hi> march on safely, and so (by good discretion) the armed battailes are in no daunger at all of their Enemies Artillerie, but may aduenture forward in safety to backe their owne shott and light armed, which were sent to surprize or cloy their enemies Artillery. And the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> without any more annoyance of the great Ordinaunce, the Battailes come to ioyne with Launce, Sword, or Pike, as in olde time in auncient warres hath beene accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
            <p>Farther all men know (that are of skill or experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) that great Artillerie verie seldome or neuer can hurt any footeman, that vpon giuing fire onely doo but abase themselues on their knee till the volew bee past, being much more terrible to vnskilfull and vnexpert new <hi>Besoignes,</hi> than any way hurtfull to tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Souldiers. And therefore (as is apparant) no reason in respect eyther of the great or small <hi>Artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> or <hi>Fireshott</hi> eyther to leaue conuenient armes, such as the Antiquitie vsed, and were able to march withall many hundred miles, or such <hi>Battalions</hi> as the <hi>Romanes</hi> vsed. If any man will obiect that <hi>Ruytters</hi> with their <hi>Pistolles,</hi> and <hi>Argoletires</hi> with their <hi>Pettronels,</hi> (which the <hi>Romanes</hi> had not) would beat your massie <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanx</hi> of Pikes (vsed by the <hi>Graecians</hi>) downe to the ground, without receiving any dammage at all by them.</p>
            <p>Heereunto I say, if we had not eyther <hi>Pistolles</hi> or <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> on horsebacke to encounter these <hi>Ruytters</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goletires,</hi> they said somewhat. Or if we had not <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keters</hi> on foot to empale or line our battailes, that
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:10245:35"/>
should more spoile their Squadrons of Ruitters before they could approach nigh the place where they should discharge their pistols. For there is no souldier of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that commendeth the ancient Romane or Graecian Discipline that would haue vs reiect all Moderne wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons to cleaue to theirs onely. But embracing the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne fireshot also to leaue the abusing of them, and vsing them rightly to vse still the auncient and right Martiall Discipline also of the Romanes and Graecians. Wee see (long since the fireshot hath beene vsed) that the <hi>Zwitzers</hi> notwithstanding haue continued their massie battailes of armed pikes like the <hi>Gaecian Phalanx,</hi> and verie honourably dischargd themselues both in <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, France,</hi> and <hi>Germanie.</hi> In such sort as the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> &amp; the <hi>French King</hi> both relied on them greatly, and to this day (of the Mercenaries) they carry the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation with the best. So that no furie of the fireshot hath euer caused them to leaue their massie <hi>Phalanx</hi> by the <hi>Graecians</hi> vsed.</p>
            <p>How much lesse then should the <hi>Romane</hi> Order of <hi>Battallions</hi> feare our Fireshot? Nay rather is it not the most excellent ordinance that possibly can be imagined? As well to open themselues (without disorder) to giue a way to their Fireshot to saly forth, and retire in safety without any daunger of any charge by their Enemies horse, and so more fit and conuenient for our warres and weapons now in vse, than they were for the weapons of that age wherein they were first practized? And if nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the small nor great artillery of our age could euer make the <hi>Zwitzers</hi> or <hi>Launce-Knights</hi> to leaue their massie mayne Battaile or <hi>Phalanx,</hi> but that in all warres they haue so honourably discharged themselues, as all Princes are glad to embrace their friendships and aydes: how much more wold they haue excelled, if they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiued also the Roman Embattailing in <hi>Battalions,</hi> which they inuented onely to defeat the <hi>Macedonian</hi> and <hi>Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian

Phalanx.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Now for the 3. <hi>Inuectiue</hi> against their Phrenzie that would haue in <hi>Souldierie</hi> or <hi>Diuinitie</hi> such refined Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, as is impossible for men, and more fit for Angels.</p>
            <p>I answere I am indeede of their opinion, that it is fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasticke and phanaticall to aduise such a Discipline any way, as is impossible for men to obserue. But if the <hi>Graecians</hi> and <hi>Romanes</hi> also (being men in flesh as we are) many hundred yeares together did obserue and keepe such Discipline as I perswade, Then I cannot see any such impossibility as they inferre, Or would make Princes beleeue. But the truth is, it is not for the profit or priuate benefite of such mercenarie Commaunders as most co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly manage the wars of our age, to haue that honorable auntient seuere discipline reuiued, which is the cheefe impedime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Yet somewhat also I confesse in <hi>Europe</hi> the great wealth that most Nations are in this age growne vnto, and the delicate education of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren from their infancie doth make that seuere disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline more strange vnto vs, and somewhat more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile to put in execution, As all things of highest <hi>Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie</hi> are also accompanied with greater difficultie. But if it be compared with the greatnes of the good that therby shall ensue, and the great necessity without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay to haue it done, (If we esteeme libertie and abhorre to be slaues to strangers) it may perhaps be found more easy far than at the first it seemes. Or if at first for mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner faultes we mitigate the paines, and by conuenient degrees proceede to cure the maladie that groweth too too dengerous, we shall at least do some-what if not the best, which is rather to be wished than naught at all.</p>
            <p>But because these <hi>Patrones</hi> of the new <hi>Militia</hi> haue one-other arch Argument (<hi>a Verisimili</hi>) to abuse the world withall; I will also set it downe with such an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere as briefly may open the <hi>fallacie</hi> thereof, and the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie of Reformation without delay.</p>
            <pb n="66" facs="tcp:10245:36"/>
            <p>The fourth Reason.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If (say they) the alteration of weapons considered, there were any better Discipline for the warres, the inuention of man is so excellent in this age, and their wittes so refined, as they would put it in vre, aswell as they haue inuented these fire-weapons, So farre exceeding all their Antique Romaine Rammes, Scorpions, Balistes, and Arcubalistes, as we see those old Engines now (in respect of them) meere toyes: Euen so is also their auntient Discipline, in respect of the rare Militia moderne of our Age.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this reason of theirs I answere: That no doubt the inuention of man in this age is in deede excellent, and farre exceeding the former ages for 500. or 1000. yeares past: as may appeare by all Artes and Sciences that haue of late more flourished than in a thousand yeeres before. But if we haue regard to the more aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient times of the triumphant Graecian States, and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>those mane Empire, we shal finde for al Arts &amp; Sciences ages far excelling ours, &amp; no persons of our age (either for learning or Chiuallrie) yet comparable with them: If comparing the actions and bookes of the one and the other, we will by the fruites iudge vnpartiallie of the trees. But euen as Diuines, Phisitions, Lawyers, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers, Mathematicians, and Rethoricians, and all other (studious of any liberall Sciences in our age) are inforced to repaire vnto those antique fountaines, where all Arts liberall were in their high perfection: So surely for the warres much more we ought, Seeing there was not one Science or Art then, more reduced to her full and supreme perfection.</p>
            <p>Neuerthelesse I deny not, that the <hi>Commaunders</hi> of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:10245:36"/>
our time for that scope and end perhaps they shot at, haue finely framed a Discipline as profitable &amp; perfect, as the antique was for theirs. For in this our age (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie these fortie or fiftie yeares, since the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> left his Martiall actions: And our renowned King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, and <hi>Francis</hi> the French King dyed) there hath scarcely beene any King of <hi>Europe</hi> that hath at any time in any royall war gone to the field himselfe, but only committed their Martiall actions chiefelie to the execution of their <hi>Lieuetennauts</hi> and inferior <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunders,</hi> which must of necessitie make great alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For where a King is <hi>Oculatus testis,</hi> he seeth that which his <hi>Lieuetenants</hi> wil neuer acquaint him with, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not for their commodities.</p>
            <p>When Kings goe to the warres themselues, they see what is profitable or discommodious for themselues and their Realmes, and aduance such Discipline as may be most beneficiall to them and their State, As their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties will such Discipline as may be most commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for themselues, howsoeuer it be good or bad for their King or State.</p>
            <p>Againe in this our age Kings generally haue made their warres (not so much with their owne people, as with mercenaries and hired Souldiers. Who haue rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for their priuate benifite to vse a gouernment and Discipline farre different from that they ought &amp; would if they were led and commaunded by a King of their owne. Their scope perhaps for the most part being to enrich themselues. Howsoeuer the successe of the wars be for the King or State that paies them.</p>
            <p>I deny not but the Moderne Discipline and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes for inriching of themselues, (I meane of Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior <hi>Commaunders</hi>) is most singular and refined to the vtmost. As,</p>
            <p>If a Generall will be content his Captaines shall keepe their Bands halfe emptie, and yet by fraudes in
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:10245:37"/>
Musters make his Prince or State pay nigh compleate.</p>
            <p>If he will suffer them to pill and spoile the Countrey where they lie, oppressing their friends more than their enemies.</p>
            <p>If when he hath fingred their pay, he will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to leade them, or haue them led to some butcherie, where most of their throats shall be cut, that their dead paies may be shared among the Leaders.</p>
            <p>Or generallie for all those pointes of the moderne custome or discipline repugnant to the <hi>Antique</hi>: who seeth not they are as finelie and wittelie inuented for the profit and commoditie of the mercenarie lucrous Commaunders, as possibly can be deuised: and surelie the wit of men can inuent no more than hath beene, To pretend cunninglie the benefite of the Prince and State they serue, and yet finelie indeede to inrich them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues with the impouerishing and very ruine of their Prince or State that payeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And surelie if Mercenary (Leaders that serue not for any Zeale, conscience, or due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie they owe to that Prince or Countrey, but only seeke the warres for gaine) haue framed such a discipline, I cannot so much blame them though they carrie no such <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> or Romane resolution (rather to dy in the fielde, than saue themselues by flight) But choose rather to inrich themselues and their confederates by such es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capes, hauing thereby the sharing of all their dead Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers paies without contradiction, Seeing dead dogges barke not. But after they haue learned abroad in these mercenarie warres this foule, base, couning and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt cowardly Discipline, to bring it home into their natiue Countries: who seeth not it must of necessity worke in time the very ruine of their State? For as a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that hath once made shipwracke of her honestie, easilie maketh a relaps: So fareth it in these mercenary Fugitiues, that hauing once cast away shame (which on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie or cheifelie maketh men resolutelie to sacrifice their
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:10245:37"/>
Liues for their Countrey) afterward become so far past shame, as they hold it no disgrace by shamefull flight at any time to saue themselues. This error alone cree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping into England (if euer we be inuaded by a puissant Enemie) is sufficient vtterly to ouerthrow the State: For it is the honorable resolution of our Nation (<hi>To conquere or dye in the fielde</hi>) that must deliuer England, If we be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaded by a forceable Enemie.</p>
            <p>For we haue no such multitudes of strong Townes as other Countries: Our Armes and weapons are our wals and Rampiers. We therefore of all other Nations ought to reuiue the auntient most Honorable <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Resolution. <hi>To account the shame of dishonorable flight worse than ten deathes.</hi> But seeing it is hard in this age of delicacie to worke in mothers that honorable <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> Resolution (<hi>To abhorre their own children that were Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitiues</hi>) Yet surelie for all men to detest their company, And for Magistrats to disgrace them, (as persons vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy euer after to beare Armes) is a thing not onelie necessarie, but of such necessity as (if it be omitted, and not in time put in due execution) I doubt we shall too late repent it when all remedie will be past: the Wiseman saith not <hi>Had I wist.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My meaning is not to call in question any priuate persons of our Nation, for any errors committed in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine countries: for surely these foule depraued cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes were growne so common among the Mercenary Seruitors of all Nations, as many valiant men by Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of others their Superiors or Leaders haue fallen into them. But when we come to serue (not merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie for pay of strangers) but our naturall Prince and Country, (to whom we owe our bodies and liues) it is fit this part of auntient true Martial Discipline be seuerelie reuiued and published, and remerkable Exampels made vpon the first breakers, As also a due reformation of all such other abuses, fraudes, and deceits, as allure men
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:10245:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thereunto, and tend to the robbing of our Prince, the defacing of true valour, and aduancing onely of subtile, base minded, lucrous cowardly caterpillers, tending fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nallie to the very ruine and ouerthrow of the honour of our Prince and Nation, &amp; faelicious estate of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</p>
            <p>I meane not at this time to enter into the meanes how this Discipline should be reformed, or how <hi>Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery</hi> should be made obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, for it would require a great volume: but by that I haue read of the Roman &amp; Greeke warres, and by mine owne experience conferred with the opinion of other worthie Souldiers and great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunders of our owne age I dare boldly affirme and with good reasons and authoritie maintaine, That it shal be much more easie to frame such an honorable <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia</hi> or <hi>Souldiery</hi> by a leauie of our Contrey-men (neuer in warres before) than of such as haue bene depraued and corrupted in the loose, lewde, lucrous, licentious liberties of the warres of this time: As by that I haue more at large set downe in diuers parts of my <hi>Stratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

This much only in this place I may ad. That albeit <hi>Premium</hi> and <hi>Paena</hi> be most Souereigne medecines to cure all <hi>Vlcers</hi> and infections that happen to the politique bodie of any State, whether it be in ciuill or Martiall causes, yet Example speciallie with our Nation is the cheife.</p>
            <p>For as in the meanest matters (if it be but only in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell, or attyres) the Example of our Court is able to reforme or deforme the whole Land, and by bare Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple only to doo tenne times more than <hi>Proclamations, threatnings, and Statutes paenall:</hi> So in Martiall causes much more wee haue regard to such actions as great Commaunders doe, which in Court are fauoured, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunced,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:10245:38"/>
or countenanced. If they doo well, full easely will all inferiors conforme themselues: But if they either by custome continue courses inconuenient, or by faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of nature be seduced but to tollerate onlie the abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses which are too currant in these daies, and not seuerely chastise the delinquent without regard of pleasing or discontenting the diseased multitude (how good lawes so euer be established, or proclamations made) it is in vaine: For the loose licentious sort iudge them either published onely for fashion sake without regard whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be obserued or no, or els their lewde faction to be so strong as Magistrates dare not punish them: And either of these conceiptes ioyned with the profit and sweetenes these licentious Commaunders make by their corruptions, is sufficient to embolden them more au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daciouslie still to put their fraudes in execution: But, what succeedeth thereof, by example and experience in all ages we may behold.</p>
            <p>First in <hi>Rome</hi> (by reason of the Ciuill warres between <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> and after beetwne <hi>Augustus Caesar, Anthony, Brutus</hi> and, <hi>Cassius</hi>) the Martiall Discipline grewe to corruption, no one side daring to vse the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient due seueritie, lest they should reuolt to his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries. But what ensued, after the right Martial <hi>Legions</hi> were decaied, and a licentious <hi>Praetorian</hi> Guard maintained? but the ruine of that famous and mightie Empire, ransacked, and spoyled by the <hi>Hunnes, Gothes,</hi> and <hi>Vandales,</hi> the most base of all the Barbarous people that they before had conquered.

            <p>And that is that <hi>Moderne discipline</hi> which so greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie the licentious of all Nations swallow vp, and are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected withall by the contagion of such as they haue conuersed with, Tending chieflie to the maintenance of themselues inexcessiue riotous wastings, and to the vtter ouerthrow of all Princes or States that shall beser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with them.</p>
            <p>To conclude therefore this true and needefull <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxe,</hi> I hope (by the conference of these fewe repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant points of the <hi>Auntient</hi> and <hi>Moderne Martiall Discipline</hi>) It doth sufficiently appeare. That as the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter are deuised wholly for the profit of corrupt persons (and both dishonorable and extreame dangerous to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny State or Realme that shall endure them, So the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer which I haue named of the <hi>Antiquitie</hi>) are both for the honour, profit and aduancement of the seruice of any Kinge or State that shall embrace them.</p>
            <p>And therefore too apparant (not only by euident dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of reason, but also by plaine experience and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse in other Realmes &amp; States) That where such abuses &amp; corruption of true Martial Discipline shall be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, there can in time ensue no better than confusion &amp; vtter ruine. And yet nothing doubt, but that our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, As by nature it is as warlike as any other vnder the Heauen (hauing in times past while they were trained &amp;

Arte to speake as fellowes in defence of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</p>
            <p>I euer thought nothing worse for Gentlemen than idlenesse, except doing ill, but could not at the first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue how they might be fitliest busied: To play the Merchants was only for Gentlemen of <hi>Florence, Venice,</hi> or the like that are indeede but the better sort of Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens: ploughing and grazing I esteemed worse than mechanicall occupations: the Court was but for fewe, and most of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> liued too luxuriously: to study or trauel was good, but directed to this ende, that they might be fit for some profession the thing in question: For Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinity they many times thought themselues too good, and I was sure they were most times vnfit: Lawe was but a mony getting trade, and Physicke a dangerous tickle Arte, at last I thought on the warres, where the learned might perfect their contemplation by prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise and the vnlearned helpe that defect by well gotten experience: and this was my 15 yeares meditation: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards that impression was strengthned dayly by the remembrance of my fathers courses, by the experience of some other occurrents and by the obseruation of as many things as my litle reading encountred that might make for that purpose. So I grew to affect scholers such as would speake that, that might be vnderstoode, and could reduce their studie in histories the Mathematickes or the like from speculation to practise for the profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble pleasure of their friendes or honorable seruice of their Country. I liked trauelers so they would be silent, yet were able when time serued to discourse iudiciously of the state and power of more Countries, of the stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth and situation of more Cities, of the forme and force of more seuerall fortifications, than other Corkeheaded counterfeits could recken vp of <hi>Bonna robbas Bordeaus</hi> or apish fashions: aboue all the perfection of the ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uors of the former 2.
