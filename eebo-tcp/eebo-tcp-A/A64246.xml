            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </note> Reader, but that this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of Faith, which is published by us, will be liable to the various and different judgements of men: For as every one stands perswaded in his own mind touching both the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, profit, form and manner of such<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Declarations, so is he like also to pass judgment upon this of ours.</p>
            <p>There are some, who think we ought to abstain altogether from all Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or Declarations, and judg that they are not only not necessary, nor profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

for the Christian Weal-publick, but that they are also unlawful, dangerous, and hurtful in the Church. There are some, who do not indeed think it altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unadvised to publish Confessions or Declarations, much less do they think it unlawful or hurtful; but they judge they ought to be conceiv'd and framed onely in meer pure Scripture-words. There are some, who indeed do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together disallow of Confessions, though conceiv'd in other than bare Scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>words, but will have them to be so gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and brief, that they shall contain and comprehend nothing but what is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely and precisely necessary to be known and believed unto Salvation. There are, lastly, others far different from these, who judge particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions and Declarations even of several most minute and small Controversies, not only so far profitable, but also necessary, that without them a Christian-Society can neither have being, nor well-being. The so various, diverse, and differing judgments of all these this our Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is doubtless like to undergo: and these indeed severally have specious and no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Those who judg that we ought altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to abstain from Confessions, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations, <note place="margin">Objections of the first and second sort.</note> or that they ought not to be conceived but in meer and plain Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture words, (of which sort of men in this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ge there are found not a few, otherwise pious and good men) they, as far as we can gather, pretend for the most part three things for their opinion. 1. For that by reason of them there is done no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ight prejudice to the Majesty and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Scriptures. 2. For that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y occasion of them there is mighty dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and detriment done to the liberty of Churches, or Conscience and Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y. 3. For that by the same a wide gap is open'd for Factions and Schisms in the Church.</p>
            <p>And first indeed they think, that by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>his very means the Majestie of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures is not a little derogated and detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from, for that both their sufficiency and perspicuity seem to be suspected and doubted of; to wit, as if they either did not fully and sufficiently contain all things, that are necessary and profitable
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63915:7"/>
for every Christian Congregation to know, believe, hope and do, or at least did not use those forms of speaking, which do clearly and perspicuously e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough express those Divine Senses or Meanings, which are chiefly savingly necessary and available to be believed, but had need of Mens phrases and forms, for the right understanding of them, and application and use to make a due difference between Truth and fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. From whence afterward they say it comes to pass, that the authority of the Scriptures is more and more weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and at length wholly falleth, and is transferred by degrees to those forms of Men as either more perfect, or the more clear discoverers of what is right and false. And certainly the experience of many ages seemeth not a little to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm these Mens opinions, in which (say they) for the most part it usually fell out, that, after forms of Confessions and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations began to be in esteem, and the said honour to be given to them, as though they did most fully express the hidden and involved sences of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and most clearly and plainly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:63915:7"/>
those things which. are necessarily to be held by the Churches of Jesus Christ, the Majesty and Authority of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures began by little and little to decline, and the truth as also the necessity of all Judgments and Opinions pertaining to the business of Religion to depend upon those forms; in so much indeed, that waving and undervaluing the Sacred Scripture, they appealed unto them as the most certain Squares or Levels, and unexceptionable Rules, and he that swer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved but a fingers breadth from them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though moved thereto out of a regard to the Scriptures, was without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proof accused and condemned of Heresie. And though at the beginning, and in the very Cradles or Infancy of Forms, as they say, it fell not out, but also over and above by Cautions, or Restricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Protestations, and other ways of that kind, they obviated and withstood the same; yet in tract of time, by little and little their Authority prevailed and increased, and through secret increasings by intervals and degrees it was insensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly established and confirmed; until at length, having spread its roots deep, it
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63915:8"/>
began in a manner to over-top the very Scriptures. So by this means in process of time some Oecumenical Councils, and Forms of Belief, or general Creeds, which were concieved and maintained in them, began to be so highly valued, that a like and equal Authority was given to them with the Gospels themselves by the most of men. Yea further, even those things, that were disputed &amp; determin'd by one single <hi>Augustine</hi> against <hi>Pelagius,</hi> at length in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of time were advanc'd to that Dignity and Authority, (and that even among those who otherwise are not wont to set much by the Authority of Councils and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) that it is enough to condemn any one that teacheth in the Church, if his opinion only seem to come near to <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius.</hi> And that it doth commonly so fall out in other questions of Faith, and hath fallen out from every age past they do very speciously affirm. In brief, these seem not to complain in vain, that all Forms usually do together with their age receive the strength and increases o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> too much Authority; and that howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever often-times they seem not op<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nly and manifestly to be advanced and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:63915:8"/>
to an unmeasurable greatness, yet they become by degrees not withstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (even cautions &amp; protestations to the contrary notwithstanding) the immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Canons of Faith, and at least secunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Rules and Levels, and that indeed by so secret and imperceptible motions and advances, that they are found of a certain not to come, but to have come, nor to grow, but to have grown to the top of more than humane Authority and height of supreme Dignity.</p>
            <p>They suppose also that these Forms do mightily endammage and prejudice the Liberty of Churches, or Conscience and Prophesie; for that where they are admitted into the Church, it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble but that forthwith a tyrannical Law be brought in at the back door, so that a man may not think, speak, write, teach, compare and interpret the Scriptu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es but according to what they prescribe; and to call them into doubt, or to contradict them, though modestly, is thought an heinous wickedness. Nor do they want their pretence: <hi>viz.</hi> That the publick Peace of the Church may be preserved entire, Confusion avoided, and Liberty
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:63915:9"/>
turn not into Licentiousness: from whence further (they say) it comes to pass, that none, (especially if it be believed that the Common-Wealth also is inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ressed therein) durst either inquire into those Formes, and examine the Opinions that are contained in them by the stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of Truth, or if any one called upon for parts and industry for that end shall inquire into them, and in his judgment find some things to be false, he cannot without apparent danger publish, and discover them for the amendment of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. And that indeed by this means such like Forms of Confessions and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations did terminate in most rigid bonds, and more than Adamantine Fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, wherewith Liberty together with Truth are most straitly tied up, and that Errour, which is once received and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, becomes stable and firm, yea eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</p>
            <p>Lastly, they affirm that a large gap is opened by these very Confessions and Declarations for Schisms and Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; because (as they have been hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to used) they have been the open and publick signs of dissensions, by which,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:63915:9"/>
no otherwise then by certain partition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walls, Christians, who ought to be most strictly joyned together, and who in very deed agree in the main of saving do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, are divided each from other, whilst one indeed saith, I am of <hi>Paul,</hi> another, <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 12.</note> I am of <hi>Cephas,</hi> another, I am of <hi>Apollos,</hi> another, I am of Christ: and every one believeth that the purity of Religion, and the hope of immortal life consisteth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his particular Congregation: So that whosoever belongeth not thereto, he is almost judged altogether excluded out of Heaven and the Kingdom of Jesus Christ. Whence it is necessary that there arise and flow, as it were from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Spring, perpetual and immortal ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treds, and divisions of minds and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
            <p>These for the most part are the chief <note place="margin">A general Answer.</note> props, on which the first and second sort rely, and whereby they support their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion: specious indeed they are, if viewed, at first sight, for that they make shew of no ordinary zeal for the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of God's Word, for Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, for the Peace and Concord of Churches: yet such, as if more nearly
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:63915:10"/>
looked into, have not appeared to us of so great weight, as that for their sakes we should deem our selves bound to desist from our purpose of publishing this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of ours. For doubtless they seem not undeservedly to reprove so much the thing it self, as the corruption and abuse of the thing, which (as a Wen to a fair body) oftentimes is wont to grow and cleave even unto those things, which are best and most sovereignly wholesome in themselves, and through a more sharp viewing of the vice, and otherwise most just hatred of the abuse to be carried and fall unawars even into a detestation of the very thing it self. Which that it may be plain, it will be worth our labour to premise some what of the nature, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, utility and right use of Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions or Declarations. For from thence it will most clearly appear and become manifest, both how greatly they are mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, who are wholly averse from them, and reject them one with another, and what is our end and scope in the putting forth of this. <note place="margin">What is the true use and end of Consessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note>
            </p>
            <p>As for Confessions then, or Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations in general, they are nothing but
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:63915:10"/>
clear and manifest expositions of our Faith propounded and laid down in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain method, wherein more or fewer, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>their by word or writing, discover their judgment concerning points of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion, and make it known to the Christian World, for the clearing up of Divine Truth, the cutting off Calumnies, where with innocent persons are oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and the edifying of Churches in true Faith and peace. This at length is the proper, true and genuine nature and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius of Confessions and Declarations, from which we are to make judgment of their true both necessity, and utility, and no ways from the disposition and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of those, who have oftentimes abused Confessions and Declarations to far o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther different ends. For those things have not been the faults of the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but of the Declarers, and not the uses, but abuses of Confessions, and they such as might easily but for our selves be severed from the Forms of Confessions themselves.</p>
            <p>That these kind of Forms indeed are <note place="margin">That they are not precisely necessary.</note> not precisely and absolutely necessary we willingly grant, and therefore do we not
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:63915:11"/>
like of their opinion, whom we mention'd in the fourth place, who account them at least for secondary Symbols of Faith, and who determine or maintain that they are precisely necessary, if not to the being, yet at least to the well-being of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church. For where a right and concordant or unanimous understanding of the Scriptures hath its place, there simply is no need of other Forms of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, or expressions, but what are in the Scriptures themselves: and those Forms which are in the Scriptures, they are suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient unto Faith and Salvation; and if one bring with him an honest, and docile mind, and studious of Divine Truth, for the discerning of them, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all use those means, which he ought to use, and which become a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der earnestly desirous of so great things, they are so clear and perspicuous, that they may and ought at all times a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly to suffice every Christian to draw from thence both for himself and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers a most perfect Declaration of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine meanings. For verily it cannot be justly doubted, but that those Forms and Phrases, wherein God himself and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:63915:11"/>
our Lord Jesus Christ were pleased long since to express and declare the meanings of their mind to private and ordinary and unlearned men, are also at this day suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for us to understand and declare those very same meanings; since to that end they are no less left of God and delivered by the Scripture to us than unto them, that from them we might draw and fetch those things, which concern the Worship of God, and our own and others everlasting Salvation. From whence it follows, that it is altogether possible, that the Church of Christ may not only be, but that it may also well be without such like humane Forms.</p>
            <p>In the mean time though such Forms <note place="margin">That yet they are useful and lawful.</note> are not precisely necessary, yet are they not therefore also to be judged unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and consequently unlawful and hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. For if Prophesyings, or Interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Scriptures are not unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yea rather if they be some-times in certain respects necessary, which several Teachers and Pastours propose in Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities and Churches, or which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise are performed in Christian Assemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, when for the informing of the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,

            <p>Yea further, if you shall duly consider the matter without affection and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, <note place="margin">That they are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times also necessary.</note> we shall find that those times may happen, wherein such Declarations ought to seem not only profitable, but also very necessary.

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:63915:15"/>
our belief, or for such Forms, which do not define, or determine, what is to be held for true, or false, what is to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, or not to be believed, after what manner any thing is to be expressed, or uttered; but which only may make known and testifie, what they hold for true and false, what they believe, or do not believe, how they express the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of their Mind, whose own those Forms and Declarations are. For if they be had in no other account, or greater e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem, there is no danger that their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority (we say not) should be equalled, much less be preferred before the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but that they find not indeed any place, though the lowest in the Church. For doubeless, as we have already said before, they will not then be held for Squares and Rules of Faith, whereby Truth, or Falshood, Heresie, or Errour may and ought to be known; and which are published for that end, that by them what is true or false may be known, and discovered or sound; but only for bare Signals and Symbols or Tokens, which only show and declare, what the Authors believed and judged of those and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:63915:16"/>
Articles and Meanings of Christian Religion. And truly if we consult the ancient Annals of the Church, they who first put forth such Symbols, Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Canons, Confessions and Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, had no other design, aim or end, but thereby to testifie, not what was to be believed, but what they themselves believed; and that these Symbols, &amp;c. should be even instead of Watch-Towers, to declare &amp; shew to the unwary and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent the Shelves and Quicks of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours that were hurtful to Piety and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, or also to serve against Calumni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ators, for Apologies, whereby every one might understand, how far they were from those Errours, Blasphemies, and Crimes, which through Calumny were by men ill-imployed fastened upon them. And certainly if all Declarations and Confessions had at all times kept within these bounds, they had not indeed at any time, obtained any Dictator-like Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Authority, much less greater than, or equal to the Scriptures in the Church. Wherefore that the Church may in the first place alway hold this firm &amp; unalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, we are to endeavour again and again,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:63915:16"/>
and therefore ef<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

3. In Disputations, Conferences, Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations or Tryals men will never appeal to them, neither will controversies of Faith be brought to the Anvil thereof; but they will all wholly without fear or danger be brought to and examined by the Word of God alone, as the only Rule beyond all exception, and the true form of sound words, which our alone Master Jesus Christ and his Apostles have left unto us. And thus indeed there will be nothing, that can justly be desired to detract Divine Authority from them, and to give it wholly to the Sacred Scriptures. Neither shall we then need to fear, lest idols be made of them to be set up in the Church of Jesus Christ, and placed in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual degree with the Scriptures, or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured with any like honour with them, or lest bands should be knit of them, whereby the Consciences of men should be bound; or lastly lest poysons should be prepared of them, whereby the sincerity of Faith might be infected, or the Truth of Doctrine adulterated.</p>
            <p>This Foundation therefore once right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">For a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine them.</note> laid, and this Principle firmly suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, there will alwaies remain in the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:63915:17"/>
Church of Jesus Christ whole and entire a liberty, whereby any one may (pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving safe the Laws of Christian Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty, Charity and Prudence) without danger inquire into those Forms, and without scruple contradict them: that by this means there may be always a manifest difference between them and the Word of God, to which alone that priviledg ought to remain sacred and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violate, that it alone is above and beyond all Controversie and Contradiction, and that the Consciences of Believers are to be tyed to it only. And yet is not this liberty to be extended so far, as to turn into a dissolute and irregular licentious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, whereby every Man may unadvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly, speak what he please. For he as much abuseth liberty, who too much at pleasure loosenth the button thereof, as he who fastneth it too strait. All ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams are to be avoided, and we to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to moderation, which consisteth in the midst between Tyranny and a Wild and Unbridled Licentiousness. Therefore Prudence and Charity are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to be taken into Council, which will easily dictate, when and how this liberty
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:63915:18"/>
may profitably, and without the Scandal of the Godly, be made use of. It is the part of Prudence to weigh things, and to consider fit times and places, wherein this or that Opinion either by word or writing may commodiously be proposed. It is the part of Charity, to have a regard of persons, that they be not offended or troubled, who ought to be edified. It is not the duty of a Prudent and Pious Man, and one truly Charitable, to use promiscously, upon every occasion, with all Persons or in all Places, when he so thinks fit, the liberty of contradicting, nay nor alwaies &amp; everywhere patiently to bear with all the Contradictions of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. <note place="margin">Against the unbri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiousness of some.</note> There is often a regard to be had both of the Things or Opinions which are contradicted, and of the Persons with whom such Contradictions are propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. For there are some things of so great Weight and Moment, that they cannot be gain-said without the extream hazard of our Salvation. Freely to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict these, or quietly to suffer them to be contradicted by others, would be the farthest from Prudence and Charity possible. There are some things of that

To the one we must not give occasion of offence, lest they fall: From the other we must withhold all encouragements, lest they hurt themselves and others. For in this manner we ought alwaies to shun all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangerings of the Faithful, especially of the weak, lest we abuse our liberty to the destruction of any one, but use it aright and to the edification of all.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in estimation beneath those Forms. And indeed if we will but mind it, the chief and haply first step, whereby human<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Forms ascended to the height of an usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped Authority and Majesty almost Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, was this, that at the first they at tributed to the phrases, words, order and method thereof more than was meet; a if in them all sences to be believed, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and practised, were more clearly briefly and substantially exprest, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in those which we meet with in the Scriptures. For from hence hath the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem of them by little and little been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased, and that of the Scriptures les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sened: insomuch that according to the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:63915:20"/>
words, phrases, yea almost syllables and letters of the said Forms, and according to the method and peculiar order of the same they began to determine and declare touching the truth and falseness of almost all Opinions and Meanings; as if that could not be true, which did not exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and in every thing agree with them, and as if he could not be free from Heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, or at least from errour and falshood, who should (though never so modestly) contradict them, or go but a straws breadth from them, yea that should not almost swear unto the words thereof. The which pernicious abuse, and so manifest a corruption and inconvenience to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand and prevent, we ought at all times earnestly and almost only to inculate or repeat, that such Forms of Declarations are not made for that end for to teach, that the Sences or Meanings of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion may or ought most commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diously to be expressed in this order, in this method, in these phrases or manners of speaking, and not in others; but that in or by them they may be expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed rightly and commodiously enough, or that in the judgment of those very Men
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:63915:21"/>
that make such Confessions, they are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry exactly and truly contained in them. For so to use them will not be a matter of absolute necessity, but of meer liberty; and he that useth them, will indeed do well, and yet he will not be judged to do ill that useth them not, especially if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the sum of saving doctrine delivered in them, and do not condemn those who in this point dissent. <note place="margin">That they are not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits nor bounds within which Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is to be shut up.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The third thing, which flows from those things that have been already spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, necessary unto the right use of Forms, is this, That these Forms be not at any time held for limits and bounds, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in which Religion and the saving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of God is believed in such manner to consist, as if they, who cannot in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science assent to them or give their voice for them, were therefore excluded from Salvation, and shut out of the Kingdom of Heaven. Far be that from us, who firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe that Christians may unwitting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly err in many things without the loss of Salvation, and who judg that there are very few things, that are precisely neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to be known and believed for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Eternal Life. Wherefore that
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:63915:21"/>
we may demonstrate that this proud cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty is exceeding far from us, we do open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shew and declare, that Forms of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions and Declarations are to be had in no other respect or account, than for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Ensigns and Standards set up where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they declare, who set them fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th, that they judg, that those Sences, which are contained in those Forms, do come very near the Truth, and therefore, unless they were taught better, do heartily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire and wish, that all others that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous of Truth and Peace would em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace them, not indeed properly for this end, that so at length they might be saved, but that they might withdraw themselves from the danger of erring to the greatest distance may be. For neither ought it to seem enough to a Christian, to make to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Eternal Salvation by every means and in every way whatsoever: the safest and surest is to be chosen, except haply a just fear of some greater danger or scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal in the Church hinder the same. For the good of Eternal Hapiness and of an immortal life ought to be of so great price with him, that he ought to hate and carefully to shun all dangers, which
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:63915:22"/>
may turn away, or withdraw his mind from imbracing the same. Nor hath he any reason to fear, that he doth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore abet and patronize Schisme, which the Apostle calleth a work of the flesh. For if he haply depart from some Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations to others, he doth not forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with contemn those, which he leaveth, or judg them as excluded from the hope of Salvation, but only goes from those that are more impure to those that are more pure, that he may shew, that he hath a care and tender regard of every truth any ways serving to his own Salvation, and approve his Conscience unto God and our Lord Jesus Christ. Nevertheless in the mean while he does his endeavour sedulously to maintain Peace and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord with all that are truly pious, as fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

to the Christian Common-Wealth, yea and also sometimes necessary. From whence, they who would have them not only not necessary, but unprofitable, and consequently unlawful and hurtful, are worthy to be thought to cast an uncivil reproach upon them. For so far are they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>f themselves from derogating any thing from the Majesty of the Scriptures, that is, from their perfection and clearness, that on the contrary the true authority thereof is no less confirmed and establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them, than by Prophesyings, or Expositions of the Scriptures. For seeing their truth, both as to their sence, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of expression, and method, is to be asserted and maintained from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures themselves, yea seeing the said very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orms do profess, that all and every one may and ought freely to do the same, and consequently do remit or send us back from themselves to the Scriptures, and expresly command us to appeal to them alone in all Controversies whatsoever, certainly they ought not to be thought to confer unto the shaking or subverting, but on the contrary to the establishing of the Authority of the Scriptures. Nor
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:63915:23"/>
do they in the least prejudice the liberty of Churches, since none is precisely bound unto them, yea seeing it is freely granted to every one to try them by the Standard of the Word of God; lastly, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every one may without danger or fear contradict them sobeit onely there be a careful regard had of Prudence, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Modesty. Nor indeed do they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen any gap to Schisms and Separations. For neither is he to be thought to make a Schism, that joyneth himself to those Assemblies, wherein he seeth greater pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Doctrine, and Holiness of life to flourish and thrive, sobeit he do not proudly dispise other Assemblies, and forthwith judg them excluded out of Heaven, or from the Hope of Eternal Life, whom he sees somewhat more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stranged from his own Society. For Christian Peace and Concord may conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue entire, yea and also ought, amongst Congregations divided and distinguished in or by Opinions, so that the fault be not in us, that all those, who hitherto hold all things necessary to Salvation, and do not obstinately press Doctrines or O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions prejudicial to Godliness, do not
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:63915:23"/>
agree together, and imbrace each other with mutual Charity and brotherly Love in the Lord Jesus. But if we hinder those Churches from growing together and being consolidated into one body, which might and ought to grow and be consolidated together, or if being united and joyned together, we unnecessarily divide them, and separate them into par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, then indeed make we our selves guilty of Schism, and deserve to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached with God of disturbing Peace and Concord: which is so true, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle seems noless to make or prove them guilty of Schism, who gloried that they were of Christ, no less, I say, at least, than others, who said that they were of <hi>Paul,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1 12.</note> or of <hi>Apollos,</hi> or <hi>Cephas,</hi> for that those despised these in comparison of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and did as it were think it scorn that they should be compared with them, yea did reject them as it were strangers from Christ. Insomuch that the desire of Truth, though the best and wholsomest, doth not excuse any Man from the crime of Schism, at least before God himself, unless it be accompanied with a true love of Peace and Concord, and an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:63915:24"/>
after mutual good will. For of so great price with God is the true Peace and Concord of his Church, that he is even displeased with a seditious Truth, or a schismatical and turbulent manner of propagating the same.</p>
            <p>And yet we deny not, but that it may <note place="margin">Of b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For he that is evil and imprudent may sometimes abuse in the worst sort the very best things, as
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:63915:24"/>
on the contrary, a good and prudent Man may use well a thing that is evil and hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in it selfe, and improve it for a whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some remedy at some turns. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more in the next place, it hardly falleth out, but that, if such Forms of Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations be not sometimes set forth, a wide gap is opened unto other miscarria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and inconveniences, if not more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, yet at least alike and equal, and a way is easily pav'd unto a dissolute li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiousness of foolishly venting every thing, at least no better than tyranny: Lastly seeing by that means, which we have spoken of, we may timously with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand those miscarriages and inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies, which some think will arise from thence. For if those, who have thought meet to set forth Confessions and Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of their belief, had always kept within the said use of them, they had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had place given them for their exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive authority in the Church. But after that an exact account ceased to be had thereof, their Authority began by little and little, and as it were by degrees to be advanced, insomuch that the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, Eyes, Tongues and Pens of Men
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:63915:25"/>
became to depend on them, as upon cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Standards, and undoubted Rules of Faith. Whence afterward it came to pass, that some by means of them, as it were by certain letters of Heraulds at Arms, have denounced War against all other Congregations, and that they might have no hope of reconcilement left them, the assemblies of Christians thereby have been divided and separated one from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, even as Empires heretofore by Boundaries, and Enemies Camps by Trenches and Bulwarks. Lastly, which is the utmost line of Tyranny, that they have punished those, who did contradict these Forms with Force and Sword, and that with so great a zeal and heat, yea fury, that, when prophane Persons, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, Dispisers of the Scriptures and Atheists are upon very easy terms pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, these alone are destined to Prisons, Racks, Wheels, Gallowses, Crosses, Flames, and all the most exquisite punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and torments imaginable, and all for this only end, that the Authority of these Forms may be freed from contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, and vindicated from contempt, and by that means forsooth the outward
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:63915:25"/>
Peace of the Church, and quiet of the Common-Wealth may be preserv'd undisturb'd. The which way of proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, as it ought most justly to be hated and abominated of all Christians, so hath it all along exceedingly disliked us, who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ilt easily understand, what was our end and aim, which we propounded to our selves in setting forth this Declaration. Indeed, the very same we said before, and none other. For this Declaration is not put forth to that intent, that thereby a new snare of Consciences should be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, or a constant Square and Rule of Faith and Doctrine prescribed to any, to wit, which should absolutely bind the Consciences of Men before God, and therefore none should depart from it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the least, to wit, neither in Matter nor in Words, nay nor in method or manner of Teaching. Far be so proud a
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:63915:26"/>
vanity from us, who know that this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour agreeth not with any Writings of Men, how accurate soever, and diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and long and much considered, but only with the Word of God contained in the Holy Scriptures; and who both know that from the abuse of such Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, which is too frequent and too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, new Schisms, Sects, Condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Persecutions, and other Scandals of that kind have more often arisen, and do seriously bewail the same. And this was our principal aim, To satisfie the often earnest requests of those, who judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that we owed this Service both to the Church and Common-Wealth, and indeed for to promote the Publick good, that is, both for the more ample illustrating the Truth of God, and for the the more happy procuring and on every side propagating of Peace in them both. Another end is, that we might by this means the more commodiously vindicate the truth of our Opinions and our Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency against the inique accusations of those, who when as themselves hold grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and very hurtful errours, among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that in the first place concerning fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:63915:26"/>
Predestination, and other points an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>next thereto, (as also concerning the killing of Hereticks) yet will be thought the only Orthodox Men, and the altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pure Reformed, and stick not to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten upon us not only Errours, but also Heresies and Blaspemies, yea who while themselves exercise new dominion in the Church, and do not only cause Schisms and Sects, but do also every where raise up direful Persecutions and Banishments against harmless Men, do nevertheless complain of us (whom having in part in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed cited in their Conventicle of <hi>Dort,</hi> they very lately condemned, yet unheard, and without making our defence) more than Calumniously as of the true Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors forsooth of all the Scandals and Disturbances, that have been hitherto made in the <hi>Belgick</hi> Churches. For the fuller conviction therefore of these Men, before God and the whole Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian World, of their manifest calumnie, and manifold injustice hitherto used a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us, and withal for the truer infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of all that are pious, and lovers or studious of the Truth of God and the Churches Peace, we have thought not
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:63915:27"/>
without weighty and just cause, that we were bound to set forth this publick and unanimous Declaration of our judgment touching almost the whole Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. In the sraming indeed whereof we have first of all diligently endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that there might not be omitted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in any Opinion or Doctrine, either ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, or very useful, and that there might not be any thing, either false, or confused, or lastly any thing idle and superfluous contained in the same. But that it might comprehend in it the very form of sound, or rather of healing words, which abundantly express unto us Christian Faith and Piety, both briefly and plainly, and no less methodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, and as it were in a brief survey hold forth the whole thereof to be viewed of all: and that by the unanimous consent of all the Brethren, (not so much as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting those who are held shut up in Goals) all which jointly and severally diligently read it before, and in the fear of the Lord examined it by the rule of the Holy Scripture, as far as they might by reason of the iniquity of the times, and at length with one Heart and one
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:63915:27"/>
Mouth did all approve of it.</p>
            <p>And indeed we have called it not only <note place="margin">Against the Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of some.</note> a Confession of our Faith, but also a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of our Mind and Judgment, for that such a Declaration promiseth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more full and pregnant, than a bare Confession of Faith alone doth: For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we were willing to satisfie the hope and expectation of those, who desired a more copious, full, and clear exposition or unfolding of our Judgment concerning for the most part all the Articles of the Christian Religion: and withal also to put a bolt upon the mouth of those, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving nothing justly to carp at in us, would perswade the people, that we would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver agree together upon any common, clear and uniform Judgment touching the chief heads of Religion: that we did conceal some things, of which we were ashamed to give our judgment in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and that they were such, which did overthrow the very chief heads, and as it were the <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:63915:28"/>
or some general and deceitful coverings of words.</p>
            <p>This false accusation of theirs, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though long since elsewhere often detect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and sufficiently refuted by us, yet had we rather obviate it even by a publick and general Declaration of our Belief, than by other means more lyable to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnie. So secure is a good Conscience and the Confidence of a good Cause, which we have thought worth our while, even upon this occasion publickly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare. And this among others was a cause, why we conceived or framed it not in meer Scripture-Words, lest we should indeed nourish that suspition, to wit, that we sought lurking Holes, and hid, as some indeed think, mischievous and prophane meanings under an equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal covering of the words of the Sacred Scripture: and that we might by this means cut off all new matter of calumni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating from those, whose solemn study and chief labour it is to blu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

As to thorny and too subtile questions, <note place="margin">Of the matter of this Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssion.</note> which are proper to your Universities and Schools, and which neither advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage the knower, nor prejudice the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, we have purposedly waved them, leaving them to idle and to curious Wits, and which are troubled with an incurable evil habit of disputing, to whom it is matter of pleasure to make shew of their acuteness; and from this kind of paste, made to comfort the stomach with, to seek or purchase to themselves the pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Garland of Victory. We have bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our time and service on that Truth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, which is according to Godliness, and indeed in conjunction with an inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous and open simplicity, the which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Unlearned may understand, and the Learned ought not to disdain. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we have thought it best and safest, to keep within the bounds of things necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and in our judgment profitable, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and passing all other things of set purpose, and that indeed the more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiously to avoid both the extreams, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wit, the excess, and the defect. For nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Against the third sort of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters.</note> do we like their Opinion, who will have nothing contained in Consessions

               </gap> those things that are profitable also, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially of those, which in this kind ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel the rest, and as it were lead and guide the Family. For these, like Spurs and Goads, mightily excite and put forward the will, the more freely and cheerfully to mind and endeavour after a love and observation of those things that are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary. From hence wee se it sometimes come to pass, that some things, which are not indeed precisely necessary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, do nevertheless draw after them strong motions of minds, and do strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incline and bow by their weight our affections and whole will to this side or part or to the other, so that he who sets his foot less aright, or less firmly in them, is upon a light occasion put by the stayd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of a right mind, and easily like a restless wave, driven this way and that way. Wherefore although it be not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely necessary for all to know them, yet to be willing not to know, or some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to be simply ignorant of them, is dangerous, and often times very hurtful.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:63915:29"/>
And we have directed all things to the <note place="margin">What heads her<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> are chiefly expounded, and why.</note> practice of Christian Piety. For we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that true Divinity is meerly practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and not either simply, or for its greatest or chiefer part speculative, and therefore whatever things are delivered therein, ought to be referred thither on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that a man may be the more strongly and fitly inflam'd and encouraged to a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent performauce of his duty, and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Commandments of Jesus Christ. For it is a dry, decayed, barren, and consequently spurious Divinity, which consists within the bounds of an empty speculation, and meer contemplation, and which, after it hath a long time greatly wearyed the diligence of every the most vigilant, and with pain exercised his wit only, doth not yet reach to his will, and beget therein a due obedience unto God; and therefore worketh not in us a true and saving knowledg of God and Christ. For he that saith, that he knows God, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> keepeth not his Commandments, he <note place="margin">1 John. 2. 4.</note> is a lyer, and the Truth is not in him. The first therefore and chiefest praise of Theologie consists in this, that it bows the Heart of Man unto an Obedience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:63915:30"/>
God, and so inclines or bends that part of us, which God hath endowed with a natural liberty, and made as it were to be at its own pleasure and dispose, that it do again of its own accord subject it self wholly unto God, and abandoning the former abuse of its own liberty, doth only follow the ducture of the will of God. All other things, unless they be directed to this mark, are before God vain and fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous, and of themselves of the least price, and consequently in a manner no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be esteemed. The knowledg therefore of them, is neither necessary, nor profitable farther, than so far as it may and is wont to serve unto this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal scope or design.</p>
            <p>For this very cause also, those things <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Of the five controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted points in</hi> Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> which pertain to the five Articles, as they call them, to wit of Predestination, and the heads annext thereto, we have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more largely expounded them, and here and there diligently intermingled with other things. For if there be any Articles of our Faith, which are very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, and in a manner absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary unto practice, or for the inculca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and begetting in us an observation
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:63915:30"/>
or keeping of the Commands of Jesus Christ, these at least are to be accounted such. For these are every where and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versly scattered or spread abroad through out the whole body of Divinity, as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain nourishments, yea as it were Sinews, small strings, Arteries and Veins, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by our Spirit is effectually moved unto the exercise of Piety, and kept, nourished and cherished, yea continually carryed and put forward in the same: and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently strongly engaged unto a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual progress therein. Which also was the cause, why we have every where here and there, where the matter so required, with reasons also added, openly rejected the contrary Articles unhappily establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> as some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy cockle-weed and tares that are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hurtful to true Piety and Holiness, yea as the foul blots and spots of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion, which all pious people ought no otherwise to detest, then botches and imposthumes, wholy sucking up the whole juice, bloud and vigour of Goodness and Honesty, and drawing them out of our souls, to nourish themselves. For there is nothing so much an Enemy to Religion,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:63915:31"/>
as that fictitious fate of Predestination, and unavoidable necessity of obeying and offending. We had yet another cause of this our doing, to wit, that by this means we might testifie and declare to the whole Christian World, how just and weighty causes moved us, why we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned their Opinion, who obstinately and stiffly urged the said fatal Predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as the chief basis, as indeed it is, or <note n="*" place="margin">

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:63915:31"/>
which were but a little before every where after an unusual manner for a great part altered and changed, to be cast out of our Country, and Banished for ever, for that, being moved only with Religion and Conscience, we could not promise, that we would keep in everlasting silence that our Opinion, and that we would no where, whether privately or publickly, whether directly or indirectly, whether upon occasion sought, or offered, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seminate the same, or inculcate it upon our Churches; being in other respects ready to perform and discharge all the duties of good Citizens and Subjects to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with our Country-Men: concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning both which proceedings, both Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical and Civil, no doubt but God and his Church in their due time will judg far otherwise, than our adversaries desire or expect.</p>
            <p>Lastly, we have no where added to <note place="margin">

For we know, how ready a matter it is, in so great a multitude of Opinions, so great a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of those that err, so great a variety of wits or dispositions, so great a plenty of hinderances and scruples, so great weakness of judgments, in such to slip and err: and how easy it is by arguments true in appearance to be deceived, and mistaken: how harmless also it is in it self to err and to mistake in many things: how great also clemency and kindness God is like to use towards such as simply err, who pardoneth and remitteth even willful sins themselves to those that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and how aliene or far from the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and meek disposition of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus it is, not to pittie those that stray: Lastly how sad and tragical disturbances that both rash and proud confidence of condemning hath at all times occasioned and made. For <hi>Anathema's</hi> are wont to provoke <hi>Anathema's,</hi> and where this
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:63915:33"/>
chance is once cast, all's past, and there is an end of all hope of remedy. For the direful hatreds of parties suceed, and the reins of hatreds being let loose, they commonly at length with deadly and <note place="margin">An exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to the study of peace, moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance.</note> spiteful minds rush upon the slaughter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Butchering of one another, and the last fruit of these Condemnings and Anathematizings is, an everlasting des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair of cure.

                  </note> three things offer themselves necessarily to be considered and held by us; his Nature, Works, and Will. The Nature indeed of God, that we may understand, that he is of or in himself most worthy to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shiped of us: his Works, that we may

Howbeit concerning the <note place="margin">But not equally, or alike ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.</note> Nature and Works of God, all those things are not necessarily to be held, which in every respect, at least whatsoever belongs to the Divine Essence, and all the modes or manners of its working and kinds of operations: much less all those things, which either according to the likely and specious placits of the Schools, or from the probable discourse of Reason, are wont to be affirmed of them: but those only, without which the Divine Will, revealed in the Scriptures either cannot be rightly understood, or performed by <note place="margin">A twofold knowledge of God.</note> us: Since they only, who do the will of God and <note n="‖" place="margin">Job 28. 28.

For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed God cannot of right require, that a Man should wholly devest himself of the exercise of his Liberty, which he received by Creation, and deprive him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self of the use and enjoyment of divers pleasures, and in all things subject him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to the Will of another, to or with his greatest labour and trouble: if he have now before-hand, for no fault of his own foregoing, determined to inflict upon him a far greater and more grevous Evil, then that Good is which he gave him by Creation: nay, if he therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed on him that temporal and lighter Good, that he might under some pretence inflict upon him an Eternal and truly lamentable Evil absolutely destinated to him before.

For the Elect as they call them, or those who are predestinated unto Life, have no need of any such Expiation and Reconciliation; because upon the very account of their being precisely or absolutely elected un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Salvation, they are likewise upon the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:63915:73"/>
same account in actual Favour with God, and already necessarily beloved of him, with the highest and immutable Love, and such as is peculiar to those that are Sons and Heirs of God. And as for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate, as they call them, they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves deny that there was, or is any Atonement truly made for them; and besides, the thing is absurd of it self, as that which implyes a contradiction. For upon their being reprobated, according to these Mens Opinion, they are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon wholly and altogether excluded from the Atonement made by Christ. Because those, whom God hath by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable Decree once reprobated or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from Salvation, or devoted to to eternal Destruction, he doth not seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously will, nor can will, that any thing savingly good should really be conferred upon them, much less that the said A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement should be common to them with the Elect. And thus far in general of the chief Works of God hitherto.</p>

performed; and under the threatning of the forest punishment, if it be neglected. For in vain and without cause doth he command this Obedience, and require it of another, and promise to reward the Obedience, who himself both ought and will work the very act of Obedience by such a force as cannot be resisted; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eptly &amp; against reason is he rewarded, as one truly and really Obedient, in whom this very Obedience is effected by such a kind of force of another's.

               <head>The Conclusion.</head>
               <p>And this at length is our judgment of all, or at least of the chief Articles of Christian Religion, whereby Christian Reader, whoever you are, you may easily understand, and most clearly see, that we are free and clear from all those Heresies, Schismes and other noisom and ungodly Opinions, which have been hitherto by our Adversaries slanderously fastened up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us: And that we do not dig up again, or, as they say, hang up upon a new Post or Pole any erroneous Opinious and such as have been condemned by the ancient and first Professors of Christianity: also that we do not shake, nor subvert those things, which have been at any time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished by the Church of Christ by uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal consent: that we do not define, nor obstinately and proudly decide in those things, which have long since been dubiously controverted to and fro, and which make not greatly either for the promoting of the Glory of God, or of our own Salvation or our Neighbour's: fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally that we do not operously &amp; subtilly seatch into those things, which are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to us: lest indeed we intrude our
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:63915:135"/>
selves into those things, which the most wise God would have to be kept secret. But that we make this our only and sole endeavour, that we may preserve whole and entire that Truth, which is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Godliness, and which it concerns us all solidly for to know, and that we e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where pursue, and, as much as in us lyeth, promote those things which make, both for the maintaining or cherishing, and promoting of mutual Peace and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord amongst Christians; always remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring that advice of the Apostle's, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 8. <hi>This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou constantly affirm</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>that they which have believed in God be careful to maintain</hi> (or go before, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel others in) <hi>good Works. For these are good,</hi> (excellent) <hi>and profitable to</hi> (for) <hi>Men:</hi> and that which the Apostle else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where exhorteth unto; <hi>Follow ye peace with all Men, and Holiness; without which no Man shall see the Lord,</hi> Heb. 12. 14. In these two is placed the chiefest Glory of the Christian Religion. With these therefore hitherto we are wholly taken up. But about things unnecessary, and not greatly profitable to Salvation, we are loth to draw to and fro the Saw of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:63915:136"/>
and the Mysteries indeed, that are sublime &amp; abstruse, we receive with a sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Faith and free from all scrupulous sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilness of Wit and Reason, nor but soberly and sparingly, and as one of the Ancients is reported not unfitly to have said, we handle not the burning Iron without Tongs. And as for unprofitable Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and vain Niceties, we keep at the farthest distance from them, for that they rather gender or produce strifes and que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions, <hi>than godly edifying which is by Faith,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 4. Concerning things indifferent, as also Rites and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, we lightly trouble no Man, so that the offending of the Weak be diligently avoided on the one hand, and Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion carefully provided against on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Finally, we direct all our studies to this mark, that we may hold forth those things which are either necessary, or very profitable to substantial Piety and our own everlasting Salvation, and that in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things we may willingly and readily tolerate and bear with all that dissent from us, and heartily follow, maintain and cherish peace and concord in all the Churches of Jesus Christ, although in our opinion or judgment they are out of the
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:63915:136"/>
way. Which things being so, we earnestly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat and beseech you by the Lord, (Christian Reader, whoever you are) that you would not give any room with your self unto any suspicions to the contrary, nor admit of the unjust Accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Calumnies and Slanders of our Enemies, or easily harken unto those, whose chiefest interest it is that we should be evil spoken of, lest they should seem to have condemned and banished us undeservedly, and as innocent: but that having a careful regard to Right and Equity, you would pass judgment of us according to this our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession and publick Declaration of our Belief. If in any thing haply you suppose or believe us to err, instruct us in the Spirit of Gentleness and Meeekness, which most highly becometh the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Jesus Christ. We are ready in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and at all times, to yeild to those who shall shew us better, and give place to the Truth of God, which is more precious to us than all things else. If at any time notwithstanding, or in any place, we dissent and differ in things not necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be known, let us bear with one another in the Lord; and being mindful both of Christian Charity and Prudence, let us study to keep the unity of the Spirit through or in the bond of Peace, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 3. Nevertheless in that, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto by the help and guidance of Christ we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:63915:137"/>
and be alike minded or affected. <hi>and if in any thing we be otherwise-minded, God will reveal even this unto us.</hi> Phil. 3. 15, 16.</p>
               <p>Grant he, that we may daily more and more to his Glory grow and make progress in true Faith, Piety, Charity, Prudence, Gentleness, Meekness, and other holy Endowments and Christian Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and endeavour patiently to bear with, and gently or mildly to amend one anothers Infirmiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Errors, and Failings, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rooted and grounded in Love, we <note place="margin">Eph. 3. 17, 18, 19, 20, 21.</note> may be able together with all Saints to apprehend, what is that breadth, and length, and depth and heighth and that love of Jesus Christ which passeth all understanding, that so we may be filled even unto or with the whole fulness of God. To him, who with infinite redundan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is able to do above all those things which we ask or think, according to that power which worketh in us, to him, we say, be Glory in the Church by Christ Jesus, throughout all ages, World without end.</p>
