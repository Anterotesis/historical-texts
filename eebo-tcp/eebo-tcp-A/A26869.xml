            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>Nicodemus</hi> answered and said unto him; How can these things be?</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the beginning of this Chapter you have a Lecture read by the Great Teacher of the Church, to a Scholar that was newly entring into his School He is yet but a <hi>Catechumenus</hi> in prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be a <hi>Christian,</hi> rather then <hi>one</hi> indeed; having good thoughts of Christ, but not believing in him as the <hi>Messiah,</hi> nor engaged by Baptism to be one of his Disciples: And accordingly doth Christ suit his Doctrine to his condition, and teach him first the great Principle of Christianity. What success it had at first, we finde in the Text, but not
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57536:4"/>
what was the issue at last: Though by other Texts we may probably conjecture.</p>
            <p>First, The Schollar is by name, <hi>Nicodemus;</hi> by Sect, a Pharisee; by place, a Ruler of the Jews, or one of their great Council. For the frame of his minde, the degree of his preparatory know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or belief, you may discern it; 1. By the season of his coming; 2. By the motive that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with him to come; And 3. by the confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that he makes of his belief. From all which you may see, first, that he believed that there was a God, and that it belonged to God to teach mankinde; and that it was his way to teach by men; and that it was mans duty to seek after Gods teaching from his Messengers, and come to them and request it; and that who ever could give sufficient evidence of his Mission from God, should be heard by men; and that Jesus Christ did truly and undoubtedly work Miracles; and that such Miracles as Christ wrought, were an undoubted proof, that God was with him. All these things it is apparent he did believe by these words, Vers. 2. [<hi>Rabbi we know that thou art a Teacher come from God; for no man can do th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>se miracles that thou dost, except God be with him.</hi>]</p>
            <p>Secondly, From hence also you see, that it was the evidence of Christs Miracles, that had thus far convinced him, and drove him to Christ, as a Teacher come from God, and consequently one that was to be credited: But that he was the Messiah, here is yet no confession.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, And as his belief was but preparatory, so this change upon his heart doth appear to be
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57536:4"/>
no better: For he hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>t yet learned the lesson of Self-denial, and preferring the known truth and duty (of seeking after the minde of God from his Messengers) before the credit of the world, or his life; and therefore he comes to Jesus but by night, as being afraid to own him in the face of his enemies.</p>
            <p>Yet doth not Christ cast this cowardize in his teeth to his discouragement, but fitteth his medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine to the strength of the Patient, as well as to the disease: For there was more malice and raging zeal against the truth, among the Jews, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Gentiles; and so more dangers and sufferings, which a novice might not be so fit to encounter with. And therefore <hi>Paul</hi> when he went up to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> did Preach the Gospel pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately to them of worldly reputation, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Gentiles, and inferior Jews, he preacheth publickly; lest through the prevalency of mens pride or cowardize, his physick should not do its work, but he should run or labor in vain, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 2.</p>
            <p>The first and great thing that Christ presently falls upon, is to let this man know, that this much will not serve his turn (to confess the Miracles, and so the Divine Mission of Christ;) but that he must also truly believe the office that he is sent upon, even to be the Messiah, the Mediator; and the Redeemer of the World, and must openly be engaged to him as such a one by Baptism, and so own him and confess him before the World, and receive his renewing Spirit, for the illumination of his understanding, the purifying and quicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57536:5"/>
of his heart, and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>reforming, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guidance of his life.</p>
            <p>This work Christ calleth by the name of the New-Birth or Regeneration, and tells <hi>Nicodemus, [That except he be born again of water, and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi>] Not that there is the same necessity of the wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by water, and the purifying by the Spirit. For by [<hi>water</hi>] is principally meant that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant which Baptism did sign; even the confession of Christ, and dedication to him in the relation of redeemed Ones, Children, Disciples, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, on our part; and his re-engagement and relation to us: Yet [<hi>water</hi>] it self is the thing nearly signified in the Word, and the use of it is of Divine appointment, and not to be neglected where it may be used; but the necessity to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is placed in the relation or thing signified. As its common to say to a Souldier of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, [<hi>If thou wilt change thy General, and take the Princes Colours and fight for him, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> maist have pardon for thy rebellion.</hi>] Where [<hi>taking Colours</hi>] is a duty; but the necessity is placed in the change of his relation and practice; for if there were no Colours at hand to give him, yet if he be listed as a Soldier (or if not listed, yet if by open profession and action, joyned to them) it will be accepted; or else as <hi>Gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tius</hi> expoundeth it, by [<hi>Water and the Spirit</hi>] is meant, a washing, clensing Spirit; of which, see him in <hi>Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This change that is here called the [<hi>New birth</hi>] is not the new Creation of a substance, or destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of our former substance, or faculties: For
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57536:5"/>
we have still the same natural powers of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing and willing; But it is the change of the Disposition, Habits, and Acts of those faculties: And (with submission to the contrary minded, I conceive that) it is not onely our real qualitative change that is here called <hi>the New-birth;</hi> but that the word is more comprehensive (as I before exprest) including our new relation to God in Christ, as Sons and Disciples to Christ, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, Subjects, or Soldiers under him; with a removal from our former relations which we were in by corruption, and are inconsistent with these: So that it comprehendeth both our new relations to God, to the Redeemer, and to his Church; where we have a new Father, Husband, Lord, and Fellow-servants; new Brothers, and Sisters, and Inheritance (though yet we renounce not our Natural Brethren, Parents, and Inheritance, as the Popish Monastical Votaries conceive, any further then as they are contrary to the Interest of Christ.)</p>
            <p>The Reasons that perswade me to take Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in this extent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are,</p>
            <p>First, Because it is the entrance into our whole New State that is here so called, without any li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting expression.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Because we are said to be born of [<hi>Water</hi>] as well as the Spirit: And certainly Baptism doth as nearly and truly signifie our Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and Relative Change, and new Covenant Engagements, and Adoption, and Church Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bership, as it doth our Qualitative Renovation. Nor do I see how any fair Exposition can be given
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57536:6"/>
of that saying [<hi>Except a man be born of Water</hi>] which shall not include the change of our relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as well as of our dispositions. And the like I may say of other Texts, which mention Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which I will not now so far digress as to recite.</p>
            <p>Having seen what Christ teacheth <hi>Nicodemus</hi> first, let us next see the success of his doctrine. <hi>Nicodemus</hi> fastening too much upon the Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorical term of being [<hi>born again,</hi>] and withal not understanding the meaning of it, nor the scope of Christ, he presently expresseth his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and unbelief by this question, [<hi>How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter the second time into his mothers womb, and be born?</hi>] Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Christ returning an Explicatory Answer, telling him not onely the nature of the <hi>new birth,</hi> but also the mysteriousness of its causes in the effecting of it, and shewing a plain reason from Natural Agents, Why the mysteriousness of this should not make it seem incredible; yet doth <hi>Nicodemus</hi> return a second Answer like the first [<hi>How can these things be?</hi>] Which words do im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port not an absolute unbelief of the truth of what Christ had said, but a great ignorance of his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and a not discerning of that evidence fully, which should have caused full belief; but a strong apprehension of the improbability of the thing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, and thereupon a great doubting of the truth of the affirmation.</p>
            <p>And note here the aggravations of <hi>Nicodemus</hi> his fault, first, They were the words of one that he himself confessed to be a teacher come from
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57536:6"/>
God, and that sealed his Doctrine by such Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles as none could do, except God were with him. And doth God send any Messenger with a lie? or any Teacher that knoweth not what he teacheth? or will he seal untruths, or senseless absurdities, with such unquestionable miracles? Sure a man that was once convinced, that God sent the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger, and sealed the message, should be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the matter of it is divine, and should never once suspect it of untruth!</p>
            <p>Secondly, Though Christ did with frequent asseverations, aver the truth of his Doctrine, yet did <hi>Nicodemus</hi> stagger through unbelief.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It was the very Catechism and Rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Piety, and Christianity which was so strange to him.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The term by which Christ expresseth <hi>Spiritual things,</hi> he understandeth all in a carnal sense; yea, and after that Christ had told him plainly what birth he means, not carnal, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing a fleshly Creature, but of Water and the Spirit, producing a Spiritual Creature, yet doth not <hi>Nicodemus</hi> understand him for all this.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Yet was this man a Ruler of the Jews, even one of the great Sanedrim, and one reputed skilful in the Law; one that professed himself a guide of the blinde, a light of them which are in darkness, an instructer of the foolish, a teacher of Babes, which had the form of knowledge, and of the truth in the Law; one of those that boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God, and of the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 17, 18, 19, 20. Yet he that should teach others, had not learnt these Rudiments himself.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:57536:7"/>Sixthly, And when Christ used a familiar in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, to shew him that things are not therefore incredible, because invisible, or because we know not the nature, cause, and end of them. We may know <hi>that it is,</hi> when we cannot know <hi>what is it,</hi> or <hi>whence,</hi> or <hi>why</hi> it is, or <hi>whether</hi> it tends, as in the blowing of the wind is evident; yet doth not <hi>Nicodemus</hi> cease his doubting, on this account, but asketh, [<hi>How can these things be?</hi>] the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuality, and mysteriousness of the thing, made it seem improbable to his uninformed intellect; and the seeming improbability made him doubt of the verity. Because it was past his apprehension to conceive, <hi>how</hi> it should be, therefore he doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whether it were true, or not: He had not so much rational consciousness of his own ignorance, or so much confidence in a Teacher sent from God, and sealing his Doctrine by Miracles, as to acquiesce as a Learner in his Teachers credit, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the verity of the thing, while he was seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to get a clearer discovery of its nature, rise, and ends.</p>
            <p>So that here were all these sins together mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested in this answer, Great ignorance, even in a Ruler, unbelief, doubting of the conclusion, when he had acknowledged the premises; an unteach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness (in part) when he professed himself to come to learn; an arrogant conceit of the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciousness of his understanding, as if Christs words, or the plain truth should be sooner suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then his shallow capacity.</p>
            <p>From this Picture we may well conclude what is the ordinary shape of mans corrupted dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57536:7"/>
and we may all know our selves by know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Nicodemus.</hi> And from hence I may raise this Observation of us all.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> The corrupt nature of man is more pron<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> to question the truth of Gods Word, then to se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and confess their own ignorance and incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city; and ready to doubt, whether the things that Christ revealeth are true, when they themselves do not know the nature, cause, and reason of them.</q>
            <p>They will make every thing which they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand not, to seem improbable; and all such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probabilities will make it seem incredible; and the incredibility of a part, makes the whole seem incredible: And thus men will be Infidels, or seed their infidelity by every thing that themselves are ignorant of; and make it the chief reason why they will not believe or learn, because they do not already know, and fully understand the things to be learnt and believed. And so God must be accused in every thing that Moles and Worms are ignorant of.</p>
            <p>When the Jews acknowledged the Prophets to be of God, and sometime would profess to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and obey any message that God should send by them; yet when they heard what it was in particular which he sent, then if it did not suit with their interest and carnal Reason, they would not believe it, or obey it, but rather persecute the Messenger, and think that, sure such a message could never come from God. So that they must
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57536:8"/>
like the particular matter, before they would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that it was of God. And so Gods Word shall not be Gods Word, unless it please the blinde and carnal Reason of man.</p>
            <p>So you may finde they used the Prophet <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, Jere.</hi> 42. They intreat the Prophet to go for them to God, by prayer, and for advice, and binde themselves with seeming resolution to obey, saying, [<hi>The Lord be a true and faithful witness between us, if we do not even according to all things, for the which the Lord thy God shall send thee to us: Whether it be good, or whether it be evil, we will obey the voice of the Lord our God, to whom we send thee, that it may be well with us when we obey, &amp;c.</hi>] One would have thought that these men would have believed, and obeyed any thing that God should send to them, after such a vow as this: And yet when they heard that the message was contrary to their own mindes and opinions, Chap. 43. 1, 2. its said, That [<hi>all the proud men</hi>] gave this answer [<hi>Thou speakest falsly, the Lord our God hath not sent thee to say this.</hi>]</p>
            <p>A full instance you have of the like corrupt disposition, in <hi>John</hi> 6. When Christ doth but tell them that he is the Bread that came down from Heaven, the Jews murmur, Vers. 41. But when he insisted on it, that [<hi>He was the Living-Bread, and that he would give his Flesh for the life of the World, and that he that eateth him, should live for ever.</hi>] These Spiritual things they did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, but understood him carnally; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon reject the truth, because they understood it not. So that Vers. 52. they fall a striving among
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57536:8"/>
themselves against Christs words, saying, [<hi>How can this man give us his flesh to eat?</hi>] Even like <hi>Nicodemus [How can these things be?]</hi> they will not believe it <hi>is true,</hi> or that it <hi>can be,</hi> till they know themselves, <hi>How it can be?</hi> And when Christ yet pressed home the same mystery further, even some of his own [<hi>Disciples when they heard this, said, This is an hard saying, who can hear it.</hi>] Vers. 60. And though Christ proceed to open the mystery to them, and speak that more plainly which he had spoken Allegorically; yet its said, Vers. 66. That [<hi>From that time many of his Disciples went back, and walked no more with him;</hi>] insomuch, as he asketh the twelve, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they would go also? intimating the greatness of the number of revolters, upon this sleight oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion; forsooth, because he spake that which they understood not, and would have taught them what they had not, humility and patience enough to learn; and because they did not reach it at the first hearing, therefore they thought it improbable and incredible: Many more such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances we might give you from Scripture, but alas, it is a truth that needs no further proof; there are as many living witnesses of it, as there are men on earth; the unregenerate being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered by this corruption, and the regenerate weakned, and hindered much by the remnants of it.</p>
            <p>For the further improvement of this Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I shall, first, open further the nature and workings of this corruption; secondly, and then
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57536:9"/>
shew the Reasons of it; and lastly, make some Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of all.</p>
            <p>1. Sometime the weak intellect of man, is stalled at the quiddity or nature of things; and then being arrogant, as well as ignorant, it will not believe that there is such a thing, because he cannot reach to know what it is.</p>
            <p>On this account some question, whether man have an Immortal Soul, because they cannot reach to know (as they expect) what that Soul is. And some will not believe, that there is such a thing as the Spirit of God dwelling in his people, because they know not what that Spirit is: And some think that there is no such thing as inheren<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> sanctifying Grace, or the Image of God renewed upon the Souls of the regenerate; but that all talk of these Spiritual supernatural changes, are meer fancies and conceits; and all, because they know not what this sanctity and gracious inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is. They think there is no such thing as Communion with God, because they know not <hi>what it is;</hi> nor any such thing as a Spirit of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, because they know not <hi>what it is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed, if this were a wise and right rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning, then there should be nothing in Being, but what we know the formal nature of; which is as gross a conceit, as most in the World. What if you know not what an Angel or Spirit is? doth it follow that there is none? What if you know not what is beyond the visible Creatures out of sight? doth it follow, that there is nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond our sight? By this Rule, you may say, that there is no God; nay, all the World must needs
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57536:9"/>
say so, if this were right reasoning; for no man hath a true formal knowledge of Gods Essence; and therefore must say, there is no God, because they know not <hi>what God is:</hi> Nay, its a great que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, Whether such men must not deny the Being of almost all Gods Creation. For it is but little that we know of the forms of things, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of what we are ignorant of. You know not what the fire is, nor what the light is, nor what the air and wind is; for all the great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of the world, men are ignorant of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal nature of these. And will you therefore say, that there is no such thing as fire, or light, or air or wind? You know not the formal nature of the Sun or Moon; is there therefore no Sun or Moon. Alas, there is not a pile of grass, nor the smallest creeping thing, that you throughly know, and yet you know that such things there are. A Beast knows not what a Man is, and yet he apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that there is such a Creature: And no man throughly knoweth what he is himself, and yet he knoweth that he is.</p>
            <p>And for the Soul it self, it is a most easie and obvious truth, that we have such a Soul; but it is not so easie to give a definition of it. A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the way to know that you have eyes in your head, and eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight, is not by seeing those eyes or eye sight; but by seeing other things by them. For the eye was not made to see it self, nor do we see the sight of the eye; but by that eye and sight we see other things, and thereby know that we have eyes and sight. For he that hath not eyes and eye-sight, can see nothing at all; so the intellective Soul was
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57536:10"/>
not made directly to understand it self, and it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> own intellection; but to understand other things, and thereby to know that we have an intellectual Soul. For he that understandeth, doth under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand something, and thereby he understandeth that he doth understand, and so, that he hath an intellectual faculty: For he that hath not an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual Soul, can understand nothing at all; (yet I will not presume to determine the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie, Whether the Intellect do know its own, and the Wills elicit acts, by direct intuition of the act it self?) Its as unreasonable a thing then, to doubt whether we have such intellectual Souls, because they know not themselves directly o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> fully; as long as they know other things, as it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>3. Moreover, This folly of mans heart doth discover it self thus: In, that men will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the <hi>truths</hi> revealed by God, because they
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57536:11"/>
cannot see Gods Ends and Reasons, and the use of the things. Many an evident Truth is rejected by the proud wit of foolish man, because God hath not told them why he hath so determined and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the business; or if he have told it, yet they understand it not: So many Infidels and Socinians do deny Christs Satisfaction as a Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som, and Sacrifice for sin, because they cannot see any reason for it, or necessity of it: They cannot see, but God may pardon sin without satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. And then, what need of all this ado? or, what likelihood, that God would lay so much on his Son, or make so great a business of this work, for our good, and his glory, if all was needless? And thus many deny the Universal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of his satisfaction, as being for all mankinde, because they are not able to see the reason and use of it. They thrust in their dead <hi>quorsum</hi> as a sufficient answer to the most express words of God: And ask, what good will it do men to be ransomed, and not saved? They fear not to say, That this is a thing unbeseeming God, and such a weakness, as men would not be guilty of: So that if we can prove that such a thing there is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they will not fear to charge it on God as his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable weakness.

is special and proper to the Elect; and therefore some deny one, and some another. The like might be said of many other cases, wherein the Arrogancy of mans wit hath cast out Gods truth: If both parts be never so express, yet they are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this unbelieving questioning strain, [<hi>How can these things be?</hi>] How can these agree together? How can both be true? when yet its evident, that God hath owned both.</p>
            <p>It is certain, that the Truths of Gods Word are one perfect well joynted Body; and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect symmetry or proportion, is much of its beauty: It is certain, that Method is an excellent help in knowing Divine things: and that no man can know Gods truths perfectly, till he see them all as in one Scheam or Body, with one view, as it were, and so sees the Location of each Truth, and the respect that it hath to all the rest; not onely to see that there is no contradiction, but how every Truth doth fortifie the rest. All this therefore is exceeding desirable, but it is not every mans lot to attain it, nor any mans in this world perfectly, or near to a perfection: It is true, that the sight of all Gods frame of the Creation, <hi>uno intuitu,</hi> in all its parts, with all their respects to each other, would acquaint us with abundance more of the glory of it, then by looking on the Members peace-meal we can attain: But who can see them thus, but God? at least, what mortal eye can do it? And we shall never in this life at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to see the full Body of Divine Revealed-Truths, in that method and due proportion, as is necessary to the knowledge of its ful<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>What then? because we cannot know all, shall we know nothing, or deny all? Because we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not see the whose frame of the world, in its junctures and proportion, shall we say, That there is no world, or, that the parts are not right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly situated<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Is it ever the more difficult to God, because it is impossible to such as we? Will you say, That a horse can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not carry you on his back, because a flie cannot? Creatures may be compared to Creatures; but between the Creator; and the Creature, there is no comparison. Have you read how God posed <hi>Job</hi> in point of power and knowledge? (<hi>Job</hi> 38. 39, 40, 41.) But who is he that hath posed God? What is that work that should be difficult to him, that by his Word or Will did make all the Worlds? Are they greater works then those which he hath certainly done, that you speak of so incredulously? If you had never seen the Sun, or Moon, or Stars, or Earth, or Sea, and had meerly found it written, that God made such a World, it is like you would as doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly have said, [<hi>How can these things be?</hi>] If you had no more seen the Light or Sun, then you have seen the Angels, or Souls of men its like you would have as little believed, that there is such a thing as Light or a Sun, as you now do, that there are Angels and Immortal Souls. But I hope you are satisfied in the things you see; and may not they shame your incredulity of the things you do not see? You see there is a Sun, and Moon, and Firmament, and Earth; you know these had either a Maker and Cause<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or else were eternal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and as an eternal cause to themselves. If they were eternal, or made themselves, then they are the first Being and Cause, and so are gods.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57536:14"/>
And is it not more reasonable to believe one God, then so many? And to believe that God is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect incomprehensible, superin-tellectual Being, then to believe, that the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

If it were your self, or such as you, that had been the doer of such works, you might well say, [<hi>How can these things be?</hi>] But God is not as man in his Works, or Word.</p>
            <p>6. Yea, many times when men do but hear, read, or think of some Objection against the Truth of Gods revelations, which they cannot tell how to answer themselves, they presently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to stagger at the whole Truth, and question it on every such slight occasion. If any new diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty arise in their way, they are in the case of <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> saying, [<hi>How can these things be?</hi>] Though they have heard never so many Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to confirm them, and have been long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving them, and seen an evidence of Truth in them, yet every new cavil or hard Objection doth seem to enervate all this evidence.</p>

            <p>It is most certain, that all men are very imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in knowledge, and especially in the highest mysteries; and there is none so high as those in Theology, about God, and Mans Soul, and our Redemption, and our Everlasting State.

What if you cannot an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer all that is brought by the Devil and Cavillers, against the Truth? Can you answer all that Christ and his Servants say for it? I dare say you cannot, unless you take every impertinent vanity or falshood for an answer. God needs not you to be the Defenders of his Truth: He is able to vindicate it himself against all the enemies in the World? Otherwise, if he had called you chiefly to this work, he would have furnished you for it. But he first calleth you to be Schollars to learn that truth, that he may help you over all difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in his time and way.</p>
            <p>We are next to shew the Causes of this unhappy distemper; why it is, or whence it comes to pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, that men are so prone to doubt of Gods Truth, upon every difficulty or mysterie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is in their way? And to question all, when they are stalled in any thing; and to deny the very things that are certain, when they are puzzled, and at a loss, but about the Manner, Cause, Reason, or Ends of them. And among others, the Causes of this great Sin, are these following.</p>
            <p>1. Man is naturally desirous of Knowledge, and to see things in their own Evidence And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he is oft an unmannerly impatient suiter to be presently admitted into the presence Chamber of Truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to see her naked without delay. Nature will hardly be satisfied with believing; which is a receiving of Truth upon trust from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, no, though he give us the most convincing
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57536:15"/>
Arguments of his Veracity; no, though it be God himself: Nothing will satisfie Nature, but <hi>se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ing.</hi> I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the wisest men in the World tell them, that they <hi>see</hi> it, or know it; if the workers of miracles, Christ and his Apostles, tell them that <hi>they see it;</hi> if God himself tells them that <hi>he sees it;</hi> yet all this doth not satisfie them, unless they may <hi>see it themselves.</hi> They think this is but to be kept at a distance, without door, and what may be within, they cannot tell: Every man hath an understanding of his own, and therefore would have a sight of the evidence himself; and so have a nee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er knowledge of the thing, and not onely a knowledge of the Truth of the thing by the Testimony of another, how infallible so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. And therefore we are all prone, when dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties seem great, to say with <hi>Thomas, [Except I see, I will not believe.] John</hi> 20. 25. Bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> [<hi>blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.] v.</hi> 29. How far this desire of knowledge is in nature as from. God, and how far it is in Nature, as cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, I will not stand to debate; but that it is in us we feel: And this is a preparative Reason of our doubting and dis-satisfaction, if not a proper cause.</p>
            <p>2. This nature of man is yet so much more desirous to know, that though it do see things in their own proper evidence, yet is it not satisfied, unless it also see the whole, and comprehend all things with all their Reasons, Causes, and Modes. Man affecteth a certain infiniteness in knowledge; he would know all that is know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; and so would be as God in knowing.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57536:16"/>
And if he be ignorant of any part, he rem ineth unsatisfied, and so is ready to quarrel with all; and like froward children that throw away their meat or cloaths, or what else they have, because they cannot have what more they would have. Every little childe will be asking you, not onely <hi>what is this?</hi> or, <hi>what is that?</hi> but also, <hi>why is this so or so?</hi> and, <hi>to what use is it.</hi> And so do men in the matters of God: And if you satisfie them not in all, they will scarce be satisfied in any thing.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Besides this, there is indeed a great dependance of one truth upon another; and they are (in Morality) as a well framed Building, or as a Clock or Watch, or the like Engine, where no one part can be missing without g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t wrong to the whole. Now when these m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n cannot see all, they do indeed want those helps that are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to the perfect seeing of any part; and then they have not the skill of making use of an imperfect knowledge, but are ready to take it for none, till they conceit it full and perfect; and thus are still detained in unbelief, and quarrelling with that which they did, or might know, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of that which they did not, or could not know.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Moreover, it is most certain that when God calls us at first to the knowledge of his truth, he findeth us in darkness; and though he bring us thence into a marvellous light (<hi>Acts</hi> 26. 18. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9.) yet he doth this by degrees, and not into the fullest light or measure of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge at the first; so that we are at the beginning
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57536:16"/>
but Babes in knowledge. It cannot be expected, that a man that was born blinde, with an indispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of understanding to spiritual things, and that hath lived in blindness long<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> should present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know all things, as soon as he is converted: They do not so come to knowledge in earthly things, which they are more disposed to know, and which are nearer to them, much less in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things. The <hi>Disp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sitive</hi> blindness of the best Convert, is cured but in part, much less his <hi>actual</hi> blindness. For (as I have said before) if a man have his eyes never so perfectly opened, who before was blinde, yet he will not see any more then is near him, within sight: If he will see other Countries, places, or persons, he must be at the pains and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tience of travelling to them. And so in this case, when God hath opened the eyes of the blinde, they must yet expect to know, but by degrees: O what abundance of things are yong Converts ignorant of, that are fit to be known? They are but entred into Christs School to learn; and can they think to know all the first day or year: But alas, many that are nominally entered, bring not with them the true disposition of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and therefore quarrel with their Master and his Teaching, in stead of diligent seeking after knowledge. Men have not the patience to stay at School, and wait on Christs teaching till they have got so much knowledge, as might dispel their doubts. They must be taught all at once, though they are uncapable of it, and must know all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently, or in a little time, and with little pains; or else; they will not believe that Christ can teach

them. And so they run away from him, like fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish, impatient Schollars, because he did not bring them to more knowledge, and will not stay the time that their own ignorance doth naturally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, for so great a work.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, And there is also much <hi>Diligence</hi> neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, as well as time and patience, before men ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

If you stay never so long in Christs School, and yet be Truants and Loyterers, and will not take pains; no wonder if you remain ignorant. And yet these men will expect, that they should know all things, and be satisfied in the answer of every Objection, or else they will suspect the Truths of Christ. Will sitting still in Christs School, help you to learning? do you look that he should teach you, when you will not take pains to learn what he teacheth? You know in Law, in Physick, in the knowledge of any of the Sciences or Languages, no man can come to understand them, much less to defend them against all opposers, and to resolve all Objections, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out so long diligence and pains taking in his Studies, as the greatness of the work requires. And shall every yong lazy Student in Theology, or every dull, unlearned Professor, think to see through all Scripture difficulties so easily? or else will he suspect the Truth which he should learn? It may be you have been Professors of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty long; but have you studied the Scriptures day and night, and consulted with men of judgment in such things, and diligently read the writings

that should unfold them to you, and held on in this way, till you came to a ripeness of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, and ability to defend the truth against gain-sayers? If not, what wonder, if every diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty do puzzle you, after all your unprofitable duties and profession.</p>
            <p>6. Moreover, there is a great deal of other knowledge necessary to the through-knowing of the sence of Scriptures. Though the unlearned may know so much as is of absolute necessity to salvation, (and will save, if it be heartily believed and improved;) yet there is much learning neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to the fuller understanding of them, and to the resolving of all doubts and difficulties that may occur. And this is not because Christ hath delighted to speak obscurely; but because our distance and imperfection, and the nature of the thing, doth make such learning to be necessary. For if Christ speak in the Syriack tongue, and if the Scriptures be written in Hebrew and Greek, (which were then fittest to divulge it;) how can it be expected, That Englishmen, Frenchmen, Germans, or any that understand not those Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, should understand them so fully as those that do? For no bare Translation, though never so exact, can give us the full sence of the Original words.

            <p>7. Yea, some men are so far from having all the forement<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>8. Besides this, it is most certain, that when the best men have done all that they can, they will here know but in p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And this imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection joyned with the corruptions, which we shall anon mention<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> doth cause these suspectings of the Truth that should be entertained.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:57536:19"/>9. There are some truths also which are not well understood without exper<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ce: And it is onely Sanctification that giveth that experience. And therefore the unsanctified take them but for fancies and suspect the truth of that Word which doth assert them.</p>
            <p>10. But one of the greatest causes of this sin, is the pride of mens heart, which makes them forget their great ignorance, shallowness, and incapacity: Men have such arrogant under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings, that be they never so empty, they think themselves immediatly capable of receiving any truth that shall be delivered to them. And if they understand not what they read or hear, they never suspect their own wit, but the writer or speaker: Because they a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e at age, and are now past childhood, they think they need no more to make them capable. Little know they the nature of that knowl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dge which they want; and how it must be attained: They know not that there is a certain order<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> among truths; and that one pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposeth another; and all the lower are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>requisite to the higher: They know not how m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ny hundreds of the lower preparatory truths, must be known before some of the higher can be well understood: They would go to the top of the stairs, without going up the lower steps: It would make a sober man wonder to see the impudent Pride and Arrogancy of some igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nt men; that when they have need to sit many a year at the feet of some Teacher, and humbly learn that which they know not, they will as confidently pass a present censure on
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57536:19"/>
the things that they understand not, as if they were as throughly acquainted with them as the best: And if they see not the evidence of a Truth, they will as confidently and scornfully call it an error, as if they were indeed most capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of judging of it: When men of true un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding do see that truth as clear as the light.</p>
            <p>If they hear a confident Seducer, that hath a glozing tongue, and plausible cavils against a truth, these arrogant w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s will presently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that he is in the right, and cannot be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered; as if no body can do it, because they cannot: When, alas, men of understanding may presently discern gross ignorance, and absurdity, in that which sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>llow brains are so confident of. We can scarce meet with the man so grosly ignorant, but he is confident of his own under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, and wise in his own conceit: So that when we may expect that they should say, [<hi>What ignorant foolish wretchet are we, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not understand the Word of God:</hi>] They are ready to accuse or suspect the Word, and say, [<hi>How can these things be?</hi>]</p>
            <p>11. And this Arrogancy is much increased by the very nature of ignorance, which is, to be even ignorant of it self. He that never saw the light knows not what light is, not what dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is as differing from light. A dead man knows not what death is: A bruit knows not what bruitishness is, because he knows not what Reason is.</p>
            <p>There is a good measure of knowledge
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57536:20"/>
necessary to make some men to know their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. What can shew a man his error, but the contrary truth? This is it therefore that hinders mens conviction, and makes them confident in their most false conceits; seeing they want both that Light, and that Humdity which should take down their confidence. We have as much ado to make some men know, that they do not know, as to make them know, that which they know not, when once they will believe that they do not know it: Especially, if men have but any plausi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, natural wit, or a little taste of lea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:57536:21"/>14. Also it is a great occasion of this sin of Infidelity and Arrogancy, and questioning all that men do not understand, that they know not the true nature of the Christian State and Life, and build not in the order that Christ hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed them. Christs method is this, That they should first understand and believe those Essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als of Christianity, without which there is no Salvation; and then engage themselves to learn of him as his Disciples; and so to set themselves to School to him, and live under his teaching, that they may know by degrees, the rest of his will. And his teaching is joyntly by his Word, Ministers, and Spirit. Men must first lay the Foundation in an explicite faith, and hold to those Fundamentals as of in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>allible certainty, and not expect to know the rest in a moment, nor without much diligence and patience, but wait on Christ in the Condition of Disciples, to learn all the rest. All this is expressed in Christs Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to his Apostles, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>0. 21. Where he first bids them disciple the Nations (which contains the convincing them (at age) of the fundamentals, and procuring their consent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then to baptize them, that they may be so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly engaged; and then teach them to observe all things whatsoever<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he commanded them; and this must be the work of all their lives.</p>
            <p>Now here are two gross Errors, contrary to this stablished order of Christ, which Professors do oft run into, to their own perdition. The one is, when they do not first lay the Fundamentals as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ertain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, but hold them loosly, and are ready
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57536:21"/>
on all occasions to reduce them to doubtful and uncertain points; or to question them, though their evidence be never so full, because of some defect of evidence in other points.</p>
            <p>A most foolish and perverse course, which will hinder any man that useth it, from the true un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of any Science in the World. For in all Sciences there are some undoubted Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples which must be first laid, and it must not be expected, that all points else should be of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual necessity or evidence as they: But if we should meet with never so much doubtfulness in any of the superstructure, yet these principles must still be held fast. For he that will be still plu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>king up his Foundation, upon every error in the building, is never like to perfect his work.</p>
            <p>The second common Error, is, That as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors do not lay the Foundation as certain, so they do not unseignedly s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t themselves in the true posture of Disciples or Schollars to learn the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>est, but think themselves past Schollars when they have gone to School, and engaged themselves to Christ, their Teacher. This is the undoing of the greatest part of the visible Church.</p>
            <p>If they come to the Congregation, it is not as Schollars to School, but as Judges to pass sentence of the Doctrine of their Teachers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they understand it: And if they reade the Scripture, it is in the same sort. When they are at a loss, through any occurrent difficulty, they do not go to their Teachers
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57536:22"/>
as humble Schollars, to learn the true sence of the Word, and the solution of their doubts: But they go as confident cen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>15. Lastly, Besides all the former causes of this Sin, some men are judicially deserted, and left to the power of their Arrogancy and Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.

            <p>I have noted many Professors that have lived in pride, flesh-pleasing, or secret filthiness, or unrighteousness, or worldliness, and would not see, nor forsake their sin, but hold on in their profession, and their lusts together; that these are most commonly given over to gross Heresies, or Infidelity: For when they are once captivated

            <p>From what hath been said already in the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">Use.</note> of this point, we may see what a corrupt and froward heart is in man, as to the matters of God, and his own Salvation: Three notable corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are together comprehended in the diste<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So that it is no true Belief, if the credit of the Testifyer be not the reason of your Assent. If therefore you must see the reason of Gods revealed truths, and the very manner and end of all his works, before you will believe, this is as much as openly to proclaim, that you will be no believers at all.

               <p>8. Will you allow your own children or Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars to do so by you? If they should dispute with you instead of believing you, and so should reject all that you tell them as false, that is beyond their capacity as to the reasons and manner; you would not think that they did their duty When a school<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master is teaching his scholars their lesson, shall they instead of learning, dispute it with their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and in every difficulty or seeming contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, unbelievingly say, [<hi>How can these things be</hi>]? Be not guilty of that towards God, which you would not have a child be guilty of to a man.</p>
               <p>9. Consider aso, if this course be taken, whether ever you be like to come to knowledge. For the knowledge of things whose Evidence is all in the Revelation, and the credit of the Testifyer, can be no other way attained but by believing. All things seem strange and difficult at first, to those
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:57536:28"/>
that have not learned them. If you understand all things already, what need you to learn any more? If you do not, then all that you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand will appear to you at first as darkness or contradiction. If now you will be so confident of your own understandings, as to cast away all that you understand not already, because it seems con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory or unlikely, how are you like to know any more? If you will conclude that all is false which you understand not already, you are like to make but unprofitable scholars. Well there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore saith <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 6. 12. [<hi>Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit? there is more hope of a fool then of him</hi>] For certainly it is a double degree of folly, for a man not onely to be ignorant of the things of God, but also to be so ignorant of his own ignorance. And we must be at more pains to make such proud men know that they do not know, then to make the humble to know the truths themselves, which they perceive that they yet know not. And therefore <hi>Paul</hi> doth not only bid us [<hi>Be not wise in your own conceits] Rom.</hi> 12 16 But also, intimates that ignorance is the cause of such conceits of wisdom, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 25. [<hi>For I would not brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits</hi>] As <hi>Solomon</hi> saith of the foolish sluggard, that [<hi>He is wiser in his own conceit then seven men that can render a reason] Pro.</hi> 26 16.</p>
               <p>10. Consider, Whether in this case you joyn not impudency and inhumane ingratitude to your Arrogancy? When Christ condescendeth to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come your teacher, and you are loyterers and

dullards and will not learn, but have lost the most of your time in his schoole, is it not a great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy now, that he will yet entertain you and instruct you, and doth not turn you out of his schoole? And will you, instead of being thankful for this mercy, fall a quarrelling with his truth, and take on you to be wiser then he, when you have so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked him by your ignorance and unprofitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness! Will you flye in his face, with audacious unbelieving questions, and say [<hi>How can these things be.</hi>] As if it were he that knew not what he said, and not you that did not understand him?</p>
               <p>11. Consider, How easily can God evince the verity of those passages which you so confidently reject, and open your eyes to see that as plain as the high-way, which now seems to you so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory or improbable? And then what will you have to say for your unbelief and Arrogancy, but to confess your folly and sit down in shame? You know when any difficult case is propounded to you in any other matter, which you can see no probable way to resolve, yet when another hath resolved it to your hands in a few words, it is presently all plain to you, and you wonder that you could not see it before. You are as one that wearyeth himself with studying to unfold a Riddle, and when he hath given it over as impossible, another openeth it to him in a word. Or as I have seen boys at play with a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

presently and easily opens them before his face. So when you have puzzelled your brains in searching out the reasons of Gods ways, and seeking to reconcile the seeming contradictions of his word, and say [<hi>How can these things be</hi>] in a moment can God shew you how they can be, and make all plain to you, and make you even wonder that you saw it not sooner, and ashamed that you opened your mouth in unbelief. How plain is that to a man of knowledge, which to the ignorant seems impossible? If the certain event did not convince them, you should never perswade the ignorant vulgar, that learned men know so much of the motions of the Planets, and can so long before tell the Eclipse of Sun or Moon, to a Minute. But when they see it come to pass, they are convinced. Thus can God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince thee of the verity of his word, either by a merciful illumination, or by a terrible execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion For there is not a soul in Hell but doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the truth of the threatnings of God. And the Devils themselves Believe, that would draw thee to unbelief.</p>
               <p>12. Lastly, Take heed of the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of this sin; for it is the ordinary way to total Apostasy; when men have once so far lost their humility and modesty, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got that they are men, or what a man is, as to make their shallow Reason the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer of Gods Word, because of certain seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing improbabilities; and when they will not rest satisfyed in the bare Word of God, that

               <p>O therefore let all young, raw students, and unsetled wits take heed in the fear of God, that they exalt not themselves, and that they think not their weak understandings to be capable of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending the counsels of God, and passing a censure upon his word, upon the nature of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as appearing unto them.

               <p>Yea it may be easily and certainly disproved, even by him that cannot reconcile those seeming contradictions: For [<hi>God attesteth no contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: but God attesteth the holy Scripture. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>

               <p>And indeed common reason tells us that we must first have a general proof that Scripture is Gods word, and argue thence to the verity of the parts, &amp; not begin with a particular proof of each part: It seems you would argue thus: [<hi>This and that text of Scripture are true: therefore they are Gods word</hi>] but reason telleth you, you should argue thus [<hi>This is Gods word: therfore it is true</hi>] If you set a boy at school to learn his Grammar, will you allow him to be so foolish, as to stay till he can reconcile every seeming contradiction in it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he believe it to be a Grammar, or submit

cause of his own pravity. God made him not evil, but he made himself so. God gave him free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wil to be a self-determining principle; by this he was enabled to stand or fall, and left in the hands of his own counsel. By a sinful act he averted himself from the chiefest good, and became dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to a further aversion, which might quickly habituate him to all evil. Nor is it any deifying of the Creatures will, to say it is such a self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining principle, and so far a first cause, while it had the power of self-determination from God, and so absolutely is no first cause. It was the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the Creature, as being to be governed, to have freewil, or a self-determining power to good or evil: Though it be a higher perfection to be determined or determinable onely to good, which <hi>in Patriâ</hi> may be enjoyed, yet <hi>in viâ</hi> for one under Government in the use of means in order to the end, it is most suitable to their condition to have a liberty of self-determination: And therefore this was part of the beauty of the frame of Nature, and therefore not derogatory from the workman.
