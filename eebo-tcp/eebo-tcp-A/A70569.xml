            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE <hi>Weeks</hi> of <hi>Daniel</hi> are a Divine
Chronology of the Time which
the Sanctuary, with the Legall
Service, should continue, when
it should be restored after the Captivity of
Babylon. During which time, also the
City of Jerusalem it self should be re-inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited,
and the walls thereof rebuilded; and
some Lxij. weeks after that began to be,
should Messiah the Redeemer be anoynted,
yea, and cut off and rejected of his own: For
which, when the whole Lxx. weeks (the
time allotted) should expire, their Sanctuary
and City should again be razed, and their
Common-wealth utterly dissolved.</p>

                  <q>Seventy weeks are allotted for thy people, and for
thy Holy City, to finish transgression, and make an
end of sinnes, and to make reconciliation for iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

MOST HOLY.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>
                  <hi>SEventy Weeks are determined or allotted:</hi>] That
is, The Holy City shall again be restored,
and Lxx. weeks of yeares are allotted and
limited for the continuance thereof, and thy
people with it: and that for this end, that
during the standing thereof, the Messiah, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to vision and prophecy, may come
to expiate sinne, and be anointed in his
Kingdome.</p>
               <p>The word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> here translated <hi>determined</hi>
or <hi>allotted</hi> signifies properly <hi>to be cut,</hi> or <hi>cut
out,</hi> and so may seeme to imply such a sense,
as if the Angel had said to <hi>Daniel,</hi> Howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
your bondage and Captivity under the
Gentiles shall not altogether cease, untill that
succession of Kingdomes, which I before
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54980:3"/>
shewed thee, be quite finished: yet shall God
for the accomplishing his promise concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Messiah, as it were <hi>cut out</hi> of that
long terme and certain limited Time, during
which, the Captivity of Judah and Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem
being interrupted, the Holy City and
Common-wealth in some measure shall
again be restored, and so continue till Lxx.
Weeks of yeares be finished.</p>
               <p>Here I distinguish the beginning of the
Times of the Holy City from the beginning
of Jerusalem: For the Holy City is so called
of the Temple as the principall part; and
therefore the Time of the restitution thereof,
to be reckoned from the Time the Temple
was builded. But by Jerusalem is understood
(as appeares in the next verse) the externall
buildings and wals of the City, which were
not restored, till some time after the Temple
and Sanctuary was finished.</p>
               <p>As for the impletion, all are now agreed,
That the Beginning of these Weeks is to be
reckoned from some Restoring, either of the
Temple; and that in the second, third, or
sixt yeare of the Raigne of some <hi>Darius;</hi> or of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54980:4"/>
the City in the seventh or twentieth yeare of
some <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> Kings of <hi>Persia.</hi> But it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be from <hi>Darius</hi> the first sirnamed <hi>Hysta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spis;</hi>
for then they would come out long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Birth of Christ. Nor from the first
<hi>Artaxerxes</hi> sirnamed <hi>Longimanus,</hi> for he was
an hinderer of the work of the Temple, and
forbad the building thereof, <hi>Ezra cap. vers. 11.
ad finem.</hi> Nor from the second <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
<hi>Mnemon:</hi> for so they would far over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reach
the Destruction of Jerusalem. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it remaines that they be counted from
<hi>Darius</hi> the second, sirnamed <hi>Nothus;</hi> in the
second yeare of whose raign the work of the
Temple, after a long interruption, began to
revive. <hi>Ezr. 4. v. 24. Hag. c. 1. &amp; 2. Zachar.
c. 1. &amp;c.</hi> and in the sixt yeare of his raign was
finished, <hi>Ezra 6. ver.</hi> 15.</p>
               <p>Secondly, these Lxx. Weeks are the time
allotted for the continuance of the Holy Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and therefore must they last, as long as it
lasted, and end with the end thereof: but
this cannot be, unlesse we fixe their <hi>Epocha</hi> in
the beginning of <hi>Darius Nothus. Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which in the event is most true. For from
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54980:4"/>
the third yeare of <hi>Darius Nothus,</hi> when the
work of the Temple (by the incitement of
<hi>Haggai</hi> and <hi>Zachary</hi> renewed the year before)
was now confirmed by a new Edict from
the King to be finished, unto the Destruction
of Jerusalem by <hi>Titus,</hi> are exactly 490 yeares,
that is, Lxx. Weeks of years fully compleat.</p>

years and an half sooner, namely, when the
last week is but half run out. And what if it
do? The Angel, as I conceive, tels us so much
in the last verse, when he sayes, <hi>That in the

cease, and the City be made desolate.</hi> But how will
the Prophecy be made good, if the <hi>Seventieth</hi>
Week be not compleat? I answer, It should
be observed (though it useth not to be) that
the Angel reckons not by single yeares, but
by Weeks. If he had said, there should be
490. years to the <hi>Excidium</hi> of Jerusalem, then
indeed to make good the prediction, the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54980:6"/>
City and Sanctuary must have been destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the last year. But when he sayes, there shall
be Lxx. Weeks allotted for the continuance
of the Holy City, it is enough if it be made
desolate in the seventieth week: For if those
who reckon by yeares, when the yeare de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
answers the event, will not stand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the compleatnesse of months and dayes;
nor those who reckon any thing by dayes,
upon the compleatnesse of houres and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes:
no more in the Angels reckoning
here by weeks, if so the number of the weeks
be compleat, are the parts of a week to be
exacted.</p>

and lesser period of time comprehended in
them; whose Beginning was to be after the
Lxx. were begun, and the end before they
should be ended. The Root of this second
Computation is described to be a time when
two things should be done: A Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
should go forth both to cause to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
and also to Build, not the Temple (for
that should be done before) nor some few
houses onely, but the whole <hi>Area</hi> or Street
and the Walls of Jerusalem, which should
then be re-edified, though in a strait of
Times; that is, it should be such a time, when
a Commission to cause the people to return
and re-inhabite, should be seconded with
another, to build the Wall of Jerusalem,
and the Plot within the Wall. For by <gap reason="foreign">

that the Church of Israel in the Gospel

no other place of Scripture, whence they did

this of <hi>Daniel.</hi> For there is no other Prophecy
in all the Old Testament besides this, where

Now whether these examples be sufficient
to make probable the Translation which I
have given, I will not affirm; let others judge.
I propound it to the consideration of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
who can do it, without whose appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
I shall not satisfie my self. Yet thus
much I am sure of; that if this <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
which we are wont to translate <hi>seven weeks,</hi>
could be well bestowed, the chiefest difficulty
were taken from this Prophecy. For the
<hi>Threescore and two Weeks</hi> alone counted from
the <hi>Epocha</hi> here named, so well befits the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
from thence to CHRIST, that the
event seemeth to argue, that they should be
there fixed, and not reckoned from any other
Beginning.</p>
               <p>Moreover that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> should be a
generall expression of what in the Lxij.
Weeks is after more particularly determined,
may seem probable for these reasons. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Angel ascribes no proper event unto
them; but having presently named the Lxij.
Weeks, makes no farther reckoning of those
other, but follows and dwels upon these on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as though the other were implied and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:54980:9"/>
in them. 2. Those who count them
for Xlix. years, and continue the Lxij. Weeks
from the end of them to make up Lxix.
Weeks in all, can give no sufficient reason
why they should be thus separated and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
asunder. For that which the followers
of <hi>Funccius,</hi> (who reckon from <hi>Artaxerxes
Longiman.)</hi> assign to be done in seven Weeks
of years (to wit, that during all that time Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem
with the rest of the Cities of Judah
were building and repairing) is grounded
neither upon Scripture, nor other Story, but
pure and meer conjecture. <hi>Scaliger</hi> finds
<hi>(Nehem. cap. 13. 6.)</hi> That <hi>Nehemiah</hi> returned
again to <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> his Court, in the 32. year
of his raign, and thence supposeth that the
building of the City, about which he was
sent, was finished but the year before, and
that to be the determination of those <hi>seven
Weeks;</hi> there being then 49. years expired
from the time the Lxx. began at the Building
of the Temple under <hi>Darius Nothus.</hi> But to
make this good, he is fain to raise the <hi>Epocha</hi>
of the Lxx. so high in the raign of <hi>Darius,</hi> that
they end before the destruction of Jerusalem.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54980:10"/>
Besides, he seems not to be aware, that these
seven Weeks are by the Text to be counted
from a time, when a Commission came out
to cause to return and to build Jerusalem,
and not from the time of building the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
Nor does it follow, <hi>Nehemiah</hi> staid so
long there, therefore the City was till then in
building: Nay, what if the Text rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strued,
imports not that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> in the 32.
year of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> returned to the Court; but
rather that obtaining new leave of the King,
he came then to Jerusalem the second time,
whence he had been long absent? For the

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> would without any ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maly

<hi>[Many Weeks]</hi> if it might seem probable, that
in a passage of reckoning by definite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
some numerall word may be taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely.
The sense would be all one with
that I have followed. <hi>viz.</hi> As the whole time
limited for the continuance of the Holy City
consisted of many Weeks, even Lxx. Weeks:
So also this lesser period contained therein,
from the <hi>Epocha</hi> mentioned unto MESSI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>AH,
shall be a time of Many Weeks, even
Lxij. Weeks. Another way, were it not
somewhat harsh, might be this. The He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew

                  </gap>, as by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonants

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:54980:11"/>
same <hi>Epocha</hi> with them under <hi>Artaxerxes Mne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
then from the end of them, and yet leave
as probable a conjecture to be made of what
was done in them, as those who follow <hi>Func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi>
from the other <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> do use to
give.</p>
               <p>I have sometimes considered, whether, if
it be translated <hi>seven Weeks,</hi> those <hi>seven Weeks</hi>
might not be applyed as <hi>rotundus numerus</hi> to
those <hi>Fifty and two dayes, Nehem.</hi> 6. 15. where it
is said, <hi>
                     <q>So the Wall was finished in the 25. day
of the Moneth Elul in fifty two dayes;</q>
                  </hi> somewhat
more indeed then <hi>seven Weeks,</hi> yet short of <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
&amp; an half,</hi> and so not regarded in accompt
by <hi>Weeks.</hi> If this could be, then the reason of
the Angels division of weeks into 7. and 62.
would be because of divers kinds of Weeks
understood; the first of dayes, wherein the
Wall of Jerusalem should be finished: the
second of years, from thence unto the Messi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah.
If it seem impossible or unlikely that
the Wall of the City should be repaired in so
short a time, and therefore those words, (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>Iunius)</hi> to be meant of setting up
the doors and bars only: I could say first, that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54980:12"/>
the Wall was not new builded from the
foundations, but repaired upon the old ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines.
Secondly, the speedy dispatch thereof
was taken for a wonder, even by the Jews
Enemies, who thereupon (saith the Text)
<hi>
                     <q>perceived it was the hand of their God:</q>
                  </hi> So that,

<hi>Diodor. Sic. lib.</hi> 11. Yea, to come more near
to the thing in question, <hi>Iosephus lib. 6. c. 13.
De Bell. Iud.</hi> tells us, That <hi>Titus,</hi> dividing
the work amongst his Army, begirt <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>
in three dayes space, with a Wall of
thirty nine Furlongs, and thirteen Bulwarks
to hinder the Jews excursions from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
and all relief from without. What the
materials were, I know not, but he sayes
it was a thing beyond all belief, and might
have seemed to be a work of some
Moneths. But leaving this digression, let
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:54980:12"/>
us see the computation and impletion of our
Lxij. Weeks.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>The Computation and impletion of the

                  <p>FRom the seventh yeare of <hi>Artaxerxes
Mnemon,</hi> when <hi>Ezra</hi> had Commission
<hi>to cause to Return</hi> and carry with him, as
many of the Jews as would to Jerusalem,
<hi>Ezra c. 7. ver. 7. &amp;</hi> 13. And from the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth
year of the same <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> when
<hi>Nehemiah</hi> obtained leave to build Jerusalem
the City of his Fathers Sepulchres, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 2.
From both these Commissions, though
thirteen years distant the one from the other,
are by divine disposition unto MESSIAH
the PRINCE <hi>threescore and two Weeks,</hi>
from the first of <hi>Solar,</hi> from the latter, of
<hi>Lunar</hi> years. For Lxij. weeks, or 434. <hi>Lunar</hi>
years, are lesse then so many <hi>Solar,</hi> as much
as is between the seventh, and twentieth of
<hi>Artaxerxes:</hi> which admirable concordance
I cannot impute to chance; but ascribe to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:54980:13"/>
divine providence, so ordering it of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
that these two <hi>Epocha's</hi> and Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<hi>To cause to Return,</hi> and, <hi>To build Ierusalem,</hi>
might be as one and the same. And as the
<hi>Lunar</hi> year is contained within the <hi>Solar,</hi> and
by it ordered and directed; so is the Period
here from <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> Commission to Build
the City, contained and reduced to that
from <hi>Ezraes</hi> Commission to cause the people
to return.</p>
                  <p>In the last of these Weeks according
to prediction was Christ our Lord anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
In the beginning whereof exactly,
between the first and second Passeover af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his Baptisme, (when his Harbinger <hi>Iohn</hi>
had now finished his Message, and was
cast in Prison (a time precisely and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely
noted in the Evangelicall Story) he
first began to preach in <hi>Galilee</hi> the Gospel
of the Kingdome, ordained his Apostles,
and proclaimed himselfe to be the MES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIAH.
<q>
                        <hi>After Iohn was put in Prison,</hi> saith
<hi>Mark 1. 14. Iesus come into Galilee, preaching
the Gospel of the Kingdome of God,</hi> and <hi>saying,</hi>
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>The time is fulfilled,</hi> (i. the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:54980:13"/>
last week of the sixty two weeks is come)
<hi>and the Kingdome of God is at hand.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Wherefore I would take that <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the 13. <hi>ver.</hi> to the 21. to be the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists owne words in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposed, and not the words of Christ to <hi>Nicodemus.</hi>
                        </note> From
that time (saith <hi>Matthew, c.</hi> 4. 17.) Jesus began
to preach, and to say, <hi>Repent, for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of heaven is at hand.</hi>
                     </q> This was that day
whereof Christ himself said at <hi>Nazareth,
that that Scripture was fulfilled: The Spirit of
the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed
me to preach the Gospel to the poore, &amp;c. and
to preach the acceptable yeare of the Lord,
Luke</hi> 4. This the time and place whence
S. <hi>Peter</hi> reckoned the beginning of Christs
Prophecy in his Sermon to <hi>Cornelius: That
word</hi> (saith he) <hi>which was published throughout
all Iudea, and began from Galilee after the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme
which Iohn preached, &amp;c.</hi> Acts 10. 37.</p>
                  <p>In the third year of this Week (two years
and an half after he began his Prophecy, and
three years and an half after his Baptisme)
being made our Priest, he offered himself
upon the Crosse a Sacrifice for sinne, was
dead, buried, and rose again: Then as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
up into heaven to be installed, and
to sit at the right hand of God from
thenceforth to raigne untill he hath put all
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:54980:14"/>
his Enemies under his feet. But you will
say, This was all performed four years
before the 434. years (which is sixty two
Weeks of years) were expired: I answer as
before: The Angell reckons not by single
yeares, but by Weeks, the last whereof
should be Messiahs Week, as we have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it to have been. If the Angel had said,
There shall be 434. years unto MESSIAH,
then to make good the prediction MES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIAH
must have been anointed the last
yeare. But when he sayes, There shall be
Sixty two Weeks unto MESSIAH;
it is sufficient he was anointed the last
Week. But how this Week will at length
be compleat, we shall see in the next verse.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, (which hath no other near it) it
both much clears the sense, and retains its
propriety of signification. Nor is the Postpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of the Nominative case to the verb
against the use of the tongue; nor the traje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
here so great, but the Latin will admit
the same order of the words, <hi>viz. Et abolebit

Howsoever the Translation be, this week
the Angel now speaks of, is the last of the
Seventy which should be but half run out,
when the Temple and City should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed,
and the legall service made to cease.
For if we reckon (as I think we should) the
Seventy Weeks from the sixt year of <hi>Darius
Nothus</hi> (when the Temple was finished) the
Destruction thereof by <hi>Titus</hi> will fall out (as
is shewed) in the midst of the last Week, the
whole half thereof, from the beginning till
then, having bin spent in warlike preparations
and exploits, which ended with the burning
and desolation both of City and Sanctuary.</p>
               <p>Of those who end the Seventieth Week
compleatly with the Destruction of Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,
some seem so to understand this first
part of the verse, as if the <hi>one Week</hi> here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
were the last of the Seventy, and the
confirmation of the Covenant to be therein,
to respect only the first half thereof, wherein
Christ made good his Covenant of preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
to the beleeving Jews, namely, (as I
would explain it) by sending <hi>Cestius Gallus</hi>
President of <hi>Syria,</hi> in the middle or fourth
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:54980:21"/>
year of the last Week, about seven dayes to
environ Jerusalem with an Army, for to be
that sign and watch-word mentioned in the
Gospel of the near approaching Desolation
thereof, <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 20. that so those which were
in <hi>Iudea</hi> being warned, might flee into the
Mountains (of <hi>Arabia Petraea</hi> to <hi>Pella)</hi> and
deliver themselves from those dayes of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
and wrath upon their people. And
in the other half of the Week which remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
he should cause the sacrifice and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to cease by sending <hi>Vespasian</hi> with that
second and fatall Army which should bring
those wofull and vengefull Desolations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them.</p>
               <p>As for the phrase of Confirming a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
(if the rest suted well) it would be no
straining to interpret it, to be meant of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
and exemption from a common
calamity: For we have the like speech <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.
17, 18. where God having said to <hi>Noah,</hi> that
he would destroy by the Flood every thing
<hi>that breathed upon the earth;</hi> addeth, <hi>But with
thee will I establish my Covenant, and thou shalt come
into the Ark, thou and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:54980:21"/>
sons wives with thee, &amp;c.</hi> Thus much of the
Week and Half Week: But for the Desola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
who should cause the sacrifice and obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to cease, whether and how it may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to Messiah himselfe, or otherwise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strued,
we shall better understand when the

<hi>Mat. 24. Mark</hi> 13. where he so expresly referres

intimate that neither the Lxx. before, nor the

S. <hi>Luke</hi> relates not here (as <hi>Matth.</hi> and
<hi>Mark</hi> do) our Saviours words <hi>verbatim,</hi> but
exegetically; of set purpose (so I am perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded)
expounding this place of <hi>Daniel,</hi> as

                  </gap>, (but once
found in the Hebrew Scripture) which sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies

<hi>To gather together:</hi> besides, in the Arabick, <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundare,</hi>
to environ or compasse about; Both
significations sute well to an Army, and the
latter, that which beleaguers and begirts a
City or Fort besieged. Had S. <hi>Luke</hi> any refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to this, when he speaks of Jerusalem
<hi>compassed with an army?</hi> The metaphor also
of a Wing leanes most this way, whether we
consider their figure and motion being
stretched out, or their posture when Birds
of rapine sit couring over their prey. I will
not say, the Romane Eagle was here aimed
at, though <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<hi>Wing,</hi> but for <hi>Alatum &amp; Volatile,</hi> a Fowle or
Winged Creature. It is sufficient that neither
the nature nor name of a Wing is strange or
unaccustomed to an Army. But how (will
you say) will an Army of Abominations be
made an Army of Gentiles? I answer,
The Scripture in many places calleth
Idols by the name of Abominations, that
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:54980:23"/>
is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: So the Egyptian Idols,
<hi>Exod. 8. ver. 26, &amp;c.</hi> are called, The Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

of the Lord. So 2 <hi>Kings 23. Ashtaroth</hi> is called

               <p>This being a thing manifest, we are to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
further, That the Scripture useth also
to expresse and imply under the names of
the Gods, the Nations themselves which
worshipped them. The Lord threatned to
<hi>
                     <q>scatter Israel among the Nations, and that there
they should serve other Gods day and night, Gods,
the works of mens hands, wood and stone, and
which neither they nor their Fathers had known:</q>
                  </hi>
That is, they should serve them not <hi>religiously,</hi>
but <hi>politically,</hi> in as much as they were to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<hi>Slaves</hi> and <hi>Vassals</hi> to Idolatrous Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:54980:23"/>
even such Idolaters, as neither they nor
their Fathers had ever heard of. Let it also be
considered whether that of <hi>David, 1 Sam.</hi> 26. 19.
be not to be expounded after the same Trope:
<q>
                     <hi>They have</hi> (saith he) <hi>driven me out this day from
abiding in the inheritance of the Lord, saying, Goe
serve other Gods;</hi>
                  </q> 
                  <hi>i.</hi> they have driven me to serve
a Nation of another Religion. Yea, <hi>Ezra</hi> 9. 14.

is, Gentiles. And where we reade in the first
verse, <q>
                     <hi>The people of Israel, &amp;c. have not separated
themselves from the people of the Lands according
to their Abominations, &amp;c.</hi> It is the same phrase
with that of <hi>Moses, Cattell after their kinde,
creeping things after their kinde:</hi>
                  </q> That is, the
severall kinds of cattell &amp; of creeping things:
so the people of the Lands according to their
Abominations is, the severall kinds of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters
of the Lands about them. And thus we
have shewed, that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the Wing of

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:54980:24"/>
an Armie of people of Abominations,
That is, of Gentiles and Worshippers of
Idols.</p>
               <p>But who is this Desolater, or Maker of
Desolations, who should command over
this Wing of Abominations, and bring these
Gentiles against the Holy City? ℟ The
words in the Originall stand indifferent to be
applied either to the Romane Generall, or
Messiah; but I could not render them so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently:
For if I render them, <hi>And in half
a Week a Desolater shall cause the sacrifice and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to cease, and that</hi> (being) <hi>over a Wing of Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations,</hi>
Or, <hi>Over a Wing of Abominations</hi> (shall
he be) <hi>who makes desolation;</hi> This Desolater
would then seem to be some other then Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah,
that is the Romane Generall: But ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them as I doe, <hi>And making desolation, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Desolater, He shall cause the sacrifice and
offering to cease, and that, &amp;c.</hi> Or, <hi>He shall cause
the sacrifice and offering to cease, and [commanding]
over a Wing of Abominations, be a Desolater:</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way of these, they will have reference to
MESSIAH the Prince, who is the Person
meant in the words immediately before, <hi>[He
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:54980:24"/>
shall confirm a Covenant with many one Week.]</hi>
And this I most incline to, that so the Person
spoken of may be the same throughout, and
a reason also appear of that additament, That
this Desolater should be over an Army of
Abominations: For if a Forein Generall
were onely meant, what needed this Additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
what other Army could such a one lead,
but Gentiles? But that Messiah himselfe
should command over an Army of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters,
this needed a speciall intimation.</p>
               <p>And surely the Romane Army, though
an Army of Abominations, was in this ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
the Army of Messiah: So the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
aiming at this Prophecy tels us <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 7.
When the King heard how spitefully they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
his Messengers who came to tell
them, the Wedding whereunto they had
been bidden, was ready: <q>
                     <hi>He was wroth</hi> (saith
the Text) <hi>and sent forth HIS Armies and destroyed
those Murtherers,</hi>
                  </q> 
                  <hi>and burnt up their City.</hi> Whence
it is, that the comming of this desolating
Army of the Romans is called the comming
of Christ, <hi>Iames 5.</hi> 
                  <q>
                     <hi>Weep and howl ye rich men</hi>
(he writeth to Jews) <hi>for the miseries that shall

come upon you; for you have heaped up goods for
the last dayes;</hi>
                  </q> That is, (according to <hi>Oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menius)</hi>
when the end of your State is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
and the Romanes shall spoil you of all:
which is expressed in the eighth verse by
Christs comming; <q>
                     <hi>Be ye patient</hi> (saith he)
<hi>untill the comming of the Lord,</hi>
                  </q> (he speaks to
the beleeving Jews whom the rest persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted)
and in the next, <hi>
                     <q>Stablish your hearts for
the comming of the Lord draweth nigh;</q>
                  </hi> He mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth

So he takes
that of <hi>Iohn,</hi> 
                  <q>
                     <hi>If I will that he stay till<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I come,</hi>
                  </q>
that is (saith he) <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, till
the Destruction of Jerusalem. And proves
that this comming of Christ is <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>,
<hi>Excidium Hierosolymorum,</hi> by that of

                  <q>
                     <hi>Behold, the Lord shall come, and
who shall abide the day of his comming?</hi>
                  </q> And
thus would I understand that <hi>Heb. 10. 37. For
<q>yet a little while and He that shall come will come,</q>
and will not tarry.</hi> Messiah therefore himself
seems to be that Desolater here meant, who
should command over an Army of Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations,
when he came to destroy
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:54980:25"/>
the City and the Sanctuary.</p>
               <p>Thus it appears our Saviours citation in
the Gospel is not of the very words of <hi>Daniel</hi>
in this passage, but of the sense onely summa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
expressed; and that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

or <hi>Abominable Army,</hi> over which he
should be, who should <hi>make desolation.</hi> As
for the Seventy, or whosoever else (for
S. <hi>Hierome</hi> doubts) translated this Book, if
their Translation here were originally as we
now have it, and not translated thither out of
our Saviours words in the Gospel, they seem
to have accommodated the place, though
of unlike construction and circumstance of
sense, unto two other places, <hi>Chap. 11. 31.
Chap.</hi> 12. 11. where some such kinde of Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination

                  <p>ALthough I think, that precisenesse of

                  <p>For <hi>Anno Iudaico 3344. Aerae mundi Scaligeria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae</hi>
3533. (the year the Temple was finished)
<hi>Neomenia Tisri,</hi> according to the Jews Calen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,

the 8. of <hi>August,</hi> (whereon the Temple was

a day or two too much. But it is more then
probable that the Jewish Calender was not
in <hi>Darius</hi> his time so exact, nor the Moons
motion so well known, but the New Moon
might sometimes anticipate the beginning of
their Months a day or two.</p>

shew their compleat Seventy Weeks so exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

                  <p>
                     <hi>FVncius</hi> his computation of the Lxx. weeks
from the seventh of <hi>Artaxerxes Longima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
(whence to Christs Passion he finds just
490. years) hath three great and unavoidable
inconveniencies.</p>
                  <p>1. That it ends the 70. Weeks (which by the
text were allotted for the Holy City) long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the times of the holy City were fulfilled.</p>
                  <p>2. That this <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> might not be <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes</hi>
the Hinderer of the Building of the
Temple, but that second <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> that gave
Commission to <hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> they are
fain to bestow the names of <hi>Ahasuerus</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes</hi>
mentioned <hi>Ezra</hi> 4. upon <hi>Cambyses</hi> and
the counterfeit <hi>Tanioxarces</hi> or <hi>Smerdis</hi> (whom
others call <hi>Sphendates)</hi> the <hi>Magus,</hi> without any
ground in Scripture or prophane History;
nay, against probability. For if <hi>Ahasuerus</hi> be
<hi>Cambyses</hi> (as by order he should be) and <hi>Artax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erxes</hi>
be <hi>Smerdis</hi> the <hi>Magus,</hi> how will that busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in the daies of <hi>Artaxerxes, Ezra</hi> 4. 7. befit
the 7. Months raign of <hi>Smerdis?</hi> Or if prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterously
(as some will have it) <hi>Ahasuerus</hi> be
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:54980:28"/>
that <hi>Smerdis,</hi> what needed the Holy Ghost so
precisely to mention the Beginning<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> Ezra 4. 6.</note> of his
raign, if he raigned but seven Months in all?
Secondly, Neither <hi>Cambyses</hi> nor <hi>Smerdis</hi> can be
<hi>Ahasuerus:</hi> For <hi>Ahasuerus, Esther</hi> 3. 7. (and why
should we feign any other <hi>Ahasuerus</hi> of <hi>Persia</hi>
then the Scripture describeth, and so diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
distinguishes from <hi>Ahasuerus</hi> the <hi>Mede,</hi> as if
there had been then no other? <hi>Esth. 1. 1.)</hi> raigned
at least twelve years, whereas <hi>Cambyses</hi> raigned
but seven years, and <hi>Smerdis</hi> but so many
months.</p>
                  <p>3. They cannot shew how 69. Weeks, or
62. Weeks added to 7. Weeks, (for they have
no other way) are determined upon Messiah
the Prince; since they out-reach his Nativity,
and end 7. years before his Passion (which
was in the 19.) and therefore 3. years at least
before <hi>Iohns</hi> Baptisme, which was in the 15. of
<hi>Tiberius.</hi> Wherefore neither beginning nor
ending, neither part nor whole of the sixtieth
and ninth Week can point us out any time of
the manifestation of Messiah.</p>
