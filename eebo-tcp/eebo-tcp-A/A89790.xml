         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>COnfeſſion</hi> of the <hi>Faith</hi> that is in us, when juſtly called for, is ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſable a due all owe to the Glery of the Soveraign GOD, that it is ranked among the Duties of the firſt Commandment, ſuch as Prayer is; and therefore by <hi>Paul</hi> yoaked with Faith it ſelf, as neceſſary to ſalvation: <hi>With the heart man believeth unto righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and with the mouth confeſſion is made unto ſalvation.</hi> Our Lord Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, when he was accuſed of his Doctrine, conſidered ſimply as a matter of fact by Preaching<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> refuſed to anſwer; becauſe, as ſuch, it lay upon evidence, &amp; mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of teſtimony of others; unto whom therefore he refers himſelf: But when both the High-Prieſt and <hi>Pilate</hi> expoſtulate his Faith, and what he held himſelf to be; he without any demur at all, chearfully makes Declarat on, That he <hi>was the Son of GOD;</hi> ſo to the High-Prieſt: And that he was a <hi>King,</hi> and <hi>born to be a King;</hi> thus to <hi>Pilate.</hi> Though upon the uttering of it his life lay at the ſtake: Which boly Profeſſion of his is celebrated for our example, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 13.</p>
            <p>Confeſſions, when made by a company of Profeſſors of Chriſtianity joyntly meeting to that end, the moſt genuine and natural uſe of ſuch Confeſſions is, That under the ſame form of words, they expreſs the ſubſtance of the ſame <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſalvation</hi> or <hi>unity of their faith;</hi> whereby <hi>ſpeaking the ſame things, they ſhew themſelves perfectly joyned in the ſame mind, and in the ſame judgment,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 10.</p>
            <p>And accordingly ſuch a tranſaction is to be looked upon but as a meet or fit <hi>medium</hi> or <hi>means</hi> whereby to expreſs <hi>that</hi> their <hi>common faith and ſalvation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and no way to be made uſe of as an <hi>impoſition</hi> upon any: What ever is of force or conſtraint in matters of this nature, cauſeth them to degenerate from the <hi>name</hi> and <hi>nature</hi> of <hi>Confeſſions,</hi> and turns them from being <hi>Confeſſions of Faith,</hi> into <hi>Exactions</hi> and <hi>Impoſitions of Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſuch <hi>common Confeſſions</hi> of the Orthodox Faith, made in ſimplicity of heart by any ſuch Body of Chriſtians, with concord among themſelves, ought to be entertained by all others that <hi>love the truth as it is in Jeſus,</hi> with an anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>rejoycing:</hi> For if the unanimous opinions and aſſertions but in ſome few points of Religion, and that when by two Churches, namely, that of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the <hi>Meſſengers of Antioch</hi> met, aſſiſted by ſome of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> were by the

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:115309:4"/>
Now that after this firſt guſt thoſe who have bin thus converted ſhould be put upon a new probation and ſearch out of the Scriptures, not onely of all prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples <note place="margin">This per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion cometh not of him that calleth you <hi>Gal. 5. 8.</hi>
               </note>explicitely ingredients to Converſion; (unto which the Apoſtle referreth the <hi>Galatians</hi> when they had diverted from them) but of all other ſuperſtructures as well as fundamentals; and together therewith, anew to experiment the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and ſweetneſs of all theſe in their own ſouls: What is this but <hi>tryed Faith</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed? and equivalent to a new converſion unto the truth? <hi>An Anchor</hi> that is proved to be <hi>ſure</hi> and <hi>ſtedfaſt,</hi> that will certainly hold in all contrary ſtorms. This was the eminent ſeal and commendation which thoſe holy Apoſtles that lived and wrote laſt <hi>(Peter, John,</hi> and <hi>Jude</hi> in their Epiſtles) did ſet and give to the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of the latter part of thoſe <hi>primitive times.</hi> And beſides, it is clear and evident by all the other Epiſtles, from firſt to laſt, that it coſt the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles as much, and far more care and pains to preſerve them they had convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>in the truth,</hi> then they had taken to turn them thereunto at firſt: And it <note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5.</note>is in it ſelf as great a work and inſtance of the power of God, that <hi>keeps,</hi> yea, <hi>guards us through faith unto ſalvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, let this be added, (or ſuperadded rather) to give full weight and meaſure, even to running over, that we have all along this ſeaſon, held forth (though quarrelled with for it by our brethren) this great principle of theſe times, <hi>That amongſt all Chriſtian States and Churches, there ought to be vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed a forbearance and mutual indulgence unto Saints of all perſwaſions, that keep unto, and hold faſt the neceſsary foundations of faith and holineſs,</hi> in all other matters <hi>extrafundamental,</hi> whether of Faith or Order.</p>
            <p>This to have been our conſtant principle, we are not aſhamed to confeſs to the whole Chriſtian world. Wherein yet we deſire we may be underſtood, not as if in the <hi>abſtract</hi> we ſtood indifferent to falſhood or truth, or were careleſs whether faith or error, in any Truths but fundamental, did obtain or not, ſo we had our liberty in our petty and ſmaller differences; or as if to make ſure of that, we had cut out this wide cloake for it: No, we profeſs that the whole, and every particle of that Faith delivered to the Saints, (the ſubſtance of which we have according to our light here profeſſed) is, as to the propagation and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance of it by <hi>all Goſpel-means,</hi> as precious to us as our lives; or what can be ſuppoſed dear to us; and in our ſphere we have endeavored to promote them accordingly: But yet withall, we have and do contend, (and if we had all the power which any, or all of our brethren of differing opinions have deſired to have over us, or others, we ſhould freely grant it unto them all) we have and do contend for this, That <hi>in the concrete,</hi> the perſons of all ſuch gracious Saints, they and their errors, as they are in them, when they are but ſuch errors as do and may ſtand with communion with Chriſt, though they ſhould not repent of them, as not being convinced of them to the end of their days; that thoſe, with their errors (that are purely ſpiritual, and intrench and overthrow not ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil ſocieties,) as <hi>concrete with their perſons,</hi> ſhould for Chriſts ſake be born with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all by all Chriſtians in the world; and they notwithſtanding be permitted to enjoy all Ordinances and ſpiritual Priviledges according to their light, as freely as any other of their brethren that pretend to the greateſt Orthodoxity; as having as equal, and as fair a right in and unto Chriſt, and all the holy things of Chriſt, that any other can challenge to themſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:115309:4"/>
And this doth afford a full and invincible teſtimony on our behalf, in that whiles we have ſo earneſtly contended for this juſt liberty of Saints in all the Churches of Chriſt, <hi>we our ſelves have no need of it:</hi> that is, as to the <hi>matter</hi> of the profeſſion of <hi>Faith</hi> which we have maintained together with others: and of this, this ſubſequent Confeſſion of Faith gives ſufficient evidence. So as we have the confidence in Chriſt, to utter in the words of thoſe two great Apoſtles, That <hi>we have ſtood faſt in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free</hi> (in the behalf of others, rather then our ſelves) and having been <hi>free, have not made</hi> uſe of our <hi>liberty</hi> for <hi>a cloak of error or maliciouſneſs</hi> in our ſelves. And yet, loe, whereas from the beginning of the rearing of theſe Churches, that of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle hath been (by ſome) prophecyed of us, and applyed to us, <hi>That whiles we promiſed</hi> (unto others) <hi>liberty, we our ſelves would become ſervants of corruption, and be brought in bondage</hi> to all ſorts of fancies and imaginations; yet the whole world may now ſee after the experience of many years ran-through (and it is manifeſt by this Confeſſion) that the great and gracious God hath not only kept us in that common unity of the Faith and Knowledge of the Son of God, which the who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Theſe <hi>two conſiderations</hi> have been taken from <hi>the ſeaſons</hi> we have gone through.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, let the <hi>ſpace of time it ſelf,</hi> or dayes, wherein from firſt to laſt the whole of this Confeſſion was framed and conſented to by the whole of us, be du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidered by ſober and ingenuous ſpirits: the whole of days in which we had meetings about it, (ſet aſide the two Lords days and the firſt days meeting, in which we conſidered and debated what to pitch upon) were but 11 dayes, part of which alſo was ſpent by ſome of us in Prayer, others in conſulting; and in the end all agreeing. We mention this ſmall circumſtance but to this end, (which ſtill adds unto the former) That it gives demonſtration, not of our free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and willingneſs onely, but of our readineſs and preparedneſs unto ſo great a work; which otherwiſe, and in other Aſſemblies, hath ordinarily taken up long and great debates, as in ſuch a variety of matters of ſuch concernment, may well be ſuppoſed to fall out. And this is no other then what the Apoſtle <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 15. 2 Cor. 8.</note>exhorts unto, <hi>Be ready always to give an anſwer to every man that asketh you a reaſon, or account of the hope that is in you.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Truths of the Goſpel, <hi>That God hath prepared them for thoſe that love him.</hi> The inward and innate conſtitution of the new Creature being in it ſelf ſuch as is ſuted to all thoſe Truths, as congenial thereunto: But although there be this mutual <hi>adaptneſs</hi> between theſe two, yet ſuch is the mixture of ignorance, dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and unbelief, carnal reaſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pre-occupation of judgment, intereſt of parties, wantonneſs in opinion, proud adhering to our own perſwaſions, and perverſe op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions and av<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rſneſs to agree with others, and a multitude of ſuch like di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers <hi>common to believing man:</hi> All which are not onely mixed with, but at times (eſpecially in ſuch times as have paſſed over our heads) are ready to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloud our judgments, and to cauſe our eyes to be double, and ſometimes prevail
<pb facs="tcp:115309:5"/>
as well as luſts, and do byaſs our wills and affections: And ſuch is their mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that although there may be exiſtent an habitual preparedneſs in mens ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, yet not always a preſent readineſs to be found, ſpecially not in ſuch a vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous multitude of men, to make a ſolemn and deliberate profeſſion of all truths, it being as great a work to find the ſpirits of the juſt (perhaps the beſt of Saints) ready for every truth, as <hi>to be prepared to every good work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is therefore to be looked at, as a great and ſpecial work of the holy Ghoſt, that ſo numerous a company of Miniſters, and other principal brethren, ſhould ſo <hi>readily, ſpeedily,</hi> and <hi>joyntly</hi> give up themſelves unto ſuch a whole Body of <hi>Truths that are after godlineſs.</hi>

            <p>This accord of ours hath fallen out without having <hi>held any correſpondency to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,</hi> or prepared conſultation, by which we might come to be adviſed of one anothers mindes. We alledge not this as a matter of commendation in us; no, we acknowledge it to have been a great neglect: And accordingly one of the firſt propoſals for union amongſt us was, That there might be a conſtant correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence held among the Churches for counſel and mutual edification, ſo for time to come to prevent the like omiſſion.</p>
            <p>We confeſs that from the firſt, every, or at leaſt the generality of our Churches, have been in a manner like ſo many Ships (though holding forth the ſame general colours) lancht ſingly, and ſailing apart and alone in the vaſt Ocean of theſe tumultuating times, and they expoſed to every wind of Doctrine, under no other conduct then the Word and Spirit, and their particular Elders and principal Brethren, without Aſſociations among our ſelves, or ſo much as holding out common lights to others, whereby to know where we were.</p>
            <p>But yet whileſt we thus confeſs to our own ſhame this neglect, let all acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that God hath ordered it for his high and greater glory, in that his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular care and power ſhould have ſo warcht over each of theſe, as that all ſhould be found to have ſteered their courſe by the ſame Chart, and to have been bound for one and the ſame Port, and that upon this general ſearch now
<pb facs="tcp:115309:5"/>
made, that the ſame holy and bleſſed Truths of all ſorts, which are currant and warrantable amongſt all the other Churches of Chriſt in the world, ſhould be found to be our Lading.</p>
            <p>The whole, and every of theſe things when put together, do cauſe us (whatever men of prejudiced and oppoſite ſpirits may find out to ſlight them) with a holy admiration, to ſay, That this is no other then the Lords doing; and which we with thanſgiving do take from his hand as a ſpeciall token upon us for good, and doth ſhew that God is faithfull and upright towards thoſe that are planted in his houſe: And that as the Faith was but once for all, and intentionally firſt delivered unto the Saints; ſo the Saints, when not abiding ſcattered, but gathered under their reſpective Paſtors according to Gods heart into an houſe, and Churches unto the living God, ſuch together are, as <hi>Paul</hi> foreſpake it, the moſt ſteady and firm <hi>pillar</hi> and <hi>ſeat of Truth</hi> that God hath any where appointed to himſelf on earth, where his truth is beſt conſerved, and publiquely held forth; there being in ſuch Aſſemblies weekly a rich dwelling of the Word amongſt them, that is, a daily open houſe kept by the means of thoſe good Houſholders, their Teachers and other Inſtructers reſpectively appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated to them, whom Chriſt in the vertue of his Aſcenſion, continues to give as gifts to his people, himſelf dwelling amongſt them; to the end that by this, as the moſt ſure ſtanding permanent means, the Saints might be perfected<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> till we all (even all the Saints in preſent and future ages) do come by this conſtant and daily Ordinance of his unto <hi>the unity of the Faith and Knowledge of the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 12.</note>
               <hi>Son of God unto a perfect man, unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſſe of Chriſt</hi> (which though growing on by parts and piecemeal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will yet appear com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, when <hi>that great and general Aſsembly</hi>
               <note place="margin">14.</note> ſhall be gathered, then when this  world is ended, and theſe diſpenſations have had their fulneſs and period) and <hi>ſo that from henceforth</hi> (ſuch a proviſion being made for us) <hi>we be no more children toſsed too and fro, and carried about with every wind of Doctrine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And finally, this doth give a freſh and recent demonſtration, that the <hi>great Apoſtle</hi> and <hi>High-prieſt of our profeſsion</hi> is indeed <hi>aſcended</hi> into heaven, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues there with power and care, <hi>faithfull as a ſon over his own houſe, whoſe houſe are we, if we hold faſt the confidence and the rejoycing of the hope firm unto the end:</hi> and ſhews that he will, as he hath promiſed, be with his own Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the end of the world.</p>
            <p>It is true, that many ſad miſcarriages, diviſions, breaches, fallings off from holy Ordinances of God, have along this time of tentation, (eſpecially in the <note place="margin">Heb. 3. 6.</note>beginning of it) been found in ſome of our Churches; and no wonder, if what hath been ſaid be fully conſidered: Many reaſons might further be given here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that would be a ſufficient Apology, without the help of a retortion upon other Churches (that promiſed themſelves peace) how that more deſtroying ruptures have befallen them, and that in a wider ſphere and compaſſe; which though it ſhould not juſtifie us, yet may ſerve to ſtop others mouths.</p>
            <p>Let <hi>Rome</hi> glory of the peace in, and <hi>obedience</hi> of her Children, againſt the Reformed <hi>Churches</hi> for their diviſions that occurred (eſpecially in the firſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of them) whileſt we all know the cauſes of their dull &amp; ſtupid peace to have been carnal intereſts, worldly correſpondencies, and coalitions, ſtrengthened

            <p>We will add a few words for concluſion, and give a more particular account of this our <hi>Declaration.</hi> In drawing up this <hi>Confeſſion of Faith,</hi> we have had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us the <hi>Articles of Religion,</hi> approved and paſſed by both Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, after advice had with an <hi>Aſſembly of Divines,</hi> called together by them for <note place="margin">
                  <hi>June</hi> 20. 1648.</note>that purpoſe. To which Confeſſion, for the ſubſtance of it, we fully aſſent, as do our Brethren of <hi>New-England,</hi> and the Churches alſo of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as each in their general Synods have teſtified.</p>
            <p>A few things we have added for obviating ſome erroneous Opinions, that have been more broadly and boldly here of late maintained by the Aſſerters, then in former times; and made other additions and alterations in <hi>method,</hi> here and there, and ſome clearer Explanations, as we found occaſion.</p>
            <p>We have endeavoured throughout, to hold to ſuch Truths in this our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, as are more properly termed <hi>matters of Faith;</hi> and what is of <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order,</hi> we diſpoſe in certain Propoſitions by it ſelf. To this courſe we are led by the Example of the Honorable Houſes of Parliament, obſerving what was eſtabliſhed, and what omitted by them in that Confeſſion the Aſſembly preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them. Who thought it not convenient to have matters of Diſcipline and Church-Government put into a Confeſſion of Faith, eſpecially ſuch particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars thereof, as then were, and ſtill are controverted and under diſpute by men Orthodox and ſound in Faith.

Theſe were ſuch doubtful aſſertions, and ſo unſutable to a Confeſſion of Faith, as the Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Houſes in their great Wiſdom thought fit to lay them aſide: There be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing that tends more to heighten Diſſentions among Brethren, then to determine and adopt the matter of their difference, under ſo high a Title, as to be an Article of our Faith: So that there are two whole Chapters, and ſome Paragraphs in other Chapters in their Confeſſion, that we have upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count omitted; and the rather do we give this notice, becauſe that Copy of the <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Aug.</hi> 1647.</note>Parl. followed by us, is in few mens hands; the other as it came from the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, being approved of in <hi>Scotland,</hi> was printed and haſtened into the world, before the Parl, had declared their Reſolutions about it; which was not til <hi>June</hi>

            <p>After the 19th <hi>cap.</hi> of the Law, we have added a <hi>cap.</hi> of the Goſpel, it being a Title that may not well be omitted in a Confeſſion of Faith: In which Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, what is diſperſed, and by intimation in the Aſſemblies Confeſſion, with ſome little addition, is here brought together, and more fully, under one head.</p>
            <p>That there are not Scriptures annexed, as in ſome Confeſſions (though in divers others it's otherwiſe) we give the ſame account as did the <hi>Reverend Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly</hi> in the ſame caſe: which was this; <q rend="margQuotes">The Confeſſion being large, and <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Seſſion</hi> 786.</note>ſo framed, as to meet with the common Errors, if the Scriptures ſhould have been alleadged with any clearneſs, and by ſhewing where the ſtrength of the proof lieth, it would have required a Volume.</q> 
            </p>
            <p>We ſay further, it being our utmo&amp;;st end in this (as it is indeed of a <hi>Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)</hi> humbly to give an account what we hold and aſſert in theſe matters; that others, eſpecially the Churches of Chriſt may judge of us accordingly: This we aimed at, and not ſo much to inſtruct others, or convince gain-ſayers. Theſe are the proper works of other Inſtitutions of Chriſt, and are to be done in the ſtrength of expreſs Scripture. A <hi>Confeſſion</hi> is an Ordinance of another na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>What we have laid down and aſſerted about Churches and their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we humbly conceive to be the Order which Chriſt himſelf hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be obſerved, we have endeavored to follow Scripture light; and thoſe alſo that went before us according to that Rule, deſirous of neareſt uniformity with Reforming-Churches, as with our Brethren in <hi>New-England,</hi> ſo with others, that differ from them and Us.</p>
            <p>The Models and Platforms of this ſubject laid down by learned men, and practiſed by Churches, are various: We do not judge it brotherly, or grateful, to inſiſt upon compariſons, as ſome have done; but this Experience teacheth, That the variety, and poſſibly the Diſputes and Emulations ariſing thence, have much ſtrengthened, if not fixed, this unhappy perſwaſion in the mindes of ſome learned and good men, namely, That there is no ſetled Order laid down in Scripture; but it's left to the Prudence of the Chriſtian Magiſtrate, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe or make choice of ſuch a Form as is moſt ſutable and conſiſtent with their Civil-Government. Where this Opinion is entertained in the perſwaſion of Governors, there, Churches aſſerting their Powet and Order to be <hi>jure divino,</hi> and the appointment of Jeſus Chriſt, can have no better nor more honorable Entertainment, then a Toleration or Permiſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:115309:8"/>
               <hi>Yet herein there is this remarkable advantage to all parties that differ, about what in Government is of Chriſt's appointment;</hi> in that ſuch Magiſtrates have a far greater latitude in conſcience, to tolerate and permit the ſeveral forms of each ſo bound up in their perſwaſion, then they have to ſubmit unto what the Magiſtrate ſhall impoſe: And thereupon the Magiſtrate exerciſing an indulgency and forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, with protection and encouragement to the people of God, ſo differing from him, and amongſt themſelves: Doth therein diſcharge as great a faithfulneſs to Chriſt, and love to his people, as can any way be ſuppoſed and expected from any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Magiſtrate, of what perſwaſion ſoever he is. And where this clemency from Governors is ſhewed to any ſort of perſons, or Churches of Chriſt, upon ſuch a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, it will in equity produce this juſt effect, That all that ſo differ from him, and amongſt themſelves, ſtanding in equal and alike difference from the principle of ſuch a Magiſtrate, he is equally free to give a like liberty to them, one as well as the other.</p>
            <p>This faithfulneſs in our Governours we do with thankfulneſs to God acknowledge, and to their everlaſting honour, which appeared much in the late Reformation. The <hi>Hierarchie, Common-Prayer-Book,</hi> and all other things grievous to God's People, being removed, they made choice of an Aſſembly of learned men, to adviſe what Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Order is meet to be eſtabliſhed in the room of theſe things; and becauſe it was known there were different opinions (as always hath been among Godly men) about forms of Church-Government, there was by the Ordinance firſt ſent forth to call an Aſſembly, not onely a choice made of perſons of ſeveral perſwaſions, to ſit as Members there, but liberty given, to a leſſer number, if diſſenting, to report their Judgments and Reaſons, as well and as freely as the <hi>major part.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hereupon the Honorable Houſe of Commons (an Indulgence we hope will never be forgotten) finding by Papers received from them, that the Members of the Aſſembly were not like to compoſe differences amongſt themſelves, ſo as to joyn in the ſame Rule for Church-Government, did order further as followeth: That a Committee of Lords and Commons, &amp;c. do take into conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the differences of the Opinions in the Aſſembly of Divines in point of Church-government, and to endeavor a union if it be poſſible; and in caſe that cannot be done, to endeavor the finding out ſome may, how far tender conſciences, who cannot in all things ſubmit to the ſame Rule which ſhal be eſtabliſhed, may be born with according to the Word, and as may ſtand with the Publique Peace.</p>
            <p>By all which it is evident, the Parliament purpoſed not to eſtabliſh the Rule of Church-Government with ſuch rigor, as might not permit and bear with a practiſe different from what they had eſtabliſhed: In perſons and Churches of different principles, if occaſion were. And this Chriſtian Clemency and indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in our Governours, hath been the foundation of that <hi>Freedom and Liberty,</hi> in the managing of Church-affairs, which <hi>our Brethren,</hi> as well as <hi>W E,</hi> that differ from them, do now, and have many years enjoyed.</p>
            <p>The Honorable Houſes by ſeveral Ordinances of Parliament after much conſultation, having ſetled Rules for Church-Government, and <hi>ſuch an Eccleaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical</hi>

               <hi>Opinions to be,</hi> That there is not a compleat Rule in thoſe Ordinances; <hi>alſo,</hi> that there are many neceſſary things not yet eſtabliſhed, and ſome things wherein their conſciences are not ſo fully ſatisfied. <hi>Theſe Brethren, in the ſame Paper, have publiſhed alſo their joynt</hi> Reſolution to practiſe in all things according to the Rule of the Word, and according to theſe Ordinances, ſo far as they conceive them cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond to it, and in ſo doing, they truſt they ſhall not grieve the Spirit of the truly godly, nor give any just occaſion to them that are contrary minded, to blame their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.</p>
            <p>We humbly conceive that <hi>(WE</hi> being diſſatisfied in theſe things as our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren) the like liberty was intended by the Honorable Houſes and may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by us of the <hi>Congregational way</hi> (without blame or grief to the ſpirits of thoſe <hi>Brethren</hi> at leaſt) to reſolve, or rather to continue in the ſame Reſolution and Practiſe in theſe matters, which indeed were our practiſes in times of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt oppoſition, and before this Reformation was began.</p>
            <p>And as our Brethren <hi>the Miniſters of London,</hi> drew up and publiſhed their <hi>opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions</hi> and <hi>apprehenſions</hi> about Church-Government into an intire Syſtem; ſo we now give the like publique account of our Conſciences, and the Rules by which we have conſtantly practiſed hitherto; which we have here drawn up, and do preſent. Whereby it will appear how much, or how little we differ in theſe things from our Presbyterian Brethren.</p>
            <p>And we truſt there is no juſt cauſe why any man, either for our differing from the preſent ſettlement, it being out of Conſcience, and not out of <hi>contempt,</hi> or our differences one from another, being not <hi>wilful,</hi> ſhould charge either of us with that odious reproach of <hi>Schiſm.</hi> And indeed, if not for our d ffering from <note place="margin">

And let it be further conſidered, that we have not broken from them or their Order by theſe differences (but rather they from us) and in that reſpect we leſs deſerve their cenſure; our practiſe being no other then what it was in our breaking from Epiſcopacy, and long before Presbytery, or any ſuch form as now they are in, was taken up by them; and we will not ſay how probable it is, that the yoke of Epiſcopacy had been upon our neck to this day, if ſome ſuch way (as formerly, and now is, and hath been termed <hi>Schiſm)</hi> had not with much ſuffering bin then practiſed, and ſince continued in.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Novelty</hi> wherewith we are likewiſe both charged by the Enemies of both, it is true, in reſpect of the publique and open Profeſſion, either of Presbytery or Independency, this Nation hath been a ſtranger to each way, it's poſſible, ever ſince it hath been Chriſtian; though for our ſ lves we are able to trace the foot-ſteps of an Independent Congregational way in the ancienteſt cuſtoms of the Churches; as alſo in the Writings of our ſoundeſt Proteſtant Divines, and (that which we are much ſatified in) a full concurrence throughout in all the ſubſtantial parts of Church-Government, with our Reverend Brethren the <hi>old Puritan Non-conformiſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

And now therefore ſeeing the Lord, in whoſe hand is the heart of Princes, hath put into the hearts of our Governours to tolerate and permit (as they have done many years) perſons of each perſwaſion, to enjoy their Conſciences, though neither come up to the <hi>Rule eſtabliſhed by Authority:</hi> And that which is more, to give us both Protection, and the ſame encouragement, that the moſt devoted <hi>Conformiſts</hi> in thoſe former Superſtitious Times enjoyed; yea, and by a publike Law to eſtaliſh this Liberty for time to come; and yet further, in the midſt of our fears, to ſet over us a Prince that owns this Eſtabliſhment, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially reſolves to ſecure our Churches in the enjoyment of theſe Liberties, if we abuſe them not to the diſturbance of the Civil Peace.</p>
            <p>This ſhould be a very great engagement upon the hearts of all, though of different perſwaſions, to endeavour our utmoſt, joyntly to promove the honour and proſperity of ſuch a Government and Governours by whatſoever means, which in our Callings as Miniſters of the Goſpel, and as Churches of Jeſus Chriſt the Prince of Peace, we are any way able to do; as alſo to be peaceably diſpoſed one towards another, and with mutual toleration to love as brethren, notwithſtanding ſuch differences: remembring, as it's very equal we ſhould, the differences that are between <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Independents,</hi> being differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween fellow-ſervants, and neither of them having authority given from God or Man, to impoſe their Opinions, one more then the other. That our Governours after ſo ſolemn an eſtabliſhment, ſhould thus bear with us both, in our greater differences from their Rule: and after this, for any of us <hi>to take a fellow-ſervant by the throat,</hi> upon the account of a leſſer reckoning, and nothing due to <hi>him</hi> upon it, is to forget, at leaſt not to exerciſe, that compaſſion and tenderneſs we have found, where we had leſs ground to challenge or expect it.</p>
            <p>Our Prayer unto God is, That whereto we have already attained, we all may walk by the ſame rule, and that wherein we are otherwiſe minded, God would reveal it to us in his due time.</p>

And the heavenlineſs of the Matter, the efficacy of the Doctrine, the Maieſty of the Style, the conſent of all the parts, the ſcope of the whole, (which is, to give all glory to God) the full diſcovery it makes of the only way of Mans Salvation, the many other incomparable excellencies, and the intire perfection thereof, are Arguments whereby it doth abundantly evidence it ſelf to be the Word of God; Yet notwithſtanding, our full perſwaſion and aſſurance of the infallible Truth and Divine Authority thereof, is from the inward work of the holy Spirit, bearing witneſs by and with the Word in our hearts.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. The whole Counſel of God concerning all things neceſſary for his own Glory, mans Salvation, Faith, and Life, is either expreſly ſet down in Scripture, or by good and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conſequence may be deduced from Scripture; unto which nothing at any time is to be added, whether by new Revelations of the Spirit, or Traditions of men. Nevertheleſs we acknowledge the inward illumination of the ſpirit of God to be neceſſary for the ſaving underſtanding of ſuch things as are revealed in the Word: And that there are ſome circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances concerning the Worſhip of God and Government of the Church, common to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane actions and Societies, which are to be ordered by the Light of Nature and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an prudence, according to the general Rules of the Word, which are always to be obſerved.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. All things in Scripture are not alike plain in themſelves, nor alike clear unto all: yet thoſe things which are neceſſary to be known, believed, and obſerved for Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are ſo clearly propounded and opened in ſome place of Scripture or other, that not only the learned, but the unlearned, in a due uſe of the ordinary means, may attain unto a ſufficient underſtanding of them.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. The Old Teſtament in Hebrew (which was the Native Language of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God of old) and the New Teſtament in Greek (which at the time of writing of it was moſt generally known to the Nations) being immediately inſpired by God, and by his ſingular care and providence kept pure in all Ages, are therefore Authentical; ſo as in all Controverſies of Religion, the Church is finally to appeal unto them. But becauſe theſe Original Tongues are not known to all the people of God, who have right unto, and intereſt
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:115309:10"/>
in the Scriptures, and are commanded in the fear of God to read and ſearch them; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are to be tranſlated into the Vulgar language of every Nation unto which they come, that the Word of God dwelling plentifully in all, they may worſhip him in an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable manner, and through patience and comfort of the Scriptures may have hope.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. The infallible Rule of Interpretation of Scripture, is the Scripture it ſelf. And therefore when there is a queſtion about the true and full ſenſe of any Scripture (which is not manifold, but one) it muſt be ſearched and known by other places, that ſpeak more clearly.</p>
               <p n="10">X. The Supreme Judge by which all controverſies of Religion are to be determined, and all Decrees of Councils, Opinions of ancient Writers, Doctrines of men and private Spirits, are to be examined, and in whoſe Sentence we are to reſt, can be no other, but the holy Scripture delivered by the Spirit; into which Scripture ſo delivered, our Faith is finally reſolved.</p>

               <p n="2">II. God hath all Life, Glory, Goodneſs, Bleſſedneſs, in, and of himſelf; and is alone in, and unto himſelf, All-ſufficient, not ſtanding in need of any Creatures, which he hath made, nor deriving any glory from them, but onely manifeſting his own glory in, by, unto, and upon them: He is the alone Fountain of all Being, of whom, through whom, and to whom are all things; and hath moſt Soveraign dominion over them, to do by them, for them, or upon them, whatſoever himſelf pleaſeth: In his ſight all things are open and manifeſt, his Knowledge is infinite, infallible, and independent upon the creature, ſo as nothing is to him contingent or uncertain: He is moſt holy in all his Counſels, in all his Works, and in all his Commands.

               <head>CHAP. III. Of Gods Eternal Decree.</head>
               <p>GOD from all eternity did by the moſt wiſe and holy Counſel of his own Will, freely and unchangeably ordain whatſoever comes to paſſe: Yet ſo, as thereby neither is God the Author of ſin, nor is violence offered to the will of the Creatures, nor is the liberty or contingency of ſecond Cauſes taken away, but rather eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Although God knowes whatſoever may or can come to paſs upon all ſuppoſed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, yet hath he not decreed any thing, becauſe he foreſaw it as future, or as that which would come to paſſe upon ſuch Conditions.</p>
               <p n="3">III. By the Decree of God for the manifeſtation of his Glory, ſome Men and Angels are predeſtinated unto everlaſting Life, and others fore-ordained to everlaſting Death.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Theſe Angels and Men thus predeſtinated, and fore-ordained, are particularly and unchangeably deſigned; and their number is ſo certain and definite, that it cannot be either increaſed or diminiſhed.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Thoſe of mankind that are predeſtinated unto Life, God, before the foundation of the world was laid, according to his eternal and immutable purpoſe, and the ſecret counſel and good pleaſure of his Will, hath choſen in Chriſt unto everlaſting Glory, out of his meer free Grace and Love, without any ſore-ſight of Faith or good Works, or perſeverance in either of them, or any other thing in the Creature, as Conditions or Cauſes moving him thereunto, and all to the praiſe of his glorious Grace.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. As God hath appointed the Elect unto Glory, ſo hath he by the eternal and moſt free purpoſe of his Will fore-ordained all the means thereunto: Wherefore they who are elected, being faln in Adam, are redeemed by Chriſt, are effectually called unto Faith in Chriſt by his Spirit working in due ſeaſon, are juſtified, adopted, ſanctified, and kept by his power, through Faith, unto ſalvation. Neither are any other redeemed by Chriſt, or effectually called, juſtified, adopted, ſanctified, and ſaved, but the Elect onely.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. The reſt of mankind God was pleaſed, according to the unſearchable Counſel of his own Will, whereby he extendeth or withholdeth mercy, as he pleaſeth, for the glory of his ſoveraign power over his Creatures, to paſſe by and to ordain them to diſhonour and wrath for their ſin, to the praiſe of his glorious Juſtice.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. The Doctrine of this high myſtery of Predeſtination, is to be handled with ſpecial prudence and care, that men attending the will of God revealed in his Word, and yielding obedience thereunto, may from the certainty of their effectual Vocation, be aſſured of their eternal Election.

Beſides this Law written in their hearts, they received a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand not to eat of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil; which whiles they kept, they were happy in their communion with God, and had dominion over the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>

               <p>GOD the great Creator of all things, doth uphold, direct, diſpoſe and govern all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, actions and things from the greateſt even to the leaſt, by his moſt wiſe and holy Providence, according unto his infallible fore-knowledge, and the free and immutable coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of his own Will, to the praiſe of the glory of his Wiſdom, Power, Juſtice, Goodneſs and Mercy.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Although in relation to the fore-knowledge and decree of God, the firſt Cauſe, all things come to paſſe immutably, and infallibly; yet by the ſame Providence he ordereth them to fall out, according to the nature of ſecond Cauſes, either neceſſarily, freely, or contingently.</p>
               <p n="3">III. God in his ordinary Providence maketh uſe of Means, yet is free to work with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, above, and againſt them at his pleaſure.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The almighty Power, unſearchable Wiſdom, and infinite Goodneſs of God, ſo far manifeſt themſelves in his Providence, in that his determinate Counſel, extendeth it ſelf even to the firſt Fall, and all other ſins of Angels and Men (and that not by a bare permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) which alſo he moſt wiſely and powerfully<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> boundeth, and otherwiſe ordereth and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneth in a manifold Diſpenſation to his own moſt holy ends; yet ſo, as the ſinfulneſſe thereof proceedeth onely from the Creature, and not from God, who being moſt holy and righteous, neither is, nor can be, the author or approver of ſin.</p>
               <p n="5">V. The moſt wiſe righteous and gracious God, doth oftentimes leave for a ſeaſon his own children to manifold temptations, and the corruption of their own hearts, to chaſtiſe them for their former ſins, or to diſcover unto them the hidden ſtrength of corruption, and deceitfulneſs of their hearts, that they may be humbled; and to raiſe them to a more cloſe and conſtant dependance for their ſupport upon himſelf, and to make them more watchfull againſt all future occaſions of ſin, and for ſandry other juſt and holy ends.</p>

As for thoſe wicked and ungodly men, whom God as a righteous Judge, for former ſins, doth blind and harden, from them he not onely withholdeth his grace, whereby they might have been inlightned in their underſtandings, and wrought upon in their hearts; but ſometimes alſo withdraweth the gifts which they had, and expoſeth them to ſuch objects, as their corruption makes occaſions of ſin; and withall gives them over to their own luſts, the temptations of the wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <p>GOD having made a Covenant of Works and Life, thereupon, with our firſt Parents, and all their poſterity in them, they being ſeduced by the ſubtilty and temptation of Satan, did wilfully tranſgreſs the Law of their Creation, and break the Covenant in eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the forbidden fruit.</p>
               <p n="2">II. By this ſin they, and we in them, fell from original righteouſneſſe and communion with God, and ſo became dead in ſin, and wholly defiled in all the faculties and parts of ſoul and body.</p>
               <p n="3">III. They being the Root, and by Gods appointment ſtanding in the room and ſtead of all mankind, the guilt of this ſin was imputed, and corrupted nature conveyed to all their poſterity deſcending from them by ordinary generation.</p>

               <p n="5">V. This Corruption of nature during this life, doth remain in thoſe that are regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and although it be through Chriſt pardoned and mortified, yet both it ſelf and all the motions thereof are truly and properly ſin.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Every ſin, both original and actual, being a tranſgreſſion of the righteous Law of God, and contrary thereunto, doth in its own nature bring guilt upon the ſinner, whereby he is bound over to the wrath of God, and curſe of the Law, and ſo made ſubject to death, with all miſeries ſpiritual, temporal, and eternal.</p>

               <p n="2">II. The firſt Covenant made with man, was a Covenant of Works, wherein life was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to Adam, and in him to his poſterity, upon condition of perfect and perſonal obedience.</p>
               <p n="3">III.

               <p n="4">IV. This Covenant of Grace is frequently ſet forth in the Scripture by the name of a Teſtament, in reference to the death of Jeſus Chriſt the Teſtator, and to the everlaſting In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, with all things belonging to it, therein bequeathed.</p>

               <p n="3">III. The Lord Jeſus in his Humane nature, thus united to the Divine in the Perſon of the Son, was ſanctified and anointed with the holy Spirit above meaſure, having in him all the treaſures of Wiſdom and Knowledge, in whom it pleaſed the Father that all fulneſſe ſhould dwell, to the end that being holy, harmleſſe, undefiled, and full of Grace and Truth, he might be throughly furniſhed to execute the Office of a Mediator and Surety; which Office he took not unto himſelf, but was thereunto called by his Father, who alſo put all Power and Judgment into his hand, and gave him Commandment to execute the ſame.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. This Office the Lord Jeſus did moſt willingly undertake; which that he might diſcharge, he was made under the Law, and did perfectly fulfil it; and under went the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment due to us, which we ſhould have born and ſuffered: being made ſin and curſe for us, enduring moſt grievous torments immediately from God in his ſoul, and moſt painful ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings in his body, was crucified, and died, was buried, and remained under the power of death, yet ſaw no corruption; on the third day he aroſe from the dead with the ſame Body in which he ſuffered, with which alſo he aſcended into heaven, and there ſitteth at the right hand of his Father, making interceſſion, and ſhall return to judge Men and Angels at the end of the World.</p>
               <p n="5">V. The Lord Jeſus by his perfect obedience and ſacrifice of himſelf, which he through the eternal Spirit once offered up unto God, hath fully ſatisfied the Juſtice of God, and purchaſed not onely reconciliation, but an everlaſting inheritance in the Kingdom of heaven, for all thoſe whom the Father hath given unto him.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Although the work of Redemption was not actually wrought by Chriſt, till after his Incarnation; yet the vertue, efficacy and benefits thereof were communicated to the Elect in all Ages, ſucceſſively from the beginning of the World, in and by thoſe Promiſes, Types, and Sacrifices, wherein he was revealed and ſignified to be the ſeed of the Woman, which ſhould bruiſe the Serpent's head, and the Lamb ſlain from the beginning of the World, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yeſterday and to day the ſame, and for ever.</p>

               <p>THoſe whom God effectually calleth, he alſo freely juſtifieth, not by infuſing righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe into them, but by pardoning their ſins, and by accounting and accepting their perſons as righteous, not for any thing wrought in them, or done by them, but for Chriſts ſake alone; nor by imputing Faith it ſelf, the act of believing, or any other Evangelical obedience to them, as their righteouſneſs, but by imputing Chriſts active obedience unto the whole Law, and paſſive obedience in his death, for their whole and ſole righteouſneſs, they receiving and reſting on him and his righteouſneſs by Faith; which Faith they have not of themſelves, it is the gift of God.</p>
               <p n="2">II.

               <p n="3">III. Chriſt by his Obedience and Death did fully diſcharge the Debt of all thoſe that are juſtified, and did by the ſacrifice of himſelf, in the blood of his Croſs, undergoing in their ſtead the penalty due unto them, make a proper, real, and full ſatisfaction to Gods Juſtice in their behalf: Yet, in as much as he was given by the Father for them, and his Obedience and Satisfaction accepted in their ſtead, and both freely, not for any thing in them, their juſtification is only of free grace, that both the exact juſtice and rich grace of God might be glorified in the juſtification of ſinners.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. God did from all eternity decree to juſtifie all the Elect, and Chriſt did in the fulneſs of time dye for their ſins, and riſe again for their juſtification: Nevertheleſs, they are not juſtified perſonally, until the holy Spirit doth in due time actually apply Chriſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them.</p>

               <p n="2">II. By this Faith a Chriſtian believeth to be true whatſoever is revealed in the Word, for the Authority of God himſelf ſpeaking therein, and acteth differently upon that which each particular paſſage thereof containeth, yielding obedience to the commands, trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling at the threatnings, and embracing the promiſes of God for this life, and that which is to come.

This Faith, although it be different in degrees, and may be weak or ſtrong, yet it is in the leaſt degree of it different in the kind or nature of it (as is all other ſaving grace) from the faith and common grace of temporary believers; and therefore, though it may be many times aſſailed and weakened, yet it gets the victory, growing up in many to the attainment of a full aſſurance through Chriſt, who is both the author and finiſher of our Faith.</p>

               <p>SUch of the Elect as are converted at riper years, having ſometime lived in the ſtate of nature, and therein ſerved divers luſts and pleaſures, God in their effectual calling gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth them Repentance unto life.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Whereas there is none that doth good, and ſinneth not, and the beſt of men may through the power and deceitfulneſs of their corruptions dwelling in them, with the preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of temptation, fall into great ſins and provocations; God hath in the Covenant of Grace mercifully provided, that Believers ſo ſinning and falling, be renewed through repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance unto Salvation.</p>
               <p n="3">III. This ſaving Repentance is an Evangelical Grace, whereby a perſon being by the holy Ghoſt made ſenſible of the manifold evils of his ſin, doth by Faith in Chriſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble himſelf for it with godly ſorrow, deteſtation of it, and ſelf-abhorrency, praying for pardon and ſtrength of Grace, with a purpoſe and endeavour by ſupplies of the ſpirit, to walk before God unto all well-pleaſing in all things.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. As Repentance is to be continued through the whole courſe of our lives, upon the account of the body of death, and the motions thereof; ſo it is every mans duty to repent of his particular known ſins particularly.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Such is the proviſion which God hath made through Chriſt in the covenant of Grace, for the preſervation of Believers unto ſalvation, that although there is no ſin ſo ſmall but it deſerves damnation; yet here is no ſin ſo great, that it ſhall bring damnation on them who truly repent; which makes the conſtant preaching of Repentance neceſſary.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XVI. Of good Works.</head>
               <p>GOod works are only ſuch as God hath commanded in his holy Word, and not ſuch as without the warrant thereof are deviſed by men our of blind zeal, or upon any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of good intentions.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Theſe good Works done in obedience to Gods commandments, are the fruits and evidences of a true and lively Faith, and by them Believers manifeſt their thankfulneſſe, ſtrengthen their aſſurance, edifie their Brethren, adorn the profeſſion of the Goſpel, ſtop the mouths of the adverſaries, and glorifie God, whoſe workmanſhip they are, created in in Chriſt Jeſus thereunto, that having their fruit unto holineſs, they may have the end eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Their ability to do good works is not at all of themſelves, but wholly from the Spirit of Chriſt: And that they may be enabled thereunto, beſides the graces they have already received, there is required an actual influence of the ſame holy Spirit, to work in them to will and to do of his good pleaſure; yet are they not hereupon to grow negligent, as if they were not bound to perform any duty, unleſs upon a ſpecial motion of the Spirit, but they ought to be diligent in ſtirring up the grace of God that is in them.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. They who in their obedience attain to the greateſt height which is poſſible in this life, are ſo far from being able to ſuperogate, and to do more then God requires, as that they fall ſhort of much, which in duty they are bound to do.</p>

V. We cannot by our beſt works merit pardon of ſin, or eternal life at the hand of God, by reaſon of the great diſproportion that is between them, and the glory to come; and the infinite diſtance that is between us, and God, whom by them we can neither profit, nor ſatisfie for the debt of our former ſins; but when we have done all we can, we have done but our duty, and are unprofitable ſervants: and becauſe as they are good, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from his Spirit; and as they are wrought by us, they are defiled and mixed with ſo much weakneſs and imperfection, that they cannot endure the ſeverity of Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Yet notwithſtanding, the perſons of Believers being accepted through Chriſt, their good works alſo are accepted in him; not as though they were in this life wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable and unreproveable in Gods ſight, but that he looking upon them in his Son, is pleaſed to accept and reward that which is ſincere, although accompanied with many weakneſſes and imperfections.</p>

Works done by unregenerate men, although for the matter of them they may be things which God commands, and of good uſe both to themſelves and to others: yet becauſe they proceed not from a heart purified by Faith, nor are done in a right manner, according to the Word, nor to a right end, the glory of God; they are therefore ſinful, and cannot pleaſe God, nor make a man meet to receive grace from God; and yet their neglect of them is more ſinful, and diſpleaſing unto Cod.</p>

               <p n="2">II.

               <p>ALthough temporary believers, and other unregenerate men may vainly deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with falſe hopes, and carnal preſumptions of being in the favour of God, and ſtate of ſalvation, which hope of theirs ſhall periſh; yet ſuch as truly believe in the Lord Jeſus, and love him in ſincerity, endeavouring to walk in all good conſcience before him, may in this life be certainly aſſured that they are in the ſtate of Grace, and may rejoyce in the hope of the glory of God; which hope ſhall never make them aſhamed.</p>
               <p n="2">II. This certainty is not a bare conjectural and probable perſwaſion, grounded upon a fallible hope, but an infallible aſſurance of faith, founded on the blood and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſt, revealed in the Goſpel, and alſo upon the inward evidence of thoſe graces unto which Promiſes are made, and on the immediate witneſſe of the Spirit, teſtifying our Adoption, and as a fruit thereof, leaving the heart more humble and holy.</p>
               <p n="3">III. This infallible Aſſurance doth not ſo belong to the eſſence of Faith, but that a true believer may wait long, and conflict with many difficulties before he be partaker of it; yet being inabled by the Spirit to know the things which are freely given him of God, he may without extraordinary revelation, in the right uſe of ordinary means attain thereunto: And therefore it is the duty of every one, to give all diligence to make his calling and election ſure, that thereby his heart may be inlarged in peace and joy in the holy Ghoſt, in love and thankfulneſſe to God, and in ſtrength and chearfulneſſe in the duties of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, the proper fruits of this aſſurance; ſo far is it from inclining men to looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. True Believers may have the aſſurance of their ſalvation divers wayes ſhaken, diminiſhed, and intermitted; as by negligence in preſerving of it, by falling into ſome ſpecial ſin, which woundeth the conſcience, and grieveth the Spirit, by ſome ſudden or vehement temptation, by Gods withdrawing the light of his countenance, ſuffering even ſuch as fear him to walk in darkneſſe, and to have no light; yet are they neither utterly deſtitute of that ſeed of God, and life of Faith, that love of Chriſt and the Brethren, that ſincerity of heart, and conſcience of duty, out of which, by the operation of the Spirit, this aſſurance may in due time be revived; and by the which in the mean time, they are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported from utter deſpair.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIX. Of the Law of God.</head>

               <p n="2">II. This Law ſo written in the heart, continued to be a perfect Rule of Righteouſneſs after the fall of man, and was delivered by God upon Mount Sinai in Ten Commandments,

and written in two Tables; the four firſt Commandments containing our duty towards God, and the other ſix our duty to Man.</p>

               <p n="4">IV. To them alſo he gave ſundry Judicial Laws, which expired together with the State of that people, not obliging any now by vertue of that Inſtitution, their general equity one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly being ſtill of moral uſe.</p>
               <p n="5">V. The Moral Law doth for ever bind all, as well juſtified perſons as others, to the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience thereof; and that not onely in regard of the matter contained in it, but alſo in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Authority of God the Creator, who gave it: neither doth Chriſt in the Goſpel any way diſſolve, but much ſtrengthen this obligation.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Although true Believers be not under the Law, as a Covenant of Works, to be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by juſtified or condemned; yet it is of great uſe to them as well as to others, in that, as a rule of life, inform ng them of the Will of God, and their duty, it directs and binds them to walk accordingly, diſcovering alſo the ſinful pollutions of their Nature, Hearts, &amp; Lives, ſo as examining themſelves thereby, they may come to further conviction of humiliation for, and hatred againſt ſin, together with a clearer ſight of the need they have of Chriſt, &amp; the perfection of his obedience. It is likewiſe of uſe to the Regenerate, to reſtrain their Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, in that it forbids ſin, and the threatnings of it ſerve to ſhew what even their ſins deſerve, and what afflictions in this life they may expect for them, although freed from the curſe thereof threatned in the Law.

               <p n="7">VII. Neither are the fore-mentioned uſes of the Law contrary to the grace of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; but do ſweetly comply with it, the Spirit of Chriſt ſubduing and inabling the Will of Man to do that freely and chearfully, which the Will of God revealed in the Law requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be done.</p>

               <p>THe Covenant of Works being broken by ſin, and made unprofitable unto life, God was pleaſed to give unto the Elect the promiſe of Chriſt, the Seed of the Woman, as the means of calling them, and begetting in them Faith and Repentance: In this Promiſe, the Goſpel, as to the ſubſtance of it, was revealed, and was therein effectual for the converſion and ſalvation of ſinners.</p>
               <p n="2">II. This promiſe of Chriſt, and ſalvation by him, is revealed onely in and by the Word of God; neither do the works of Creation or Providence, with the Light of Nature, make diſcovery of Chriſt, or of Grace by him, ſo much as in a general or obſcure way; much leſs that men deſtitute of the revelation of him by the Promiſe or Goſpel, ſhould be inabled thereby to attain ſaving Faith or Repentance.</p>

III. The revelation of the Goſpel unto ſinners made in divers times, and by ſundry parts, with the addition of Promiſes and Precepts for the obedience required therein, as to the Nations and Perſons to whom it is granted, is meerly of the Soveraign will and good pleaſure of God, not being annexed by vertue of any promiſe to the due improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of mens natural abilities, by vertue of common light received without it, which none ever did make, or can ſo do: And therefore in all ages the Preaching of the Goſpel hath been granted unto perſons and Nations, as to the extent or ſtraitning of it, in great variety, according to the counſel of the will of God.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Although the Goſpel be the onely outward means of revealing Chriſt and ſaving Grace, and is as ſuch abundantly ſufficient thereunto; yet that men who are dead in treſpaſſes, may be born again, quickned, or regenerated, there is moreover neceſſary an effectual, irreſiſtible work of the Holy Ghoſt upon the whole ſoul, for the producing in them a new ſpiritual life, without which no other means are ſufficient for their converſion unto God.</p>

               <p>THe Liberty which Chriſt hath purchaſed for Believers under the Goſpel, conſiſts in their freedom from the guilt of ſin, the condemning wrath of God, the rigour and curſe of the Law, and in their being delivered from this preſent evil world, bondage to Satan, and dominion of ſin, from the evil of afflictions, the fear and ſting of death, the victory of the grave, and everlaſting damnation; as alſo in their free acceſs to God, and their yielding obedience unto him, not out of ſlaviſh fear, but a child-like-love, and willing mind: All which were common alſo to Believers under the Law, for the ſubſtance of them; but under the New Teſtament the liberty of Chriſtians is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inlarged in their freedom from the yoake of the Ceremonial Law, the whole Legal adminiſtration of the Covenant of Grace, to which the Jewiſh Church was ſubjected, and in greater boldneſs of acceſs to the Throne of Grace, and in fuller communications of the free Spirit of God, then Believers under the Law did ordinarily partake of.</p>
               <p n="2">II. God alone is Lord of the Conſcience, and hath left it free from the Doctrines and Commandments of men, which are in any thing contrary to his Word, or not contained in it; ſo that to believe ſuch Doctrines, or to obey ſuch Commands out of conſcience, is to betray true Liberty of Conſcience; and the requiring of an implicit faith, and an abſolute and blind obedience, is to deſtroy Liberty of Conſcience, and Reaſon alſo.</p>
               <p n="3">III. They who upon pretence of Chriſtian Liberty, do practiſe any ſin, or cheriſh any luſt, as they do thereby pervert the main deſign of the Grace of the Goſpel to their own deſtruction; ſo they wholly deſtroy the end of Chriſtian Liberty, which is, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing delivered out of the hands of our enemies, we might ſerve the Lord without fear, in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe before him all the dayes of our life.</p>

Prayer with thankſgiving, being one ſpecial part of natural worſhip, is by God required of all men; but that it may be accepted, it is to be made in the name of the Son, by the help of the Spirit, according to his will, with underſtanding, reverence, humility, fervency, faith, love, and perſeverance; and when with others in a known tongue.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Prayer is to be made for things lawful, and for all ſorts of men living, or that ſhall live hereafter, but not for the dead, nor for thoſe of whom it may be known that they have ſinned the ſin unto death.</p>
               <p n="5">V. The reading of the Scriptures, Preaching, and hearing the word of God, ſinging of Pſalms, as alſo the adminiſtration of Baptiſm and the Lords Supper, are all parts of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Worſhip of God, to be performed in obedience unto God with underſtanding, faith, reverence, and godly fear: Solemn Humiliations, with Faſtings and Thankſgiving upon ſpecial occaſions, are in their ſeveral times and ſeaſons to be uſed in a holy and religious manner.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Neither Prayer nor any other part of religious Worſhip, is now under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel either tyed unto, or made more acceptable by any place, in which it is performed, or towards which it is directed; but God is to be worſhipped every where in ſpirit and in truth, as in private families daily, and in ſecret each one by himſelf, ſo more ſolemnly in the publique aſſemblies, which are not careleſly nor wilfully to be neglected, or forſaken, when God by his Word or Providence calleth thereunto.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. As it is of the Law of Nature, that in general a proportion of time by Gods appointment be ſet apart for the worſhip of God; ſo by his Word in a poſitive, moral, and perpetual commandment, binding all men in all ages, he hath particularly appointed one day in ſeaven for a Sabbath to be kept holy unto him, which from the beginning of the world to the reſurrection of Chriſt, was the laſt day of the week, and from the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt was changed into the firſt day of the week, which in Scripture, is called the Lords day, and is to be continued to the end of the World as the Chriſtian Sabbath, the obſervation of the laſt day of the week being aboliſhed.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. This Sabbath is then kept holy unto the Lord, when men after a due preparing of their hearts, and ordering their common affaires before hand, do not only obſerve an holy reſt all the day from their own works, words, and thoughts about their worldly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments and recreations, but alſo are taken up the whole time in the publique and private exerciſesof his Worſhip, and in the duties of Neceſſity and Mercy.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXIII. Of lawful Oaths and Vows.</head>
               <p>A Lawful Oath is a part of Religious Worſhip, wherein the perſon ſwearing in truth, righteouſneſs, and judgment, ſolemnly calleth God to witneſs what he afferteth or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth, and to judge him according to the truth or falſhood of what he ſweareth.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The name of God onely is that by which men ought to ſwear; and therein it is to be uſed with all holy fear and reverence: Therefore to ſwear vainly, or raſhly, by that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious or dreadful Name, or to ſweat at all by any other thing, is ſinful and to be abhorred: Yet as in matters of weight and moment an Oath is warranted by the Word of God under the New Teſtament, as well as under the Old; ſo a lawful Oath, being impoſed by lawful authority in ſuch matters, ought to be taken.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Whoſoever taketh an Oath warranted by the Word of God, ought duly to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the weightineſs of ſo ſolemn an act, and therein to avouch nothing but what he is fully perſwaded is the truth: neither may any man bind himſelf by Oath to any thing, but what is good and juſt, and what he believeth ſo to be, and what he is able and reſolved to perform. Yet it is a ſin to refuſe an Oath touching any thing that is good and juſt, being lawfully impoſed by Authority.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. An Oath is to be taken in the plain and common ſenſe of the words, without equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, or mental reſervation: It cannot oblige to ſin, but in any thing not ſinful, being taken it binds to performance, although to a mans own hurt; nor is it to be violated, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though made to Hereticks or Infidels.</p>
               <p n="5">V. A Vow, which is not to be made to any Creature, but God alone, is of the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with a promiſſory Oath, and ought to be made with the like religious care, and to be performed with the like faithfulneſs.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Popiſh monaſtical Vows of perpetual ſingle life, profeſſed poverty, and regular obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, are ſo far from being degrees of higher perfection, that they are ſuperſtitious and ſinful ſnares, in which no Chriſtian may intangle himſelf.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXIV. Of the civil Magistrate.</head>
               <p>GOD the ſupreme Lord and King of all the World, hath ordained civil Magiſtrates to be under him, over the people for his own glory and the publique good: And to this end hath armed them with the power of the Sword, for the defence and incouragement of them that do good; and for the puniſhment of evil-doers.</p>
               <p n="2">II. It is lawful for Chriſtians to accept and execute the Office of a Magiſtrate, when cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led thereunto: in the management whereof, as they ought ſpecially to maintain Juſtice and Peace, according to the wholſome Laws of each Common-wealth; ſo for that end they may lawfully now under the New Teſtament wage war upon juſt and neceſſary occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Although the Magiſtrate is bound to incourage, promote, and protect the Profeſſors and Profeſſion of the Goſpel, and to manage and order civil adminiſtrations in a due ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerviency to the intereſt of Chriſt in the World, and to that end to take care that

men of coroupt minds and converſations do not licentiouſly publiſh and divulge Blaſphemy and Errors, in their own nature ſubverting the faith, and inevitably deſtroying the ſouls of them that receive them: Yet in ſuch differences about the Doctrines of the Goſpel, or ways of the worſhip of God, as may befal men exerciſing a good conſcience, manifeſting it in their converſation, and holding the foundation, not diſturbing others in their ways or worſhip that differ from them; there is no warrant for the Magiſtrate under the Goſpel to abridge them of their liberty.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. It is the duty of people to pray for Magiſtrates, to honor their perſons, to pay them Tribute and other dues, to obey their lawful commands, and to be ſubject to their Authority for conſcience ſake. Infidelity, or difference in Religion, doth not make void the Magiſtrates juſt and legal Authority, nor free the people from their obedience to him: from which, eccleſiaſtical perſons are not exempted, much leſſe hath the Pope any power or juriſdiction over them in their dominions, or over any of their people, and leaſt of all to deprive them of their dominions, or lives, if he ſhall judge them to be Hereticks, or upon any other pretence whatſoever.</p>

               <p n="2">II. Marriage was ordained for the mutual help of husband and wife, for the increaſe of mankind with a legitimate iſſue, and of the Church with an holy ſeed, and for preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of uncleanneſs.</p>

III.

               <p>SAcraments are holy Signs and Seals of the Covenant of Grace, immediately inſtituted by Chriſt, to repreſent him and his benefits, and to confirm our intereſt in him, and ſolemnly to engage us to the ſervice of God in Chriſt, according to his Word.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXIX. Of Baptiſm.</head>
               <p>BAptiſm is a Sacrament of the New Teſtament, ordained by Jeſus Chriſt to be unto the party baptized a ſign and ſeal of the Covenant of Graee, of his ingraffing into Chriſt, of regeneration, of remiſſion of ſins, and of his giving up unto God through Jeſus Chriſt to walk in newneſſe of life; which Ordinance is by Chriſts own appointment to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in his Church untill the end of the world.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The outward Element to be uſed in this Ordinance, is Water, wherewith the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is to be baptized in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt, by a Miniſter of the Goſpel lawfully called.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Dipping of the perſon into the water is not neceſſary; but Baptiſm is rightly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred by pouring or ſprinkling water upon the perſon.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Not onely thoſe that do actually profeſſe faith in, and obedience unto Chriſt, but alſo the Infants of one or both believing Parents are to be baptized, and thoſe onely.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Although it be a great ſin to contemn or neglect this Ordinance, yet grace and ſalvation are not ſo inſeparably annexed unto it, as that no perſon can be regenerated or ſaved without it; or that all that are baptized, are undoubtedly regenerated.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXX. Of the Lords Supper.</head>
               <p>Our Lord Jeſus in the night wherein he was betrayed, inſtituted the Sacrament of his Body and Blood, called the Lords Supper, to be obſerved in his Churches unto the end of the world, for the perpetual remembrance, and ſhewing forth of the Sacrifice of himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in his death, the ſealing of all benefits thereof unto true believers, their ſpiritual nouriſhment, and growth in him, their further ingagement in and to all duties which they owe unto him, and to be a bond and pledge of their communion with him, and with each other.</p>
               <p n="2">II. In this Sacrament Chriſt is not offered up to his Father, nor any reall Sacrifice made at all for remiſſion of the ſins of the quick or dead, but onely a memorial of that one offering up of himſelf by himſelf upon the Croſſe once for all, and a ſpiritual Oblation of all
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:115309:19"/>
poſſible praiſe unto God for the ſame; ſo that the Popiſh Sacrifice of the Maſs (as they call it) is moſt abominable, injurious to Chriſts own onely Sacrifice, the alone propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for all the ſins of the Elect.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The Lord Jeſus hath in this Ordinance appointed his Miniſters to pray and bleſſe the Elements of Bread and Wine, and thereby to ſet them apart from a common to an holy uſe, and to take and break the Bread, to take the Cup, and (they communicating alſo themſelves) to give both to the Communicants, but to none who are not then preſent in the Congregation.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Private Maſſes, or receiving the Sacrament by a Prieſt, or any other alone, as likewiſe the denial of the Cup to the people, worſhipping the Elements, the lifting them up, or carrying them about for adoration, and the reſerving them for any pretended religious uſe, are all contrary to the nature of this Sacrament, and to the Inſtitution of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="5">V. The outward Elements in this Sacrament duly ſet apart to the uſes ordained by Chriſt, have ſuch relation to him Crucified, as that truly, yet Sacramentally onely, they are ſometimes called by the name of the things they repreſent, to wit, the Body and Blood of Chriſt; albeit in ſubſtance and nature they ſtill remain truly and onely Bread and Wine as they were before.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. That Doctrine which maintains a change of the ſubſtance of Bread and Wine into the ſubſtance of Chriſts Body and Blood (commonly called Tranſubſtantiation) by conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Prieſt, or by any other way, is repugnant not to Scripture alone, but even to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe and reaſon, overthroweth the nature of the Sacrament, and hath been, and is, the cauſe of manifold Superſtitions, yea of groſs Idolatries.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Worthy Receivers outwardly partaking of the viſible Elements in this Sacrament, do then alſo inwardly by Faith, really and indeed, yet not carnally and corporally, but ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually, receive and feed upon Chriſt crucified, and all benefits of his death; the Body and Blood of Chriſt being then not corporally or carnally in, with, or under the Bread or Wine; yet as really, but ſpiritually preſent to the Faith of Believers in that Ordinance, as the Elements themſelves are to their outward ſenſes.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. All ignorant and ungodly perſons, as they are unfit to enjoy communion with Chriſt, ſo are they unworthy of the Lords Table, and cannot without great ſin againſt him, whileſt they remain ſuch, partake of theſe holy Myſteries, or be admitted thereunto; yea, whoſoever ſhall receive unworthily, are guilty of the Body and Blood of the Lord, eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drinking Judgement to themſelves.</p>

A particular Church gathered and compleated according to the minde of Chriſt, conſiſts of Officers and Members: The Lord Chriſt having given to his called ones (united according to his appointment in Church-order) Liberty and Power to chooſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons fitted by the Holy Ghoſt for that purpoſe, to be over them, and to miniſter to them in the Lord.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. The Members of theſe Churches are Saints by Calling, viſibly manifeſting and evidencing (in and by their profeſſion and walking) their Obedience unto that Call of Chriſt, who being further known to each other by their confeſſion of the Faith wrought in them by the power of God, declared by themſelves, or otherwiſe manifeſted, do willingly conſent to walk together, according to the appointment of Chriſt, giving up themſelves to the Lord, and to one another by the Will of God, in profeſſed ſubjection to the Ordinances of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. The Officers appointed by Chriſt to be choſen and ſet apart by the Church ſo called, and gathered for the peculiar adminiſtration of Ordinances, and execution of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer or Duty which he intruſts them with, or calls them to, to be continued to the end of the World, are Paſtors, Teachers, Elders and Deacons.</p>
            <p n="10">X. Churches thus gathered and aſſembling for the Worſhip of GOD<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are thereby viſible and publique, and their Aſſemblies (in what place ſoever they are, according as they have liberty or opportunity) are therefore Church or Publique Aſſemblies.</p>
            <p n="11">XI. The way appointed by Chriſt for the calling of any perſon, fitted and gifted by the Holy Ghoſt, unto the Office of Paſtor, Teacher, or Elder, in a Church, is, that he be choſen thereunto by the common ſuffrage of the Church it ſelf, and ſolemnly ſet apart by Faſting and Prayer, with Impoſition of Hands of the Elderſhip of that Church, if there be any before conſtituted therein: And of a Deacon, that he be choſen by the like ſuffrage, and ſet apart by Prayer, and the like Impoſition of Hands.</p>
            <p n="12">XII. The Eſſence of this Call of a Paſtor, Teacher, or Elder unto Office, conſiſts in the Election of the Church, together with his acceptation of it, and ſeparation by Faſting and Prayer: And theſe who are ſo choſen, though not ſet apart by Impoſition of Hands, are rightly conſtituted Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt, in whoſe Name and Authority they exerciſe the Miniſtery to them ſo committed. The Calling of Deacons conſiſteth in the like Election and acceptation, with ſeparation by Prayer.</p>
            <p n="13">XIII. Although it be incumbent on the Paſtors and Teachers of the Churches to be inſtant in Preaching the Word, by way of Office; yet the work of Preaching the Word is not ſo peculiarly confined to them, but that others alſo gifted and fitted by the Holy Ghoſt for it, and approved (being by lawful ways and means in the Providence of God cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led thereunto) may publiquely, ordinarily, and conſtantly perform it; ſo that they give themſelves up thereunto,</p>
            <p n="14">
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:115309:21"/>
XIV. However, they who are ingaged in the work of Publique Preaching, and enjoy the Publique Maintenance upon that account, are not thereby obliged to diſpenſe the Seals to any other then ſuch as (being Saints by Calling, and gathered according to the Order of the Goſpel) they ſtand related to, as Paſtors or Teachers; yet ought they not to neglect others living within their Parochial Bounds, but beſides their conſtant publique Preaching to them, they ought to enquire after their profitting by the Word, inſtructing them in, and preſſing upon them (whether young or old) the great Doctrines of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, even perſonally, and particularly, ſo far as their ſterngth and time will admit.</p>
            <p n="15">XV. Ordination alone without the Election or precedent conſent of the Church, by thoſe who formerly have been Ordained by vertue of that Power they have received by their Ordination, doth not conſtitute any perſon a Church-Officer, or communicate Office-power unto him.</p>
            <p n="16">XVI. A Church furniſhed with Officers (according to the mind of Chriſt) hath full power to adminiſter all his Ordinances; and where there is want of any one or more Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers required, that Officer, or thoſe which are in the Church, may adminiſter all the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances proper to their particular Duty and Offices; but where there are no Teaching Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, none may adminiſter the Seals, nor can the Church authorize any ſo to do.</p>
            <p n="17">XVII. In the carrying on of Church-adminiſtrations, no perſon ought to be added to the Church, but by the conſent of the Church it ſelf; that ſo love (without diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) may be preſerved between all the Members thereof.</p>
            <p n="18">XVIII. Whereas the Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath appointed and inſtituted as a means of Edification, that thoſe who walk not according to the Rules and Laws appointed by him (in reſpect of Faith and Life, ſo that juſt offence doth ariſe to the Church thereby) be cenſured in his Name and Authority: Every Church hath power it it ſelf to exerciſe and execute all thoſe Cenſures appointed by him, in the way and Order preſcribed in the Goſpel.</p>
            <p n="19">XIX. The Cenſures ſo appointed by Chriſt, are Admonition and Excommunication: and whereas ſome offences are or may be known onely to ſome, it is appointed by Chriſt, that thoſe to whom they are ſo known, do fi ſt admoniſh the offender in private; (in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique offences where any ſin, before all) and in caſe of non-amendment upon private admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, the offence being related to the Church, and the offender not manifeſting his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, he is to be duly admoniſhed in the Name of Chriſt by the whole Church, by the Miniſtery of the Elders of the Church; and if this Cenſure prevail not for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, then he is to be caſt out by Excommun cation with the conſent of the Church.</p>
            <p n="20">XX. As all Believers are bound to joyn themſelves to particular Churches, when and where they have opportunity ſo to do; ſo none are to be admitted unto the Priviledges of the Churches, who do not ſubmit themſelves to the Rule of Chriſt in the Cenſures for the Government of them.</p>
            <p n="21">XXI. This being the way preſcribed by Chriſt in caſe of offence, no Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers upon any offences taken by them, having performed their duty required of them in
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:115309:22"/>
this matter, ought to diſturb any Church-order, or abſent themſelves from the publique Aſſemblies, or the Adminiſtrat on of any Ordinances upon that pretence, butto wait upon Chriſt in the further proceeding of the Church.</p>
            <p n="22">XXII. The Power of Cenſures being ſeating by Chriſt in a particular Church, is to be exerciſed onely towards particular members of each Church reſpectively as ſuch; and there is no power given by him unto any Synods or Eccleſiaſtical Aſſemblies to Excommunicate, or by their publique Edicts to threaten Excommunication, or other Church cenſures againſt Churches, Magiſtrates, or their people upon any account, no man being obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to that Cenſure, but upon his perſonal miſcarriage, as a Member of a particular Church.</p>
            <p n="23">XXIII. Although the Church is a Society of men, aſſembling for the celebration of the Ordinances according to the appointment of Chriſt, yet every Society aſſembling for that end or purpoſe, upon the account of cohabitation within any civil Precincts or Bounds is not thereby conſtituted a Church, ſeeing there may be wanting among them, what is eſſentially required thereunto; and therefore a Believer living with others in ſuch a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinct, may joyn himſelf with any Church for his edification.</p>
            <p n="24">XXIV. For the avoiding of differences that may otherwiſe ariſe, for the greater So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity in the Celebration of the Ordinances of Chriſt, and the opening a way for the larger uſefulneſs of the Gifts and Graces of the Holy Ghoſt; Saints living in one City or Town, or within ſuch diſtances as that they may conveniently aſſemble for divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, ought rather to joyn in one Church for their mutual ſtrengthening and edification, then to ſet up many diſtinct Societies.</p>
            <p n="25">XXV. As all Churches, and all the members of them are bound to pray continually for the good or proſperity of all the Churches of Chriſt in all places, and upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, to further it; (Every one within the bounds of their Places and Callings, in the exerciſe of their Gifts and Graces): So the Churches themſelves (when planted by the providence of God, ſo as they may have opportunity and advantage for it) ought to hold communion amongſt themſelves for their peace, increaſe of love, and mutual edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
            <p n="26">XXVI. In Caſes of Difficulties or Differences, either in point of Doctrine or in Adminiſtrations, wherein either the Churches in general are concerned, or any one Church in their Peace, Union, and Edification, or any Member or Members of any Church are injured in, or by, any proceeding in Cenſures not agreeable to Truth and Order: it is according to the mind of Chriſt, that many Churches holding communion together, do by their Meſſengers meet in a Synod or Council, to conſider and give their advice in, or about, that matter in difference, to be reported to all the Churches concerned: Howbeit, theſe Synods ſo aſſembled are not entruſted with any Church-Power, properly ſo called, or with any Juriſdiction over the Churches themſelves, to exerciſe any Cenſures, either over any Churches or Perſons, or to impoſe their determinations on the Churches or Officers.</p>
            <p n="27">XXVII. Beſides theſe occaſioned Synods or Councels, there are not inſtituted by Chriſt any ſtated Synods in a fixed Combination of Churches, or their Officers, in leſſer or grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Aſſemblies; nor are there any Synods appointed by Chriſt in a way of Subordination to one another.</p>
            <p n="28">
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:115309:22"/>
XXVIII. Perſons that are joyned in Church-fellowſhip, ought not lightly or without juſt cauſe to withdraw themſelves from the communion of the Church whereunto they are ſo joyned: Nevertheleſs, where any perſon cannot continue in any Church without his ſin, either for want of the Adminiſtration of any Ordinances inſtituted by Chriſt, or by his being deprived of his due Priviledges, or compelled to any thing in practice not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by the Word, or in caſe of Perſecution, or upon the account of conveniency of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation; he, conſulting with the Church, or the Officer or Officers thereof, may peaceably depart from the communion of the Church, wherewith he hath ſo walked, to joyn him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with ſome other Church, where he may enjoy the Ordinances in the purity of the ſame, for his edification and conſolation.</p>
            <p n="29">XXIX. Such reforming Churches as conſiſt of Perſons ſound in the Faith, and of Converſation becoming the Goſpel, ought not to refuſe the communion of each other, ſo far as may conſiſt with their own Principles reſpectively, though they walk not in all things according to the ſame Rules of Church-Order.</p>
            <p n="30">XXX. Churches gathered and walking according to the mind of Chriſt, judging other Churches (though leſs pure) to be true Churches, may receive, unto occaſional com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with them, ſuch Members of thoſe Churches as are credibly teſtified to be godly, and to live without offence.</p>
