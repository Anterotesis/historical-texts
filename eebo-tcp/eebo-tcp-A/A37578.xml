         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Where this holy Servant of God, sheweth plainly that all whatsoever the Holy Fathers looked for, which God sware he would grant and give unto them, and their seed; to save and deliver them from their enemies, and from the hand of all that hated them, to serve him without feare in holinesse &amp;c.

               <p>And according to that of <hi>Zecharias</hi> and all the rest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, doth the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> give testimonie, speaking to the Iewes of Christ also the true deliverer: whom they had crucified, and was now ascended into Heaven, saying vnto them, <hi>Repent ye therefore and bee converted, that your sinnes may bee blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall

                  </gap>nswer is, in breefe this; First, they are utterly mistaken in the word Soules, because they wil have it to intend bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as well as soules; for although sometimes in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture soules only are named, when both bodies and soules are meant, as in <hi>Gen</hi> 46.15. and so the 27. verse, where it is said, All the Soules of the House of <hi>Iacob</hi> which came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Egypt,</hi> were three score and ten; yet I say it cannot be so meant here: my reasons are, first, These soules which Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, he saw, are the soules of men be headed, and not of living men; but if yee say <hi>Iohn</hi> foresaw them risen, and so names the soule for both, my answer is, This cannot be, the soule may not be named for the body, nor with the body in this case, as to meane both; because the soule of a regenerate man being now alive by faith, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be said either to dye with the body, or to rise with the body, neither is there any resurrection of the soule after the death of the body, &amp; therefore may not be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for the death of the body, nor for the resurrection of the body, neither is there such an instance in all the Scriptures, as to say whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a righteous mans body dieth or is dead, there is a soule dead, although it may be so said of an ungodly man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And now let me a little advise the Reader (whosoever

And Christ sheweth plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the fruit whereby his faithfull shall know the true Prophets and the false, is their words, which proceede from the good, or from the evill treasure of the heart, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And what doth now so prove unto the faithfull, the goodnesse of the Prophets and Apostles as their words?</p>
               <p>And secondly, my advice unto the Reade is, that hee would himselfe betake him to the diligent search and studie of the Scriptures, with earnest desire, and humble request unto God in his heart, to guide and instruct him by his holy Spirit unto the understanding of the same. For without all doubt, the holy Scriptures of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apostles are the most sure, and clearest Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of the truth and waies of eternall life, that are to be
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:97756:23"/>
found in the world, and such as we may be sure off, will not deceive us: And let the Reader take heede that his trust or dependance bee not on any man whatsoever, though he be never so high in esteeme, or take never so much upon him.</p>
               <p>And this I say further unto him for his comfort and incouragement whatsoever he bee, if hee can preferre wisedome and understanding in his heart, before all things in the world, I meane the true wisedome which is from above, and shall with his whole soule desire and seeke it at the hands of God, hee shall assuredly attaine unto it, let him not doubt, for so sure as the Lord God which promiseth, will not faile of his word, if he can, and shall so preferre it. So seeke it, he shall have it.</p>
               <p>Let him not harken or give heede unto any, that shall say, it is not for you to search the Scriptures, and studie them so, you are unlearned &amp; cannot understand them, you have not the tongues, wherin they were written, &amp;c. As if God had promised and tyed the understanding of his word and Gospel of Salvation to those and such like common gifts, which men may abound with and perish. Nay, take heede of these, for they speake not the words of wisedome unto you, but of falsehood and deceit. If they did understand in their heart what true wisedome is, and from whence it commeth, they would not so speake, but would know that God is the instructer, and free giver of this wisedome: to the learned, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned without respect of persons. And that hee hath often times confounded the wisedome of the wise and mighty of the world by weake and despised things, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> declareth, proving it from the Prophet <hi>Esay,</hi> saying, <hi>For it is written, I will destroy the wisedome of the wise, and bring to nought the undeestanding of the prudent: Where is the wise, where is the Scribe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was learned, yet these are his sayings: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though peradventure some dare be so bold as to say, they are now out of daet, because they would have it so to be conceived of the people, to the end they should not seeke understanding from the Scriptures, but depend upon them for instruction, and have them in admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as hath beene the policy and practise a long time, of them of the Church of Rome, to keepe the people from the Scriptures, that they might remaine in ignorance, and exalt them in their mindes, and honour them as Gods Prophets, and their words of errour and deceit, as Gods oracles. Take heede of such I say, for although they doe not like to have any to bee Lords over them in such respects, yet they, by this, shew plainly, that they would be Lords over you.</p>
               <p>But howsoever, the Lord saith to the humble in heart, that he will teach them his waies, &amp; that his secrets are with them that feare him, and that hee will dwell with him that is of an humble and contrite heart. And Christ saith, <hi>Aske and ye shall have, seeke and ye shall finde, knocke and it shall be opened unto you:</hi> Nay more, <hi>Behold I stand at the doore and knocke, if any man open the doore I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and hee with me.</hi> Rev. 3.20.

To be so in account with God, that made heaven and earth, and beloved of him, and to know it to be so, as all the holy Fathers, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Saints have done, there is no comparison.</p>
               <p>And all this out of doubt, is to bee attained, God is still the same, he can make knowne his love and his waies now, as well as heretofore: and the time is now come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, and incoming, wherein he will doe it more abunda<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
