            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

more dangerous then the Scribes &amp; Phariſees: None more
malicious, becauſe none did ſo clearely apprehend the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of Chriſt, as they that ſaw the rayes of his divinity
ſhining in his miracles, the evidence of his acquaintance
with God in his divine doctrine; yet they hated him extreamely as
ſhadowing and eclipſing their repute, and power with the people,
whoſe praiſe they ſought more then the praiſe of God: Now as no
poyſon is ſtronger then that of the hotteſt Countries, ſo no malice
greater then that of the moſt enlightned breaſts; Nor any more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
becauſe none covered their enmity with ſuch ſhewes of gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and devotion as they did, whereby their example and perſwaſions
tooke with many to the great hinderance of the efficacy of Chriſts
Preaching: For formall hypocriſie is more miſchievous to mens ſoules,
then open ungodlineſſe, in as much as it is leſſe diſcernible, even as a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
lurking under greene leaves is more dangerous, then a dogge that
runnes on a man with open mouth. <hi>Fallit vitium ſpecie virtutis et um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra:</hi>
which thing cauſed our Lord Chriſt to have more encounters
with this generation of vipers, then with all other adverſaries.
Among which, that which is related in this Chapter is remarkeable:
For it may ſeeme that they came downe from Jeruſalem of purpoſe to
quarrell with Chriſt, and therefore our Saviour deales with them moſt
plainely and ſharpely in his reply.</p>
            <p>The occaſion they take was his diſciples omiſſion of their antient
Cuſtome of waſhing afore meales, the neglect of which they conceived a
great crime, as violating the tradition of the Elders: Concerning
which they expoſtulate with Chriſt for his diſciples ſuppoſed fault:
<hi>v.</hi> 2. Why doe thy diſciples tranſgreſſe the tradition of the Elders?
Had the people of this generation beene to make anſwer to this queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they would have fallen on Chriſts diſciples, and checked them for
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:155274:4"/>
their indiſcretion at leaſt in giving offence in a matter indifferent, of
novelty in not obſerving old cuſtomes. They ſhould have heard, What
harme is it to waſh ones hands before meales? why ſhould not men
for peace ſake doe as others doe? Are you wiſer then the <hi>Rabbines?</hi>
then your Elders? will you be ſingular and different from all others?
Smooth words ſhould have beene given to the Phariſees, to entreat
them to be contented, order ſhould be taken to teach the diſciples bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
manners; But our Saviour carries the buſineſſe in another way,
what his diſciples neglected to doe, he himſelfe gave them example to
neglect, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. 38. And when the Phariſees excepted againſt them,
he doth in plaine words endite them of hypocriſie, and chargeth them
home by a proofe from the Prophet <hi>Eſaias,</hi> which he applies to them
as foreſpoken of them.<note place="margin">Sect. 2.</note> 
               <hi>verſ.</hi> 7, 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 9.</p>
            <p>So that the words of my text are a paſſage cited out of the propheſie
of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 29. 13. wherein our Saviour makes uſe of the Septuagints
tranſlation, which is ſomewhat different in words, though not in
ſenſe, from the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> for whereas in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> the words are, <hi>And
their feare towards me is taught from,</hi> or <hi>by the precepts of men,</hi> the
Septuagint reade, <hi>But in vaine doe they worſhip me, teaching for doctrines
the Commandements of men.</hi> In which there is a ſinne charged upon
theſe Phariſes, to wit, the teaching doctrines the commandements
of men, that is, as <hi>Piſcator</hi> in his <hi>Scholies</hi> paraphraſeth the words, <hi>tales
doctrinas, quae nihil aliud ſunt quam mandata hominum,</hi> ſuch doctrines
as are nothing elſe but mens commandements, which being taught by
thoſe that were to be teachers of the law, and ſeemed to be ſuch in
ſtead of Gods precepts, were therefore accounted as Gods worſhip, or
his feare. 2. There is a cenſure paſſed on this practice <hi>[In vaine doe they
worſhip me]</hi> which words are not in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> yet may be collected
from the woe threatned to ſuch teachers, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29. 14. whereby God
diſclaimes ſuch teaching and practice as being no ſervice of his, though
the teachers and practiſers of ſuch Commands of men, imagined they
honored God thereby. So that the plaine truth that this enunciation
of our Lord Chriſt affords is this: That however they thinke of
their actions they doe is vaine worſhip God, who teach for doctrines
mens precepts. The ſelfe ſame truth is ſeconded by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who in
his Epiſtle to the <hi>Colaſſians ch. 2. v.</hi> 20, 21, 23. ſpeakes thus; why as
though living in the world are ye ſubject to ordinances; after the
commandements and doctrines of men? which things have indeed a
ſhew of wiſedome in will-worſhip. In which you may clearely ſee that
the Apoſtle condemnes dogmatizing, that is, either teaching<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> urging, or
ſubmitting to <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:155274:4"/>
14. <hi>Epheſ. 2. 15. Luk.</hi> 2. 1. which are after the commandements and
doctrines of men, which he ſayes have a ſhew of wiſedome in wil-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
which hath no true wiſedome, nor pleaſeth God.</p>
            <p>That I may the more clearely and fully open the truth in this point,<note place="margin">Sect. 3.</note>
I ſhall diſtinctly endeavour to declare, what theſe doctrines comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements
of men were, and how the Phariſees taught them. 2. How
they did worſhip God in vaine. 3. Why they did in vaine worſhip
God. Concerning the firſt of theſe, It is plaine that theſe Phariſees
and Scribes did many wayes teach contrary to the Law of God, to
wit, in expounding the lawes of God as if they did onely prohibit the
groſſe externall act, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 21, 27, 33, 38, 43. they urged the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
matters of the law, as tithing of mint, and neglected the greater,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 23. But in this place that which our Saviour objects to them
is that they ſought to eſtabliſh the traditions of men, though Gods
commands were thereby rejected, or neglected. Particularly that a
man was not to regard the honouring of his father and mother, if he
had taken on him the raſh and impious vow of <hi>Corban,</hi> which was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
<hi>contra legem,</hi> againſt the law, to allow men for an unjuſt oathes
ſake to breake Gods plaine precept. But chiefely that they taught
men to obſerve things <hi>praeter legem,</hi> beſides the law, inſtead of Gods
law, as the waſhing hands afore meales, the waſhing of cups and pots,
brazen veſſells and tables, with many ſuch like traditions invented by
men: Theſe things they ſtrictly urged on the people, excepting much
at the omiſſion of them, conniving at, yea countenancing the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion
of God precepts: They aſcribed ſo much authority to the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of the Elders that they made it a great crime to tranſgreſſe them;
they conceived and taught that the not obſerving of them made men
unholy and uncleane, elſe they would not have been offended with
Chriſt, when he taught that the eating with unwaſhen hands defileth
not a man; they conceived their obſervation of them did pleaſe God
as if he were thereby honoured.</p>
            <p>Now this teaching for doctrines mens precepts is worſhipping God
in vaine,<note place="margin">Sect. 4.</note> becauſe it doth not pleaſe God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fruſta fit quod non attingit finem,</hi> That is done in vaine which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
not its end, wherefore ſith ſuch commandements of men are
obſerved that God may be pleaſed, and God is not thereby pleaſed,
they muſt needes be in vaine. And indeed God is not pleaſed with
ſuch ſervice, ſith he counts it no ſervice to him, yea he is much diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with it, as appeares by the threatning, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29. 14. Becauſe their feare
towards me is taught by the precepts of men, therefore behold I will
proceede to doe a marvellous worke among this people, even a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailous
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:155274:5"/>
worke and a wonder, for the wiſedome of their wiſe men ſhall
periſh, and the underſtanding of their prudent men ſhall be hid. All
which came to paſſe when the Phariſees and Scribes who were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
the onely <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or wiſe men, Doctors of the Lawes, Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins
and Maſters in Iſrael, by reaſon of their placing religion in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of men, waſhings, long robes, phylacteries and ſuch like,
were delivered over to ſuch blindneſſe and ſottiſhneſſe of ſpirit as to be
ignorant of their Meſſiah, and his Kingdome, the true righteouſneſſe
of the Goſpell, ſpirituall new-birth, and other heavenly truths of
Gods profound Counſell in Chriſt. A moſt heavy, but moſt juſt
judgement of God, that like as when the heathens knowing God by
his workes they held the truth in unrighteouſneſſe, ſo theſe knowing
him by his law, but loving unrighteouſneſſe, ſhould become vaine in
their imaginations, and their fooliſh heart be darkened, profeſſing
themſelves to be wiſe they ſhould become fooles, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 21, 22. For
what more fooliſh then to thinke that the onely wiſe God who is an
immortall Spirit ſhould be pleaſed with ſuch toyes, as waſhings, phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacteries
and ſuch like obſervances, when there is no Philoſopher that
is given to contemplation, but thinkes ſuch things to be rather babies
for children to play with, then bookes for men to reade?</p>
            <p>Of this cenſure and judgement there may be many reaſons given.<note place="margin">Sect. 5.</note> As
firſt, It is vaine to worſhip or to thinke to pleaſe God by the doctrines
which are Commandements of men: for God is not pleaſed with mans
devices, what is deviſed by man comes from a corrupt and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
heart, and ſuch a corrupt fountaine muſt needs ſend forth but
puddle water. And this is true of the beſt of men in the things of
God: <hi>The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wiſe that they are vaine,</hi> 1 Cor.
3. 20. Whence the Apoſtle, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 23. when he ſpeakes of the things
deviſed by men who introduced <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a wil-worſhip, ſayes
of them that they had a ſhew of wiſedome, they ſeemed to be wiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions
to beget reverence to God, and humility in mens ſpirits, but
it was farre otherwiſe in truth. For as children doe count many
things wiſe which underſtanding men doe laugh at: ſo carnall hearts
of men eſteemed as wiſe among men doe count many things to be
wiſe, as duckings, bowings, waſhings, whippings, creepings, pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimages,
and ſuch like geſtures, uſages, and rites invented by men to
expreſſe humility, devotion and reverence to God, which the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
who is a moſt holy Spirit, contemnes as childiſh, apiſh, theatrical and
ridiculous: Beſides; we may conſider the vanity of ſuch inventions for
Gods worſhip by the event. For whereas many things have beene in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
and uſed by men out of a ſuppoſed good intent to further devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:155274:5"/>
experience hath ſufficiently proved that they have corrupted the
Church with ſuperſtition and Idolatry.</p>
            <p>Thus Images thought fit by <hi>Gregory</hi> to bee made Laymens bookes
became in time Laymens and Clergy mens, Gods too, the ſigne of the
Croſſe invented to teſtifie their faith in Chriſt before heathens, became
the object of faith and adoration inſtead of Chriſt among Chriſtians,
the praying at the Tombes of Martyrs proceeded to the invocation
of Martyrs, monaſticall orders and vowes highly commended for the
promoting of chaſtity and piety became the chiefeſt meanes to further
ſuperſtition, ignorance, ſenſuality and uncleanneſſe, that ever the
devill invented: The like might be ſaid of reſerving the Euchariſt,
keeping of feſtivals, of faſting dayes, preſerving of reliques, pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages,
and innumerable other devices, which in proceſſe of time,
though at firſt invented for a good uſe, turned to the great detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of religion, and corrupting of the Goſpell: I thinke an inſtance
cannot be given of a device of man pretending to advance piety, and
to edifie the Church, when God hath provided other meanes to that
end, which hath not in the concluſion hindered piety; and more or
leſſe, deſtroyed the purity of Religion. So ſottiſh and blinde is the
wiſedome of man in appointing and directing the ſervice of
God.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Sect. 6.</note> in vaine is Gods feare taught by mens precepts, becauſe
God is not pleaſed with Carnall obſervances and bodily exerciſes:
Bodily exerciſe, ſaith the Apoſtle 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8. profiteth little, but god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe
is profitable to all things, where the Apoſtle oppoſeth godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to bodily exerciſe, and thereby ſheweth that bodily exerciſe is
not godlineſſe, and therefore profits but a little, to wit among men,
getting eſteeme with them, but nothing with God, whoſe promiſes
onely are made to true Godlineſſe which is a ſpirituall exerciſe. For
God is a Spirit, and they that worſhip him, muſt worſhip him in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
and in truth, ſaith our Saviour, <hi>John.</hi> 4. 23, 24. Now mens pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
are altogether about bodily things, as waſhings, geſtures, gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
faſtings, feaſtings, proceſſions, buildings, and ſuch like; All
which reach no further then the body, cannot rectifie or amend the
Soule: and make it more like to God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Sect. 7.</note> this teaching for doctrines mens precepts diſpleaſeth God,
as being injurious to him, and that in a double reſpect: firſt, teaching
and urging mens commands in ſtead of doctrines, whereby Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
ſhould be taught, intrencheth on Gods Prerogative, who is the
onely Lawgiver to his Church, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 12. for his worſhip. For as it
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:155274:6"/>
is a prerogative of a King to appoint the wayes of his owne ſervice
and honour, and he ſhould be taken to be very preſumptuous and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogant
that ſhould take upon him to preſcribe a faſhion of attendance,
ſuite, and ſervice to his Prince without his conſent, when he hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
declared his will; ſo is it much more intolerable pride, and
preſumption in a mortall man, to appoint a way of ſervice to God,
which he never conſented to, but hath otherwiſe directed his owne
ſervice. And for the ſame reaſon it is a transferring of Gods prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
on a man, when he doth ſervilly conſent by ſubjecting his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
to ſuch uſurpation. Secondly, God is injured by the thoughts
that ſuch ſuperſtitious perſons have of God, when they conceive
God to be ſuch a one as will be pleaſed with humane Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
to be ſo childiſh or ſimple as to be affected with pompes,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sir</hi> Fran. Bacons eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayes of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition.</note> and
ſhewes, and geſtures, and carnall rites, which he never appointed. I
remember the ſaying of a man of great wit to this effect:
That ſuperſtition alike injures God, as Atheiſme. For as <hi>Plutarch</hi>
ſayes, I had as liefe men ſhould ſay there is no ſuch man as <hi>Plutarch,</hi>
as to ſay <hi>Plutarch</hi> is a foole; ſo ſaith the Author it is as injurious to
God to ſay he is ſo childiſh, as to be taken with ſuperſtition, as to deny
his being.</p>
            <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Sect. 8.</note> this teaching for doctrines mens precepts produceth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other evill effects. Firſt, it oppoſeth Gods word, his Law, his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
ſundry wayes. Firſt, Becauſe it brings in another rule of worſhip
then Gods Law, to wit tradition of Elders, cuſtome, example, or
opinion of ſeeming grave, wiſe and pious men, of affected teachers.
For theſe are the rules by which ſuperſtitious perſons are guided, not
by Gods word. Now it is a high crime againſt God to follow any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
rule of our worſhip and obedience to him, ſith he hath injoyned
<hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 2. Ye ſhall not adde unto the word which I command you,
neither ſhall you diminiſh ought from it, that ye may keepe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements
of the Lord your God, which I command you. <hi>Prov.</hi>
30. 6. <hi>Adde not thou unto his words, leſt he reprove thee and thou bee found
a lier.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Becauſe it oppoſeth the manifeſtation of the cleare light
of the Goſpell. As ſhadowes darken the light of the Sunne that ſhines
in the aire, ſo carnall rites invented by men obſcure the ſpirituall
beauty, and ſplendour of the Goſpell, ſo that by reaſon of ſuch rites
the Goſpell is either not conſidered, or underſtood carnally: Thus
the Ceremonies of <hi>Moſes</hi> law were as a vaile before the eyes of the
Jewes, that they could not looke to the end of that which is aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:155274:6"/>
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 13. And the popiſh ceremonies darkned the true light of
the Goſpell. And let any man looke into thoſe places in which there
is ſo much preaching of ceremonies, and Church orders, and ſuch a
regular obſervation of them, as in places where the Cathedrall and
Canonicall Preachers, and officiating Prieſts doe beare ſway, he ſhall
finde little ſpirituall underſtanding, and lively feeling of the doctrine
and grace of Chriſt; the higheſt pitch that they bring men to, (and
there are but few that are brought by them ſo farre) is ſome morall
civility, ſome outward regularity in the outward formes of devotion,
which yet is accompanyed, as it was in the Phariſees, with bitter
and virulent enmity againſt holy and ardent zeale for Chriſt, and
ſhewes it ſelfe to be but Phariſaicall hypocriſie when it is brought to
triall. It is uſually alledged that ſuch Ceremonies are appointed for
edification, and that the text 1 <hi>Cor. 14. 26. Let all things be done unto
edifying,</hi> allowes men, ſpecially Prelates in a Synod, to ordaine what
they conceive may be for edifying. But the occaſion of theſe words
plainly ſhewes that the Apoſtle meanes not every arbitrary deviſe which
is conceited by men, though the wiſeſt, moſt grave and pious, to bee
for edifying, muſt be done, for then the text would impoſe a neceſſity of
ſubjection to ſuch humane devices. But the text is plainly meant of ſuch
things as are neceſſary to edification, as ſpeaking in a knowne tongue,
and without confuſion. And although I know Ceremonies invented
by men are pretented to ſerve for edification, yet I muſt profeſſe
that I never found in my reading, or experience, that ever any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
by ſuch rites, or obſervances was wonne to the profeſſion of
Chriſt, or brought to any ſpirituall knowledge of Chriſt, any true
faith or ſincere obedience to him. Poſſibly they may beget ſome kinde
of raptures of carnall delight, through melodious ſoundes or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
ſights, ſome kinde of womaniſh pity, and teares, ſuch as the
acting of a ſtage play will draw from ſome perſons: but that ever
they begat ſanctifying knowledge, ſound repentance, holy mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of ſinne, lively faith, fruitfull living to God, I aſſure my
ſelfe cannot be ſhewed: But it is certaine on the contrary that the
teaching for doctrines commandements of men hath occaſioned men
to oppoſe the principall point of the Goſpell of Chri<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t, to wit, juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
by faith in him, and contrary to the covenant of grace in
Chriſt to conceive a righteouſneſſe in themſelves by the obſervation
of mens commands, as in the Phariſees and Papiſts, and al ſorts of
ſuperſtitious perſons it doth abundantly appeare.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, becauſe the teachers of precepts of men for doctrines doe
ſtill oppoſe the fruitfull and faithfull Preaching of Gods word. Thus
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:155274:7"/>
it was in the Phariſees, thus in Papiſts, and thus it appeares ſtill by
experience. They that urge or affect humane religious rites are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected
and adverſaries to Godly Preaching: where the one is ſet up,
the other goes downe. And this ſhewes a malignity in them when
they are ſo inconſiſtent with that, of which our Saviour ſaid, One
thing is neceſſary, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. 42. Even as weedes though never ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
to the eyes are judged to be hurtfull when they deſtroy good
Corne, which ſhould preſerve mens lives. And for this reaſon ſhould
be weeded out when they have this effect, what ever pretence of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
or eſteeme they have.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, It oppoſeth Gods word in that it introduceth an obedience,
which alwayes diminiſheth or annihilates the obedience due to Gods
Law: were there no more inſtances to prove this, then what we finde
of the Phariſees charged upon them by our Lord Chriſt, <hi>Mark.</hi> 7. 8.
that laying aſide the Commandement of God they held the tradition
of men, <hi>v.</hi> 9. ye reject the Commandement of God that ye may keep
your owne tradition, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. making the word of God of none effect
through your tradition, this were enough to make it appeare that as
<hi>Pharaohs</hi> leane kine devoured the fat ones, ſo this ſuperſtitious devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to mens precepts devoures the true obedience that is due to Gods
Commands: But it is alſo manifeſt that ſuch is the effect of obſerving
humane traditions by the practiſes of Papiſts, and ignorant ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
people in all Countries: For as for Papiſts it is notorious how
zealous they are for the traditions, as they call them, of the
Church,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dr.</hi> Hall quo vadis or cenſure of travaile.</note> but how careleſſe they are of Gods commands: I had rather
expreſſe it in the words of another then mine owne. What Papiſt in
all Chriſtendome hath ever beene heard to pray dayly with his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
or ſing but a Pſalme at home? Looke into the univerſall courſe of
the Catholike life,<note place="margin">Sect. 20.</note> there you ſhall finde the Decalogue profeſſedly
broken, beſides the ordinary practice of Idolatry, and frequency of
oathes: Who ever ſaw Gods day duely kept in any City, village or
houſhold under the Juriſdiction of <hi>Rome?</hi> Every obſcure holy day
takes the wall of it and thruſts it into the Channel: Who ſees not obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to authority ſo ſlighted, that it ſtands onely to the mercy of
humane diſpenſation? And in the reſt of Gods Lawes who ſees not
how foule ſins paſſe for veniall? and how eaſily veniall ſins paſſe their
ſatisfaction: for which a croſſe or drop of holy water is ſufficient
amends? Who ſees not how no place can be left for truth, where there
is full roome given to equivocation? And how true the like is of the
late prelaticall party, and their ſuperſtitious adherents, who have ſo
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:155274:7"/>
zealouſly and induſtriouſly promoted humane Ceremonies, it
is abundantly manifeſt, by their opening a gap for licentiouſneſſe
in prophaning the Lords day, by their diſcountenancing and ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the diligent preaching of Gods word, by their countenancing
drinking of healths, common ſwearing, gaming and other practiſes
of ſenſuality, either practiſing them or not reproving them, but ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
favourably of ſuch as uſe them, and by their continuall diſquieting
of thoſe that have ſought to promote the knowledge and worſhip of
God by praying in their families, repeating Gods word, and prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of God together, and chiefly by their devilliſh practiſes whereby
they endeavour to hinder the reformation of the ignorance, ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and prophaneneſſe that hath overſpread the Land by reaſon of
an unworthy miniſtery and corrupt diſcipline. And indeed this is
the genuine effect that followes this ſinne, that it makes men averſe
from, and negligent of Gods Commands. Saint <hi>Auguſtines</hi> obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in his 119. Epiſtle to <hi>Januarius</hi> of the men of his time is well
knowne, that thoſe who made conſcience to touch the ground with
their bare feete in their Octaves, made no ſcruple of conſcience to be
drunken. And the like is ſtill found true, that thoſe that are ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
to omit a Church order, an old tradition, an humane rite, ſcarſe
ever make ſcruple of being drunke; of officious, and jeſting lies, of
charming, or going to ſuch as ſay prayers to helpe Cattell, of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
people in riotous manner, of hearing and ſpreading lies of
Godly perſons, of faithfull preachers: but are rather ſo beſotted as
to thinke ſome of theſe to be good workes, or at leaſt that there is
no harme in them. In a word, there is ſuch a venome in this practice
of teaching and obſerving of doctrines mens precepts, that it
ſtrangeth the mindes of people and Miniſters from learning, and
ſtudying Gods word, and inclines them to heede and invent and be
led by tales and legends of lies framed to get credit to ſuperſtitious
uſages that have no ſtrength of them ſelves.</p>
            <p>Another evill effect by this ſinne is againſt Gods worſhip bringing
men to an hypocriticall image of devotion without life,<note place="margin">Sect. 9.</note> a forme of
godlineſſe without power: This might eaſily be verified by inſtancing
in the Phariſees and Papiſts praying and faſting, being but a meere ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
and ſhell of thoſe duties. And thus it is with thoſe people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
our ſelves that place their Religion in their rites, and thinke
they ſhall have a new Religion when any old cuſtome or rite is left;
they thinke they have kept a faſt well, if they have forborne eating,
though there have beene no examination of Conſcience, humiliation
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:155274:8"/>
of ſoule, or repentance from ſinne: they thinke they pray well if they
be preſent when the Service booke is read, and ſay after the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
though without knowledge, attention of minde, faith in Gods
promiſes, or fervency of deſire: they thinke they receive the Lords
ſupper well, if without any godly preparation, ſpirituall meditation,
they doe with empty ſtomacks and faire deportment eate the bread
and drinke the wine of ſolemne ſeaſons: they thinke they uſe baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
well, if they get ſome to ſtand at the font as ſureties, for the
Childs faith, (which I thinke to be proper to Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 22.) the
Childe to be ſprinckled with water, &amp; croſſed on the fore-head, though
there be no ſenſe of the guilt and defilement of ſinne, utter ignorance
of the excellency and neceſſity of ſpirituall new birth. And the like
is their carriage in hearing the word read and preached, in ſinging of
Pſalmes, &amp;c. In all there is the Popiſh conceit of <hi>apus operatum,</hi> that
the worke done pleaſeth God, that if they have faire ſervice and their
rites they are well, though they are no whit changed, enlightned, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened
in their conſciences, or altered and quickned in their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</p>
            <p>Adde hereunto that this wil-worſhip puffs men up with ſpirituall
pride;<note place="margin">Sect. 10.</note> Thus the Phariſees were proud of their often faſtings, and the
Friers are lifted up in great conceits of their holineſſe by their obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the rules of their orders, and formall Proteſtants in the obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of there cuſtomes and traditions. True Religion humbles men:
but empty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ceremonies like winde in a bladder puffe up the ſoule.</p>
            <p>Finally,<note place="margin">Sect. 11.</note> this wil-worſhip and teaching for doctrines mens precepts,
is oppoſite to true charity, in that it begets hatred againſt true and
zealous worſhippers of God, and this hatred ſhewes it ſelfe not onely
in evill thoughts, and beleeving all falſe reports, and hard cenſures
of them, but alſo in bitter invectives againſt them for not affecting and
liking their ſuperſtitious and virulent perſecution of thoſe that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
not to their practice, though it be onely becauſe of tenderneſſe
of conſcience. Hence it was that the Phariſees could better comply
with ſuch wicked men as <hi>Caiaphas, Pilate, Herod,</hi> then with Chriſt,
his Diſciples, and <hi>John Baptiſt;</hi> the Papiſts with Jewes, Turkes, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domits,
then with the godly Divines of the reformed Churches; the
formal Prelatiſts among Prote<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tants with the moſt prophane Libertines,
or Idolatrous Papiſts, then with a zealous preacher of the Goſpell; yea
the moſt ſtrict Phariſees have beene ſtill the moſt inceſſant perſecutors
of Chriſt, the moſt devout Friers, the moſt eager and bloody inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
the moſt zealous for Church Canons and Rites, the moſt heavy
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:155274:8"/>
and unrelenting deprivers, cenſurers and vexers of reverend Miniſters
and unſpotted Chriſtians, whom they have confeſſed to agree with
them in the ſame faith, and to diſſent onely from them in diſcipline
and Ceremonies.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It cauſeth contentions, Schiſmes, and diviſions in the
Church, witneſſe the great contentions betweene the Eaſterne and
Weſterne, Saxon and Brittiſh Churches, about Eaſter, Monkes and
Friers, about the rules of their orders conformiſts &amp; non-conformiſts,
about Ceremonies, which the defenders acknowledge but trifles, yet
promote with as much bitter zeale, as if <hi>Salus eccleſ ae verteretur in iſtis,</hi>
the ſafety of the Church, faith and Religion depended on
them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, By it Chriſtian liberty is impaired, which being a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
thing to a Chriſtian ſoule cannot be taken away without injury;
All wil-worſhip at firſt conception hath pretence of order and decency<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
perhaps the things in which it is placed are taken but as indifferent,
which yet in proceſſe of time gaine opinion of holineſſe and neceſſity
to that end, and ſo bring the conſcience into bondage.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, To conclude, this evill tends to the detriment of mens
goods, the pillaging of their purſes, for no benefit to the owners,
much hinderance to the poore, labouring Miniſters, and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
on which it ſhould be beſtowed. Many a pound is given in Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacies
and Contributions, is extorted by Courts, for maintaining
veſtments, organs, proceſſions, windowes, buildings, and other
things unneceſſary, when the poore want, painefull Preachers live on
a ſmall ſtipend, the Common-wealth is brought to ſtraights: For
ſuperſtition is coſtly, and ſuperſ<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>tious perſons are either laviſhly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe,
or ſlaviſbly ready to beſtow their goods for very vanities which
doe them no good, when by a right beſtowing of their goods they
might make them friends of the unrighteous Mammon and be re<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eived
into everlaſting habitations.</p>
            <p>For application of this truth.<note place="margin">Sect. 12.</note> That which hath beene ſaid may
helpe us to take the right dimenſions of this ſinne: as in all other
things pertaining to God, mans reaſon judgeth very corruptly, ſo in
particular about cenſuring of ſinnes: ſinnes which injure men, and
harme them in their bodies, goods or name, are accounted hainous,
and the acting of them ſtirres up mens Spirits to rage and fury againſt
the Authors. But ſinnes againſt Gods excellency and glory, though
they be indeed Camells, yet are ſwallowed downe as gnats. They
that cry out againſt theft, and murther, and ſlander, are very favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:155274:9"/>
in cenſuring Idolatry, blaſphemy and prophaneneſſe. Hence it
is that ſuperſtition is conceived harmeleſſe, and ſuperſtitious perſons,
though moſt injurious to God, yet counted harmeleſſe by men; it is
hard to convince men that this is a ſinne, or to bring them to any
ſerious repentance for it. But would men ſeriouſly lay to heart that
which hath beene ſaid, and judge righteous judgement, it would be
found that wil-worſhip is a ſinne of a deepe dye, eſtranging the heart
farre from God, and ſtirring up his ſoule againſt men, wherefore it
concernes eſpecially two ſorts of perſons to lay this to heart. Firſt,
the Papiſts, both Clergy and people, who are horribly guilty of this
point of Phariſaiſme in teaching &amp; obſerving innumerable doctrines &amp;
uſages of rites, cuſtomes, ceremonies after the Commandement of men
without Gods word. It were an infinite buſineſſe to reckon up all
their humane religious devices in their faſtings, Sacraments, burialls,
feſtivalls, Churches, religious orders, and the like. They pretend
that the Churches orders are Gods orders, and for that purpoſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<hi>Luk. 10. 16. Hee that heareth you, heareth mee: and bee that deſpiſeth you,
deſpiſeth mee.</hi> But this is abſurdly alledged. For this extends not to every
thing that the ſeventy diſciples (to whom thoſe words were ſpoken)
ſhould deviſe of themſelves: but onely to what they ſhould teach accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to that injunction <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 20. given to the Apoſtles, that they
ſhould teach all nations to obſerve al things whatſoever he commanded
them. And in this limitation he that heareth the leaſt miniſter of the
Goſpell heareth Chriſt, as well as he that heareth the Pope or a Synod
of Prelates, whom they ridiculouſly call the Church. They tell us that
their traditions are not <hi>contra legem,</hi> againſt the law, but <hi>praeter legem,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the law. To which we reply. The ſame might have been ſaid for the
Phariſees waſhings, for which nevertheleſſe our Saviour chargeth them
with hypocriſ<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e. And indeed though the things themſelves were not
plainely <hi>contra legem</hi> againſt Gods Law, yet the practice of teaching &amp; n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ng
ſuch things for or inſtead of Gods feare is directly againſt Gods
Law, which forbids us to adde or diminiſh from Gods commandements.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The late Prelaticall prevailing party of this Kingdome
may be charged as guilty of the ſame ſinne of which our Saviour indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
theſe Phariſees in whoſe ſteps they tread, I ſay the late Prelaticall
party, that I may not be thought to lay this imputation on the firſt
reformers, and their reverend ſucceſſors, who were conſtant and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Preachers of the Goſpell of Chriſt, and many of them confirmed
it by their ſufferings. I ſay the late prevailing Prelaticall party, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I conceive that ſome of the Prelates of this Land have beenemore
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:155274:9"/>
conſiderate then to urge and teach Commandements of men in that
manner that the prevailing party hath done. I mean in their teaching
and practiſe about Images, Crucifixes, Altars, Rayles, Tapers,
bowing to or towards Altars, praying towards the Eaſt, bowing at
the naming of the word Jeſus, conſecrating Churches, Confirmation,
Copes, Organes, Surpliſſes, Croſſing at the ſolemnity of Baptiſme,
and the like.</p>
            <p>All which have beene urged and uſed of late with a Phariſaicall and
Popiſh Spirit as if by the uſing them men were made more holy, God
ſerved, and the not conforming to them a crime of want of devotion
and reverence to God. And yet the ſame party ſhew themſelves ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries
to the conſtant and fruitfull preaching of Gods word, ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying
of the Lords day, exerciſing of the duties of Religion in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
houſes, as prayer, repeating of Gods word, prayſing of God, God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conference of Scripture, reformation of prophane ſwearing, exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
drinking, gaming, ſporting, and the like palpable ſinnes; they
inveigh much againſt the Sacriledge of keeping back tithes, and other
Eccleſiaſticall dues from Miniſters, and yet winke at it as if it were no
ſacriledge in Miniſters to pervert holy things to maintaine pompe and
riot, without doing the worke for which the wages is due, to wit
the laborious preaching of the Goſpell: turning the Miniſtry of the
word into an officiating Prieſt-hood to obſerve rites injoyned by Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
of men. The exception I conceive may be taken to this charge
is, That they are not urged as if they were neceſſary, but as things
indifferent, for order and decency. Whereto I reply.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That for ſome of them it cannot be conceived that they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,
but plainely evill, as the ſetting up of Images in Temples,
Crucifixes, &amp;c. For ſome of them it is not denyed but that they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
<hi>in ſe,</hi> of themſelves, and of their owne nature: For my part
I conceive that it is indifferent in it ſelfe to weare a white linnen gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or a blacke gowne, to pray with the face toward the Eaſt or
the Weſt: If any ſay they are ſimply in themſelves unlawfull, I cannot
excuſe them from negative ſuperſtition, in denying the uſe of that to
be lawfull, which God hath not forbidden to be uſed. For moſt of
them there can hardly be a colour of appointing them in their uſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
and urged for order and decency onely, ſith any man may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
perceive that they tend onely to bring in a gay ſenſe affecting
ſpendour in Gods ſervice, and ſerve to breed Jewiſh and Popiſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits
in the mindes of people. It is granted that many things are left
to the diſpoſing of the governours of the Church pertaining to order
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:155274:10"/>
and decencie, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 40. though it is to be conſidered that how farre
that permiſſion extends, it is not without difficulty to determine, and
oftentimes under pretext of that ſpeech many things are appointed
that pertaine not to meere order and decency. I adde further, that
ſome of them were intended in their inſtitution by the reformers to be
uſed onely for decency and orders ſake, though perhaps erroneouſly.
But as for the late urging and practiſing of them, by the late prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Prelaticall party,<note place="margin">Archbiſhop. Laud Epiſt. Dedic. before the relat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of his conference with Fiſher Heylin coale from the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar. Biſhop White An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton of the Sab. p. 20. Reeve in his expoſ. of the Cat.</note> they have beene urged for a further end then
order and decency, yea with a Phariſaicall minde, as hath beene
ſaid: And this may appeare from their writings, ſayings, and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
From their writings, which tell us, that thoſe Church Ceremonies
are the great witneſſe to the world, that men may ſee our devotion
and glorifie our Father which is in heaven; that the promoting
them is the ſettlement of Gods externall worſhip; that this buſineſſe of
promoting Church Ceremonies is the piety of the times, the good
worke in hand: which ſpeake exceſſively of the authority of the
Church, that with like reverence men are to obey the conmands of
Biſhops as Gods, when they command not things contrary to God,
that what is decreed in the holy Councells of Biſhops is all to bee at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to Gods will: that Church orders are to be obeyed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
examining the reaſons: in which writings wee finde that text,
<hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 10.<note place="margin">Biſhop An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drewes Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum: Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les kneeles puritan.</note> brought to binde Chriſtians to a Ceremony of bowing at
the naming of Jeſus, in the Church here, which is moſt clearely meant
of univerſall ſubjection of all perſons to Chriſt, wil they nill they, at the
day of Judgement, as appeares by comparing it with the text, <hi>Rom.</hi>
14 10, 11, 12. And that text <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 10. is produced for a materiall
Altar,<note place="margin">Biſhop An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the 18. <hi>ch</hi> of Cardinall Perrouns reply. Heylin Antid. Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln.</note> which the whole context ſhewes to be meant metaphorically.</p>
            <p>From their ſayings, as that frequent ſpeech, No Ceremony no Biſhop,
and yet Biſhops avouched to be <hi>jure divino,</hi> theſe impious yet frequent
ſpeeches, wherein to their owne inexcuſable ſhame, they ſticke not to
profeſſe that they love a Papiſt though an Idolater, better then a Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane,
whom they acknowledge not to differ from them in matters of
faith and religion, but onely in diſcipline and Ceremonies, that they
had rather joyne with the former then the latter.</p>
            <p>From their doings, as their conniving at, yea and favouring of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
but extreame ſeverity to thoſe that conformed not to their Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,
their cenſuring men for the meere omiſſion of them, ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
depriving, excommunicating, impriſoning, fining thoſe that
could ot yeeld to them though charged with no other crime, when
al ſort of erroneous teachers, and licentious livers, were tolerated
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:155274:10"/>
and greatly favoured, from their diſcountenancing preaching of the
Goſpell, and promoting a bare officiating miniſtry without preaching:
from their violent endeavours to obtrude on <hi>Scotland</hi> their rites, from
their practiſes in contriving the oath of the late Synod, and in a word,
from the whole courſe of their proceedings tending to ſuperſtition, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality
and Popery, as the Remonſtrance of the State of the Kingdome
by the Houſe of Commons in this preſent Parliament doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Sect. 13.</note> From hence ſome Apology may be framed for defence of
them that of late have diſuſed thoſe Ceremonies which heretofore they
uſed: Great outcries are made in ſome places againſt ſuch, as refractary
to Government, changeable with the times. The former imputation
is eaſily anſwered, if the conſcience conceive upon reaſon that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
of the uſe of them would be ſinfull. For no man will ſay that
in the uſe of unneceſſary Ceremonies, which the conſcience thinkes
upon probable grounds out of Gods word to bee unlawfull, a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
is bound to doe that which authority commands. As for the oth<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r
imputation, although it cannot be called a fault for a man to change
his minde upon reaſons not knowne or not conſidered ſo well before,
ſpecially in ſuch diſputable points; (For what judicious Divine is
there who hath not in ſome things altered his opinion? or what
meere man is he that may not by after thoughts correct the former?)
Yet the truth is, in point of Ceremony, and things indifferent, that
ſome things may be unlawfull at one time, which are not unlawfull
at another: For in ſuch things the differing circumſtances, intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and ends in uſing and impoſing them, may make them lawfull at
one time and unlawfull at another, without any lightneſſe or incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy
in the judgement: Who knowes not that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> one while
uſed the Ceremonies of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, which he would by no meanes
ſuffer to be uſed at another time? And in this preſent matter I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
they who have changed their opinion and practice may be juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by foure reaſons.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe as hath beene proved the Ceremonies heretofore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
and appointed as indifferent for order and decency onely, have
beene urged of late as needefull offices of holineſſe, as if they were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
evidences and meanes of devotion, of more moment then the
preaching of Gods word. Now it is the plaine doctrine of the Apoſtle
<hi>Col.</hi> 2. 20. when Ceremonies are obtruded as neceſſary, we are not to
ſubmit to them. If ye be dead with Chriſt, ſaith the Apoſtle, from the
rudiments of the world, why as though living in the world are ye
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:155274:11"/>
ſubject to ordinances. <hi>Peccant igitur</hi> ſaith Biſhop <hi>Davenant</hi> on thoſe
words, <hi>non modo qui nova decreta fabricantur in religione, ſed qui iiſdem
ſe ſubj<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ciunt, &amp; libertatem Chriſti ſanguine partam patiuntur ſibi eripi:
Quid ritibus oneramini? inquit Apoſtolus: quaſi diceret, veſtrum eſt hoc
jugum recuſare, &amp; in li<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>erate quâ Chriſtus vos liberavit perſtare, ut Paulus
m<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>net, Gal.</hi> 5. 1. That is, they therefore ſinne not onely who make
new decrees in Religion, but who ſubject themſelves to the ſame, and
ſuffer the liberty gotten by the blood of Chriſt to be taken from
them. Why are yee burdened with rites? ſaith the Apoſtle, as if he
ſhould ſay, It belongs to you to refuſe this yoke, and to perſiſt in the
liberty in which Chriſt hath freed you, as <hi>Paul</hi> admoniſheth, <hi>Gal.</hi>
5. 1.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Becauſe it is apparent by many proofes, and declared in
the Remonſtrance of the State of the Kingdome, that they have beene
urged and uſed for the reduction of Superſtition and Popery, and for
the hindering of true godlineſſe. Papiſts themſelves boaſted of it that
we were comming neare to them, and they gathered it from the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
face of this Church, as was of late in the urging and uſe of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies.
Beſides they began to corrupt the doctrine of Religion, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
that point of the free grace of God, as the booke called the
<hi>Cumerb<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rtant  ſelfe -Conviction</hi> proves from their writings. And it is
the rule of Maſter <hi>Francis Maſon</hi> in his booke of the authority of
the Church on 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 40. that when the Doctrine declineth, the
Ceremony is perverted. Now the Apoſtles practice is a ſure rule, who
having circumciſed <hi>Timothy</hi> would not yeeld to have <hi>Titus</hi> circumciſed,
when he ſaw that by yeelding, the preſervation of Chriſtian liberty
and of the truth of the Goſpell, was endangered: <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 3, 4,
5.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Becauſe they are found to foment Ignorance and ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the people. And this by innumerable experiments is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt,
that by reaſon of the conſtant continuance of them Religion is
placed in them, yea the omitting of a Ceremony is conceived an alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of Religion, they are zealous for them as if all their Religion
were placed in them. Nor is this onely in places where there hath beene
no Preacher to ſhew their errour: but alſo where they have been often
and fully taught the contrary. And indeed where humane Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
are p<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eciſely uſed, the word of God is little minded: Now
in this caſe though the things be indifferent in themſelves, yet are
they not to be uſed to the ſcandall of mens ſoules. It is the ſpeech
of the ſecond part of the Sermon of faſting in the ſecond Tome of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:155274:11"/>
Homilies, that Gods Church ought not, neither may it be ſo tyed to
that or any other order now made or hereafter to be made and deviſed
by the authority of man, but that it may lawfully and for juſt cauſes,
alter, change or mitigate thoſe eccleſiaſticall decrees and orders, yea
recede wholly from them and breake them, when they tend either to
ſuperſtition, or to impiety, when they draw the people from God, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then worke any ediſication in them.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Becauſe they have found them to increaſe more and more,
and the yeelding to ſome gives encouragement to adde more. Now
it is a rule agreed that Ceremonies if many are an intolerable burthen.
It makes the caſe of the Church Chriſtian worſe then that of the Jewes,
if as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> obſerves Epiſt. 119. <hi>ad Januarium,</hi> the Chriſtian
Church being freed from legall ordinances of God be burthened
with humane preſumptions. Now as he that will beare a little bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
will throw off all if more bee added to over burthen him,
ſo may that man that would beare a few Ceremonies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> juſtly throw off all
when the burthen is increaſed without meaſure: eſpecially ſith multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of Ceremonies ſhadow the Goſpell, making the Religion rather
carnall, like the Jewiſh, then ſpirituall, like the Chriſtian; &amp; hindering
the fruit thereof from ripening, as too many leaves doe a few grapes
that are covered by them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Sect. 14.</note> from hence we may take occaſion to admoniſh miniſters that
they avoid the way of theſe Phariſees, who taught for doctrines mens
precepts. Con<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ider I beſeech you whereto you are called, to be Miniſters
of Chriſt and Stewards of the myſteries of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 1. not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervers
of Ceremonies and teachers of Church orders: Give me leave
to expoſtulate with you. Are ye called to maintaine mens traditions?
or Gods word? the Ceremonies of men? or the Goſpell of Chriſt?
How will you then give your account to Chriſt when you are ſo zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
for mens traditions, ſo cold for his Goſpell? When ye exclaime
againſt them that omit an humane Ceremony, favour and commend
them that teach not the way of ſalvation? When yee foment the
hatred of the people againſt thoſe that diſuſe Ceremonies of men, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
them that neglect the Commands of God? when ye cheriſh the
ignorance and ſuperſtition of the common people which ye ſhould
labour to weede out of their hearts? Is it not enough for you to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
God in vaine but that ye teach men ſo to doe? I beſeech you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
that threatning before alledged, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29. 14. that for this cauſe
the wiſedome of the wiſe men ſhall periſh, and the underſtanding of
the prudent ſhall be hid. Remember the threatning, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 9.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:155274:12"/>
Therefore have I alſo made you contemptible and baſe before all the
people, according as yee have not kept my wayes, but have beene
partiall in the law.</p>
            <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Sect. 15.</note> From hence we may take occaſion to admoniſh the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to take heed of ſuch Phariſaicall teachers, as teach for Doctrines
Commandements of men: our Saviour Chriſt having manifeſted the
hypocriſie of the Scribes and Phariſees in this thing, bids his Diſciples
let them alone, telling them that they were blinde leaders of the blinde;
and if the blinde lead the blinde, both fall into the ditch, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. 14.
And elſewhere, Beware of the leaven of the Phariſees, which is hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie,
<hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 1. And ſurely people have neede to take heede of
ſuch teachers, ſith ſuperſtition, as it is a pernitious evill, ſo it eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
inſinuates into peoples mindes, and ſticks faſt in them under ſhew
of antiquity, decency and gravity. I know this will bee interpreted
as if it were a hainous thing to perſwade people to withdraw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
from the Miniſters of their Pariſh though never ſo negligent or
corrupt. But let Biſhop <hi>Bilſon</hi> anſwer for me, <hi>Imo populus ipſe defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ente
