            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>A Brief
Encomium
OF AN
HORSE
By way of Introduction.</head>
               <p>OF all four-footed Beaſts I cannot find any
ſo uſeful to man, and ſo ſerviceable as
is that generous Creature we call an
Horſe. Neither doth the pleaſure man receives
by him, come any ways ſhort of the profit he
reaps thereby. In peace he ſerves to till the
ground; and as he takes great pains in cauſing
the earth to bring forth its fruits in its proper
ſeaſon; ſo when produced, he labours no leſs
to lodge them where his maſter ſhall appoint.
If the gallantry of his Maſters ſpirits commands
him to the War, how chearfully he obeys, and
foams with impatience, till he ſhares in his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
ſelf-propounded honour!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:44463:9"/>
How troubleſome would Land-travail be,
were it not for this hardy and laborious crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
who in the darkeſt night through thick
and thin performs his journey, not valuing the
extremity of weather? And this he ſeemeth to
do out of pure gratitude to his feeder, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
this way to recompence his coſt; and
why not? ſince it is acknowledged by all intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
perſons, that an Horſe is endued with great
underſtanding, and, from my own experience,
often knows when he hath a fool on his back.
It is reported in Hiſtory, that <hi>Bucephalus,</hi> that
famed War-Horſe, would not ſuffer any to mount
him but <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, who then expreſt
all imaginable pride and ſatisfaction in bearing
ſo victorious a Conqueror. And that we may
ſee farther, how far this Creature is naturally
inclined to love man; I have read of one <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes</hi>
a King, whoſe Horſe ſo intirely loved
him, as that upon his Maſters death the beaſt
refuſed his beſt beloved food, and ſo continued
till he dyed.</p>
               <p>And that we may not altogether borrow ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of this kind from forreign parts, I ſhall
produce you this one and no more, obſerved
in the Battel fought on <hi>Marſton-Moor.</hi> A Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
of eminent note, being at that time
there mounted on an excellent Gelding, (whom
he had bred up from a Colt) charged the enemy
with much Gallantry; yet notwithſtanding it
ſo happened that he was ſlain: he that ſlew him,
obſerving his horſe to be much better than his
own, alighted and ſo exchanged; the horſe
immediately finding a rider on his back which

he was unaccuſtomed to bear, and now retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
as it were a reſentment for the death of his
Maſter, began to fling and bound, and never
gave off yarking till he threw his rider, and then
fell to him with his heels, which he exerciſed ſo
nimbly, that he gave his maſters overcomer not
the leaſt opportunity to eſcape, and having
kill'd him, left him, and ran into the body of his
own party.</p>
               <p>I know not whether this Horſe might not
deſerve as great eſteem, as ſuch horſes, who for
their love and tractableneſs have had Statues,
nay Cities erected to their memory. However
I muſt not applaud the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> who have raiſed
mangnificent <hi>Pyramids</hi> to thoſe, who have been
eminently ſerviceable in their Wars. But as I
muſt condemn, ſo I cannot but laugh at the
prepoſterous folly of that <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour,
who doted ſo much on a horſe, that he made
him a Senator.</p>
               <p>But in truth there is ſo much to be ſaid in the
praiſe of this noble uſeful creature, that ſhould
I write the one tenth thereof, there would be
no room for my enſuing matter. But by the way
this Encomium doth not belong to all Horſes,
but ſuch as are good. To the intent therefore you
may reap the pleaſure and profit from them, as
is afore expreſſed, I ſhall adviſe you to be very
curious in your choice and purchaſe. But it is
not to be expected that you will ever be provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with ſuch good horſes as what are of your
own breeding; wherefore that ſhall be the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of the following Chapter.</p>

               <head type="sub">The beſt Method of breeding Horſes.</head>
               <p>To avoid all prolixity and impertinency, take
this order as the moſt expedient: Let your ſtudd
of Mares be very choice, abounding with met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
and ſpirit, ſo muſt your Stallions be qualified
alſo, and let neither be defective in ſhape, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
and good marks. If you find any natural
defect in the Stallion, endeavour to mend them
in the Mare that ſhall be joyn'd to him, and ſo
let what is amiſs in the Mare be repaired in the
Horſe. As near as you can couple them young,
and handſome of ſize, neither too large nor too
ſmall, well limb'd, and well joynted, and ſee
that your Mare have a good fore-head, and a
large Womb: and have a ſpecial care that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them be diſeaſed, for that natural diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
will undoubtedly be hereditary in the Colt.
The moſt proper age for your Mare to be cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
is between three and four: from that time
to fourteen a Mare will bring forth; and an
Horſe will be fit to cover from three to fifteen
years old, and longer.</p>
               <p>The moſt convenient time for covering Mares
is delivered diverſly. Mr <hi>Markham</hi> is of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
that the beginning of <hi>March</hi> or <hi>May</hi> is
the fitteſt time: for by the coming about that
time they will be prepared for the coming of
Winter, <hi>whereas thoſe which fall after are neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
to encounter two great enemies; that is, hunger
and cold, with which the early Foal hath been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
familiar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:44463:10"/>
Others are of opinion that <hi>Lammas</hi> Foals
prove ever the beſt Horſes (if they are not ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of food) for having tryed the worſt of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
before Summer comes.</p>
               <p>Others affirm that the moſt convenient time
to have a Mare covered, is from the end of <hi>May</hi>
to the beginning of <hi>Auguſt;</hi> for by that means
the Mare ſhall foal at ſuch a time when the earth
hath cloathed her ſelf in green, I mean when
there is plenty of Graſs; for a Mare goes eleven
Months, and ſometimes ten days over; and ſo
by conſequence, if the Mare be covered at the
latter end of <hi>July,</hi> ſhe will foal at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of <hi>June,</hi> and ſo both will be well provided
for againſt the approach of a Gut-foundring Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>But for my part I am clearly of the opinion
of that excellent Gentleman Monſieur <hi>De Grey;</hi>
who declares that the beſt time for foaling is in
the dead of Winter, as either in <hi>December</hi> or <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary:</hi>
for by long experience he hath found out
contrary to other mens judgments, that from
the time of the covering, to the foaling of the
Mare, is juſt twelve months and ten days, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
it be a young Mare with her firſt Colt: <hi>ſo that
if the Mare be covered about St.</hi> Lucies <hi>day, which
is the thirteenth of</hi> December, <hi>then will ſhe foal
about St.</hi> Thomas <hi>day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next thing that is to be thought on, is
how to couple Male and Female when they are
ready to ingender. In the firſt place, let them be
both well fed, ſo that they may have the greater
ſtrength to perform the work of Generation;
nor will it be amiſs to take blood from both the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44463:11"/>
ſides of the neck of your Mare, well nigh a pottle:
let this be done ſeven days before ſhe is covered;
and being thus phlebotomiz'd, the next day
faſting, and the next to that give her Mugwort
chopped very ſmall, and put into a quart of
milk, with an Ounce and a half of <hi>London</hi> Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
and a piece of Butter: let theſe be diſſolved
over a fire, and given the Mare warm in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
This drink doth not only comfort and
ſtrengthen the Matrix, but it alſo increaſeth
ſeed wonderfully, and inables her to retain what
ſhe hath received from the Stallion. Let the time
of covering be as near as you can, either three
days after the change, or three days before the
full of the Moon, allotting them ſome conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
place where they may be two nights and a
day.</p>
               <p>The Symptoms of a Mares not conceiving af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
covering are theſe; ſhe will be continually
neighing at the ſight or hearing of any Horſe;
ſhe will piſs very often, her eyes will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
rolling and gazing at every thing, prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up her ears. The Symptoms of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
are firſt a good ſtomach to her Proven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and that in five or ſix days her belly ſeemeth
to be more lank, her skin more ſlick and ſmooth,
and altering its complexion into a colour ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more bright; and laſtly ſhe will appear leaner
than before.</p>
               <p>Being with ſoal let her run in the dryeſt
grounds, yet not ſo barren as that her belly
ſhould be pincht for want of convenient ſuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence.
Being within two months of her time
let her be carefully taken up, for fear of hurting
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44463:11"/>
her foal, and kept within doors to the time of
her delivery: that time being at hand, let her
be kept in a warm room with good ſtore of ſtraw
under, that in the fall the Colt ſhould receive no
prejudice by bruiſing. Where it is to be noted
that a Mare foals ſtanding, and let her be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
watched, leſt the Colt ſhould come wrong.
After the Mare hath foaled and licked her Colt
dry, before the Colt come to ſuck, let ſome bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
milk the Mare, which will make her give
down her milk the better, and keep the milk
from clodding in the Udder. If you fear the
Mare will become dry; then take ſome of her
own Milk with ſome Spike or Lavender, and
boil them together, then take and bathe her Ud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
therewith daily for the ſpace of ſeven days,
and this will infallibly diſſolve the curd and hard
knobs therein. As ſoon as the Mare hath foaled
give her a warm Maſh, adding thereunto the
powder of Brimſtone: after this ſhe may ſafely
labour, provided it be moderately, and it will
conduce to the health and ſtrength of them
both.</p>
               <p>Now for as much as ſome Mares for want of
right ordering, become barren, I ſhall here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
how all or moſt a Studd ſhall be made to
prove fruitful. In the firſt place, if there be a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicion
that ſome of the Mares in the Studd after
covering have not conceived, then take a freſh
Stallion and a Mare or two that are eagerly
deſirous to be covered, and turn them together
into your ſtudd; he having covered theſe, the
reſt ſeeing this that did not conceive, will infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly
come to this Stallion, and ſo by this means
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44463:12"/>
moſt of the Mares will be reſtrained from being
unfruitful.</p>
               <p>If a Mare have a difficult labour, and there is
danger in her foaling, my advice is that her no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils
be held cloſe, ſo that ſhe cannot draw her
breath; but if that prevail not, then take of
Madder, the quantity of a Pullets Egge, and
diſſolve it in a pint of ſtale Ale, and being warm,
pour it down the Mares throat, and this will
much help her delivery. If her after-birth or
Secundine come not away, then take three hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls
of Fennel and as much Malmſy, and boil them
together in running water; then take half a
pint hereof Luke-warm, and pour it into the
Mares noſtrils, holding them cloſe a little while,
and this will help her; but by any means let her
not eat her cleanſing (which many are deſirous
of) for it is unwholſom, and an hindrance to
her Milk.</p>
               <p>Let not the Colt run with the Dam, leſs than
a year; if it may ſtand with your convenience
let it be longer, for that will ſtrengthen the Colt.
When the Colt is to be wean'd, you muſt ſo
ſeparate him from the Dam, that he may be out
of her hearing, and not ſuffer'd to ſtir out of
doors in ſixteen days. It will be very requiſite
to have paſture adjoyning to the place wherein
they are, but ſuch it muſt be that it be neither
rank nor barren, for a ſhort ſweet graſs will
nouriſh them moſt, and add very much to the
increaſe of their growth: be ſure that at this
time they want nothing, for what they loſe in
the firſt year, they will ſcarcely gain in four.</p>
               <p>At their weaning neglect not to give them
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44463:12"/>
Butter and Savin for divers mornings, for that
will kill that worm which otherwiſe will deſtroy
them. The firſt Winter let not Hay be wanting, nor
oats in the ſheafe, or the offal of any other grain.</p>
               <p>From two years old upward beware that in
the Winter your Colt lye not wet, nor in the
Summer feed on rank graſs; for the firſt very
much diſheartens him, and lays him open to all
manner of watry cold diſtempers; and the other
renders him an ill ſhapen ſloathful Beaſt, being
always inclined (by reaſon of his over great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of fleſh and fat) to catch the Glanders, and
Cough upon every ſlight and inconſiderable cold.
Wherefore your beſt Summer feeding for your
young horſes is where they are not ſtreightned
for want of ground, and that they muſt be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to take pains for a belly full; and let them
not cover any Mare till above five years old, for
ſooner will debilitate their ſtrength, and impair
their growth, with farther prejudice.</p>
               <p>And to this end, as you ſeparate Foals from
the Dams, ſo you muſt ſeparate the Male Colts
from the Females; for frequent experience may
inform you that by plentiful and full feeding the
Horſe-Colts have covered the Mare-Colts at a
year old, to the deſtruction of them both.</p>
               <p>As for gelding of Colts you may indifferently
take any time from a foal of four months to four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
years; but the beſt time for making of fine
Geldings, is when you perceive the ſtones to fall,
or when eleven days old; taking this courſe,
you go a ſafe way to work, which will alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
moſt incomparable Cheſts. When you go
about this work, let it be in the wane of the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44463:13"/>
Moon, and the Spring is the fitteſt ſeaſon for ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
your purpoſe.</p>
               <p>If you would have your Stone-Horſe, Gelding,
or Mare familiar and tractable, begin with them
from the firſt weaning to make him acquainted
with you by ſtroking, rubbing and haltering him,
leading him to water, frequently taking up his
feet, and ſometimes knocking his hoofs, and the
like.</p>
               <p>As to breaking of Colts to the ſaddle, ſeveral
men, ſeveral minds; ſome are for breaking
them at three years old, others at four; but it
is the opinion of the moſt judicious, that that
Horſe which is broken at five, will hold out long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
than any other, and ſhall not be ſo inclinable
to diſeaſes, nor will he eaſily be acquainted with
the ill quality of Tiring.</p>
               <p>By your thus prudent giving your Horſe his
full time before you handle him, his joynts and
ſinews grow ſtrong, and are well knit together,
his hoofs will grow tough, his eye-ſight quick
and good, his chine ſo ſtrong that you cannot
hurt it in reaſonable riding, and will continue
a good ſerviceable Horſe will twenty ſix years of
age.</p>
               <p>The evil effects of taking him up ſooner will
plainly appear in a little time by his blindneſs,
weakneſs of back, brittleneſs of hoof, beſides
his Wind Galls and Splints; and in ſhort,
before he arrives to half his age, he will appear
an old horſe, and rejected by all, as having ſeen
his beſt days.</p>
               <p>And that you may not be miſtaken in the good
properties and ſhape of thoſe Colts you intend
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:44463:13"/>
for your own ſervice, take theſe obſervations: a
Colt when but five weeks old will carry the ſame
ſhape then, whether good or bad (if not abuſed
in the mean time) as he will have at five years
old. If a Foal have a large ſhin bone that is long
from the knee to the paſtern, it foreſhoweth a tall
Horſe; the double of that ſpace of a foal newly
foaled between the knee and the withers, will
be juſt his height when he is arrived to full
growth. Take notice which of your Colts have
moſt active ſpirits, wanton, ever leaping, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and playing, and ſtriving to out-run the
reſt of his fellows; ſuch always prove high met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
Horſes: but if on the contrary you find them
dull, unactive, ſeldome ſtirring, but melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
you may aſſure your ſelf they will prove er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
jades.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, to conclude my diſcourſe of breeding
horſes, let me adviſe the owner of a good Studd
not to make too early a coiling or election; for
ſome horſes ſhow their beſt ſhape at two years
old, and loſe at four; others not till ſix or ſeven,
and ever after retain it; but ſooner or later, let
him preſerve the beſt for himſelf; thoſe of incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
deformities, as Sorrances, Spavens, Ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bones
or imperfect eyes, ſend them to the Market.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of the properties belonging to good Horſes,

               <p>I Muſt confeſs, an horſe may be good and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable,
who hath neither good colour, true
marks, or perfect ſhape; however I would not
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44463:14"/>
have thoſe three good properties contemned or
ſlighted; for that Horſe cannot be bad in whom
thoſe properties remain: and if an Horſe well
mettled, bold, and hardy, yet of a gentle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
of a round and comely trot or pace, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient
mouthed, ſure of foot, tough, ſtrong,
and eaſie, is to be valued and eſteemed; then for
certain if to theſe good qualifications there be
added good colour, true marks, and perfect
ſhape, I know not what will make him more
conſiderably valuable; ſo that his owner ſhall be
dayly courted to part with him at his own
terms. Now to the intent you may underſtand
what theſe good properties be, which belong to
a good Horſe, obſerve what an ingenious For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigner
ſaith of them. <hi>There are,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>three
of an Oxe, three of a Fox, three of a Hart, and
three of a Woman: Thoſe of an Ox<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> are a fair full
eye, a large neck, and to be ſtrong and ſhort joynted:
thoſe of a Fox are to have a comely ſhort trot, ſmall
and long ears, and a buſhy tail: thoſe of an Hart
are to have lean and dry legs, to be well riſen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and a lean head: thoſe of a Woman are to be
large and fair breaſted, to have a beautiful and full
hair, and gentle to her Rider and Keeper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to the intent I may trace the ſame Author
farther, be pleaſed to take notice of theſe his
following obſervations in his own words: <hi>Theſe
Horſes that have a black mane and a black tail are
ſeldome bad. If the Sorrel have a black liſt along
his back, and if his Mane, Tail, Knees, and Fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks
be black alſo, he is generally good: the Brown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bay,
Dun, Dapple-grey, and Iron-grey are uſually
very good. But <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> all Horſes muſt have
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:44463:14"/>
good legs, good feet, and their Fetlocks not incumbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with too much hair; they muſt have quick eyes,
obedient mouths, and high mettled; their legs by
no means fat or fleſhy, but a large belly well ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
before, ſtreight backt, and not charged with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
great ſhoulders: he muſt have a thin bended neck
hooking in to his breaſt, a good Crouper, large thighs,
round well ſpread Buttocks, and a train well ſet on,
a lean, dry, and thin head, a full ſparkling eye, a
a wide Noſtril, a wide, thin, and lean Jaw, a
looſe Trople, a well truſſed body, and legs not over
long; the fore-legs above the knees muſt be ſtrong,
flat, and large, although the lower part the ſame
legs muſt be ſmall. Thus much <hi>of the general</hi>
ſhape <hi>of Horſes;</hi>
                  </hi> Let us next conſider their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.</p>
               <p>Though the <hi>Black-Roan,</hi> or <hi>Black,</hi> full of ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
hairs, <hi>Cole-Black, Cheſnut-Black</hi> with a <hi>Star</hi>
in the forehead, <hi>Dark-Bay, Fly-bitten,</hi> or <hi>White-Lyard,</hi>
be lookt on as well colour'd Horſes;
yet the <hi>Brown-Bay</hi> is to be prefer'd before them
all; and therefore the <hi>French,</hi> with other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
have the <hi>Brown-Bay</hi> in ſo great eſteem, that
they call him <hi>Truſty Bayard.</hi> Now as to Colours
in general, the <hi>French</hi> have theſe three in greateſt
eſtimation among them, the <hi>Cheſnut</hi> and <hi>Cole-Black,</hi>
but principally the <hi>Brown-Bay.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So much of Colours; now for the Marks: All
men have a good liking to the <hi>White Star,</hi> and
<hi>white foot,</hi> if the blaze be not over large, or the
foot too white about the paſtern, for then it is
called buskend; the ſhine or raſe down the face,
if it be no broader than two fingers, ending ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
between the Noſtrils, is commendable; and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:44463:15"/>
if it be not broader on the one ſide of the face
than it is on the other, it is prized among the
compleateſt Horſemen for the beſt ornamental
Mark an Horſe can be endued withal. Different
are the opinions of men concerning their feet,
ſome praiſing the white on the far foot behind,
others on the near foot before, others would
have the white a Croſs, that is, the far foot behind
and the near foot before.</p>
               <p>All skill'd in horſe-fleſh do affirm, that an Horſe
with much white on his face, raw noſed, ſheath,
yard, tuel, and hoofs white, skin white, and
legs hoſed, and wall-eyed, is for the moſt part
weak, faint, and of a cowardly diſpoſition, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and waſhy of fleſh, ſubject to Rebellion,
reſtiſeneſs, to ſtarting, ſtumbling, evil ſighted,
ſubject to tire, and let his keeper have a ſpecial
care of his biting and kicking.</p>
               <p>Let us now conſider the particular ſhape of an
Horſe: In the firſt place it is required in a well
timber'd Horſe, that his hoof be black, ſmooth,
large, dry, round, and hollow, the paſterns
ſtraight and upright, the fore-head lean and
large, the eyes great, full, and black, the brows
well filled, the Jaws wide, ſlender, and lean,
the Noſtrils wide and open, the mouth great,
the head long and lean, the Mane thin and
large, the Withers ſharp and pointed, the back
ſhort, even, and plain, the ſides and ribs deep,
large and bearing out like the bottom of a Tray,
and cloſe ſhut at the huckle bone, the belly long
and great, but hid under the ribs, the flanks full,
yet gaunt, the rump round and plump, with a
large ſpace between the buttocks, the thighs long
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:44463:15"/>
large, the hams dry and ſtraight, the Truncheon
ſmall, long, well ſet on, and well couched, the
train long, not too thick, the Yard and Stones
ſmall. To deſcribe the perfect ſhape of an Horſe
in fewer words is thus; a broad forehead, a great
eye, a lean head, wide Jaws, yet thin, ſlender
and lean, a long high reared Neck, high reared
Withers, a broad deep Cheſt and body, upright
paſterns, and narrow hoof.</p>
               <p>To conclude, if an Horſe be well colour'd,
rightly ſhaped, and truly marked, coming of a
good breed, it is very much if his actions anſwer
not the expectations of the moſt curious Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
ſo be it that the Horſe hath not been ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
either by backing or riding.</p>

of Horſes.</p>
               <p>For a Souldier or a Travailer the Trot is moſt
convenient; and herein obſerve the neatneſs of
his lifting his limbs from the ground, for if he
treads ſhort, open, and even, then is his pace
very commendable.</p>
               <p>For great perſons and thoſe that love their
eaſe, the Amble is beſt: if for Hunting or
for an Hackney, the racking pace is moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</p>
               <p>As for a good Gallop obſerve this, that Horſe
which without lifting his feet high taketh them
up nimbly from the ground, that ſtretching out
his forelegs with the hinder followeth them nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
without cutting under the knee, and doth
not croſs or clap one foot upon another, and
ever leadeth with his far fore foot, and not with
the near, is the beſt ſort of Galloper, both for
ſpeed and comlineſs.</p>
               <p>Concerning the ſtature of an Horſe, it muſt
be left to the judgment of the Buyer, to fit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
according as his occaſions will require: the
largeſt and ſtrongeſt for Car-Horſes and great
Draughts, the middle ſize for recreation, and
for general uſe, the ſmaller ſort for Women
or for Summer journeys.</p>
               <p>I have already ſpoken of ſome beauties and
deformities which belong to Horſes in general,
but particularly take account of theſe few more,
that you may know how to make a good bargain
and not to be cheated in Horſe-fleſh.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, when any Horſe is offered you
to ſell; if you can, firſt inquire of what breed he
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:44463:16"/>
came, and what his pace is, and having obſerved
his colour, take a ſtrict view of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance;
if he looks chearfully and lively, you
may conjecture he doth not want mettle: in
the like nature it is a ſign of vivacity and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
as well as a mark of beauty, to have his
ears pricked, ſmall, thin, ſharp, and always in
motion; but when they hang flagging and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionleſs,
it is the infallible ſymptom of heavineſs
and bad nature.</p>
               <p>A ſwelling forehead, a white ſtar, a white
rach neither too big nor too little, with a white
ſnip on the noſe, are tokens of comlineſs &amp; good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
but if the rach ſtand awry, the forehead
flat, and the noſe be raw inſtead of a white ſnip,
no greater marks of deformity. In like nature
little eyes (Pig ey'd as they call it) are uncome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſigns, and diſcover weakneſs; whereas on the
contrary, black, bright, round, large eyes, ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
as it were out of his head are the ſigns of
a good natured mettleſome Horſe: red and fiery
eyes are little better than Moon-eyes, and not
far from blindneſs. Wall-eyes are ever bad,
weak ſighted, and do declare a baſe nature;
if with white ſpeeks, they are next door to the
pearl, pin or web; if watry and bloody, the Horſe
hath ſuſteined bruiſes; and if they matter, they
are ſigns of old over-riding; and laſtly, if the
eyes be black, yet fill not the pit ſo, but that in
every motion the white glearingly appears, you
may conclude that Horſe weak and of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractable
diſpoſition.</p>
               <p>If the Thropple or Wind-pipe be large, and
the Jaws very open, they are ſigns of ſoundneſs
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:44463:17"/>
of head, and that he hath great wind, with cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage;
if the Thropple be ſmall, and kernels
thereabout, you may then judge the contrary,
and that the Horſe is inclined to the Glanders,
or is ſeiſed with a very ſoul cold. Now as to
the teeth, be careful of buying an Horſe that
wanteth any, for it is the opinion of the expert,
he were as good want all, as loſe one.</p>
               <p>See that his breaſt be broad, and out ſwelling,
which ſhews he hath great ſtrength, and will
hold out a long time; the little breaſt ſhews
weakneſs, and is the ſign of uncomelineſs; the
narrow breaſted Horſe is moſt commonly a
ſtumbler, and the inwardly hidden breaſt will
not indure hard labour.</p>
               <p>Let his fore thighs be Ruſh-brown, well ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
and horny; but have a care they be not
ſwel'd, otherwiſe they are certain ſigns of
ſtrength, the contrary are ſigns of weakneſs.</p>
               <p>His legs muſt be clean, and the bought of the
knee without a ſeam or hair broken; if you find
ſcabs under his knee on the inſide, it is the ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut,
and very unfit to Gallop; and if his legs
be round, fat, and fleſhy, the Horſe is altogether
unſerviceable and unfit to take pains.</p>
               <p>So that one paſtern be clean and well knit,
and the other ſhort, ſtrong, and upright ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
for if the firſt be ſwel'd, you have cauſe
to ſuſpect ſinew ſtrains, and gurding; if the
other be long and bending, that Horſe is moſt
ſubject to tire.</p>
               <p>Good Hooves ought to be black, not quite
round, but ſmooth, yet tough: a white hoof
is naught, being tender, not carrying a ſhoe
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:44463:17"/>
well; an hoof that is rough and groſs ſeemed,
denotes old age, or that the Horſe hath been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-heated;
a brittle hoof will not carry a ſhoe;
a very round hoof is bad for deep, dirty ways;
a flat hoof ſhews foundering. The Crownet of
the hoof is ſound, if the hair be ſmooth and cloſe,
and the fleſh even; but if the fleſh riſe, the skin
mangy, and the hair ſtaring, you may then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
a Ring bone, a Crown ſcab, or ſomething
every whit as bad.</p>
               <p>Look now to the Chine of his back, and ſee
that it be broad, even, and ſtraight, his ribs
large, and bending outward, his buttock round
and plump, his ſtones cloſe truſſ'd up to his body,
his Gaſcoyns well let down to the middle joynt
very full &amp; thick, his hinder legs lean and ſinewy;
if they be ſwel'd the greaſe is molten into them,
if ſcabbed above the paſterns, he hath the ſcratch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
if chaps under his paſterns, he hath the pains,
and theſe are both noiſome and dangerous.</p>
               <p>To conclude, his tail muſt ſtand broad, high,
flat, and ſomewhat tauched inward, but a good
buttock will produce a good tail, and a bad one
can never have a tail to ſit well thereon.</p>

                  </gap>holerick;
the colour that denotes a Cholerick Horſe is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a Bright-Sorrel, a Coal-Black, or an Iron-Gray
unchangeable: Theſe are light, hot, and
fiery, but at the beſt but weak and feeble: the
diſeaſes they are moſt incident to, are Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Liver, Peſtilential Feavers, and the
Yellows: to prevent which diſtempers, Choler
in them ought to be purg'd, but gently, becauſe
at their beſt ſtrength they are weak of conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
ſo that without having this conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
by the imprudent adminiſtration of too
ſtrong a potion, inſtead of curing, an Horſe may
be confounded.</p>
               <p>An Horſe of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that attends this complexion is either a
Bright-Bay, or a Dark-Bay, having no white
flank, White-Flea-bitten, Black with a white
ſtar or white foot. The nature of theſe Horſes
is to be pleaſant, of great ſtrength, nimble and
free: the diſeaſes concomitant are Conſumption
of the Liver, Glanders, Leproſie, with other
infectious Diſtempers. As their natures are
ſtrong, ſo they will indure the application of
ſtrong medicaments, eſpecially ſuch as cool the

                  </gap>hlegmatick, and the colour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
belonging is either Pide-Ball, Milk-White,
Kite-glew'd, or Yellow-Dun; theſe beaſts are
much inclin'd to ſloth, and are very waſhy; the
diſeaſes which accompany this Complexion are
Rheumes, Staggers, Colds, and Head-Ache,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> By reaſon of the great quantity of Flegm
which doth infeſt their bodies, ſtrong medicines
will not hurt them, having ſo much matter to
work upon.</p>
               <p>The fourth complexion is called Melancholy,
and that hath more of Earth in it than Fire, Air,
or Water; his proper colour is a Mouſe-Dun,
Aſh-Gray, Dark-Bay with Mayly mouth, Red

Cheſtnut. They are naturally dull and coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
they are afflicted with the Dropſie, Frenzy,

Medicaments are injurious to their natures, but
cold and moiſt are beneficial.</p>
               <p>There is a fifth Complexion held by Farriers,
being as they ſay, an equal compoſition or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture
of the four Elements; and this conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
they highly applaud, in that one Element
is not more predominant than another, being
ſo equally temper'd that there is no overflowing
in either: and this Temperament participates
of all colours, as Brown, Bay, Dabled, or not
Dabled, the Black full of ſilver Hair, Dable-Gray,
or a fair Roan, Red or Black; theſe they
affirm are moſt healthful, gentle, ſtrong, and
temperate, and inclinable to no diſeaſe: all
this any man would believe, if there were any

that the four Elements ſhould be ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
and equally temper'd in any body, but
that one muſt be more powerful than the reſt;
and ſo conſequently the Horſes Conſtitution muſt
incline to that Element which moſt aboundeth
in him. But of the temperaments of an Horſe,

               <p>TO incourage you in the noble Art of Riding,
I have in brief diſcovered to you what a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
and profitable Creature an Horſe is to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind;
and that you might at no time want a
good one, I have indeavoured to inſtruct you
how you ſhould ſo breed them, that you ſhould
not fail in your expectations; or if you did, then
how to buy a good one both by marks, ſhape,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:44463:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and Colour; and having obteined your deſire,
let us now conſider the office and duty of a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p>Some there are ſo opinionative, that being
able to ſit a rough unridden Colt a few plunges
by holding Monkey like, with both hands to the
Mane and Pummel, clinging with both legs to
the ſide of the Horſe, as if they would clip
him in two, which puts the poor beaſt into ſo
great a diſorder, that by his violent flinging and
flounſing, he agitates the poor Beaſt clear out of
wind; having made him thus breathleſs, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
will ſerve his turn, but the appellation of a
compleat Horſe-man.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place let me perſwade you, not
only to lay aſide vain glory, but cholerick im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience;
for no man, let him love the Art ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſo well, can make a compleat Horſe-man if
he be raſh and haſty; neither will an Horſe
learn his precepts if he be not otherwiſe incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
and therefore if he prove bad, his faults
and defects muſt not be imputed ſo much to his
ill nature, as his indiſcreet Rider.</p>
               <p>Wherefore avoid ſeverity to your young
Horſe, for it is a Maxime laid down by that <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
Horſe-man,</hi> Thomas de Grey <hi>
                     <abbr>Eſq</abbr> He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be a good Horſe-man who wanteth knowledge
how to bring his Horſe to perfection by fair, ſweet, and
gentle means, rather than by correction and ſevere cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſement:</hi>
however the whip muſt not always be
neglected if he doth amiſs; if well, let him be
cheriſhed, by ſtroaking and otherways to incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
him in well doing; for an Horſe is a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of great underſtanding.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:44463:20"/>
Let your Groom frequently toy and play with
him, be continually talking to him in ſome odd
phraſe or other, for this pleaſeth a good natur'd
Horſe: let him morning and evening ride him
a little way abroad, but he muſt have a care he do
not heat him too much: he muſt duly curry,
curb, and dreſs him, wipe, pick, and cleanſe
him, feed and cheriſh him, keeping him ſweet
and warm, be often imployed about him, tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering
with his legs and heels, frequently taking
up his feet, rapping him gently on the ſoles, and
ſoftly knocking him on the Coffins; by this
means he will be brought to lift up his foot at firſt
bidding.</p>
               <p>Before you put your Horſe to graſs (if you
have rid him a journey) take ſome ſmall quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of blood from him three or four days before
you turn him out: but I would not adviſe you
to put him forth till about the tenth of <hi>May.</hi> If
your horſe hath been pampered in a warm ſtable,
I would have you uſe him to ſome hardneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you put him to graſs, for otherwiſe he may
be ſubject to take cold; and when you take him
up from graſs, let it be about the latter end of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt,</hi>
for then the ſeaſon will be troubled with
cold dews, and the heart of graſs beginneth then
to fail; but in the taking of him up have a care
of heating of him, becauſe that fat he got at
graſs is not firm, but ſomewhat tender; two
days after you have him in the ſtable, then blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
him again, which will prevent a great many
diſeaſes which are occaſioned by the Gaul and
Spleen.</p>
               <p>Make frequent inſpection into your Horſes
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:44463:20"/>
mouth, for fear of Barbes, Cankers, Bigs, Bli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
and theſe you may diſcover by the ſpots
of the Gums, Tongue, and Mouth, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
make ſpeedy applications for their cure.
And to this end both waſh and rub his mouth
with Verjuice and Bay-Salt mingled together,
and all the better if you let ſome paſs down his
throat. If your Horſes eyes look dull and drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy
more than uſual, you may juſtly ſuppoſe him
to be ill; and to prevent the growth of his
diſtemper, give him the drink of a Diateſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron.</p>
               <p>If you find your Horſe halt, or favour one foot
more than the other, let his foot be immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
examined, let him take off the ſhooe, and
ſearch for Gravel or a Nail; if you find none,
yet perceive the foot warmer than the reſt, then
ſearch the heel and fruſh; if all well there, then
higher to the paſtern joynt in the leg, or back
ſinew: having found the fault, let the Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier
be inſtantly acquainted with his mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
               <p>When you are to take your journey with him,
let him be water'd in the houſe, giving him an
indifferent quantity of good clean Oats, then
tying him up to the rack, curry, dreſs, and ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
him, leaving his girts looſe, and do not
draw them ſtrait till you are going to mount
him; then ride him ſoftly for the firſt three miles,
that you may prevent crudities, and that he may
digeſt his meat the better: three miles before you
come to your journeys end, ride him into ſome
River (if any near you) up to his belly, but not
deeper, and ſo let him drink, not all at once,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:44463:21"/>
but by degrees; then ride him an indifferent
pace, to warm his water in his belly, which will
ſo refreſh him, that forgetting his wearineſs, he
will fall to his meat with the greater appetite.
Having brought him to the ſtable, tye him up
to the empty rack, and litter him up to the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and be ſure that after you have cauſed him
to be well rubbed, both belly, legs, back, neck,
face, and head, alſo the breaſt; then upon a
cloth let his ſaddle be clapt on, and ſo let him
ſtand almoſt an hour.</p>
               <p>As for thoſe Leſſons you intend to teach your
Horſe which are fit for his practice, and the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
for which you intend him; as if it be for
Hunting, Running, Travail, Hackney, or the
like; then the chiefeſt things you are to apply
your ſelf to, are to preſerve a good mouth, to
trot freely and comely, to amble ſurely and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily,
to gallop ſtrongly and ſwiftly, to obey
the hand in ſtopping gently, and retiring wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly,
and to turn on either hand, readily and

for the Race.</head>
               <p>AS for the time of keeping the Race Horſe, it
is not certainly concluded upon by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of this Art, for ſome would have it an half
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:44463:21"/>
year at leaſt, though they have no other ground
for it, but that if he ſhould run ſooner he may
indanger the melting of his greaſe by that vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
and too early exerciſe; that thereby ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
will be too haſtily ſtirred, and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
bring upon them innumerable diſeaſes;
and hereupon they conclude that to bring
him to it gradually with length of time is moſt
expedient, not conſidering the great charge the
owner muſt infallibly be at, and it may be it will
eat up the profit of the price.</p>
               <p>Beſides, they diſcover much ignorance herein
by not conſidering that if greaſe ſhould be melted
(which of all hands is confeſt very dangerous)
it may be purged away by wholſome ſcourings:
humours too ſuddainly ſtir'd, and ſo diſperſing
themſelves to the great detriment of the body,
may be evacuated by ſweat and moderate Air<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
               <p>But if half a year be too long, pray what time
then is moſt convenient, you will ſay? For this
purpoſe of preparation it is the opinion of the
moſt expert judicious Feeders, that ſeven or
eight weeks is time long enough for an old trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Horſe.</p>
               <p>And leſt any ill humour ſhould lurk within
the body of an Horſe, and ſo detriment the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
purpoſe of his ſwift and free running;
I would adviſe you to elect ſuch nouriſhing ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
(and not a miſh maſh of I know not what
poiſonous ingredients) which may bring away
any melted greaſe or ill humour which offends
the body, without delaying time; and by this
courſe you may better and much more forward
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:44463:22"/>
intents in four days than others in four months;
for by their deferring time (as Mr. <hi>Markham</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves)
they nor no man elſe can certainly tell
which way the melted greaſe, and other foul
humours will avoid; whether into his Ordure,
and that's the ſafeſt; whether into ſweat, which
is hazardous; into his limbs, which is miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous;
or remain, and putrefie in his body, which
is mortally dangerous.</p>
               <p>But when I adviſe you to ſcour, my intent
and meaning is, that you ſhould not run into
the extreams of ſome fooliſh perſons; who are
never at reſt but when they are giving their Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
ſome ſtop or other, which they call a potion,
or ſcourings, moſt commonly without cauſe,
and always without order; thereby ſo debili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating
the poor Creature, that though he may
be willing, yet is rendered incapable of running
that courſe which muſt be performed with
ſo much ſtrength, vigour, agility, and ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>From over doing or under doing, the Feeder
ought to make choice of a mediocrity: if he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to purge, let him be ſure he have a juſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
for ſo doing; and that is, when he is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that foul humours abound; and let the
means by which he intends to evacuate them
be wholſome ſimples, being confident in what
he preſcribes that it will rather add to the
Horſes vigour, than diminiſh from it; ſo with
deſerved applauſe he ſhall ſucceed in his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize.</p>
               <p>If your Horſe be over fat, or foul, or newly
taken from graſs, my advice is, that you diet
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:44463:22"/>
him two months at leaſt before you let him run
the Race-match; if the wager will permit, take
a longer time. If he be very poor by over riding
or ſome other diſorder, take what time you can
above five weeks; but ſix will ſerve, exerciſing
him well with his feeding. But if your Horſe
be in a mediocrity and good temperament of
body, a month is time enough to fit and adapt
him for his race.</p>

and having tied his bridle to the rack, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it is put on him, waſh't in beer; cleanſe your
ſtable well; and then fall to dreſſing your Horſe,
which you may do in this manner.</p>
               <p>Firſt curry him well all over; then duſt him
with an Horſes tayl, or ſome clean duſting
cloth; then with your wet hand ſtroke all his
body over, not leaving any looſe hair to ſtick
upon him: having thus done, wipe him dry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:44463:23"/>
and be ſure to cleanſe his ſheath, ſtones,
and tuel, his ears, eyes, and noſtrils. Then
muſt you make a large body-cloth of thick
warm Kerſey if it be in the Winter; but ſome
lighter ſtuff, as fine Cotten, for the Summer; and
fold or wrap it about the Horſes body; then girt
him with his ſaddle on, the foremoſt girt pretty
ſtrait, but the other more remiſs or ſlack:
Then put on his breaſt cloth, covering both
breaſt and ſhoulders; and let his ſtanding be
continually on good ſtore of freſh litter night
and day, of wheat ſtraw, as near as you can.
Having thus accoutred him, draw him out of
the ſtable, and back him, and walk him a foot
pace (which is called raking) a mile or two, but
neither amble nor trot him, for that will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
his celerity or ſpeed. If you can find a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſteep hills, gallop him up gently, but rack or
walk him down ſoftly, that he may cool as much
the one way as he hath heated himſelf the other:
having thus exerciſed him a pretty ſpace, walk
your Horſe to ſome River or clear Pond, fed
by ſome wholſome Spring, and there let him
drink what he pleaſeth. After this, gallop him
moderately, to warm the water in his belly;
then rack him a pretty ſpace, and then ſhow
him the water again; if he drink, gallop him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;
and thus exerciſe him ſtill, both before
and after he hath drank his water.</p>
               <p>When you have cauſed him to drink what is
enough, and exerciſed him ſufficiently; Then
bring him home gently, ſo that he have not a
wet hair. Being entred the ſtable, provoke him
to piſs by whiſtling; which you will incline him
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:44463:23"/>
to, by often ſo doing; and this you will find ſhall
add much to the Horſes health.</p>
               <p>This being done, tye up his head to the rack,
with his bridle on; then with hard wiſps with
all your might rub down his forelegs; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looſing
his breaſt cloth, with a dry courſe Cloth
rub well his head, neck, and breaſt; and having
taken off his Saddle and Body-cloth, rub his
back, and every other part of him: then cloath
him up in Linnen, and over that a good ſtrong
houſing cloth, and over that his Woolen body-Cloth;
then girting his cloaths about him, ſtop
his Surcingle round with big, thick, and ſoft
wiſps, and ſo ſhall he lye more at eaſe.</p>
               <p>Having thus cloathed your Horſe, pick his
feet, and ſtop them up with Cow-dung;
throwing into his rack a ſmall bundle of Hay,
which he ſhall tear out as he ſtandeth on his bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle.</p>
               <p>Having ſtood about an hour on his bridle,
rub then again his head all over, and the nape
of his neck with a clear rubber made of hempen
cloth; then draw his bridle, and cleanſe very
well the Manger, and put therein a quart or
ſomewhat more of dry, old, and well cleanſed
Oats: the beſt are the heavieſt and whiteſt,
ſuch as are called <hi>Poland,</hi> or the cut oats: Oats
which are moiſt ſwell the body; worms are bred
by new Oats: the black Oats, which though
they are tolerably good, yet cauſe full dung, which
hinders a mans diſcerning the ſtate of his Horſes
body. If your Horſe with a good ſtomach ſhall
eat this quart of Oats, you may give him another,
well ſifted, and ſo let him alone till eleven of the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:44463:24"/>
clock. Then come to him again and give him
another quart, well toſſed and ree'd; then cloſe
up your lights, and keep him as dark as you
can till one of the Clock. This keeping of him
in the dark, will occaſion him to lye down,
and take his reſt, whereas in the light he would
not.</p>
               <p>At one of the Clock come again, and rub his
head, face, and neck, and give him another
quart of Oats, ordered as aforeſaid; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
taken his Dung from him, leave him till
three in the Winter, and four in the Summer.</p>
               <p>At that time come again, and having wet the
bridle in beer, put it on his head, and tye him
up to the rack; then uncloath him, and dreſs
him, as before expreſſed. After dreſſing, cloath
and ſaddle him, as you did in the morning; and
leading him forth, provoke him to piſs and
dung; then mount him, and ride him as you
did before, but not to the hills, rather chuſing
ſome even and plain ground, at leaſt-wiſe make
choice of that which is moſt level. Having
choſen your ground, ride him as before, gallop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him both before and after his watering, and
then raking him gently up and down, and ſo
return home with him; and whatſoever you did
after his mornings airing, do the like after his
evenings airing.</p>
               <p>About nine of the Clock give him your laſt
viſit for that night, and firſt rub down his legs
well with hard wiſps, then with a clean Cloth
rub his head, face, and chaps, with the nape of
his neck, and fore parts, and ſo gradually his
whole body; then give him a quart of Oats well
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:44463:24"/>
ſifted, in a throughly cleanſed Manger; putting
a ſmall bundle of Hay in his rack, and toſſing up
his litter, that he may lye ſoft, leave him to his
reſt.</p>
               <p>The next morning before Sun-riſing, and
ſo every morning for a fortnight, do as you have
done this firſt morning; omitting nothing that
was done the whole day. If this you obſerve to
do, you ſhall ſo harden his fleſh, and diſſipate,
or conſume his foulneſs; that the next fortnight
you may adventure to heat him, ſo it be gently,
and with moderation.</p>
               <p>And herein you are to conſider, that two
heats in a week is ſufficient for any Horſe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.
Where note, that if your match is to
be run on a Thurſday, the fitteſt heating days are
Thurſdays and Tueſdays; ever let the one be
on the ſame day, and the other two days before;
but let the former be the ſharper heat: and let
not your heats be in rainy and foul weather;
for it is unwholſome; and therefore rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
your day.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, let not your heats be late in the Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
for it is unpleaſant to the Horſe, and of
a dangerous conſequence: but let it be early in
the morning, about Sun-riſing. So much for
the firſt fortnights obſervation: let us now
conſider what muſt be done for the ſecond.</p>

airing, watering, than was in the firſt fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night;
but now we muſt alter his diet, and
with his Oats give him bread: and by the way,
let me ſhow you how to make it.</p>
               <p>Take one part of Wheat, and three of Beans,
and mixing them together, grind them to pure
meal, then ſearce and bolt it through an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
fine range; and knead it up with good
ſtore of barm, or Yeſt, but with very little wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
be ſure you labour it well in the trough,
and then cover it warm, and let it lye ſome
while to ſwell; then knead it over again, and
make it up into good big loaves, and ſo let them
ſoak well in the Oven, and ſee that they be well
baked. Do not give your Horſe any of this
bread whilſt it is new, for it is very apt to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit;
wherefore uſe it not till it be three or four
days old: before you uſe a loaf chip it well; and
then cutting ſeveral pieces thereof, to the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of the Oats you intend to give him, mingle
the bread therewith.</p>
               <p>Between eleven and twelve give him of this
bread and oats, the ſame quantity you gave him
in the morning, and then do not viſit him till
one of the Clock; at which time you ſhall feed
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:44463:25"/>
him as in the forenoon, if you intend not to heat
him the day following; if you intend to heat
him, then give him neither bread nor hay, but
only a quart of ſweet Oats; dreſſing, cloathing,
ſaddling, airing, and watering him as before
ſhewed: and let him have his conſtant meals of
this bread and oats <hi>de die in diem,</hi> with the uſual
Ceremonies as aforeſaid; and now and then in
a morning break a new laid raw egge into his
mouth, waſhing it after with a little ſtrong Ale.</p>
               <p>Now make him acquainted with the ſtarting
Poſts; rake up your Horſe gently to the firſt poſt,
and let him ſmell to it; then rake him to the
laſt, and there let him do the like, that he may
take notice of the beginning and ending of his
Courſe. Now ſtart your Horſe roundly and
ſharply at three quarters ſpeed; and according
to his ſtrength, wind and alacrity, run him the
whole courſe through, but by no means do not
ſtrain him; and when you find him a little yield,
then eaſe him a little; ſo that what he doth may
be done freely, and with pleaſure: this will
make him take delight in his pains taking; and
ſo enable him the better to perform what is to be
expected from him.</p>
               <p>Having thus courſed your Horſe, gallop him
moderately, to recover his wind, and chear his
ſpirits; and then rake him home to his ſtall;
where having ſcraped off his ſweat, and rub'd
him well all over, give him this ſcouring which
you had before already prepared.</p>

               <p>PReſently after your Horſe hath taken this

and run his body ſlightly over with a Curry-comb,
and afterwards with the bruſh; then rub
it over again with dry cloaths, and let great
pains be taken with his head, nape of his neck,
and about his heart; then let him be cloathed
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:44463:26"/>
very warm, and wiſp him round with large
wiſps; and you may do well to throw a blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket

               <p>Let your Horſe faſt two hours after he hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

work; and thoſe humours which otherwiſe
with reſt would lye undiſturbed, are now ſtirred
and raiſed for the Phyſick to work upon, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move.</p>
               <p>After the expiration of two hours, handle his
body, the roots of his ears, fillets, flanks, and
thighs; if you find any new cold ſweat, or
that he breaths faſt and quick, then conclude
that the Medicine is ſtill ſtrugling with ſome
bad humour for the upper hand, and therefore
give him nothing; otherwiſe you may give him
an handful of wheat ears, not rough bearded;
but if you find him thus diſorder'd, leave him
in darkneſs two hours more, that he may take his
reſt.</p>
               <p>If you find after this time none of thoſe Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms,

and to theſe add two or three thick ſhives
of bread well chipt; and ſo leave him to his reſt
for three hours, or thereabout.</p>
               <p>At the Evening before dreſſing, give him the

him any water; but inſtead thereof, take three

twelve ſteps one above another, like a pair of

of the Horſe, it muſt be twice as much from the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow

it is from the top of the Hip to the ſtifling place, it

               <p>THe knowledge of the veins in an Horſe is a
ſtudy ſo needful, that he cannot be a skilful
Farrier that is ignorant herein: wherefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to my beſt ability, I ſhall indeavour to
give you an account hereof.</p>
               <p>From the Liver the fountain of all blood, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth
one large Vein, from whence cometh
theſe leſſer rivulets.</p>
               <p>Firſt, within the palate of his mouth, above
the firſt and third bars, are two conſiderable veins,
and are frequently ſtruck for diſeaſes in the head
or ſtomach: there are two which deſcend from
his eyes to his noſtrils, and are opened for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies
in the eyes. He hath alſo two very large
veins on each ſide of the Wind-pipe, and are
breathed upon any diſtemper whatſoever. He
hath likewiſe two veins which aſcend from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
his fore legs, and reſt upon the foremoſt
bough of the fore leg, which are called the
<hi>Plat-Veins;</hi> and theſe are ſtruck for foundring,
or other diſtempers in the limbs.</p>
               <p>There are two other Veins, which run down
from the Elbow of the fore ſhoulder, along the
inſides of the fore legs, and are called the <hi>Shank-Veins,</hi>
which are opened for <hi>Splents</hi> and <hi>Mallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi>
Again there are four veins which run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
the Fetlocks, and are called the <hi>Shackle-Veins;</hi>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:44463:30"/>
they are ſmall, and are often opened for
ſtiffneſs in the joints, or for tyring.</p>
               <p>He hath four veins alſo, about the Cronets in
his Hoofs, called <hi>Cronet-Veins,</hi> and are opened
for <hi>Ring-Bones.</hi> There are four Veins in his four
hoofs, called <hi>Toe-Veins,</hi> opened for frettizing
in the feet, and for foundring. From his ſtones
two great Veins deſcend along the inſide of his
Thighs, to his Cambrel, and are called <hi>Kidney-Veins,</hi>
and are opened for diſeaſes in thoſe parts.
From above the hinder Cambrel deſcend two
Veins along the inſide of the hinder legs down to
the Fetlocks, and are called the <hi>Spaven-Veins,</hi>
and are opened for the <hi>blood Spaven</hi> only. There
are two <hi>Flank-Veins,</hi> and are opened for any
malady in the <hi>Reins</hi> and <hi>Fillets;</hi> and two hinder
<hi>Hanch Veins,</hi> opened for Conſumption of the
fleſh. Laſtly, he hath one ſingle Vein in the
Tail, and is properly called the <hi>Tayl-Vein,</hi> which
is commonly opened for ſhedding of hair, or for
the Mange.</p>
               <p>There are a great many more veins which
have their derivation from theſe, but they are ſo
ſmall they are of no efficacy, and were any of
them cut, it would tend to no prejudice; but as
to theſe aforementioned, if cut, great danger
may inſue.</p>

               <p>THe Brain is acknowledged by all, to be the
Fountain, from whence Sinews have their
riſe; particularly, there is derived thence one
great Tendon, which paſſeth through the cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Neck and Back-bone, extending it ſelf to
the nethermoſt joint of the Strunt. Two ſmall
branches proceed from this main Tendon, which
paſſing through certain holes in the Horſes skull,
run down along his cheeks, even to the ſummity
of his Noſtrils. Beſides theſe there are two more
which paſs through holes in his neather chap,
knitting that and the upper together; and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
down by his great teeth, meet below his
neather lip. Moreover, there are twenty eight
ſmall threads, which running through ſo many
holes in the ſeven bones of his neck, knit them
faſt together; and thoſe which knit his Chine to
the end of his Strunt are infinite.</p>
               <p>To ſpeak of every particular ſinew would take
up too much time; wherefore, in a word, from
the ſetting on the Horſes Neck, unto the flat
Columel, or Huckle-bone doth extend one great
broad ſinew, of three inches in breadth, being
of one ſingle ſubſtance, no other ſinew having
any derivation from it; which not only holdeth
the Shoulder-Blades together; but covereth all
the Chine over; and this is commonly called
<hi>Pax</hi>-wax. Of all the principal Sinews appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

one hundred and ſeventy bones, which are
number'd thus: in the upper part of the head,
two bones, from the forehead to the noſe two,

               <head type="sub">The moſt experienced, and moſt approved
way to judge an Horſes Age, by his Teeth,
Hoofs, Tayl, Eyes, Skin, Hair, and
the Bars, or Stairs in his mouth.</head>
               <p>AS I told you before, in the Chapter of an Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
bones; an Horſe hath twelve fore Teeth,
ſix above and ſix beneath, twenty four Grin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and four Tuſhes, which make in all forty
Teeth.</p>
               <p>His Foal Teeth, for the firſt year, are only
Grinders, without Tuſhes; which are white,
ſmall, and bright; the ſecond year, the four
foremoſt Teeth change colour, and appear more
big and brown.</p>
               <p>The third year, the next Teeth unto theſe do
change alſo, and no Foal Teeth are viſible before,
but two on each ſide above, and as many below,
being both bright and ſmall. The fourth year
he hath left but two Foal-Teeth, one on each
ſide, above and below. The fifth year, his
foremoſt Teeth will all change; and then his
Tuſhes will appear compleat; and thoſe which
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:44463:32"/>
appear in the place of the laſt Foal-teeth caſt,
will be hollow, and have a little black ſpeck in
the middeſt; and this is the mark ſo much talked
on, which continueth till after eight years old.
The ſixth year beareth little difference to the
fifth: but in the ſeventh year his Teeth are at
their perfect growth; and the mark in the Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
mouth will then be plaineſt ſeen. In the eight
year, the mark will in a manner diſappear, and
vaniſh. At the ninth year his foremoſt teeth will
ſeem longer, yellower, and fowler than before;
and his Tuſhes very bluntiſh. After this year
you ſhall never certainly diſcern what age an
Horſe is by his Teeth; wherefore you muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
your ſelf to other helps: as firſt, obſerve
whether the Horſes Hoofs be rugged and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
full, dry, and ruſty, he is then for certain
ſtricken in age; whereas if his hoofs are ſmooth,
moiſt and hollow, he is undoubtedly young.</p>
               <p>Secondly, with your finger and your thumb
take your Horſe by the ſtern of the Tayl, cloſe at
the ſetting on by his Buttock; and if you find a
joint ſticking out more than any other joint, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the bigneſs of an Haſel-nut, then you may
adjudge him about ten; but if it be ſmooth in that
place, and no ſuch thing be felt, he may be eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
years old for ought you know.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, mark if his eyes be round, full, and
ſtaring from his head, and the pits filled, even
with the Temple, it is a ſign he is young; if
wrinkled under his eyes, or about his brow, he
is then old.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, pull with your fore-finger and thumb
his skin up, if it return to its place ſmooth he is
young; if otherwiſe, old.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:44463:33"/>
Fifthly, if the eye brows or main of a dark co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured
Horſe ſhall grow griſſel, he is very old.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, if the bars in his mouth feel rough and
hard, and are great and deep, then conclude
him very old; but if otherwiſe, ſoft and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
there is no fear, but that he is young and
luſty.</p>
               <p>And now we ſhall deſcend to the cure of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes,
which are twofold, internal and external;

               <head>CHAP. XVI.</head>
               <head type="sub">Of Diſeaſes in Horſes, and their cauſes.</head>
               <p>IT is not to be expected, that any man ſhould
become a Farrier, who ſhall not know, Firſt, to
what diſeaſe an Horſe is moſt inclinable. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
what are the cauſes of every diſeaſe in
particular. Thirdly, how and by what means
thoſe diſeaſes do accrew. Fourthly, the ſigns
and ſymptoms how to know and diſtinguiſh
them; and Laſtly, the means and manner how to
cure them.</p>
               <p>I ſhall inſiſt on every one of theſe in its due or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
Now firſt, touching the diſeaſes an Horſe is
moſt inclinable to; &amp; they are ſuitable to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion
or conſtitution of the Horſe: for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
if the Horſe be colured Mouſe-Dun, Cheſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut
Brown, Soot colour, or Iron-Gray, his
complexion then is melancholy, participating
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:44463:33"/>
more of earth than any other Element; by which
means he becomes dull, heavy, dogged, reſtiſe,
faint-hearted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therefore moſt inclined
to Inflammation in the Spleen, ſiccity in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
to the Dropſie, Frenzy, and the like; and ſo
may you judge of other diſeaſes by the other three
Complexions already treated of in a foregoing
Chapter.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we muſt conſider what are the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of every diſeaſe in particular: where note,
that the cauſes of ſickneſs are all unnatural effects
and evil diſpoſitions. Of theſe cauſes, there are
two ſorts, external and internal: External are
ſuch which afflict the outward parts of the body,
and the Internal the inward parts, proceeding
from ill diet, evil humours, obſtructions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sickneſs it ſelf is no more than an evil tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature,
and that is two fold, either ſimple or
compound: ſimple, when one quality is redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant,
as too cold, too hot, too moiſt, too dry;
compound, when more than one quality a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound,
as too cold and too moiſt. Some diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
are lingring, and conſume the body by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees;
as Conſumptions, Glanders; others ſhort,
and preſently mortal as ſoon as diſcovered; as
Yellows, Anticor, and Staggers: Now ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes
again do occupy the whole body; as Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
Peſtilence, Convulſions, and ſo forth; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
only ſome parts; as Colds offend the head,
Surfeits the ſtomach.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, how and by what means do theſe
accrew: the means are inbred or accidental; either
coming from ill humours, and ſurfeits, or molten
greaſe, and foulneſs by over exerciſe, and the like.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:44463:34"/>
Fourthly, of the ſigns and ſymptoms of Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
which are many, nay, almoſt innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
however, take them thus in brief. Firſt,
obſerve the place of the member grieved; and
ſee whether it have its true proportion, and is
not leſs or more in quantity; if either happen,
the Horſe is diſeaſed: next, mark the alteration
of the quality; as, whether too moiſt, too dry,
too cold, or too hot. Your third ſign may be
taken from the members non-performance of
his duty; and laſtly, by the thicker and thinner
Excrements. But theſe directions may ſeem to
ſome difficult and abſtruſe; wherefore take theſe
plainer inſtructions, which are the thirty years
obſervation of a moſt ingenious Gentleman, and
one admired by all the Horſe-Doctors in or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
this City; and thus he layeth down the
undeceivable ſigns of all ſorts of internal diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
               <p>If an Horſe be more than uſual ſlower to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
or duller to the ſpur.</p>
               <p>If he be ſhorter winded, drawing his breath
quick.</p>
               <p>If his ears hang down more than they were
wont.</p>
               <p>If his hair do briſtle, or be more ſtaring<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>If his Flanks be more than uſually lank and
hollow.</p>
               <p>If he burn betwixt his ears, or about his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterns.</p>
               <p>If travelling, his ſtomach fail him, and his
mouth dry which uſed to foam.</p>
               <p>Theſe are infallible ſigns of inward diſtemper,
as to the general; now as to ſigns of particular
diſeaſes, take theſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:44463:34"/>
If an Horſe hold down his head, whereas he
was wont to have a chearful look, it prognoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates
a Feaver, Head-ach or Foundring.</p>
               <p>That Horſe whoſe eye were naturally clear
and quick, and of a ſuddain look dull, and dim,
and heavy, is troubled either with the head-ach,
or the ſtaggers is ſeizing him.</p>
               <p>An Horſe will frequently diſcover obſtructions
in the Liver, by often turning his head to the
right ſide; and the like by turning it down to his
belly, make appear that he is troubled with the
Bots, Worms, or Cholick.</p>
               <p>Water running from an Horſes mouth, is the
ſign of a wet cough, or ſtaggers.</p>
               <p>If foul matter iſſue from an Horſes Noſtrils, it
ſignifies an Ulcer in the noſe or head; if it be
white, it is a ſign of the Glanders; if black, of
the mourning of the Chine; if yellow, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
of the Liver; if little lumps proceed
from his mouth, it ſhows the rottenneſs of his
Lungs.</p>
               <p>The beating of the Flank with ſhortneſs of
breath, is the ſign of a Feaver or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>trangle.</p>
               <p>If ought may be felt on both ſides the Forehead
beating, it is a ſign of the Staggers.</p>
               <p>Swellings about the ears betoken the Pole-evil;
under the ear, the vives; and ſwelling in the
mouth, is the ſign of the Canker, Flaps, or
Lampaſs.</p>
               <p>Swelling under the throat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſwelling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the root of the Tong<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>, is in the firſt, a
ſign of the Glanders, in the laſt, a ſign of the
Strangle; but if about the tongue roots there be
only knots or kernels, it is only a ſign of a Cold.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:44463:35"/>
If an Horſe tremble after drinking cold water,
during that time he hath a certain fit of an Ague;
for if any will obſerve it after the trembling is
over, he ſhall find him burn and glow extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p>If an Horſe piſs with much difficulty, you may
ſuſpect him either foundred, or troubled with
the Wind-Cholick or Stone; if the colour of his u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine
be yellow, it is a ſign of the Glanders; but
if thick and black, he is afflicted with pain in the
Kidneys.</p>
               <p>If Horſes Dung ſtink much it is the ſign of a
hot Liver, if little, then of a cold Liver, and if
undigeſted, then of a Conſumption, or ſome dry
Malady.</p>
               <p>If an Horſe deſire extremely to lie down on
his right ſide, he is troubled with a hot Liver;
if on the left, it is the ſign of a diſtemper'd Spleen;
if he tumble to and fro, taking no reſt, then he
is troubled with Worms, Bots, or Wind-cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick;
if not able to riſe when down, it betokens
mortal weakneſs, or foundring in the body.</p>
               <p>If an Horſe covet much meat and little drink,
it betokens a cold Liver; but if he thirſt much,
and eat little, then it denotes a Feaver, rotten
Lungs, an extraordinary heat in the ſtomach, or
the dry Yellows.</p>
               <p>If an Horſe ſtrike with his foot at his belly, it
ſignifies the Cholick, or Griping of the Guts;
but if he fisks with his Tayl when he ſtrikes, then
it is Bots or Worm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>If a knotty Ulcer creep along the Veins, it is the
Farcy; if expanding it ſelf only in one place,
it is a Canker; if the Ulcer be hollow and crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

it is a Fiſtula; but if it be a ſpungy wart, and

theſe rules.</p>
               <p>Firſt, let what ever potion or drench you give
your Horſe be but luke-warm, for it is of a moſt
dangerous and deadly conſequence if you ſcald
an Horſes ſtomach.</p>

Thirdly, draw out your Horſes tongue a little
before you clap the horn into his mouth, and
then let it ſlip in again, and that will force him to
ſwallow what he hath received.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, if you will have your phyſick work
well, keep your Horſe faſting, a good while,
both before and after the reception thereof; and
uſe him to moderate exerciſe for the better ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
as walking or trotting him, as you ſhall
find him furniſhed with ſtrength.</p>

               <p>Secondly, if the diſeaſe hath its riſe from cold
cauſes, as Coughs, Rheums, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then mingle
your ſimples with Wine, or good Ale.</p>

               <p>PHlebotomy, or Blood-letting, is either to
prevent diſeaſes, and ſo preſerve health, or
to refrigerate the ſpirits, or elſe, to take away
blood where there is too much, or elſe to void
and purge groſs and foul humours.</p>
               <p>In phlebotomy, you are to obſerve this, firſt,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:44463:36"/>
to chaſe or exerciſe him moderately; then let
him reſt a day before you draw blood from him,
and three days after.</p>
               <p>If you find the vein to ſwell after you have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
it, (as it will do when wind gets in, or when
a ſteam miſcarries) then take white Pitch, black
Pitch, and Roſſin, of each a like quantity, and
boyl them together, and lay it on with a flat ſtick,
and then flock it; let it lye all over the ſwelling,
and anoint it with the Oyl of Populeon; once do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this commonly effects the cure; but if once
doth it not, then uſe it oftner, till you have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſt
the ſwelling.</p>
               <p>If your Horſe bleed violently at the noſe, and
you cannot ſtanch it, then take Betony, and
ſtamp it in a Morter with ſalt, and put it into
the Horſes noſe: or if your Horſe be wounded,
and bleedeth exceedingly, the ſame applied there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
will immediately ſtop the flux of blood.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of the Excrements of an Horſe.</head>
               <p>THe Excrements of an Horſe are of two ſorts,
Dung and Urine.</p>
               <p>If the Dung of your Horſe be of the colour, or
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:44463:37"/>
ſomewhat near of his food, he is in a ſound con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition:
as for example, if an Horſe runs at graſs,
his dung will be green; if it be bright, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
too hard nor too ſoft, it is an excellent ſign
of an healthy conſtitution; but if it be fluid and
wateriſh, though it be green, it betokens the
Horſe troubled with coldneſs in his ſtomach and
bowels.</p>
               <p>If the Dung be neither too thick nor too thin,
yet the greenneſs intermixt with blackneſs, it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
the Horſe inclined to the Yellows or Stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</p>
               <p>If the food of an Horſe be ſtraw, the colour of
his Dung will be a bright yellow, and rather
thick than thin; the grain whereof being long,
it is a ſign of health; but if the Dung be reddiſh,
and either very dry, or as thin as Cow-dung,
they are infallible ſigns that the Horſe is inwardly
diſeaſed: if this redneſs do turn to blackneſs, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
loſt its ſcent, it betokens the ſpeedy death of
the creature.</p>
               <p>If Hay and Provender be the uſual food of your
Horſe, if healthy and ſound, the colour of his
dung will be a browniſh-yellow, moiſt, and of
a grain ſomewhat long; but if that brownneſs
turn to redneſs, it is a ſign of ſickneſs; if to black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
then of death.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, if your Horſe feed altogether on Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vender,
then will his dung be of a pale yellow
colour, if he be in health; but if it look reddiſh,
then it ſignifieth that the Horſe hath taken ſome
inward heat, and that there is an inflammation
in his bowels and ſtomach. Now if it be brown,
and ſhiny, or greaſy and ſhining, it is a ſign of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:44463:37"/>
molten greaſe putrefying in the body. Thus
much of an Horſes Dung, now of his Urine.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, if it be of a pale yellow, or
ſtraw colour, ſmelling ſtrong, and not very clear,
then is your Horſe healthy, well, and luſty; but
if its colour be very white, it is a ſign of weakneſs
in the Reins, Stone and Obſtruction in the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys.</p>
               <p>If the Urine be high coloured like Beer brew'd
with over dryed Malt, then is that Horſes blood
inflamed, ſignifying a Feaver, or ſome great ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit;
if blood red, an heat by over riding, whoſe
inflammation is ſo great, that if ſcowring, or
ſome other phyſical means be not ſpeedily uſed,
the Horſe will fall irrecoverably into ſome mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
diſtemper.</p>
               <p>If the Urine be pale and greeniſh, it is a ſign of
a Conſumption of the ſeed, and debilitation of
the back.</p>
               <p>If the Urine be high coloured, yet clowdy and
blackiſh, it foretells ſpeedy mortality.</p>

                  <p>The Symptoms of this Feaver are the violent

                  <p>The old way to cure him is to open the great
Vein in his hinder Haunch, about four Inches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low

                  <p>A Winter Feaver is of long continuance,
though not very dangerous; the cauſes and ſigns

it is required, that you purge his head well, by

As for his diet, keep him faſting a good while

a pan of Coals near the Ointment, to make
it ſink in, rubbing hard againſt the Hair: but as

this.</p>

               <p>The powder of Gum-Dragacanth, Euſens, and

againſt Winter or Summer Feavers. Garlick
ſtalks broke into little pieces, and with Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kincenſe

For any obſtructions or cold in his head, there is
nothing better than a rag anointed with Oyl <hi>de</hi>

you may. For the Glanders, anoint two feathers
with Oyl <hi>de</hi> Bay, Euphorbium, and white Elle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore,

For any Cephalick diſtemper, but eſpecially the

               <p>If at any time (according to the former ſigns
and ſymptoms,) you find your Horſe not well,
open his Neck-Vein, taking from him a good
quantity of blood, then faſting, give him three
mornings together, half an Ounce of Diapente
well brewed in a pint of Muſcadine; which Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pente
you ſhall make after this manner. Take
Gentian, Ariſtolochia, Bay-berries, Myrrh, and
the ſhavings of Ivory, of each a like quantity,
beat them into very fine powder, and ſearce it.
I ſay, having given him of this powder, then
ride him abroad an hour, and then give him what
he will eat; at Noon give him a ſweet Maſh, and
at night with a courſe Rubber rub him well
all over, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <div type="part">
                  <head>Avives.</head>
                  <p>Avives is a French appellation for this diſeaſe;
and is corruptly called by Engliſh Farriers the
Fives or Vives.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="70" facs="tcp:44463:43"/>
Its growth is under the ears, deſcending down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
towards the Throat, with inflammation
and ſwelling; this diſeaſe is dangerous, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
mortal; for this ſwelling will ſtop his wind,
and choak him, if not timely prevented.</p>
                  <p>The cauſes of this diſtemper are great heats and
rankneſs of blood.</p>
                  <p>The cure you may effect this one way, which
is worth all the reſt I have read of.</p>
                  <p>Take a penny worth of fine Pepper, beaten to
fine powder, a ſpoonful of Swines greaſe, the
juice of an handful of Rue, two ſpoonfuls of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar;
mix them well together, and put it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
into both the Horſes Ears, and tye them up
with two ſtrings, ſhaking the Ear ſo that the
Medicine may ſink downward; this done, let
him blood in the Neck-Vein, and Temple-Veins,
and you need not queſtion the cure of your
Horſe.</p>

               <div type="part">
                  <head>Anticor.</head>
                  <p>The nature of this diſeaſe agreeth with its
name, for by reaſon of immoderate riding, or
too hard feeding without exerciſe, the Horſes
blood becometh corrupted and inflamed, taking
up its reſidence in and about the heart; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
not ſpeedy vent is the cauſe of ſuddain
death.</p>
                  <p>You may know this diſeaſe by this ſign; juſt
againſt the heart there will be a ſwelling, in the
middle of the breaſt: before the ſwelling doth
appear, the ſigns will be theſe; he will groan very
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:44463:43"/>
much when laid down, hanging down his head
he will refuſe to eat.</p>
                  <p>Immediately upon the appearance of the ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
open both the Plate-Veins, or take away a
good quantity of blood from both ſides of his
Neck; having done this, give him a Drink of
Diapente with Ale, putting thereto an Ounce of
brown Sugar-Candy, and half an Ounce of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
Treacle, which will expel the grief from his
heart; after this anoint the ſwelling with Hogs
greaſe, Bores Greaſe, and Baſilicon, of each
three Ounces; incorporate theſe well together,
and rub the ſwelling every day therewith, till it
come to ſuppuration or ſoftneſs; then by open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it let out the matter; then waſh your ſore
with Coperas water, which you ſhall make
thus: take two quarts of fair Water, and adde
thereto half a pound of green Copperas, with an
handful of Salt; and put theſe into a Poſnet,
with a ſpoonful of Honey, and a branch of Roſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary;
boyl theſe together till one half of the
liquor be conſumed; a little before you take it
off the fire, put to it the quantity of a Wall-nut
of Allum; then let it cool, and preſerve it for
your uſe.</p>
                  <p>Having waſht the ſore clean with this water,
then apply thereunto this Oyntment; put into a
clean Skillet, of Roſſin the quantity of a Wall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut,
being molten, add thereto the like quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Wax; and when that is melted put there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
half a Pound of Hogs greaſe tryed; and
that being melted, put in a ſpoonful of Engliſh
Honey; and when theſe are melted, and well
ſtirred together, put thereunto half a pound of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:44463:44"/>
ordinary Turpentine; this being diſſolved, take
it from the fire; then adde of Verdegreaſe fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pulverized one Ounce; and ſo ſtir them all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
then ſet it on the fire, and let it ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
but if it boyl it is utterly ſpoiled; then
ſtrain it, and when cold, preſerve it for your
uſe. This Ointment is of excellent Vertue to
cure old Ulcers, Fiſtulas, but more eſpecially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

                  <head>Bots or Worms in Horſes.</head>
                  <p>It is the opinion of the moſt judicious, that
there are three ſorts of Worms which breed in
the Bowels of an Horſe: Firſt, Bots, being
ſhort Worms with great red heads, and long,
ſmall, white tails; next, Truncheons, which
are ſhort and thick, being all of a bigneſs; and
the laſt are as big as a mans finger, and ſix inches
long, and are only called Worms. Mr. <hi>Mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
by experience hath found out a fourth ſort,
which are of a middle ſize, and are red and fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
with thick, ſhort, ſharp heads, and are of
all others moſt dangerous; for ſometimes they
will get up to his very throat, and choak him,
ſometimes eat through his very Stomach, and
kill him.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Worms do proceed from a raw, groſs,
and Phlegmatick matter, ingendred by foul feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>The ſigns are; the Horſe will refuſe his meat,
&amp; will be much addicted to lying down, &amp; rowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on his belly, beating it ſometimes with his
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:44463:44"/>
feet: if troubled with the Red Worms, his pain
will be intollerable, ſo that he will beat his head
againſt the ground.</p>
                  <p>Some approve of this as an excellent remedy;
take the warm guts of a new killed Hen, and
mixing them with Salt, thruſt them down the
Horſes throat; this muſt be done three mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
faſting, withholding him from water four
hours after; or elſe give him to drink a ſpoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of Soap in a Pint of Milk; or laſtly, take of
Gentian, Aloes, and Savin, of each half an
Ounce, and brew them together with Honey
and ſtrong Ale.</p>
                  <p>But if it be a Mare with foal, give nothing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally
for fear of killing her Colt; only let her
blood in the roof of her mouth, and make her
ſwallow her own blood, which will not only
kill the Worms, but help moſt internal Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>

                  <head>Blood-ſtaling.</head>
                  <p>An Horſe many times inſtead of Urine, will
void pure blood, which is occaſioned often times
by labouring over much; and by that means
breaking a Vein; then will there iſſue from his
Yard pure blood, without any other commix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
but if the Blood be mingled with Urine,
then it proceeds from the Kidneys, wounded
with a ragged Stone therein: but Mr. <hi>Markham</hi>
is clearly of the opinion, that there is no greater
cauſe of Blood-ſtaling, than the taking up of an
Horſe in the dead of Winter from Graſs, and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:44463:45"/>
without a days reſpite, riding him a long jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</p>
                  <p>The ſigns are ſo apparent, that we will paſs
them, and fall upon the Cure; and in the firſt
place, it will be proper to phlebotomize him in the
Palate of the mouth, or in the Neck; and let the
blood be ſodden with Wheat, and with the
powder of dryed Pomegranat pills; having ſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
it, give him hereof four or five mornings to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
and in the ſpace of time let him not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
by any means.</p>
                  <p>Or, take a quart of ſtrong Ale and a red Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
cut it into ſmall peices, and let it lye ſteep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Ale, then give it the Horſe with an
Horn, and it will ſtop the inward bleeding of
the Horſe.</p>
                  <p>Otherwiſe, you may take a ſpoonful of Tara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,
and ſteep it in White-Wine, and as much
Poppy ſeed beaten as will lye on a Shilling; give
this faſting in the White-Wine, and it is an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
cure.</p>

                  <head>Blowing and Purſiveneſs in an Horſe.</head>
                  <p>Many Horſes are naturally thick winded, by
reaſon of their being Cock-throppled and narrow
chawled; but moſt frequently it is ſo by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;
as when he is fat and over-laden with fleſh,
by rankneſs of blood, or by too much foulneſs in
the body; and by theſe means will upon any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
ſweat, pant, blow, and heave at the
Flanks.</p>
                  <p>To the intent wherefore you may prevent his
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:44463:45"/>
being broken winded, in time apply your ſelf
to the cure; and let it be in this manner.</p>
                  <p>Let him feed moderately on Hay, (for Horſes
ſo diſeaſed are greedy Feeders) and let the Hay
be always ſprinkled with water, which will aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwage
his thirſt, and very much cool his inflamed
blood; then give him two Egges ſteeped twenty
four hours in the ſtrongeſt White-Wine-Vinegar
five or ſix mornings following, and let him
ſwallow the Vinegar afterwards; then ride him
gently an hour after, then ſet him up warm, and
three hours after give him Hay ſprinkled with
Water, and at night give him Oats, wetted in
good ſtrong Ale; do this ten days, keeping him
the while to ſpare diet, and let his drink be white
Water.</p>
                  <p>This Medicine will both purge and ſcowre
from him much flegm and filth at Noſe and
mouth; and if moderately exerciſed, will be

as you can reach, which is called Raking an

Agarick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> you muſt not exceed the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of three ounces at moſt in one Clyſter, and
of Butter not four ounces; and let your Clyſter
be never more than lukewarm. Before he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it let him be ſomewhat empty, by raking,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and let him retain it half an hour; and for
the better effecting thereof, let his keeper hold
his Tail cloſe to his Tuel, for the ſpace or time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid;
the longer it is kept in, the more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
it will be to him: obſerve to draw away

                  <p>If the Liver be troubled with many diſeaſes,
ſo is the Gall; which is a long ſlender little

which receiveth all the Cholerick bitter moiſture,
which would otherwiſe not only be offenſive to
the Liver, but likewiſe the whole body. Now
if the paſſage of this neceſſary Veſſel be ſtopped,
there will certainly follow many diſeaſes; as the

of the Bladder of the Gall, down into the Guts

with too much Choler; hence proceedeth Suffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,

                  <p>Laſtly, he is then frantick indeed, when the

its office, whereby he loſeth his ſtrength in ſuch
manner, that he can neither go, nor bow his

An Horſe that is Feaveriſh may be known by
his ſuddainly falling ill, his heavineſs and gaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his Belly; when it firſt ſeizeth him, he will
quake exceedingly.</p>
                  <p>The Cure: Take half an Ounce of Diapente,
one Ounce of Bay-berries, half an Ounce of
long Pepper; beat theſe together; then take
half an Ounce of Diaſcordium, and put all theſe
into a Pint and half of ſtrong Beer, and making
it luke-warm, give him it any time of the day
to drink, but take no blood from him in any
caſe, it is death if you do; only cloath and litter
him warm; the Diaſcordium will cauſe him to
ſleep: Now after the Drink hath done working,
and the Horſe left off ſweating, then give him
half a Pint of White-Wine and two Ounces of
Honey, mixt together, and made luke-warm;
then air him, and four hours after give him a
Cordial, made of three pints of ſtale Beer, and a
quarter of a Pint of Honey, and a quarter of a
pound of Butter, and a good piece of Houſhold
bread; boyl them a little together, and give it
him luke-warm; and ſo ſet him up for that
night.</p>
                  <p>Next morning faſting, give him the Cordial
again, and at ten of the Clock give him warm
Water and Bran, at three of the Clock White-Wine
and Honey, and at night warm Water

and as you ſee him mend, you may air
him oftner; at which time take ſome blood

for the Water coming thereunto cauſeth
it to ſwell, whereby crudities are bred in the

                  <p>It proceeds ſometimes from too ſoon travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:44463:56"/>

Impoſtume, engendred either by cold, over much
faſting, or long thirſt, or by eating foul meat, or
elſe by infection of other Horſes.</p>
                  <p>It is a Flux or Rheum, which ſometimes run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
at one Noſtril, ſometimes at both: now,
he that would perfectly cure this diſeaſe, muſt
conſider the matter which iſſueth from the Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
Noſe. If the humour be clear and tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
then it is not very dangerous; if white, it
is worſe, yet with no great difficulty cured. If
it be yellow, it is infectious, yet curable; and
therefore ſeparate him from your ſound Horſes.
If that yellow be mixed with red, or if the colour
of the matter be like Saffron, the Horſe is in a
manner incurable.</p>
                  <p>He ought to conſider whether the matter
hath an evil ſmell, if ſo, it is the ſign of an
Ulcer; if it ſtink not at all it is a certain ſign of
death.</p>
                  <p>To facilitate his cure you muſt give him warm
Maſhes of Malt and Water, with purging his
head by ſneezing; you may then give him any of
theſe ſeveral drinks.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, you may take a pottle of Urine, an
handful of Bay Salt, and a good quantity of
brown Sugar-Candy, then boyl it to a quart;
after this, adde Anniſeeds and Liquoriſh beaten
to fine powder, and give it him blood-warm to
drink.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, you may take Swines Greaſe, and
boyl it in Water; then take the fat from the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and mingle it with a little Oyl Olive, and
a good quantity of Urine, and half as much
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:44463:56"/>
White-Wine, when it is luke-warm give him a
quart thereof to drink.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, take a quart of Ale, an Ounce and
half of grated bread, the Yolks of two Egges,
of Ginger, Saffron, Cloves, Cinamon, Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>megs,
Cardamomum, Lavender, Galingal,

mix theſe together, ſtrain it, and give it him to

                  <p>But if the Glaunders be of the worſer ſort,
which will be known by the aforeſaid Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms;
then take half a pound of Swines Blood,
adde to it a pound of the juice of Beets, with
three Ounces of Euphorbium finely beaten; and
when it hath boyled ſome time, take it off from

keep this Oyntment, and anoint

blood let him in in the Neck-veins, on both

                  <head>Loathing of meat in an Horſe.</head>
                  <p>This is a diſeaſe proceeding from the intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature
of his Stomach, occaſioned by rank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of blood, or overmuch travel. Dayly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
makes this latter apparent; for if an
Horſe be ridden hard, and put up into a Stable
hot, he will refuſe his meat; and hence it is
that I cannot but condemn baiting at Noons (a
vulgar ignorant cuſtom) becauſe a journey com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
craves haſte, ſo that an Horſe is not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to take ſo convenient a cooling as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite,
before his meat, which breeds many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers.</p>
                  <p>Now to cool him moderately, either waſh his
tongue with Vinegar, or give him to drink Oyl
and Vinegar mingled with cold water.</p>
                  <p>But if the loathing of his meat proceed from
the coldneſs of his Stomach, which is only
known by the ſtanding up and ſtovering of the
hair; then give him Wine and Oil to drink,
mixed, divers mornings together; or Wine,
Oil, Sage, and Rice boiled together, giving him
thereof a quart at a time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="106" facs="tcp:44463:61"/>
Some again will give him Onions, pilled and
chopt, and Rocket-ſeed boiled and bruiſed in
Wine; others mingle Wine with the blood of a
Sow-Pig.</p>
                  <p>But to conclude: Take this as the beſt reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
for any general forſaking, or an Horſe's
loathing his meat, whether it proceed from hot
or cold cauſes in the Stomach; and that is, when
there are green Blades of Corn, eſpecially of
Wheat, give your Horſe a good quantity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
if it be at ſuch a time, as that they cannot
be procured, then give the Horſe ſweet Wine,
and the ſeeds of Gith mixt with it, or elſe ſweet
Wine and Garlick, well pilled and ſtampt, brew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it a good while together; this is a ſovereign
remedy in maladies of this nature.</p>

an Horſes Body, which, if not in its due time
ſtayed, will bring the Horſe to great debilitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and weakneſs; this diſeaſe proceedeth from
very many cauſes; wherefore I ſhall paſs them
over, and only inform you, that as you muſt
have a care not to ſtop it too ſoon, ſo let it not
run too long; both being of an equal dangerous
conſequence. As long as you find the ſtrength
and good eſtate of your Horſe continue, you may
let him ſcowre, but when once that begins to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair,
you muſt put a ſtop to its farther courſe;
which you may do ſeveral ways.</p>
                  <p>As firſt; take of Bean-flower and Bole Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niack,
of each a quartern, mix them together
with a quart of red Wine; give it him luke-warm,
but be ſure to keep him warm, and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:44463:61"/>
expoſe him to no labour for ſome ſmall
time.</p>
                  <p>Or ſecondly, you may take an handful of an
herb called Shepherds-purſe, and boil it in a
quart of ſtrong Ale; then take the ſeeds of
Woodroof ſtampt, and when the Ale is luke-warm,
put them thereinto and give it the Horſe
to drink. Let his drink in this mean while be
warmed, mingled with Bean-flower, but give
him not his full draught at a time, and when you
give him any, let it be but once in eighteen
hours.</p>
                  <p>Others, and not unadviſedly, take the powder
of one Nutmeg, half an ounce of Cinamon, and
as much of the rind of a Pomegranat, and mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
theſe with a pint of red Wine, give it the
Horſe luke-warm to drink.</p>
                  <p>But if this Diſeaſe happen to a ſucking Foal,
as it is frequently ſeen, by reaſon of the fluidneſs
of his Diet; then give him a pint of Verjuice,
which curdling the Milk, will thicken his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement,
and is, I can experimentally aſſure, a
ſpeedy Remedy.</p>
                  <p>Now as to the Bloody Flux, it is undoubtedly
occaſioned by ſome ſharp humour excoriating
the Guts, or from ſome exulceration there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
                  <p>The ſigns of this diſtemper are very apparent,

four ounces of the Conſerve of Sloes, in a
pint of red Wine, and ſo with your Horn give
it him to drink: but the moſt approved Remedy
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:44463:62"/>
in this; take half an handful of Shepherds-purſe,
and as much Tanners Bark, taken out of the Fat

but if the ſeaſon will permit, his beſt food will

                  <p>This is a diſtemper which very much afflicteth
Horſes, as well as Mankind, ſeizing both ſo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently,
that the breath will be ſo ſtopt, that it
will cauſe a ſtruggling and a ſtriving, ſo that an
exceſſive ſweat and faintneſs will follow.</p>
                  <p>It comes only in the Night, and it proceeds
from Crudities, and ill digeſtion; whoſe ill va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours
do not only diſturb the head, but likewiſe
all the ſenſitive parts.</p>
                  <p>The ſigns are, coming to your Horſe in the

drop driving the other, panting, and ſweating,
principally in his Flanks, Neck, and roots of the
Ears.</p>
                  <p>The Cure is, Mornings and Evenings, both
before and after Water, to give him a good
moderate exerciſe, and having brought him
into the Stable, rub him well down, giving
him Oats, mixed with an handful of Hemp-ſeed.</p>
                  <p>Now by the way, take notice that there are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                  </p>
                  <p>As all theſe Diſtempers proceed from one cauſe,

                  <head>Purgations, their nature and manner of Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration.</head>
                  <p>There are five ſeveral ways by which an Horſe
may be purged; Firſt, by Pills and they are princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
for the head, drawing down all peccant
humours from thence into the body; and carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them off with the Excrements. Secondly,
Potions, which do cleanſe the Stomach, Belly and
Guts, throwing off all ill humours, which are
there offenſive. Thirdly, Clyſters, and they are
of ſeveral ſorts; ſome to bind, ſome to looſen,
ſome to heal Ulcers, and others to mitigate the
ſharpneſs of peccant humours. Fourthly, Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitories,
which are more mild and gentle than
your Clyſters are, and may be adminiſtred when
they cannot.</p>
                  <p>Now it is very requiſite, that the expert Farri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
know how to make choice of his Ingredients;
and when gotten, how to compound them; and
laſtly, for what diſeaſes or maladies they are moſt
applicably proper; and that you may not be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of the nature of ſome Simples, know that
Colliquintida, Scammony, and Elebore are
ſtrong; Manna, Caſſia, and Prunes are more
gentle; thoſe which hold a mediocrity in their
operation, are Rhubarb, Agarick, Aloes, and
Sena.</p>
                  <p>Now there is a fifth way of purgation, and
that is by Graſs; that which will ſcowr moſt is a
new mown Meadow; for that will not only
rake his guts, but keep him from gathering fleſh;
and therefore it will not be prudence to ſuffer him
to run there above twelve or thirteen days, and
then away with him to ſome other Graſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:44463:64"/>
by thy Sithe, and in a little time he will
belly and recover fleſh.</p>
                  <p>But as for Purgations in the Stable you muſt
heedfully follow their precepts, who have travail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
far in this Art and Myſtery; and firſt of all,
the Seaſons of the year muſt be duly conſidered.
For if you are to give your Horſe in Winter a
purge, you muſt firſt prepare him by breathing
a Vein, keeping him in a day or two from feeding
on any meats that are hard of concoction, as
Hay or Straw. To this intent therefore, let his
meat be (for three or four days before) Wheat or
Rye Bran prepared, Beans, Peaſe or Oats well
ſifted, and let him take his purgation faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>If you will purge away his ill humours engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
by ſurfeits, filth and ſlime, then take a pint
of White-Wine, or a quart of ſtrong Ale, and
put herein as much of the powder of the beſt Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choacan
as will lye on a ſhilling at four times;
having given him this luke-warm, trot him out
a Mile or more, and having ſtood upon the Trench
till noon; give him a warm Maſh.</p>
                  <p>Whether in Summer or Winter, if you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
your Horſe ſurfeited, full of colds, or ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
indiſpoſed; firſt, phlebotomizing him,
give him a purge in this manner. Take two
Ounces of Aloes Succotrina pulverized, and
with ſweet butter make it up into Pills; give
them to him over night, having faſted the day
before, and the next morning give him a ſweet
Maſh, which will make the Pills work the more
kindly, and ſo let him faſt till towards the Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
and in that time they will clear his body
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:44463:65"/>
wonderfully; ſome Horſes are of ſo ſtrong a
conſtitution, they will not purge till the ſecond
day, and therefore be careful in the mean time
how you order him.</p>
                  <p>When you think he hath done purging, give
him a ſweet Maſh, then Oats and Bran, and for
all night Hay ſprinkled with Water.</p>
                  <p>If you will purge the body of an Horſe newly
taken from Graſs; firſt rake him, and then give
him this Clyſter.</p>
                  <p>Take of Mallows three handfuls, Marſh-Mallow
roots cleanſed and bruiſed, and Violet leaves of each
two handfuls, Flax ſeed three ſpoonfuls, ſo many of
the Cloves of white Lilly roots, as you may eaſily hold
in your hand; boyl all theſe from a Gallon to a Wine
quart; then ſtrain it, and put thereto of Sena one
Ounce, infuſing it in the liquor three hours over the
Embers, and put thereunto an half pint of Saliet-Oyl,
which being blood-warm, adminiſter Clyſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
                  <p>The next day after give him this drink; Take
a quart of the ſtrongeſt Ale wort, a quarter of a
pint of ordinary Honey, two Ounces of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
Treacle, mix and brew all together very
well.</p>
                  <p>There are ſeveral other ſorts of purgations,
which for brevity ſake I ſhall omit, referring you
to the ingenious indeavours of Mr. <hi>Thomas Grey</hi>

                  <p>But Mr. <hi>Markham</hi> by his own experience finds
nothing for this diſtemper more ſoveraign, than
to take a quart of ſtrong Ale, and put it into a

will fill up the pot; then ſtopping the pot very

                  <p>You need no ſymptoms, they are ſo apparent;

                  <p>It is one thing for an Horſe to be ſaid he is <hi>rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,</hi>

for to be internally rotten is incurable, but to have
the Rot is to be afflicted with the Dropſie, or

                  <p>This diſeaſe happens to Horſes frequently ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:44463:67"/>

                  <p>The method of the cure muſt be firſt, to bleed

with the Sweat and Milk; mix theſe well toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

one thereof each morning, but let him not drink

them, give him after this the green blades of

                  <p>The Strangury or Strangullion is, when the
Horſe hath great inclination to ſtale, and yet
cannot void his Urine, unleſs it be by drops. It
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:44463:67"/>
commonly proceeds either from ſharpneſs of the
Urine occaſioned by over much travail, or elſe
by exulceration of the Bladder, or finally, ſome
Apoſthume in the Liver and Kidneys; which
breaking, and the matter falling into the Bladder,
the ſharpneſs thereof cauſeth a continual deſire to
piſs without ability.</p>
                  <p>For his Cure, bathe the Horſes hinder loins
with warm water, then take bread and Bay-ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
and tempering them with <hi>May</hi> Butter,
convey down his throat two balls thereof for
three mornings together; or take a quart of new
Milk, and a quartern of Sugar, and brewing
them well together, give the Horſe to drink
thereof five mornings together.</p>
                  <p>Otherwiſe, make a ſtrong Decoction by boyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  <p>Though in the Title I ſeem to treat generally
of Surfeits, yet I ſhall ſpeak in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar;
and firſt of that inward dry Surfeit which
cauſeth the Cods to ſwell, either continually, or
betwixt whiles; to the intent therefore that you
may arrive at the Cure, mind theſe following
Inſtructions.</p>
                  <p>You muſt firſt purge your Horſe after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
Take an ounce of fine Aloes, which glitters,
for that is the beſt, then pulverize it or beat it to
powder; then take three ounces of freſh Butter,
mix theſe two well together, and add thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſo much Wheat-bran as is ſufficient to make
it into a Paſte, and make thereof five or ſix Balls;
then convey one of them as far into his mouth
as you may, that he may the better ſwallow it,
giving him an hornful of ſtrong Ale to waſh it
down; then give him a ſecond, a third, a fourth
and the fifth, ſtill interlining them with an horn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of Beer or Ale, to waſh them down; after
this, ride him out for an hour gently, then ſet
him up warm: keep him faſting ſix hours after
he hath taken his Pills, giving him ſome Hay at
night, and not before, with warm water to drink;
and the like the next day.</p>
                  <p>But the third day, after his purgation is over,
give him cold water, and immediately after it
two ounces of Honey, and half a pint of white
Wine a little warmed, for that will make him
ſtale, clearing his Bladder, and procuring an
appetite; then air him gently for an hour and
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:44463:70"/>
an half, doing thus morning and evening till he
be well.</p>
                  <p>But if what you have given him, do neither
ſharpen his ſtomach nor purge him; then take
three pints of ſtale Beer, three ounces of courſe
houſhold bread, mixing them together, and
ſetting them over the fire; being well boil'd
take it off, and put therein a quarter of a pound
of Honey, and three ounces of freſh Butter, give
him theſe blood-warm, and ride him moderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a mile afterwards; then ſet him up warm,
and let him ſtand upon the Trench about two
hours after it: then give him a Maſh of ſodden
Oats till they burſt with warm water and Wheat-bran
therein; this in twice or thrice giving
will procure him a ſtomach, and render him la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xative
withal.</p>
                  <p>Now if his Cods be ſwell'd, occaſioned by
this Surfeit; as ſoon as his Purge hath done
working, take the charge of Sope and Brandy,
and with a ſtick dabb it on his Cods (or other
ſwelling proceeding from the ſame cauſe) as it
comes boiling from the fire; do this but once,
and four days after ride him into a River, againſt
the ſtream, ſo deep that he is ready to ſwim, for
near a quarter of an hour, thus uſing him once
or twice a day, till you find his ſwelling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate.</p>
                  <p>If it be a dry Surfeit, give the Purge firſt, and
afterwards the Cordial, made of white Wine
and Honey; but if he run at Noſtrils, give him
a Drink made of Anniſeeds, Turmerick, Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
Vinegar and Beer, and three days after let
him have the Purge: in like manner do if his
Greaſe be melted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="125" facs="tcp:44463:70"/>
This aforementioned Purge and Cordial are
not only good againſt any dry Surfeit, but
alſo for melted Greaſe, ſet and dried in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and legs ſwelled, or when an Horſe is Gaunt,
Gut-foundred and coſtive.</p>
                  <p>There is another ſort of Surfeit, which is
moiſt, hot and running, that from the Body falls
into either fore-legs, hind-legs, or ſometimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all four.</p>
                  <p>It proceeds from colds and heats, occaſioned
ſeveral ways, and the diſtemper is very trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
and loathſome, however not very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
to be cured, if you will obſerve this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, let him blood in the Neck-veins, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you do it, keep him faſting moſt part of the
night before; having let him bleed freely, give
him a drink made thus:</p>
                  <p>Take of Ariſtilochia one ounce, of Turmerick
one ounce, of Anniſeeds dry one ounce; beat the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſeeds
and Turmerick ſmall, and grate the roots
of Ariſtolochia; put theſe together with one hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of Rew, and one handful of Wormwood, and one
handful of red Sage, one handful of green Fennel,
or two ounces of the ſeeds thereof; then let all theſe
ſteep together in three pints of water all night.</p>
                  <p>Now before you give him hereof, ride him out
a mile or two, to warm him a little, and then
give him this water as it ſtood cold all night,
then ride him a mile more, and after this let him
ſtand ſix hours on the bit; then give him a little
Hay, and after that warm water and Bran: he
muſt not drink but once a day, riding him two
or three miles after it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="126" facs="tcp:44463:71"/>
At the expiration of three days, give him the
ſame drink, uſing him as you did before in every
circumſtance; obſerving ſo to do every third day,
till you have exſiccated or dried up thoſe humours
which are ſo offenſive to him.</p>

                  <p>If an Horſe be troubled with any obſtruction

remedy than this: Take half a pint of white
Wine, and infuſe therein all night an handful of
Nettle-ſeeds, with one ounce of Ivy-berries beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en

him cold, then ride him for an hour moderately,
and after that tie him to the rack three or four

                  <p>The ſpeedieſt cure is to take one ounce of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſeeds,

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:44463:71"/>
half a quartern of Brandy, a quarter of

put theſe into a Poſnet, and only heat them
blood-warm, and give it him faſting, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
after he hath taken it, run the point of
the Cornel-horn into the third Furrow of the

walk him a mile, and ſet him up; be ſure you
litter him well, and keep him warm, for he
will ſweat exceſſively; give him only warm wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
with Wheat-bran therein; the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the like, and then ſuddenly after give him
half a pint of white Wine, and two ounces and
an half of Honey; then walk him as before.
The third day in the morning, after he hath
ſwallowed his aforeſaid Drink, give him this
Cordial, which you may make thus: Take three
pints of ſtrong Beer, ſomewhat ſtale, a good
piece of Houſhold-bread, and crum it therein,
four ounces of Butter; put theſe into a skillet

off, put in four ounces of Honey; ſtir them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
well, and give it him, faſting, luke warm,
then ride him a mile, afterwards ſet him up and
let him be well littered. In the time of his
Cure, ride him twice or thrice a day moderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

ſo to diſguize the Horſe that the right owner
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:44463:72"/>
ſhould not know his own goods: thus, I have
been informed, they make this Star: with a pair of
Ciſſers they cut away firſt the hair from that place
where they would have their artificial Star to
appear; then they take a piece of red Brick, and
rub it on the bare place, rubbing it till it come
to the roots of the hair; then wiping it clean
with a linnen rag, they make a Plaiſter of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy-pitch,
and ſpread it on a linnen cloth, ſo
long and ſo wide as they intend the Star, laying
on an hot Iron on the Pitch to ſoften it, ere they
lay the plaiſter to the place intended: having laid

letting them ſtick on till they fall off of their

take ſome Butter, but more Honey, and having
mingled them together, they anoint the Star
once in three days, and for that diſtance five

                  <p>Do not force your Horſe beyond his ability,

tie them to his Snuffle or Bit; then let it be

                  <p>Thus far I have treated of the internal diſeaſes
of Horſes, with their natures, ſigns, and cures,
in an Alphabetical manner; but I find no inward

therefore I could not finiſh the Alphabet; only
I find a diſeaſe called the <hi>Yellows,</hi> but becauſe it is

               <head type="sub">Of External Hurts and Sorrances in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
with Caveats to be obſerved in their
Cures, which are the beſt Rules or Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognita,
to be known by every one before
he enters on the practice of Horſe-Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery.</head>
               <p>YOu are to underſtand, that Sorrances are of
two ſorts; either an ill compoſition of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
diſcernible, either by number, ſhape, quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> or elſe the diviſion of an Unity, as when a
bone is broken, and then it is called a <hi>Fracture,</hi> in
the diſunion of the fleſh, it is called a wound, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Thus generally, now particularly.</p>
               <p>1. When ever you intend to burn, or caute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize,
or make inciſion, you muſt do it either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
or below, where there are joynts, Veins,
or Sinews.</p>
               <p>2. No violent corroſive, as Arſnick, Subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:44463:75"/>
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> muſt be applyed to any ſinewy part or
joynt.</p>
               <p>3. It is not ſo good to make an inciſion as it is
to cauterize.</p>
               <p>4. You muſt not take above the fourth part of
blood from a Colt which you do from an Horſe
grown to full maturity.</p>
               <p>5. In all Tumours or Impoſthumes, you muſt
obſerve their riſe, or beginning, increaſe, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
and concluſion.</p>
               <p>6. You muſt further obſerve as to thoſe ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
that if they be not near ſome principal
part, you may uſe any thing that is repercuſſive
in their beginnings; in their increaſe uſe medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
that may mollifie and ripen; when brought
to ſuppuration, launch them, and let out the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption;
in their declination uſe exſte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſive, clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
and healing Medicaments.</p>
               <p>7. If an Horſes legs be ſwelled, depreſs the
part with your finger, if a dent or hole remain,
you may conclude the hurt of long ſtanding, and
difficult to be cured; but, if removing your
finger thence, it fill, and riſe to its former
height, then is it a new hurt, and eaſily remedy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>8. Burn or Cauterize ſometimes under the
Sore, to divert humours, ſometimes above, to
defend and withhold humours. By the way, you
are to underſtand that Cauſticks and Corroſives
are called potential burnings, actually to burn is
with Inſtruments.</p>
               <p>9. It is better and ſafer cauterizing with Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
than Iron, but Steel is next; ſhun that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive
cuſtom of blowing powders into Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:44463:75"/>
Eyes, for it will ingender blindneſs; and
do not take up any Veins in the fore feet, for that
will cauſe ſtiffneſs and lameneſs.</p>
               <p>10. Breath a Vein twice a year, that is, in the
beginning of <hi>May</hi> and at the latter end of <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;</hi>
in <hi>May,</hi> becauſe then the blood beginneth to
encreaſe, and in <hi>December,</hi> to let out the groſs and
knotty blood occaſioned by labour or ill keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>11. Let not your Stallions blood, for they
expend enough in the covering of Mares; for
ſome are of opinion that one Ounce of ſeed coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervails
five ounces of Blood.</p>
               <p>12. Conſider the time of the day for your
blood-letting, and that muſt be in the morning
faſting, but not very early; next conſider his
age; for if young and immature, it will hinder
his growth; if old, his blood requireth rather to
be repaired than waſted; laſtly, look into his
ſtrength, for ſome can better ſpare three quarts
than another one.</p>
               <p>Now the ſigns to know when an Horſe ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in need to be let blood, are theſe.</p>
               <p>1. His Eyes will look very red, and his
Veins will ſtand ſwelling high more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary.</p>
               <p>2. He will be continually itching about his
Tail, and be frequently rubbing it, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
will ſhed ſome of his hair alſo.</p>
               <p>3. He will now and then pill about the roots
of his ears, or in that place where the Head-ſtall
of the bridle lieth.</p>
               <p>4. His Urine will be red and high-coloured,
and his Dung will be black and hard; or if he
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:44463:76"/>
have red inflammations on his back, or if there
be a yellowneſs in the whites of his eyes or inſide
of his Mouth; theſe are ſigns he would be let
blood.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, when you ſee there is a neceſſity of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
blood from your Horſe, for preventing fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ſickneſs, let him be ſparingly dieted a day or
two before, to the intent that his body may be
undiſturbed with digeſtion.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>The manner how to let an Horſe blood.</head>
                  <p>As near as you can let him ſtand on even
ground, and if it be the Neck-Vein you intend
to breath, then take a ſmall Cord, and throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it over his head bring it down as cloſe to
the ſetting on of his ſhoulder as you can, then
draw it very hard, and faſten it with a running
knot; this will make the Veins appear as big as a
mans little finger.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve that the place whereon you are to
ſtrike the Vein is within three or four fingers at
the moſt of the neather chap.</p>
                  <p>When you have thus raiſed the Vein up, then
with a wet Spunge or a little ſpittle wet that part
of the Vein you mean to ſtrike, and ſeparating
the hair, ſet your Fleime directly even upon the
Vein, and with a ſmart blow ſtrike it in, which
done, cauſe one to put his finger into the Horſes
mouth, and tickling him on the roof thereof,
make him chaw and move his chap, for that will
force the blood to ſpin forth; your Horſe having
bled ſufficiently, unlooſe the Cord and the Vein
will ſtop, then ſtroke down the Orifice and it
will divert the courſe of the blood into its proper
channel: after this turn him into the Stable, and
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:44463:76"/>
there let him faſt two hours, but after that feed
him according as you pleaſe, that is to ſay, a ſick
Horſe according to his diſtemper, and a ſound
Horſe with Hay, Oats or Graſs.</p>
                  <p>When you bleed his Temple-Veins or Eye-Veins,
you muſt then cord him about the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of the neck; but have a care you do not
throttle him: if in the Breaſt-Veins, then cord
him behind the ſhoulders over-thwart his Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                  <p>Now know, it is not botchingly, but dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to ſtrike any of theſe Veins in the head or
breaſt with a Fleim; and therefore, if you will
go to it like a Workman, breath thoſe Veins with
a ſharp Lancet. As for all other Veins in an
Horſes body (when to be let blood) they are not
to be corded but taken up: and the manner is
thus.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, caſt your Horſe upon ſome ſoft place, as
a Dunghil, not too ſoft, or on good ſtore of
ſtraw in ſome light place, then look for the Vein
which you intend to take up; but if by reaſon of
its ſmallneſs it is inviſible, then take warm wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and therewith chafe and rub the place, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
therein all that part wherein the Vein lieth;
then take a narrow ſilk ſtring, and an handful or
two above the Vein (if it be of any of the Horſes
legs) tye the member very ſtraight; but if it
be on the body or breaſt, then with a good Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingle
either cloſe behind the hinder point of the
ſhoulder, or within an handful of the place where
you intend to take up the Vein: gird him very
ſtraight, and preſently you ſhall ſee the Vein to
riſe, then mark that part of the skin which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:44463:77"/>
the Vein, and with your finger and your
thumb, pull it ſomewhat aſide from the Vein,
and then with a very fine Inciſion knife ſlit the
skin through without touching the Vein long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
and not above an inch in length, cutting
no deeper than the skin; that done, remove
your finger and thumb, and the skin will return
to its proper place, and through the ſlit you will
perceive the Vein look blew before your eyes;
then take a ſmooth Cronet made of the Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antler
of a Stag, or of an old Buck, and thruſt
it underneath the Vein, and lift it up a pretty
diſtance; that done, looſe either the ſtring or
Surſingle, for they were only helps to diſcover
the Vein.</p>
                  <p>The Vein being thus taken up on the Cronet,
take a ſmall piece of Shoomakers thred dipt in
Oyl or Butter, and put underneath the Vein alſo,
with which you ſhall knit the Vein when time
requireth: then the Cronet ſtanding as before,
with your knife ſlit the Vein long wiſe a quarter
of an inch, then with your thred ſtop the neather
part of the Vein, ſuffering it to bleed above; then
remove your thred above, knitting a knot above
the ſlit, and ſo let it bleed beneath; having bled
there ſufficiently, fill up the Orifice of the Vein
with Salt, and heal up the wound of the skin
with Turpentine and Hogs greaſe molten toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>The benefit that redounds by this taking up of
the Veins is manifold, for in general it eaſeth all
griefs, ſtrains and ſtiffneſs of the Limbs; but
particularly, the taking up of the Plat-Veins eaſeth
all pains in the breaſt, and griefs in the cheſt; the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:44463:77"/>
taking up of the Fore-thigh Veins helpeth Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
and ſwellings of the Legs: the taking up of
the Shackle-Veins before eaſeth Gourding, Quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-bones,
ſwelling of the joints, ſcabs, and
ſcratches: the taking up of the hinder hough
Veins helpeth Spavens of both kinds, eſpecially
any Farcy in thoſe parts, and generally all ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
and Impoſthumes: the taking up of the
Paſtern-Veins behind helpeth ſwellings about the
Cronet or neather joynts, pains, Mules, and all
manner of Kibed heels. Let thus much ſuffice
for a prefatatory diſcourſe or introduction; I

of blood, having a root like a Cocks ſtone; it
may grow upon any part of the Horſes body, but
principally it is diſcovered above the Eye-brows,
Noſtrils or Privy parts.</p>
                  <p>If it be high, take an Horſes hair and tye about
it very hard, making it faſt, and in eight or nine
days it will ſo eat through it, as that it will drop
off; but if it be flat you muſt burn it off with an
hot Iron, leaving none of the root behind, and
dry it up with the powder of Verdigreaſe; with
this proviſo, it lye not too near any ſinew; if ſo,
eat out the Core with Mercury; then ſtop the
hole with Flax dipt in the white of an Egge,
and dry it up with unſlaked Lime and Honey.</p>

                  <p>Accloying is no more than what we common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
call pricking with a Nail in the ſhooing, and
hereupon will halt; if you find the cauſe thereof
to be a prick, then take out the ſole, and cut the
hoof round about the place pricked; and having
removed the corruption, take Hurds ſteeped in
the whites of Egges, and fill up the hole; do
thus four days, and after that, heal up the ſore
with Salt made into fine powder, mingled with
Vinegar, and anoint the out-ſide of the hoof
with black Aegyptiacum: or this is as good a
remedy as the former, take Sallet-Oyl, Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine,

                  <p>
                     <hi>Avives</hi> is a Diſtemper otherwiſe called <hi>Vives</hi> or
<hi>Fives;</hi> they are certain flat Kernels, in likeneſs
to a bunch of Grapes growing in a cluſter; they
creep down from the Ears towards the Throat,
which when they are inflamed will ſwell, which
ſwelling as it is very painful, ſo it will prove
mortal, if not timely prevented; for by ſtopping
his wind it will ſoon ſuffocate him.</p>
                  <p>The common cauſes of this Diſtemper are
over-heatings, or extraordinary rankneſs of
blood.</p>
                  <p>In the Cure you muſt cautiouſly obſerve, not
to touch the Kernels with your fingers; but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
cut the skin long-ways ſo that the Kernels
lye open, take an inſtrument like a pair of Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and pinch forth the Kernels, and ſo apply
thereunto hurds ſteeped in the whites of Egges
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:44463:78"/>
well beaten and bound thereon; renew this day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſeven or eight times and it will cure it. This
is Mr. <hi>Greys</hi> way of curing the Avives. The
common way of curing it, is to draw down the
ſore with an hot Iron juſt in the midſt ſo far as
the ſwelling goeth, and then under the Ear draw
two other ſtroaks of the faſhion of an Arrows
head; then open the skin and with a ſmall pair
of Plyers pull out the Kernels and cut them off,
but have a care you injure not the Veins; that
done, fill the place with Bay-ſalt made into fine
powder, and after that heal up the ſore with a
green Ointment.</p>
                  <p>The cure of lateſt practice is to let him blood
on both ſides of the Neck; then clap a pair of
Barnacles on his noſe, and take a red hot Iron,
with the Edge as thick as the back of a Knife,
and with it make a ſtrike from the root of the
Ears upon the middle of the ſwelling downwards
to the loweſt part of the ſwelling, then burn it
till the skin be yellow; being thus ſeared, anoint
the ſwelling with a little butter or Hogs-greaſe;
according as the ſearing is leſs or more deep, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint
him ſeldomer or oftner, but four or five
times is ſufficient.</p>
                  <p>But the moſt approved Medicine for this Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady
which will cure it without burning, or any
ſuch violent means is: take a penny worth of
Pepper beaten to fine powder, Swines greaſe a
ſpoonful, the juice of an handful of Rue, and of
Vinegar two ſpoonfuls, mix theſe well together,
and convey it equally into both the Ears of the
Horſe, then ſhake the Ears that the Medicine may
ſink downwards, and after that tye them up;
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:44463:79"/>
when you have done this let him blood in the

                  <p>This Diſtemper proceedeth from too much
reſt, or from being not well rubbed about the
heels, for by this over much eaſe and pampering
the blood corrupting in his body falleth down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his hinder legs, and is much more venemous
and malignant than the Scratches.</p>
                  <p>The Cure muſt be wrought by taking half a

running Water with Allom, Muſtard, Sage and

                  <p>But the moſt approved remedy I can find for
this Malady is to let the Horſe be ridden till he
be warm, whereby the Veins will be more appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent:
then let him blood in the Fetlock-Veins on
both ſides, ſuffering him to bleed a good quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity;
then the next day waſh the ſores, with warm
Water, clipping away all the hair about the ſores,
and after this anoint them with an Oyntment
made after this manner: take green Coperas and
Verdigreaſe, of each two Ounces, and of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Honey four Ounces; beat the Coperas and
Verdigreaſe very ſmall, and work them up with
your Honey to a perfect Unguent, and herewith
dayly anoint the ſores till they be well.</p>

                  <p>The ſigns are apparent, and the cure not very

runneth along the inſide of the Thigh, and ſo

down the leg to the Paſtern, and from thence to the

                  <head>Canker in the Mouth.</head>
                  <p>The Ingredients which make up a Canker in
the Mouth, are a many ſore Bliſters, rawneſs of
Mouth and Tongue, with a ſharp hot humour
proceeding from thence, which frets and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodes,

                  <p>The Original of this diſeaſe is commonly ſome
unnatural heat ariſing from the ſtomach; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the Venom of filthy food is the cauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
                  <p>Some preſcribe this as an excellent Remedy:
Take of the juice of Daffadil-roots ſeven drachms,
of the juice of Hounds-tongue as much, of Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
the like quantity, of Alom one ounce; mingle
theſe well together, and waſh the Canker once a
day herewith till it be well.</p>
                  <p>Others uſe this remedy: Take half a pint of
the beſt white Wine-vinegar, and half a pound of
the beſt Roch Alom, and an handful of red
Sage, and boil them all together, and therewith
waſh the Horſes mouth and tongue.</p>
                  <p>If the Canker be in the Tongue only, then
take of Roch-Alom the quantity of an Egg;
boil it in four or five ſpoonfuls of white Wine-vinegar,
with a ſpoonful of Engliſh Honey, and
an handful of Columbine-leaves cut ſmall, and
therewith waſh his Tongue once a day, and it
will be quickly whole.</p>
                  <p>But the beſt of all remedies comes at laſt: Take
of Ginger and Alom of each a like quantity, finely
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:44463:85" rendition="simple:additions"/>
pulverized; then with ſtrong Vinegar ſo mingle
them that they be as thick as a Salve; then with
Alom-water or Vinegar waſh the Canker clean,
and then anoint it with this Salve, which in twice

heal of it ſelf.</p>

                  <p>There are two ſtrings like threads, which are
therefore called Cords, becauſe, lying betwixt
the knee and the body, it goeth like a ſmall cord
through the body to the Noſtrils; making an
Horſe to ſtumble much, and ſometimes to fall.</p>
                  <p>It proceeds commonly from an extream cold
which lodgeth in the ſtomach, which cauſeth the
Cords to ſhrink up in ſo great a meaſure, that
ſometimes he can neither lift his head to the rack
nor put his head to the ground, nay, not ſo much
as to his knees.</p>
                  <p>The only ſigns of this Malady are his often

                  <p>To cure him you muſt take the end of a crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Harts horn that is ſharp, put it under the
Cords, and twine it a dozen times about, till
the Horſe be conſtrained to lift up his foot, then
cut the cord aſunder, and put a little Salt into
the iſſue; or cut it firſt at the Knee, then at the
end of his Noſe, and ſo draw it upwards a ſpan
length, and cut that off. Others only open that
Vein that deſcendeth on the inſide of the leg

blood; and after ſeven days waſh him with
Beef broth; and they ſay it is a ſpeedy cure.</p>
                  <p>But the neweſt way of curing this Diſtemper,
is firſt to make him this comfortable Drink:
take half an Ounce of Diapente, one Ounce of

Engliſh Saffron, dry it by the fire, and crumble

then ſet him up; five hours after give him a little

the Horſe to halt after any exerciſe: labour puts

                  <head>Dangerous Sickneſs, and how it cometh.</head>
                  <p>This dangerous ſickneſs in general proceedeth
from many and particular cauſes, having each of
them peculiar ſigns, and therefore muſt have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
remedies.</p>
                  <p>The cauſes may be ranked under theſe four
heads: firſt, dangerous Maladies may proceed
from heats occaſioned by over much labour or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe;
hence comes molten Greaſe, the heart
over-charged, and its pores ſo obſtructed, that it
cannot perform his function; by which means
the ſpirits are detrimented, and the whole body
put out of order; and the ſigns hereof will be
dulneſs of countenance, ſwelling in his limbs,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:44463:90"/>
ſcouring, and loathing of his meat. The ſecond
original cauſe of dangerous ſickneſs, are Colds
from indiſcreet keeping after violent exerciſe, or
otherwiſe, and the ſymptoms of this are heavy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of countenance, with ſleepineſs, Puſtuls, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed
Kernels and ſwellings, a rotten inward
Cough, after which he cheweth ſome filthy phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick
matter between his teeth.</p>
                  <p>The third cauſe of dangerous ſickneſs is ſurfeit
by food, either by over eating or under eating of
that which is good, or eating of what is unwhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome:
by the firſt all ill humours aſcend into the
head, from which are bred the Stavers, Phren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zies,
with other deadly diſeaſes. From the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
proceeds the putrefaction of the blood, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
all the nutriment into corruption; hence
come the Yellows, Farcy, Feavers, Mange, with
other ſuch like peſtilential and loathſome Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers.
The ſigns hereof are a dulneſs of the face
and eyes, in ſuch ſort as the Horſe will be unable
to lift up his head as high as the Manger, his
upper lip and ſheath cold, his pace ſtaggering,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>

three or four mornings together give him ſome
Diapente to drink, keeping him warm, and well

                  <head>Eating away of Knobs, or any ſuperfluous dead fleſh.</head>
                  <p>Sometimes it ſo happens that an Horſe may
have a bone growing on ſome part of his body,
more than what is natural; ſometimes Lumps
and Bunches of ſuperfluous fleſh, and this is
called an Excretion, which doth proceed from
rough and phlegmatick ſubſtances, ſtirred up
either by moſt ſore bruiſes or wounds imperfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
healed; that is, when Cauſticks or burning
Corroſives are applied to wounds that are near
the bone; as when the wound is either in the
Leg, or about the Paſterns; for that the fleſh
being extremely burned and mortified by ſuch
Cauſticks and Corroſives, it doth cauſe an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
to grow upon the bone; now oftentimes
the Wound is healed up, but the Excretion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
ſtill upon the Bone, which occaſioneth a
new Cure, which muſt be in this manner. With
an Inciſion-knife firſt ſcarifie the Excretion,
then apply Sulphur and Bitumen, or Coloquin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tida
burnt and ſifted; and having quite eaten a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the Excretion, then heal it up with dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Salves, as the powder of Honey, Lime, or
Bole-armoniack. Others are of opinion that
this way is beſt: firſt make the Excretion to
bleed well; then take 2 ounces of Vine-aſhes and as
much unſlak'd lime mixt with 6 ounces of ſtrong
Lye, firſt ſtrained, then ſod till half be conſumed,
and ſo conſolidated; apply this to the Excretion
and it will ſoon eat it away, then heal it up as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid.</p>
                  <p>Others approve of this laſt way as the beſt:
Take Elecampane-root, newly gathered, and
having cleanſed it from its Earth, wrap it up
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:44463:93"/>
in a brown paper, and cover it up in the hot
Embers till it be fully roaſted, like pap; then
take it, and as hot as your Horſe can endure it
(for you muſt not ſcald him) lay it to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
(after you have rubbed, knocked and
chafed the Excretion, binding this roaſted root
cloſe thereunto, letting it remain compleatly a
day and a night before you remove it) the third
dreſſing, after this manner, will rot and conſume
the Excretion to nothing.</p>
                  <p>Now for the eating away of any proud fleſh,
which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you ſhall perceive to grow in any Wound,
Ulcer or Sore, which dead fleſh you ſhall know
by the inſenſibility thereof, being of a ſpongy
hollow ſubſtance; you ſhall take freſh greaſe and
Verdegrieſe, and boil them together, of each a
like quantity, and being well boiled tent or
plaiſter the Sore therewith, which will quickly
bring the dead fleſh to a conſumption.</p>
                  <p>There are great variety of medicaments that
are good for the eating away any dead fleſh, as
Precipitate Simple is alone ſufficient, <hi>Spongia
Marina</hi> and powder of Riſagallo are of like

                  <p>But by reaſon there is ſuch choice of medicines

way will better preſerve the ſight of the Eye, as
alſo the Waſh which is the ornament thereof;
for if that be taken away, the Horſe will appear
blear-eyed; ſo ſoon as you have cut away the
Haw, waſh the Eye with white Wine and the

ſet him up.</p>
                  <p>This Foot-foundring in an Horſe is a certain
numbneſs, pricking or tingling within his hoofs,
and I can compare it to no more proper thing,
than when any of us by croſs ſitting do cauſe our
feet to be aſleep as we ſay vulgarly, during which

ſtopped, thoſe obſtructions cauſe that tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>Several are the cauſes of this Malady; briefly,
it comes ſometimes by taking off his Saddle too
ſuddainly after a great heat, or by ſtanding ſtill
in the cold unwalked, or by ſtanding in ſome
ſhallow Water after he hath been ridden no high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

paſs, which for its excellency can hardly be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued,
and is good for all ſorts of Foundrings new
or old.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place, you muſt with a very ſharp
drawing knife draw every part of the ſoles of the
Horſes feet as thin as poſſibly you may, even till
you draw water and blood from him, and part
every part alike: then at the very ſharp end of
the fruſh of the Horſes foot you ſhall ſee the Vein
lye, then with your knifes end lift up the hoof,
and bleed the Vein; which it will do indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:44463:98"/>
plentiful as long as you hold up the hoof, when
it hath bled ſomewhat more than a pint, cloſe
up the hoof, and ſo ſtop the Vein: then faſten on
his hoof an hollow ſhooe made for that purpoſe;
having ſo done, clap a little Tow dipt in Hogs
Greaſe, and Turpentine very hard: then take
two or three Egges roaſted very hard, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
burning hot from the fire, break them on
the ſole of the Horſes foot; then pour upon them
Hogs greaſe, Turpentine, and Tar boiling hot,
and as much flax dipt therein as will fill up the
hollow ſhooe; then lay on a piece of Leather to
keep all in; in this manner dreſs as many of his
feet as are foundred: dreſs him thus thrice in a

                  <p>A falſe quarter takes its denomination from
the ſcituation of the Sorrance on the hoof, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
that part of the hoof look as if it did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
belong to the whole, but was artificially
ſet on; it moſt commonly afflicts the inſide of
the hoof, becauſe it is the weakeſt part, and theſe
inſides are called quarters, thence a <hi>falſe quarter,</hi>
which is no more than to ſay a ſick and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound
quarter.</p>
                  <p>The falſe quarter happens frequently from evil
ſhooing, ill paring, and ſometimes by pricking
with a Nail.</p>
                  <p>The common Symptoms are, the Horſe will
halt much, the riſt will bleed, and when the
ſhooe is off there is nothing will interpoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Sorrance and your ſight, but that it
will be palpably apparent.</p>
                  <p>The cure whereof is to cut away the old cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
hoof, and then take the whites of nine Eggs,
the powder of Incenſe, of unſlackt Lime, of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick,
of Verdigreaſe, and of Salt, of each three
Ounces, mingle theſe well together, then dip in
as much hurds as will cover the fore hoof, lay it
on, and all about it lay Swines greaſe an Inch
thick, or more; do this alſo below it; bind this
on in ſuch wiſe that it may not be ſtirred for a

Now if any corruption be gathered together
within the falſe quarter in ſuch manner that
the Horſe will go halting with much pain and
difficulty, which matter you ſhall know if there
be any there, by laying your finger on the falſe
quarter, at which the Horſe will ſtart or ſhrink if
it be ripe; if ſo, open it with a drawing knife,
and let out the corruption, then lay thereon
Horſe dung, Oyl, Salt and Vinegar, mixt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the manner of a Plaiſter, this will not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
heal the Sorrance, but conſolidate the hoof,
and make it firm: at firſt after the cure is wrought
be careful in ſhooing him till his hoof be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hardned.</p>
                  <p>There is yet another way to cure this Sorrance
which by Mr. <hi>Grey</hi> is accounted the beſt he ever
met with, and was taught him by a very skilful
French Farrier, which is this.</p>
                  <p>Take a piece of wood that is flat, and form it
an inch broad at leaſt, making it ſo thin and ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that it will bend like an hoop, which muſt
be long enough to come twice about the Cronet
of the hoof; get alſo an indifferent long piece of
Filletting in readineſs, and cut it in two pieces;
then having brought the hoop about the Cronet
with one piece of the filletting bind faſt the top
of the hoop, making it faſt behind againſt the
heel: then take the other piece of filletting, and
faſten it to the top of the firſt filletting, ſowing it
as well on the one ſide of the hoof as on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>But I ſhould have told you that before you fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten

and near that you come to the very quick, which
you know by the flowing of a certain kind of
dewy moiſture, let that be your ſign for binding
on your hoop, having before prepared this Salve
in a readineſs to fill up the chinks of the ſaid
quarter.</p>

become ſoft, then pound them very well, and
ſtrain them through a fine Searſer, reſerving a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

Wax, Burgundy Pitch, of each half a pound, of
black Pitch four Ounces, of the oldeſt Oyl Olive
one quart, put theſe together with the former

them off the fire, and put in your Turpentine;
then let it have one walm or two over the fire;
then take it off, continually ſtirring it till it be

                  <p>With this Salve anoint and rub well the place

either in the ſole, or any other part of the foot.</p>
                  <p>The old experienced Farriers were wont to cut

                  <p>The running Fruſh is a Sorrance called by ſome
Country Smiths the Frog; becauſe it breedeth
in that ſpongy part of the Heel, which they call
the Frog. I know not for what reaſon they ſhould
give it that appellation, ſince it is formed and
faſhioned like a forked Arrow-head, and is the
tendereſt part of the Hoof towards the Heel;
this is that part which when Farriers cut, they
ſay they cut forth the ſole of the Horſes foot.</p>
                  <p>The cauſes of this Sorrance are ſeveral; as
firſt, when the Smith inconſiderately pareth that
part to the quick, which afterwards becomes ſore
and often turns to the Running Fruſh; which will
ſo ſtink as not to be endured, by reaſon of the
Gravel getting into it through travel, cauſing a
rankling and impoſtumation; ſometimes it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
by an evil humour, falling down into the
legs, and making its way out through the Fruſh,
being the ſofteſt and tendereſt part of the foot:
now though hereby the legs are kept clean from
Wind-galls, and all other tumours and ſwellings,
by reaſon that the humours have paſſage that
way, yet by reaſon of the corruption gathering
into that part, I look upon the miſchief of this
Sorrance much greater than the advantage it
brings with it, making the Horſes foot ſo weak
and tender, that he is not able to tread on any
hard ground.</p>
                  <p>The ſigns are; he will ever go beſt on green
ſwarth; but when he comes into hard and dry
dirty ways he will halt, by reaſon of the Gravel
getting in, fretting and paining him to the quick;
and you ſhall obſerve that when he reſteth, the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:44463:101"/>
Fruſh will weep, ſending forth a watry ſtuff,
which will ſo ſtink the ſcent will be inſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
                  <p>The Cure: Take ſtale Chamber-lye, and boil
it with a quantity of Alom, and keep it cloſe
ſtopped in a Glaſs; then take of red Nettles two
handfuls, the ſtrongeſt and moſt angry; dry them
well, and reduce them to powder; and what
quantity of this powder you have, join to it as
much beaten Pepper, and mix them well toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and keep it in a dry Bladder for your uſe;
when you have occaſion to make uſe thereof,
take off the ſhooe, and open the Fruſh; then waſh
the ſorrance to the very bottom, with this wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and powder mixed together and warmed;
then hollow the ſhooe that it hurt not the Fruſh,
and ſo put it on; but before you do it, the foot
being well waſhed and cleanſed from all putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
and gravel, fill the hole with the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
powder, and ſtop it with Hurds, and
ſplent it, that the Hurds may keep in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and that nothing may come to prejudice
the Sorrance; and thus renew the waſhing with
filling up the hole with the powder every day
once, and in ſeven or eight days it will be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
cured, provided you ſuffer no dung to
come to the place afflicted, and that he tread
not on any wet during the time of the

                  <p>Take of Turpentine, Swines-greaſe, Sheeps-ſuet
of each a like quantity; and being molten
together make a Salve thereof, and dreſs him
therewith ſix days together, obſerving to make
your tent of very fine ſoft linnen cloth and fine
flax, not making your tent too big after the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
dreſſing; then lay upon and about the ſore
this Pulteſs: Firſt, take two gallons of fair wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and having boiled it, ſcum it well; then take
three handfuls of Mallows, and the like of the
leaves of Violets, with two of Oat-meal or more;
put theſe into the former water with Hogs-mort
and freſh Butter of each a pound, and let it boil
till it become thick, like paſte, and ſo apply it hot
to the ſore.</p>
                  <p>Now ſome, on the other ſide, will make uſe of
no other thing for the cure of a Fiſtula than this:
Take the outermoſt green ſhells of Walnuts, and
put them in a Tub, ſtrowing three or four hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls
of Bay-ſalt upon them on the top, midſt and
bottom, and ſo keep them all the year; and when
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:44463:103"/>
they have occaſion to uſe them, they take a pint
thereof with a little Bay-ſalt, two ounces of black
Soap, half a ſpoonful of May-butter, or inſtead
thereof freſh Butter, and incorporate them well
together, and with this they tent or plaiſter the
Fiſtula, anointing the Sorrance with Turpentine
two hours before they lay on the Plaiſter; obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus to do till the Fiſtula be perfectly
healed.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, let me preſcribe you two Remedies more,
not inferiour to any afore-recited, and I have
done.</p>
                  <p>Take Verdigrieſe, Butter and Salt; mingle
and melt theſe together; having ſo done pour it,
ſcalding hot into the ſore; and thus uſe it till all
the fleſh be red; after this, tent it with Verde-grieſe,
burnt Allom, Wheat-flower and the
Yolks of Eggs, well beaten and mingled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and laſtly, skin it with Barm and Soot mixt
together.</p>
                  <p>Take a pint of the ſtrongeſt Vinegar you can
get, and having made it hot on the fire, add there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
of the Lome of a Clay-wall, which hath no
lime in it, but pick not out the ſtraws therein, and
ſo boil them together till they become a Salve;
being indifferently hot ſpread it over the Sorance,
eſpecially ſuch places as feel hard; do thus twice
a day, and it will not only ripen but heal the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtula:
this is alſo a ſovereign Cure for any gall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or bruiſed back, how grievouſly ſore ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>

                  <p>The beſt and moſt approved Cure is, to make
a ſtrong Lye with old Urine, Aſh-aſhes and green

will not only kill but heal them. Others take a
Snake, and throwing away the head and tail,
roaſt the reſt of the body cut into pieces, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving

                  <p>Now if your Horſe be fretted or galled under
the belly, as it frequently happens, when the
Girths are crumpled or knotty, and there withal
drawn too ſtrait; then take of Oyl de Bay and
Oyl of Balm two ounces, of Pitch two ounces, of
Tar two ounces, and one ounce of Rozin; mingle

                  <p>An Horſe comes to be gravelled by ſand
getting in between the ſole and the hoof, or the

on the outſide; and ſometimes on both ſides
of the heel, ſettling at the quick, and there
fretteth and feſtereth. Sometimes it happeneth
by the calking or ſpong of the ſhooe, which by
much labour and travel doth eat through the
hoof into the quick of the foot, and ſo much
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:44463:104"/>
the ſooner, by how much the Horſes heels are
ſoft and weak; or that the ſhooe, lying too flat
to his foot, the gravel getting in can in no wiſe
get out again.</p>
                  <p>His grief will be ſoon diſcovered by his halting
and complaining on the ſame foot; which as
ſoon as you ſhall diſcover, take up that foot he
endeavoureth to favour, and you ſhall find it
more hot than uſual, and warmer than the reſt
of his feet.</p>
                  <p>Then take off his ſhooe, and with your Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
iron draw the place till you come to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
quick, and having pickt forth all the Gravel,
and cruſht forth the blood and corruption,
then waſh your ſore clean with this Copperas-water:</p>
                  <p>Take two quarts of fair water, and put it into
a clean Skillet or Poſnet; then put thereto
half a pound of green Copperas, and of Salt one
handful, of ordinary Honey one ſpoonful, and
two or three bunches of Roſemary, boil theſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
till one half of the liquor be conſumed; a
little before you take it from the fire, add there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
of Alom the quantity of a Wallnut; taking
it from the fire let it ſtand till it is cold, and then
put it in ſome Veſſel for your uſe. After this,
pour on your ſore Sheeps-tallow and Bay-ſalt
molten together, ſcalding hot; then ſtop up the
hole with Hurds, and ſo ſet on the ſhooe again.</p>
                  <p>Dreſs it thus twice or thrice and it will be
whole; but let his foot be throughly well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

water.</p>
                  <p>Now you are to underſtand, that if a Gravel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

will riſe higher than the hoof, it will coſt you
much more labour in bolſtring and abating that
ill-grown carnoſity.</p>
                  <p>Some of our late Farriers are of opinion, that
this following receipt is an excellent remedy for
any Gravelling, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, you muſt ſo pare the
hoof that the ſore may be viſible; then take an

                  <p>Now to the intent that your own experience

of Houſleek one head; incorporate all theſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether

                  <p>There are three things to be obſerved in the

of the year, and ſtate of the Moon.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, as to the Age; all Colts you may geld
at twelve days old, or a little ſooner, which I
rather approve of than of fifteen or twenty days
old; for the ſooner a Colt is gelded, if his ſtones
are come down, the more it will improve his
growth, ſhape and courage; and though many
have obſtinately affirmed, that a year and a half
or two years old, is the beſt time for gelding, yet
ſuch have been at laſt forced to confeſs the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
by woful experience.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="195" facs="tcp:44463:105"/>
An Horſe you may geld at any age whatſoever
with this Proviſo, that great care be taken in the
Cure.</p>
                  <p>The Time or Seaſon of the year for Gelding,
the beſt I hold to be at Spring and Fall, that is
to ſay, from the latter end of March till the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of October.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, as to the ſtate of the Moon, then is
the beſt time when ſhe is in the decreaſe; and
this is not only the opinion of all ancient Farri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
but is confirmed by the experience of thoſe
of later practice.</p>
                  <p>Now as to the general manner of Gelding,
whether of Foal, Colt or Horſe, it is thus: Let
the place you chuſe to caſt him on be Straw or a
ſoft Dunghil, not too moiſt; then taking the
ſtone between your foremoſt finger and your great
finger, with a fine Inciſion-knife ſlit the Cod,
ſo that you may only preſs the ſtone forth; then
with a pair of ſmall Nippers, very ſmoth, clap
the ſtrings of the ſtone between them, very near
to the ſetting on of the ſtone, and preſs them ſo
hard that there may be no flux of blood; then
with a thin Cauterizing-iron red hot, ſear away
the ſtone; then take a hard Plaiſter of Rozin,
Wax, and waſht Turpentine, well molten toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and with your hot Iron melt it on the head
of the ſtrings, and having ſear'd the ſtrings, lay
a good quantity of this Salve thereon; then looſe
the Nippers, and as you did with one ſtone ſo do
with the other.</p>
                  <p>Having thus done, fill the two ſlits of the Cod
with white Salt; then take Hogs-greaſe clean
rendred, and anoint the outſide of the Cod, as alſo
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:44463:106"/>
his Thighs and Belly over, and ſo let him
riſe.</p>
                  <p>If after his gelding, you perceive any extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
ſwelling either in his Sheath or Cod;
then chaſe him up and down, making him once

                  <p>I conceive that there is little difference between
the Garget and Plague, Peſtilence or Murrain,
being all malignant and Peſtilential diſtempers,
the Infected being infectious to thoſe Horſes
which ſtand by them; it is preſent death to open
a Vein in this diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>You may know this diſeaſe by theſe ſigns or
ſymptoms: He will hang down his head very
much, gumming thick atter at the eyes, as
big as the top of a mans finger, his pace will
be weak and ſtaggering, with ſwelling oftentimes
in his head, but his body will very much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay
on a ſudden, and yet have a good ſtomach
to his meat.</p>
                  <p>For the Cure take this Preſcription: Take of
Diapente, Dialphora, <hi>London</hi>-Treacle, Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
and Saffron of each the quantity of an Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel-nut,
an handful of Wormwood, as much of

two Cloves of Garlick; boil all theſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

one half, then give it him to drink luke-warm
faſting, and keep him very warm: the

Maſh made of ground malt, and let him drink
warm water for a week, giving him ſometimes
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:44463:106"/>
ſome burſten Oats, and clean ſweet Hay; it is
ſweating that muſt effect the Cure. Now foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much

                  <p>For the Cure, you muſt caſt the beaſt; then
cut the skin through on the midſt of the ſwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
fleaing the skin on each ſide, as far as the
ſwelling extendeth; then take fine white Wood-Aſhes
ſifted, and mix them with mould ſtale old
Piſs; ſtir them well together, and waſh the ſore
therewith, and it will diſſipate the ſwelling.</p>
                  <p>If the Garget be under the root of a Cows or
Bullocks tongue, there ſwelling, cauſing his
head and face to ſwell alſo, frothy at mouth,
and forſaking his meat; then muſt you cure him
by firſt caſting him ſo, that by the fall he bruiſe
not his body; then with your hand pull out his
tongue as far as you can, and with the point of
a Lancet or ſharp Pen-knife, ſlit down the middle
Vein under his tongue about an Inch, and from
thence will iſſue black blood and water, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from the gall; then with Salt and Vinegar
mingled together, waſh or rub the place there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with

take an Egg-ſhell filled full with Tar, and put it
down the Cows or Bullocks throat, then take two

                  <head>Galled Back that cometh by the Saddle, or Shackle.</head>
                  <p>For an Horſe to have a Galled back is very
common, and hapneth ſo many ſeveral ways,
that it would not only be tedious but endleſs to
deſcribe them. I ſhall therefore only inſiſt upon
the moſt material, and that is either by the Sadle,
Pannel, Pack ſaddle, or Male-pillion, which fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
injure the back of an Horſe, either by
evil ſtuffing or want of ſtuff, or the Tree may
be ſo faulty, that all the art of an ingenious
Saddler ſhall not be able to correct the errour;
and that is, when at firſt it is not rightly ſhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or afterwards by accident either crack'd or
broken.</p>
                  <p>You need not enquire after the ſigns, for they
are commonly viſible; as great ſwelling, hair
fretted off, skin broken, and the back raw with
inflammation; but if none of theſe ſymptoms
appear, and yet the Horſes back is certainly
wrung by the Saddle; you may find it out by
ſtroking your hand all along his back when the
Saddle is off; if hurt, he will ſhake his head,
winch with his tail, ſhake, he will offer to ſtrike
or bite, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If you find that his back is ſwelled without
impoſtumation, clap on the ſwelling ſome of
his wet Litter, and ſetting on his Saddle again,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:44463:107"/>
ſo let him remain with his Saddle on all night,
and by the next morning his ſwelling will be ſo
abated as not to be diſcerned.</p>
                  <p>If the hair be only galled off, and the place be
not impoſtumated, then only anoint the part
with a little Butter and Salt melted together,
and you need dreſs him but twice to make it
perfectly whole.</p>
                  <p>But if the Back be ſo galled, that not only the
hair is fretted off, but the skin too, and the place
appears palpably raw, then take three parts of
new Sheeps-dung, and one part of Wheat-flower,
and mingle them well together, kneading into
paſte and flatting it, bake it a little; then take
ſome of the powder hereof warm, and lay it to
the place; this is a ſpeedy Cure.</p>
                  <p>Now if your Horſe be galled by Lock, Cord
or Shackle, then, believe me, this is a ſovereign
remedy: Take of live Honey ſeven ſpoonfuls,
of Verdegrieſe half an ounce, and boil them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
till the Honey be half conſumed, and that
it become red; then put it into ſome clean pot,
and anoint the Sorrance therewith, made warm
twice every day; and when you have anointed
the place, caſt thereon hurds cut very ſhort, to
keep on the Ointment, and this will heal it
ſpeedily.</p>
                  <p>Next to this we muſt conſider an Horſes back
that is ſo galled, that it is withal ſo inflamed,
that there is no expectation but that much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtumation
will follow, before it be cured; then
you may do well to take Barm, and ſo much Soot
as will thicken it; not ſo thick as Paſte, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
fluid like Tar, and therewith make a Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:44463:108"/>
and lay it to the Sorrance:</p>
                  <p>Now, beſides what is already ſpoken of, there
are many more things which will cure a Galled
back; as the powder of Briar leaves well dryed;
the Powder of Honey and unſlak'd Lime; the
powder of wild Cowcumbers, dried in an oven,
will effect this cure, ſo that the Sorrance be firſt
waſhed in Vinegar; the bone of a Crab-fiſh pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verized,
or the powder of Oiſter-ſhells will do the
like; but that which may ſerve inſtead of all the
reſt is; Take Hay and boil it in ſtrong Urine, and
lay it to the ſwelled place, and it will aſſwage
the pain and bring it to ſuppuration; then lance
it, and let out the corruption; then ſtop the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
with Rozin, Wax and freſh Greaſe all molten
together; but if you perceive that dead fleſh
grow within the ſore, then eat it out with Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digreaſe
pulverized or Precipitate, ſtrowing
thereof on the proud fleſh; when that is ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
the powder of Rozin is ſufficient to dry
it up perfectly.</p>

Wine to it, then mix it well, and put it into a
Kettle, then adde thereunto half a pound of the
powder of Bole Armoniack, of common Engliſh
Honey one pound, it being on the fire, keep it
continually ſtirring, till it be throughly boiled;
in the boiling put in half a pound of black Pitch,

hot as much as ever the Horſe can indure, and
anoint twice or thrice a day the place grieved,

                  <p>Now if the ſhoulder of the Horſe be pinched,
as it often hapneth by ſtraining the Horſe too
young, or by carrying too great a weight; then
you muſt firſt rowel him, then lay this Plaiſter
over his Breaſt, Shoulders and Withers.</p>
                  <p>Take of Pitch and Rozen, of each a pound,
of Tar half a pint, boil theſe together, and when
it is indifferent cold, take a woollen Cloth bound
to the end of a ſtick, and dip it into the charge,
and daub therewith all the ſhoulder over, then
take Flocks as near as you can of the colour of
the Horſe, and lay thereon, and once in two
days make your Rowels clean, and put them in
again; continue thus doing twelve or fourteen
days; after this, take out the Rowels, and heal
up the wounds with tents of Flax dipt in Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine
and Hogs greaſe molten together, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
this once a day till it be whole; you may
let him run to graſs till he be twice or thrice

                  <p>The wrench in the ſhoulder cometh from a ſlip

turning, and ſometimes by the ſtroke of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Horſe.</p>
                  <p>The only ſign that I know of is his trailing of
his leg upon the ground cloſe after him.</p>
                  <p>The remedy is this; firſt, take away three
pints of blood at leaſt from his Plat Vein; having
ſaved the blood in a clean veſſel, then put there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
a quart of ſtrong Vinegar, with half a dozen
Egges broken, and their ſhells, and ſo much
Wheat flower as will thicken all the liquor; that
done, put thereunto a pound of the powder of
Bole-Armoniack, Sanguis-Draconis two Ounces,
and mingle them ſo that the flower may be invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible;
take this, and with your hand daub all the
ſhoulder from the Main downward, and betwixt
the fore bowels, all againſt the hair; this done;
tye him up to the rack, and let him not lye down
all that day, then diet him but ſparingly for thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
days, and refreſh the ſhoulder point with
this charge once a day, and after this let him
have a months reſt at leaſt, and his ſhoulder will
be reduced to the former ſound condition.</p>
                  <p>Such as are of late experience preſcribe this
method for the cure:</p>
                  <p>They firſt let the Horſe blood in the Breaſt-Vein,
and then Rowel him from the neather part
of the Spade-bone down to the point of the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
having ſo done, they take a Patten ſhooe,
and ſet it on the ſound foot, and ſo turn him to
graſs for a month, not forgetting once in two
days to remove the Rowels, and ſo thruſt out the
corruption: As ſoon as they perceive that he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:44463:113"/>
ſound, they take off the Patten ſhooe, and
pull out the Rowels and let him ſtill run at graſs,
till he have taken a froſt or two.</p>
                  <p>I cannot diſcommend this method, for I have
made trial thereof with very good ſucceſs: I ſhall

                  <p>Old Sores or Ulcers have a threefold diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
the firſt are Fiſtula's, being Sores which are
deep, hollow and crooked: the ſecond are Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers;
this Sorrance is known by its ſhape, which
is broad and ſhallow, and by its nature ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and increaſing: the laſt are old Sores or Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
which are differenced from the two former,
by being deep, black about the ſides and bottom,
neither increaſing nor healing.</p>
                  <p>The cauſes are either bruiſe, wound or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtume
abuſed in the cure; or elſe the cauſe
may ariſe from the negligence or unskilfulneſs of
the Farrier, ſuffering ill humours to ſlow down
into thoſe parts.</p>
                  <p>The ſigns are (according to Mr. <hi>Markham</hi>'s
judgment) the long continuance of the Sore,
the blackneſs thereof with inflammation, and
the thinneſs of the matter flowing from it.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve this in the Cure; firſt mundifie or
cleanſe the ſore well with white Wine; then take
Lilly-leaves and Copperas, and beat them well
in a Mortar with Swines-greaſe till they turn to
a Salve; then with flax lay it on the Sorrance, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
it alſo with a Plaiſter, as in the cure of
wounds, and it will ſpeedily be a Cure; this muſt
be renewed once a day.</p>
                  <p>But as for an old Ulcer in particular, I never
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:44463:116"/>
found any thing by experience better than this:
Take Frankincenſe, Maſtick, Cloves, green Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peras
and Brimſtone of each a like quantity, twice
as much Myrrh as any of the former; beat it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
powder, and burn it on a Chafing diſh and
coals, but let it not flame; as the ſmoak ariſeth,
take an handful of Lint, and hold it over the
ſmoak, ſo that it may receive the fume there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
into it; then cloſe this Lint in a Box, and
keep it.</p>
                  <p>It is to be ſuppoſed that this Lint (or you may
uſe fine Hurds inſtead thereof) is throughly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed;
and obſerve before you uſe it, purifie
and waſh well with Urine, or Vinegar either,
made warm, the ſore, and then having dried it,

                  <p>If any ſwelling doth impoſtumate you ſhall
diſcern it by the heat, for if you lay your hand
thereon, you will feel it burn exceedingly; when
you have diſcovered the nature of the malady,
your next care muſt be to ripen it, ſo that it may
be fit to be opened; for that purpoſe take Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-roots,
and white Lilly-root of each a like
quantity; bruiſe them and put unto them Hogs-greaſe
and Linſeed-meal; boil theſe till they are
ſoft, and then lay them in manner of a Plaiſter to
the Swelling.</p>
                  <p>Before I give you any more receipts for the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening
or ſoftning an Impoſtume, give me lieve
to tell you firſt what an Impoſtume is; which may
be thus defined.</p>
                  <p>It is a gathering or knitting together of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
and moſt corrupt humours in any part or
member of the body, making that part to ſwell
extremely, and growing into ſuch violent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation,
that in the end, they rot and break
out into foul, mattery and running ſores, having
their original, either from corruption of food or
corruption of blood.</p>
                  <p>Now let me proceed to give you a farther ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of what will ripen them.</p>
                  <p>Some take Swines-greaſe, red Wax and the
flower of Euphorbium, and mixing them well
on the fire lay it to the Impoſtume.</p>
                  <p>Others ſay this is better, to take two handfuls of
Sorrel, and lapping it in a Dock-leaf, roaſt it in
the hot embers, and ſo lay it very hot to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtume,
renewing it once a day.</p>
                  <p>But in my opinion this is beſt: Take of <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:44463:117"/>
Draconis,</hi> of Gum Arabick, of new Wax, of
Maſtick, of Pitch of Greece, of Incenſe and of
Turpentine, of each a like quantity; melt theſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and having ſtrained them, make a Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
thereof, and lay it to the Impoſtume, and this
will both ripen, break and heal it; ſo much in
general.</p>
                  <p>Now you are to underſtand there are two
ſorts of Impoſtumes, the one hot, and the other
cold.</p>
                  <p>If the Impoſtume hath its original from any
hot cauſe, as extraordinary travel, or inflamed
blood; then, according to the judgment of the
moſt knowing, take Liverwort and ſtamp it, and
mingle it with the grounds of Ale, Hogs-greaſe
and Mallows bruiſed. Or you may take Lettice-ſeed
or Poppy-ſeed, and mix it with the Oyl of
red Roſes, and lay it on the Sore plaiſter-wiſe, if
it be done at the beginning of the ſwelling, it will
take it clean away.</p>
                  <p>But if the Impoſtume be engendered by any
cold cauſe, then take Balm and Hogs-greaſe, and
ſtamp them well together, and apply it as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.</p>
                  <p>Or open the Impoſtume in the loweſt part,
with a hot Iron; then waſh it with warm Urine,
after that anoint it with Tar and Oil well mixt
together: Note by the way; if you make your
Inciſion in the form or manner of an half-Moon,
it will be more advantagious for your
purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Or Laſtly, take an handful of Rew, and ſtamp
it well with the yolks of Eggs and Honey, and
applying it Plaiſter wiſe, it will cure any old Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtume.</p>

Tail, which by degrees will eat, not only the
fleſh, but ſeize on the bone; ſo that it ſhall drop

this courſe: Take of green Copperas and Alom

Storax of each half an ounce, and of Deer-ſuet
half a pound; boil theſe together in an earthen
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:44463:120"/>
pot, &amp; when it is cold take Bitumen half a pound,
Bole-armoniack and of Coſtus of each one ounce
and a half; make all theſe into fine powder, then
mingle them with the former boiled Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients,
and boil them over again very well;
then take it off the fire, and pour this commix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
into cold Water, and afterwards make it
into rowls, like ordinary Salves.</p>
                  <p>When you have occaſion to make uſe of this
Salve, ſpread hereof on Leather, proportioning
the piece, ſo that it may cover the ſwelling all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and ſo lay it on; this will not only aſſwage
the ſwelling, but corroborate the Nerves and
Sinews; let it ſtick on as long as it can: If this
will not do, I know not what will, having tried
this medicine often, and having always found
it to work its cure, in bringing a ſwoln horſes
Leg to its priſtine ſmalneſs, when all other appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
proved ineffectual.</p>
                  <p>The French take this courſe for Legs that are
troubled with ſwellings.</p>
                  <p>They take a piece of ſtrong Woollen cloth,
very courſe, and thereof make an Hoſe to the
ſhape of his Leg, a pretty deal larger; ſo that it
may reach from the lower part of his Paſtern up
to the Cambrel, making it ſtrait at the Paſtern,
but wide above at the Knee; they then take a
pottle of Wine-lees (Beer-lees will ſerve) and boil
them well; then put to them a pound of clari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
Hogs-greaſe, when melted and well ſtirred
together, adding thereunto as much Wheat-bran
as will thicken it, reducing it to the body of
a Pulteſs, as hot as the Horſe can ſuffer it; hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
filled the hoſe or hoſen herewith, they then
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:44463:121"/>
cloſe it a top: thus letting him ſtand two days,
and on the third they open the hoſe at the top,
and pour therein molten Hogs-greaſe, very hot,
as much as it will hold, becauſe they ſay this will
renew the Pulteſs; then cloſe up the hoſe again,
and let him ſtand three days more; after this,
having rubbed the Horſes leg down very well,
if they find the ſwelling is not quite gone, they
will let him ſtand other two days, otherwiſe the
Cure is effected.</p>
                  <p>Now the hinder legs of an Horſe are occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to ſwell many times by the uneavenneſs of his
ſtanding, the floor being higher before than
behind; or elſe by ſetting up the Horſe in the
Stable too hot, and then taking cold, the blood,
greaſe and humours fall down into his hinder
legs.</p>
                  <p>For this I ſhall propound a cheap Cure: Take
Train-oil and warm it on the fire, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
twice a day, that is morning and evening,
anoint his Legs; but if there happen to be a
ſtiffneſs with the ſwelling, then take Violet-leaves,
Strawberry-leaves and Primroſe-leaves
of each an handful; boil all theſe in new milk
till they become very ſoft; then taking it off
the fire, add thereunto of the Oil of Nerval,
of Petroleum and of Pamphillion of each an
ounce; ſtir theſe together till they become
blood-warm, and herewith anoint the Legs,
Nerves, ſinews and Joints of the Horſe ſix or
ſeven days, chafing and rubbing in this Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
very well, and you ſhall work the Cure in
a little time.</p>

                  <p>You need not much enquire into the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms
of this diſtemper, being ſo viſible to the

dangerous and infectious.</p>
                  <p>The cure muſt be effected firſt by bleeding him

look raw and bloody, then tye him up to
the Rack ſo high that he may not be able to bite,

and Hogs greaſe tryed, the aforeſaid ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
being firſt beaten into fine powder, mingle
theſe well together, and thereof make an Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and that your Ointment may ſink in the
better, hold a hot bar of Iron near the Horſe
when you anoint him; having ſo done, be ſure
you waſh away clean this Ointment, ſo that none
remain, with the ſtrongeſt Chamber Lye you can
get; after this, untye him, and give him meat
as formerly; thus you muſt do once every day till
he be perfectly cured.</p>
                  <p>Or you may uſe this remedy, which is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
good for a Leproſie, but alſo any Farcy, Scab,

blood in the Neck, then take half a pound of
Tobacco, and infuſe it in a quart of old ſtale U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,
and then put it over a ſoft or ſlow fire, ſo
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:44463:122"/>
that it may only ſimper, and thus let it ſtand a

                  <p>Or you may uſe this means for the cure afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid,
which doth both draw, heal and make the

                  <p>Take a quart of Tar, and ſet it on the fire, then
adde to it half a pound of Bores greaſe, an Ounce of
Copperas, a quarter of a pound of Rozen, two Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Verdigreaſe, a quart of Linſeed Oyl, a quarter

your uſe.</p>
                  <p>When at any time you have occaſion to make
uſe of this Ointment, you muſt take thereof, and
making it warm, anoint therewith the Sorrance:
you ſhall not need to uſe it often before you ſhall
make a perfect cure.</p>
                  <p>If the Leproſie be univerſal, then firſt open
his Neck Vein, and draw good ſtore of blood
from thence, then with an Oyſter ſhell, Hare-cloth,
or ſome ſuch like courſe thing curry off
the ſcurf, then take of Verdigreaſe and Vinegar,
Cow-piſs, Train-Oyl, and old Urine, of each a

boil all theſe well together, and it will

                  <p>For Lice to afflict Horſes in great quantities is
as common as to have them in childrens heads,
eſpecially if the Horſe run in the Winter time in
Coppices, and among Trees where the drops
continually fall from the Trees upon his back;
theſe drops with his own poverty will breed them
infinitely; as long as he is troubled with theſe
Lice, which are very like Geeſe Lice, which
breed principally about the Ears, Neck, Main,
Tail, and will ſpread over all the body; I ſay, as
long as they infeſt him, ſo long will he be low, and
in a languiſhing condition.</p>
                  <p>The ſigns are, an Horſe will be always ſcrub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing,
ſcratching or rubbing himſelf againſt walls,
poſts or doors, or any thing elſe that will ſerve
for that purpoſe, fretting away thereby the hair
of his Mane and Tail; when the Sun ſhines you
will find then perching on the top of his hair,
and now although he ſhould eat never ſo much,
he will neither thrive nor proſper.</p>
                  <p>To cure him of this Itch, and free him from
theſe Vermine, you muſt take S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

boil it in running water, and waſh him all over
herewith, and it will deſtroy them.</p>
                  <p>Or take Soap and Quickſilver, or ſoft greaſe
and Quickſilver, and beat them together till the
Quickſilver be killed, and anoint the Horſe all
over therewith, and it will deſtroy the Lice in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly.</p>
                  <p>Or take Tobacco, and ſhred it very ſmall, and
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:44463:123"/>
with Alom powdered put it into ſmall Beer,
and when the Alom is diſſolved, waſh him

                  <p>Some ſay that Hogs-greaſe alone, anointing
the Mane and Ridge-bone of the back, will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
burſt them; But this (to conclude) I have
tried with deſired ſucceſs; that is, take a broad
woollen Liſt, as broad as your hand, that will
go round about his Neck; then wet or dip the
Liſt in Train oil, ſow it about his neck; this will
cauſe the Lice to gather to it, which will kill
them as faſt as they come: you may daub ſome
hereof about other parts of his body to ſave them
from a greater march, and it will deſtroy them in

                  <p>You muſt cure him after this manner; Take

                  <p>I have before diſcours'd concerning the Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lender,

the Low-worm; wherefore I ſhall particularly in
this place inſiſt upon the Mallender.</p>
                  <p>This Malady is a kind of a dry Scab, growing
overthwart the inward bent of the Knee, and
hath growing thereon ſtubborn hairs like Swines-briſtles,
which will corrupt and canker the fleſh,
cauſing him to go ſtiff till he is warmed by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
or exerciſe.</p>
                  <p>If you intend a Cure, you muſt firſt pull out
theſe briſtly hairs; then rub it dry with a cloth;
after this anoint it with Crown Sope and red
Mercury precipitate mixed together; dreſs him
herewith five ſeveral times, intermitting one day
betwixt every dreſſing; then anoint it with Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let-oil,
and you need do no more.</p>
                  <p>Others think this way better: Firſt waſh the
ſore clean with warm water, then ſhave off the
hair and pick away the ſcabs; after this take a
ſpoonful of Soap, and as much Lime, mingle them
together that it may be like Paſte; then ſpread
on a clout as much as will cover the Sore, and
bind it faſt on with a Liſt, renewing it every day
once the ſpace of 4 days; at the expiration of which
time, take away the Plaiſter, and take Oil of Roſes
warmed and anoint the ſore therewith, and that
will fetch off clearly all the ſcurf &amp; cruſty eſchar;
having removed this skurf, waſh, once a day, the
place with man's Urine, ſtrowing the powder of
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:44463:128" rendition="simple:additions"/>
burnt Oiſter-ſhells thereon; continue thus doing
till it be perfectly well.</p>
                  <p>The lateſt way of curing a Mallender is this;
firſt, with your Sciſſers clip away the hair that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
grows upon or about it; then take an hair-cloth,
or the back of an old Knife, and rub the
ſcabs off, which will cauſe a yellow matter to
run from it; then take a linnen cloth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
wipe the part very clean; then take a groats-worth
of the Oil of Riggrum and mingle it with
<hi>Stercus humanum;</hi> then lay on this with a flat
ſtick upon a piece of cloth, not woolen, and bind
it to the ſore, letting it lie on ſix days; then
cleanſe it and dreſs it once more, and there needs
nothing elſe to perfect the Cure.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, ſome only waſh and ſhave the Mallen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and then rub it with Piſs and Soap till it be
raw; then lay to it Nerve-oil, Honey and ſtrong

                  <p>Where note, that ſome Horſes will have two
Mallenders upon one Leg, one above the other,
and ſometimes one a little above the bending of
the Knee, and another a little below the inward
bending of the Knee; but as to the Cure it is all
alike, what being good for the one may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied

other weight or burden, by the hardneſs
whereof the place becomes galled: of all wrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,

moſt vile and dangerous, and if not taken in time
will prove a very difficult cure.</p>
                  <p>The ſigns are very apparent to the Eye, for the
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:44463:130"/>
fleſh will be puffed up and ſpungy, of a dark rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
complexion.</p>
                  <p>The ancient practice in the cure of this Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
was firſt with an Inciſion knife to cut away
all the dead and proud fleſh, then with a cauteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
Iron burn a hole about four inches lower
than the Navel Gall, putting a rowel of Horſe-hair
through it; then take the ſole of an old
ſhooe, or Oyſter ſhells, and burning them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
them into powder, and ſtrow all over the
ſore therewith; as you find the ſore grows moiſt
renew your application of more powder.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe receipts which are of later experience
are theſe: take Oyl <hi>de</hi> Bay, Coſtus, Fox greaſe,
Oyl of Savin, of each an Ounce, then take a
good quantity of great Garden worms, and ſcour
them with White-Wine and Salt, put all theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
ingredients into an earthen pot, and ſtop
them up very cloſe, thus boil them: having ſo
done, adde thereunto of Sallet Oyl one Ounce

boil it ſo long till you have brought it to a perfect
Ointment, after this ſtrain it into ſome clean veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,
and ſo preſerve it for your future uſe: when
at any time you have occaſion to dreſs therewith
this Sorrance called the Navel-Gall, take hereof,
and warm it; then take Lint or hurds, and dip
therein, anointing the ſore, and it will not be
long before it will be whole.</p>
                  <p>Or thus you may do: firſt take a ſharp knife,
and cut away the looſe skin, then anoint it with an
Ointment made of a ſpoonful of Dialthaea, a pint
of Train-Oyl, and about the quantity of a Pid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons
Egge of Verdigreaſe; this is a ſpeedy cure
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:44463:131"/>
for a Navel Gall of ſmall ſtanding; but if it be of
long continuance, ſo that the fleſh be hard, then
cut out the Cruſh, and with a Cauterizing Button
ſear the wound within, then take ſome fine Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
and dip it into ſome of the green Ointment
(the Receipt whereof I have already given you)
I ſay, with this Cotten ſo dipt tent the wound,
and the cure is not to be queſtioned.</p>
                  <p>If this hurt be newly gotten, and the skin
not broken, then only take cold Brandy Wine,
and with a rag dipt therein dab it on the ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and three or four times ſo doing or dreſſing
it will diſſipate or bring down the ſwelling.</p>
                  <p>This following receipt I have often tryed, and
do find it an excellent remedy againſt any Navel
Gall, Set-faſt, or ſore back whatſoever: take only
a quarter of a pint of Train Oyl, and as much
Verdigreaſe as the bigneſs of a Muſquet bullet
well beaten, mingle theſe together, and preſerve
them in a Gallipot for your uſe; the Sorrance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed
herewith will ſpeedily be healed, and
that which facilitates the Cure is, it kills all Flies
whatever as ſoon as they taſt of this Ointment.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding theſe excellent Receipts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

way to work; that is, they take the white

the dead fleſh, and then waſh it with Ale, But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

                  <p>Secondly, there are others which preſcribe
this method for the cure of an Over reach in the
heel, and that is, firſt cut out with your Inciſion
knife the Over reach, ſo that it may be very plain,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:44463:132"/>
and having waſht it with Beer and Salt, lay
thereunto a plaiſter made after this manner.</p>
                  <p>Take Oat meal and Butter, of each ſo much
as will make a Salve; put them in a Mortar, and
ſo incorporate them, then lay it to the Sorrance;
continue ſo doing once a day till the cure be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</p>
                  <p>Otherwiſe ſearch it well to the bottom, clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
it from all manner of Gravel, and waſhing
it clean with mans Urine, then take an handful
and an half of Nettles, and an handful and an
half of Salt; and putting them in a cloth, lay
them to the ſore; thus do three mornings toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and after that ſet the ſhooe on with a Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
under it, then pour in ſome Hogs greaſe
ſcalding hot, and a little after that ſcalding hot
Rozen; and laſtly, but preſently after that, put to
it ſome Wheat bran, and no doubt of a cure.</p>
                  <p>Or you may firſt waſh the Sorrance with water
and Salt, then take two big Onions, two ſpoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls
of Pepper beaten ſmall, of Crown ſope the
bigneſs of a Tennis ball, beat theſe together into
a Salve, and laying it on a linnen cloth, having
firſt dryed the foot, apply it, and remove it not
from thence, but once in a day and night, renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it in that manner ſtill till it be whole, but as
it heals do it ſeldomer.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, that which I have ever found to be an
excellent remedy for any Sinew ſtrain whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
is, take the whites of ſix Egges, as much
Bole Armoniack and Bean flower as by ſetting it
over the fire will become a Salve; take of this
when it is very hot, and Plaiſterwiſe lay it on the
Sinew-ſtrain, and round about the leg; you muſt
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:44463:133"/>
not omit ſo doing till all manner of ſwelling
thereabout be clean taken away.</p>

                  <p>As far as I can find, that skilful Artiſt Mr. <hi>Mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>

when writing in the praiſe hereof,
confeſſeth that he never could meet with it any

and that he would not uſe any other Oyl (if he
could come by this) in any internal adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whatſoever, having found the excellency
thereof by his own and other mens painful expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences:
thus it is made.</p>
                  <p>Take two Gallons of Milk, and being warm
over the fire, put thereunto four ounces of burnt
Allom, which will curdle it like a Poſſet, skim off
the Curd, and throw it to the Dunghill, but
ſtrain the Whey through a courſe cloth into a
clean Veſſel, then take a quarter of a peck of
Oats dry, and clean husked, and put them into
the Whey; but the Oats muſt not have been dryed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and then ſet the Whey over the fire, boiling
the Oats ſo long till they ſwell and break; then
take them off, and put the Oats into a Cullender,
that the Whey may gently drain from them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
preſſing; this done, put the Oats into fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
pan, and hold them over the fire, ſtirring
them ſo long till you ſee no fume to aſcend, then
ſuddenly take them off, and clap them into an
hard Preſs, preſſing them there exceedingly, what
comes from them is the Oil of Oats, which you
muſt reſerve in a glaſs very cloſely ſtopt.</p>

                     <pb n="251" facs="tcp:44463:133"/>
It ſtands with reaſon that this Oyl ſhould be

and made from the natural and moſt nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing

and give it an Horſe to drink, pouring in ſome of

cure him of the Glanders.</p>
                  <p>It is alſo the beſt of all Purgations, for it purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

                  <head>Poll-Evil in the Neck.</head>
                  <p>The Poll-evil is ſo called from its breeding in
the Poll behind the Ears, it is a great Swelling,
or apoſtumated Inflammation, and to ſay the
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:44463:134"/>
truth, let men give it what appellation they
pleaſe, it is more than a Fiſtula in Grain or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal.</p>
                  <p>The Cauſes of this Pole-evil are ſeveral: as firſt
from the Horſes ſtruggling in a new hard hempen
halter, or from a blow given behind the ears, by
reaſon of which bruiſe, the fleſh feſtering and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
inflamed, this loathſome Sorrance hath
its original; many times, bilious and malignant
humours invading that place do cauſe it.</p>
                  <p>The Signs are a tumour with Inflammation:
where note that the putrefaction is greater with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
than without, and therefore you muſt timely
think of letting out the corruption before it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to break of it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>As to the cure, you muſt lay unto the ſwoln
place whatever is mollifying, and will ripen it:
as for example, take Hogs greaſe, and lay there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
as hot as may be; or elſe take Loam of a
Mud wall, in which there is no Lime, by how
much the older it is, the better; boil hereof what
you think ſufficient in the ſtrongeſt White-Wine-Vinegar,
and let it boil to a Pulteſs, and apply
this very hot to the ſwelling, renewing it twice
a day till you have brought the ſwelling to ſuppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that it is fit to be laid open, then look where
it is ſofteſt, and with a Copper round inſtrument
(for that is better than any Iron) as big as a mans
little finger, and ſharp at the end, and being hot,
thruſt it in two inches beneath the ſoft place, ſo
that the point of your cauterizing inſtrument may
come out at the ripeſt place; by this means the
corruption will deſcend downward at the neather
hole, which you muſt keep open for the better iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:44463:134"/>
of the aforeſaid matter; to that end tent it
with Flax dipt in Hogs greaſe warm, laying
thereto a Plaiſter alſo of Hogs greaſe upon the
ſame, renew this every day once for five days
together; at the expiration of which time, take
half a pound of Turpentine very cleanly waſhed
in ſeveral waters, which when throughly dryed,
mingle therewith the Yolks of three Egges and a
little Saffron.</p>
                  <p>Now take your probe, and ſearch the bottom
of the wound, then make a Tent with a piece of
dry Sponge never dipt in water, ſo long as near
upon to reach the bottom, and ſo thick as it may
fill up the cavity, but before you put it in dip it
in the afore ſpecified Ointment; after this lay on
a Plaiſter of Hogs greaſe made indifferent warm,
changing your old Plaiſter for a freſh till you have
perfected the cure.</p>
                  <p>Or thus you may do; firſt, ripen the ſwelling,
then open it, and cleanſe it well from its matter
and corruption, then apply Hogs greaſe to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
the fire your Cauterizing Iron hath left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
it, then heal it after this manner.</p>
                  <p>Take of Hogs greaſe the quantity of a Tennis-ball,
Brimſtone beaten into the fine powder, with an
ounce of Quick-ſilver very well killed, and ſo
mingle theſe together that you have made them
into an Ointment, and anoint the ſwelling here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with:
having ſo done, take a penny worth of red
Tar, the reddeſt is the beſt, of Hogs greaſe half
a pound, of green Copperas and Bay Salt, of
each an handful, and pulverize them; then boil
theſe exceeding well, and as it comes ſcalding
hot off the fire, dip therein a clout faſtned at the
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:44463:135"/>
end of a ſtick and anoint or ſcald the ſore four
mornings together; for this ſcalding kills the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtula,
ſo that its future and further progreſs is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
hindered; after this you need only but to
warm the Tar, and apply it to the place, and the
Cure is conſummated.</p>
                  <p>Now there are ſome Farriers which cure the
Poll-evil only by firſt opening the ſore with an
hot cauterizing Iron, then taking red Lead and
black Soap, mingle them with water till they
are thick, and ſo tent the Horſe therewith till he
be whole.</p>
                  <p>But the beſt Remedy I have met withal, as a
general Cure for any Pole-evil whatſoever, is;
firſt, ſhave off the hair from the part that is ſwoln,
then lay thereon a Plaiſter of black Shoomakers-wax,
ſpred upon white Alom'd Leather, letting
it lie thereon till it have broken the Impoſtume;
then take better than a pint of ſtrong white
Wine-vinegar, and, when it is about to boil, put
therein as much Lome of a Mud-wall, ſtraws
and all, as will thicken it into a Poulteſs, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
this to the Sorrance, as hot as the Horſe
can ſuffer it; and by renewing it once a day
in a little time the Impoſtume will be whole.</p>

                  <p>There is little difference between the Pole-evil
in the Neck and the Pole-evil in the Head, only
there is a diſcrepancy as to their place: the
Cauſes and Symptoms of this diſtemper are much
alike. As to the Cure of the Pole-evil in the Head
take this method.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as you perceive a ſwelling, take pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
half an ounce of the oyl of Turpentine,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:44463:135"/>
and anoint therewith the part grieved, and that
it may the better ſink in, chafe it very well with
your hand, and ſo let it alone for four days, in
which time you will perceive the skin to ſhrink
up; ſeeing the ſwelling thus begin to abate and
come down, then take of Burgundy-pitch and
black Pitch of each an ounce and an half, and
with a ſlice daub or ſpread it over the ſwelling
in his forehead; but firſt you muſt melt them in
a Pipkin, with an ounce of Maſtich; having ſo
done, take flocks and lay them on thick upon the
place anointed, and ſo let them lie till they fall
off, which moſt uſually will be about three weeks;
now when the Plaiſter falls off, if you ſee no ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom
nor ſwelling remaining, you may conclude
you have done your work; but if the impoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
remain unbroken, then lance it, and cut
out what dead fleſh you find therein, filling the
cavity with Flax to dry up the blood and putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
ſuffering it to remain in that condition
ſeven or eight hours; then take it out, and lay
thereon ſome of that generally known Receipt
for a Canker in the Head, dreſſing it once a day;
if you make an hole at the edge of the ſwelling
below, it will heal much the ſooner: ſtill when
you take off your Plaiſter, mark (by looking on the
top of the Pole-evil) how far the proud fleſh reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
which will be white and like Jelly, and cut it
out with your Inciſion-knife, till you come to
the ſound red fleſh; ſpare not to cut it all out;
though from the fleſh and veins there flow a great
quantity of blood; but cut not, by any means,
the Pax-wax, which you ſhall plainly diſcern by
its whiteneſs. But you ſhall find a white pith
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:44463:136"/>
near the Pax-wax, which I would adviſe you by
all means to remove, and indeed it is no ways
difficult ſo to do; for if you will lay but your Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
to it, it will come away whole like a plugg;
having drawn it out, apply ſome of the Medicine
aforeſaid, and it will heal it up.</p>

                  <p>If an Horſe by chance, or negligence of the

when he goeth, by favouring that foot which is
offended; when he ſtands ſtill, by ſtanding a tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toe
on that foot.</p>

                  <p>If your Horſe be prickt by the careleſneſs or
ignorance of a Smith, and after the hurt receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:44463:137"/>
(you perceiving it not preſently) the place
rankleth and feſtereth in a very great meaſure: then
muſt you firſt open it very well to the very bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,
letting out all the corruption therein; ſearch
it be ſure as far as the Nail did go, and then
mundifie it; after this, take five or ſix Houſe-ſnails,
a little Salt, the quantity of a Walnut of
Soap, and beat theſe together, and lay this to
the foot that was prickt, a whole day and a night,
or longer, till you ſee it begin to heal, then dreſs
it but once in eight and forty hours: five dreſſings
will be ſufficient.</p>
                  <p>This pricking in the foot hath ſeveral names,
though they all import but one thing; as Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloyed,
Cloyd, Retrait and prickt; yet Mr. <hi>Mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
ſeems to make ſome difference between them,
of which I ſhall give you as brief an account as
Imay.</p>
                  <p>But firſt give me lieve to recount to you the
ſeveral general Cauſes, which happen very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
by the ignorance and unskilfulneſs of the
Smith in driving of his nails, whereby ſome are
broken, and not being immediately drawn out,
cauſed the part to feſter and impoſtumate; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the Horſe is injured by the weakneſs or
ill-pointing of the Nails.</p>
                  <p>Now if after the new ſhooing of your Horſe you
ſuſpect him prickt, yet cannot diſcover it by his
halting, ſearch his feet, and that foot which is
grieved, he will ſhrink up as ſoon as you have
laid your Pinſers to the place; for their nipping
will pain him to the quick. Or by knocking
with an Hammer on the top of the Clenches,
you will preſently diſcover which Nail it is that
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:44463:137"/>
hurts him. Now by reaſon of the anguiſh and
the pain he undergoes by this pricking, his foot
will be more hot that is hurt than the reſt; ſo
that if you take a pail of water and throw on his
feet, that foot grieved will be ſooner dry about
the hoof than the reſt.</p>
                  <p>Having diſcovered his Malady by theſe infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
Symptoms; firſt ſearch his foot very well;
then take of Goats-greaſe or rather Deers-ſuet,
if to be had, of Turpentine, Sallet-oil and new
Wax of each two ounces; melt theſe together,
and before you take it from the fire, put to it of
ordinary Honey three ounces, and of <hi>Sanguis
Draconis</hi> one drachm pulverized; work theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
one body over a ſlow fire, and make an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guent
thereof; take a good quantity hereof and
pour it into the Sorrance indifferently warm,
then ſtop it up with Towe or Hurds, and be ſure
that he tread in no cold water.</p>
                  <p>The French are ſo in love with this their own
experienced Remedy, that they will admit of
none elſe for the cure of a prick.</p>
                  <p>Having firſt ſearched and waſhed the Sorrance
very well, then they take Oil de Bay four ounces,
of Orfin, Cantharides &amp; Euphorbium of each two
ounces; make them all into fine powder, and
ſet it on a ſmall ſlow fire, ſtirring it till it become
an Ointment, with which they dreſs ths Sorrance;
and to ſpeak the truth, it is a very excellent and
ſpeedy Remedy.</p>
                  <p>Now it becometh every one that hath reſpect
for his Horſe, to be careful in the curing of this
ſame prick in the foot; for if it be not through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſearched, cleanſed and healed to the bottom,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:44463:138"/>
it will certainly break out about the Cronet or
top of the Hoof, ſo looſning the hoof round about
that it is ten to one but that the hoof will come
clearly off.</p>
                  <p>Now if you perceive that it begins to break
out above, make as large a vent as ſtands with
convenience to let out the corruption; and then
take of Bole-armoniack half a quartern, and of
Bean-flower as much, and with two Eggs beat
them ſo that they be well incorporated; then
ſpread it Plaiſter-wiſe and lay it round the Cronet,
binding it faſt on, and not removing it in eight
and forty hours; then you may take off the old
Plaiſter and put on a new one, continuing ſo to
do every other day till you find it grow firm and
hard above; for this Plaiſter will force the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
downwards, which you muſt extract by
Turpentine and Hogs-greaſe, until it leave run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
then take burnt Alom and pulverize it,
and with the powder thereof ſtrewed on the
ſore, with a few Hurds, dry and heal up the Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
                  <p>Again, ſometimes the thing, as Stub, Nail or
ſo forth, is gotten ſo far into the fleſh, that you
cannot fix any inſtrument thereon to draw it out;
then take a good quantity of black Soap, and lay
it to the place grieved one whole night, and it
will ſo draw it in that little time, as that you
may be able to lay hold thereon with a pair of
Nippers: the roots of Reeds ſtampt and mingl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Honey will draw out any Nail or Stub,
ſo will alſo black Snails ſtampt and incorporat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with freſh Butter: that being withdrawn
which was ſo offenſive to the foot of the Horſe,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:44463:138"/>
pour into the hole Oyl of Olive ſcalding hot;
when that hath lain ſo long there that it is cold,
pour into it Turpentine every whit as hot; after
half an hours time, take powder of Sulphur and
ſtrow thereon; then bolſter the Sorrance with
Hurds, and let no wet nor filth annoy it and it
will be quickly well.</p>
                  <p>The pricking in the foot is called a <hi>Retrait,</hi>
when in the driving of a Nail the point is ſo
weak, that inſtead of going forward, it bendeth
in the quick, the Nail being ſometimes hollow,
and then it ſhivereth in twain in the driving,

times is left behind; ſo that this Retrait is the
worſt of all pricks, in as much as the flaw canker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
by remaining in the foot.</p>
                  <p>This Sorrance is diſcovered, as other pricks are,
by groping the hoofs round with a pair of Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,

                  </p>
                  <p>The Cure is little different from thoſe which
appertain to all pricks; for what will cure one is
a Remedy in general for all; however for varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
take this one: having firſt with your Butteriſs
or Drawing-knife ſaid open the place grieved,
well-ſearching and cleanſing it: then take of
Turpentine and Tar of each an Ounce, of Pitch
and Beef-ſuet of each an ounce, and one head of
Garlick; boil theſe together, and lay it to the
Sore as hot as the Horſe can ſuffer it; if it ſhould
happen to break out above, the ſame medicine
will be a Remedy.</p>
                  <p>Cloying differs from a Retrait, in that the
whole Nail is ſtricken into the very quick of
the foot, remaining there clenched as the
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:44463:139"/>
other Nails: the diſcovery is as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.</p>
                  <p>As to the Cure you muſt inſtantly draw his
Shooe, and having found out the hole, preſently
take half a pound of Frankincenſe, a pound of
Roſin, and the like quantity of Pitch of Greece, half
a pound of black Pitch, one pound of new Wax,
one pound of Goats greaſe, half a pound of
Varniſh, half a pound of Turpentine, two ounces
of Oil Olive, and having melted theſe all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and incorporated them into one body; lay
it to the Hoof plaiſter-wiſe: this is a ſpeedy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
not only for any fort of Prick, whether
Cloy, Retrait or Accloy, but alſo for any cracks,
chinks, or clefts of the Hoof whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, firſt open his foot, then waſh it with
Salt and Vinegar; after that take of Honey and
Vinegar of each a like quantity, a little Oil, and
ſome Suet of an He-goat; ſet them over a ſoft

Pain in Horſes Teeth how remedied.</head>
                  <p>The Tooth-ach or pain in Horſes Teeth is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned
ſeveral ways; firſt by the falling down
of groſs humours from the head into the Teeth
and Gums; this Malady moſt afflicteth Horſes of
feweſt years, being very young and clotiſh; the
ſwelling and inflammation of the Gums doth
ſufficiently declare the nature of the Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
                  <p>Secondly an Horſe will have the Tooth ach,
when his upper Jaw-teeth are ſo over-grown, as
that they hang over the nether Jaw-teeth, cutting
and razing the inſides of his cheeks with their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
ſharpneſs.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly and laſtly, this pain may happen by
corruption of blood, which ſhall ſo weaken
and looſen his Teeth, that through their
tenderneſs he will not be able to chew his
meat.</p>
                  <p>The Cure of the firſt Tooth-ach, proceeding
from diſtillation of humours, is wrought by
rubbing all the outſide of the Horſes Gums with
fine Chalk and ſtrong Vinegar well incorporated
together: or elſe having waſhed the Teeth, as
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:44463:141"/>
aforeſaid, take powder of Pomegranate-pills and
ſtrow thereon; then take Rozin, Pitch and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtich,
and melting them together, lay it plaiſter-wiſe
to the Horſes Temples.</p>
                  <p>If his Tooth-ach proceed from the ſecond
cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the upper Jaw teeth overgrown and
ſo ſharp as that they cut the inſides of the cheeks,
then take your Gouge, and with a Mallet ſtrike
or cut thoſe teeth ſhorter gradually by little and
little, turning the hollow ſide of your Gouge to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Teeth, and ſo running them along
from firſt to laſt, then file them ſmooth from
all raggedneſs; having thus done, take water
and ſalt and waſh your Horſes mouth very well
therewith.</p>
                  <p>Now if the Tooth-ach proceed from the laſt
cauſe, that is to ſay, from the looſneſs of the
Teeth; then you may do well to let the Horſe
blood under the Tail, next the Rump; then
with Sage rub his Gums, or elſe, (which is much
better) waſh very well his mouth with Salt, Sage
and Honey beaten together, this will faſten his
Teeth; then give him in his provender the tender
crops of black Briars.</p>

the Fetlock and the Heel, from whence
iſſueth a fretting wateriſh humour; this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
uſually by the Lazineſs of the Groom or
Hoſtler, in not rubbing well the heels of an Horſe
after a journey in Winter time. And there are
no Horſes ſo ſubject to this diſtemper as thoſe
which have long hair on their Fetlocks; hence
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:44463:141"/>
comes that your Frizonds and Flanders Mares
(which are in ſuch great eſteem, among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of <hi>England,</hi> for the Coach) are very much &amp; of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
troubled therewith by the leaſt negligence of
the Groom; for the hair about the Paſterns being
always very long, the ſand and dirt gets into it,
fretting the skin and fleſh and ſo breedeth the
Scab.</p>
                  <p>The ſigns are, a palpable Scab, with an
hot wateriſh humour glitting from thence,
which in its paſſage ſcaldeth off the hair as it
goeth.</p>
                  <p>The Cure is, having firſt taken up the Shackle-veins
on both ſides; then take the ſoft roe of a
red Herring, Muſtard and black Soap; beat theſe
and incorporate them together, then boil them
in Vinegar till they become a Salve, and apply
it to the ſore: this is an admirable and ſpeedy
Cure.</p>
                  <p>Or elſe you may take a pound of Hogs-greaſe,
a penny worth of Verdigreaſe, two ounces of
Muſtard<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> half a pound of Oyl de Bay, a quarter of
a pound of Nerve-oil, half a pound of Honey,
half a pound of Engliſh Wax, one ounce of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenick,
two ounces of red Lead and half a pint
of Vinegar; boil all theſe together till you have
made an Ointment thereof: Having made the
ſore bare apply this ointment thereunto very
hot, renewing it once a day till the Cure be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated.</p>
                  <p>That Remedy which I have experienced to be
moſt efficacious is this: Take of Turpentine,
Hogs-greaſe, Honey and black Soap of each a
like quantity, and having molten them over a
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:44463:142"/>
ſlow fire, take them off, and add to them a ſmall
quantity of Bole-armoniack finely pulverized;
then as you work theſe together with a ſtick in
your right hand, ſo, with your left, pour in by
little Wheat-flower, which you muſt have in
readineſs by you, to make a compoſition as thick
as an Ointment. Having firſt cleared the ſore
of its hair, and made it raw, apply this Salve
thereunto, ſpred on a linnen cloth, renewing it
once a day till you have made a Cure.</p>
                  <p>There are yet other ſome who hold this for
an excellent Remedy for the Pains; and that is,
take Pepper, Garlick ſtampt, Coleworts and old

                  <p>The Quitter bone is an hard round ſwelling
upon the Cronet of the hoof betwixt the heel and
the quarter, and groweth moſt commonly on
the inſide of the foot; it is cauſed by ſome hurt
the Horſe hath ſuſtained in the foot, either by a
prick in ſhooing, by gravelling, which fretteth
inwardly, and forceth an Ulcer to break upward,
or by ſome ſtub or nail running into the foot as he
travaileth. Sometimes it cometh by a blow, or
by treading one foot upon the other; this Quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
bone is the moſt dangerous of all outward
Sorrances, and is known by a very apparent ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
which in leſs than ſix days will come to an
head, breaking, and then the matter or corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
will iſſue out of a ſmall hole, yet deep.</p>
                  <p>The cure is thus: cut the hoof open to the
quick, then take Galbanum Sagapenum, Pitch
of <hi>Greece,</hi> Olibanum, Maſtich, Oyl and White-Wax,
of each one Ounce with half a pound of
Sheeps ſuet: melt them upon a ſoft fire, and
work them well into a body, and dreſs therewith
the ſore until it be cured.</p>
                  <p>Or elſe do thus: as ſoon as you perceive the
nature of your Horſes Sorrance, that it is a Quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
bone, open it above if you find it ſoft, then
take Auripigmentum pulverized, and infuſe it
twenty eight hours into very ſtrong White-Wine
Vinegar, then lay it to the ſore, and it will ſo eat
about the Quitter bone, that with your Plyers
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:44463:143"/>
you may eaſily pluck it away; the bone or griſtle
being taken forth, heal up the wound with the
Copperas water and green Ointment, before pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
you in a preceeding Chapter.</p>
                  <p>Although a Quitter bone be far gone, and by
that means difficult to be cured, yet this is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
remedy. You muſt firſt take off a quarter of
the hoof right under the Quitter bone, ſo that
the corruption may have the freer paſſage; a part
of the hoof being off, lay in the place thereof a
piece of Hares skin to ſtop the blood, and there
let it lye twenty four hours without moleſtation,
then take it away, and waſh it with Wine and
Vinegar; now to the intent you may kill the
rankling, ſcald it with boiling hot Butter and
Salt boiled together; do this thrice, once every
other day; and it will not only hinder it from
feſtring, but hinder all manner of dead and proud
fleſh to grow in it.</p>
                  <p>Then take of Verdigreaſe the quantity of a
Pidgeons Egge pulverized, a quarter of a pint of
White-Wine-Vinegar, and as much Honey, boil
theſe together with the Verdigreaſe, all the time
it boils you muſt be careful that you continually
ſtir it for about half an hour, then take it off and
preſerve it in a clean veſſel, and therewith eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day anoint the Sorrance till it be well; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
cured the Sorrance, then muſt you recover
the hoof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is done by taking Tar, Tallow,
Turpentine, and Dogs greaſe boiled together;
let not the Turpentine be put in till you are about
to remove it from the fire; if poſſibly you may
forbear, take not off the whole hoof becauſe it
will require a long time to produce another, but
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:44463:143"/>
anoint the torn hoof herewith; and if any thing
will bring a new piece in the place of the old this
will do it.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Italian</hi> cureth this Malady thus: he firſt
opens the ſore, then he puts into it Salt of Tartar,
and having quite eaten away the Quitter bone,
he taketh Honey and Verdigreaſe, and boiling
them together healeth it up therewith.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>French</hi> put Arſnick into the hole of the
Quitter bone, letting it lye there a day and a
night, ſtopping up the mouth thereof very cloſe;
if after opening it the cavity look black within it
is concluded, the Arſnick hath wrought its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign:
then to allay the fire, and reſtore the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
fleſh, they take Hogs greaſe and Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,
and having melted them together they tent
the wound therewith: being ſuſpicious that the
Core is not eaten away or removed; then make
a Plaiſter of Pitch, Rozen, and Wax, of each a
like quantity, and of Turpentine as much as all
the reſt; being ſure that the Griſtle is conſumed,
then heal it up with this Unguent: take of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Honey and Verdigreaſe powdred, of each
<hi>quantum ſufficit,</hi> boil theſe till it be red and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
tent the wound till it be whole; with this
caution, that you keep the mouth of the wound
open till you are aſſured that it is healed at the
bottom.</p>
                  <p>If it be your chance at any time to meet with a
Quitter bone that hath paſſed through a great
many Farriers hands, by whoſe want of skill it
hath been poiſoned in ſuch ſort, that the Paſtern
hath been much ſwelled; if ſo, the firſt thing
you muſt do is to take up the Vein on that ſide of
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:44463:144"/>
the Leg, on which the Quitter bone groweth,
to keep the humour back which affords it ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
then put in the quantity of a Bean of Arſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick
to eat out the Core of the Quitter bone;
where note that a Quitter bone is difficulty cured
if you take not up a Vein; and when the Core is
out you muſt firſt waſh it well with White-Wine-Vinegar
and Salt before you heal it up.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, here followeth a very good receipt,
neither troubleſome nor coſtly in the compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
firſt, take Hogs greaſe and Verdigreaſe
pounded together, and tent therewith the Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
for a day or two, then pour into the hole
ſcalding hot Hogs greaſe, then lay a plaiſter of
Pitch and Tar mixt over it for twenty four hours,
if the bone riſe not in that time do it once more,
and it will riſe.</p>

                  <head>Ring bone.</head>
                  <p>A Ring bone is at firſt a certain ſlimy humour
and viſcous, which reſorting to the bones of their
own nature cold and dry, cleave thereunto, and
become hard, griſtly, nay abſolutely bony; its
ſcituation is ever upon the Cronet of the hoof.</p>
                  <p>The cauſes hereof are twofold, either natural
or accidental; naturally, when either the Mare
or Stallion have it from whom the Colt proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;
and though I never ſaw a Colt bring a Ring-bone
into the World with it, yet Mr. <hi>Markham</hi>
avoucheth, he hath ſeen many Foals foaled with
Ring bones on the feet; wherefore I ſhall adviſe
you not to breed upon any ſuch Stallion or Mare
that either have had or have this Malady. Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally,
this happens ſeveral ways; firſt, by
ſome blow or ſtroak on the foot, or elſe from
ſome evil humour deſcending, and ſetling upon
the Cronet.</p>
                  <p>The Symptoms hereof are apparent to the eye,
the Cronet of the hoof will be much ſwoln, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
that part which is next adjoining unto the
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:44463:145"/>
lower part of the Paſtern, the hair thereabout
will grow briſtly, and ſtare, and the Horſe will
go lame.</p>
                  <p>The Cures are ſeveral, but I ſhall preſcribe you
none here but what have been many times expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimented
with welcome ſucceſs. Firſt, ſcarifie
the skin above the Ring bone with a Lancet, then
take a great Onion, and pick out the Core, then
take Verdigreaſe and unfleckt Lime, and put them
therein, then cover up the hole, and in hot em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
roaſt it till it be ſoft, then take it and bruiſe
it well, and being very hot lay it to the ſorrance;
do thus five days together, you will not miſs of
a cure.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>Another way to cure it.</head>
                  <p>Firſt caſt your Horſe, or tye up his contrary leg
with a ſtrong rope, till you ſtrike five or ſix holes
in the Ring bone at the very edge of it; let the
holes be equally diſtant from each other, then
take Arſnick, and upon the top of your Fleim
put ſome thereof into every hole, then bind up
his foot for a night and a day.</p>
                  <p>But that which <abbr>Eſq</abbr> 
                     <hi>Grey</hi> preſcribeth as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
is this, take unfleckt Lime newly taken
from the Kill well burned, which you may know
by its lightneſs, pulverize this Lime, and lay it
thick upon the place ſwelled, with a linnen cloth
bound about it to keep it on, then let him ſtand
in cold water an indifferent while; then taking
him forth, unbind the foot, and he is certainly
cured, for the burning of the Lime doth kill the
Ring bone even to the very root thereof; this is
a truth throughly experimented.</p>

only inſert three or four, which I have found the
beſt of any I have tried in above 45 years practice.</p>
                  <p>1. Take of the buds or tendereſt tops of El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-leaves
one handful, firſt ſhred, then pound
them in a Stone-mortar very well, till you bring
them to a Salve; this is for preſent uſe, and you
muſt apply it to the Sore with a linnen cloth,
binding it ſo on that it ſhall not fall off.</p>
                  <p>2. Take of common Honey two ounces, Roch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alom,
Verdigrieſe and Vinegar of each one ounce;
you muſt pulverize the Alom and Verdigrieſe,
then take of Sublimate finely powdered two
ounces; boil theſe together a very little, and
then take it off, uſing it as you ſhall find occaſion.</p>
                  <p>3. Take of hard Rozin and Peroſen of each
two pound, of Virgin-wax, Frankincenſe and
Sheep-ſuet of each one pound, of old tried
Hogs-greaſe two pound; boil the Gums and
Wax in a pint of white Wine, and then put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it the Sheep-ſuet and Hogs-greaſe, and when
all is well molten and wrought into a body, ſtrain
it, and whilſt it is yet hot, put thereto of <hi>Venice</hi>
Turpentine two ounces; work all theſe together
and keep it for your uſe.</p>
                  <p>4. Take tried Hogs-greaſe 1 pound, Verdigrieſe
finely powdered 2 penniworth; let theſe take 3 or
4 walms over the fire; then take it off, and put to it
of Venice Turpentine one Ounce, ſtir theſe all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether

                  <head>Shoulder Sorrances what they are with their Cures,
and firſt of the Shoulder-wrench.</head>
                  <p>The ſeveral ſorts of Sorrances which happen
to the ſhoulder, are either diſcoverable by the
eye, or to be felt by the hand: now as to
the Shoulder Wrench it is diſcoverable to both.</p>
                  <p>It cometh of ſome dangerous ſlipping or ſliding,
or of too ſudden ſtopping on the Gallop, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Cure is to take Wheat meal two pound,
and put it into ſome red Wine, ſetting the Poſnet,
wherein they are, over the fire; then take Bole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armoniack
finely pulverized half a pound, of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Honey one pound; boil all theſe together
and, when boiled, add to them of Pitch half a
pound, and ſo keep them ſtirring till the Pitch
be throughly melted, and as you are about to
take it off the fire, put thereunto half a pound
of ordinary Turpentine, of Cummin, Oil de
Bay, <hi>Dialthaea, Sanguis Dracunis,</hi> Bay-berries, Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nugreek,
Linſeed-flowers of each two ounces;
make all theſe into fine powder; then take an
ounce of the Oil of Aſpick; boil and mix theſe
very well together; that done, charge the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
therewith down to the Knees; this is a
ſovereign Remedy for Shoulder wrenches,
Knees or Hips, it comforteth the Sinews, it
bringeth down ſwellings, and is very good againſt
Kibes and Scratches.</p>
                  <p>Yet if this receipt ſhould not anſwer your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation

rowel him from the nether part of the Spade-bone
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:44463:148"/>
down to the point of his Shoulder; which
done, ſet a patten ſhooe upon the ſound foot, and
ſo turn him to graſs for about a month, ſtirring and
removing every other day the Rowels, thruſting
out the matter; as ſoon as you perceive he goes
ſound take off the patten ſhooe and Rowels, and
let him run a little longer to graſs, and he will be

the Horſe will halt downright.</p>
                  <p>This way you may effect the Cure: Firſt, caſt
him upon that ſide which hath not the Shoulder
diſlocated; then faſten with a Cord the foot of
the ſame leg all along a board, and that again to
ſome tree-or poſt, about three paces from the
Horſe; whilſt this is extended, let one with
a pail of cold water bathe and waſh the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>located
member with his hand, in ſo doing,
he muſt take up that member which he muſt
chafe from the top to the further end of the
leg, by ſo doing the bone will be reduced to its
proper place; that done, raiſe him very gently,
and then let him blood in the Breaſt-vein, on that
ſide the member is diſlocated; then put on a

forefeet be trammelled above a fortnight after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,

anoint his ſhoulder therewith: this Remedy ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

                  <p>But the way of late much practiſed is to lay good
ſtore of ſtraw under the horſe; then put on his fore-legs
a pair of Paſterns, and the like on his hinder,
then having thrown him on his back, hang him by
the legs from the ground with two ropes drawn
over ſome beam or other thing convenient for
that purpoſe; this will reſettle the bone in its

ſoftly, looſe the fore Paſtern of the ſound
leg, and with a Cord before you let him riſe,
tie the ſame leg to the foot of the manger, ſo
ſhort, as in his riſing he ſhall be forced to hold
his leg before him, for fear of putting his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
out of joint; let him ſtand ſo three or four
days; as ſoon as he is up burn all the point of
his ſhoulder with an hot Iron Chequerwiſe a

burned places, and the whole ſhoulder with Pitch,
Rozin and Tar melted together, laid on very
hot, and clap flox of the colour of the Horſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it; then charge him again over the flox: at
three days end looſe his foot, and put a pair of
Paſterns on his feet; then ſuffer him not to
lie down for twenty days, after that walk him
out, if he go not well, give him as much more reſt.</p>

                  <p>I have already diſcourſed of the Shoulder-wrench
and Shoulder pight; it now falls in my
way to treat of the Shoulder-ſplat: but firſt give
me lieve to give you the difference between them.</p>
                  <p>The Shoulder-wrench commonly is occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:44463:149"/>
by ſome ſlip, or by making the Horſe to make
too ſudden a ſtop upon falſe ground, or by ſome
fall, or by too ſhort turning: Shoulder-pight
cometh by ſome bruſh, ſtrain or fall, which the
Horſe received by a leap, ſtroke or bruiſe againſt
ſome hard thing, whereby the member is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>located.</p>
                  <p>Now the ſhoulder-ſplat is when by ſome dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
ſlip or ſlide upon ſome ſlippery or yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ground, the horſe hath his ſhoulder
parted from the breaſt, tearing the fleſh from
the Brisket, leaving an open cleft in the fleſh,
not in the skin, which cauſeth a balk to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath
the body, which will afterwards ſwell;
hereupon the Horſe will not only halt, but draw
his leg after him; that is a ſufficient Symptom to
know the Shoulder-ſplat by.</p>
                  <p>Now as to the Cure: firſt put a ſtrait pair of
Paſterns on his forefeet; then take of Dialthea
one pound, of Sallet-oil one pint, of Oil de Bay
half a pound, and of freſh Butter half a pound;
melt all theſe ingredients together in an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
pot, and anoint the Sorrance therewith,
and alſo round about the inſide of the ſhoulder;
about three days after, at fartheſt, both the Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and all the ſhoulder will ſwell; then with
a Lancet prick all thoſe ſwoln places, (you may
uſe a ſharp hot Iron) and having ſo done, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oint
it again with the Ointment aforeſaid; but
if you ſee the ſwelling will not be aſſwaged, but
that it cometh to ſuppuration; then lay it open
in that place where is the greateſt ſwelling and
is ſofteſt; having ſo done, tent it with Flax
dipt in Turpentine and Hogs-greaſe melted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:44463:150"/>

take it off, and when it is indifferently cooled,
take a ſtick, and bind thereto ſome Flax, and

over therewith; after that take Flax, as near as
you can of the ſame colour of the Horſe, and lay
them on the Charge, obſerving every other day
to take out the Rowels, and having cleanſed them,
place them as before; thus you muſt do for at

which I have particularly diſcourſt, however I
would not have you judge me either tautological
or impertinent if I inſiſt upon this Sorrance called
the Scratches; a Sorrance which ingendreth about
the heel and Paſtern joint, being long, ſcabby,
and dry chaps or rifts growing overthwart on
the hinder legs, juſt from the Fetlock to the end
of the Curb: now this Sorrance may grow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

                  <p>For the cure hereof, any of thoſe Medicines a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
preſcribed againſt the Pains or Mules are
good for the Scratches: yet for the better effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

take what followeth, which are more proper for
this Sorrance.</p>
                  <p>Firſt rub the Sorrance till it bleed, and be raw,
then take Hogs greaſe and black Soap, of each
half a pound, and boil theſe together; then take
of Brimſtone, Lime, and Gunpowder, of each
three Ounces, beat theſe into fine powder, and
put therein, adding as much Soot as will thicken
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:44463:152"/>
it; incorporate theſe well together, and make a
black Ointment, and therewith anoint the Sores
dayly.</p>
                  <p>If the Scratches are held incurable, then firſt
bleed him in the Shackle Veins, Spur Veins, and
fore Toe Veins, intermitting three days between
the bleeding of one Toe and the other; having
ſo done, make the Sores raw as before, then take
a quart of old Urine, and a quart of ſtrong Brine,
and put to them eight Ounces of Alom, boil theſe
to a quart, whilſt very hot waſh the Sores there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
then take the ſperm of Frogs and put it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

                  <p>For ordinary Scratches, take a penny worth of
Verdigreaſe, a penny worth of Red Lead, and

                  <head>Surbating of Horſes.</head>
                  <p>Thoſe Horſes which are moſt ſubject to this
Malady are ſuch as have either great round feet,
or ſuch as are flat footed, the Coffins whereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very weak and tender.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="290" facs="tcp:44463:153"/>
Now Surbating proceedeth from two ſeveral
cauſes: the firſt is, when the Horſe is but newly
backt, and ſhod, the owner by his indiſcretion
and impatience, immediately rides him a long
journey; now his feet being but tender, and too
ſoon expoſed to hard and ſtony ways, the Horſe
becomes ſurbated. The ſecond cauſe is when an
Horſe hath naturally bad feet, or that he is ill ſhod,
his ſhooes either lying too flat, too narrow, too
ſhort, and too much worn, or ſometimes by go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
too long bare foot.</p>
                  <p>The ſigns are, the Horſe will halt much, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
creeping and ſtiff; if he got his grief by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail,
when ſtanding in the ſtable he will always
be removing his feet, not knowing where to
place them by reaſon of their great ſoreneſs: this
will cauſe him to lye down much, for his ſtanding
will be exceeding painful, and if you feel the Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fins
of his hoofs, you will find them very dry, and
burn much.</p>
                  <p>There are ſeveral ways to cure Surbating:
ſome take off the Horſes ſhooes, and pare him a
very little, then they ſee whether the ſhooes be
not long, large and hollow enough, if they be
not ſo they make them ſo, for otherwiſe they
will never be eaſie, then tack them on again; and
when they have ſo done they take Hogs greaſe
and Bran boiled together, and being very hot,
they ſtop his feet therewith, covering the Coffin
round about therewith, binding all in together
with a cloth and a liſt faſtned about the joint, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing
it once a day till it be ſound, obſerving
to let him ſtand dry, and that he drink warm
water during the cure.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="291" facs="tcp:44463:153"/>
If your Horſe ſurbat or ſolebat by going with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſhooes, then firſt pare him pretty cloſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Toe, then with the point of a Pen-knife,
cut a little hole through the bottom of the
hoof, about half an Inch from the Toes end,
right over the Vein, and let the Vein bleed a
quarter of a pint, then ſet on his ſhooes indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
hollow within the feet; then boil Tar, Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
and Turpentine together, and pour it into
the ſurbated foot ſcalding hot, and ſtuff in Wool
after it to keep it in; once or twice at the fartheſt
ſo doing will perfectly cure him.</p>
                  <p>If he ſurbate in his journey ſo that you fear he
will not perform it, as ſoon as you perceive it,
get him to his Inne with what convenient ſpeed
you may, then take two new laid Egges, and
having firſt well picked his fore feet, break them
raw into the Soles, and then ſtop them up with
Oxe or Cow dung; or during the time of his
journey, if you ſtop his feet with Cow dung and
Vinegar every night, he will be well next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
nay, if he be not ſurbated it is good to ſtop
his feet with Cow-dung, for it will keep them
cool.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, if your Horſes feet be ſurbated either
by travail, too near paring, or any other acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
then take a good lump of courſe Sugar,
and with an hot Iron melt it between the ſhooe
and the foot; and when it is hardned, take Net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
and Bay Salt and ſtamp them, and ſo ſtop up
the frog of the foot.</p>

iſſueth out of the throat Veins into thoſe parts;
and this happens by ſome Cold taken in Winter,

                  <p>The Sorrance it ſelf is an hard and great ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
between the Horſes neather chaps, upon

remedied will indanger the choaking of the
Horſe.</p>
                  <p>The ſigns hereof are hanging out of the tongue,
lolling it to and fro his mouth, the Horſes head
and eyes will be ſwoln, and his Temples will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
very hollow, his breath will be very ſhort
by reaſon of the ſtopping of the paſſage of his
throat.</p>
                  <p>The Cure of this Diſtemper according to the
judgment of the moſt experienced is to let him
blood in the neck Vein: after that to bring the
ſwelling to ſuppuration they make a ripening
Plaiſter after this manner: take of Mallows,
Linſeed, Rue, Smallage, and ground Ivy, of
each a quantity alike, boil theſe together in the
grounds of Beer, then adde to it ſome Oil <hi>de</hi> Bay,
and a ſmall quantity of Dialthaea, taking it off
the fire, make thereof a plaiſter, and lay it to the
place grieved, but ſuffer him not in any caſe to
drink cold Water; this Plaiſter will ripen and
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:44463:154"/>
break the ſwelling, then lay thereunto Bran
ſteept in Wine, renewing it dayly till it be
whole.</p>
                  <p>But of all Cures there is none experience bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
approveth of than this.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as you ſee the ſwelling riſe between
his chaps, then take a Wax candle, and hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it cloſe to the ſwelling, burn an hole quite
through the skin, then lay thereunto wet Horſe-Litter,
that will both ripen and break it; then
only lay a plaiſter of Shoomakers Wax thereunto,
and that will both draw and heal it.</p>
                  <p>But if it happen to break inwardly, ſo that
the corruption iſſueth through his noſe, there
being no external running of the matter, then
perfume his head twice or thrice a day by burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
under his Noſtrils Frankincenſe or Maſtick,
you may uſe inſtead thereof a Cole of fire put into

                  <p>The ſigns hereof will be very apparent, for the

down-right.</p>
                  <p>There are three Cures which I only approve of
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:44463:155"/>
for their ſafety and expedition, and therefore I
ſhall nominate no other; the firſt is,</p>
                  <p>Take three pints of ſtale Urine, and ſeeth it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
a quarter of an hour; when you find that
the foam doth riſe apace, then take it from the fire
and ſtrain it, and adde thereunto an handful of
Tanſie, one handful and an half of Mallows,
and about three ſpoonfuls of Honey, with nigh
half a pound of Sheeps ſuet, then ſet them on the
fire, and let them boil together till the herbs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
ſoft; being very hot, lay this Poulteſs to
the joint, and bind it on with a cloth; a fourth
dreſſing will perfectly cure the ſtrain.</p>
                  <p>The Second is, firſt to take of Dialthaea half a
pound, the like quantity of Nerve Oil; chafe this
Oil well in with your hand, continuing ſo to do,
till you have none of the Ointment left; if this
ſhould chance to fail your expectations, reinforce
the cure, by taking Nerve Oil, black Soap, and
Pompillion, of each an equal quantity, and only
warm them over the fire, and therewith anoint
the joint; I never knew this Medicine deceive
me.</p>
                  <p>Now the laſt is this: take a Maſtive ſucking
Whelp which is very fat, kill him and take out
his guts, then take gray ſnails and black ſnails as
many as will fill the belly, and ſowing it up, roaſt
him at an indifferent ſoft fire, then baſte him with
Oil of Spike made yellow with Saffron, with the
Oil of Wax, of each two Oils let there be five
ounces; let the Dog continue at the fire as long
as any one drop will fall, and preſerve the drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings
in a Gallipot; with this Ointment anoint
the joint morning and evening, working it in

very hot, holding a red hot flat Iron, to make it
ſink in.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, take off his ſhooe, and pare him thin al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
to the quick; then make a Pulteſs of theſe
ingredients following, and lay it hot to his foot:
Take a pint of Brine, wherein Beef or Pork hath
been ſalted, and four ounces of Kitchin-ſtuff;
boil theſe together near half an hour, then add
thereunto ſome Wheat-flower, and make there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

<pb n="296" facs="tcp:44463:156"/>

and the upper end of the great Hough-bone of
the hinder-leg. Now every hurt in the ſtifling-bone,

in the ſtifle.</p>
                  <p>The ſymptoms of his being ſtifled are, the bone
will ſtick out more on the one ſide than the other,

                  <p>Cure him thus: Set a Patten-ſhooe on his ſound

him looſe where he may have freedom to

with freſh butter.</p>
                  <p>Or thus you may do; as ſoon as you perceive

take your Horſe to ſome deep Pond, Mill-pool
or River that hath an eaſie entrance, and ſwim
him up and down for half an hour, till he ſweat
behind the ears, at which time, or before, the
bone will be reduced to its natural place. Thus
you may do if your Horſe ſhould chance to be

                  <p>If it ſo happens that your Horſe is not ſtifled,

of red Wine-Vinegar, eight Eggs beaten, ſhells

as much Venice Turpentine, three pints of flower,
and more than a good handful of Bay-ſalt; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate
theſe well together and put them
into a pot, keeping it cloſe one night, the next

                  <p>Stumbling in an Horſe is ſo ill a property,
that I know not what well can be worſe; for a

neck. This infirmity happens many ways, and

                     </gap>imbs with that dexterity and agility he
ought.</p>
                  <p>Accidentally an Horſe is given to ſtumbling,
by a Splint, Ridg-bone, Wind-galls or ſome
hurts in the foot, as ſoundred, prick'd, gravelled,
ſinew-ſprained, ſhoulder-wrenched, or pinch'd in
the Withers.</p>

                     <pb n="299" facs="tcp:44463:157"/>
The beſt Cure for natural Stumbling is to cut
a ſlit upon the very top of the Noſe, and with
your Cornet take up the two great Sinews, which
there reſide, and cut them aſunder, and after
heal up the place with ſome healing medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
this will give him the perfect uſe of his
legs in ſo ample a manner, as that he will never
trip or ſtumble after, unleſs by ſome great
chance.</p>
                  <p>Neither will you do amiſs, if you breed a
young Horſe or purchaſe one, immediately after
backing him, to cut him of the Cords, that is, theſe
two great Sinews, and you will find the benefit
ever after, mentioned in the aforeſaid Cure of
Stumbling.</p>
                  <p>But if his ſtumbling happens accidentally, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Cauſes already declared; then
take of Hogs-greaſe one pound, of freſh Butter,
<hi>Althaeae</hi> and of Oil de Bay of each eight ounces;
mix theſe, and work them together, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
anoint and chafe the legs and ſinews of the
Horſe thrice a day, every third day, and be ſure
that his ſhooes be wide enough, eſpecially at the
heels.</p>
                  <p>The ſinews being well ſuppled, you may put
him alſo out of the Cords.</p>
                  <p>Where note that theſe Cords are flat white
Sinews lying under a red film, extending them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
from the top of the noſe to the hind-legs,
which when you ſhall take up with your Cornet,
and having hold of them, if you will pull hard,
you may almoſt pull the Horſes hind-legs to his
fore-legs.</p>

                  <p>If your Horſe be well coloured, and, for a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ornament to his body, you would have a
Star that is white in his forehead, you muſt make
uſe of Art in this manner: Take Sheeps-milk
and ſet it over the fire, when it is well ſod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
take a cloth and dip therein; then take it
out of the milk boiling hot, and clap it to the
Horſe's forehead, doing it ſo often till you can
rub off the hair with your finger; after this,
every day, lay ſome milk to the bald place luke-warm,
till the hair grow again.</p>
                  <p>If that will not do this, uſe this infallible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment:
Take a ſharp long Bodkin, and as
long as you would have the Star, ſo far upwards
thruſt the Bodkin between the skin and the bone,
hollowing the skin as you thruſt it; then take
ſome Lead, and make it into the ſame form the
Bodkin is of, and having withdrawn your Bod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin,
let the Lead in the ſame hole ſupply its

put it underneath the four corners of the Lead,
and by drawing it ſtrongly you will contract the
hollow skin to a purſe; having drawn it well
together, let it reſt a day and a night, in which
time the skin will be ſo deadned, that it will not,
when looſned, return to its former place; after
this remove the Leaden pins, and with your hand
cloſe the skin to the forehead; in a little time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

                  <p>This I know true likewiſe by my own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
take a Crab and roaſt it, and, being exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive

                  <head>Swelling of the Neck after Phlebotomy.</head>
                  <p>There is a four fold cauſe of the ſwelling of
an Horſe's Neck after breathing a Vein.</p>
                  <p>1. When the Vein is ſtruck through, ſo that
ſome of the blood getting between the fleſh and
the Vein, it there putrefieth and corrupteth, and
by that means is ingendered an Impoſtumation.</p>
                  <p>2. It hapneth ſometimes by the careleſneſs of
a ſlovenly Farrier, who without looking on his
Fleim, having not let blood in a pretty while,
never obſerved that it was ruſty, and ſo ſtriking
the Vein therewith, the Vein rankleth; and this
I can aſſure you is very dangerous.</p>
                  <p>3. This may come by cold ſuddenly ſtriking
into the Orifice.</p>
                  <p>4. And laſtly, by permitting the Horſe, too
ſoon after blood-letting, to hang down his head
to feed or graze; this will cauſe an attraction
or reſorting of humours to that place, which
in a very ſhort time will turn to an Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtume.</p>

You need no other Cure for it but this: take
Oil of Camomile and warm it, then therewith
anoint the ſwelling; then lay upon it ſome Hay
wet in water, ſo binding it, that it may not eaſily
fall off; put freſh wet Hay or Litter every day for
ſix or ſeven days, in which time it will be either
diſcuſt or brought to ſuppuration; if brought
to an head and throughly ripened, then with
your Lancet lay it open and let out the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
having cleanſed it very well, take flax and
dip it in Turpentine and Hogs-greaſe melted
together, tenting it therewith, and by dreſſing
it thus every day, it will be whole and perfectly

their location, the Splint being ever on the inſide

leſs dangerous than the other.</p>
                  <p>Now by reaſon that ſeveral Horſes have been

                  <head>Suppoſitories of all ſorts, with their uſes.</head>
                  <p>There are certain malignant humours in the
body of an Horſe, which the ſtrength of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:44463:164"/>
cannot expel, and therefore muſt be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
three ſeveral ways by Art, either by
Potion, Clyſter or Suppoſitory; of the two firſt
I have already ſuccinctly diſcourſed, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I ſhall only treat of the laſt which is a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitory,
and this Suppoſitory is no more than an
Handmaid or Preparative to a Clyſter; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the nature of a Clyſter is to open, yet can
it not perform its office many times, by reaſon of
the hardneſs of the Excrements, by reaſon of a
dry, hot and coſtive conſtitution; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
to ſoften the Guts, there ought to be as
a forerunner, the application of a Suppoſitory,
before either Potion or Clyſter be adminiſtred.</p>
                  <p>Thus as we have related the Nature and uſe
of Suppoſitories, ſo in the next place it will be
requiſite to give you ſome Receipts in the due
forming and compoſing any Suppoſitory.</p>
                  <p>The firſt and moſt gentle of all Suppoſitories
is this: Take a great Candle, of four to the pound,
and cut it into twain; then take the lower or
bigger part and anoint it with freſh Butter, and
ſo thruſt it into his Fundament; as ſoon as you
have ſo convey'd it, hold his Tail to his Tuel
three quarters of an hour, by which time the
Candle will be melted; after this let looſe his
Tail, and ride him preſently, I mean trot him up
and down till he begin to evacuate; thus by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing
him after the adminiſtration of the
Suppoſitory, you will cauſe it to work the more
kindly.</p>
                  <p>But if ſo be your Horſes conſtitution be ſo
weakned and debilitated that you durſt not give
him any purging Medicament, then take of Salt-Nitre
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:44463:165"/>
three ounces, of Honey half a pound, of
Wheat-flower, Anniſeeds finely powdered, of
each two ounces; boil theſe together to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency,
and make it into Suppoſitories, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
one of them at a time into the body of the
Horſe, as you were before directed, giving him
the ſame manner of exerciſe.</p>
                  <p>If you would purge Phlegm, this is a moſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
and approved way: Take a piece of Caſtle-ſoap,
and with your knife ſhape it into the uſual
form of a Suppoſitory; and apply it according to
the former directions.</p>
                  <p>Now ſince I have ſpoken of the Purgation of
Phlegm, give me lieve to proceed in my giving
inſtructions, by ſuch like means, how to correct
the malignity or redundancy of the other three
humours or Conſtitutions.</p>
                  <p>And firſt as for Choler, uſe this Suppoſitory:
take of Saven an indifferent quantity, of Staves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aker
and Salt of each two ounces; Stamp theſe
well together, and boil them in ſo much Honey
as may make them of that thickneſs fit for the
compoſition of Suppoſitories, and at your pleaſure
apply them as before.</p>
                  <p>For Melancholy, you may only take an angry
red Onion; and having pilled and jagged it croſs-wiſe
with your knife, thruſt it into his Fundament,
uſing him in the ſame manner as before pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, if your Horſe's body be over-heated by
ſuperfluity of blood, then take a pint of ordinary
Honey, and boil it ſo thick as it is fit to be made
into Suppoſitories; this will ſo refrigerate and
cool his body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it will reduce it into an order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
temper.</p>

                  <p>Wherefore theſe premiſes conſidered, they are

                  <head>Wolfs teeth.</head>
                  <p>The Woolfs teeth are two extraordinary teeth,
being ſmall, and growing in the upper jaws, next
unto the great grinding teeth, which are ſo pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:44463:169"/>
and troubleſome to an Horſe that he cannot
indure to chaw his meat, but is forced either to
let it fall out of his mouth, or elſe to retain it in his
mouth half chewed.</p>
                  <p>The Cure is thus: firſt cauſe the Horſes head
to be tied up ſo high to ſome beam or rafter, and
his mouth opened with a cord ſo wide, that you
may with much eaſe ſee every part thereof, then
take an inſtrument made like a Carpenters Gouge,
and with your left hand ſet the edge of the tool at
the foot of the Wolfs teeth on the out ſide of the
jaw, turning the hollow ſide of the Tool down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
holding your hand ſteadily, ſo that the
tool may neither ſlip nor ſwerve from the Teeth
aforeſaid; then having a Mallet in your right
hand, ſtrike a ſtrong ſtroke upon the head of the
Tool, ſo that thereby you may looſen the Teeth,
and bend them inward, then ſtraining the midſt of
your Tool upon the Horſes neather jaw, wrinch
the Tooth outward, with the hollow ſide of the
ſaid Tool, and ſo thruſt it clean out of his head,
which done, ſerve the other Woolfs tooth on the
other ſide in like manner, and fill up the empty
holes with Salt finely brayed.</p>
                  <p>But this is a long tedious way, and I cannot
approve of it in my judgment to come near this
way I am going to preſcribe, which I have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
experimented; and that is, when you have
tied up your Horſes head, or if you pleaſe you may
caſt him, then open his mouth, and with a very
ſharp File, file the Woolfs teeth as ſmooth as is
poſſible, and then only waſh his mouth with a
little Allom water.</p>

                  <p>Take of living Toads five, the blackeſt and largeſt

done, lute up the pot ſo cloſe, that no air may enter.</p>
                  <p>Now take your pot, and carry it into ſome
void place, and there make a great fire round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it, and keep the fire about it till it be red
hot, continuing the fire about it after it is red
hot for near upon an hour, letting the fire to go
out of it ſelf, letting the pot to ſtand therein till it
be throughly cold; then take out what is contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
therein, and put it into a great Trough ſo pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
where no wind may come, covering the trough
with a Cloth; then ſtamp it well with a pound

a care of his eyes, and therefore a glaſs caſe would

                  <p>A Wen is an hard Excretion riſing out of the
fleſh, being ſomewhat firm externally, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally
towards the bottom there lodgeth pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trfection.</p>
                  <p>The Cauſes hereof are ſeveral, but the moſt
uſual are ſome hurt, ſtroke, bruiſe, blow, or
knock of a ſtone; there need no other ſigns than
the apparent ſwelling.</p>
                  <p>As to the Cure, if you can, tye a thread about
it, and that will eat it off; but if you cannot
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:44463:171"/>
come to tye any ſuch thing, then take your Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
knife and cut it a-croſs into four equal quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to the very bottom, but have a care you cut
neither Vein nor Sinew, then burn off the four
quarters with your Cauterizing Iron, then heal
the place with your afore preſcribed healing
Salve.</p>
                  <p>There are again Warts or Wens which grow
about the Saddle skirts, growing betwixt two
ribs, and do always proceed from old brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
                  <p>The uſual way of curing them is dayly to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint
them with Hogs greaſe for eight or nine
days, ſometimes bathing them with Wine Lees;
if they come to no head in that time then
launce them downward, and tent them with
Turpentine well waſhed, Yolks of Eggs, and
Saffron well incorporated together, renewing
the tent every day till the ſore be compleatly hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
                  <p>But if the Wart be Spongy, you muſt take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
courſe; but firſt let us look into the nature
hereof; a Malady muſt be firſt known what it
is, before you can apply a proper remedy.</p>
                  <p>A Spongy Wart then is a kind of Wen, which
ſometimes appeareth very big, at other times but
ſmall, but then they are in number many, grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in Cluſters.</p>
                  <p>They are occaſioned by very malignant blood,
ſuch as is very bad and rank. Where note that
my advice is never to breed of that Stallion or
Mare which is naturally inclined to them; for as
they themſelves will never be free from them,
though the utmoſt of Art is uſed to remove them,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:44463:172"/>
yet ſtill as they are diſplanted in one place they
will grow in another, ſo they will convey to their
breed what doth afflict them by the indiſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their own blood.</p>
                  <p>Now as to the Cure: firſt purge the Horſe
well; then take blood from the Maſter-vein,
which you find is the greateſt nouriſher of them;
if the Wart or Wen be a pretty diſtance from
the skin, then take two of the longeſt hairs
of his Tail, and tie about it as faſt as poſſibly
you may, ſo that they may not ſlip, in four or
five days they will eat the Wen quite off;
which done, take the powder of Verdigrieſe
and ſtrow upon the root of the Wen or Wart,
and that will abſolutely deſtroy the ſeed of its
further growth; then take the green Salve
afore ſpecified and heal the Sorrance; but if
you cannot come to tie it in the manner
aforeſaid, then burn it off and then take
away the Fire by Turpentine and Hogs-greaſe.</p>

                  <head>Wounds of all ſorts how cured whether new or old.</head>
                  <p>Before I give you the ſeveral remedies proper to
every wound, it will be very requiſite to give you
an exact account what wounds are in general, &amp;
they are, according to the opinion of the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert
and underſtanding Farriers, <hi>Solutio Continui,</hi>
or the Whole parted or divided. Now the Latins
make a difference between <hi>continuus</hi> and <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guus,</hi>
for continuity is the fleſh of either Lip,
contiguity is when both Lips are cloſed; again,
if there be no ſolution or diviſion, it is then ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
called a Contuſion than a Wound; a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſion
or bruiſe is made with a blunt weapon,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:44463:172"/>
Wounds with ſharp or piercing; yet if any part
of the whole be broken though with an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
that is blunt, it may properly go under
the denomination of a Wound.</p>
                  <p>Of Wounds ſome be hollow, others deep and
hollow; if a Wound happen in a fleſhy part,
ſo that no Sinew, Vein, Artery, Ligament, Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
or Nerve be lacerated, then it is called
a Simple wound, or if a bone be not fractured it
is the like; but if a bone be broke or a Vein, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> torn, as well as the whole divided,
then it is called a Compound Wound, which is
much more dangerous and difficult to cure than
the former.</p>
                  <p>If then an Horſe hath received a Wound in his
head, or in any other part of his body which is
full of Bones, Sinews, Griſtles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the opinion of the moſt judicious, waſh
the Wound well with white Wine vinegar warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and whilſt you are dreſſing the Wound, keep
it warm with clothes dipped in white Wine;
after this, take your Probe and ſearch the depth of
the Wound therewith, letting as little air as you
can to enter into the orifice thereof; having ſo
done, take of Turpentine, <hi>Mel Roſarum,</hi> Oil of
Roſes of each four ounces, with a little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrought
Wax, and having melted theſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
ſtir them well that they may be the better
incorporated; if it be a Cut only, make a round
Plegant of ſoft Towe, of that thickneſs and
length which may not only reach the bottom,
but fill up the Cavity: where note, make your
Plegant Taper-wiſe; for the bottom of the
Wound is not ſo wide as the mouth or top
thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="326" facs="tcp:44463:173"/>
If the Wound be long and large, then with a
ſtitching-quill and a needleful of fine Crimſon
ſilk, draw the lips thereof together, whereby the
Wound will not only heal ſooner, but will leave
a leſs ſcar or eye-ſore.</p>
                  <p>But if the hurt bear the reſemblance of a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
hole, then make a ſtiff Tent of lint, ſo long
as may reach the utmoſt extent of the Wound;
and this Tent you muſt dip in the foreſaid Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
before you put it in, then bolſter the ſame
with a little Lint or Towe: having ſo done, lay
over your Plegants and Tents a Plaiſter made of
Pitch, Rozin, Maſtich, Turpentine and Hogs-greaſe
of each as much as you think fit, ſpreading
it well on Leather and cover the Wound there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.</p>
                  <p>If it ſo happen that the mouth of the Wound
be not ſo wide that the internal corruption may
have a free paſſage, you may (if Sinews, Veins, or
Nerves do not obſtruct) lay it more open with
your Lancet or Inciſion-knife.</p>
                  <p>If the hole be deep and in ſuch a place that you
dare not cut it, then be ſure you make your
Tent full as big as the cavity is wide; let the
compoſition thereof be of a dry Sponge never
wet, though it may be ſomewhat difficult to get
the Tent down, yet by wrying it to and fro, it
will enter to the bottom at the laſt; thus dreſs
the Wound twice every day, mundifying the part
every time with white Wine luke-warm: now the
reaſon of uſing a dry Sponge for a Tent is this,
(it being firſt anointed with the aforeſaid Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
it will draw and ſuck up what ever filth
or corruption there is within, not leaving any
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:44463:173"/>
thing that is foul to annoy the part or obſtruct
the Cure; as you ſhall perceive it to heal, ſo leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
or contract your Tent, and leave not off tent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it as long as the Orifice will admit of one;
otherwiſe by haſty skinning of your wound, you
will make it turn into a Fiſtula.</p>
                  <p>If your Wound be green and but ſmall or very
inconſiderable, then take Soap and unſlaked Lime,
and work them into body, and having ſpread it
Plaiſter-wiſe, firſt waſh the green Wound with
white Wine warmed, then lay on the Plaiſter:
you may drie it up preſently with a Marrow-bone
burnt, and take the powder thereof and
ſtraw it on the Wound.</p>
                  <p>For any Wound whatſoever, old or new, this
green Ointment following will prove a ſpeedy
and infallible Cure.</p>
                  <p>Take of Water-betony, Comfry, Mugwort,
red Sage, Jeruſalem-ſage, Sothernwood, Rew
and of Roſemary of each two handfuls; boil
all theſe in a quart of May-butter, with the like
quantity of Mutton-ſuet; having boiled a while,
take it off and ſtrain it, and preſerve it for your
uſe; it will laſt a whole twelvemonth.</p>
                  <p>Now if the original of the Wound be ſome
old Impoſtumation, then your beſt way will be
to take three great Onions, and taking out the
Cores, put in the room of them ſome Bay-ſalt,
and a little Saffron, and ſo roaſt them in hot Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
and being hot lay them Plaiſter-wiſe to the
Wound, laying on freſh every day till you have
healed the Wound.</p>
                  <p>If you find there be too great a reſort and
conflux of humours to the Wound you would
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:44463:174"/>
heal with all convenient ſpeed; then take two
pints of Tartar, and put therein the quantity of
an Egg of Bole-armoniack, an handful of Bay-ſalt,
an handful of great Bur-dock-leaves or the
roots, waſh the ſwelled places round about every
day, and this will divert the humours and facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
the Cure.</p>
                  <p>This is another moſt excellent Defenſive,
which will repell thoſe humours that hinders the
healing of the Wound: Take a pint of Verjuice,
and infuſe therein three penniworth of Camphire
cut very ſmall; boil them together near half an
hour, (you may double or treble the quantity) and
when it is cold preſerve it for your uſe; waſh the
Wound with this daily.</p>
                  <p>If the upper skin of the wound be putrified,
and you would have it removed; then take a
Plaiſter of Cow-dung boiled in milk, and lay it
to the Wound, and in a day and a night it will
not leave any thing vile or ſuperfluous about the
Wound.</p>
                  <p>If an Horſe hath received a Wound about the
Belly, ſo that the fleſh is very much rent; then
take a pint of white Wine-vinegar, the ſharpeſt
that is to be gotten, and boil in it a quarter of a
pound of Bole-armoniack; having boiled a little
while, take it off, and then put therein a ſmall
quantity of freſh Butter and bathe the place
grieved once in two days.</p>
                  <p>If your Horſe be ſtaked, or wounded with a
Fork; firſt waſh the Wound very well with But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
melted and ſome Vinegar mixt therewith;
then take a Clout tied to a ſtick and dipt in Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed-oil
and run to the bottom of the Wound;
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:44463:174"/>
anoint it well, and in a little time this alone will
cure it: if perchance the wind ſhould get into it,
ſo as to make it ſwell, then anoint the ſwelling
with the Oil of Populeon.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, take ſome general Receipts for
the Cure of all ſorts of Wounds whatſoever, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the practice and experience of ancient
and modern Farriers.</p>
                  <p>For the Cure of any Wound whatſoever, take
four Ounces of Butter, Tar and black Soap of
each two ounces, with a little Turpentine; boil
all theſe together, excepting the Soap only,
which you muſt put in after the reſt are off the
fire; with this Ointment dreſs any Cut what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>

                  <head>Another.</head>

a Salve; but if the Horſe be ſtaked, as I
ſaid before, then caſt him, and pour into his
Wound Butter ſcalding hot, letting him lie ſo

Bladders being not always of one ſize, nor of

                  <p>In former times Farriers were wont to take
a Knife and open it to the length of a Bean,
piercing no further than through the skin, that
thereby they might thruſt out the Jelly, which
is like the White of an Egg, then take the Yolk
of an Egg and as much Oil de Bay as may equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize
a French Nut, and by mixing them make
a Plaiſter, and apply it to the Sore; the Cure
is effected in three or four days.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe in our later times take up the Maſter-vein,
on the inſide of his Legs, ſuffering him to
bleed only from below; then having put up the
Vein, cover all his Leg over with a Plaiſter of
Wine-lees and Wheat-flower mingled together,
and rowl it with a long Rowler, dreſſing him thus
once a day.</p>
                  <p>Others take the roots of Cummin, and beat
them well with Salt, and lay that to the Wind-gall.
Or take an ounce of white Wax, and the
like quantity of Rozin, two ounces of raw Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
three ounces of Swines-greaſe, two ounces
of the Oil of Yolks of Eggs, five ounces of Oil
de Bay; mix theſe together and ſtrain them,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:44463:176"/>
then rub herewith the Wind-gall, chafing it in,
and if you make it ſink in with an hot Iron it
will be the better, and will ſpeedily cure the
Wind-gall; this I have experienced, and find it
to be an excellent Remedy for a Wind-gall.</p>
                  <p>I will add but one more, and I have done,
which is this: with a fine Lancet open the Wind-gall,
not making the Orifice bigger than what
may be convenient to give paſſage to the white
Jelly therein contained; having thruſt it forth
ſo that none remain within, lap a wet woollen
cloth about the Sorrance, and with a Taylor's
Gooſe rub upon the cloth, till you have made it
ſuck in all the moiſture from the Wind-gall, ſo
that the Wind-gall be completely dry; then take
of Pitch, Rozin and Maſtich of each an equal
quantity, and being very hot daub it all over the
Wind-gall, clapping good ſtore of flox upon it
of the ſame colour the Horſe is of; then either
let him run to graſs or ſtay at home, it is indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
ſo that you let the Plaiſter ſtay on till it fall
off by its own accord, and the Cure will be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted.</p>
                  <p>By way of caution, take this for a ſafe Rule,
which if not obſerved will prove dangerous; uſe
neither Arſnick nor Reſalgar to a Wind-gall, for
if you do, the Wind-gall may diſappear for a
time, but it will return again, neither muſt you
burn much, and pray forbear to make any great
Inciſion, for any of theſe will ſo convert into
hardneſs the ſoft ſubſtance of the Wind-gall,
that the Horſe will become incurably lame.</p>

and being hot enough, it is my cuſtom to put

                  <p>Now the reaſon why I would have this white

upon a triple account; firſt to prevent giving
cold water to drink, which may prove danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous:

hapning to an Horſes back, but what I
ſhall now ſpeak of differs from them all; for
this weakneſs is a kind of biting or fretting of the
Reins, occaſioned by the conflux of many malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
humours flowing abundantly to that place,
depriving the hinder parts of the Horſe both of
feeling and ſtrength, in ſuch grievous manner,
that the Horſe cannot keep his feet, but will
immediately fall to the ground; when they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow
very much, they will make reſort to the

ſudden death, or at leaſt death in four hours

                  <p>The moſt approved Remedy that I can hear of

is, to take good ſtore of blood from the Neck-vein,

from the pitch of the Buttock unto an handful
within the Saddle, and then again overthwart,
and let every line be an inch one from the other,
but do not let the ſtrokes be deep, and no more
burnt than that each may look yellow; having
ſo done, cauſe him to ſwim in ſome deep pond or
river, then rowel him upon the Haunches, near
unto the Huckle-bones; after this anoint the

                  <p>An Horſe comes often to be troubled with the
Water-farcion by his mere feeding only, that is
to ſay, in low Marſhy watry grounds, and by his
grazing in places where the graſs grows but a
little above the ſurface of the water, whereby he
cannot but lick up the water as he feedeth, and
hence comes the ſwelling that is ſo often ſeen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
an Horſe's chaps and belly.</p>
                  <p>The Cure muſt be wrought thus: Take an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron
made into the faſhion of a Fleim, and heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it red hot, ſtrike through the skin and no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
upon the ſwelling, but no where elſe, and
let thoſe pricks be ſeveral; from each ſtroke or
prick you ſhall ſee iſſue a great quantity of yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
grey oily water: having let it run a while,
waſh it with Chamber-lye and Salt, as hot as
the Horſe can indure it; thus waſh the water Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
but four or five times and it will certainly
cure it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="335" facs="tcp:44463:177"/>
This waſhing ſerves for an ordinary ſwelling,
but if the ſwelling be very great, as it often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens,
then take ſtrong ſtale Urine, Salt and Bole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armoniack
the quantity of a large Nutmeg, and
having boiled them together waſh the Sorrance
therewith.</p>
                  <p>The Signs to know this Water-farcy from a
Pocky-farcy are theſe, the ſwelling will be in
great bags as big as a two-penny Loaf, ſometimes
under his belly, at other times under his jaws,
and about his chaps. Where note the more you
work any Horſe that is troubled with any ſort of
Farcy, the ſooner you ſhall complete the Cure, and
the Horſe will thrive the better.</p>
                  <p>And you need not to fear working your farcied
Horſe with another; but let them neither ſtand
nor feed together.</p>
                  <p>There is beſides this Water-farcy a Button-farcy,
and the ſigns to diſtinguiſh it from any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſort are bunches and knots, lying in burbles
in the skin, ſome as big as Cherry-ſtones, others
as big as Hazel-nuts.</p>
                  <p>The Cure muſt be effected after this manner;
firſt take good ſtore of blood from both ſides the
Horſes Neck; having ſo done, take ſome Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leek;
beat it and ſtrain it through a fine linnen
cloth, and the juice thereof convey into his ears;
then take an ounce of Ariſtolochia and beat it
ſmall or grate it, the tops of Rew one handful,
Hogs-greaſe the quantity of an Egg; beat theſe
three laſt into a Salve, and after the Houſleek di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
theſe into two equal proportions, put
the one part into one ear, and the other part into
the other ear; and having put ſome wool after
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:44463:178"/>
it to keep in the Medicine; ſtitch up the ears
with a needle; then with the point of
your Inciſion-knife make a ſmall hole in his
forehead, and then with your Cornet raiſe the
skin from his forehead the breadth of your hand
round about the hole; then take a red Dock-root
and ſlice it, and put three pieces thereof into the
hole, which will draw a great deal of putrefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from it, and that very putrefaction or corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
that comes from it will ſcald the hair away
where it runs; when the ſtrength of the root is
gone, it will drop out of it ſelf, and when it is
dropt out, anoint the place with freſh Butter, and
then clap thereon a Paiſter of Burgundy-pitch to
keep out the wind; let him, after this, ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the bit ſeven or eight hours, and then ſhall you
ſee him foam and champ as if he were ridden, let
what you put into his ears ſtay there eight and
forty hours; taking this courſe, the knobs or knots
will fall in a very little time, and the hair will
come again on the forehead.</p>

you firſt with good ſtore of cloathing keep the

ſo that it may not eaſily ſlip, then draw the reſt of
the cord between the girths and the Horſes body,
bringing it up juſt between the Horſes fore legs,
and as you ſit in the ſaddle hold the end of the

begin to grow reſtiff, then by pulling the cord,
cramp him by the Stones, and by that means

                  <p>If you find your Horſe of a dull ſloathful na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:44463:182"/>
or that he is wearied and tyred through tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
or ſome other means, then ſhave him on
both ſides, the breadth of the palm of your hand,
juſt upon the ſpurring places, then with a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet
make half a dozen ſmall Orifices on both ſides,
then raiſing the skin from the fleſh, put into each
hole ſome burnt Salt; this will make the ſore
rankle, and ſo let it remain three days, then mount
him and ſpur him well in the ſore places, after
this waſh the ſore with ſtale Urine, Salt, and
Nettles boiled together, this will cauſe the ſpur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
places to ſmart ſo grievouſly that he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

                  <p>To make the Sore whole take Honey, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint

                  <head>How to make Hair grow ſoon, thick and long.</head>
                  <p>To make hair grow long where it is ſhort,
thick where it is thin, or very ſoon in any bare
place, is an art that muſt not be ſlighted, ſince
the want of hair is a great deformity and eye-ſore
to any Horſe: to the intent you may ſupply ſuch
defects you muſt take this courſe: get the Urine
of a young Lad or Boy, and therewith firſt waſh
the bare place; after that take Lye made of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleckt
Lime, Ceruſs, and Litharge, and with it
waſh the aforeſaid place often, and it will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
procure Hair to grow, not only long but
thick.</p>
                  <p>This is an excellent way, but there are ſeveral
others not much inferiour to it, for variety ſake
I ſhall here inſert ſome of the beſt.</p>
                  <p>Take Agrimony pounded and infuſe it in
Goats milk, and therewith waſh that place
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:44463:182"/>
whereon you would have the Hair ſpeedily to
grow.</p>
                  <p>Or take the Dung of Goats, Allom, Honey,
and Swines blood, incorporate theſe well toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by ſtirring them over a fire, and when well
imbodyed, take thereof and anoint thee bare place
therewith.</p>
                  <p>Some take Nettle ſeed bruiſed, with Honey
and Salt mixt; others the root of a white Lilly
beaten, and boiled in Oil; others the juice of a
long Onion, or the juice of Radiſhes; others
Tar, Oil Olive and Honey boiled together; laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
others take the ſoot of a pot or kettle, and
mingling it with Oyl and Honey anoint the bare
place; but in my opinion, and according to my
long experience there is nothing more efficacious
for this purpoſe than to take green Wallnut ſhells
and burn them to powder, and mix the powder
with Honey, Oil, and Wine, and anointing the
place therewith, you will find an increaſe of
hair even to wonder.</p>

<pb n="347" facs="tcp:44463:183"/>
the Horſe hath any Glanders, or that he be
not troubled with a Curb, Splent or Spaven, and
by the waving of your hand to and fro before his
eyes you will ſoon diſcover any impediment in his
eyes.</p>
                  <p>The mark in his mouth will diſcover his age
if he be not above ſeven years old, but if that do
not viſibly appear, feel all down his Tail, if his
Strunt be ſmooth without any knobs at the end
you may adventure on him, having not ſeen half
his beſt days; but on the contrary, the knobs do
ſhow he hath not many good days to come.</p>
                  <p>Now if you would diſcover any ſecret malady
or imperfection lurking internally and not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable
by the eye, then let him run at the
halters length till he ſweat, and he will diſcover
an old cold by his cough, and by his drawing of
his breath, that he is either purſy or ſhort winded,
or if he be lame you will find where the grief li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

                  <p>Take ſpecial notice when you ride him whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he frequently turn up the white of his Eye,
or layeth his Ears to his pole; if he do, my life
for yours, he is a ſullen ill conditioned Jade, if
he be Wall-eyed he is ſo much the worſe: but if
when you come into the ſtable you perceive the
Horſe to ſtare nimbly about him ſometimes on
this ſide and ſometimes on that, and then again
quite behind, it argueth he is lively, full of met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
and hath a good ſtomach, then take him out

the ſeed injected by travel.</p>
                  <p>Be not over covetous of having too many colts

and let her not be covered till ſhe be about five
years old, and let it be before the full of the Moon,

Colt, if a female let the ſign be male, and after
the full.</p>
                  <p>To facilitate the conception ſet the Horſe with
the Mare two or three days by times, but ſuffer
them not to copulate, only do this to heighten
their deſire to each other; after this let him cover
her, and immediately after he hath withdrawn
himſelf from her, pour a pail of cold water on
the ridge of the Mares back, this will make her
knit the better, but ſuffer them not afterwards

The way to know whether your Mare be with

                  <p>If you would have your Colts be good Trot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
let your Stallion be of the Neapolitan breed
or a Barbary; as for Amblers, there is none better

               <div type="part">
                  <head>Rules and principles to be obſerved both in Colts
and Horſes very remarkable and worthy of due
conſideration.</head>
                  <p>Of all beaſts whatſoever the Legs of a Colt
grow leaſt; wherefore if his Legs be long, you
may conclude of the length and height of
his ſtature, and by the bigneſs of the Legs
his ſtrength and greatneſs is to be known:
Houſe not your Colts till they are three years
old.</p>
                  <p>When your Colt is fit to back, take notice if
he have a long back; if ſo, then fit him with a
large Saddle, and before you mount him make
him thoroughly acquainted with the Saddle,
putting it often on, and taking it as often off;
girt him by degrees, till you can make him en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
a ſtrait girting; let him ſmell to the Saddle,
and dangle the Stirrops, to make him the more
familiarly acquainted therewith.</p>
                  <p>Forget not to anoint your Bit, when you firſt
put it into your Horſes mouth with Honey and
the powder of Liquoriſh, or Honey and Salt
will do as well; but be ſure at no time that you
put any Bit or Snaffle into your Horſes mouth
without waſhing it.</p>
                  <p>Mount not your Horſes back before you have
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:44463:185"/>
the Bridle-reins faſt in your hand, and do not,
when you alight at the brow of an hill, drive
your Horſe before you, leſt you run the hazard of
loſing the reputation of a prudent Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
                  <p>If your Horſe be fiery and full of metal, do
not fret or be angry with him, but win him by
patience and fair means; but if you find him dull
and ſluggiſh quicken him with your Spur, with
this proviſo, that having ſpur'd him much, you
will, when you find conveniency, rub his Spur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galls
with water and ſalt.</p>
                  <p>Now as as to Horſes, ſeveral Countries pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
Horſes of different natures: as for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
as Mr. <hi>Markham</hi> obſerveth, the Greek or
Turkiſh Horſe is of an excellent conſtitution, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſwift, bold, well-headed, tall and ſtrong. The
Arabian Horſe is as ſwift as the wind and very
beautiful to the eye.</p>
                  <p>The African or Barbary is full of courage,
ſwift and nimble, and will not with the Turkey
Horſe either deſerve or endure much beating.
The Friezland Horſe is fiery, yet not well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditioned,
but as for your Flemiſh Horſe he is
the worſt of any. I cannot but approve of the
Spaniſh Jennet being very good, ſwift and light
of foot, but the Neapolitan for all uſes is moſt
excellent and beautiful; now for great bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
conſtant labour and long travel the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh
Horſe exceedeth all that have been named
hitherto.</p>
                  <p>Your Iriſh Horſe is generally well breaſted,
but I never ſaw any but what had thin and very
uncomely buttocks, being evil-natured, very ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:44463:185"/>
weak and unfit for much labour; thoſe that
are tolerably good are very ſcarce through the
whole Country.</p>

                  <head>The moſt experienced Horſemens obſervations.</head>
                  <p>Your Horſe being in health, feed him with ſuch
dry meats as ſhall not ſwell his body, as Straw,
which is excellent good to take up the belly of a
running Horſe, Hay, Oats, ſometimes a little
Wheat, Beans, Barley, bread made of Beans or
Peaſe, neither are Fitches to be deſpiſed, and
in the giving them obſerve this order; firſt give
him ſome hay, then water, and laſtly his grain or
provender.</p>
                  <p>When you are upon a journey, look firſt to
your Horſe before you look to your ſelf, ſeeing
that he be well rub'd down, well littered with
freſh ſtraw, and be ſure that you feed your Horſe
betimes, for all night, that it may the better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coct,
and that he may the ſooner take his reſt. I
would not adviſe you to give him of Provender
a greater quantity than three pints at a time;
there is nothing that feeds better and fattens more
ſpeedily than bread made either of Beans, Peaſe
or Fitches well cleanſed.</p>
                  <p>If you would have your Horſe to feed with an
extraordinary appetite, take Wine and Salt and
rub his mouth therewith.</p>
                  <p>In a journey, whether at baiting or at night,
coming to your Inn, let not your Horſe either eat
or drink whilſt he is hot, but firſt let him be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to his proper temperament.</p>
                  <p>In the extremity of heat and cold, the labour
of your Horſe muſt be always moderate.</p>
                  <p>Take not, after travel, the Saddle off your
Horſes back too ſuddenly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="352" facs="tcp:44463:186"/>
What-ever you do, let no Poultry come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
your Stable; for ſhould your Horſe lick up a
feather, or ſwallow any of their dung, which ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually
fell into the Hay or Provender, it is of a
dangerous conſequence.</p>
                  <p>Make it frequently your buſineſs to ride your
Horſe on ſtony ground, for by ſo doing you
will reap the benefit of hardening his Hoofs,
which will the better enable him to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel.</p>
                  <p>Have a care of letting your Horſe ſtand near
any Mud-wall, for I have known Horſes, not a
few, which have coveted to eat thereof to their
very great prejudice; and let his bed be made
not of Barley-ſtraw, for ſome Horſes love to eat
thereof, which is unwholſome; but let it be of
Wheat, or rather of Oaten Straw; for that is ſoft,
and if eaten very wholſom.</p>
                  <p>It is the opinion of all, that to ſprinkle water
upon the Hay you give your Horſe is wholſom,
and moſt ſovereign to mingle Fenugreek with his
Provender, the firſt is good for the wind and the
latter for the worms.</p>
                  <p>If your Horſe happen to be brought very
low and much impoveriſhed by too much labour
or ſome great ſurfeit, get Mares-milk and give
it him eight days together, and you will perceive
a very ſenſible recovery.</p>
                  <p>The beſt hours for watering are between ſeven
and eight in the morning, and four and five in
the evening.</p>
                  <p>You are to take notice, that an Horſe takes much
delight in rubbing and combing, and therein he
ſeems to be ſenſible what is good for himſelf;
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:44463:186"/>
for it preſerves his health, and keeps the ſtrength
of body and legs.</p>
                  <p>In the Canicular or Dog-days, you muſt have
a ſpecial care that you do not ride your Horſe
frequently into the water to qualifie or allay his
natural or any other contracted heat.</p>
                  <p>Be mindful of often picking and cleanſing the
bottoms of your Horſes feet, and ſtuff them well
with Oxe or Cow-dung, and now and then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oint
his hoofs with freſh Greaſe and Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine.</p>
                  <p>When you ride, forget not to look often to
your Saddle, and ſee that it wring or pinch him
not, and that his ſhooes be faſt on, and that
there be no Gravel, Stub or Nail got into his
foot.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, according to Northern obſervation,
uſe no other walking than your ſelf upon your
Horſes back, that is to ſay, you muſt ride him
gently to his Inn, ſo cooling him by degrees;
when in the Stable, ſhake Litter under him, and
ſee that every part of his body be rubbed, till it
be drie, not omitting his head; then unbridle
him, and give him Hay, but ſlack no girt in two or
three hours, and when he drinks, let it be but little
for fear of too haſty cooling his Stomach.</p>

love for their Horſes, that their inclinations
lead them to ride before they can well go: this
makes them generally more knowing in Horſes

dare not juſtifie the truth hereof, but this I may,
That many of them will not long be without an
Horſe if they have but money enough to purchaſe
a Bridle; as for a Saddle, they can make that
themſelves, ſo little (and yet ſo commodious)
that they can carry it in their breeches without
diſcovery.</p>
                  <p>Further, to prove them Horſemen even from
their Cradles; look into the Inns, eſpecially of

will dance and caper when ever he ſeeth
his Maſter come into the Stable; but the cunning
Jockey will never uſe his whip or rod when he
brings any Cuſtomer to look upon him, that he
may infuſe a belief that this prancing is the effect
of his great mettle, and not of the fear of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>Beſides; that he may thus caper when he is
ridd in <hi>Smithfield,</hi> the Boy that rides him (as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
they make uſe of ſuch Cattle for their
purpoſe) hath frequently a fling at him before he
is put to ſale; this makes the poor beaſtfling and
flounce, when the Boy mounts him, as being
too ſenſible of what puniſhment he is to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo.</p>
                  <p>Thus many men are abuſed; for though the
Horſe thus prance the length of <hi>Smithfield,</hi> the
Buyer will find him in half a ſcore miles riding
that he will not ſtir one foot further.</p>

take of Elicampane, of Cummin-ſeeds, of Turme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,

uſed ſeveral projects, but none would take; as
firſt, he would often cheapen his own Horſe, and
often bid within ten ſhillings of the price he was
profer'd for, which the Rider was by agreement
to refuſe, to make others the more eager to buy
him: when that would not do, he got ſome
friends to cheapen his Horſe by turns, and yet
this procured never a Chapman; having tried ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
other ways, at length he pitch'd on this:
he ſets up his Horſe till friday the next Market-day
for <hi>Smithfield;</hi> the day being come, he got
up before Sun-riſing, and having gotten a couple
of his Confederates mounted as he was, as ſoon
as the Sun appeared, (which was in the midſt of
Summer) he rode from the Sun in <hi>Charterhouſe-lane</hi>
to the Sun in <hi>Alderſgate-ſtreet,</hi> and from
thence to the Bell-Inn, and there reſted till the
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:44463:190"/>
Sun was gone down, and then rides him through
<hi>Smithfield</hi> (having ſomewhat heated him, to
make him look ſomewhat like a Traveller) a
Gentleman ſeeing the Horſe, calls the Rider, and
demands the price of his Horſe; truly Sir, ſaid
he, I am very loth to ſell my Horſe, but were I
minded ſo to do, this is no proper time; for I
proteſt, ſaid the Jockey, I have rid him this
very day from Sun to Sun and never drew
bit, my occaſions being very urgent; and if
you will not believe it, there are now two Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
(meaning his own Comerades) at the Bell-Inn
in <hi>Alderſgate</hi> will juſtifie it, this made the
Gentleman ſo eager (finding the price much low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than he imagined, and the Horſe ſo well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſo long travel and hunger) that he bought
him; but in ſix days after he could not ride him
the length of <hi>Long-lane.</hi>
