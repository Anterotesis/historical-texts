            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I learned out of your Graces wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.
And well might this be to mee
the first newes. For, if I mistake
not, you were the first Writer, that published those
trickes in print to the World: though (as begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
vse to be) that discouery of this Art was but
briefe in comparison, either because that occasion
did not admit of any long or full discourse, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
but little of this mystery could then at the
first be discouered; the professors of that Trade, as
your selfe also signifie, labouring to hide their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
from the knowledge of other men. And indeed
it may be obserued, that in managing of the Papacy,
they haue certaine <hi>mysteries</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> which the
<pb facs="tcp:12745:3"/>
more they vse, the more they coceale. One of which,
is their power to murder Kings, and blow vp Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,
&amp; kill all that stand in their way, like the
<hi>Assassini,</hi> who held it a point of great merit to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
all that were their aduersaries in Religion: but
yet they are not willing that the world should know
that this is any part of their <hi>Creede.</hi> Another such
policy may be that of their <hi>Indices Expurgatorij,</hi>
by which they haue circucised the lips of such Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
as spoke any word against the Roman Church:
but this they kept as a great <hi>mystery</hi> among some
few of themselues, till misfortune brought it to
light, full sore against their wils. And for a third
such-like policy, I may reckon also this Art of Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiocation,
which the Masters thereof did keepe se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
as long, and as much as they could. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was no maruell, if your first discouery of
this <hi>mystery</hi> were but briefe in comparison. But

lighting vpon a more compleate Treatise then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly

<pb facs="tcp:12745:3"/>
hunted him into the open field, there to display
himselfe, and to shew what trickes he could vse, for
sauing his new Art from the infamy of lying. And
here I finding him well chafed, did by the sent fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
after him vnto his Den, to espie if I might, what
he and his Cubs were deuising in the darke. And I
found them very busie in hammering <hi>Reseruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
and <hi>mentall</hi> frauds, vpon euery occasion and
in all kindes of dealing, thereby to catch vs at vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares,
who being plain and simple men our selues,
could not suspect such frauds and impostures in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
And in case these things should come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
as in part themselues had discouered them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
their wils: yet so confident and resolute did
I finde them, to maintaine all for good and honest
dealing, as that Father<note n="a" place="margin">Mitigat. cap. 9. nu. 81. p. 403.</note> 
               <hi>Persons</hi> maketh a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

with men then hee had done with beasts, if hee
should not grant them <hi>equiuocating</hi> trickes, and
<hi>reserued</hi> wiles, as he hath granted to <hi>the Hare
and the Foxe, their leapes and turnings, and
windings, and going backe againe in the same
trace they come, to deceiue the Dogges</hi> that
pursue them. And yet all this confidence I take to
be but a copie of their countenance. For euen in
their printed Apologies of this Arte, they seeke to
<pb facs="tcp:12745:4"/>
cast mists before the Readers eyes, that hee may
not be able to see the depth of their meaning. These
things when I had found, as I thought, (though I
know I am much short of finding all) I was willing,
according to my abilitie, to impart them vnto well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning
Christians, that they seeing the deepe
frauds of these men, may learne to shun their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany

Dearely beloued Parishioners, the

IESVS CHRIST.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the ordinary exercise of my
ministery among you, when I
came to speak of the ninth Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,
the first thing that
I met with to bee considered,
was the matter of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Lying.</hi> And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
hereof, I found two sorts of Lyes
frequent among men: the one, an open and
professed Lye; and the other, a cunning and
artificiall Lye. The former was defended by
the <hi>Priscillianists,</hi> an old kinde of Heretikes: &amp;
the latter is now defended by the <hi>Romanists,</hi>
a latter sort of false Prophets. Both of them are
odious to God, who is honoured by <hi>Truth;</hi>
and pernicious to the societie of men, which
is vpheld by <hi>Truth:</hi> but the latter is the more
<pb facs="tcp:12745:5"/>
dangerous, because vnder a colour of <hi>Truth</hi> it
beguileth simple soules, who are otherwise e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
to Lying. The consideration heereof,
made me to enquire a little further into this
Arte; which the fauourers therof haue sought
to conceile, by calling it by a new name. For
beeing ashamed of the name of Lying, they
haue christened it by the name of Equiuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting:
a name as vnknowne in this meaning,
as the Arte it selfe was vnheard of before these
latter dayes. The mystery and iuggling tricks
of which deuice, I did then and vpon that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
in part discouer vnto you: but briefely
and plainely, the time, and place, and occasion
not admitting of any long or Schoole-like
discourse. But since considering, that together
with the increase of false Prophets in this
Kingdome, this Arte of falsehood hath aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
also: I thought it a part of my duty, (God
hauing pleased to place mee as a Watch-man
ouer your Soules) to giue you a fresh warning
of this danger, and that in a more ample and
large discourse, then formerly I had done, and
in such a maner and sort, that you might haue
something lying by you, that might aduertise
you of this dangerous deceit, when I could
<pb facs="tcp:12745:5"/>
not haue opportunity to speak vnto you our of
the Pulpit. And this I was moued to vnat this
time the rather; because I haue of late obserued,
that these artificiall Lyers (among their other
deuices and forgeries, which vpon confidence
of this Arte, they take liberty to vse without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse)
doe instill into the minds of their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous
followers, an opinion; and doe labour
to spread abroad among others a suspition,
that among our Learned men, many in heart
are of their Church, howsoeuer for the worlds
sake they dissemble their opinion: and that
there are a good number among vs of the
Clergie, who are better perswaded of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
then of our own. Doctor <hi>Sheldon,</hi> a man
well acquainted with their dealings, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

               <hi>whilest hee fed on Romes huskes, hee
often heard of many grieuous imputations laied
vpon some of the greatest Clerkes in the Church
of England, as though in heart they were theirs,
which he then beleeued</hi> to be true, as others did;
<hi>but since hath found to be</hi> much otherwise. And
my selfe haue met with some, (which perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
me, that they abuse others in this kind,
<pb facs="tcp:12745:6"/>
beside our <hi>greatest Clerkes)</hi> who haue more
then intimated to my selfe, that I knew that
which might iustifie their cause, if I would
speake it. Which might well put mee into a
muse, what had euer slipped fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me, why they
should be perswaded that I had such an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

that this might well be one of the Iesuires e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiuocating

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
vs, into their Disciples minds, that so
they might gaine more credit to their cause.

some such as well as they) they set vpon such
weaklings, with plausible tales in commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of their Church; whose open abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
practised at home among themselues,
are not so well known to vs, who haue neuer
trauelled into Popish Countreys. And if by
<pb facs="tcp:12745:6"/>
this meanes they chance to peruert a <hi>weake</hi> and
<hi>vnsettled</hi> man, then the cry goeth, that such a
<hi>Learned</hi> man, is become a Catholike, because
euidence of truth forced him to forkake his
old Profession.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if they meete with men, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
either opinatiue of their own worth, think
their good parts not sufficiently rewarded; or
being indeed of good parts, haue but slender
meanes: they tempt such, as the Deuill did
our Sauiour, with offers of gifts and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
And if by these allurements they can
bribe any man to become their <hi>Proselyte,</hi> for
<hi>filthy lucre sake,</hi> then they blaze abroad the
conuersion of such a great and learned Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
who could not withstand the light of truth
shining in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, if by these, and such like policies,
they preuaile not: (for these deuices fit them
best, because then they bring men ouer to their
side, with their own mouthes to publish their
owne shame; but if thus they preuaile not) yet
one shift they haue behind, which is, to deuise
lyes, of such and such mens conuersion to
their Church, who euer hated it from their
very soules. In which kind of forgerie, they
<pb facs="tcp:12745:7"/>
haue so farre proceeded, that they haue spared
neither liuing nor dead. For, as if they had cast
off all feare of shame, which was sure in the
end to be their reward, they haue in writing
belyed in this maner, the chiefest Doctors in
our Church, who haue suruiued to refute, and
to detest their forgeries in Print. But when
men are dead, then they become more bold:
and of the most constant and zealous Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
of our Religion, they giue it out to the
world, that such and such men of chiefe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme
in the <hi>Protestant</hi> Church, did recant v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
their death beds, it being then no time to
dissemble any longer. And when themselues
haue first deuised these tales on their fingers
ends; then they produce them in their serious
bookes of Controuersie, as graue argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts to
confirme the <hi>Roman</hi> faith by. The discouery of
which falsehood, I wish it may worke the like
effect in your hearts, that it hath done in mine:
which is, that whereas I vtterly disliked Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
before, I do now detest it more then euer.
And for this purpose I was the rather moued
to penne this small Treatise, that you, of
whose soules I knowe my selfe to haue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
the charge, seeing these forgeries,
<pb facs="tcp:12745:7"/>
may learne to beware of <hi>Equiuocating Spirits:</hi>
who, though otherwise they professe strictnes
of conscience, &amp; according to the rules of the
<hi>Romane</hi> Faith, are very deuout and religious;
yet can cozen you with an hundred lying de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices,
and neuer feele the least grudge of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
for it. For so Father <hi>Persons</hi> telleth vs,
that<note n="*" place="margin">Apologie of Eccles. Subordinat. cap. 12. in the very end.</note> 
               <hi>Equiuocations are allowed principally to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
of scrupulous conscience, for auoiding of lying.</hi> By
which he giueth vs a faire warning, (and I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
you take notice of it) that if there be any
scrupulous and tender consciences amongst
them (as some no doubt there are) though
they would not tell a lye, if they knew it, for
all the world, yet euen such men may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any scruple or feare, deceiue vs with <hi>equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocating
reseruations,</hi> and mentall deuices. And
hauing thus giuen you this faire warning, now
me thinketh I may speake vnto you, to the
same purpose as our Lord did to his Disciples;<note place="margin">Matt. 24. 5, 23, 24.</note>

so that I may rather take vp that saying
of the Apostle, <hi>I haue confidence in you through
the Lord, that ye will be no otherwise minded; but
that,</hi> if any man shall <hi>trouble you,</hi> (or seeke to
withdrawe you from your faith) <hi>he shall beare
his iudgement, whosoeuer he be.</hi> And in assurance
hereof,<note place="margin">Gal. 6. 18.</note> I leaue you to Gods grace, in the words

among men. The first is a <hi>proper</hi> and
<hi>ancient</hi> vse of it, frequent among all sorts
of writers, but handled and spoken of, especially in Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke.
The second is an <hi>improper</hi> and <hi>abusiue</hi> acception
of it, which was of late yeeres deuised by some wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and Doctors of the Romane Church. Father <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>

(especially seeing the one of them is a man so well

of <hi>Equiuocation)</hi> I presume I haue sufficient war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
to say as I did, without the controll of any of our
punie Iesuites, that the one vse and acception is <hi>proper</hi>
and <hi>ancient,</hi> the other <hi>vnproper,</hi> and of a later growth,
that is, since the <hi>mystery of iniquity</hi> did open it selfe
more fully to the world, and men did more apparantly
<hi>speake lies in hypocrisie.</hi> But yet for the distinguishing of
these two kindes, I will rather call the first <hi>Logicall E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiuocation,</hi>
as being that which Logicke doth onely
acknowledge: and the later I will call <hi>Iesuiticall Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation,</hi>
as hauing, if not its first deuising, yet at least, its
polishing from men of that Order. The Question in
this place is onely concerning the later, which I call
<hi>Iesuiticall Equiuocation.</hi> Notwithstanding for the better
clearing of the point in controuersie, somewhat is first
to bee said concerning the former, which I call <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

                  </gap> senses then one, <hi>and it hapeneth three wayes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. When a word by it selfe hath diuers significations
and meanings; as this word <hi>[to know]</hi> hath. For some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
it signifieth to apprehend and vnderstand the
certainety of some truth:<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. Ioh. 3. 20.</note> as when S. <hi>Iohn</hi> saith; GOD
<hi>is greater then our hearts, and knoweth all things. 2. [To
know]</hi> is as much as to approue and allow of: as when
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:12745:14"/>
                  <hi>Dauid</hi> saith;<note place="margin">Psal. 1. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>The Lord knoweth the way of the righteous.</hi>
And when Christ saith to the foolish Virgins;<note place="margin">Math. 25. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>Verily
I say vnto you, I know you not.</hi> The meaning is; I doe not
acknowledge you for any of mine. In this, and such like
words as this, there is an <hi>Equiuocation;</hi> because the
word hath diuers acceptions and vses.</p>
               <p>2. When words, which haue but one signification
of themselues, yet are so ioyned together in some sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
as that they may, by reason of the composition,
make and yeeld diuers meanings: or when by reason
of their contexture, they may haue moe meanings than
one:<note place="margin">Acts 19. 5.</note> as when S. <hi>Luke</hi> saith; <hi>When they heard this, they
were baptized in the Name of the Lord Iesus:</hi> these
words are diuersly construed by the Learned. For
some thinke them to bee the words of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and
to haue reference to the speech of <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
going before: and then the meaning must bee
this; that when those brethren, there spoken of, <hi>heard
Iohn</hi> so teaching concerning Christ, <hi>they were baptized</hi>
of <hi>Iohn, in the Name of the Lord Iesus.</hi> But others thinke
them to be the words of S. <hi>Luke,</hi> and to haue reference
to the former speech of S. <hi>Paul:</hi> and then the meaning
must be; that when those brethren had <hi>heard Paul</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing
in this manner of <hi>Iohn</hi> and his Baptisme, then
<hi>They were baptized</hi> of <hi>Paul, in the Name of Christ.</hi> In
this Clause then, there are two senses giuen by the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
and that sheweth that there is an ambiguity; but
that ambiguitie riseth not from the diuersitie of signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
in any of the words, but from the different con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of the contexture or composition of the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</p>
               <p>3. When the circumstances of time, place, persons,
&amp;c. are such, as that in reason, and in the iudgement of
sober men, being well and duely considered, they may
limit or restraine the speech to some speciall matter or
subiect; or otherwise alter the meaning of it from that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:12745:15"/>
which it should haue, if it were in some other place, and
vpon some other occasion. As for example: when S.
<hi>Paul</hi> saith; <hi>I haue not shunned to declare vnto you all the
Counsell of God.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 20. 27.</note> These words considered by themselues,
doe comprize all the Secrets of God, and all the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of His Wisedome: but if we consider the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of the persons, time, place, and occasion; as that
the speaker was <hi>Paul,</hi> an Apostle, whose office and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
was to teach the mysteries of Religion; that
the hearers were the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> who expected
information in matters of saluation; and that the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of their meeting at this time, and in this place,
was onely for teaching and learning the Word of God,
and the Gospell of Iesus Christ: these circumstances, in
reason, may teach vs, that in this place, those words
<hi>[all the Counsell of God]</hi> are not to bee extended to all
the secrets and depth of Gods Wisedome; a great part
whereof, is neither reuealed, nor necessarie to bee
knowne of any man; and some part whereof, though it
be reuealed, yet was not pertinent to this occasion; but
rather, that those words are to bee limited and restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
according to the present occasion, to signifie and
note, all necessary things for them to know for their
soules health and saluation. Or, to giue a more famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar
example, and such as a Iesuite hath giuen instance in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
wee may suppose, that two men going together in a
iourney; the one of them (his money sayling him) desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
to borrow ten pound of his fellow; who maketh
answere, that he hath not so much: heere his meaning
must be supposed to be, that he hath not so much in his
purse, or so much in a readinesse about him, though he
had foure times the like value in his Chest at home.
But if the same thing should be desired of him, when he
were at home in his owne house, then the meaning
would be, that he had not such a summe at home. And
the same answere, which was true, beeing giuen to his
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:12745:15"/>
fellow. Traueller by the way; would be a lye, if it were
vttered to him in his house. Thus there may arise an
ambiguity in a speech, by reason of the circumstances
of person, place, time, and occasion; where otherwise
there is no ambiguity either in the signification of any
word, or in the composition of the sentence, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in and by themselues.</p>
               <p>And in what kind soeuer, of these now specified, there
happeneth an ambiguity; that I call a <hi>Logicall Equiuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;</hi>
concerning which our present question is not.
For as the Doctors of the Romane Church, so the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
of our side doe acknowledge, that there may bee a
lawfull vse of equiuocall speeches in euery of these
kinds, if they be not extended too farre, or mis-applyed
to a wrong cause. For, to speake more particularly, it
is granted.</p>
               <p>1. That we may lawfully vse words, which may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently
be taken in diuers acceptions and meanings,
as they are then vsed. And this is plaine, partly because
the Scriptures are full of such speeches; and partly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
our common conuersation and life cannot bee
without them.</p>
               <p>2. It is not vnlawfull, when some case of further
good doth require it, to vse these ambiguous speeches
in the lesse knowne and common signification, and in
a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>other meaning then it is likely the hearers wil vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
them for the present. For so, when our Lord said,
<hi>Lazarus our friend sleepeth:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 11. 11.</note> He meant that he was dead,
which was the lesse common and knowne signification;
and therefore the Disciples, according to the more v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall
meaning, vnderstood him of naturall sleepe. And
he did this for good purpose, and for the profit of the
hearers; that they might heereby learne, either that
death in generall is to Gods children but as a <hi>sleepe,</hi>
by which they are refreshed, and made the more liuely:
or that this death of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> was rather to bee called
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:12745:16"/>
asleepe, then a death, because hee was so speedily rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
from it againe.</p>
               <p>3 It is not vnlawfull, if there be iust cause for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing
of a trueth, to vse an ambiguous speach in any
of these kindes, that thereby we may hide some thing
from the hearers, which they should not know. This
assertion hath not so direct proofe from <hi>Scripture,</hi> as
the others haue; &amp; yet it is not without all proofe from
the <hi>Scriptures</hi> neither. For there wee finde, that a man
may lawfully vtter one trueth, thereby to hide another
trueth from the hearer. As for example,<note n="a" place="margin">1. Sam. 16. 1, 2.</note> God appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Samuel</hi> to goe to <hi>Bethleem</hi> and anoint one of <hi>Iesses</hi>
sonnes to bee King; and when <hi>Samuel</hi> obiected, <hi>How
can I goe? If</hi> Saul <hi>heare it, hee will kill mee. The Lord
said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am come to sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to the Lord.</hi> And so <hi>Samuel</hi> did, as it followeth in
the same Chapter; and by this he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cealed his purpose
of anointing a new King; which was the speciall intent
of his going to that place. And if it be lawfull and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted
by Gods own appointment to vtter one trueth,
for the concealing of another: then in reason I thinke it
cannot iustly be condemned for vnlawfull, if a man, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
iust occasion, doe vse an ambiguous speech in a true
sense, thereby to hide from the hearer, something which
hee should not knowe. For if in so doing any thing bee
faulty, it must be, as I take it, the one of the two; either
because an ambiguous speach is vsed in another mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
then it is likely the hearer will take it; and that
to be lawfull, is prooued in the former assertion: or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
this true sense in the ambiguous speach, is vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to conceale another thing from the hearer; and that
to be lawfull, is cleare by this example of <hi>Samuel.</hi> And
therfore I thinke the conclusion may hence be inferred,
that it is not vnlawfull, if there be iust cause for concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of a trueth, to vse an ambiguous speach, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we may conceale some other thing, which is not fit
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:12745:16"/>
to be vttered. And hereto agree our learned diuines al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so

This is the opinion and iudgement of our learned men,
concerning the vse of <hi>Logicall Equiuocation;</hi> and herein
we agree with them of the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> or if there
bee any difference among the learned of both sides in
these cases already mentioned, as perhaps about some
circumstances in the vse of those ambiguous speaches
there may be, it is nothing to the present Question in
hand, which is not concerning any of the kindes of
these <hi>Logicall Equiuocations,</hi> which consist in the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous
acception and meaning of the words vttered.
And therefore when the <hi>Equiuocaters</hi> of our time doe
labor to confirme their <hi>Arte,</hi> by the authorized vse of
such speaches, as are ambiguous by reason of the diuers
meanings which the words may receiue, they misse the
marke, beate the ayre, and spend their labour to no
purpose.</p>
               <p>And this being briefly noted, concerning the true
and <hi>Logicall Equiuocation,</hi> I come now to the <hi>improper</hi>
and <hi>Iesuiticall.</hi> And that what it is, I will set downe in
their owne words, who professe to bee Patrons of it.

               <p>l. That this <hi>mixt Proposition</hi> of theirs, or this <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation,</hi>
as they call it, whether we consider that part
of it which is vttered in words; or the whole Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

and true, &amp;c.</hi> Out of which words, considered &amp; ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with that which was formerly cited out of <hi>Sanchez</hi>
and <hi>Parsons,</hi> we may note three things. 1. That there
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:12745:18"/>
is no <hi>ambiguity</hi> or <hi>doubtfull sense,</hi> either in the words
vttered, if they be taken alone; nor in the whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
as they compound it of the words vttered, &amp;
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he reseruation vnderstood, taken together. 2. That
therefore they call it <hi>Equiuocation,</hi> or an <hi>Equiuocall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position</hi>
or speech; because they signifie or expresse one
meaning to the hearer, which is false; and retaine or
vnderstand another sense within themselues, which is
true. 3. That the taking of this word <hi>Equiuocation</hi> in
this meaning, is not proper, and such as <hi>Aristotle</hi> did
vnderstand and conceiue by it. Hee might haue said,
that it is not proper, nor such as either <hi>Aristotle,</hi> or
any man either learned or vnlearned, hauing but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
sense in his head, and common honesty in his
heart, did euer acknowledge before this last Age. And
the truth is, they therfore call it an <hi>Equiuocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> though
the word was neuer known to haue any such meaning
or signification<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because they are ashamed to call it by
its right name, which is, <hi>A Lye.</hi> But as the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
man, though he practiseth the thing, yet abhorres
the name; and therefore will be called <hi>a good husband,</hi>
or <hi>a thrifty man:</hi> And as a thiefe is ashamed of his right
name, and when he meeteth with a Traueller to whom
he would signifie his e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rand; he saith, that <hi>he is a Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellow
which wanteth money:</hi> So the <hi>Romanists</hi> teach an
Arte of lying; and because they are ashamed of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous
name of <hi>Lyers,</hi> they call themselues <hi>Equiuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cators:</hi>
and that which other men call <hi>Lying,</hi> they call
<hi>Equiuocating.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. That if a man will vse this benefit of <hi>Equiuocating,</hi>
he must be warie and carefull, that he reserue some se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
clause in his mind, which being added to the words
vttered, doe make a true speech; or else all is marred,
and he, for want of that clause, become a plaine Lyer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To this purpose, Father</hi> Persons<note n="a" place="margin">Mitig. cap. 10. nu. 22. pag. 424</note> 
                  <hi>saith, that the</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiuocator
speaketh a trueth in his owne meaning, and in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:12745:18"/>
the sight ef God; which alwaies he must doe, when hee v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
this Euasion; for that otherwise he should lye, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
sinne, if he had not some true sense reserued in his mind,
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>To declare this yet further: Say that two Priests
were questioned by a Magistrate, whether they were
Priests or no; and the one should say, <hi>I am no Priest:</hi>
and should withall reserue in his mind this clause, <hi>So
as I am bound to tell you:</hi> and the other should answere
in the very same words, <hi>I am no Priest:</hi> but should for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
or neglect to frame or imagine in his mind that <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation,</hi>
or some such like: the former, who imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
that reseruation in his mind, should be an <hi>Equiuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Risum teneatis, amici?</note>
and speake the truth; but the latter, who had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
it, should be a <hi>Lyer,</hi> and vtter a falshood and
vntruth, though hee speake none but the very same
words; and they haue none but one signification and
meaning.</p>
               <p>This they say, to shew vs, how an <hi>Equiuocator</hi> doth
differ very much from a <hi>Lyer.</hi> The truth is; this <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocator</hi>
and this <hi>Lyer</hi> doe differ as much as two false
knaues, the one of which is called a Thiefe, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>a Good-fellow that taketh a Purse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. That whatsoeuer a man doe say or sweare, be it
otherwise neuer so false and absurd; yet if a man doe i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine
a clause in his mind, which being added to the
words spoken, would make a true meaning; then the
former speech or saying, how false soeuer otherwise be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth
true, and without all compasse of lying: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
(saith Father<note n="a" place="margin">Mitigat. cap. 10. nu. 14. pag. 418.</note> 
                  <hi>Persons) it is freed from the nature
of a Lye, by the due &amp; iust reseruation in the speakers mind.
By the due and iust reseruation,</hi> saith hee. But suppose
the <hi>reseruation</hi> be not <hi>iust</hi> and <hi>due,</hi> but that a man vse
this arte, when he ought not to <hi>equiuocate?</hi> Why, yet
euen then, he is by this reseruation freed from telling of

mocke his Reader; making shew of following the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

he hath no such meaning as they had in them. For,
when he speaketh plainely, and so as you may vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
his distinct meaning. them his<note n="a" place="margin">Mitig. cap. 8. nu. 55. p. 344.</note> words are; <hi>I doe
truely and really meane, that I am no Priest, in the sense
that I speake it, which may be any that pleaseth me, or that
I list to frame to my selfe: so as I may meane, that I am no
Priest, such as I should be, such as I desire to be, such as is
worthy of so great an office, and sacred a function; such as
he ought to be, that occupieth the place of God in gouerning
of soules; I am no Priest subiect to the demander, or obliged
to answere his demands; or the like.</hi> Thus, and such like,
whatsoeuer he pleaseth, he professeth may be his <hi>reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uations,</hi>

better, doe they allow and practise in the Arte of Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocating,
whereof there is frequent mention in their
Bookes and Treatises of this argument. By all which it
appeareth, that they approoue of any <hi>reseruatirn,</hi> which
a man can fancie, if the case be such as they allow of, and
the clause such, as may signifie a trueth.</p>
               <p>5. That this <hi>Equiuocation</hi> of theirs, is lawfull, not
onely in ordinary speach, but in oathes also. This is
plainely auouched by Father <hi>Persons,</hi> and vpon this
reason,<note n="a" place="margin">Mitigat. ca. 11. nu. 17. pag. 449.</note> 
                  <hi>Because it is a most certaine principle, as well in
reason, as in Diuinitie, that what a man may truely say, hee
may truely also sweare.</hi> And againe,<note n="b" place="margin">Mitig. c. 11. nu. 43. pa. 468.</note> 
                  <hi>As all Diuines
held</hi> (saith hee) <hi>that which may lawfully be said, may also
lawfully be sworne.</hi> And to this doe agree others of this
Crue, who commonly handle this question of <hi>Equiuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi>
in their Treatises of Oathes, and allow it as a
thing very lawfull, and of good vse.</p>
               <p>6. That this Arte was deuised, and so by them is
vsed, that by it they may deceiue the vnderstanding of
the hearer, and make him beleeue an vntrueth, when it
may serue for their turne. To this purpose those words
of Father <hi>Persons</hi> sound,<note n="c" place="margin">Mitig. c. 7. nu. 14. pag. 284</note> 
                  <hi>Equiuocation must sometime
be practised, when no other euasion can be found for defence
of innocencie, iustice, secrecy, and other like vrgent occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
And speaking of some cases of inconuenience,
which hee would haue to bee auoided by <hi>Equiuocation,</hi>
he demandeth,<note n="d" place="margin">Cap. 7. nu. 22. pa. 289.</note> 
                  <hi>Hath God and Nature, and Law of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
left no lawfull euasion in such cases?</hi> And againe,
<note n="e" place="margin">Cap. 7. nu. 2. pag. 274.</note> 
                  <hi>Wee delight not</hi> (saith hee) <hi>in this Arte or maner of eua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
by Equiuocation.</hi> By this it appeareth, that <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation</hi>
(to vse the Iesuites owne words) is an <hi>Art of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:12745:20"/>
euasion,</hi> which cannot bee vnderstood without a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and purpose to deceiue the hearers vnderstanding,
and to make him beleeue an vntrueth. The same Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
of this Arte goeth on, and teacheth vs, that this
their <hi>Equiuocation</hi> is,<note n="a" place="margin">Mitig c. 12. nu 3. pag. 484.</note> 
                  <hi>when any speach hath, or may haue
a double sense, not by any double signification or composition
of the words themselues; but onely by some reseruation of
minde in the speaker, whereby his meaning is made different
from that sense which the words that are vttered, de beare,
or yeeld without that reseruation.</hi> And by this is implyed,
that the purpose of this is, to imprint one sense in the
speaker, which they acknowledge to bee false, and to
keepe within themselues another, which they imagine
to bee true. <hi>Becanus</hi> also, another Iesuite, hauing
first proposed the question, <hi>An liceat vti Aequiuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catione:
Whether it may be lawful to vse Equiuocation:</hi>
he explaineth the point thus;<note n="b" place="margin">Sensus est, an
licea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  <hi>Whether it bee lawfull to
deceiue and beguile others by Equiuocations.</hi> In the prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of which question, though he wrangle, &amp; would
gladly shift off from themselues the imputation of this
<hi>equiuocating</hi> fraud; yea, and flatly denieth it: yet by
explaining the questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in such sort, he acknowledgeth,
that their meaning who defend it, is <hi>to beguile and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
men.</hi> And in like sort <hi>Tolet</hi> saith.<note n="c" place="margin">Aliquando licet vti aquiuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catione, &amp; fallere audientem. <hi>Tolet. Instruct. Sacerd. l. 4. c. 21. nu.</hi> 9.</note> 
                  <hi>It is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
lawfull to vse Equiuocation, and to deceiue the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer.</hi>
And therefore when Father <hi>Persons</hi>
                  <note n="d" place="margin">Mitig. cap. 8 nu. 58. pag. 346 &amp; 347. See also, Sober Reckon. c. 4. nu. 89. pag. 285</note> saith, that
<hi>his intention is not to deceiue in this mentall proposition, but
to defend himselfe, &amp;c.</hi> and that the Priest (who denieth
himselfe to bee a Priest) that his <hi>principall intent is not</hi>
intentio fallendi, <hi>an intention of deceiuing; but rather,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uadendi
desiderium, <hi>a desire to escape and defend himselfe:</hi>
he doth either too boldly presume vpon his Readers
simplicitie, or too grossely bewray his owne. For
first, when hee saith, that his <hi>principall intent is not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue,
but rather to escape,</hi> hee implieth, that an intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he hath to deceiue, though that be not his <hi>principall
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:12745:21"/>
intention;</hi> and that is enough to prooue (which hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth)
that his <hi>Equiuocation</hi> doth herein agree with the
nature of a <hi>lye,</hi> that as a lye is said to bee, <hi>cum intentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
fallendi,</hi> so his <hi>Equiuocation</hi> cannot be denied to haue
the same purpose and intention in it. And secondly,
where he saith plainely that his <hi>intention</hi> is not <hi>to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue,</hi>
but <hi>to defend,</hi> hee speaketh as wisely, and to as
good purpose, as if a thiefe by the high way side should
say, that hee intended not to take away the true mans
purse, but to supplie himselfe with money for his owne
spending. For as the thiefe intendeth to robbe, that
thereby he may supply himselfe; so the Iesuite intendeth
to deceiue, that thereby he may defend himselfe.</p>
               <p>7 <hi>That to forbeare the vse of this</hi> Equiuocation <hi>(vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
where by duety a man is bound to vse it) is better
and more Meritorious then to vse it. To this purpose
speaketh the great Master of this Arte;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mitig. c. 7. nu. 2 pag. 274.</note> Wee delight not
<hi>(saith hee)</hi> in this Arte or maner of euasion by <hi>Equiuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi>
though it be no lye at all; but rather do allow and like
far better of simple, plaine, and resolute speach in all Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes,
concerning aswel matters of ordinary conuersation, as
of their conscience, &amp;c. <hi>And presently he addeth;</hi> Yet for
that perfection is one thing, and obligation is another, wee
may not binde men to more then Gods precept bindeth. <hi>By
which speach hee plainely teacheth, that though it bee
not vnlawfull to vse</hi> Equiuocation, <hi>because it is not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
by any precept; yet it is a worke of perfection,
(such as they vse to cal a worke of supererogation) not
to vse a mans lawfull libertie in this case. And yet
f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rther,</hi> It is euident, that albeit good men desirous of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,<note place="margin">Cap. 7. nu. 5. pag. 276.</note>
and prepared to suffer iniuries, may liue without go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Law, without swearing, without diuorcing their
wiues, without Equiuocation, &amp;c. yet for all that, men are
not bound to this exactnesse, &amp;c. <hi>And yet againe,</hi> My wish
is <hi>(saith hee)</hi> that Catholike people,<note place="margin">Cap. 13. nu. 3. pag. 548.</note> but especially Priests,
whose example must instruct the rest, should yeeld also of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:12745:21"/>
their right, for increase of their merit and Crowne in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
and vse all plainnesse and synceritie in speach, and free
discouering, not onely of their religion, but also of their state,
where it is hurtfull to none but themselues.<note place="margin">See <hi>Persons</hi> also in his Sober Reck. ca. 7. nu. 22, &amp; 23. pag. 484, 485.</note> 
                  <hi>And in a word,</hi>
plainnesse and syncerity <hi>of speach, he compareth with</hi> vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity,
<hi>(which in their esteeme, is a glorious worke of
perfection or supererogation:) and the practice of</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiuocating
<hi>to</hi> Wedlocke, <hi>which is lawful, but not of such
merit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now hence I inferre two Conclusions.</p>
               <p>1 That the practice of Protestants in vsing <hi>plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and syncerity in speach,</hi> according to their doctrine,
is by the confession of the Iesuite, better and more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
then the practice of Papists in vsing <hi>Euasions</hi> and
<hi>Equiuocations,</hi> according to the doctrine of the <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocators.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2 That according to the doctrine of Popish <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocators,</hi>
Iesus our Sauiour was not so perfect, nor vsed
not so much <hi>exactnesse in his speach,</hi> nor <hi>merited</hi> not so
much, as the Iesuites doe, many of them at least. For
Father <hi>Persons</hi> saith, that <hi>albeit good men desirous of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
may liue without Equiuocating, yet &amp;c.</hi> hee mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
that though it may bee seene in such men, yet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
are not bound to that <hi>exactnesse:</hi> and he implieth,
that men <hi>desirous of perfection,</hi> doe vse to doe so. And
such, I trow, the holy Order of <hi>Iesuites is,</hi> who for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of this <hi>perfection,</hi> haue by solemne vow abandoned
the world, and all the glory, and profit belonging to it.
Besides, Father <hi>Persons</hi> graue aduice is, that <hi>not onely
Priests,</hi> but other <hi>Catholikes</hi> too, should <hi>yeeld of their
right,</hi> by forbearing to equiuocate, <hi>for the increase of their
merit and Crowne in heauen:</hi> and, I trowe, the followers
of IESVS will not bee slacke to performe, what one
of their owne Fathers doth aduise to bee so behoofe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
not onely for seculars of the Clergie, but for lay<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:12745:22"/>
Catholikes also. But now IESVS our Lord, see how
farre off the Iesuite maketh him to bee from this degree
of perfection. For hee was so <hi>frequent</hi> in equiuocating,
that Father <hi>Persons</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Sober Reck. Append. nu. 16 pag. 682.</note> 
                  <hi>findeth him to haue vsed the same in
one onely Chapter of S.</hi> Iohns <hi>Gospel, aboue seuen or eight
times at the least.</hi> Nay, and that<note n="b" place="margin">Sober Reck. in append. nu. 24. pag. 687.</note> 
                  <hi>more then one Equiuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
was vsed by our Sauiour in one sentence:</hi> and that
<hi>eight or nine Equiuocall speaches at the least, are contained
within a piece of one onely Chapter of our Sauiours talke
with the Iewes, Scribes and Pharisees.</hi> And indeede hee
hath recited and alleadged nine seuerall examples out
of our Sauiours words, recorded in the latter part of
the eighth Chapter of S. <hi>Iohn.</hi> And sure, hee that did
equiuocate so often in so little compasse, cannot be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
to haue forborne his <hi>right</hi> in this practice, <hi>for the
increase of his merit and Crowne in heauen.</hi> Or if they
will say, that notwithstanding this frequent vse of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiuocation</hi>
in so short space, that yet hee did <hi>forbeare
his right</hi> still, and so <hi>increased his merit</hi> thereby; then
they will giue vs occasion to thinke, that Iesuites and
Priests, and other Roman Catholikes may attaine this
height of <hi>perfection,</hi> vnto which Father <hi>Persons</hi> adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
them, and coozen and deceiue vs silly fellowes with
their <hi>Equiuocations</hi> seuen, or eight, or nine times in one
houre.</p>
               <p>I leaue it then to bee considered by the wise Reader,
whether Father <hi>Persons</hi> doe cog with vs all this while,
and make no small vse of this deceitfull Arte, while hee
laboureth to defend it: or, whether in good earnest hee
thinketh that our Lord and Sauiour did not follow so
<hi>exact</hi> a rule of <hi>perfection,</hi> as hee aduiseth all his Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes
vnto.</p>
               <p>These bee the most speciall properties belonging to
<hi>Iesuiticall Equiuocation,</hi> as neere as I could gather and
obserue them out of their bookes, which bee the abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of this Arte, among whom the principall, Father
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:12745:22"/>
                  <hi>Persons,</hi> must needes bee acknowledged to bee. For
hee hath laboured herein more then they all. Out of
all which obseruations layd together, I leaue it to the
consideration of any vnderstanding man, to iudge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
these two things doe not follow.</p>
               <p>1 That the Roman Doctors haue such rare wits, as
that they can by their deuised sleights, transforme the
nature both of words and things, euen as well as Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymists

Where it must be noted, that when he mentioneth 400
yeeres, his meaning is not to limit the approbation of
this <hi>Arte</hi> to the compasse of those yeeres; but because
he supposeth, but falsely, that his Aduersarie had gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
so much; and so here he disputeth <hi>ex Concessis</hi> vpon
the Confession of his Aduersarie: but he intendeth and
meaneth the consent of former times also; as himselfe

for who can say or presume, that hee knoweth

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:12745:24"/>
will say, that wheras the Abettors of <hi>Equiuocation</hi> haue
bin challenged by two learned Doctors in our Church,
to shewe any who in former times haue allowed this
diuelish <hi>Arte;</hi> hitherto I haue seene no one man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
who doth giue any plaine or direct allowance
heereof. For as for the many autorities, which <hi>Persons</hi>
doth alledge, they be Conclusions of his own, spun out
of other mens sayings, by such consequences as himselfe
fancieth or pleaseth to frame. For where holy or lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
men haue vsed speeches, that may admit diuers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations,
either by reason of the words vsed, or
some circumstance occurring, according to which only
former Ages were wont to expound them; he present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
runneth away with an out-cry of <hi>mentall reseruation,</hi>
or <hi>mixt Proposition:</hi> as euery man that considereth the
Allegations, may easily perceiue. In a word, <hi>Persons</hi>
claimeth very boldly, and to speake truth, impudently,
<hi>Vniuersality, Antiquity,</hi> and <hi>Consent,</hi> for this nouell,
new-deuised, and vpstart fancie of their owne. Where
I wish the Reader to consider, how farre he may credit
such men, when they lay the like claime to all <hi>Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Consent</hi> of Nations, either for the prouing of
their Church, or for maintaining of any other subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
point of Controuersie. For mine owne part, till
they shew me one who approued <hi>a mentall Equiuocation</hi>
or <hi>reseruation,</hi> I will thinke and say there is none. And
this is my first assertion; whereof see further proofe in
the next assertion.</p>
               <p>2 My second is, that the latter sort of Schoole-men
and <hi>Casuists</hi> gaue occasion, and laied grounds for this
ensuing <hi>Arte;</hi> which at that time themselues, it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,
did not so much as thinke or dreame of. For,
whereas some Cases were then debated, how farre a
<hi>Priest</hi> might deny the things which hee had heard in
Confession; and in what sort any man that was que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned
by an vnlawfull Iudge, or proceeded against in
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:12745:25"/>
an vnlalwfull maner, &amp;c. might deny the things which
he knew to be true: they, considering the <hi>circumstances
of the persons, place, and businesse,</hi> did allow some hard
<hi>Equiuocations,</hi> which the words would hardly beare in
any true sense, yet such as they thought might be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and gathered out of those circumstances, and might
well be vnderstood in those words, as there and then
they were vttered. As for exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple; If a Priest were questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
whether he knew or had heard any thing of such
or such a matter; he might say, <hi>No:</hi> if he did not know
or heare it any other way, but onely by <hi>Confession.</hi> And
the reason of this answere is, because,<note n="a" place="margin">Voces co modo significant, quo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

therefore he concludeth, that that answere in this case

Suppose a Tyran should aske of a Priest, whether <hi>Peter</hi>
(for example) <hi>did kill Iohn</hi> (which the Priest knew in

dayes, such for example sake, as Thomas Aquinas is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Out of which testimonies and sayings of these two
learned men (the one of which was <hi>Confessor</hi> to <hi>Charles</hi>
the fifth, and the other his <hi>Historiographer;</hi> and the one
flourished about the yeere 1560. as <hi>Possouin</hi> saith, and
the other died in the yeere 1572. saith the same <hi>Posse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin,</hi>
out of these their sayings) I gather and obserue
these things.</p>
               <p>1 That in the dayes of these two learned men,
which was about some 60 yeeres agoe, there was little
or no speach of any <hi>Equiuocation</hi> by <hi>mentall reseruation,</hi>
or of any such <hi>mixt propositions,</hi> as the Romanists now
fancie. This I gather, first, because <hi>Soto,</hi> in oppugning
these ambiguous Answeres and speaches allowed by
some <hi>Schoole-Doctors</hi> of that time, doth no where (to
my knowledge) charge them with any such opinion,
or euer labour to refute it. Which (considering the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
that hee had in hand, and the diligence that he
vsed in handling of it, and cleering of all doubts that
belonged vnto it) no man may with reason imagine
that hee would haue for borne to doe, if those times had
giuen occasion of disputing such a question. Secondly,
the same learned man, in oppugning that liberty, which
others did grant, doth still ouerthrowe or confute their
opinion, because the interpretation and the meaning
which they doe allow those answeres to be taken in
by the speaker, are such as doe not agree to the vse and
signification of the words spoken, nor cannot bee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to them, without incongruity and absurditie. By
which reason of his, hee implieth, that these <hi>Diuines</hi>
meant no other ambiguity, or interpretation, or mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
in those answeres, then such as they thought,
the words in that case in which they were vttered
might beare. Or els his reason had beene insufficient
and foolish; which yet he supposeth to be such, as that
his aduersaries could not dislike as impertinent, if the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:12745:27"/>
thing which he vrged were true. Thirdly, the same Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
doth still so set down his opinion, that in the cases
proposed, and others of the like nature; he alloweth any
ambiguity or Amphibologie,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>which the vse of the speach
can beare without a lye,</hi> as in expresse words hee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth
himselfe, but refuseth and condemneth all
such, as is not noted and implied in the words. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>Sepulueda,</hi> he also disputeth against those, who think
themselues not bound in the cases propounded to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
according to the common meaning, and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the words: and confuteth them, who hold it
lawfull simply to denie the crime truely layed to their
charge, although they <hi>purposely speake some other thing in
their minde, Which the Iudge, taking their words in the
common meaning, vnderstandeth not:</hi> Cap. 17. &amp; through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the whole Booke. But yet I haue not obserued in
all that Booke any speach, in which hee mentioneth a
<hi>mixt proposition,</hi> a <hi>mentall Equiuocation,</hi> or an ambigui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
made by a <hi>reseruation</hi> Against which opinion, (if
there had then appeared any such to the world) hee
might haue disputed with more probabilitie and
shewe of substantiall reason. But he no where (as farre
as I can obserue) either refelleth or mentioneth any
such opinion among these late and punie Diuines.
For wheras in the place last cited, he hath these words,
<hi>though purposely he speaketh some other thing in his minde,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> ex in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustria aliud praeter ea mente liquatur.</note>
that maketh nothing, as I thinke, for the <hi>mentall reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,</hi>
which our <hi>Equiuocators</hi> haue deuised. For he
meaneth nothing else, as I take it, but that the speaker
doth frame in his minde, another sense and meaning of
his words, then they in the common vnderstanding of
men doe make, or then the <hi>Iudge</hi> according to the
common vnderstauding doth take them in. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
those very Schoole-Diuines, whom hee and <hi>Soto</hi>
doe refute for going too farre, and allowing too much
liberty, yet goe not so farre as our now Iesuites doe,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:12745:27"/>
who build all vpon a fancied <hi>reseruation</hi> of their owne
framing, no way included in the words spoken. Fiftly,
say that those Diuines, whom these learned men doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute,
did maintaine such a <hi>mixt proposition,</hi> &amp; <hi>mentall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation</hi>
as our <hi>Romanists</hi> doe striue for: yet <hi>Soto</hi> saith,
that he had read no Schoole-Doctor, who allowed such
a fancie as <hi>Adrain</hi> imagined, which yet by a <hi>reserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of a Iesuite, might easily bee solued. And <hi>Sepulueda,</hi>
when hee came out of <hi>Italy</hi> into <hi>Spaine,</hi> thought it
strange, that hee found <hi>Diuines,</hi> who contrary to the
meaning of all the <hi>Ancients,</hi> did allow that opinion,
which he there refuteth. And therefore if we shall say,
that the <hi>Diuines</hi> against whom these men wrote, did
hold this <hi>Equiuocall reseruation,</hi> yet it was then a nouell
opinion, lately sprung vp, such as <hi>Soto</hi> had read in no
Schoole-Doctor of former time, and such as <hi>Sepulueda</hi>
did maruell to finde set on foote in his owne Countrey,
where he liued. But, as I said, these learned men did
not know of any such opinion risen vp at that time. And
therefore in those dayes either this <hi>Arte</hi> was not yet
found, or if it were, it was rather whispered in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
or taught obscurely, then published in Schooles.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I gather out of these learned mens wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
alleadged before, that <hi>Schoole-Doctors</hi> about that
time, allowed and gaue liberty for such ambiguities, as
in opinion of these men, and in trueth the words could
not beare: and therefore their interpretations were
forced &amp; violent, and such as could not free their spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
from being <hi>lyes.</hi> This without further deduction,
is euident by the words before cited.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I obserue, that these hard and harsh <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocations,</hi>
by some <hi>Diuines</hi> then allowed, and the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
constructions that they made of the words, were
then newly taken vp, and were vnknowne to the elder
and more iudicious <hi>Schoole-men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And out of all this, I leaue it to the iudgement of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:12745:28"/>
the learned Reader, whether I may not vpon good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
inferre; that therefore in all probabilitie, the later
sort of <hi>Schoole-Doctors,</hi> by the hard <hi>Equiuocations,</hi>
which they allowed, did giue occasion &amp; layd grounds
for this <hi>Iesuiticall Art</hi> of <hi>Equiuocation,</hi> though at that
time themselues did not thinke of it. For, may it not
hence be reasonably conceiued, that the progresse and
proceeding to the framing of this <hi>Art,</hi> was on this
manner? that first of all, and in elder times, there was
nothing, but <hi>simplicitie</hi> in their Oathes and answers, or
if any <hi>ambiguitie</hi> was allowed to be vsed, it was but in
some such sense, as the <hi>circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stances</hi> of the persons, time,
place, and occasion, did put vpon them, and that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the intention of publique Lawes, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
construction that the Hearers might make of
them: and that afterward they allowed violent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions,
and such as the words, together with the
<hi>circumstances,</hi> could not beare, in any reasonable mans
vnderstanding, but such as the speaker, in his minde
did fancie to be agreeable to that businesse and occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And lastly, that this ouer-bold liberty in them,
in framing such a sense, as the words in reason &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itie
could not beare, made way to fine wits following
after, to adde something to the former inuention, and
to frame a sense of words spoken, which they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
not to be signified by them, but made vp by a
<hi>Reseruation</hi> in their owne breast, such as themselues
would please to fancie, what euer it were, either per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
to the businesse, or as farre different from it, as
the <hi>falling of the skie</hi> is different from the <hi>paying of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</hi>
But this will appeare yet more plainely, if it be
considered, that <hi>Nauarre,</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Nauar. Com. in c. Humanae aures, q. 1. nu. 4. &amp; nu. 8. &amp; 9.</note> who liued at the same
time with <hi>Soto,</hi> &amp; <hi>Sepulueda,</hi> but wrote after them, and
when they were dead, doth from the opinion of those
Diuines, and in speciall from the opinion of <hi>Soto</hi> also,
and from his sayings, labour to inferre and proue the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:12745:28"/>
lawfulnesse of the <hi>Iesuiticall Equiuocation;</hi> because (as
hee saith) there is the like reason of them both. How
truely he inferreth his Conclusion, from the sayings of
<hi>Soto</hi> and the rest, I dispute not; I onely note in his
course of disputation, that hee taketh their assertions
for a ground to proue his owne by. And that sheweth
that those former Writers gaue occasion, &amp;c. And thus
I haue declared my second Assertion concerning the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall
of this new Art.</p>
               <p>3. The third is, that whosesoeuer wit deuised it,
yet it seemeth to mee most probable, that it receiued
the first life and credit from the See of Rome, and the
Romane state. My reason is from these grounds.</p>
               <p>1. Doctor <hi>Nauarre,</hi> who (as <hi>Persons</hi> saith, <hi>Mitig.
cap. 7. nu. 41. pag. 301.) is held to be one of the most libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
and largest in admitting Equiuocations both in words
and oathes,</hi> was thought a fit man to be the Popes <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Cases</hi> in Rome. And if I mistake not, hee was
the first that broached this <hi>new arte.</hi> For hee read at
Rome not long after the time of <hi>Soto</hi> and <hi>Sepulueda,</hi>
who (as before was noted) had not yet heard any thing
of this <hi>arte.</hi> And there he read &amp; framed that<note n="a" place="margin">Praefat. ante initium Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentar. in c. Human. aures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary,
in which he teacheth this <hi>mysterie,</hi> for the
instruction of the Iesuits Colledge and dedicated the
same vnto <hi>Gregorie</hi> 13. the present Pope: which may
breede suspition, that the Pope was well pleased with
this new deuice of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> of whom he made choise
to be his publique <hi>Reader of Cases;</hi> and who, while he
was imployed in this seruice, did perfect that arte, and
from whose Readings, the very Iesuits themselues may
seeme to haue borrowed the grounds of that Doctrine,
which afterward they polished with great dexteritie
and care.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In <hi>Queene Elizabeths</hi> time, there was a
Treatise found out, which before was in the secret kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
of Iesuits or Priests: in which, beside the Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:12745:29"/>
of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> were contayned sundry instructions
and directions, giuen by <hi>Sixtus Quintus,</hi> for the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctising
of this mysterie of <hi>Equiuocation.</hi> Which, if the
Reader be desirous to know more fully, hee may reade

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, I finde that <hi>Emm. Sà</hi> in his <hi>Aphorismes</hi>

                  <hi>Where a man is not bound to reueale the truth according
to the intention of the Demander, some say, that a man may
answere by vnderstanding or reseruing something in his
minde, as that is not so, to wit so, as that hee is bound to
tell him: or that hee hath not such a thing, meaning, that
hee hath it not to giue it vnto him. But others admit not
of this kinde of answere; and perhaps, vpon better ground
and reason.</hi> Thus hee gaue his iudgement of this poynt;
and so the Booke passed in the Low Countries, and
with approbation and commendation of <hi>Silu. Pardo,</hi>
the Inquisitor and Censor there, and was printed at
<hi>Antwerpe</hi> 1599. But when it came to be perused,
and reuewed at <hi>Rome,</hi> the Censor there, <hi>Io. Maria,</hi>
Master of the <hi>sacred Palace,</hi> he purged the Booke, and
put out the last words, which were,<note n="c" place="margin">Et sortè po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiori ratione.</note>

               <p>Now these considerations layed together, make mee

                  <hi>It is a cleare case,

polished it, I finde to be English men.</hi> Yea and their owne
Brethren, the Secular Priests, lay the ouer-bold vse
of <hi>Equiuocation</hi> in their dish.<note n="e" place="margin">Reply to Father Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons Libell, fol. 22. &amp;c 23.</note> 
                  <hi>For so famous</hi> (say they)
<hi>and so notorious are their Equiuocations, and so scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
that the very Protestants take notice thereof, &amp;c.</hi>
and, <hi>such iugglings, and shiftings of late haue beene vsed
by them, that not onely Protestants, but also Catholickes,
yea Priests can scarse tell when they speake sincerely, when
otherwise.</hi> And a little after, <hi>Howsoeuer this kinde of
dealing may seeme excusable vnto them, vnder the name of
honest Equiuocation; sure I am that few honest men will
excuse it from dishonest lying.</hi> And Master <hi>Watson</hi>

these Equiuocations, <hi>their absurd paradoxes of Equiuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi>
And the like speeches may be found in diuers
other places of the Priests bookes. By all which it may
appeare, that learned men on both sides, not onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Protestants, but also among <hi>Popish Priests,</hi>
haue noted this deuice especially in the <hi>Iesuits:</hi> which
may be reason enough, (beside that which is to be found
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:12745:30"/>
in their owne writings) to make any sober man resolue,
that the <hi>Iesuites</hi> haue had their fingers chiefly in this
new deuised <hi>Arte.</hi> And reason may perswade the
same to be most likely; because the <hi>Iesuites</hi> are an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
consecrated and deuoted from their very first birth
to the <hi>Popes</hi> will, to doe what may serue his turne. For
so the <hi>Iesuites</hi> themselues, who published <hi>Sanchez.</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
worke, doe professe in the Epistle Dedicatorie to
Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> 15.<note n="a" place="margin">Prefixed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond tome.</note> that their first founder<note n="b" place="margin">Se suamque Societatem Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisieijs imperijs more pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>did make
himselfe and his Order or Societie vassals to the Popes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund,
in a new and vnheard of manner.</hi> And therefore
if the <hi>See and State</hi> of Rome, did (as before I shewed)
giue life, and credit and authoritie to this <hi>Arte;</hi> then,
in reason it must be conceiued that the <hi>Iesuites,</hi> who by
their first institution are created the Popes <hi>vassals,</hi> to
serue at his pleasure, and to doe his will, would be the
most forward in the ranke, to vphold and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
with all their wit, this deare Childe of the Popes
owne breeding. And yet when I conclude that the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits
are the most forward, and the men that haue po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
this Arte, my meaning is not, either to include
all of that Order within this compasse, or to exclude
all others not of that Order from it. For first among
the Iesuites, <hi>Becanus</hi> doth disclaime it, as<note n="c" place="margin">Manual. Controu. l. 5. cap. 21. &amp; O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pusc. Theolog. tom. 1.

Wherein hee saith well, that it is <hi>vnlawfull;</hi> but
ill, that it is not taught by the <hi>Iesuites.</hi> For their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
this way is so cleare, and so open to the view of
all men, that <hi>Becanus</hi> in denying it, must needes either
vse the Arte of <hi>Equiuocation,</hi> which himselfe condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
or else tell a flat and downe-right lye, which is
not much better. And the like may be noted in the
writings of some other Iesuites, who deny and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
this deuice. But they had best keepe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
from Rome; for if they come in the <hi>Censors</hi>
hands, it is to be feared hee will deale with them, as
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:12745:31"/>
he hath done with their felow <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> already; that is, circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
their lips, and teach their pens to speake the <hi>Roman
Language</hi> more purely. Secondly, among those that be
no Iesuites, wee haue experience and examples good
store, of them who haue learned this <hi>Arte,</hi> and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
it as stiffely, as the best Iesuite can. In which
number, I may place Doctor <hi>Norrice,</hi> who beeing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
in <hi>Oxford,</hi> denyed himselfe to bee a <hi>Priest,</hi>
and afterward in prison did defend it by this sleight of
<hi>Equiuocation,</hi> and that he maintained to be lawfull, by
the example of our blessed Sauiour; <hi>Mar. 13. 32. But of
that day &amp; houre knoweth no man, neither the Son, &amp;c.</hi> and
<hi>Ioh. 7. 8. Ego non ascendam, &amp;c.</hi> For so he then alledged
the place, as Father <hi>Persons</hi> also doth, against both the
<hi>Greeke,</hi> and their owne approued <hi>Latine.</hi> In expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
and applying of which Texts to his purpose, how
weakely he behaued himselfe, he may now bee pleased
to call to his remembrance: that as he braggeth of his
victories ouer other men, so for his humiliation, hee
may sometimes call to mind his owne infirmities. And
that perhaps may stand his soule in as good stead, as the
meritorious forbearing of <hi>Equiuocation,</hi> when he might
lawfully vse it: which (as Father <hi>Persons</hi> saith) may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
his Crowne and merit in heauen.</p>
               <p>But in earnest, he shall doe well, if in the next editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his Antidote, he place this question of <hi>Equiuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
among the rest of his Controuersies, and tell vs in
good sadnes, what, after so many yeeres more, he thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
of this Point. But in the meane while, the Reader
may vnderstand, that D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Norrice</hi> is not the only man
that ioyneth with the Iesuites in the practice and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of this <hi>Arte.</hi> For in this small Treatise may
be seene diuers testimonies for it, out of other Writers.
And the secular Priests, though they charge &amp; vpbraid
the Iesuites with a <hi>nimium,</hi> too often and too bold a
practice of it, yet themselues doe allow it, euen when
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:12745:31"/>
they shew greatest opposition against the Iesuites. So
Master <hi>Watson</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Quod lib. 3. art. 4. p. 66, 67.</note> speaking of <hi>Equiuocation,</hi> as <hi>a shift</hi>
which the Iesuites vse; saith, that <hi>though there bee no
question to bee made of it, but that in some sense it may bee
lawfull, &amp;c.</hi> In which place, the sum of that, wherein
he sheweth his dissent &amp; dislike of the Iesuites, (for his
owne words are too many to be set down in this place)
is in these two things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> First, That the Iesuites doe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<hi>Equiuocation</hi> in a case, wherein he thinketh a man
is bound to speake the plaine truth. And secondly, that
<hi>they doe hold, that they may not onely to their Aduersaries</hi>
(to Protestants) <hi>but euen also to any Catholike Magistrate,
yea to the Pope himselfe, answere one way, and meane ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
And to like purpose, the Author of the Replie to
<hi>Persons</hi> Apologie, beeing to answere for D. <hi>Bagshaw,</hi>
whom <hi>Persons</hi> had reprooued, as denying the doctrine
of <hi>Equiuocation;</hi> saith, that the Doctor,<note n="b" place="margin">Cap. 17. in the very end pag. 331.</note> 
                  <hi>no doubt, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in what cases doubtfull answeres and Equiuocations are
to be made to curious questions: neither is it to bee thought</hi>
(saith he) <hi>that he dissallowed thereof, but onely of the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which is in the Iesuites and their Adherenes, in all their
dealings with other men.</hi> By which it may appeare, that
the difference betweene the Secular Priests and the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites
in this point, is not about the equitie &amp; lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of this Arte, but about the liberty and large scope
that the Iesuites take, to practise it among their owne
Brethren, and before their owne Magistrates and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours,
and in all their dealings. And surely, for our
owne experience, I cannot learne any thing to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie,
but that our Tribunals and places of Iudicature,
our Bishops, Iustices, and other Officers, who haue to
deale in their Examinations, yea and that our common
sort of Christians who conuerse with them, doe find in
their experience, that Secular Priests, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ale Papists
of all sorts, doe iumpe with the Iesuites in the practice
of this Arte. Notwithstanding, if any among them,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:12745:32"/>
which call themselues Catholikes, doe renounce and
disclaime it, as well in deedes as in words; I am so far
from fastening any imputation of disgrace vpon them
for this iniquitie of their brethren, as that I wish and
pray they may goe on, to forsake and abandon all other
the abominations and errors of the Roman Church.
But (to draw toward an end in this Point) all things
considered, my Conclusion commeth to this head;
That this <hi>mystery of iniqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ty</hi> spreadeth farre and neere
in the Papall Kingdome, hauing receiued authority and
countenance from the very <hi>Roman See,</hi> and finding en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainement
and acceptance among all inferiour sorts:
but yet the Iesuites are they that haue chiefely polished
it, and most boldly practised it; and among the Iesuites,
our <hi>English-men</hi> (be it spoken to the credite of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
doe beare the bell away. And from hence the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
may see why our Diuines doe vsually ascribe this
Doctrine to the Iesuites: and consequently what wee

businesses with their neighboures, so that <hi>any body should
be hurt</hi> or beguiled by them. For first, where he saith,
that they may not vse <hi>Equiuocation</hi> in <hi>matters of faith,</hi>
perhaps in this saying he doth <hi>equiuocate</hi> with vs; and
meaneth, that we may not so vse <hi>Equiuocation,</hi> as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
any point of <hi>faith.</hi> But that in handling &amp; dealing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<hi>matters of faith,</hi> it may bee lawfull with them to

                  <hi>in matters of Religion, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
to the faith of the hearer-to seeke out the speakers
reseruation for his better assurance.</hi> Which is but a sclen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
comfort to a poore Christian, who had as good
seeke a <hi>Needle</hi> in a bottle of hay, as a <hi>reseruation</hi> locked
vp in an <hi>Equiuocators</hi> mind: but hence it followeth,
that he alloweth <hi>Equiuocation</hi> in <hi>matters of Religion.</hi> A-Againe,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:12745:33"/>
the same Father <hi>Persons</hi> telleth vs, that<note n="a" place="margin">Mitig. cap. 13. nu. 3. p. 548.</note> 
                  <hi>no
man can deny, but many facts and cases may fall out con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
matters of Religion, not tending to Confession (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
in time of persecution) wherein a man may, or
perhaps also must by obligation vse equiuocall speeches.</hi>
Here he granteth, that by their principles, it is an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
conclusion, that in cases concerning Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
a man may equiuocate, so the case be not such, as
tendeth to <hi>Confession;</hi> 1. as I vnderstand it, if by equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocating
he doe not seeme to deny the Roman faith,
which at such times, they hold it necessarie for their
Children, without any tergiuersation to confesse. But
elsewhere hee vnfoldeth himselfe a little more plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
when he saith of Equiuocation,<note n="b" place="margin">Sober Rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon. in Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend. nu. 25. pag. 687.</note> 
                  <hi>that it may not be
vsed in matters of Religion, where Confession of our Faith
is required.</hi> For this implyeth, that where Confession
of faith is not required, there it may be lawfull enough
to equiuocate. But euident and cleare it is, that the
<note n="c" place="margin">Mitigat. cap. 9. num. 25. &amp; seqq.</note> Iesuite maketh our blessed Sauiour to equiuocate in
sundry <hi>matters of Religion,</hi> and thence would perswade
vs, that by his example, they may doe the like. As for
example, hee did equiuocate, when he said of the day
of Iudgement,<note n="d" place="margin">Mar. 13. 32.</note> 
                  <hi>Of that day and houre knoweth no man,
nor the Sonne, &amp;c.</hi> And when hee said of himselfe,<note n="e" place="margin">Ioh. 8. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>I
iudge no man:</hi> the Iesuite saith, that this speech <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a mentall reseruation is false,</hi> and <hi>cannot stand, for that
it should be contrary to many other places of Scripture:</hi>
and should imply a deniall of Christs office to be our
Iudge. He proceedeth to other examples, and telleth
vs, that Christ did equiuocate about the Sacrament of
Baptisme, when he said,<note n="f" place="margin">Mar. 16. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Hee that shall beleeue, and be
baptized, shall be saued:</hi> and about eating of the flesh of
Christ,<note n="g" place="margin">Ioh. 6. 51.</note> 
                  <hi>If any man shall eate of this bread, hee shall liue
for euer:</hi> and about Prayer, when hee said,<note n="h" place="margin">Ioh. 16. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>If ye shall
aske any thing of my Father in my name, he will giue it you.</hi>
Now the points here spoken of, and others of like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:12745:33"/>
in which the Iesuite findeth Equiuocation to
haue beene vsed in Scriptures, are, I trow, <hi>matters of
faith and Religion.</hi> And hence it followeth, that Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocators
must either confesse that they abuse the world
in alledging these and such like Texts, to proue and
vphold Iesuiticall Equiuocation, which is not there
meant; or that they hold their Equiuocations to be
lawfull, and sufficiently warranted, euen in principall
<hi>matters of Religion,</hi> such as are Christs office of iudging,
the doctrine of the Sacraments, and prayer in Christs
name. In the first place then, when <hi>Persons</hi> excepteth
<hi>matters of faith</hi> from the practice of <hi>Equiuocation,</hi> hee
mocketh his Reader with generall speeches, when hee
meaneth no such thing; but onely that men may not
<hi>equiuocate,</hi> by denying in words their beliefe of <hi>the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
faith,</hi> or some such like. Secondly, where <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>
saith that they allow not <hi>equiuocation</hi> in <hi>common
conuersation, in buying, &amp;c.</hi> it may be obserued that

that wee haue it not; vnderstanding, <hi>with any

there is a mysterie in those words, which<note n="g" place="margin">In c. Human. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

without sinne and iniustice. And then, the meaning of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:12745:34"/>
this goodly Exception of <hi>Persons,</hi> will be this; that
in <hi>buying, and selling, and humane traffique,</hi> and <hi>common
conuersation,</hi> wee may not <hi>equiuocate,</hi> if thereby wee
doe <hi>hurt</hi> any man <hi>vniustly and vnlawfully:</hi> but else, if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of their Catholiques should thinke that the <hi>hurt</hi>
which redoundeth to one of vs, is <hi>lawfull</hi> and <hi>iust,</hi> that
then they may freely delude vs with their <hi>amphibolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies</hi>
and <hi>reseruations,</hi> in what matter soeuer, and for
what end they please, though it were for <hi>massacring</hi> of
an assembly, or for <hi>murdering</hi> of a Prince, or for <hi>blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
vp of a Parliament,</hi> or for the <hi>inuasion of the</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
by hostile and forraine forces. And so by this
exception we are well freed from the feare of these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luding
and <hi>equiuocating</hi> spirits. Let vs then dismisse
<hi>Persons,</hi> with his shifting Exceptions and enquire more
particularly and directly what the cases be, wherein
they doe in sober sadnesse allow their Schollers to vse
the benefit of this <hi>Art.</hi> And for this purpose I finde
two things said by them. First, that whensoeuer a
man may lawfully keepe silence, and say nothing, or
whensoeuer hee is not bound to reueale and lay open
the truth, then hee may lawfully equiuocate, and vse
this sleight of amphibologie: be it a <hi>matter of faith,</hi> or
a businesse of <hi>commerce and traffique,</hi> or a poynt of <hi>State,</hi>
or what else you will, it mattereth not to this purpose.
For proofe of this, first take the resolution of Father
<hi>Garnet.</hi> He being prisoner in the Tower, and required
to declare his opinion concerning this point, set downe

<hi>then honest sport vsed for lawfull recreation, may make
the vse of Equiuocation lawfull. But if there were an oath
added, then it is an euident fault, because of the vaine and
indiscreet vsing of Gods Name.</hi> So speaketh the same
Author not long after. From which words of the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite
we may gather two things. 1. That an easie cause
may suffice for iustifying of <hi>Equiuocall</hi> speeches, in a
simple assertion without an oath. If there bee no other
cause but onely for <hi>merriment</hi> and <hi>recreation,</hi> yet that is
reason inough to make the vse of <hi>Equiuocation</hi> lawfull
and <hi>honest.</hi> 2. That when other <hi>Equiuocators</hi> doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
some kind of necessity or vtility which may draw
men to vse it; they are to be vnderstood of <hi>Equiuocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
ioyned with an oath, and not when it is vsed in a
bare and simple affirmation or negation: vnlesse wee
may conceiue, that sport and merriment goeth with
them for a matter of necessite or great moment. And
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:12745:36"/>
indeed, this difference giuen by Father <hi>Sanchez,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
<hi>Equiuocation</hi> with an oath, and without it, hath
reason in it, if we consider their grounds and principles.
For in affirmations and negations, there are two things
required. 1. That no lye be told: for this is required
by the negatiue precept of truth, as they vse to speake.
And this fault, as they thinke, they auoide by their
<hi>arte</hi> of <hi>Reseruation.</hi> And secondly, that men conceale
not a truth, when they are bound to disclose it: for
this is required by the affirmatiue precept of <hi>truth.</hi>
But in an Oath, besides truth in the speech, there is a
third thing required, and that is, that it be vndertaken
with iudgement, that is to say, aduisedly and with due
discretion. Else, by swearing a truth <hi>vnaduisedly,</hi> Gods
Name may be prophaned. There is reason then for this
difference which <hi>Sanchez</hi> maketh. And now by all
this, the Reader may see, that an easie cause is thought
sufficient for the vsing of this <hi>Arte.</hi> If it be for ease of
the body, safety of a mans goods, preseruing of his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite,
&amp;c. then by their doctrine, a man may <hi>equiuocate</hi>
with an Oath: but if it be for <hi>sport</hi> and <hi>merriment</hi> only,
yet then it may bee lawfull in affirmations and negati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
without an Oath: prouided that it be such a case,
in which a man may lawfully hold his peace, and bee
not bound then to disclose the <hi>truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this it appeareth in generall, in what cases they
allow the vse of this <hi>Arte.</hi> But for fuller satisfaction of
the Reader, and for more distinct conceiuing of their
meaning in this point; it will not bee amisse to point
out some speciall and particular Cases, in which they
giue expresse leaue for the practising of this sleight.
And they be these, and such like.</p>
               <p>1 If a Priest, that hath heard another mans Confession,
should be demanded, whether such a one had confessed such a
sinne vnto him, or not;—he may answere directly, that hee
hath not confessed any such thing vnto him, albeit hee had
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:12745:36"/>
done so: <hi>yea,</hi> he may sweare also this answere of his, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
and reseruing in his minde, that the Penitent
hath not confessed the same vnto him, so as he may vtter it.

vse of Equiuocation, and require a man vpon his oath not to
vse any Equiuocation, and that he meaneth what he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
without any Equiuocation at all <hi>(as it is in the Oath
of Allegiance)</hi> yet he may sweare it still, vnderstanding,
so as he ought to speake plainely; or framing some other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation
in his mind, by which it may be made true.</p>
               <p>These and such like be the cases, in which they allow
their Equiuocating fraudes. I could adde more, but I
feare I haue wearied the Reader by too many already.</p>
               <p>Surely, by this that hath beene said, we may learne
two things, which it is requisite all plaine-meaning
Christians should take notice of.</p>
               <p>1 That <hi>Equiuocators,</hi> and such as are instructed in this
<hi>Arte,</hi> doe take vnto themselues a large liberty of vsing
this fraudulent deuice. For out of the premises it may
appeare, that whatsoeuer busines or occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be offered,
be the matter sacred or ciuill, publike or priuate, in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
Courts of Iustice, or in common practice of life; yet
if they can perswade themselues that they haue any <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
cause</hi> to conceale the truth, whether it be for some
good to their soules, or for safety of their bodies, or kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
of their goods, &amp;c. they may freely sweare the
contrary to that truth, by an <hi>Equiuocall</hi> or mentall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation.
And if they haue any light cause or reason, if
it be but for <hi>sport</hi> or <hi>merriment</hi> to recreate themselues,
then they may deceiue vs by an <hi>Equiuocation,</hi> in a sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
affirmation or negation, hauing no Oath in it.</p>
               <p>And this being so, I desire euery Christian, that would
not be deceiued, to consider with himselfe, whether he
can thinke of any busines that passeth between man and
man, in which hee may promise to himselfe plaine dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
or may presume that he shall not bee deceiued by
some <hi>mortall deuice</hi> or other, if hee haue to doe with
them, who doe professe this Equouicating Arte.</p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:12745:38"/>
               <p>Secondly, we may learne, that there is no limitation,
or exception, or explication, be it neuer so wise or wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
nor any thing which mans wit can deuise, that may
restraine or keepe backe these <hi>Equiuocators,</hi> from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luding
vs by their equiuocall speeches; but that say or
doe what a man will or can, they will take libertie to
<hi>equiuocate</hi> still: so that no Oathes, how warily and
carefully soeuer they be framed, can hold these men,
further then themselues will.<note n="a" place="margin">Vide intanta astutia quanta sit simplicitat, Quii omnem sec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

A great priuiledge sure for them, that can so easily
winde themselues out of bands, euen the strongest that
can be thought of, among men. And yet me thinketh,
<hi>aliud admirabilius,</hi> the <hi>Equiuocators</hi> haue found a more

a man to Rome, to fetch a <hi>dispensation</hi> thence, or
to get the Popes <hi>declaration</hi> of the vnlawfulnesse of the
Oath, and then they may breake all. But our <hi>Equiuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cators</hi>
haue that at home, and within their own brests,
that may free them from all. For if themselues doe but
thinke that the thing is vnlawfull, or that they haue
some reasonable cause, to dissemble, they may take this
or any other Oath whatsoeuer, and by an <hi>equiuocall</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation,
breake the band of that Oath, before they
take it. And if such be the priuiledges of these men,
how great is their danger, that liue and conuerse with

of the Magistrate, be hee neuer so vigilant and
carefull. For if one of them be examined or asked,
whether hee haue reconciled such a man to the Pope,
or absolued such a subiect from his bond of Allegiance,
or haue conspired against the life of the King, or haue
beene acquainted with a plot of blowing vp the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;
though all these things be most true, yet hee
may without scruple deny them all vpon his Oath. Or
in case one be detected otherwise, and examined, who

the Iesuites for it, yet when they are examined be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

hold all lying to be so sinfull, that they may not tell
a lye for the sauing of a soule, it were too hard a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure

they would so wilfully thrust themselues on

can say any thing, neuer so false, and yet by a <hi>reseruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
make it as true as the Gospell.</p>
               <p>This consideration maketh mee not to maruell,

or honest minde, could let passe out of their
mouthes, or from their pens, such shamefull and yet
shamelesse fictions. For example (to giue the Reader a

a great <hi>mawle,</hi> that battered their <hi>Babel;</hi> and of him

noyse, which <hi>frighted all the Citizens out of their

neither bodie, nor bones, nor graue-clothes to be seene; but
so hellish a stinke came out of his graue, as with the poyson
of it, it had almost killed the standers by.</hi> And all this
while <hi>Luther</hi> was aliue, and did helpe to demolish their

                  <hi>a little before his death had recanted his Religion
in a ful Assembly of the Senators of Geneua, beseeching them
that if euer they would be saued, they should renounce Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uins
errours, and betake themselues to the profession of the
Romish faith; that for more full testification of his vnfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Conuersion, after his death hee desired them to send
for and to be aduised and directed by the Iesuites;</hi> that
hereupon <hi>the Pope had appointed the Bishop of Geneua to
absolue Beza, and other learned men,</hi> such as could be had
neere at hand, <hi>to goe to Geneua, and consider of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse,
and deale with the Inhabitants, if any were more
backeward, about points and Articles of Religion in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.</hi>
After which Relation, the Reporter addeth,
that this newes is <hi>most certaine and true; as may appeare
by the numberlesse company of letters written to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
and will</hi> (as hee saith) <hi>appeare at the next Franck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
Mart, by the store of Bookes which would then flye
abroad in the World,</hi> for the witnessing of this thing.
Hee yet goeth on further, and for more abundant
proofe, telleth vs, that <hi>Puteanus, the Generall of the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites,
who liued within twelue miles of Geneua, had by
writing related</hi> this newes, <hi>adding moreouer, that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
was one of those Fathers, whom the Pope had appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to goe</hi> and instruct the Citizens of Geneua. Yea,
and moreouer, saith the Relator, the <hi>Landgraue of Hes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen,
being scared with this newes, sent messengers to Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neua,
who after their returne confirmed all this to be true.</hi>
This they reported of <hi>Beza;</hi> without either fear of God
or reuerence of men. For all this while <hi>Beza</hi> was aliue;
and continued preaching and writing against the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitions
and idolatries of the Romane Church, for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
yeeres after. And for the clearer detection of this
shamelesse lye, he wrote a Booke, the title whereof is
<hi>Beza rediuiuus, Beza returned to life againe:</hi> Wherein
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:12745:43"/>
he hath laid open the Iesuites forgeries, to the shame
of their Order. I could bring more instances of their
abominable forgeries of this kinde, but I am afraide to
cloy the Reader with such vnsauoury fictions. Yet two
examples there are, (both within mine owne know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and experience) which I cannot omit, without
some short rehearsall. The one is, of the famous Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine,
Doctor <hi>Rainolds, President</hi> of <hi>Corpus Christi</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in <hi>Oxford:</hi> and the other, of the worthy <hi>Prelate</hi>
Doctor <hi>King, Bishop</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> my euer-honoured
Lord. Of the former, some well-willers to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane-Church,
were discouered to haue diuulged re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports,
in the time of his long sicknesse, (for hee died
of a lingring consumption) that hee voyded his owne
Ordure vpward by the mouth: (of which lye what
construction ill mindes would frame, any man may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
conceiue.) This report was brought to him while
he was yet aliue, which made him to send for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
who was said to be the <hi>author,</hi> or at least a <hi>reporter</hi>
of this forgerie, and shewed him what the matter was,
that hee vsed to spit out of his mouth, euen the very
same that other such sicke men vse to doe. But these
lyers might haue proceeded perhaps to fowler ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
had they not beene preuented by the timely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence
of some learned, and his louing and religious
friends. For they remembring and considering the
shamelesse practices of Papists, in scattering false newes
to disgrace the Worthies of our Church, came to him
the day before his death, put him in minde of their
false dealing, and desired him, that for the preuenting
of such slanders after his death, hee would now make
an open confession of his faith, and constant beliefe.
Which he being not able to doe with his owne mouth,
his speech hauing fayled him some dayes before, left
the composing of a forme of Confession to them, to
which hee would subscribe. And they considering his
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:12745:43"/>
weakenesse, framed it in generall and few words, in
this manner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>These are to witnesse vnto all the world, that now in
this my weakenesse, wherein I looke for my dissolution,
and hope shortly to be with my Christ, I die in a constant
beliefe, perswasion, and profession of that holy truth of
God, in defence whereof I haue stood both by writing
and speaking, against the Church of Rome, and what so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
other Enemies of Gods truth. And for mine owne
resolution touching mine owne state of Saluation after
this life, I assure my selfe thereof, by the merits of Christ
Iesus onely, into whose hands I commend my spirit, as
vnto my faithfull Redeemer.</p>
               <p>To this he readily subscribed with his owne hand;</p>
               <p>Iohn Rainolds.</p>
               <p>And his friends then present, who had beene eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witnesses

and Patrone: for want, I say, of some such prouidence
afore-hand, this glorious Soule hath beene traduced by
worthlesse pennes, and foule-mouthed fiends (the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignitie
of the thing maketh mee, against my nature
and custome, to giue them that name whereof they
are most worthy) as if hee had made defection to the
Roman Church; to whose errours notwithstanding he
shewed himselfe an Enemy to his dying-day: as those
that knew him inwardly, doe know very well, how
in the very time of his sicknesse, hee spared not vpon
occasion to expresse his zeale that way. But of all
foule-mouthes, that haue slandered that blessed Soule,
hee that wrote the <hi>Bishop of Londons Legacie,</hi> is the
most shamelesse and impudent lier. The Author of the
<hi>Protestants plea</hi> is but a milke-sop to this noble Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion:
and Father <hi>Persons</hi> himselfe must now be forced
to resigne vp to him the <hi>Whetstone,</hi> which his secular
Brethren bestowed vpon him for his excellency in the
<hi>fittening Trade.</hi> For they and other of their fellowes,
haue played their prizes well:<note place="margin">

Booke, qualifying, or rather destroying in the
latter, some transparent lyes, which with an Whores
forehead, and without regard of the Worlds censure,
hee had auerred in the former. For, in the yeere
1622. when hee first diuulged this Libell, he made the
worthy <hi>Bishop</hi> to speake those silly Motiues, which his
worthlesse selfe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ad deuised. And so hee went masked
vnder the <hi>Bishops</hi> name: but with such difformitie
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:12745:44"/>
and disproportion euery way, as made mee remember
the Asse in the Fable; which presuming to weare the
Lyons skinne, did by his long eares bewray himselfe
to be an Asse notwithstanding. He saith, that the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi>
himselfe did penne those Motiues, and deliuered
them to this <hi>Publisher,</hi> this publique Lyer, to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the Presse. I would the world were worthy
to vnderstand what rare man this is, that had such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
acquaintance with that learned and wise <hi>Bishop,</hi>
as to heare from him the secrets of his heart, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
from him the studied Reasons of his Conuersion,
which were neuer made knowne to any bodie else.
And sure, it were a great honour to see that face, that
could come and goe, and conuerse with the <hi>Bishop</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
these weightie affaires, and in this serious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
without being once seene of any other man; as if
by the vertue of some <hi>Gyges</hi> his Ring, he had bin trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
into an inuisible Spirit. But he goeth on, and
saith that the man is knowne that reconciled the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi>
to the Romane Church. But it is to be feared, he
will neuer make knowne the mans name to the world,
lest if the <hi>Reconciler</hi> should proue more shamefaste, then
this <hi>Publisher</hi> is, hee might returne the lye vpon the
Author that deuised it, and spit his shame in his owne
face. And yet say, hee both can and will name the
man, what great mastery is in this? or what great cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
might such a circumstance, comming from an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiuocator,
gaine to his cause? For did not <hi>Puteanus</hi>
the Prouinciall of the Iaesuites, name the man that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
<hi>Beza</hi> to their Church? Yes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He said expresse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
(not with <hi>Ifs</hi> and <hi>Ands,</hi> as this <hi>Publisher</hi> doth)
that the man was the Bishop of <hi>Geneua.</hi> And did hee
not name beside, both the man that was sent to cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chize
the Citizens of <hi>Geneua</hi> in the Romane Faith;
and the man that sent messengers to enquire of this
news in <hi>Geneua,</hi> &amp; found it to be true? Yes. For, for the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:12745:45"/>
one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he nameth himselfe, who among others, was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>Geneua</hi> to instruct them. And for the other, hee
nameth the Lantgraue of <hi>Hessen,</hi> who was a Prince
not farre off, and knew the vndoubted truth of this
newes. Iesuites and Equiuocators are ashamed of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
And yet, I would we might be so much behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to this <hi>Publisher,</hi> as to publish the <hi>Reconcilers</hi>
name, that performed so great a worke for this great
man. To this purpose this publike Lyer spake in the
first publication of his Booke; which not long after
was suppressed and kept from the view of the world. I
suppose, some of his Superiours more wary then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
being ashamed of such <hi>shining lyes,</hi> did call in the
Booke, till some kinde of qualification might temper
those shamelesse and hideons vntruths. And then in
the yeere following 1623. hee made a new publicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the same worthy Worke, changing onely the
Title-leafe, and the Preface to the Reader. And in this
second publication, hee is contented to owne his owne
abortiue Brat, which in the former hee had without
shame fathered vpon the worthy Bishop: and <hi>wisheth
that himselfe may be taken to haue written those motiues, as
a precedent or patterne warranting any Protestant in the
change of his Religion, though by a Poeticall freedome pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly
applyed to the Bishop.</hi> And whereas through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the whole Booke, hee maketh the <hi>Bishop</hi> speake
what himselfe had forged; hee now giueth his Reader
leaue <hi>with his full consent and allowance, to suppose all
these passages to be</hi> fictiones personarum, <hi>and warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the figure</hi> Prosopopeia, that is, a fiction of the
Person. It were some signe of grace, if he had acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
the whole <hi>fiction,</hi> as hee doth this part of it. But
he goeth on still: and euen in the new altered Preface,
or Aduertisement to the Reader, hee accuseth the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi>
of defection from his Religion; and by a figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue

affirme, that the</hi> Bishop <hi>did write and deliuer to others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Reasons or Motiues of his change in Religion.</hi> In
which speech, this Slanderer would haue his Reader to
vnderstand that, which himselfe dareth not speake;
that when it shall appeare to be a shamelesse forgery,
hee may wipe his mouth with the Whore in the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbes,</hi>
and say, that hee said it not. But, <hi>foule-mouth,</hi>
if thou hast any thing to say, spit out: and labour to
giue some satisfaction to the World, to auoid the eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of <hi>coozening the liuing,</hi> and <hi>slandering the dead.</hi>
For know, that the World already is possessed with
this opinion, that thou must needes be some ignorant
Iesuite<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (for none else can be imagined to be so Bayard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bold.) And if now thou forbeare to produce some
proofe, or some probabilitie, or some possibility,
how these things might be; wee shall resolue vpon it,
that <hi>Persons</hi> his <hi>ghost</hi> is risen from the dead, and hath
brought with him <hi>seuen other spirits worse</hi> and more ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then himselfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that that is the reason, why
such vast and shamelesse Forgeries doe shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
in this man. But I leaue this Lyer for this time:
and humbly pray the <hi>Worthies</hi> of our Church, that they
would take these things into their consideration: and
as men that deale with Thornes, doe fence their hands
with thicke Gloues; so seeing they doe liue, and must
die in the middest of such slanderous Tongues, they
would arme themselues against such malice, by an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
profession of their Faith, at such times especially
as they are ready to leaue the World; lest they may
be slandered after their deaths, when they will want
libertie to defend themselues. But heere I stay my
course. For I perceiue I haue in part digressed alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
and yet not so, as that I am gone from the matter
in hand. For I was saying, that Equiuocation did
serue the Masters of it for this turne among others;
that by it they might without scruple of cons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lence,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:12745:46"/>
defame and belye the <hi>Worthies</hi> of our Church, that so
they might gaine the more credit to their owne. Now
how they vse to defame our learned men, I haue decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
fully by this digression, if the Reader will so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme
it: and what vse Equiuocation may stand them
in this practice, will not be hard for any man to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue.
For a wonder it might seeme, that men of any
religion or conscience, should endure themselues,
while they broach such broad-faced lyes. But the Arte
of Equiuocation will presently remoue all such scruple
or grudge. For it teacheth how to speake all vntruths,
without telling of the least lye: and so the Equiuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
needeth not to haue any scruple in that respect.
And this doubt being once remoued, there can be no
further let to hinder their proceeding. For, what
though the Heretiques complaine of wrong and iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
done to them in their good name? that skilleth
not. For, <hi>in ordine ad Deum,</hi> and <hi>pro bono Societatis,</hi>
that is lawfull enough, or rather very meritorious. For

disgraced, because hee was against their Societie.</hi> Where
the Author or Authors of that Booke adde further,
that the Iesuites hold such <hi>deuillish Principles, whereby
they may at pleasure defame whom they please.</hi> And if
they take such libertie of Conscience against their own
Catholique Brethren; they will out of question make
no bones to slander and disgrace an Heretique. This
then is one turne among the rest, and it is a speciall one
and of great vse for their purpose, that by this Arte of

proofe of their heresie; which our Iesuites doe for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of their opinion. And they had better shew
of reason then these men haue; for diuers of those In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
were either direct and culpable vntruthes, or
seemed at least to border too neere vpon such obliquity:
but as for this new found <hi>Equiuocation</hi> by mentall <hi>reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,</hi>
it hath no shew nor semblance of probability, to
be gathered from them. 2. That neither S. <hi>Augustin,</hi>
who most diligently confuted those Heretikes, nor any
other ancient Writer, for answering of these obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
did euer flee to this Arte of <hi>Equiuocation;</hi> or once
say, that those Fathers and holy men did not lye in any
of those speeches, for that they spoke the truth by a <hi>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall</hi>
reseruation. Which answere, if it had bin true, had
beene most pertinent and easie; as our late, <hi>Equiuocators</hi>
doe not only confesse, but bragge of it too. For<note n="a" place="margin">Comm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

way,</hi> he acknowledgeth that it was not knowne to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>.
<hi>Augustin,</hi> or those other Worthies, who in former
times did beate downe these Errours of the Heretikes.
And when he saith, that this way ariseth out of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
he intimateth, that if the Fathers had knowne
this, they might easily haue answered the <hi>Priscillianists,</hi>
by interpreting those Texts after his <hi>new way.</hi> Now
from hence it followeth, that the Ancients did not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
these passages of Scripture, as making any
thing for <hi>Equiuocation.</hi> And therefore, when <hi>Equiuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cators</hi>
alledge S. <hi>Augustin,</hi> and some others of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
for their interpretation, they abuse both their
Readers, and the ancient Fathers.</p>
               <p>These things being first noted, I come to giue a more
direct answere to the obiections; and it is this; As they
affirme, so I deny, that these or any of these sayings al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:12745:48"/>
were meant, or are to bee vnderstood and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strued
with any <hi>Equiuocall reseruation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yes, say they, that they are. For if they bee not so
construed, they are <hi>apparent lyes,</hi> which may not be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
of those holy men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. If they be not vnderstood and made true
by <hi>mentall reseruation,</hi> they are <hi>apparent Lyes,</hi> say they.
If this doe not follow, then our <hi>Equiuocators</hi> doe great
wrong to those ancient Worthies. And plaine it is,
for diuers of them, that they doe so. For when <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
said of <hi>Sarah, She is my Sister;</hi> and when <hi>Moses</hi>
said to <hi>Pharaoh, We must goe three dayes &amp;c.</hi> and when
<hi>Samuel</hi> said to the Elders of <hi>Bethleem, I am come to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
vnto the Lord—;</hi> and when <hi>Ieremie</hi> said, <hi>I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
my supplication &amp;c.</hi> these speeches were all of
them true, in the words as they lye, and according to
the common acception and meaning of them. And
therefore there is in them no <hi>Iesuiticall Equiuocation,</hi> in
which the words are false, till a secret thought doth
make them true. And in this sence, and to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
<hi>Abraham</hi> doth interpret his owne meaning, and
explaine his words. For when <hi>Abimelech</hi> challenged
him for concealing his wife, and asked, <hi>What sawest
thou, that thou hast done this thing?</hi> he answered for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,<note place="margin">Gen. 20. 11, 12.</note>
                  <hi>Because I thought, Surely, the feare of God is not its
this place, &amp;c. and yet indeed she is my Sister; she is the
daughter of my Father, but not the daughter of my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
In which answere we may note three things. 1.
He sheweth the reason which moued him to conceale
her to be his wife; <hi>Because I thought the feare of God,
&amp;c.</hi> 2 He defendeth his speech to be true as the words
doe sound; <hi>and yet indeed she is my Sister. q. d.</hi> That which
I said is very true. And hereby it appeareth, that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
did not equiuocate; because <hi>Abrahams</hi> words in
their vsuall signification, and as they were vttered by
him, were true: but the words of an Equiuocator, as
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:12745:49"/>
they are vttered, are false, till an inward <hi>reseruation</hi> do
patch them vp, and make a truth of them. And it fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hereby appeareth also, that F. <hi>Persons</hi> did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
belye <hi>Abraham,</hi> but Almighty God himselfe, when
he saith, that<note n="a" place="margin">Apologie for Eccles. Subo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  <hi>both Abraham and Sarah said, that shee
was not his Wife, but his Sister:</hi> and that this was one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<hi>diuers sayings and speeches in Scripture allowed by
the Holy Ghost.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Abraham</hi> explaineth his
words, or rather sheweth how they were true and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faigned,
and that is, because she<note n="b" place="margin">So S. Aug. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreteth this place, lib. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra mendac. cap. 10.</note> was his neere kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman
on the Fathers side, and such women in the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall
language of those Countries, were called their <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.
Abraham</hi> then sheweth that his speech was true,
because the thing was so, as his words did sound; and
not because he had some secret <hi>reseruation</hi> in his minde,
by additio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wherof they became true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And this sheweth
againe, that in these words of <hi>Abraham,</hi> there was no
<hi>Equiuocation,</hi> such as our new Doctros doe imagine.
And <hi>Abrahams</hi> example in interpreting his owne
words, may serue vs for a patterne to interpret the rest
by. And so; as he said, <hi>Indeed she is my Sister,</hi> as I said:
so we may say of them, <hi>Indeed,</hi> and intruth the things
were so, as they said. Only in these examples, though
all that was said, was true: yet something that was
true, was concealed; which we grant to bee lawfull:
nor doth it any way helpe the Iesuites, or fauour their
imaginary fiction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 2. When they say, If the speeches be not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
with <hi>mentall reseruation,</hi> then those men told
a <hi>Lye:</hi> I answere, that that may be granted of some of
them, without any absurdity, or wrong of those
worthy men. For if we be forced to confesse, that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi>
did commit murder, why should we bee afrayd to
confesse that he told a <hi>Lye,</hi> if he vttered any such words
as had not a true meaning, as our <hi>Equiuocators</hi> say that
he did? And if we grant it in <hi>Dauid,</hi> what harme is
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:12745:49"/>
there, to acknowledge it in others of Gods best ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants,
if by the Text and their owne speeches, any such
thing doe appeare? If then any of these holy men did
speake words which were vntrue, wee may without
inconuenience grant, that as they did sinne in other
things, so they might in this: and therefore herein we
must not take example by them, to doe as they haue
done before vs. This answere S. <hi>Augustin</hi> maketh to
the <hi>Priscillianists,</hi> when they alledged the example of
ancient men and women, to prooue that <hi>Lying</hi> was
lawfull. For<note n="a" place="margin">Haec quando in Scripturis sancti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

anger, that wee perish not?</hi> And when God had threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<hi>Ezekiah, Set thine house, &amp;c.</hi> yet <hi>Ezekiah</hi>

                  <hi>turned
his face to the wall, and prayed to the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> Where
his prayer for freedome, sheweth that hee vnderstood
not Gods threatning to be meant without exception.
And thus the people of God haue euer beene wont to
vnderstand such like speeches, till our late Doctors of
<hi>Rome</hi> haue made God to be an <hi>Equiuocator,</hi> that they
might alledge him for a patrone of their sinne.</p>
               <p>The third head of Arguments, containeth the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of our blessed Sauiour; who though hee were the
<hi>Truth</hi> it selfe, and that there was neuer any <hi>guile found
in his mouth,</hi> yet these men will needes draw him in, to
be a fauourer and ring-leader of their falshoods and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truthes.
And so did their Predecessors, the <hi>Priscillia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists</hi>
doe before them. For they (as<note n="c" place="margin">Contra Me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dac. cap. 2. pag. 14. A.</note> Saint <hi>Augustine</hi>
saith of them) for defence of their Doctrine of lying,
<hi>brought testimonies out of Scriptures,</hi> and <hi>encouraged
their Schollers by the examples of Patriarchs, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
and Apostles, and Angels,</hi> non dubitantes adde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
etiam ipsum Dominum Christum, <hi>making no scruple
to adioyne also our Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> as a patterne of
their lyes. And right so for all the world, doe our <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiuocators</hi>
deale now-a-dayes. They bring examples
of Patriarchs, and Prophets, and Apostles, and blessed
Angels, not fearing to draw in God himselfe, and Iesus
Christ his blessed Sonne, to be Abettors of their frauds.</p>
               <p>But of God wee haue heard what they say already:
let vs now heare what they say of Iesus Christ: and
how, and when, and wherein hee vsed this Arte of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiuocation.
Yes, say they, he did equiuocate, when
being with two of his Disciples,<note n="d" place="margin">Luk. 24. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>hee made as though
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:12745:51"/>
hee would goe further:</hi> and when speaking of the day
of Iudgement, he said,<note n="a" place="margin">Mar. 13. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> 
                  <hi>But of that day and that houre
knoweth no man—, nor the Son, but the Father onely:</hi> and
when hee said to his Brethren,<note n="b" place="margin">Ioh. 7. 8. Persons Mitig. c. 7. num. 29. pag. 293.</note> 
                  <hi>Ego non ascendam,
&amp;c. I will not goe vp to Ierusalem to this Feast,</hi> and yet
hee meant to goe vp, and so went; and diuers other
times.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Neither in these, nor in any other place, was
our Lord, the <hi>spotlesse Lambe of God,</hi> euer found to <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiuocate,</hi>
according to the rules of this new Arte.</p>
               <p>Not in the first place, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 28. For first, there
our Lord is said to doe something; <hi>hee made as though
hee would goe further:</hi> but he is not said there to haue
said any thing in which this supposed <hi>reseruation</hi> might
be vnderstood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> Yes, but deedes also may signifie as well as
words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Deedes sometimes are equiualent to words,
and doe signifie as well as words doe: and that is,
when as words, so they doe declare our meaning, <hi>ex
instituto,</hi> or by some kinde of compact and agreement
among men. And that may be done two wayes. First,
expressely, when some words ioyned with the deedes,
doe declare that to be the meaning and purpose of him
that vseth them. As when <hi>Iudas</hi> kissed his Master:
this signified that hee was Iesus, whom they came to
apprehend, because before hee had giuen them this
signe,<note n="c" place="margin">Matt. 26. 48.</note> 
                  <hi>Whomsoeuer I shall kisse, that same is hee.</hi> And
when Iesus gaue a sop to <hi>Iudas,</hi> that signified that hee
was the Traitor, because hee had told them before,
<note n="d" place="margin">Ioh. 13. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>Hee it is, to whom I shall giue a sop, when I haue dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
it.</hi> And so, when an oath is ministred or tendred
vnto vs, if wee lay the hand vpon the Booke, and kisse
it, this signifieth that wee consent to the taking of the
Oath, because that is appointed and required for this
purpose. Secondly, deedes may bee equiualent to
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:12745:52"/>
words, when by some outward circumstances wee doe
declare, that we intend them as signes of our meaning,
and doe referre and vse them to that purpose. In this
kinde, wee may see a man, who is borne deafe and
dumbe, to talke and conferre with his neighbours.
And in this kinde <hi>a shrugge of the shoulder,</hi> (if as <hi>Persons</hi>
saith, it be so meant and taken in Italie) may be a signe,
and haue the signification of a Negation or deniall.
And when a man openeth his mouth, and sheweth a
defect in his tongue, and maketh a gabbling noyse and
vndistinct sound, this is a signifying deede, and doth
import that that man is dumbe. In either of these
kindes, deedes and gestures are equiualent to words,
and may containe truth or falshood in them, as well as
words doe. But else, deedes and gestures, if in some
such manner, <hi>ex instituto,</hi> by appointment and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
among men,<note n="a" place="margin">Facta nihil huc auin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

for signification of our minde, though they may
carry shew, and men may gather some meaning from
them, yet they are not equiualent to words; neither
is there any lye contained in it, though the shew be not
answerable to the thing. And such a deede as this, was
that of our Sauiour, when hee shewed by his gesture, a
purpose of going further: and therefore this needeth
no <hi>reseruation</hi> to make it true; seeing without any <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation</hi>
it hath no false or lying signification, such as
words haue. And thus <hi>Lucas Brugensis,</hi> a learned Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine

                     </gap>o more shew
of a lye in this fact of Christ,</hi> then <hi>when before he seemed to
be a stranger or a way-faring man.</hi> And he giueth his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
why hee thinketh there is no vntruth in this deed
and gesture,<note n="c" place="margin">Magaum dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimen est inter voba &amp; opera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>for there is a great difference betweene
words and deedes. For words by their first institution haue
the power or vse of signifying; but so haue not deedes.</hi> And
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:12745:52"/>
hence he inferreth that deedes, actions, and gestures,
though oftentimes they be, yet they are not alwaies
signes either of some ensuing action to follow, or of
our present purpose and meaning; nor haue they the
nature of a lye in them, <hi>etiamsi ad decipiendum aliquan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
siunt, though they be sometimes done, to deceiue the</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
of the beholder, and to make him beleeue
that which is not true. So that if our Lord did make
shew of <hi>going further,</hi> and intended it not, as Father
<hi>Persons</hi> saith; yet in this learned mans iudgement,
there was no <hi>lye</hi> in it: and consequently there nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
no <hi>mentall reseruation</hi> to saue it from being a
lye.</p>
               <p>Secondly, and more agreeably to our Sauiours mind,
wee may answere and say, that our Lord made as if he
would goe further: yea, and meant it too, if their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties
and importunitie had not stayed him. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Text saith, <hi>They constrained him;</hi> that is, they
importuned him to stay; and he, ouercome by their
intreatie, stayed with them. The clearer meaning of
which words, we may the better conceiue and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
by a like speech, <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 53. For there it is said,
The <hi>Samaritans receiued him not, because his face was
as though hee would goe to Ierusalem;</hi> that is, by his
behauiour it seemed that hee meant to goe thither:
and so hee did meane it indeed. And so in this place,
when it is said, that <hi>hee made as though hee would goe
fur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>r;</hi> the meaning is, that hee tooke his leaue, and
bad them farewell, or vsed some other such like be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour,
which made it seeme, that hee meant to goe
further. Yea, and so hee meant indeede, sauing that at
their request hee was contented to abide with them.
And thus <hi>Barradius,</hi> and <hi>Ribera,</hi> two famous Iesuites,
doe interpret this place. Wee may answere saith the
one of them,<note n="a" place="margin">Barrad. to. 4. l. 8. c. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

from that false glosse that <hi>Persons</hi> putteth vpon it; and
doe free our Lord Iesus from that slanderous imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which the Iesuite doth lay vpon him, when<note n="c" place="margin">Mitig. cap. 9. nu. 58. pa. 386.</note> he

                  <hi>The second place mentioned, and produced for E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiuocation,
is that speech of our Sauiour,</hi> Mar. 13.
Of that day, and that houre, &amp;c. This pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>position <hi>(saith</hi>
                  <note n="e" place="margin">Mitig ca. 9. nu. 45. pa. 378.</note> Persons) had some reseruation of mind, for that otherwise
it had beene false.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Not so<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nay this inference of the Iesuite is
false and foolish too: for our Sauiour, according to
his wonted manner elsewhere, speaketh of himselfe,
as he was reputed and knowne to be, that is, as he was
man. And in that sense, the words haue an vsuall and
cleare construction and signification; which is, that as
he was man, he knew not of that day. This inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
(as<note n="f" place="margin">Mitig. cap. 9. num 48.</note> 
                  <hi>Persons</hi> doth acknowledge) is giuen
by ancient Fathers in great number. Nor is this a
<hi>mentall reseruation,</hi> as <hi>Persons</hi> would haue his ignorant
Reader to beleeue: but an interpretation vsually meant
and vnderstood by Christians, in these and such like
speeches as these. And therefore our Sauiour in this se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
did not keepe one <hi>secret sence</hi> to himselfe in his
inward minde, and signifie another to his Disciples in
the words vttered.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:12745:53"/>
But if it be an Equiuocation, such as they fancy,
what then shall the reseruation be? <hi>Persons,</hi> knowing
that no man before the late inuention of this <hi>new Art,</hi>
did euer thinke of secret <hi>reseruations,</hi> or mentall ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations
in our Sauiours words; calleth euery Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
that any good Author giueth, by the name of <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation,</hi>
and reckoneth that Author, for a fauourer of
his, like the mad man in <hi>Athenaeus,</hi> who when any
ship came to the Haue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, put it in his Tables as one of his
owne.<note place="margin">I. c. nu. 49.</note> But that which carrieth most shew of a <hi>reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,</hi>
is this; <hi>The Sonne doth not know</hi> the day of
iudgement, meaning that hee knew it not so, as hee
would discouer it vnto them. For this explicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
by Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> and other Fathers, saith <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;</hi>
and hee addeth, (as triumphing in so plaine a
proofe) that this exposition <hi>expresseth the very same re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation</hi>
in <hi>Christs words,</hi> which they talke of in their
<hi>mixt and equiuocall</hi> propositions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> To this I answere two things: First, That
the Exposition giuen by those Fathers, doth not imply
any <hi>equiuocall</hi> reseruation. Secondly, That it doth
not giue the true sence or meaning of the place.</p>
               <p>First, It containeth not any Iesuiticall <hi>reseruation.</hi>
For those Fathers which giue that interpretation, <hi>The
Sonne knoweth not;</hi> that is, <hi>not to make you know it:</hi> or
rather, <hi>the Sonne knoweth it not;</hi> that is, <hi>hee doth not
make you to know it;</hi> doe fetch and gather this exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
not from any secret conceit reserued in our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
minde, but from the vse and acception and signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of the word, as it is vsed in Scripture. For
so, say they, this word, <hi>scio</hi> or <hi>noui,</hi> is often vsed. As
when God said to <hi>Abraham,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 22. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>Now I know that thou

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:12745:54"/>
frequent, as they say, in Scriptures; they thinke they
may be the like reason, keeping the same proportion

learned Bishop who wrote against <hi>Eudaemon-Ioannes.</hi>
Now this interpretation of the word, being drawne
from the vsuall acception of it in Scripture, is nothing
at all to the Iesuites purpose, who fancieth a <hi>secret</hi>
clause kept in the minde, but no way included in the
vse of the word.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This interpretation, <hi>The Sonne knoweth
no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>;</hi> that is, <hi>hee doth not reueale or make it knowne to you,</hi>
as it maketh nothing for the Iesuites Equiuocation, so
it is not greatly to our Sauiours meaning. My reasons
are two. First, If that were the meaning, then it
would follow, that the Father did so know the day of
iudgement, as that hee did <hi>reueale</hi> it vnto them. For
that which this sentence doth deny of the Sonne, it
doth by vertue of the exceptiue particle adioyned, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
of the Father; <hi>No man, no nor the Sonne doth
know it, but the Father.</hi> Where, if wee fill vp the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
and make the sentence perfect, the whole
speech must be this; <hi>No man, nor Angell, neither the
Sonne, doth know it, but the Father hee doth know it.</hi> Now
in this speech take the word <hi>[know]</hi> in the sense of
those Fathers, <hi>hee knoweth;</hi> that is, <hi>hee maketh to know,</hi>
and then the sentence thus expounded, in plaine words
will be this, <hi>No man, nor the Angels, neither the Sonne,
doth make you to know the day of iudgement: but the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hee doth make you to know it.</hi> But this is not true
of the Father; and therefore that is not the true inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
or meaning of the word.</p>
               <p>My second reason is, Our Sauiour in these words,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:12745:54"/>
                  <hi>No man—knoweth;</hi> meant to shew how secret and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne
the day and houre of Gods iudgement was;
but take the word in this sence, <hi>hee knoweth not;</hi> that
is, <hi>hee reuealeth not, or doth not make you to know:</hi> and
then this sentence doth not imply or inferre or signifie
any secrecie of that day. For, if thousands knew it, yet
it might be said of them all, <hi>They know it not;</hi> that is,
<hi>they doe not reueale it, or make you to know it.</hi> And
consequently, this interpretation doth crosse our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
meaning, and ouerthrow that, for which hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
it. Now, lay these together, and then there is
lesse then nothing in our Sauiours speech for the Iesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites
purpose: both because the word cannot beare that
sense in this place, which onely might seeme to fauour
them; and because, that sense, as it was vnderstood
by the Fathers, was not meant to include any such <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation.</hi>
And so I haue done with this second place,
which is the one of the places, that Doctor <hi>Norrice</hi>
did defend his Equiuocation by.</p>
               <p>Onely, lest some Popish Cauiller, according to their
vsuall manner, should raise clamours after mee, that I
doe deny and gain-say the exposition of the Fathers:
let the Reader remember, that the other interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which I follow, is confessed by Father <hi>Persons</hi> to
be giuen by other Fathers in great number. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
if any shall quarrell with mee for leauing an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of some Fathers, where I haue so good reason
for it; let him know, that I can produce diuers of
their owne Writers, who doe reiect as great a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and perhaps vpon lesser reason.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The third testimony is from the words of
our Sauiour, <hi>Iohn</hi> 7. 8. which Father <hi>Persons</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Equiuocators recite thus, <hi>Ego non ascendam ad di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em
festu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> istum, I will not goe vp to Ierusalem to this Feast;</hi>
and yet (say they) he meant to go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> vp, and so he went.
And therefore here he had a secret <hi>reseruation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:12745:55"/>
                  <hi>Asw.</hi> They corrupt the Text two waies, 1 by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
the words. 2 by peruerting the sense.</p>
               <p>1. By altering the words. For the Originall Greeke
is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, <hi>I doe not yet goe vp.</hi> And their
authentick Latin, <hi>Ego non ascendo, I doe not goe vp.</hi> And
whereas some Copies had corruptly read it, <hi>non ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
I will not goe;</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Roman. Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect. Ioh. 7. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>Lucas Bragensis,</hi> lest any man might
afterward mistake, hath giuen admonition, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the <hi>Roman Correction</hi> of their Bible, set forth
by the Popes authority, they may not change <hi>ascendo</hi>
into <hi>ascendam.</hi> Yea, and their Rhemists reade it in
their English Translation, <hi>I goe not vp to this Festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall
day.</hi> Which was true in the very Letter, &amp; meant
by our Sauiour according to the expresse words. For
he did not meane then to goe vp, but afterward when
time serued. And yet our <hi>Equiuocators,</hi> to gaine some
shew from our Sauiours words, doe corrupt not onely
the Originall and truely authentic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Greeke, but their
owne Latine Text too. But it is no maruell: for such
a false Arte could neuer be vpheld by true dealing.</p>
               <p>2. By peruerting the sence. For say the words had
beene, <hi>I will not goe vp,</hi> as <hi>Persons</hi> and Doctor <hi>Norice,</hi>
and others would fame haue it: yet the circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the Text doe shew, that that could not be meant
of the whole time during the feast, or that hee would
not go vp at all; because it followeth in the next words
by way of reason, <hi>because my time is not yet acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plished,</hi> as
the Rhemists tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>slate it; or <hi>because my time is not yet ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
come,</hi> as it is more plainly in our Translation. Which
words doe plainely shew his meaning to be this, that
he would not then goe, when they would haue him:
but would goe when he saw his owne time. And this
he might both doe and meane, according to the plaine
sense of the words spoken. By which it may appeare,
that it is want of proofe, and weakenes of their cause,
that made them to drawe in this Text, which is so
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:12745:55"/>
cleere against them. And so, it is the very same reason
also, that forceth them <hi>(for necessity hath no law)</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the many other speeches of our Sauiour, which
haue as much affinitie with Popish <hi>Equiuocation,</hi> as
there is agreement betweene Christ and Belial, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
Christ and Antichrist: as I could easily shew,
if it were conuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to stand vpon all their friuolous &amp;
idle allegations. But I thinke it not worth the while,
either to tire the Reader, or to trouble my selfe with
such fond Cauils. Only for a generall answere to them
all, let this be remembred; that there is neuer a Text
produced by them for this purpose, but that learned ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positers,
both ancient and moderne, as well of their
Church, as of ours, do interpret and expound it in some
determinate sense, which they gather or obserue either
from the signification of the words, or the vse &amp; appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of them in the Scriptures, or from some circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
or considerations in the Text it selfe. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
such Texts, in the iudgement of all such Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
are not to be expounded or vnderstood of any <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
reseruations,</hi> kept secret in the Speakers minde. For
such <hi>reseruation</hi> as I shewed before, may be any that
themselues will fancie. Insomuch, that the Priests do
frame seuen seuerall and distinct reseruations, all alike
fit for Father <hi>Listers</hi> Equiuocation, when he deceiued
his Keeper; and doe intimate that they might haue
framed many moe, and all to as good purpose. And no
doubt, as they imagined those seuen, they might haue
inuented seuentie moe, that would haue serued the
turne. In all which it is not possible, for the Hearer or
Reader of such a speech, to imagine, what the Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<hi>reseruation</hi> is; it beeing not such as the significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the words, or any circumstances of the businesse
doe yeeld, but as the minde of the <hi>Equiuocator</hi> will
fancie within his deceitfull heart. Nor do they in their
<hi>Equiuocations</hi> meane, that the Hearer should know<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:12745:56"/>
their <hi>reseruations.</hi> For their intent is, to reserue one
sense in their owne breast, and to imprint another in
the Hearers minde. This only short note being obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
it will be easie for euery Christian, that will open
his eyes, to see that no place produced by them out of
the Bible, doth include their secret and hidden <hi>reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uations.</hi>
Or if any Equiuocator will cauill, or can say,
that there is any testimony of theirs, which may not
receiue satisfaction by this generall Rule, and is in his
opinion worth the standing vpon; let him produce it:
and I will promise him either a solution of his reason,
or a recantation of mine opinion. And thus much shal
serue to be said concerning the Grounds and Reasons
which Equiuocators doe build vpon.</p>
               <p>Now I proceede to set downe some few reasons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
this new-found Arte, and fond deuice of <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation.</hi>
And those for this time shall be these fiue.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Because this late doctrine of <hi>Equiuocation</hi> destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the true nature of <hi>Equiuocation,</hi> whose name it bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.</item>
                  <item>2. Because it maintaineth a practice of lying, vnder
a colour of Truth.</item>
                  <item>3. Because it disturbeth humane society, and hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
mutuall commerce.</item>
                  <item>4. Because it impeacheth God of folly, in making
his Lawes against Lying.</item>
                  <item>5. Because it freeth the Deuill from all iust imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of being a Lyer.</item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. The Iesuiticall doctrine of Equiuocation,
doth destroy the true nature of Equiuocation, which
hitherto hath beene receiued of all men, and now (for
ought I know) is not reiected of any. This I prooue
thus; <hi>Equiuocation,</hi> in the true nature thereof, is, when
<hi>a word or speech hath moe senses than one.</hi> This the word
doth import. For <hi>Aequiuocum,</hi> by the very notation
of the name, is <hi>vox aequi plura significans, a word indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:12745:56"/>
betokening moe things.</hi> And in some such manner
as this, doe Writers of all sorts explaine and describe
<hi>Equiuocation.</hi> But in this new-deuised <hi>Equiuocation,</hi>
there is no word, nor no sentence, or saying, that hath
moe significatious or senses than one. For in their <hi>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
equiuocall</hi> Proposition, which they fancie, neither
the words taken by themselues, nor the whole saying
and sentence intended by the speaker, haue any <hi>Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity</hi>
or doubtfulnes of signification, or any moe senses
then one; as I haue shewed<note n="a" place="margin">Cap. 1. p. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> before, out of the <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocators</hi>
own Rules. And hence I may inferre, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
their <hi>reserued</hi> Proposition, is not an <hi>Equiuocall</hi> and
<hi>double-sensed</hi> Proposition, as they call it without reason,
and consequently, that they doe not by <hi>Equiuocation</hi>
speake truth in one sense, and mis-leade the Hearer
with another sence: or else, if notwithstanding this,
that Proposition bee <hi>Equiuocall</hi> and <hi>double-sensed</hi> still,
then we must say, that there may bee an <hi>Equiuocation,</hi>
where there is but one single sense and meaning. And
that destroyeth the true nature of <hi>Equiuocation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To this reason, first their confession is, that</hi>
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Pers. mitig. cap. 8. num. 8.</note> verball
Equiuocation, which is, when a word or speech signifieth
diuers things equally,<note n="c" place="margin">Pers. ibid. num. 15.</note> indeed is onely true and proper E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiuocation,
and agreeth onely to the Defiuition of Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation,
deliuered not onely by Philosophers, but Orators
also: and that<note n="d" place="margin">Pers. ibid. num 8.</note> it is properly called Equiuocation, when
a speech or word signifieth diuers things equally, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the proper nature of Equiuocation: and,<note n="e" place="margin">ibid. num. 15</note> that mentall
Equiuocation in rigor is none.</p>
               <p>2. Their answere is notwithstanding, that their
mixt Proposition may be<note n="f" place="margin">Pers. mitig. cap. 8. num. 10. pag. 313.</note> 
                  <hi>called Eq<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>uocation, in a more
large and ample signification, as Equiuocall may signifie an
amphibologicall, doubtfull or double-sensed Proposition, in
respect of the Speaker and Hearer, whereof the one vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth
the same in one sense, and the other in another. And
the cause why it is so called, is rather by a certaine simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:12745:57"/>
then propriety of speech: to wit, that euen as Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation
properly by communitie of name in things of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
natures, by variety of significations in the selfe-same
words or speech, by custome of phrase and composition of
sundry sorts, doth make different and doubtfull senses and
meaning to the Hearer: so in this case, by mentall reserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of some part of the foresaid mixt Proposition, the like
effect of doubtfulnes is bred in the Hearers vnderstanding.</hi>
For more ready vnderstanding of which perplexed
speech, I note that there are three things said by this
doubling <hi>Equiuocator.</hi> 1. That it is onely <hi>true and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Equiuocation,</hi> &amp; such as is comprised in the <hi>Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
giuen both by <hi>Philosophers</hi> &amp; <hi>Orators,</hi> when there
are diuers senses and significations in the words. 2.
That <hi>Equiuocation</hi> as they meane it in this question,
hath no such propertie in it, nor is comprised in the
<hi>Definition,</hi> that <hi>Philosophers and Orators</hi> haue described
<hi>Equiuocation</hi> by. 3. That notwithstanding all this, yet
it may rightly be called <hi>Equiuocation,</hi> because as true <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiuocation</hi>
breedeth diuers senses to the Hearer, by the
Ambiguity that is in the words; so this new-deuised E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiuocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
may breed diuers senses, one in the Hearer,
and another in the Speaker, by reason of the secret re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
that the Speaker imagineth in his own mind.
And this may seeme not so vnreasonable, because words
doe signifie <hi>ad placitum,</hi> and may be changed euery day.
And therefore it is no such fault, to frame a new mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and another signification in this word, then euer
any body did thinke of heretofore.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rep.</hi> This answere doth not weaken mine Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
it confirmeth and strengtheneth it rather. For
first, I doe not except so much against their new signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of the word, as against the new explication
and description of it. For they say, that they call it <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiuocall,</hi>
because it is a <hi>double-sensed</hi> Proposition; and
a <hi>double-sensed</hi> Proposition there fore they call it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:12745:57"/>
by it they signifie one sense to the Hearer, and i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine
another to themselues. But this doth vtterly
destroy the very essence &amp; entity of true <hi>Equiuocation.</hi>
For true <hi>Equiuocation</hi> cannot be conceiued to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a diuersitie of meanings in the speech: nor was it
euer heard of, that a Proposition could be <hi>double-sensed,</hi>
which had none but one single meaning: nor is it ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable
that that saying should be ambiguous, which
the Hearet can take or construe but one way.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Their change and alteration of the word,
to another different meaning, as it is by them here v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
doth conuince them of false and naughty dealing;
such as we may obserue Thieues to vse, when they haue
purloyned other mens goods. For Thieues (saith<note place="margin">Vt reliqui <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie)</hi>
when they <hi>haue taken away</hi> other mens goods, <hi>doe
change the markes of them,</hi> that it may not be knowne
whose they are, or to whom they belong. And right
so doe our Equiuocators deale in this case. For they
change the <hi>names, which are true markes</hi> of things; that
hereby they may conceile and hide the nature and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie
of the things themselues. I grant then, that
names may change with times; nor is it any fault to
alter the vse of a word, so there bee no wrong done to
the thing, by the misse-applying of the word: as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
it is no fault neither, to change the <hi>markes</hi> of
goods, when there is no fraud intended by it. But if
the markes of goods be changed, that the propertie of
them may be conceiled, that is a plaine tricke of thie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie.
And so, if names be changed, that the nature of
the things may be peruerted or obscured, that is a trick
of iugling, not inferior to that cousonage of the Thiefe.
And so it appeareth to be in this case. For this mungrill
Proposition of theirs, if it should be censured by Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers,
Orators, or other learned men, no man but
would iudge it at the first sight to be a lye: and so hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to all men haue euer called such speeches. But now
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:12745:58"/>
our new Artificers haue found another name for their
new Arte: they call it, Equiuocation. And this they
doe for a colourable shew, that it may be thought that
there is no vntruth, but onely an Ambiguity in the
speech: and that they in deceiuing men by <hi>mentall
reseruations,</hi> doe nothing but what honest men are
wont to doe, when they vtter sentences, that may haue
diuers meanings. Thus, while they change the names,
they doe also confound the things, and destroy their
true nature, which wise men, and <hi>Aristotle</hi> among the
rest, haue euer acknowledged to agree vnto them.</p>
               <p>Obiect. <hi>Nay, saith Father</hi>

by him in his Elenchs, then he erred grossely in making an
insufficient Diuision, which comprehendeth not all the parts
of the thing deuided. For if the said mixt Proposition <hi>(saith
he)</hi> be an Equiuocation, <hi>(as Iesuites say it is, in spite of
all reason, and against the doctrine of all ages)</hi> then must
it haue place among some of these three kindes; or else the
Diuision should be insufficient.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rep.</hi> A ridiculous conce it: whereto I know no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
that may be paralell; but I will imagine one as
neere as I can. Suppose then, a Father deuideth his
Lands among his owne Children, and a Conie catcher
there by steppeth in, and layeth claime to a share a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them: and when the matter commeth to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated,
in the Court, the Iudge parteth the Lands a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Brethren, to whom onely they belonged,
and shutteth out the Conie-catcher for a wrangler,
that layeth claime where he hath no right. What if in
this case, the Conie-catcher should complaine of the
Iudge, for partiall dealing, and reason against him, as
<hi>Persons</hi> doth against <hi>Aristotle,</hi> that <hi>if this Conie-catcher
haue a right, and a share in those Lands,</hi> as himselfe saith

And such a ridiculous wrangler, is Father <hi>Persons,</hi> who

a practice of lying, because hee whom they call an
Equiuocator, is in truth a Lyer, and that which they
call an Equiuocall Proposition, is a lying assertion. I
proue it thus. He that speaketh to another that which
himselfe knoweth to be false, is a Lyer, and a lye it is,
whensoeuer there is<note n="a" place="margin">Aug. conta mendac. c. 12.</note>

                  <hi>Hee that speaketh otherwise
then himselfe thinketh, doth deceiue another, and intendeth
to deceiue him. For he would not so speake, but that thereby
he may engender a contrarie opinion in another mans mind:
and this is to deceiue.</hi> Thus the Iesuite describeth a Lye,
and that agreeably to the receiued Doctrine of the
Schooles. But this which is said to containe the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of a Lye, is all of it found in the new-deuised <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocall</hi>
Proposition. For first, that which the Equiuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator
vttereth, is false, and so he knoweth it to be: for
<note n="e" place="margin">Pers. mitig. c. 12. num. 2. pag. 484. &amp; cap. 10. num. 22. p. 424.</note>

                     </gap>t of the words onely, or
vnderstanding of the Hearer.</hi> And the case is cleere, that
the words vttered by the Equinocator, containe an
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:12745:59"/>
vntruth and a falshood: for else they could not serue
him for <hi>euasion.</hi> But the words vttered are all that the
Equiuocator speaketh: and therefore that which hee
speaketh, is <hi>verbum falsum, a false word or speech.</hi> And
secondly, that he vttereth this falshood <hi>with minde and
purpose to deceiue</hi> the Hearer, in the sence that <hi>Tolet</hi>
here explaineth it, I haue<note n="a" place="margin">Cap. 1. pag. 16. num. 6.</note> shewed and proued out
of their owne writings: nor can it stand with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
sence, to conceiue it otherwise. And hence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
that the Equiuocator is a plaine lyer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Their answere is, that though the words con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
by themselues, and as they are vnderstood by
the Hearer, be false: yet as they are meant by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiuocator,
and as they are ioyned with the <hi>reseruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
kept in his minde, they are true. The summe is,
they are false of themselues, but they are made true
by the imagined <hi>reseruation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Re.</hi> This is a weak answer, &amp; an impertinent shift;
because their <hi>mentall reseruation</hi> hath nothing to doe
either with Truth or Lying; as may appeare by this
reason. Truth as it is heere meant, and Lying which
is the contrary to it, are morall acts contained in the
second Table of the Decalogue or Tenne Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
and therefore doe include a respect to our
Neighbours, nor can they be vnderstood without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
and relation vnto other men: so that lying con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth
in a signification of falshood vnto others, and
truth in signifying or vttering of that which is true;
and without such signification, either performed by
outward signes, or meant and intended to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
if occasion should be offered, Lying and Truth
morally taken, can haue no place. Vpon this ground,
which hath cleare euidence in it, <hi>Bannes</hi> a learned

that there may be a lye, where there is no <hi>purpose to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue.</hi>

                  <hi>I thinke</hi> (saith he <hi>that a minde to deceiue, is so
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:12745:59"/>
necessary in a lye, as that without it, a lye cannot exist.</hi>
This hee declareth thus: <hi>If Peter, no man being within
hearing, should vtter a speech, which hee knoweth to be
false, yet hee should not lye, though hee should speake an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth
in the words. In like sort, if Peter should say to
Iohn, Thou art not Iohn, doubtlesse hee should not lye,
though hee spake an vntruth, because hee cannot speake
that with purpose to deceiue Iohn himselfe.</hi> And hereof
hee giueth this reason, <hi>Because a lye is a kinde of fiction
or faining, which is in the will, with reference to another,
by which a man intendeth that another man may beleeue
otherwise than himselfe, who telleth the lye, doth thinke.
And that a lye doth include such respect and refirence to
another, is plaine</hi> (saith hee) <hi>because that veracirie,</hi> or
the vertue of speaking truth, <hi>which is opposite to lying,
doth consist also in relation to another, because it is a part
of iustice.</hi> Thus reasoneth this learned Frier. In this
discourse of his wee may note two things. First, His
Conclusion, which is, that both <hi>lying</hi> and <hi>truth</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
taken, which hee calleth <hi>veracitie,</hi> doe consist in
a relation and reference to others; so that no words
vttered, without respect of signifying somewhat to
some other by them, can be either the sinne of lying, or
the vertue of true-speaking. Secondly, wee may note
his reason for proofe of this Conclusion; which is,
that <hi>veracitie,</hi> or the vertue of speaking truth, is a
<hi>part of iustice:</hi> and iustice hath a respect to some other,
to whom it giueth that which is his due. This reason
I take to be vnanswerable; and then his Conclusion
must needs be vndeniable. It is proued then that truth
morally meant, for a vertue or act of speaking truth,
which is a part of iustice, and a dutie which wee owe
to our neighbours; doth include a reference and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to others, which respect consisteth in signifying
or declaring our meaning to them, truely and sincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
But now in the <hi>mentall reseruation,</hi> shut vp in the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:12745:60"/>
Equiuocators breast, there is no such reference or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
nor doth it admit of any intendment, to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
or declare his meaning to others. Nay, it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
suppressed, and broken off from the speech which
is vttered in words, that nothing thereby may be sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
to the Hearer. It followeth then, that this <hi>reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation</hi>
hath no point nor piece of morall truth in it.
And therefore, if that part of the Equiuocators pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
which hee vttereth in words, were a false and
lying speech before; it must needes remaine a lye still,
for any helpe that this Reseruation can yeeld it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. The Doctrine of Equmocation doth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbe
humane societie, and destroyeth that mutuall
commerce that one man should haue with another. I
proue it thus. This societie and commerce must needs
be disturbed, when men in wisedome may not beleeue
one another, vpon their words or oathes: but if this
Doctrine of Equiuocation be receiued, men may not
beleeue one another, either vpon their words or
oaths. This is prooued thus. The Equiuocator pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth
to <hi>equiuocate,</hi> whensoeuer hee may lawfully
hold his peace; and if it be for any aduantage of
weight, vpon his Oath too. Which how farre it may
extend, I haue declared in part already, and euery man
may easily conceiue by himselfe: but sure in what bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse
soeuer I haue to deale with such a man, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tell, but that he may thinke it lawfull to conceale
the truth, and consequently to <hi>equiuocate</hi> with mee.
And in case his conscience will permit him to <hi>equiuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate</hi>
with mee, (as in what case it will not permit him,
I know not) then am I as sure to be deceiued, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerreached
by him, if I doe beleeue him, as if I belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
a plaine and downe-right lyer. For, my credence
or beleefe can reach no futher then to the words vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered;
nor can I learne any thing from the Equiuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator,
but that which I can gather from his words:
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:12745:60"/>
but all that is false and lying; as hath beene shewed
by their owne Confession. And therefore if I beleeue
a man, when hee doth <hi>equiuocate,</hi> I am sure to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued.
I declare this yet further by a familiar exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
Say, two Priests haue layed a plot of Inuasion for
the Kingdome, and being questioned vpon their oaths
concerning the plot, they both deny it. And the one,
hee saith, <hi>I neuer meant or intended any such thing,</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
within himself, <hi>so as I meane to tell you of it:</hi>
and the other, hee answereth in the very same words,
but hath forgotten to frame a <hi>reseruation</hi> in his minde:
the one of these by their Doctrine is a lyer, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
an Equiuocator<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But in respect of being deceiued
by them, what difference is there betweene them?
Shall I not as soone be deceiued by the Equiuocator,
as by the Lyer? Yes certainely, it is no more safe to
beleeue an Equiuocating Iesuite, then a lying Deuill.
And if this be so; then where men teach and professe
the Arte of equiuocation, there in wisdome men may
not beleeue one another: and consequently, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
haue that commerce and societie that men should
haue among themselues. I conclude this argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Equiuocators, in the very same manner, as Saint
<hi>Augustine</hi> did against Lyers, onely putting the name
of Equiuocator, where he did the name of Lyer.<note n="a" place="margin">Aut non est credendum bonis; aut credendum est ijs, quos cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimus debere a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquando mentiri; aut non est cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendum bonos aliquando <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

(saith hee) <hi>wee must not beleeue honest men; or wee
must beleeue them, who wee thinke ought sometimes to tell
a lye; or else, wee must beleeue that honest men will not at
any time tell a lye. The first of these three is pernicious,</hi>
(and ouerthroweth societie.) <hi>The second is folish,</hi> (and
exposeth a man to the mercy of euery cheating compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.)
<hi>It remayneth therefore to say, that an honest man
will neuer tell a lye.</hi> Thus that learned Father: by whose
example I may reason against Equiuocators in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
same manner. Either wee must not beleeue honest
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:12745:61"/>
men on their words or oathes: or wee must beleeue
them, who wee thinke may <hi>equiuocate</hi> with vs both
in words and in oathes: or else, wee must beleeue that
an honest man will not <hi>equiuocate.</hi> The first is pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
the second is foolish: and therefore wee must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue
vpon the third, which is, that an honest man will
not <hi>equiuocate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. This Doctrine of Equiuocation defeateth
all Lawes made against lying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and doth by consequence
impeach God of folly for making any such Lawes. I
proue it thus. It is a folly to make such Lawes, as are
vnauaileable, and cannot reach to the ends, for which
they were made. But if Equiuocation be admitted,
Lawes against lying cannot serue for the purpose, to
which they are intended. This appeareth by two
things. First, Gods Lawes and precepts against lying
were made for this purpose, to restraine mens tongues
from speaking of falshoods and vntruthes. But by the
Arte of Equiuocation a man may speake any and all
falshoods that hee will, and yet these precepts against
lying shall neuer take hold of him: because by a men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
<hi>reseruation</hi> warranted by this Doctrine, hee may
make any falshood to become true. And therefore the
Equiuocator, notwithstanding all Lawes of God and
men against lying, yet is at his libertie to vtter what
vntruths hee will, without the least transgression of
any of those Lawes. Secondly, Lawes against lying
doe intend preuention of hurt and deceit to be vsed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
our neighbour. But admit once of this new do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Equiuocation, and no deceit toward our
neighbour can be preuented by any Lawes against ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
For if this Doctrine be warrantable, then all
Lawes against lying must be meant onely against such
as doe not keepe a reseruation in their mindes, to
make true the falshoods that they vtter in their
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:12745:61"/>
words. And so, for example, when <hi>Moses</hi> saith,
<note n="a" place="margin">Leuitie. 19. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Yee shall not lye one to another:</hi> and when Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
saith,<note n="b" place="margin">Ephes. 4. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>Put away lying, and speake truth euery man with
his neighbour;</hi> the meaning of these Precepts must be
to this purpose<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Speake no vntruth, nor vtter no falshoods
to your neighbours, vnlesse yee haue some secret reseruation
kept in your minde, which if it be added, will make them
to become true.</hi> For, by the Equiuocators Doctrine, if
such <hi>reseruations</hi> be kept in the minde, then all their
words become true: and therefore they are no way
included within these Precepts against lying. But if
this interpretation of such Lawes may be admitted,
and such libertie of speech may be granted, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
breach of these Lawes: then these Lawes doe no
way preuent the least danger of deceit and dammage
that may come to our Neighbour by vntrue and false
speeches; because I can deceiue him as much by this
equiuocall <hi>reseruation,</hi> as by a formall lye: as hath been
proued already. And from these considerations it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth,
that Precepts against lying are vaine, if the
practice of Equiuocation be lawfull.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 5. If the Doctrine of Equiuocation be true,
then neither men nor Deuils can be conuinced of ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
First, men cannot. For though they speake ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
so vast and apparent falshoods, yet who can say
but that they haue some <hi>reseruation</hi> in their minde,
that may free their words from being lyes? And yet
all sorts of men, when they heare euident vntruthes
vttered, doe without controll of any, charge the
speakers with falshoods and lying. Which shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that all men iudge of lying and truth, by the
words vttered, and not by fancies reserued in the
minde. As for example, the Secular Priests doe
charge Father <hi>Persons</hi> with a continuall practice of
lying, so that<note n="c" place="margin">D Ely in his Notes vpon the Apologie. cap. 9. pag. 311. D. Bagshaw in his Answ. to Persons Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie, pag. 42. Reply to a briefe Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, cap. 2. pag. 11.</note> they giue him <hi>the Whetstone, and leaue
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:12745:62"/>
it with him too,</hi> as if they thought there were no such
a bold and impudent lyer in the World, that could
winne it from him. But how did the Priests know,
but that <hi>Persons</hi> spake with some <hi>equiuocall</hi> reseruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?
And if so, then they broke the rule of charitie,
in censuring him for a lyer, when hee was but an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiuocator.
And againe, Father <hi>Persons</hi> chargeth the
Seculars with<note n="a" place="margin">Apologie for Subord. cap. 12. in the latter end.</note> 
                  <hi>infinite number of vntruthes, lyes, slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and open falshoods vttered without scruple of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science;</hi>
so that <hi>the vse of Equiuocations was little need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for them;</hi> because they could take libertie enough
without it. But how doth Father <hi>Persons</hi> know, that
his Secular Brethren did not vse Equiuocation in all
these vntrue speeches: and so made them true by
some <hi>reseruation?</hi> Thus all men, when they finde ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
vntruthes vttered, sticke not to charge the
speakers with lying. But if the Doctrine of Equiuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
be true, no man can be conuinced of the least
lye, vnlesse himselfe will confesse it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Deuill himselfe, if this Doctrine be
true, cannot be conuinced to be a lyer. For who can
say, but when he telleth vs most palpable vntruthes,
yet hee may reserue within himselfe some clause to
helpe all? Nay, if this Doctrine be true, it cannot
be supposed with any reason, that the Deuill euer
would or euer did tell any lye at all. For, whatsoeuer
he hath spoken at any time, be it otherwise neuer so
false and lying; yet it might be made true by a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation:</hi>
and hee neither wanted wit to deuise such
<hi>reseruations,</hi> nor will, by such or any other meanes
to free himselfe from the imputation of lying. First,
hee wanteth not wit. I shall not neede to proue this;
because, as I suppose, it will be confessed, that hee
is as quicke and nimble at such deuices, as the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
witted Iesuite in the packe. But, if any man
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:12745:62"/>
shall question it, I will engage my selfe to proue it.
Secondly, hee wanteth not will, by this or any other
tricke to saue his credit, and to auoid the imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of lying. For, hee knoweth that the greatest hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance
to his proceedings, is, because the World e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemeth
him for a lyer, and the Father of lyes: and if
he could once but gaine to be accounted a true and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
dealer, (as by vsing Equiuocation, he might as well
proue himselfe to be no lyer, as any Iesuite can:) then
hee might finde more credit in the World. For which
cause,<note n="a" place="margin">2 Corin. 11. 14.</note> the Apostle saith that hee <hi>transformeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
into an Angell of light.</hi> And an ancient Writer
telleth of a Monke, who was a strict and religious li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
that the Deuill,<note n="b" place="margin">Quum volens eum consuetudine visionum, ad cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulitatem futurae deceptionis illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, verissima quaque multo tempore, Diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> illusion</hi>
which hee intended for him, <hi>did for a lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>g time, as a
messenger of truth, shew him all true Visions.</hi> And
when by this meanes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hee had gained credit to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
then by another Vision, hee perswaded him to
renounce Christ, and to become a Iew. And it is an
vsuall obseruation among Christians, that the Deuill
will tell some truthes, that hee may gaine afterward
the more credit to his lyes. And therefore it can be
no doubt, but that the Deuill desireth not to be repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a lyer; and would gladly put off from him all
such imputation, if by any trickes hee could deuise
how to effect it. Now lay these two positions toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
first, That the Deuill wanteth no wit to deuise
<hi>reseruations;</hi> and secondly, That hee wanteth no will,
by this or any other such deuice, to auoid the discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
of a lyer: and then it will follow, that in reason
wee cannot imagine, that the Deuill euer would or
did tell a lye, if by an <hi>equiuocall</hi> reseruation hee could
cleare himselfe. And hence againe it may be dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
that as our Equiuocators doe challenge vs for
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:12745:63"/>
slandering them; because wee call them lyers, when
they sweare falshoods by imagined <hi>reseruations:</hi> so the
Deuill himselfe might challenge GOD (be it spoken
with reuerence to his Maiestie) for iniustice and slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
because hee hath branded him with the note of
a lyer, and calleth him the Father of lyes. But these
consequents are most absurd: and therefore the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Equiuocation, from whence they follow, is
most false.</p>
               <p>Thus, by Gods grace, I haue declared, and I trust,
in some measure also cleared the poynts propounded
in the beginning. Now, for conclusion, I will onely
commend one Caueat to the well-meaning Christian;
and that is, to beware of trusting them, whose pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
is to <hi>equiuocate.</hi> For such men are both more
impious and more dangerous than any other sort of
lyers, that I know beside.</p>
               <p>First, They are more impious, because among men
of other Religions, though there may be vicious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
that make too common a practice of lying de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits;
yet that is the fault of the men, and not of their
Doctrine. But in the Church of Rome, their great
Doctors doe not onely practise this deceit, but praise
it too: and commend it to their Disciples, as a <hi>good
Arte;</hi> very fit <hi>fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> scrupulous consciences.</hi> Which do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
cannot be conceiued to be without great disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to God, and much disgrace to Religion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They are more dangerous then any other
sort of Lyers, because they come masked vnder a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
of truth, &amp; armed with resolution to protest, and
sweare, and pawn their soules and saluations, vpon the
truth of that which they say, notwithstanding that for
so much as they vtter, and for all that you can heare or
gather by them, all is most false, which they speake.
From the consideration whereof, I inferred before, that
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:12745:63"/>
it was not safe to beleeue a Iesuite, or any of his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
or schollers; for that a man may as soone be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
by an Equiuocating Iesuite, as by a lying De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill.
Now I adde, therefore wise Christians must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
of them; and if wee will not be decei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed, wee
must not beleeue either their words or oathes, in what
businesse soeuer wee haue to doe with them. This Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueat,
that it may the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tter appeare how farre it is to
be extended; I will, for example sake, set downe
some speciall cases of ordinarie vse, in which it will
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> to beleeue them.</p>
               <p>1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>irst then we may not safely beleeue them, when
they are disputing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and arguing for their Religion, and
deliuering points of their faith. For they tell vs, that
Iesus our Lord did equiuocate, when hee preached of
Prayer and Sacraments, and of his office of iudging the
World, &amp;c. And I trow, Iesuites will be ready to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
the example of Iesus, whose name they beare. But
we need not doubt of their meaning in this case; for
they therefore alledge the example of Christ; that they
may defend and make good their owne practice. And
therefore when I heare a Priest or a Iesuite telling of
Popes Pardons, and preaching of S. <hi>Patricks</hi> Purgat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
&amp;c. and when for these, he telleth me, of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of the ancient Church, and alledgeth many Fathers
to confirme his Assertion; how can I be sure, that hee
doth not <hi>equiuocate</hi> with mee in that case? or what
reason haue I to thinke, but that he speaketh against
his knowledge, and conscience? or how can I, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a note of rashnes and temeritie, beleeue that he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
doth not wilfully belye the Fathers, and other Authors
to serue his owne turne? and when he hath done all,
make vp all with a secret <hi>Reseruation,</hi> that I neuer
dreamed on?</p>
               <p>Secondly, Wee may not beleeue them, when they
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:12745:64"/>
giue Answers, or beare witnesse in a Court of Iustice,
or before a Magistrate; no, not though they sweare
what they say, and take it vpon their soules and salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
For they professe to <hi>equiuocate</hi> in such cases, if
either the Iudge be <hi>incompetent,</hi> or if he proceed <hi>incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petently.</hi>
And when I heare one of them speake and
sweare before any of our Gouernors or Rulers, either
Ecclesiasticall or Ciuill, what can I tell, but hee may
thinke either the Iudge, or his proceedings to bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>competent,
and vniust? Nay sure, in most cases, in
which they haue to doe before our Gouernors, they
are knowne to hold, either the Iudge, or the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
or both, to bee incompetent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And therefore I
cannot see how wee may safely beleeue them, when
they make answere, or giue euidence vpon their
oath.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Wee may not beleeue them, when they
tell of great wonders and Miracles, done by men of
their Order and profussion; and by Saints and Images
of their owne making. For they professe to <hi>equiuocate,</hi>
when it may bee for some good to themselues, and
therefore much more when it may proue so great a
good to their Order, to their Church, and to their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
And therefore, when they tell mee of many
great miracles don<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> by their men in the Indies, and by
the Ladies of <hi>Lauretto</hi> and <hi>Hall;</hi> how can I tell, that
they doe not fitten and deuise all that vpon their fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
end, to gaine credite to their profession?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, We may not beleeue them, when they
publish and disperse disgracefull tales and reports a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the professors and Doctors of our Church. For
the disgracing of these men, may breede great aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to their Religion: and beside, it is an Axiom of
theirs, <hi>He must bee disgraced, because he is an Enemy to
their order.</hi> And therefore, when they tell mee of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:12745:64"/>
and <hi>Caluin</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> and <hi>Bucer</hi> and such others,
that they either despaired, or recanted, or renounced
their Religion; how may I beleeue them, that they
doe not Equiuocate? Nay it is certaine, that in the
forging of these reports, they did either lye, or <hi>Equiuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,</hi>
or both. And therefore when they now tell vs,
that many of our Reuerend Bishops, and learned Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
and Schollers, are of their opinion, and thinke
them to be in the right, but that for the worlds sake,
they dissemble their iudgement; how can I giue credit
to their words, or to their writings? And when they
tell vs, that such a Doctor, vpon his death-bed; and such
a Bishop toward his latter end, turned Papist, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
in their eare, what he had taught in the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit,
and was reconciled to the Church of Rome, by
one that came and went inuisibly; shall wee beleeue
them to speake as they thinke? Nay, wee should ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
spit in the Lyers faces, that presume vs to bee so
simple, as to beleeue an Equiuocator in a case so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaileable
for his Order, and in a thing so vnlikely and
absurde in it selfe; that the narration of such a
thing, might call in question the truth of a knowne ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
man.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, We may not beleeue Equiuocators in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of common life, and ciuill conuersation. For they
professe to <hi>equiuocate</hi> in most cases of common pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
and in all cases in which they are not bound to
reueile the Truth, if the thing may be for their aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.
And therefore if one of them should contract
to marry a mans daughter amongst vs, how can any
of vs tell, that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Equiuocator thinketh himselfe
bound to lay op<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n his heart, and to speake the
truth in this case; and that therefore in his opinion
he may not equiuo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ate and deceiue vs? And if he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
to pay me a summe of money, how can I tell that
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:12745:65"/>
he keepeth not a <hi>reseruation</hi> behind, that may disanull
his promise aforehand; as that he will pay it, if him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
shall thinke it necessary, or if he shall haue so much
to spare, or if hee haue nothing else to doe with his
money? &amp;c. And so, if he vndertake to be my Sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
for my Law-businesses, or my Physitian for my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
or my Counsellor in any doubtfull case, &amp;c. how
shall I be assured that I may beleeue his word, and that
he doth not for some secret reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> kept to himselfe, think
it lawfull to cheate me by a mental <hi>reseruation?</hi> Surely,
for mine own part, if I may know him that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth
the Art of <hi>Equiuocation,</hi> I wil trust
him no further then I would doe a
common and noted Lyer, that
is no further then I
do see him.
