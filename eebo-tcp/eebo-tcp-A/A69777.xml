            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>AMongſt the many <hi>Spiritual mercies</hi> by which within theſe fifty years laſt paſt, <hi>England</hi> hath been <hi>exalted to heaven</hi> (as our Saviour ſaid of <hi>Capernaum)</hi> the plenty of <hi>good Books</hi> hath not been the leaſt, ſo as there is hardly any point in <hi>Divinity,</hi> which hath not been <hi>judiciouſly</hi> handled, both <hi>dogmatically, polemically,</hi> and <hi>practically,</hi> and diſcourſes upon it publiſhed in our own Tongue. The things hid in times of <hi>Popery,</hi> yea and for many years in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>our Reformation,</hi> have been made known; the things <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered</hi> have been <hi>revealed;</hi> what was at firſt ſpoken in <hi>darkneſs,</hi> hath been told <hi>in the light, preached upon the houſe tops,</hi> and ſo publiſhed, that all thoſe who would might <hi>read,</hi> and <hi>underſtand.</hi> Certainly no Nation under Heaven (of which we have any record) was ever bleſſed with the Means of Grace to that degree; none ever had more <hi>judicious Interpretations of the Word of God,</hi> nor more <hi>ſerious</hi> and <hi>faithful Applications</hi> of it to the <hi>Conſciences</hi> of men and women; ſo as if either the <hi>Doctrine</hi> or <hi>Duty</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> be yet hid to any, it is much to be feared that it is to ſuch only who ſhall periſh. But of all good Books we have been <hi>exalted</hi> in none more than thoſe which have bin wrote on practical Subjects, Books of all others to be moſt highly valued, as more immediately ſerving the great end of man, in ſhewing him the way of Salvation, directing his coming to Chriſt, and walking with him, of which we have had ſuch plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as indeed there would be no more need of writing on ſuch Subjects, if the <hi>Vanity</hi> of our Natures did not more incline us to a <hi>diſcourſe</hi> upon the ſame <hi>Argument</hi> newly wrote, than to what hath been written as well ſome years ſince, by which means, the <hi>multiplying</hi> of good Books doth not a little contribute to the <hi>much reading</hi> of good Books, and that I am ſure contributes much both to <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>practice</hi> (the two great ends that every <hi>Preacher</hi> ought to aim at;) ſo as I cannot be of their mind who would have no more written of this nature, becauſe ſo much hath been alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy wrote, any more than I can be of theirs, who think there is now no ſuch need of <hi>Preaching,</hi> becauſe formerly there hath been ſo much. So long as there are any Souls in the World, who <hi>know</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:61084:3"/>
               <hi>not Chriſt,</hi> and live not up to the <hi>Rules of his Goſpel,</hi> there will be need both of the one and of the other; nay, were there none ſuch, there would be need of it, to keep up the <hi>Grace of God</hi> beſtowed upon men in its <hi>warm exerciſe.</hi> Nor me thinks ſhould there be one <hi>Preacher of the Goſpel</hi> who ſhould not publiſh the glad tidings of it, and leave ſome <hi>Record</hi> to the Ages to come, of his faithfulneſs in that work. The <hi>Riches of Divine Grace</hi> can never be too much pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, we can never enough declare his love, who <hi>for our ſakes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came poor, that we through his poverty might be made rich.</hi> Such like thoughts as theſe, <hi>Madam,</hi> have brought theſe Diſcourſes into a more publick light: They were compoſed many years ſince, ſoon after my entrance into the publick Miniſtry. I am willing they ſhould be a <hi>Teſtimony</hi> to the world, what Doctrine I then Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſee no cauſe yet to be aſhamed of, and what ſcope or deſign I have alwaies propounded to my ſelf: The <hi>Goſpel</hi> of <hi>the Kingdom; Chriſt; The faithſul ſaying, worthy of all acceptation, that Chriſt Jeſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

The Apoſtle <hi>Doctrine,</hi> Acts, 4. 12. <hi>That there is no Salvation in any other</hi> then in Chriſt, <hi>for there is no other name under Heaven given amongſt men whereby we muſt be ſaved,</hi> were the great things, I took my ſelf concerned as a Preacher to publiſh to the world. Together with what our Saviour hath taught us, <hi>That he who believeth him i not condemned: But he that believeth not is condemned already—ſhall not ſee life, but the wrath of God abideth on him, Joh.</hi> 3. 18. 36, and that <hi>Faith without works is dead.</hi> Theſe were the grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> things I had in my eye, to open, explain, and apply to people. My apprehenſion that I ſaw much of theſe things revealed in the <hi>Song of Solomon</hi> (though clouded under <hi>Metaphorical expreſſions)</hi> was that which led me to the ſtudy of that difficult portion of holy Writ; than which undoubtedly there is no portion of the Old Teſtament more <hi>Evangelical,</hi> according to the common <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> agreed by the moſt valuable Divines in all Ages, <hi>viz. That it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a Dialogue between Chriſt and his Church, or particular believing Souls in it.</hi> If any think I might have choſen plainer Texts from which to diſcourſe theſe things, I freely yield it as to many of them. But ſhall this excellent Book, alwaies acknowledged a ſacred portion of holy Writ, by the wiſeſt man upon earth ſtiled the <hi>Song oſ Songs</hi> (that is, the moſt excellent Song) lie by us as the <hi>Viſion of a Book that is ſealed,</hi> or be bound up in our Bibles for nothing?

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>SOme few years ſince, I was prevailed with to publiſh ſome diſcourſes upon the <hi>Second Chapter</hi> of this <hi>excellent Song.</hi> I had then by me theſe upon the firſt <hi>Chapter,</hi> but they being compoſed in my young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er years, I was deſirous firſt to peruſe them, before I ſuffered them to come forth into the World, ſince which time I have had ſo little reſt that the peruſal of them hath taken up much longer time than I then thought upon. The publiſhing of my diſcourſes upon the <hi>Second Chapter</hi> firſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged me to take ſomething out of theſe diſcourſes, to make thoſe as intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible as I could, concerning the <hi>Penman,</hi> of the <hi>Book,</hi> and the <hi>Nature form,</hi> and <hi>ſtile</hi> of it, which I have here reſtored to their due place with ſome advantage (all thoſe things falling in to the handling of the firſt verſe) I am not, upon the perſual of notes compoſed ſo many years ſince, my ſelf much pleaſed with the largeneſs of my diſcourſes upon the five or ſix firſt verſes, occaſioned from the variety of <hi>Propoſitions</hi> raiſed from them, but there are couched in thoſe verſes ſome very great points, and my conſulting ſo many expoſitors as I did, together with my prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſuſpect my own judgment rather then thoſe whom I had reaſon to prefer before my ſelf, was the cauſe of that. Nor did I think it much material, if I ſaw a <hi>Propoſition</hi> offered me by any valuable interpreter as feunded on one of thoſe verſes, which I ſaw was a <hi>Propoſition of truth,</hi> and juſtifiable from other <hi>Scripture,</hi> whether it were certainly there founded or no, for he pretends to too much skill, that will be too <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive</hi> in giving the ſenſe of a <hi>metaphor</hi> in this or that Text. It is enough for a modeſt <hi>Interpreter</hi> to give a probable ſenſe of ſuch expreſſions, and to prove it from a <hi>plainer Revelation.</hi> I hope thou wilt be ſo charitable to me, as to think that I troubled not a Popular auditory, with all that thou wilt find here in the opening of the ſeveral verſes. I bleſs God I was never ſo idle as to make up diſcourſes to people of what I knew they did not underſtand. What I found in my notes put in for my own Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I have let go, not knowing but my book might fall into the hands of ſome Scholar, who might be able to judge from what Satisfied me, upon what grounds I formed ſuch <hi>Propoſitions of truth</hi> as I did from the ſeveral verſes ſo preparing the matter of more Popular, and practical diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. I bleſs God I always looked upon the work of the miniſtry, as the
<pb facs="tcp:61084:469"/>
moſt grave, and ſerious employment under Heaven, whether the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſpeaks with reference to <hi>explication</hi> or <hi>application.</hi> In the firſt he acts as an <hi>Interpreter,</hi> making the words of the eternal God, more plain, and intelligible to the infirm capacityes of his people. How great is that work to be the Lords <hi>Interpreter?</hi> In the latter he acts as an <hi>Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,</hi> perſuading, and offering terms of peace between God, and man, and uſing all his art in intreating men to be reconciled to God. <hi>Who is ſufficient for theſe things?</hi> As to the former we have no more accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date means, then ſearching the Original texts, comparing the uſage of words in one Text with the uſage of them in others, conſulting In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters who have gone before us, then uſing our own judgments, as to what they have ſaid, or our own thoughts ſhall further ſuggeſt to us; thou wilt diſcern that this is the method I have uſed, and if in any thing I have been miſtaken, I have erred neither <hi>wilfully</hi> nor <hi>ſingly.</hi> When I had examined the ſeveral verſes, my work was to raiſe <hi>Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> from them ſo interpreted, to open them, to juſtify them to be divine truths from other places of plainer <hi>Revelation.</hi> For my <hi>method,</hi> and <hi>ſtile,</hi> it is what I judged moſt accommodate to the end of my work. No man diſcourſeth to any length upon a ſubject without a <hi>method,</hi> ſome uſe a <hi>Cryptick method,</hi> which is only for their <hi>own conduct,</hi> others a plainer <hi>method</hi> for the advantage of others, the former may do well enough in the Schools, where the end is only to raiſe ſome ſubitaneous affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; I never thought it proper for the Pulpit, where the Preachers end is or ſhould be, to inform his People in the great things of God, and to affect their hearts, and in order to it he is bound to ſpeak with the beſt advantage both for their <hi>memories</hi> and <hi>underſtandings,</hi> thou wilt find I have kept to the ordinary plain method of <hi>explication,</hi> confirmation, and application. <hi>No man having drank old wine deſireth new, for he ſaith, the old is better.</hi> In the proof of <hi>Propoſitions</hi> I have rather ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the evidence of holy writ, and Scriptural reaſon, then other more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain <hi>Topicks,</hi> knowing it the duty of Miniſters to take care, that the faith of their people, may <hi>not ſtand in the wiſdom of men, but in the power of God.</hi> One plain Text of holy Writ more confirms a <hi>Propoſition</hi> of <hi>Divine truth</hi> to an underſtanding Chriſtian, then an hundred rational arguments. For my ſtile it was the leaſt of my ſtudy, my Opinion always was that what <hi>Auguſtine</hi> calls <hi>diligens negligentia,</hi> was the beſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence as to that; while I was yet a very young man I had learn'd out of him, that it was no Soleciſm in a Preacher to uſe <hi>oſſum</hi> for <hi>os,</hi> for (ſaith he) <hi>an Iron key</hi> is <hi>better then one made of gold, if it will better open the door,</hi> for that is all the uſe of the key. I had learn'd out of
<pb facs="tcp:61084:470"/>
               <hi>Hierom,</hi> that a gaudry of phraſes, and words in a Pulpit is but <hi>Signum inſipientiae.</hi> The words of a Preacher; ſaith he, ought <hi>pungere, non palpare,</hi> to prick the heart, not to ſmooth and coax. The work of an Orator is too precarious for a Miniſter of the Goſpel. <hi>Gregory</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that our Saviour hath not ſtiled us <hi>the ſugar</hi> but <hi>the ſalt of the Earth,</hi> and <hi>Auguſtine</hi> obſerveth, that though <hi>Cyprian</hi> in one Epiſtle ſhewed much of a florid Orator, to ſhew he could do it, yet he never would do ſo any more, to ſhew he would not. The ſtudy of words, the right placing of them for their better chiming, &amp;c. I always thought a <hi>pue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rile,</hi> and <hi>pedantick thing,</hi> fitter for a School boy, then a miniſter of the Goſpel. Honeſt Souls when they come to hear the word do not come to ſee <hi>Reeds ſhaken with the wind of</hi> Oſtentation and Vain-glory, nor yet to ſee <hi>men clothed with the ſoft rayment</hi> of fine expreſſions and phraſes, (which for the moſt part like ſuch clothes have leaſt efficacy to warm a Soul, or to keep it in any Religious heat) they come to <hi>hear a Prophet,</hi> yea <hi>more then a Prophet,</hi> a man that ſhall reveal the mind and will of God to them. To me the moſt tunable tongues in Pulpits, always ring moſt awke. It is beneath the gravity of a Preacher to tickle a wanton Ear. The end of all words is but to convey to our minds the knowledg of things, and thoſe are the beſt words that do that beſt, <hi>grandia granditer dicenda.</hi> I never thought my ſelf further concern'd as to words, then to ſpeak in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligibly, and ſo as through no rudeneſs or indecency of phraſe to make Perſons nauſeate my diſcourſe who had a juſt Reverence for divine things. Words will always follow matter, but <hi>matter</hi> doth not always attend words. I bleſs God I early diſcerned and avoided this trifling, rather deſiring to humble that ſtile which was at my tongues end, then to ſtrain my tongue to a dialect which I either thought my People underſtood not, or was beneath the greatneſs of the ſubjects of my diſcourſe. If any think the portion of Scripture undertaken in theſe diſcourſes not fit for a Preacher, they ſhould do well to conſider, whether it be not a portion of holy writ, and ſuch a portion as the eminenteſt Divines in all ages, and of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions have thought worthy their pains to inquire the ſenſe of. Having thus far Apologized for the following diſcourſes I leave them to thy can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor and judgment, begging Gods bleſſing upon them to thy Souls advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,</p>

            <p>HAving undertaken this excellent portion of Holy Writ, for the Subject of theſe <hi>Exerciſes,</hi> it is reaſonable I ſhould (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the uſual, and commendable order of Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,) diſcourſe a little, concerning the <hi>Divine Authority of it;</hi> concerning the <hi>Subject matter of it;</hi> the <hi>Penman,</hi> the <hi>time,</hi> and <hi>occaſion of the writing of it,</hi> and concerning <hi>the form,</hi> eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering, that as to ſome or all of theſe, there are ſome <hi>difficulties</hi> to be aſſoiled, more than concerning other portions of Scripture, and concerning ſome of them, ſome things more peculiar to this, than any other Book.</p>
            <p>The firſt <hi>Verſe</hi> of the <hi>Song</hi> (which I have now read to you) gives me a ſufficient foundation for the moſt of my diſcourſe of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, if in any part of it I ſwerve from my Text, I ſhall yet keep to my buſineſs, which is by theſe <hi>previous exerciſes,</hi> to prepare you for
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61084:14"/>
clearer underſtanding of the <hi>ſacred contents</hi> of this <hi>Spiritual Song.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Text affords us theſe three propoſitions.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1 Prop.</hi> That this Book was <hi>Solomon's.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2 Prop.</hi> That it is a Song.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3. Prop.</hi> That it is a Song of Songs.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1.</note> The firſt will lead us to a diſcourſe of the <hi>Penman,</hi> and that, to a modeſt <hi>Enquiry</hi> after the <hi>time,</hi> and <hi>occaſion</hi> of his writing it, and (that well known) we ſhall eaſily determine the <hi>Author,</hi> and both from that advantage, and the auxiliary help of other Arguments conclude concerning its <hi>Divine Authority</hi> againſt all oppoſers.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2.</note> The ſecond leads me to the conſideration of the <hi>form of the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi> being <hi>Metrical</hi> and <hi>Dramatical.</hi> What elſe occurreth concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that, ſhall be there added.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">3.</note> The third will lead me to the conſideration of the <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Scope.</hi> I begin with the firſt of theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Prop. <hi>The Book of</hi> Canticles <hi>was</hi> Solomon's.</p>
            <p>This is ſo plainly aſſerted in the <hi>Hebrew Text,</hi> (where this is the firſt verſe) that it cannot well be denied, without the denial of the other matter contained in it; the only ground of ſcruple is becauſe of the particle ל prefixed in the Original, which is oft a note of the <hi>Dative</hi> or <hi>Accuſative Caſe,</hi> as if it were rather dedicated to <hi>Solomon,</hi> then written by him: But to clear this, we need not <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtopolitanus</hi> his fancy, that it is to ſhew us, that <hi>Solomon</hi> here ſang not of himſelf, but to the true <hi>Solomon Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> nor yet <hi>Delrio</hi>'s fancy, that it ſignifies as much as <hi>ſecundum, The Song of Songs accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to</hi> Solomon, as we ſay that the Goſpel according to <hi>Matthew,</hi> which was wrote by <hi>Matthew:</hi> for the inſtances in the Titles of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids Pſalms,</hi> are ſufficient to evidence the <hi>Grammar</hi> good enough, in making ל a note of the <hi>Genitive</hi> Caſe ſometimes.</p>
            <p>Taking that therefore upon the Credit of the <hi>Hebrew Text.</hi> Let us more particularly enquire;</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> Who this <hi>Solomon</hi> was.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> At what time he wrote this Sacred Book, and what <hi>(probably) gave him</hi> the occaſion of it.</p>
            <p>Solomon <hi>was</hi> the Son of <hi>David:</hi> the King of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 1. 6.</note> The Son of <hi>David</hi> by <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> the Wife of <hi>Uriah,</hi> born in <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5. 14. So named by his Father <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam</hi> 12. 24. at his Birth, it is ſaid, <hi>The Lord loved him.</hi> Upon which, v. 25. <hi>David</hi> ſent by <hi>Nathan,</hi> and called his name <hi>Jedidiah.</hi> i. e. <hi>beloved of God. (Abulenſis</hi> thinks it was not his proper name, nor

He ſucceeded his Father in the <hi>Kingdom</hi> by his Fathers <hi>appointment,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 1. 32. and reigned with ſuch an affluence of Divine Bleſſings, as none might compare with him. <hi>He loved the Lord,</hi> 1 Kings 3. 3. <hi>and walked in the Statutes of his Father.</hi> God in <hi>Gibeon</hi> appeared to him, ſaying, <hi>Ask what ſhall I give thee,</hi> v. 9. <hi>He asks a wiſe and underſtanding heart, to judge his people, and to diſcern good and bad aſunder;</hi> which ſaying, ſo pleaſed the Lord, that the Lord not only gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted what he asked, <hi>v.</hi> 10. 11, 12, 13. but alſo <hi>riches, and honour, ſo as there was none like unto him all his days.</hi> He builded the <hi>Temple,</hi> and the Lord again graciouſly appears to him upon his Prayer at the <hi>Dedication</hi> of the <hi>Temple,</hi> 1 Kings, ch. 9. The <hi>Queen of Sheba,</hi> came to admire his wiſdom, for <hi>he exceeded all the Kings of the Earth, in Riches, and Honour,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 10. 23. Now of this <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>That he loved many ſtrange Women, together with the Daughter of</hi> Pharaoh: <hi>Women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites, Sidonians, and Hitties,</hi> &amp;c. and v. 6. <hi>They turned away his heart from God, when he was old,</hi> and v. 5. he went after <hi>Aſhtaroth,</hi> and <hi>Milcom,</hi> and built high places, for <hi>Chemoſh,</hi> and for <hi>Molech,</hi> v. 7. And here ariſeth a Queſtion, to which it is reaſonable that I ſhould ſpeake ſomething in this place, becauſe this <hi>Song</hi> is judged to relate much to that action of <hi>Solomons</hi> life.</p>
            <p>

Daughter is mentioned, and afterward v. 3. it is ſaid. <hi>Solomon loved the Lord, I walked in the Statutes of</hi> David <hi>his Father.</hi> Certain it is (allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no tranſpoſitions) after this, God made his <hi>ſignal appearances</hi> to him in <hi>Gibeon,</hi> and upon the <hi>dedication of the Temple.</hi> Beſides, they urge the Friendſhip between <hi>David,</hi> and the <hi>King of Egypt,</hi> and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of <hi>Davids</hi> contracting this Marriage for his Son before his death. They further ſay, that the Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7. 3. did not <hi>ſimply,</hi> and <hi>univerſally forbid Marriages,</hi> with the Daughters of <hi>Idolaters. Joſeph</hi> Married <hi>Potiphar</hi>'s Daughter, <hi>Gen.</hi> 41. 45. <hi>Moſes</hi> Married <hi>Jethru</hi>'s Daughter, <hi>Exo.</hi> 2. 1. <hi>Boaz</hi> Married <hi>Ruth</hi> a <hi>Moabiteſs.

And there was a particular law directing the formality of ſuch Marriages, when any were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken captive. <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. 10, 11.

Others think that the Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7. only reſpected the <hi>Canaanites Daughters,</hi> who by Gods command were to be blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out, but that is of no value, for <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. 10, 11. they might marry <hi>Captives.</hi> They therefore think that he ſinned not in his marriage of her, but 1. In his <hi>multiplying of Wives</hi> expreſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Law. 2. In his <hi>exceſſive love to and fondneſs of her.</hi> 3. In his <hi>following her to Apoſtacy.</hi>

That when his days ſhould be fulfilled, and he ſhould ſleep with his Fathers, God would ſet up his ſeed after him, which ſhould proceed out of his bowels, and eſtabliſh his Kingdom, <hi>v. 13.</hi> I will eſtabliſh the Throne of his Kingdom for ever. <hi>v. 14.</hi> I will be his Father, and he ſhall be my Child.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In this Text you plainly diſcern a</hi> Covenant <hi>made with</hi> David, <hi>on the behalf of his Seed, and that Seed of his, that ſhould ſit upon his Throne (which was</hi> Solomon) <hi>as well as on the behalf of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.

            <p n="1">1. God covenants that although <hi>Solomon</hi> ſhould ſin, yet he would not <hi>take his mercy from him.</hi> The very term of <hi>Mercy</hi> ſignifies more, than the continuance of the Crown to him; for (as <hi>Tychonius</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves) <hi>David</hi> would have underſtood little mercy, for his Son to have enjoyed a temporal Kingdom, and loſt an eternal inheritance.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The puniſhment which God threatens to him in caſe of ſinning was but a Rod.</hi> The <hi>Rod</hi> of <hi>Men:</hi> for if we ſhould allow nothing to <hi>Pineda's</hi> Criticiſme, upon the term uſed <hi>[Enoſh]</hi> to ſignify men here, which properly ſignifies <hi>a weak old man,</hi> who cannot lay on ſtrokes hard, but chaſtiſeth his Child gently, ſo as the <hi>Rod of Men</hi> here mentioned, ſhould be oppoſed to the <hi>grounded ſtaff</hi> mentioned <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 30. 32. which God makes to reſt upon others, yet certainly
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61084:17"/>
the termof <hi>a Rod;</hi> with the adjunct <hi>of Men</hi> ſpeaks a very gentle chaſtning, with which <hi>eternal puniſhment</hi> is no way conſiſtent.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Add to this; <hi>That the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> (the moſt certain Interpreter of Scripture) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 18. Applies the very promiſe here made to the Children of God, <hi>I will be a Father unto you, and you ſhall be my Sons, and Daughters:</hi> I ſay who ſo conſidereth theſe things muſt certainly conclude that Gods obligation by this Covenant extended further, than the continuance of the temporal dominion in his line, which is alſo advantaged, by the conſideration that <hi>Solomon</hi> in his life time was chaſtened with the <hi>Rods of Men,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 11. God<note place="margin">1 Cor 11. 32.</note> ſtirred up againſt him <hi>Hadad: Rezin</hi> and <hi>Jeroboam, He was doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs chaſtened of the Lord that he might not be condemned with the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor can any reaſonably think to avoid the dint of the Argument, drawn from theſe Texts, by telling us, <hi>That a greater than</hi> Solomon <hi>is underſtood in them,</hi> even he of whom <hi>Solomon</hi> was but a <hi>Type.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For although it be true, that divers of the Ancients favoured that notion, (amongſt whom was <hi>Auguſtine, Ambroſe, Tertullian,</hi> and <hi>Theodoret)</hi> and that ſome paſſages in the aforementioned Texts ſeem to be by the Holy Ghoſt himſelf applied to Chriſt, amongſt which that eminent part of this Covenant <hi>I will be to him a Father,</hi> &amp;c. beſides that others ſeem applicable to no other, as where he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to <hi>eſtabliſh his Kingdom for ever:</hi> yet it is as true, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe <hi>I will be to him a Father</hi> (as I ſhewed before) is alſo by the Holy Ghoſt applied to believers, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 18. and thoſe who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the <hi>Hebrew Idiome,</hi> know that the term <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>
               <note place="margin">4.</note> I find a 4th Argument for this eminent Perſon, brought from 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 24, 25. compared with <hi>Neb.</hi> 13. 26. and 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 3. 3. from whence <hi>De-La Champius</hi> obſerveth 3 things.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:61084:17"/>
1. <hi>That it is ſaid God loved him.</hi> 2 Sam. 12. 24.—<hi>And the Lord loved him.</hi> Neh. 13. 26. <hi>He was beloved of his God.</hi> 2. In token of this love God gave him his name <hi>Jedidiah, i. e.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of God. 3. The Scripture ſaith, <hi>he loved the Lord.</hi> The conſideration of the latter makes the plea vain, of thoſe who (to avoid the dint of this Argument) would interpret Gods love of that general favour which he extends to every Creature, diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed from that by which he elevates the Creature to a <hi>participation of the Divine Nature:</hi> for that love is not ſo efficacious, as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a reciprocal love in the Creature to God again, we therefore <hi>love him</hi> becauſe <hi>he loved us firſt,</hi> which being granted, unleſs we grant God as mutable as man, and deny what he hath ſaid, that <hi>whom he loves, he loves to the End:</hi> We muſt allow that <hi>Solomon,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his great miſcarriages, was yet beloved of God, and died in a ſtate of Grace.</p>
            <p>Now to theſe Arguments, might further be added, as ſtrong pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions in the caſe, yielding at leaſt ſome auxiliary ſtrength. That no Text ſpeaketh ſo deſperȧtely concerning <hi>Solomon;</hi> that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 11. 4. ſpeaking of his falling, ſeems to hint it a <hi>ſin of infirmity in his old age,</hi> and through the great <hi>temptation of his Wives:</hi> That he did only <hi>tolerate Idolatry,</hi> not make it the <hi>Religion of the Nation.</hi> That he after this (as is at leaſt probably and generally concluded) wrote (in teſtimony of his repentance) the book of <hi>Eccleſiaſtes.</hi> That he was the <hi>Sacred Penman of Scripture.</hi> Theſe things may much confirm our charitable opinion in the caſe, for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be true, that I know no reaſon to the contrary, but that God, who made uſe of the <hi>Son of Perdition,</hi> to preach his everlaſting Goſpel, might alſo with conſiſtency enough, to the wiſdom of his Providence, make uſe of a <hi>Child of Perdition,</hi> to write, and ingroſs what his holy Spirit firſt dictated; nor (ſaith <hi>Auguſtine)</hi> hath God leſs conſulted his own glory in it, for now all the good and glory of the truth revealed in thoſe books will be given to God; Beſide, it is ſaid that <hi>Balaams</hi> Song is alſo recorded in Scripture, and a piece of holy writ: yet conſidering that no one book of holy writ was wrote by ſuch a withered hand as that of a reprobates; and that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture fixeth no ſuch mark upon this great Perſon, who was the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of three Books there, and that one of theſe Books, at leaſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears (let <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſay what he will) to be wrote after the days of his Vanity, and hath in it evident marks of his nauſeating his luſts, and former vanities of pleaſure, love, riches, &amp;c.

there been wanting ſome, who have thought ſo of the other two Books alſo, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> and the <hi>Canticles.</hi> And to theſe if we add that he was an eminent Type of our Lord, and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt: I ſay if we lay all theſe things together, we ſhall (I think) neither ſtand in need of the <hi>Rabbinical</hi> figments, (who tell us for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal ſtories of <hi>Solomons</hi> repentance:) Nor yet of that auxiliary help, (in which <hi>Pineda</hi> much triumpheth) which <hi>Petrus de Caſtro</hi> affords; from that Sculpture in leaden Plates, (wrote in ancient <hi>Arabick Characters)</hi> and firſt diſcovered to <hi>James</hi> the Apoſtle, afterward, to the aforementioned Biſhop of <hi>Granada,</hi> who ſought for them<note place="margin">V.

To this I ſhall only add the obſervation, which ſome have made of that ſingular vertue, which the compoſing and ſinging of Songs, hath had <hi>to excite</hi> and <hi>inflame the affections.</hi> I remember our <hi>Divine Poet</hi> tells us, <hi>That he was moſt with God; while he was exerciſed in his Divine Poetry,</hi> Beſides, the ſuitableneſs that a Song hath unto the natures of others, the ſame Author obſerves,

            <p>Only give me leave as an Epilogue to this diſcourſe to ſubjoin the Judgment of <hi>Ludovicus de Ponte</hi> (though a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> yet a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Man) who hath copiouſly interpreted this Spiritual Song, and (allowing him the <hi>Popiſh Devotion</hi> for the <hi>Sacred Virgin,</hi> which makes them all think they ſee her in every Text) hath done much in it well. It is prefix'd to his <hi>Latine Commentary.</hi> To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <q>
               <p>The Book of <hi>Solomon</hi> (which from the nobleneſs of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is called the Song of Songs) is, a ſpiritual conference betwixt that God, who is <hi>three</hi> and yet <hi>one,</hi> or betwixt Chriſt who is true God, and Man, and his Church, whether ancient or modern: and every gracious Soul which is a Member of that Church. In which diſcourſe God hath a double part, and perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nateth two ſeveral Perſons: The perſon of a moſt wiſe <hi>Inſtructer</hi> or <hi>Maſter:</hi> delivering to his Diſciple the ſublime Doctrine of Faith and Holineſs. 2. The Perſon of a moſt <hi>endeared lover,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolling and courting his moſt beloved Spouſe, with wonderful praiſes; and enriching her with great gifts and favours: The Church alſo repreſents a double Perſon. 1. The Perſon of a Diſciple, or Spouſe, <hi>towards</hi> God, or the Perſon of a Miſtreſs, or companion towards other Souls which ſhe calls <hi>the Daughters of Hieruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Argument of this Conference, as well became ſuch Perſons, is ſublime, pleaſant, profitable, and abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly copious, for whatſoever the ancient Prophets ſang, whatſoever the Evangeliſts afterwards related; or the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles Preached, whether relating to the myſteries of faith, or to holineſs, and Goſpel perfection, it is all in this Song compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in the ſtyle of lovers; (the ſtyle being Spiritual not Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.) But becauſe the Metaphors and Similitudes, which fill this whole Book, are taken from Carnal Marriages. We muſt pill off the bark, that the letter might not kill. That being once taken off, the ſpiritual part lying within, will enlighten the Soul, and quicken, and inflame and perfect it. For according to our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours words, it is the Spirit that quickneth, the fleſh profiteth nothing: and the words of this Song are Spirit, and life, to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61084:24"/>
thoſe who do ſincerely conſider them. For as the Ancient Prieſts<note place="margin">Macch. 1. 20.</note> of the Jews (as we read in the Book of <hi>Macchabees)</hi> when they looked for the ſacred fire, which they had hidden, found nothing but thick water, which water (to the admiration of all) when the Sun ſhined out of the Cloud again, was turned into fire: ſo he who looks upon the Book of <hi>Canticles</hi> with carnal Eyes, will on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly find the puddle-water of words, which the outſide letter ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to ſhew, which will fill his heart with darkneſs inſtead of light, with a carnal chilling inſtead of ſpiritual heat. But if the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Sun inlightens, that which ſeemed puddle water, will become coeleſtial fire, wonderfully inlightning the underſtanding, and inflaming the will.—</p>
               <p>But although the whole Book of <hi>Canticles</hi> containeth 8 Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and by Interpreters be divided into three, five, or more parts, yet I believe the firſt, and ſecond Chapters are a ſum, or bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viary of all thoſe myſteries of Faith, which are contained in the ſix other Chapters; which is evidenced from this, that the cloſe of the ſecond and of the laſt Chap. are much the ſame, to ſhew us, that the narration of matter is finiſhed in the ſecond Chapter, and that from the third Chapter beginneth a new diſcourſe of the ſame myſteries under new Metaphors, and Similitudes.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A name is an appellation given to ſome perſon, or thing, either to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the nature, and being of it; or to diſtinguiſh it from another thing.</hi> God cannot properly be ſaid to have a name, becauſe no term can fully explicate to us his divine eſſence. But yet God is pleaſed in ſome little meaſure to make himſelf known to us: Now whatſoever God thus makes himſelf known unto us by, that is his name: More particularly: The ſecond Perſon in the holy Trinity, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as our Mediator, and in reference to the great work of mans redemption, had ſeveral names: <hi>One</hi> expreſſing the two natures which were united in that Divine Perſon, that was his name <hi>Emanu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> which ſignifieth God with us. Another expreſſing the great work which he had to do, <hi>viz. To ſave his People from their ſins,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">V. <hi>Greg.</hi> mag. ad loc. V. <hi>Genebr.</hi> ad loc. <hi>Lud. de Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te</hi> ad loc. <hi>Lyra</hi> ad loc.</note> his name was called <hi>Jeſus.</hi> A third expreſſing his deſignation &amp; conſecration to his Office; thus he was called <hi>Meſſiah</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> both ſignifying the ſame thing <hi>Anointed. Gregory</hi> underſtands it of the name Chriſt, and the name <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> ſo doth <hi>Lud. de Ponte. Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brard, Lyra,</hi> and others of the name Jeſus.</p>
               <p>But I know no reaſon why we ſhould diſpute ſo nicely for the <hi>particular name,</hi> when as Chriſt had ſeveral names, either expreſſive of his <hi>Divine, or Human nature, or of his perſonal capacity,</hi> as both Natures were united in him: or elſe <hi>expreſſing the vertues and graces of his Perſon:</hi> or elſe <hi>relating to one or another, or all his ſacred Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;</hi> and indeed what is ſaid in the Text, is true concerning every name of Chriſt as well as another: Each of his names is, <hi>As an Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment poured forth.</hi> And beſides I ſee a more comprehenſive interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the term equally true with this: <hi>Thy name.

               <p>I Have (in my former Exerciſes) opened the Text, and named thoſe propoſitions of Doctrine which are couched in the words, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally to be deduced from them. I come now to the particular handling of them, beginning with the firſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Prop. 1.</note> The thirſt of a believing Soul is after Spiritual diſtinguiſhing mercies.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1.</note> Nature teacheth every one to ſay, <hi>who will ſhew us any good?</hi> Good is a thing that all the creation is enamoured upon. God is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all goodneſs; Every <hi>good and perfect gift, cometh from above, from him who is the father of lights.</hi> Who being not a debtor to the creature, muſt needs diſpenſe it out <hi>freely.</hi> Hence that good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God which is his goodneſs of <hi>Beneficence,</hi> not only dwelling in him as a piece of his divine perfection: But flowing from him, as a ſtream from the fountain of his liberality, is properly called <hi>Mercy,</hi> whether it be good to us in reſpect of its ſutableneſs to our outward and bodily wants, or to our more inward, and Spiritual neceſſities. Hence the <hi>Mercies</hi> and <hi>ſavours</hi> of God, are either Bodily [reſpecting out outward Man] or Spiritual [reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our inward man.] The former (ſuch now, as <hi>life, health, peace and proſperity, riches,</hi> &amp;c.) are ſuch as God gives to his Enemies, as well as to his Friends; <hi>he maketh his Sun to riſe upon the evil and</hi>

                  <hi>the good: And ſendeth rain on the juſt and unjuſt, Math.</hi> 5. 45. Spiritual good things again, are either <hi>Gifts of common</hi> or of <hi>Special Grace.

Theſe are indeed <hi>Spiritual gifts,</hi> ſo called by the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 1. <hi>ch.</hi> 14. 1. becauſe <hi>given out by the Spirit of God;</hi> and tending to <hi>innoble the Spiritual part,</hi> and they are alſo called the <hi>beſt gifts.</hi> 1, <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 31.

                  </gap> ſo called: Not only becauſe they come from the <hi>Spirit of Grace,</hi> and <hi>innoble the Spiritual part of man,</hi> but becauſe they are <hi>ſuted to</hi> the <hi>greateſt neceſſities</hi> of our <hi>inward man.</hi> Such are the grace of <hi>Juſtification, Union</hi> to <hi>and reconciliation with God, pardon of Sin, and the Senſes of that pardon, together with all the fruits of the Spirit of regeneration,</hi> and <hi>Sanctification.</hi> Theſe are the diſtinguiſhing favours of God, which difference the Child of God from him that is not.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">3.</note> When Iſay the thirſtings of gracious Souls are after ſuch diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tokens of divine love. I underſtand it not <hi>Excluſively.</hi> The Children of God are made up of fleſh and blood, as well as any others, and ſubject to the ſame neceſſities and infirmities; they have in them cravings, and luſtings of the fleſh. David prayeth hard for his life <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39. <hi>ult.</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> for a <hi>Child,</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> for health. <hi>Jonas</hi> is fond of a <hi>gourd,</hi> and <hi>Agur</hi> beggeth <hi>food convenient for him,</hi> and although, <hi>Rachel</hi> may be too importunate for a Child, and <hi>Paul</hi> for the removal <hi>of the Thorn in his fleſh,</hi> yet there is a lawful deſire of the good things of this life allowed, yea, commanded us in that form of Prayer, which our Saviour preſcribes. We are bid to pray, <hi>Give us this day our daily bread.</hi> But the Child of God <hi>firſt</hi> ſeeks <hi>the Kingdom of God, and the righteouſneſs thereof, according to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours preſcript, Mat.</hi> 6. 33. I remember <hi>David</hi> hath ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion as this, <hi>Pſal</hi> 27. 4. <hi>One thing have I deſired of the Lord, that will I ſeek after, that I may dwell in the houſe of the Lord, all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to enquire in his holy Temple.</hi> If a Child of God had but one thing to ask of God, this ſhould be it, that it might <hi>behold the face of God;</hi> this is that which it would ſeek after, and look out for. Yea, this is that which their Souls deſire <hi>eminenter.</hi> Theſe are the things for which they will <hi>wreſtle with God,</hi> and <hi>will not let him go until he ſhall bleſs them</hi>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:61084:35"/>
                  <hi>with them.</hi> Other things they will beg, but theſe are the things their Souls will ſpend their ſtrength in, and lay the ſtreſs upon: did you hear the ſecret pleadings of the awakened Soul with God, you would eaſily diſcern the difference between the deſires it hath to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards outward things, and thoſe which are in it towards Spiritual, and diſtinguiſhing mercies, and be eaſily able to ſay: Thoſe are the things that this Soul would have, <hi>pardon of Sins, ſenſe of Gods love, victory over its luſts, and corruptions; ſtrength,</hi> and <hi>inlargement of heart in the ſervice</hi> of God. Theſe are the things which this Soul would have. It asks a Ring, but the kiſs is that to which it hath moſt mind. And all this muſt be underſtood of the gracious Soul, <hi>when it is itſelf;</hi> not in its fits of paſſion and infirmity: then <hi>Elijah,</hi> and <hi>Job,</hi> and <hi>Jonah,</hi> and any of the Children of God may ſpeak accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the fleſh, <hi>the law of their members prevailing againſt the law of their mind, hath brought them into captivity to the law of Sin.</hi> Theſe things being premiſed for the explication, the truth of the propoſition will be abundantly evidenced <hi>from the example of the man according to Gods own heart</hi> (holy <hi>David)</hi> and that in ſeveral Pſalms, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. 6. <hi>Lord lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon me.</hi> There be many that ſay, who will ſhew us any good, but <hi>Lord lift thou up the light of thy Countenance upon me.</hi> The light of the Sun will pleaſe others, but 'tis only <hi>the light of thy Countenance,</hi> that<note place="margin">Pſal. 63. v. 1. 2.</note> will pleaſe me, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63. <hi>v.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>My Soul thirſteth for thee, my fleſh longeth for thee: in a dry and thirſty land where no water is. To ſee thy power, and thy glory in the Sanctuary.</hi> The ſight of the Sanctuary will pleaſe another, but nothing will pleaſe <hi>David,</hi> but the ſight of <hi>Gods power, and glory in the Sanctuary.</hi> Other-where he prays, that the Lord would <hi>ſhew him his way, and unite his heart to fear his name.</hi> That God would <hi>come unto him, and ſhew himſelf unto him,</hi> &amp;c. Nor is it hard to find out the reaſon of it, which lies;</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1.</note> In the <hi>ſanctification</hi> of the <hi>renewed man,</hi> he hath a <hi>new heart given unto him.</hi> A new heart ſignifies a <hi>new underſtanding;</hi> a <hi>new will,</hi> and <hi>new affections.</hi> New, not as to the faculties themſelves, but as to the motions and operations of them, in which the ſoul ſtill fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the dictates of reaſon, and proceedeth in the method of a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional creature.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Soul is renewed in <hi>its underſtanding;</hi> from whence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth a new <hi>notion</hi> and <hi>Judgment concerning things.</hi> The old Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent cheated our firſt Parent, when he perſuaded her that the fruit of the forbidden Tree was to be deſired, becauſe <hi>in the day ſhe</hi>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:61084:35"/>
                  <hi>ſhould eat thereof, her Eyes ſhould be opened, and ſhe ſhould be as God, knowing good and evil;</hi> for from that day forward ſhe was ſtruck blind, and the Diſeaſe, (according to Divine ordination) proved hereditary: All we who are the Children of <hi>Adam,</hi> are born blind, neither able to take the true notion of good and evil, nor yet to make up a Judgment concerning either, diſcerning the things that differ: but naturally every one calleth <hi>Evil, good,</hi> and <hi>good, Evil.</hi> The Pſalmiſt ſaith, that <hi>man ſtood not in honour, but became like the Beaſt that periſheth.</hi> In this much like the Beaſt indeed, that we are meerly led by the conduct of a <hi>ſenſitive appetite,</hi> not diſcerning thoſe things which are truly and ſpiritually good: and the reaſon of this is our not underſtanding our ſelves, for the nature of all good lying in a conveniency, and ſutableneſs of the object to us, a knowledge of our own ſtate, and wants, muſt reaſonably be ſuppoſed to a right judgment concerning good and Evil. But amongſt other Evils ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crewing to us by the fall, this was one, that we are by nature <hi>Blind</hi> as to our own State, and <hi>Strangers to our own Souls,</hi> not underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that we are by Nature, <hi>Children of Wrath, poor, miſerable, blind,</hi> and <hi>naked,</hi> but conceiting that we have need of nothing. Hence it is that the Soul is not able to judge of the goodneſs of Union and Communion with God, pardon of ſin, reconciliation with God, &amp;c. Nor indeed doth it come to underſtand it, until the <hi>Eyes of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding be opened,</hi> by the application of Spiritual Eye-ſalve, laid on by the <hi>Finger of the holy Spirit of God.</hi> Till this time, the Soul ſeeth no <hi>beauty in Chriſt,</hi> nothing <hi>for which he ſhould be deſired.</hi> The goodneſs of <hi>Riches,</hi> and <hi>Pleaſures,</hi> and <hi>Honours,</hi> it knows, but as for that tranſcendent goodneſs and Excellency which is in Chriſt, what it is, it doth not underſtand; Hence it naturally deſires, life, health, riches, honours, ſucceſs in worldly affairs, and ſuch common gifts, as may ſerve it in the world, with credit, and applauſe, and reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But for <hi>ſpiritual things,</hi> for diſtinguiſhing tokens of love, it is not able to take the <hi>heighth,</hi> and <hi>length,</hi> and <hi>depth,</hi> and <hi>breadth of the love of God in them,</hi> nor to diſcern their conveniency, and <hi>ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs</hi> to its undone ſtate and condition; hence (with the Cock in in the Fable) it prefers <hi>the Barly Corn</hi> before that <hi>Pearl of great price,</hi> for the purchaſe of which, the wiſe Merchant is willing to ſell all that he hath. But now the regenerate ſoul hath its Eyes open, to diſcern the things that are excellent, and as it is taught by the Spirit of conviction, the truth of its natural and unregenerate Eſtate, ſo its Eyes are opened, to ſee that nothing but the ſpecial love of God
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:61084:36"/>
in Chriſt is a good ſuitable to it, or worthy of its caring for: and hence, the ſoul is taught by it's own reaſon, to <hi>thirſt</hi> after theſe mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtations of Divine Goodneſs, as thoſe which above all others, are proportioned to its wants, and higheſt neceſſities.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But 2dly. Theſe deſires are not the product of an <hi>enlightned underſtanding</hi> (only) but of a <hi>renewed will</hi> alſo. So wofully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved is our corrupt nature, that the inferiour powers of our Souls, have withdrawn themſelves from the command of reaſon; and whereas it is the method of a reaſonable Soul, to imbrace or refuſe a thing with the will according to the judgment, which is by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding given in concerning it: it often falls out otherwiſe by reaſon of our Souls diſorder.</p>
               <p>He that not only knoweth <hi>the will of God,</hi> but alſo approveth thoſe <hi>things which are moſt excellent,</hi> yet hath no hearthimſelf to cloſe with them, he is ready to teach another (like the hand of a Statue in a way which directeth a Traveller, but moveth not) he teacheth not himſelf; hence the renovation of the <hi>underſtanding</hi> (although the great wheel of the Soul) is not ſufficient to make the Soul to will thoſe things which are ſpiritually good. Mans Soul is like a Clock broken in pieces, every of whoſe Wheels muſt be mended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it will again move truly. But the gracious man is renewed, as well in <hi>Spirit</hi> as in <hi>Body,</hi> and in <hi>Mind.</hi> The day of the Lords Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is come upon him, and of <hi>unwilling,</hi> he is made willing.

Now there is nothing more pleaſing unto our Heavenly Father, than to ſee his Children, more ſond of their Fathers love, than of any thing elſe which is in his hand to beſtow upon them: And this is the true reaſon of the gracious Souls thirſt after ſpiritual things.</p>

to this great poſſeſſion, and an eaſy faith will aſſure the Soul, that if Men <hi>who are evil, know how to give good things to their Children,</hi> who are once poſſeſſed of their Affections, <hi>God will not be wanting to his People,</hi> eſpecially conſidering, that his liberality extends to the graſs of the Field, and to the Birds of the Air, becauſe they are his Creatures.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Uſe 1.</note> Let this notion (in the firſt place,) ſhew you <hi>the vaſt difference</hi> betwixt the <hi>renewed ſoul,</hi> and that which is yet in its <hi>natural eſtate.</hi> Grace (conſidering our weak eſtate) is not ſo eaſily diſcernable in us, from our <hi>Actions,</hi> as from our <hi>Affections.</hi> The bent of the heart doth beſt diſcover the ſtate of it, whether it be renewed or no. All Men and Women in the Chriſtian world come under one of theſe three ranks. They are either, 1. <hi>Profane, and diſſolute Perſons.</hi> Or 2. <hi>Hypocrites, or ſeeming profeſſors, who have a form of Godlineſs, but deny the power thereof.</hi> Or 3. Such as are <hi>Diſciples indeed;</hi> the true Children of God. God is the fountain of all mercy, and goodneſs, and nature itſelf teacheth man ſomething of this. Hence every ones Soul is looking out towards God for ſome good, or other. 1. The worldling, and profane Perſon ſays, <hi>who will ſhew us any good?</hi> But what is the good which he thirſts after? an increaſe of <hi>Corn,</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> and <hi>Oil:</hi> The objects for the luſts of the Fleſh, the luſt of the Eye, and the Pride of life, let the Swines belly be filled with theſe husks, and he is ſatisfied, let who will take <hi>Grace,</hi> and <hi>Heaven,</hi> and heavenly things; as he underſtands not his need of them, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> the excellency that is in them, ſo neither is his Soul carried out in any deſires after them. 2. The <hi>Hypocrites</hi> deſign is of another nature, he would fain appear to be ſomething (though indeed, all his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying be but a vain ſhew, and a meer appearance) when indeed he is nothing. Now that which he deſires is ſomething proportioned <hi>to this</hi> end, he poſſibly <hi>covets the beſt gifts,</hi> like <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> who when he ſaw, <hi>That through the laying on of the Apoſtles hands, the Holy Ghoſt was given,</hi> ſaid, <hi>Give me this power alſo, that on whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever I lay my hands, he may receive the Holy Ghoſt, Acts</hi> 8. 18. The Hypocrite may deſire a <hi>gift of Prayer,</hi> a <hi>gift of Prophecy,</hi> and ſuch like common gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, which may ſerve his deſign in appearing Godly, and Religious, and this ſatisfieth him. 3. But <hi>the gracious Soul is ſatisfied with none of theſe.</hi> All his deſire is after the gifts of ſpecial grace, the obtaining of union with, and reconciliation to God, the light of Gods countenance, &amp;c. and nothing leſs than this will ſatisfy his thirſt. It is reported of <hi>Luther</hi>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:61084:37"/>
(indeed he reports it of himſelf) that when he firſt Preached the Goſpel in <hi>Germany,</hi> he was much courted by ſome great Perſons, and preſented with many gifts, which made the good man jealous, that God intended to put him off with theſe things, but (ſaith he) <hi>Proteſtatus ſum,</hi> &amp;c, I made a proteſtation to my God that I would not be ſo ſatisfied. The Sons of <hi>Keturah</hi> may be put off with por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but <hi>Iſaac</hi> muſt have the inheritance): The gracious Soul, is a true <hi>Artabazus;</hi> he thinks his Saviours kiſs is better than a Cup of Gold: and indeed I know no better evidence of a gracious heart than this, to be found unſatisfied, without the ſpecial, and diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing love of God, yet that you may not deceive your ſelves, I muſt tell you, that as it is poſſible, that one who is a ſtranger to God, may deſire theſe diſtinguiſhing favours from God: So the deſire of thoſe good things which are but the iſſues of common providence, is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten found in gracious Souls, and that in too high a degree. But as the former proceedeth from ſome inconſtant principle, and laſteth not long in the unregenerate Soul, nor is much in earneſt, while it continues, but like <hi>Auguſtines</hi> deſire to be rid of his luſts, while in the mean time (as he confeſſeth) he ſecretly deſired, that God would not hear his prayer: ſo the latter deſires in the Child of God, are ſecondary, and ſubordinate, or (if irregular and immoderate) no more than fits of paſſion, out of which grace ſoon recovers him.</p>

Oh! let this be the lauguage of your Prayers: <hi>Let him kiſs me with the kiſſes of his Mouth:</hi> Let others beg of God Riches, and Honours, and the favours of Men: Let o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers beg the golden Ring, but do you deſire the kiſs.

                  <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                  <hi>The Soul of the rational Creature ſtands obliged by the law of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to deſire the beſt things:</hi> Is there any thing to be compared with ſpecial grace? this is that more excellent way which the Apoſtle propounds to be coveted before the <hi>beſt gifts.</hi> You read in the book of <hi>Eſther,</hi> ch. 5. v. 9. 11. concerning <hi>Haman,</hi> that he called for his Wife, and tells her of the great honour to which the King had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced him, and of his great Riches, but (ſaith he) <hi>all this avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me nothing, while I ſee</hi> Mordecay <hi>ſuting in the Kings Gate.</hi> When the poor worlding ſits down, and thinks how God hath bleſſed him with Riches, Honours, and whatſoever contentments the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can afford him, hath he not cauſe to ſay, <hi>All this availeth me</hi>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:61084:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>nothing, whil'ſt I have no aſſurance of the love of God,</hi> whil'ſt (for ought I know or have reaſon to believe) the wrath of God may be flaming againſt me, and I one of thoſe who ſhall after all theſe ſweet enjoyments, ſpend an Eternity in that fire which is prepared for the Devil and his Angels. <hi>Riches profit not in the day of Wrath,</hi> no nor any thing elſe will profit in that day, but an intereſt in Chriſt. How much better is a dinner of Herbs with the love of God, than great Treaſures with his hatred? A morſel of bread with an intereſt in Chriſt, than a ſtuffed Ox with the wrath of God?</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Theſe influences alone will evidence diſtinguiſhing love.</hi> Indeed other gifts may poſſibly ſpeak no love at all. The Iſraelites deſired a King, God granted them their deſires, and ſaith by his Prophet that <hi>he gave them a King in his Wrath.</hi> It may be truly ſaid, concerning the gifts of God to many a poor Creature, he gives them Riches in his Wrath, Honours in Wrath, outward proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in Wrath, outward good things dipt in divine vengeance, the wrath of God may ſmoke againſt them while the quails are betwixt their teeth. <hi>Poenalis nutritur impunitas.</hi> This is a ſecret of Divine Juſtice, which every one ſeeth not. It is the ſaying of a devout Author, that God often uſeth <hi>impios melle ſuo punire,</hi> to puniſh wicked men with their own Hony. But God never gives a kiſs in Wrath, he cannot give <hi>oſculum Iſcarioticum,</hi> where he kiſſeth, he loveth. God throws the good things of this life amongſt his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, his Friends living in the ſame world, it may be get ſomething of them, but they are no diſtinguiſhing mercies. But whomſoever he kiſſeth, that Soul is certainly beloved of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">3.</note> Thirdly, <hi>There are no petitions pleaſe God ſo well, as thoſe which are put up for ſpiritual things.</hi> When <hi>Solomon</hi> begged of God <hi>a wiſe and underſtanding heart,</hi> it is ſaid that <hi>the ſaying pleaſed the Lord well.</hi> Yea God ſhewed that it pleaſed him well, for he received in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance what he asked not. Nor is this hard to be conceived by us, who have the ſame affections towards our own Children, had any one of us who are Fathers, 2 Children, and we ſhould put it to their choice, what they would ask of us, and the one ſhould ask that we would ſettle ſo much land upon him, the other ſhould tell us, he deſired not our lands, but ſhould importunately beg that his Father would love him beſt, would not the latter pleaſe you beſt? ſhould we not be ready to give that Child-more than it asked? You read of the two Daughters of <hi>Naomi, Orpah,</hi> and <hi>Ruth, Ruth</hi> 1. 14, 15. they both followed their Mother in law while ſhe was full, but when ſhe was
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:61084:38"/>
empty, <hi>Orpah kiſſeth her Mother in law, and leaveth her, Naomi</hi> would have had <hi>Ruth</hi> have done ſo too; but <hi>v.</hi> 16. <hi>Ruth</hi> refuſeth, and tells her: <hi>Whither thou goeſt I will go, and where thou lodgeſt I will lodge, thy People ſhall be my People, and thy God ſhall be my God, where thou dieſt, I will die, and there will I he buried.</hi> Which is as much as if ſhe had told her, that ſhe valued the company of her Mother above all other concerns. Did not this think you indear her to <hi>Naomi?</hi> and certainly nothing can more endear a ſoul to God, than for it to judge his favour better than life, and his <hi>loves more than Wine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to engage your hearts to prefer the kiſſes of God before a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other good things, with which the hand of his providence can make you happy, there needs no more, than that you ſhould be truly poſſeſſed with the notion of your own wants, and rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the differences of good. He that knows how much more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent than the Body, the Soul of man is: will quickly underſtand that thoſe things which are proportioned to its wants, are more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable goods than thoſe which are only ſuted to our more outward concerns. Study but the excellency of the love of God, and the vanity, and Earthlineſs of the Creature, the ſtate of your ſouls by nature, and with reſpect to that guilt, which by multitudes of Sins you have contracted, from which nothing can excuſe you but the blood of Chriſt, nor any thing evidence your abſolution (to quiet your accuſing, and condemning conſciences, but the <hi>kiſſes of his Mouth,</hi> and you will need no more to evince to you, that theſe coeleſtial kiſſes, are of all good things the moſt excellent, the moſt deſirable, which being well underſtood, the rational Soul directly moveth to a choice and deſire of them above, and before all other things.</p>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>According to the degree of their Emanation.</hi> God, whoſe heart is at all times the ſame towards his people, yet is pleaſed gradually to diſcover it, and to manifeſt himſelf unto his people. As the Sun in the Firmament (whoſe Light in it ſelf is alwaies the ſame, and which hath alwaies the ſame ability and aptitude to illuminate the Air, and to refreſh the Earth with its Beams, yet) gives out its Light variouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly according to its poſition in the Firmament, or aſpect upon the Hemiſphere, its nearneſs to, or diſtance from the Object to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened, or refreſhed, or as it is more or leſs hindered by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Clouds or Vapours; ſo doth the Sun of Righteouſneſs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo diffuſe his Beams variouſly. Or, as indeed a prudent Father, though at all times his heart be full of love to his Children, yet in the diſcoveries and manifeſtations of it, he governeth himſelf by his own prudence relating to the Child's good, and with reſpect to the Child's behaviour and demeanour towards him: So though whom God
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:61084:39"/>
loveth, he loveth with a great love, and to the end; yet as to the diſcoveries and manifeſtations of it, he governs himſelf by his own Infinite Wiſdom, and with a great reſpect, to his Peoples carriage and demeanour towards him. Hence it is, that though every Child of God, be beloved of God with the ſame <hi>ſpecial</hi> and <hi>diſtinguiſhing Love;</hi> yet every one lives not under the ſame <hi>manifeſtations</hi> and <hi>emanations</hi> of it: He ſheweth to ſome more, to ſome leſs, to ſome ſcarcely any, according to the Wiſdom of his Counſel, and the good pleaſure of his own will. One ſoul ſhall have juſt light enough to diſcern that the day is broke in his ſoul, that the Sun is ariſen with healing in his wings upon him; another ſhall hardly have ſo much light, as to diſcern that, but ſhall walk in the dark, and ſee no light. Another ſhall have the Sun of Righteouſneſs more fully ſhining up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and be able to ſay with <hi>Job, I know my Redeemer lives, and that I ſhall ſee him with theſe Eyes; and though Worms ſhall deſtroy this body, yet in my fleſh I ſhall ſee God:</hi> Or with <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 8. 38. <hi>I know, and am perſuaded, that neither life, nor death, nor any thing ſhall ſeparate me from the Love of God in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Yea the ſame ſoul ſhall ſometimes ſee its Beloved <hi>ſtanding</hi> as it were <hi>behind the wall,</hi> and <hi>looking in upon it</hi> through the <hi>Lattice;</hi> ſee him in a Glaſs darkly; another time it ſhall ſee him with a fuller ſight, as in the houſe with it, <hi>face to face.</hi> One while it ſhall only ſee as by a Wicket of hope open, and poſſibly but imperfectly open neither; another while its viſion ſhall be as it were of the <hi>Heavens opened,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt ſitting at the right hand of God,</hi> making interceſſion for it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The more or leſs of ſpecial and diſtinguiſhing grace</hi> is often mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured by the <hi>ſoul's apprehenſion,</hi> and <hi>particular fancy</hi> (which judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment poſſibly is not alwaies according to Truth, but yet ſuch as we ordinarily make.) Thus we commonly judge the <hi>comfortable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections of Divine Love,</hi> to be the greateſt tokens of it. The ſweeteſt indeed they are, but poſſibly the <hi>ſtrengthening Influences</hi> of Divine Grace, by which the ſoul is inabled to perform its ſpiritual duties, and to fight the good fight both againſt motions to ſin from within, and temptations to ſin from without, may be no leſs mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtations of ſpecial and diſtinguiſhing grace. But take your meaſures how you will, the gracious ſoul valueth at an high rate the leaſt manifeſtations of ſuch grace as may evidence to it that it is beloved of God with a ſpecial and diſtinguiſhing love. I do not ſay the leaſt of theſe will ſatisfie ſuch a ſoul: That it will not, for the ſoul in which God hath cauſed by his Spirit a ſpiritual thirſt after himſelf, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:61084:39"/>
crying out, <hi>Give, Give!</hi> The ſoul will not be ſatisfied, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til in the Reſurrection <hi>it awakes with God's likeneſs;</hi> but in the mean time, the leaſt influences of this nature, will be to it <hi>very precious and deſirable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The truth of this Propoſition will appear to you from the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions of ſeveral of the Servants of God in holy Writ, more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently thoſe which we read of concerning <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 4. 6. <hi>There be many that ſay, Who will ſhew us any good? Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>lift up the light of thy countenance upon me;</hi> and in the following words he declares, that it ſhould be more to him than the worldlings <hi>Harveſt</hi> or <hi>Vintage</hi> greater matter of gladneſs, than their increaſe of <hi>Corn, Wine,</hi> or <hi>Oil:</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84. 9. he asks no more than that the Lord would <hi>look upon the face of his Anointed.</hi> What can be leſs than <hi>Beholding,</hi> and giving the ſoul a <hi>good look?</hi> The liberty that the Birds of the Air, the <hi>Swallow</hi> and the <hi>Sparrow</hi> had, to make their, Neſts about the <hi>Lord's Altars,</hi> one would think argued but a ſmall favour; yet <hi>David</hi> prefers their condition before his. One would think the Office of a <hi>Door-keeper in the Lord's Houſe,</hi> were but a ſmall preferment; yet <hi>David</hi> valueth it above a <hi>Manſion in the Tents of wickedneſs.</hi> The ſeveral expreſſions which <hi>David</hi> maketh uſe of in the Pſalms, to teſtifie his deſires after God, ſuch as <hi>Behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Looking</hi> upon him, <hi>Remembring him,</hi> &amp;c. are all evident proofs of this. The Woman, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7. 38. counts it honour enough to ſit at Chriſt's feet, to waſh his feet with her tears, and then to <hi>wipe them with the hairs of her head.</hi> The Woman of <hi>Canaan</hi> is called a Dog, and contented with it, ſo ſhe may but lick up the <hi>Crumbs</hi> under her <hi>Maſter's Table.</hi> You read of another Woman that cried out; <hi>If I may but touch the Hem of his Garment.</hi> The Prophet <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariah</hi> foretold of a time when men ſhould <hi>take hold of the Skirt of a Jew, ſaying, We will go with you, for we have heard God is with you.</hi> Any thing of Chriſt is precious to a ſoul that hath once taſted how good he is. <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> muſt have his <hi>dead body;</hi> and the Diſciples muſt run to the <hi>Sepulchre</hi> where he was laid. The People of God of old had a favour for the duſt of <hi>Zion,</hi> and <hi>the ſtones thereof.</hi> But much more precious muſt the leaſt emanations of that virtue be which is in him ſuited to the wants (the ſpiritual wants of poor ſouls. What can be leſs than a look, a ſmile, a word? yet we find theſe have been very precious to the People of God.</p>
               <p>What can we think of leſs, than the hearing of a Prayer; yet <hi>David</hi> eſteemeth this ar an high rate, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116. 1, 2. For this he
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:61084:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
profeſſeth his <hi>love to God,</hi> and his reſolution to <hi>call upon him ſo long as he lived.</hi> One would think that of all other Fellowſhip and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Chriſt, a Fellowſhip with him in his <hi>Sufferings,</hi> were leaſt deſirable. St. <hi>Paul</hi> glorieth in this, and ſpeaks of it as a thing deſirable, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 10. <hi>ch.</hi> 3. 11. And we read of the Apoſtles prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing God, <hi>that they were thought worthy to ſuffer for the Name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The ſame Spirit that was in all theſe Servants of God, is yet to be found in the ſouls of ſuch as have any acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with, or relation to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.

It is his Love which their ſouls thirſt after; now the leaſt ſpecial token of Love ſheweth that he loves it, and his heart cleaveth to it.

The Chriſtian knows that <hi>Anima cujuſque eſt quiſque.</hi> The Soul of a Man is the Man: <hi>What ſhall it profit a Man, if he ſhould gain the whole world, and loſe his own Soul?</hi> The ſenſual Man values his life above thoſe things that are only good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their ſubſerviency to that. The rational man valueth his mind above his fleſh, and accordingly ſets a price upon <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>moral Virtue,</hi> above thoſe things that meerly gratify his ſenſe: The ſpiritual Man valueth his <hi>Soul,</hi> his Soul conſidered not only as a <hi>rational Being,</hi> but as a <hi>Spirit, an immortal Spirit,</hi> capable of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God, and an union and fellowſhip with him; and ordain'd to an eternal exiſtence, not only above his body, which he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth is made up of duſt, moulded up into fleſh, and blood, and bones. but above his mind. It really is of more value, and he is made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of it: hence he cannot but value the leaſt that tendeth to make that happy above any thing elſe whatſoever. Beſides, he knows himſelf created to an eternity, and believing that his reaſon teacheth him infinitely to prefer what is good for him, with reference to an happy exiſtence to eternity above any thing that can only ſerve him for the ſhort time he is to be clothed with fleſh, and to live in this world: This Election of the loves of Chriſt before all things elſe, and the value he puts upon the leaſt tokens, and manifeſtations of it, doth naturally and rationally follow his knowledge, convictions, and faith, and proceedeth upon the ſame reaſon, upon which any reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable creature valueth a greater and more comprehenſive good, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove what is of an inferiour vertue, and more inſignificant.</p>

I ſay it is not poſſible, that a Soul ſhould firmly, and ſteadily aſſent and agree to theſe things, but he muſt <hi>love Chriſt.</hi> But if you take <hi>believing</hi> in the ſecond ſenſe, as it ſignifieth <hi>the Souls receiving of him as its Lord, and Saviour,</hi> its reſting and relying upon him, and truſting him with all its Spiritual and Eternal Concerns, it is impoſſible but that the Soul ſhould have a love for him above all created Objects, and having ſo, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but naturally deſire to be mutually beloved, and be paſſionately deſirous of ſome evidences of it, and the leaſt evidences of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocations of love on his part, who is ſo exceeding dear in the Eyes of the Soul, muſt needs be exceedingly deſirable to, and valuable by that Soul.</p>

The reaſon lies in the high opinion which he hath of his own worth and merit; but the humble man puts a value upon the leaſt kindneſs; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath a low and mean opinion of himſelf, ſo he looketh upon every thing as more than he could merit, or challenge. <hi>Naaman</hi> huffs when the Prophet ſends to him to go and waſh in the waters of <hi>Jordan,</hi> he expected the Prophet ſhould have come out and <hi>ſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked</hi> him, and he thought the Waters of <hi>Abana</hi> and <hi>Parphar,</hi> were as wholſome as thoſe of <hi>Jordan</hi> were.

                  <hi>precious, and more precious than the greateſt portions of the worlds goods.</hi> The workings of the Spirit of Chriſt within, and upon the Soul, ſubduing the will of Man to the will of God, mortifying our Members, and the deeds of the Body: Taking the affections off the Earth, and Earthly things, and fixing them on more ſublime, and ſpiritual objects; the giving of the Soul a good hope through grace, theſe are things which we uſually count ſome of the leaſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of ſpecial, and diſtinguiſhing love. Really they are great things (nothing of Chriſt is little) but we judge ordinarily accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to ſenſe) we ordinarily eſteem a ſenſe or aſſurance, or full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion of the love of God, a much greater thing than theſe. But now for a Soul to ſet an high price, and value upon theſe, to be more ſatisfied, more to triumph, and rejoice in the conqueſt of a luſt, the victory over a temptation, than in the conqueſt of all our Enemies: More to deſire that our hearts may be filled with love to God, deſires after God, delight in God, than to have our Barns fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with Corn, or our Purſes with Gold and Silver, this I take to be ſuch a difference between a Chriſtian indeed, and a Chriſtian in a meer Name, Title, and outward Profeſſion, as a Chriſtian may reſt in, when he is inquiring into his Soul for evidences of the truth of grace. Other manifeſtations of the love of God, may be deſired for our ſelves, and with a reſpect only to our ſelves, and the quiet relief and peace of our own Spirits; a Chriſtian can deſire theſe only for the glory of God. Try your ſelves therefore Chriſtians by this Touchſtone: An Hypocrite may deſire to know that his Sins are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, and that God would not impute Sin to his Soul, or that he would impute a righteouſneſs without works; an Hypocrite may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to live with God in glory, but theſe leſſer tokens of love he valueth not.</p>

But we muſt take heed that we be not like our little Children, whom we ſhall ſometimes ſee too much ſlighting, and undervaluing, and ready to throw away what good things they have, becauſe they want ſome particular thing, which they have a
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:61084:43"/>
mind to, which it may be, we that are their Parents do not ſee ſo proper for them, eſpecially under their preſent circumſtances. It was lawful for <hi>Rachel</hi> to wiſh for, to pray for Children, but ſhe ſinned in ſaying to her Husband, <hi>give me Children, or elſe I die. Hannah</hi> was much in the ſame error, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 8. weeping, not eating, and vexing her ſelf, becauſe ſhe had <hi>no Child,</hi> and in the mean time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting that God had given her an Husband, who was <hi>better to her than ten Sons.</hi> So it is lawful, nay the duty of a good Chriſtian to pray, to endeavour for the ſweeteſt and fulleſt manifeſtations of Gods love. But I have often thought, that though theſe be good things of a Spiritual nature, and ſo vaſtly differing from the good things of this life, yet in this they agree with them, that they muſt be asked <hi>with ſubmiſſion to the will of God,</hi> becauſe they are not <hi>de neceſſariis ad ſalutem,</hi> things that are neceſſary to life, and eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, but ſuch which a Soul may want without any breach of Gods Covenant with the Soul. 2. But for a Soul not only too paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately to deſire theſe things, which ſpeaketh its not ſubmitting to the will of God in his not diſpenſing them to it, but to <hi>over-look, deny, or undervalue all the tokens for good,</hi> which it hath received from God, meerly becauſe it hath not theſe, and to conclude that it hath nothing of Chriſts love; this is certainly what doth no become a Chriſtian. Certainly a Chriſtian ought as much to value himſelf upon thoſe emanations of grace, by which he is inabled to ſerve and honour God, as upon thoſe by which his Soul is rendred more at eaſe, more refreſhed and comforted. Every kiſs of Chriſt, every meaſure of ſpecial diſtinguiſhing love is, and ought to be precious to a believing Soul.</p>

alas the world is but like a <hi>brave glaſs,</hi> which whole is of ſome value, but if broken in pieces, the ſmall pieces of it are worth nothing.

Labour for faith of evidence, be like the Travellers to <hi>Zion</hi> (of which <hi>David</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth) <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84. <hi>that go from ſtrength to ſtrength,</hi> until they all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before the Lord in <hi>Zion.</hi> It may be a good queſtion ſometimes to ſatisfy a troubled doubting Soul, what is the <hi>Minimum quod ſic,</hi> the loweſt degree or meaſure of ſaving grace, but it is an ill hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring from a lazy wanton Soul.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, it calls loudly to us to <hi>thirſt after Heaven,</hi> where the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Soul ſhall be the <hi>Lambs Wife,</hi> and follow him whitherſoever he goes, and be bleſſed with the cleareſt viſion, and the fulleſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces of its beloved. Oh how pleaſant will the manſions of glory be to thoſe Souls, to whom the imperfect views that it hath had of Chriſt in this life have been ſo deſirable, while we are <hi>preſent in the Body,</hi> even <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf owneth himſelf <hi>abſent from the Lord.</hi> Now indeed we are the Sons of God, now we are in a capacity of his kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, tokens of ſpecial love, ſufficient to uphold and refreſh our Souls, but there we ſhall be at the rivers of pleaſures, where there is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaſure, but fulneſs of pleaſures, and that for evermore. O Bleſſed are they that ſhall be alwaies before the Throne of God, ſeeing their Redeemer with thoſe Eyes, and taking their fills of his love.</p>

                  <hi>Grace</hi> is a thing which is but one piece conſidered as it is in God, their's nothing <hi>plural</hi> in the one Divine Being; but as the <hi>Sea,</hi> which is in itſelf but one, yet as it waſheth upon ſeveral coaſts, receiveth ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral names and denominations, as the <hi>Engliſh Sea,</hi> the <hi>Iriſh Sea,</hi> and the <hi>Baltick Sea:</hi> So as the Grace of God reſpecteth the ſeveral ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, and wants of us neceſſitous Creatures, it alſo obtaineth ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral names, and admits of ſeveral <hi>diſtinctions,</hi> and is ſhewed by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Acts.</hi> The <hi>Grace of God</hi> in the ſenſe I am now ſpeaking to, it ſignifyeth nothing but the <hi>free love of God looking upon the Sons of Men with reſpect to the ſeveral neceſſities of their Souls.</hi> Its <hi>varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> ariſeth from us, and our neceſſities, it is not divided in the <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:61084:45"/>
only in the <hi>ſtream,</hi> and thus <hi>Grace</hi> admits of ſeveral diſtinctions, which I ſhall open to you in a few words, that you may rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the various notions of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1.</note> The moſt famous diſtinction of it is into <hi>that which doth ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Soul acceptable to God,</hi> and that which is love, <hi>and freely gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but doth not make the Soul acceptable in Gods ſight,</hi> at leaſt not firſt acceptable, or is not that for which God doth at firſt <hi>accept the Soul.</hi> The firſt is that which we call the <hi>Grace of Juſtification,</hi> which is the <hi>free love of God</hi> ſhining upon the Soul, imputing to it <hi>a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs without works,</hi> and <hi>not imputing tranſgreſſion</hi> (as the Apoſtle expoundeth it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 6. 8.) the <hi>ſecond</hi> we call the grace of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation</hi> and <hi>Sanctification,</hi> which is the love of God freely ſhewed to the Soul, by which its heart is renewed and changed, and filled with new habits, and diſpoſitions, inclining and inabling it to what God requireth of it. This is <hi>Grace,</hi> it is from the power, and free love of God, though it be not that grace, for which God at firſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth the Soul (as the Papiſts ſay.)</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2.</note> This Grace of <hi>Regeneration</hi> and <hi>Sanctification,</hi> is alſo uſually diſtinguiſhed into <hi>Habitual</hi> and <hi>Actual. Habitual Grace</hi> is nothing elſe but the free love of God ſhining upon the Soul, <hi>inabling it to will,</hi> and to chooſe the things that are good, and pleaſing to God, <hi>he giveth to will</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle,) and we are made <hi>willing in the day of his power</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) <hi>Actual or acting Grace,</hi> which is the love of God ſhewed to the Soul in inabling us to do the things that are good, for as it is he that giveth <hi>to will,</hi> ſo it is he <hi>who giveth to do,</hi> both <hi>of his own good pleaſure;</hi> and our Lord told his Diſciples. <hi>John</hi> 15. 3. <hi>Without me you can do nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">3.</note> There is another diſtinction of Grace into <hi>Preventing</hi> and <hi>Subſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent.</hi> Preventing Grace is that love of God which <hi>preventeth,</hi> and goeth before any good motions, or actions of ours, according to that of the Prophet, <hi>I was found of them that ſought me not, and of thoſe that did not inquire after me.</hi> This is uſually called the <hi>firſt grace. Subſequent grace</hi> is that love of God which followeth this, and is variouſly manifeſted to the Souls of Gods People. In the firſt we are meerly <hi>paſſive,</hi> we only <hi>receive it:</hi> in the other we are <hi>active.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">4.</note> There are other notions of grace, but I ſhall inſtance only in one more. <hi>Special grace</hi> is the <hi>free love of God either concerning the being of a true Chriſtian,</hi> or 2dly, <hi>Concerning its well being.</hi> That grace which concerneth the being of a true Chriſtian, which quickneth the Soul which before was a Child of Wrath, <hi>dead in treſpaſſes and</hi>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:61084:46"/>
                  <hi>ſins,</hi> is either the <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>Juſtification,</hi> and what concerneth that; this is <hi>firſt grace,</hi> and <hi>preventing grace.</hi> Or, 2. The grace of <hi>Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> by which a new heart is given unto us, and we are inclined, diſpoſed, and inabled to the operations of a ſpiritual life. Or, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>What concerneth the better being of a Chriſtian in the mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of all the actions, and concerns of the ſpiritual life.</hi> This again is divided into <hi>quickning grace, ſtrengthening Grace, and conſolatory</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1.</note> 
                  <hi>Grace.</hi> 1. <hi>Quickning grace</hi> may either ſignify that love of God, by which our Spiritual powers, habits, and inclinations are drawn out into acts. 2. <hi>Or that whereby a Soul is made more active and lively, and free in the ſervice of God,</hi> which removes thoſe difficulties, that heavineſs, and deadneſs, and dulneſs, which we often find upon our Souls as to ſpiritual things. For this you read <hi>David</hi> ſo often praying in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                  <hi>Strengthening grace,</hi> which is the love of God ſhewed to the Soul in further <hi>inabling</hi> it both to its ſpiritual actions, and to the managing of the good fight againſt <hi>the World, the Fleſh and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil;</hi> the Apoſtle calleth it a being <hi>ſtrengthened with might in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Man;</hi> of this Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 13. <hi>I can do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengtheneth me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                  <hi>Conſolatory grace,</hi> which ſignifieth <hi>the love of God ſhining upon the Soul, that is ſad, and heavy,</hi> refreſhing it either from the view, and ſenſe of the truth of its gracious habits, or from the ſealings of ſome promiſe, giving the Soul an aſſurance, or full perſuaſion of the love of God. <hi>David</hi> crieth out, <hi>when wilt thou comfort me?</hi> Thus you ſee the variety of gracious diſpenſations, the love of God is one as it is in him as the fountain, but it divideth itſelf into ſeveral ſtreams, as it ſhineth upon divers Souls, or the ſame Soul oft-times in differing circumſtances, or with reſpect to divers wants which our Souls have.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As there is variety in the diſpenſations of grace, ſo <hi>grace</hi> diſcovers itſelf in various <hi>acts.</hi> Divines ſay that the <hi>grace</hi> of <hi>Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> ſo far as it reſpecteth the <hi>Souls State,</hi> varieth not. Nor is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, but the acts of grace referring to our juſtified eſtate, they are repeated. God doth not pardon ſin before it is committed, but repeateth his gracious act in pardoning, as the Soul repeateth its tranſgreſſions.</p>
               <p>Now this is that which I ſay in this propoſition, that the Spouſe of Chriſt, the truly gracious Soul is not ſatisfied with any ſingle diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of grace, nor with a ſingle act, it deſires not only the <hi>firſt grace,</hi> but <hi>further grace,</hi> not only the <hi>grace of Juſtification,</hi> but the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:61084:46"/>
                  <hi>grace of regeneration</hi> alſo, not only <hi>gracious habits,</hi> but that it may be <hi>excited,</hi> and <hi>quickned</hi> to <hi>ſpiritual actions,</hi> not only that it may <hi>do them,</hi> but that it may do them with ſome <hi>ſtrength</hi> and <hi>vigour,</hi> with ſome life, and chearfulneſs, it deſires renewed acts of pardon, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed influences of ſpiritual ſtrength and life. Let us but a little ſee it in the great inſtance of <hi>David</hi> the man according to Gods own heart, we ſhall find him ſpeaking to our purpoſe in ſeveral <hi>Pſalms,</hi> Pſal. 19. 13. <hi>Cleanſe thou me from ſecret faults,</hi> there he beggeth for <hi>pardoning love,</hi> will this ſatisfy this holy man? will he think it enough if God pardoneth his Sin? ſee what followeth in that <hi>Pſalm; Keep back thy Servant from preſumptuous ſins, let them not have dominion over me;</hi> he muſt have ſtrengthening as well as pardoning grace, he deſires to be freed from the <hi>commanding,</hi> as well as from the <hi>condemning power of Sins.</hi> Look into the 51 <hi>Pſalm</hi> (a Pſalm much ſpent in petitions for <hi>ſpecial grace)</hi> v. 7. He prays for <hi>pardon. Purge me with hyſſop and I ſhall be clean, waſh me and I ſhall be whiter than the Snow,</hi> he ſpeaks in an old Teſtament phraſe, with reference to the <hi>Levitical</hi> rites. Chriſt ſpeaketh to <hi>Peter, Joh.</hi> 13. much in the ſame dialect, <hi>Except I waſh thee, thou canſt have no part in me.</hi> But the meaning is pardon me, remove the guilt of my ſin from me; but is this enough for this holy Man? Is this all that he asketh of God. No, <hi>v.</hi> 8. <hi>Make me to hear the voice of Joy and Gladneſs, that the Bones which thou haſt broken may rejoice.</hi> There he prayeth for <hi>Conſolatory Grace:</hi> Well, will this yet ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the thirſt of this holy Man? No, he muſt alſo have a <hi>renewed Heart,</hi> a right <hi>Spirit.</hi> The Spirit of God reſting upon him, dwelling &amp; abiding in him: A right Heart as well as a righteous Heart, <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>Create in me a clean Heart, O God, and renew a right Spirit within me.</hi> v. 11, 12. <hi>Take not thy holy Spirit from me. Uphold me with thy free Spirit.</hi> He muſt not only be ſet right in Gods way, but he muſt be kept right, and upheld in it. Look upon him in that 119 Pſalm, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 28. <hi>Strengthen me according to thy Word.</hi> The Lord had given him the <hi>Pardon of his Sin,</hi> he had given him <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> ſo as he tells us in that Pſalm, he was become <hi>wiſer than his Teachers.</hi> God had ſanctified Affliction to him, ſo as by it <hi>he had learned to keep Gods Statutes.</hi> The Lord had given him an heart to <hi>love his Law,</hi> to make it his <hi>Meditation night and day,</hi> yet he cries, <hi>Strengthen me O Lord:</hi> And again, <hi>v.</hi> 25. <hi>Quicken me in thy way, Quicken me after thy Loving-kindneſs.</hi> v. 4. <hi>O Quicken me in thy Righteouſneſs.</hi> Hath he enough yet? No; one thing he yet wants, <hi>v.</hi> 42. <hi>Mine Eyes</hi>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:61084:47"/>
                  <hi>fail for thy Word, when wilt thou comfort me?</hi> There is hardly any Diſpenſation of Grace which we do not find <hi>David</hi> in that Pſalm pleading with God for. This one inſtance of <hi>David</hi> is enough to ſhew you the temper of every Soul, which hath but once taſted how good the Lord is. Nor indeed can it be otherwiſe:</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1.</note> If we conſider <hi>the Beauty and excellency which appeareth to ſuch a Soul in every Diſpenſation of Grace.</hi> The Spouſe ſaith of Chriſt in another part of this Song, <hi>He is altogether lovely.</hi> There is no part of Chriſt which is not in itſelf lovely; he is <hi>the brightneſs of his Fathers Glory, the fulneſs of the God Head dwells in him bodily:</hi> As every Beam of the Sun, every Emanation of that Body of Light is lovely to him whoſe Eyes are open to diſcern it: So every Beam of the Sun of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, every Emanation of his Love muſt neceſſarily be lovely to the Soul that hath its ſenſes exerciſed to diſcern betwixt good and evil. All Beauty is attractive; whatſoever appeareth to our Souls lovely and beautiful, appeareth alſo deſirable. But this is not all, though Beauty and Comelineſs be attractive, and allures our Souls into an earneſt deſire after it, yet profit is more.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2.</note> Secondly, <hi>There is no Diſpenſation of Divine Grace, but ſuiteth ſome great want of the Soul.</hi> It is the ſame Reaſon that I gave you why the <hi>leaſt of Chriſt is</hi> ſo <hi>pretious:</hi> Becauſe the leaſt of his Grace is ſuited to ſome great want of our Souls. What I there applied to the <hi>leaſt of his Love,</hi> I here apply to the varieties of his gracious diſpenſations, and indeed reaſonably; for there would be no variety in <hi>grace,</hi> if there were not a variety of <hi>defects and wants, and empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes</hi> in our Souls; that which diſtinguiſheth divine grace, is our <hi>various wants and neceſſities,</hi> and we can as naturally not deſire a ſupply for our own diſcerned defects and wants, as we cannot deſire various emanations of divine love, ſuited to the ſupply of them. Nature prompteth us to deſire a ſupply for every craving of our Souls. The Soul is ſenſible that it daily ſinneth, and cannot but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire <hi>pardoning grace,</hi> and ſay unto God every day, <hi>Forgive us our debts;</hi> it is ſenſible, that it wants <hi>purity and holineſs,</hi> and therefore cannot but deſire a <hi>right Spirit.</hi> Its wants are many, and it therefore deſireth various diſpenſations of grace to ſupply them; they are <hi>daily renewing,</hi> therefore it deſires <hi>repeated acts</hi> of grace to be renewed alſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">3.</note> A third reaſon lyeth in the <hi>Concatenation of grace.</hi> The Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher ſaith, <hi>Virtutes ſunt Concatenatae,</hi> that all vertues are chained to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and no man is truly virtuous, but hath in him the habits of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:61084:47"/>
all Virtue, they make Virtue to lie in the reduction of the whole Soul, to the rule, guidance, and conduct of reaſon. I am ſure <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae ſunt concatenatae,</hi> the Graces of Gods Spirit, are like Pearl ſtring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together, and that upon a double account: 1. With <hi>reſpect to themſelves.</hi> 2. With <hi>reſpect to our ſenſe, and apprehenſion. Pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning grace</hi> never goeth without <hi>renewing and regenerating grace.</hi> God never ſaith to any Soul. <hi>Thy Sins are forgiven,</hi> but he addeth, <hi>ſin no more.</hi> The <hi>Grace of Conſolation</hi> never goeth without the Grace of <hi>Sanctification.</hi> The <hi>Grace of Regeneration</hi> is alwaies attended with ſome degrees of that Grace which <hi>ſtrengtheneth,</hi> and <hi>quickneth</hi> the Soul unto its <hi>Spiritual work and duty.</hi> 2. As to our <hi>ſenſe of it.</hi> The Grace of God being as I have before ſaid, nothing elſe but the <hi>Love of God</hi> freely ſhining upon us, with reſpect to our ſeveral cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and diverſified wants; the Soul is prone from the want of a ſupply as to one thing to ſuſpect its want of all. Hence it is that it ſuſpecteth the want of the love of God in the whole, from its ſenſe of the want of it in part. Indeed this oft-times is the error of a Soul that is truly gracious, from its not diſtinguiſhing betwixt thoſe things that are neceſſary to <hi>Eternal life</hi> and <hi>Salvation,</hi> and thoſe influences that are meerly <hi>accommodating,</hi> and tending to the better being of the ſpiritual life, the diſpenſations of which are not meerly directed from the <hi>divine love,</hi> but from the <hi>divine wiſdom,</hi> and ſometimes are with-held from the wiſdom of God, by which he directeth his own motions to their ends. Hence as <hi>Gideon,</hi> when the Angel came to him, and ſaid, <hi>The Lord is with thee, O thou migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty man of valour,</hi> replyed. <hi>If the Lord be with us, why am I thus?</hi> So the Soul thirſting after the love of God, if any go about to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade it, under its ſadneſs, and dejections under the ſenſe of its weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as to ſpiritual duties, or dulneſs, and heavineſs in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of them, that yet the love of God is toward it, it hath a truth of Grace, it cries out, <hi>If God loved me, why am I thus?</hi> I am weak, why am I not ſtrengthened, or my Soul is dull, and dead, and heavy, why am I not quickned? Or I am ſad, and dejected, if God loved me, why am I not comforted? The Soul of a believer is apt to conceive, that becauſe <hi>Love</hi> is one in God, therefore it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> be a ſharer in his love, while it wants any one aſpect of it, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> might ſuite its ſpiritual wants.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">4.</note> Another reaſon may be, the <hi>poſſibility which the Soul, apprehends of obtaining all grace.</hi> Let a thing appear to us never ſo, beautiful, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo uſeful, yet if we lye under an apprehenſion of its impoſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:61084:48"/>
to obtain it, this moderateth its deſires after if;nay extinguiſheth them; for our Reaſon forbids our Wills to move after things which we apprehend not poſſible to be obtained: But ſuch is the goodneſs of God towards us, that there is no diſpenſation of his love, but he hath ſomewhere or other promiſed and revealed to us as poſſible to be obtained by us. Now good apprehended poſſible to be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by us, is the proper object of the deſires of our Souls, we are told, that <hi>it hath pleaſed the father, that in Chriſt all fulneſs ſhould dwell, And that the fulneſs of the God-Head dwelt in him bodily,</hi> 1 <hi>Col.</hi> 19. 2 <hi>Col.</hi> 12. <hi>and of his fulneſs</hi> (ſaith the Evangeliſt <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 16.) <hi>We have all received grace for grace.</hi> To paſs by other inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations of that <gap reason="foreign">

There is no love of God to Chriſt, which fitteth us, or may fit us in our proportions, but we may receive. <hi>Nay there is no love of God which floweth from the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Divine Nature,</hi> of which we are capable, but <hi>the believer may receive.</hi> For ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>the Fulneſs of the God-Head dwelt in him</hi>

It will be an hard thing for you to ſatisfy your Souls in the having any truth of Grace, if you find not your Souls thirſting after every manifeſtation of it. There is no influence of Grace, but is poſſible to be obtained. There is a fulneſs of the God-Head in Chriſt conſidered as your Mediator, and he is therefore full, that we might drink abundantly of his fulneſs, but to all theſe before enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon, I ſhall add two.</p>

                  <hi>It is an evidence of true Grace to be thirſty after all Grace.</hi> That Soul loveth not Chriſt truly that doth not deſire that he ſhould love it fully.

                  <hi>Reading</hi> is one means by which we come to the knowledg of the will of God in his Word. <hi>The King of Iſrael</hi> was commanded <hi>to read</hi> in <hi>the Book of Gods Law all the days of his life, that he might learn to keep the Law of his God,</hi> and there is a bleſſing pronounced <hi>to him that readeth.</hi> Indeed he that readeth the word as it lyeth before us in our Bibles hath this advantage, that he is ſure what is there plain to his underſtanding, is the undoubted, pure Word of God; and while a man readeth the Scriptures he is but repeating of Gods Word to his own ſoul, or hearing God immediately ſpeaking to him.</p>

                  <hi>Hearing the word preached is another means of communion with God in his Word.</hi> This is an Ordinance of God, and ſuch a one, as he honoureth with being the great means of calling, and ſaving ſuch as he hath ordained to life: So as in that ordinance a ſoul hath an opportunity to <hi>meet God,</hi> to <hi>draw nigh unto</hi> him, to <hi>hear him ſpeak unto it.</hi> We muſt take heed that we do not think, that all which we hear out of pulpits is ſpoken by God; God no further ſpeaketh by the Miniſter, than the Miniſter keepeth unto his Text, &amp; ſpeaketh accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> either by way of <hi>interpretation,</hi> or <hi>application.</hi> And therefore every good Chriſtian, is to <hi>ſearch the Scriptures</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what their Preachers deliver be conſonant to them.

                  <hi>good will, and love of God to poor loſt Sinners declared in, and through Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> You have an hiſtorical part of the Goſpel, declaring what Chriſt hath done, and Suffered for us, a declarative and promiſſory part, proclaiming Salvation to poor loſt creatures, and promiſing life and Salvation, and all grace to ſome poor undone ſinners, promiſes for the conferring, and increaſe of grace. Theſe and ſuch like, I principally underſtand by <hi>Goſpel Doctrines.</hi> The Doctrine of Gods free grace in the pardoning of ſin, and the <hi>imputation of Chriſts Righteouſneſs</hi> to the ſoul. Doctrines that reveal Chriſt and tend to bring the ſoul to Chriſt, or direct the ſoul in walking with him. Now I ſay tho the believing ſoul values every line of holy Writ, and hath a reverence for the whole Word of God, and deſires a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God in reading, and hearing and meditating in every part of his revealed will, yet it hath a ſpecial thirſt after thoſe portions of it which contain theſe Revelations: Other parts are ſweet but theſe are ſweeter than the <hi>Hony</hi> and the <hi>Hony-comb.</hi> No portions of Scripture are like theſe to the believer. Every verſe in the book of God is a Star but as Stars differ one from another in glory, ſo do the Revelations of the will of God in our apprehenſionsa, s more ſuited to our neceſſities. For the proof of the propoſition: There is ſo much reaſon for it, that were it not that it is fit your <hi>Faith</hi> (for the help of which the Miniſtry is ordained) ſhould not ſtand in the wiſdom of men but in the power of God, I might for bear the uſe of any Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture texts in the caſe. The World was many hundred years old be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there was any written Word of God, (of which we have any record.) The firſt that we read of was <hi>the Book of the Law</hi> which the <hi>King of Iſrael</hi> was commanded to have alwayes before him and to <hi>read therein all the daies of his life. Saul</hi> was the firſt <hi>King of Iſrael;</hi> he was a wicked man and regarded not the <hi>divine Law.</hi> The next was <hi>David</hi> (the man according to Gods own heart.) See his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to the word Superlatively expreſt <hi>Pſal</hi> 19. 7, 8, 9, 10. 11. <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect converting the ſoul, the Teſtimony of the Lord is ſure making wiſe the ſimple, the Statutes of the Lord are right rejoicing the heart, the Commandment of the Lord is pure enli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghtening the Eyes. The Judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether; more to be deſired are they than gold, yea than much fine gold, ſweeter alſo than the hony and the Hony-comb.</hi> Pſal. 119. 14, 15, 16. <hi>I have rejoiced in the way of thy teſtimonies, as much as in all riches, I will meditate in thy precepts and have reſpect unto thy ways, I will delight my ſelf in thy ſtatutes,</hi> v. 97. <hi>Oh! how I love thy law, it is my</hi>

I had</hi> (ſaith he in one paſſage) <hi>periſhed in my affliction, if thy Word had not been my delight.</hi> For the Word of God as delivered by Miniſters, you ſhall all along the Hiſtory of the Scripture obſerve, you read not of one good <hi>King of Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but they were very deſircus in all caſes of conſulting with the <hi>Prophets of the Lord;</hi> and no doubt but the reading the Law, and the Expoſition of it in the Sanctuary, was the reaſon why <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 42. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63. and <hi>Pſal</hi> 84 ſo paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately bewailed his being baniſhed from it.

The Soul in this doth but conform himſelf to an impreſſion that is made by the Spirit upon his heart, and is coaevous to the hour of his New Birth; and this you ſhall ſee exemplified not in this or that particular Soul, but in every Soul born of God. The Infant is not more naturally diſpoſed to ſuck the breaſts of the Mother or Nurſe, than ſuch a Soul is diſpoſed to read, and hear the Word of God from the impreſſion of the holy Spirit of God upon it in the firſt hour of its Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>

Nay, it is not only neceſſary to uphold the Spiritual Being of the the Soul, but to all the purpoſes of its well-being.

There are many Souls that were dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, and by the Word were brought to life; many Souls that were dropping into the bottomleſs Pit, whom the Word laid hold upon, and ſaved from it. Here's a broken heart, that was bound up by ſome lines of holy Writ. There's a tempted Soul fetcht out of the depths of Satan by a Promiſe in the Word. There hangs a poor fearful doubting Soul reſolved by it, and brought to a ſettled ſtate. The Regenerate Soul meets with theſe Stories in all its new com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. And</p>

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:61084:55"/>
hence they almoſt hate a <hi>Book</hi> or any thing which may have any tendency to adorn and any way ennoble the mind of man. 2. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have ſome delight in knowledge, but it is an airy knowledge of things that are ſuperfluous, and ſignify nothing as to the uſe of mans life, a knowledge of things only which pleaſe the fancy, tickle the ſenſes, furniſh the tongue with diſcourſe for all humors and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies. <hi>Romances</hi> and <hi>Play Books,</hi> any Books of idle <hi>diſcourſe,</hi> and <hi>fooliſh ſtories</hi> pleaſe them, but for the knowledge of ſuch things, as ſhould ennoble their minds, they have no fancy for it nor any Books, or diſcourſes that have any tendency to ſuch an end; theſe are a ſort of titular Chriſtians that are not yet come up to the higheſt forms of Heathens. 3. There is a third ſort of more <hi>noble Souls</hi> that love <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and deſpiſe vain and airy <hi>knowledge,</hi> that iſlueth in no good and worthy end as to mans life; but ſeek ſuch a knowledge, as may make them <hi>wife</hi> to the rational ends of the life of man. You ſhall now never find theſe men much employing themſelves with reading or hearing of Playes, or reading <hi>Romances,</hi> they abhor the feeding of their Souls with Coals, and Dirt, and cheating themſelves with lies and falſhoods, nor debauching their minds with ſordid and ſilthy Books and diſcourſes, they will be reading Books of <hi>H ſtory</hi> and <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> which may ſerve their Souls as to the moſt noble ends or life; and indeed ſuch as are come thus far, are yet but come on to the higheſt forms of good Pagans. But the good Chriſtian is got beyond theſe, he hath diſcerned that God is the greateſt good, and the fruition and enjoyment of God is the fruition of the greateſt good, and that the enjoyment of God, an acquaintance, fellowſhip, and communion with him, is more to be deſired than all the world beſides. Whatſoever Books or diſcourſes therefore have either in their own nature, or by any ordination of God, a tendency to bring the Soul of Man to a knowledge of God, to an acquaintance or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God appear to him the beſt Books, the beſt diſcourſes in the world, and this he doth by as rational an operation of his Soul, as a ſober Man counteth a true Hiſtory better than a <hi>Romance,</hi> or a Lecture of <hi>Moral</hi> or <hi>Natural Philoſophy</hi> better than a <hi>Play,</hi> or an <hi>

words, and full of filthy, or at beſt witty diſcourſes, as the beſt Book to ſpend his time in, and diſcourſes to ſpend his time upon. It is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the moral Man hath fixed upon the ennobling his mind with human knowledge, and habits of moral vertue, that he deſpiſeth thoſe things before-mentioned, as contrary to his deſign, and the main end of his life, and chuſeth rather the moral writings of <hi>Seneca, Ariſtotle, Plato,</hi> &amp;c. than any other idle Books to ſpend his thoughts upon. And it is becauſe the true Chriſtian hath fixed upon the glorifying of God, and the ſaving of his own Soul, as the great end of his life that he thirſteth after, and hath ſuch a delight in the World of God, and the <hi>Interpretation</hi> and <hi>application</hi> of that (which is that which we call Preaching.) 2. Beſides, the Philoſopher obſerveth, that <hi>like delighteth in its like.</hi> Look what complexion the Soul is of, ſuch things it deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, thirſteth after, and delighteth in. Hence the dirty filthy Soul, where ſenſe, and paſſion, and corrupt and debauched affections pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominate, covets filthy Books, and filthy diſcourſes, which are but the iſſues of Souls of the ſame complexion with itſelf, the Soul that is ſomething cleaner, and hath got its paſſions ſomething more ſubju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated unto its reaſon; delighteth in, and deſireth Books and diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of its own complexion, and which are the iſſues of Souls like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to itſelf. The Spiritual Man being refined to a further degree and pirch, minding the glory of God, and Spiritual things, hath a thirſt after the Word, and Sermons which are the true and faithful Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations, &amp; applications of that word, as being more pure and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, and ſo more like to it in its <hi>renewed State,</hi> wherein we are <hi>transformed</hi> into the likeneſs of the word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

In the law and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive part of Holy Writ, and the threatnings of Holy Scripture, he tells them their duty, what is his will they ſhould do, and avoid, and what he will do unto them in caſe they be diſobedient to his Commandments, and do not walk in his <hi>Statutes,</hi> and keep his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. In the prophetical part of it, ſo far as it is but an Hiſtory of what God hath ſaid and done, he confirms them in their apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and faith of Gods knowledge of future contingencies, and alſo concerning his faithfulneſs. But it is in the Doctrines of the Goſpel alone, that he declareth his love to poor Souls in and through the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, what Chriſt hath done and ſuffered for the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſalvation of Man, what he is yet ready to do for all ſuch, as truly repent and believe, and accept of the Mediator. It is in that alone that he offers healing to the Nations; now every gracious Soul being one who muſt be ſuppoſed to have felt ſomething of the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of Sin, and the wrath of God due to Man for Sin, it is no wonder if the ſpecial thirſt of ſuch a Soul be after the revelations of Chriſt in the Doctrines of the Goſpel, as being moſt ſuited to the ſtate of a Soul that is weary, and heavy laden, and ſeeking for reſt, and being wearied in its own indeavours, and finding none. No wonder if ſuch Sermons, ſuch Preaching, be moſt ſweet and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table unto it, if ſuch portions of Scripture, ſuch diſcourſes from Scripture be moſt acceptable, and grateful to it's thoughts, and moſt ſweet to its meditations, as being ſuch which muſt deliver it from the trouble, and uneaſineſs, which the Law which worketh wrath hath given to it, finding itſelf a great tranſgreſſor of it. Thus I have doctrinally diſcourſed, the hunger of the Soul after the Word of God, and a communion with God in it by <hi>reading, hearing,</hi> or <hi>medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> and the reaſonableneſs of this appetite of the Soul to it. There is yet a more excellent, internal communion of the Souls communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God in his Word, which infinitely excelleth this, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently is the more ſpecial object of the renewed Souls Spiritual hunger, and thirſt, to which I ſhall ſpeak. But I ſhall firſt make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of this diſcourſe.</p>

                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. This Notion may help us to take ſome meaſures of our

                  <hi>Spiritual State,</hi> whether we be the <hi>Spouſes</hi> of Chriſt yea or no, the Souls deſires, or no deſires after <hi>communion</hi> with God in his Word; its <hi>delight</hi> or no <hi>delight</hi> in that piece of communion with God, will go a great way to determine our Spiritual State, and how it ſhall fare with us in the day of Judgment. I am ſure <hi>negatively</hi> it is a good note. <hi>He that hath no deſire after, no delight in the Word of God hath nothing of God, or Chriſt in him.</hi> And this is evident from all <hi>Scripture experience,</hi> and reaſon alſo. <hi>Davids</hi> experience is inſtead of all, though many more examples might be produced out of Holy Writ. There was never any good King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> or <hi>Judah</hi> but call'd for the Law of the Lord, and much deſired and delighted in the Lords Prophets. It is impoſſible that the Word ſhould have done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Soul good, and the ſavour of it not be left upon it, engaging it to prize and value it ſo long as it lives. I only except an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hour of temptation, in which I have known good Souls, afraid to read, and hear, but alas they are at that time not themſelves, and act not from a free uſe of their reaſon. This reflects ſadly,</p>

But alas: how many can read, that hardly take the Bible in their Hands from one end of the week to the other, Surely we may conclude the Bible never did their Souls good. They cannot but have heard, that the Lord commanded the King of his People to read in the Book of the Law all the daies of his life. And by Gods order was read in the Synagogues every Sabbath Day; and can any think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf excuſed from reading the word? we cannot be alwaies hearing, nor doth ſo much knowledge come into our Souls by hearing as may by reading. Am I in none of your boſoms? Is there not amongſt ſome of you a ſad neglect of Reading the Scripture? Let me tell you it ſpeaks you to have taſted very little, if at all, how good the Lord is.</p>

               <p>I ſhall ſhut up this Diſcourſe with a word of Exhortation: Which of us is there who hath not an ambition to be the <hi>Lamb's Wife,</hi> and to be thought the <hi>Spouſe of Chriſt?</hi> Evidence then your ſelves to be ſuch by your hunger after a communion with God in his Word, by your much Reading, much Hearing, by your meditating in the Law of the Lord night and day. For the written Word, you have no plea to the contrary, no excuſe for the Word Preached; I wiſh Chriſtians had more general incouragement. We have too much of of the word of man in Pulpits, too little of the Word of God; and as it is in Trade, the falſe and corrupt making of Wares, depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiates the Commodity, and brings it out of eſteem with ſuch as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor to be cheated: So the abundance of falſe Preaching, by which I mean, not only Preaching of unſound Notions, but Preaching vain Philoſophy, idle Speculations, turning Sermons into Harangues of Oratory: In ſhort, whatſoever is not intelligible Scriptural Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with a true deſign to ſhew men the way of Salvation, and to direct them into it, and in it: I call this falſe Preaching: We have ſo much of this, that it hath brought a diſcredit upon the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. I would have you, as our Saviour directs, <hi>Take heed what you hear, and how you hear,</hi> and that will oblige you to <hi>take heed whom you hear.</hi> But withal, <hi>Take heed that you hear;</hi> for God hath told you, that <hi>Faith cometh by hearing:</hi> He hath ſaid, <hi>Hear, and your Souls ſhall live:</hi> And bleſſed be God he hath not left us without ſome that Preach Jeſus Chriſt and him crucified, and deſire to know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe amongſt people. I cannot tell you <hi>how long you ſhall have any of the daies of the Son of Man;</hi> work while it is day; when the night comes no man can work. We have had faithful, powerful Preaching a long time, (poſſibly Chriſt never had a Church on Earth, had ſuch handling the Word of God ſo long a time) doth not the Candle begin to fail, and burn in the Socket? We have an <hi>Ezra</hi>'s Temple, but is not <hi>Solomon</hi>'s deſtroyed? 2. There's no ſuch way to recover your Light, and keep it with you, as to cry after it, and to make uſe of it while you have it. God will not take away his Word from hungry Children. Where are our <hi>Rogers, Sheppard, Hooker, Fenner, Preſton, Sibbs, Burroughs, and others?</hi> It's time to recover your Appetites, that you may recover your Bread. 3. <hi>Conſider, you that love the Lord,</hi> will be <hi>the firſt that want it.</hi> Prodigals of their Souls, can feed upon any Husks, though

               <p>This is a Point not ſo well generally underſtood by the croud of Profeſſors; ſuffer me therefore to ſpend a few words in the Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of it.</p>
               <p>All <hi>Communion</hi> importeth mutual and reciprocal Communication.
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:61084:58"/>
It is an action wherein two Perſons do communicate themſelves each to other, <hi>Communion with God,</hi> implieth God's communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of himſelf to his creature, and the creature's communication of it ſelf unto God. To reſtrain my diſcourſe to the preſent Subject I am about; There is a more <hi>external Communion</hi> we have with God, with reference to his Word, in the <hi>reading it,</hi> or <hi>hearing it</hi> read or Preacht, or <hi>meditating</hi> in it. God then communicates his Will to us, by the help of Letters, Words and Syllables, by which we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand things, or by the <hi>voice</hi> of <hi>his Miniſters,</hi> ſent in his Name to open his mind and will unto us; and we communicate with God, giving him the homage of our Eyes and Ears, our common ſenſe and imaginations; this I call a more external Communion: And there is a more <hi>ſpiritual internal Communion,</hi> which a Soul hath with God in it. I call it a <hi>Communion,</hi> becauſe God in it doth <hi>communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate</hi> himſelf to the Soul, and the Soul <hi>communicateth it ſelf to God.</hi> God ſpeaketh by his Word <hi>to the heart,</hi> and the <hi>heart</hi> receiveth the Divine Impreſſions, and ſurrendreth up it ſelf to the Will of God. In the other there is no more than a communication of the <hi>Divine Will</hi> (on God's part) nor any more than the homage of our exterior ſenſes, our faculty of reading and hearing, the ſervice of our <hi>Eyes</hi> and <hi>Ears,</hi> our common ſenſe, and power of <hi>Imagination,</hi> and of our underſtanding receiving the notions of Truth. In this Communion with God in his Word, there is not only on God's part a communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>God's Will,</hi> but alſo of <hi>God's Power,</hi> by which the Soul is 1. <hi>Irradiated as to the underſtanding,</hi> inabled to ſee things in another light more fully and clearly 2. <hi>Subdued as to the Will,</hi> ſo as the man is made willing and obedient to the heavenly Revelation, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into the likeneſs of the Word, ſo convinced of the truth of it, that it can no longer withſtand it, whether it be a <hi>word of Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> which is the Object of our Faith; or a <hi>word of Reproof,</hi> for conviction of Sin, or a <hi>word of Conſolation,</hi> for refreſhing the Soul; the Soul can no longer deny, or diſpute, or doubt of the Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, no longer ſtand out againſt the Precept, no longer refuſe to be comforted. The Word of the Lord comes here to the inward part of the Soul. 2. There is a <hi>further Communication on man's part of himſelf to God.</hi> In the former Communion he only lends God his Eye to read his Will, his Ear to hear it, his imaginative power to think upon it, his <hi>Paſſive Intellect</hi> or Power to receive Notions of Truth. Here he <hi>communicates</hi> his whole Soul to God, his <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Affections,</hi> his whole Man. It is true, here God ſpeaks

firſt, we do only <hi>velle quum volumus, agere quum agimur</hi> (as <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> expreſſeth it) that is, we only will when we are made wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and act when we are firſt moved and acted. There are ſome who are great Patrons for the Power of Man's Will as to things ſpiritual, that would elude thoſe Texts about the <hi>Teachings of the Spirit,</hi> and the Teachings of the <hi>Anointing</hi> ſpoken of by St. <hi>John,</hi> by aſſerting, <hi>That there is ſuch a conſtant concomitancy of the holy Spirit with the Preaching of the Goſpel, that whoſoever will may be willing, and obedient, and believe, and repent, and be obedient.</hi> I ſhould hearken much to this Notion, if the Authors of it could give me a good account how it is then, that of two perſons hearing the ſame Sermon, and ſitting under the ſame miniſtration of the Spirit, one man only hears it, thinks upon it a little, and receiveth ſome no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it, to fit his Tongue with diſcourſe; another hath his heart changed by it, and transformed into the Image of God, and wholly changed as to his Will and Affections, and his whole Converſation. That it is ſo is demonſtrably true, I would know whence it is, unleſs they will make man <hi>a God unto himſelf;</hi> that is, the firſt cauſe of <hi>truly good and ſpiritual motions.</hi> Now this internal Communion with God in his Word, which in Scripture is called the <hi>Teaching of the Spirit,</hi> and the Teaching of the <hi>Anointing,</hi> being ſuch as few are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with, is little known in the world, and therefore ſome count it <hi>Canting,</hi> and ſo unwarily <hi>blaſpheme</hi> the Teacher, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not underſtand any thing elſe by it than <hi>Miniſterial Teaching.</hi> Others again can underſtand no <hi>Teaching of the Spirit in and by Ordinances,</hi> but dream that Souls under the Teachings of the Spirit, muſt live above Duties and Ordinances, and ſo turn it into meer <hi>Enthuſiaſm,</hi> immediate impreſſions (which they pretend to) from the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God. It may be therefore worth our while to underſtand it a little.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You read of it propheſied of old,</hi> Iſa. <hi>54. 17.</hi> That the Children of the Church ſhould be all taught of the Lord. <hi>You read in the New Teſtament of</hi> words which the Holy Ghoſt teacheth, <hi>1</hi> Cor. <hi>2. 14. Yea it teacheth us not words only, but things, 1</hi> John <hi>2. 27.</hi> But the Anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which you have received in him, abideth in you, and you need not that any man ſhould teach you; but as the ſame Anointing teacheth you all things, and is truth, and is no lye. <hi>Yea it was Chriſt's own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi> Joh. <hi>14. 26.</hi> But the Comforter, which the Father will ſend in my name, he ſhall teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance whatſoever you have heard from me. <hi>So as that there is a</hi> Teaching of

Whether this be concomitant with Miniſterial Teachings, and ſuperadded to them; which we maintain againſt thoſe who are for <hi>immediate Teachings</hi> in raptures, and by immediate impreſſions; <hi>or a thing ſeparate from them,</hi> and to which <hi>Miniſterial Teachings</hi> are rather hinderances than any furtherance; which is what we deny. For though we limit not the Holy One of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but ſay, that as he did of Old, thus teach his Prophets and Apoſtles; ſo he may by more immediate Impreſſions and Revelations, teach his People ſtill what they are to do, or to avoid. Yet we ſay, that the Book of Scripture being finiſhed and ſealed, no ſuch Revelations are by any to be expected; and if any man think he hath any ſuch Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, Revelations, or extraordinary Teachings, they muſt be proved by <hi>the Word,</hi> with which, if they do not agree, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed not from the holy Spirit of God, neither have they any Light in them. Secondly,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whether the <hi>Teachings of the Spirit</hi> be any thing more than <hi>Miniſterial Teachings</hi> in the Preachings of the Goſpel, which Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings have ſuch a conſtant preſence of the Spirit of Grace with them, that if a man will, he may with thoſe Aids and Aſſiſtances do what God requireth of him in order to his Eternal Salvation, and avoid what God would have him to avoid. We affirm they are, and that there is no ſuch power in the Will of Man, in the uſe of thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Aids and Aſſiſtances, and that there is a <hi>Teaching</hi> of the Spirit in the uſe of the Word, far beyond the power and virtue of the Word. The Object of this Teaching we make to be the <hi>Elect</hi> of God. Reprobates as well as choſen Veſſels, may be taught by the Miniſterial Teaching of the Word, and have that external Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God in his Word, which I before mentioned; but the Elect of God, and ſuch as ſhall be eternally ſaved only, know any thing of theſe Teachings; and to ſuch are reſtricted throughout all Scripture, in ſuch places as make any mention of them. The more <hi>immediate Object</hi> is the <hi>Underſtanding, Will</hi> and <hi>Affections.</hi> The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial Teaching reacheth the <hi>Eyes</hi> and <hi>Ears,</hi> and <hi>exteriour ſenſes,</hi> and thence cometh into the thoughts, and into the underſtanding more confuſedly and imperfectly; it reacheth not the more inward part of the Soul. The things of the Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 10, 12. are revealed to thoſe who have received the Spirit; <hi>V.</hi> 14. <hi>The Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral man receiveth not the things of the Spirit, nor can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi> I therefore call it an internal
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:61084:60"/>
ſpiritual Communion with God in his Word. But yet for the fuller underſtanding of this, it is reaſonable that I ſhould ſhew you how the <hi>Spirit</hi> Teacheth the Elect Soul in and by the Ordinance, that you may ſee and underſtand what there is more in this <hi>Spiritual Teaching,</hi> in this internal Communion with God in his Word and Ordinances, than in the meer <hi>Teaching of the Letter, meer Miniſterial Teaching</hi> ſeparated from this.</p>
               <p>I told you before theſe Teachings were not by <hi>immediate Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſms, Impreſſions,</hi> or <hi>Revelations</hi> of new things; for, <hi>I pray obſerve,</hi> there is a twofold <hi>Revelation;</hi> the one I may call <hi>A ſimple, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate firſt Revelation.</hi> Thus God of old taught the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> All Scripture was <hi>by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration from God,</hi> and holy men ſpake as they were inſpired by God. Thus God was pleaſed to teach the Guides of his Church, before the holy Scripture was written, at leaſt fully written, and a Curſe annexed (as a Seal to that Book) to them that ſhould add any thing to it. This is a Teaching ſome would be at, but what need of it, if the Scriptures (as the Apoſtle tells us) are <hi>able to make the man of God wiſe to ſalvation, furniſhed to every good work?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, There is another kind of <hi>Revelation,</hi> which we may for diſtinction ſake, call a <hi>compounded, mediate Revelation;</hi> it is the <hi>further Revelation</hi> of what God hath revealed in his Word; but we wanted a proper <hi>medium</hi> to ſee it in; we were blind and dark, and our Eyes ſtuck in the bark and ſurface of Scripture. Thus it is yet true, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 10. That God revealeth to his People by his Spirit, <hi>the deep things of God, the things which Eye hath not ſeen, nor hath Ear heard, nor can it enter into the Heart of man to conceive the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.</hi> But of this I ſhall ſpeak more by and by.</p>
               <p>That I may therefore give you (at leaſt) my apprehenſion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the due notion of the <hi>Spirit's Teaching,</hi> ſo as it ſhall not be confounded with bare <hi>Miniſterial Teachings,</hi> which I take to be a great debaſing of the notion of it, on the one hand, nor be made oppoſite to <hi>Miniſterial Teaching,</hi> and that made uſeleſs on the other hand: I ſhall ſhew you that in order to the Salvation of a Soul, there is a Teaching of the Spirit neceſſary added to, or over and above <hi>Miniſterial Teachings.</hi> I ſhall open it in four or five particulars.</p>

                  <note place="margin">1</note> 1. <hi>The Spirit teacheth by ſpecial Illumination.</hi> There is a common Illumination, which is the Effect of the Spirit alſo; but of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit working in a way of <hi>common grace,</hi> by which men receive the common notions of Religious Truths. There are two diſeaſes or
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:61084:60"/>
faults in the Soul of a Chriſtian, which hinder its learning ſpiritual things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt is, a <hi>liſtleſneſs, or indiſpoſition to learn or hear any thing of that nature.</hi> You may ſee this in mens ſlighting of the Word of God, till God hath wrought ſome ſaving work in their hearts, they have no mind to read the holy Scriptures, nor yet to hear them faithfully opened and applied: And could you but enter into peoples hearts (which yet you may know by what was the temper of your own hearts before God wrought a change on them) you would ſee this yet further confirmed unto you; this God in converſion removes; but this is not that which I have here to do with.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is beſides this a natural <hi>blindneſs</hi> and <hi>deafneſs,</hi> that a poor creature cannot ſee nor hear. In <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. 21. you find theſe words, <hi>Hear now this O you fooliſh people, and void of underſtanding, who have Eyes, and ſee not, Ears, and hear not!</hi> Every natural man is one of theſe who have Eyes, and ſee not, Ears, and hear not. The myſteries of the Kingdom of God are fooliſhneſs to the natural Soul; what a notion of <hi>Regeneration</hi> had <hi>Nicodemus? Joh.</hi> 3. what notions of <hi>Juſtification, Union with Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>indwelling of the Spirit, Faith,</hi> &amp;c. have ſome others diſcovered? Natural men have <hi>rational Souls,</hi> as well as others, and by the workings of them underſtand many Propoſitions in Religion, which ſhine in the light of <hi>Natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;</hi> but there are <hi>Myſteries of the Kingdom of God,</hi> Doctrines that ſhine only in the light of Scripture; of theſe they underſtand little or nothing: Nay, for the more common notions of Religion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Immortality of the Soul,</hi> the <hi>Nature of God,</hi> the <hi>Doctrines of Faith, Repentance, Good works;</hi> when once the heart is changed, the Soul ſeeth them in quite another light, and hath quite another notion of them than it had before, while it was only under the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and the Miniſterial inſtruction of Men. <hi>Paul</hi> prayeth for the <hi>Epheſians, Epheſ.</hi> 1. 17, 18. <hi>That the God of Glory would give them the Spirit of Wiſdom and Revelation in the knowledge of him, the Eyes of their underſtanding being inlightened,</hi> &amp;c. It is the Spirit that inlighteneth the underſtanding, and inableth it to a fuller, and further comprehenſion of, and inſight into the Spiritual Myſteries of the Kingdom of God. When the Diſciples came to our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 10. and asked him, why he ſpake to the multitude in Parables, he tells them, <hi>v.</hi> 11. becauſe <hi>it was given to his Diſciples to know the Myſteries of the Kingdom of God,</hi> but to the multitude it was not given. From hence have proceeded the vain ſpeculations
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:61084:61"/>
and reaſonings of one part of the world, that have pretended to more Learning and Knowledge than others; and the prophane ſcoffs and mockings of a more ſilly part of it, at the greateſt Myſteries of the Kingdom of God. Some by Wiſdom know not God, being under the meer conduct of reaſon, and tying up themſelves to the meer informations of that natural Eye: Some knowing leſs, have blaſphemed God, and the holy things of God, counting their own <hi>Ignorance</hi> a ſufficient excuſe for their <hi>Blaſphemy.</hi> None knoweth the things of God aright, but he that is under the <hi>Teaching of the Spirit.</hi> Take the firſt Principle of all Religion, <hi>viz. That the holy Scriptures are the Word of God;</hi> no Soul knoweth this as he ought to know it, but he that is under a further Teaching than that of the <hi>Church,</hi> or of <hi>Reaſon;</hi> much leſs doth it know the momentous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions that are contained in thoſe holy Writings. To all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge there is required, 1. <hi>A ſufficient Revelation.</hi> 2. <hi>A ſufficiency in our faculty to receive and comprehend the Revelation.</hi> The holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures are a ſufficient Revelation of all Truth. There are no My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of the Kingdom of God to be admitted, but what are there revealed. But we want a <hi>viſive faculty,</hi> a ſufficiency in our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings to apprehend, and to conceive them, till the Lord by the finger of his Spirit toucheth our Ears, and ſaith, <hi>Ephatha,</hi> be opened. When <hi>Peter</hi> made his confeſſion of Chriſt, for which Chriſt bleſſed him, Chriſt addeth; <hi>Fleſh and blood hath not revealed it to him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2,</note> Secondly, The Spirit teacheth by a <hi>ſpecial Application of the Word to the Conſcience.</hi> The Word as written is no more directed to one man than to another; it equally concerneth all men. When we Preach we are like <hi>Benhadad</hi>'s <hi>Archers,</hi> we draw Bows at adventures, and let the Lord's Arrows fly, who is it that directs them betwixt the joints of one harneſs more than another? that when we reprove ſin, and denounce the Judgments of God againſt it, ſaith to this or that ſinner, <hi>Thou art the man;</hi> or when we diſplay the grace of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and open the Promiſes of God, teacheth one Soul to apply them, while another refuſeth the comfort of them: All ſpecial Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Word to the Soul, (which indeed is the true Teaching) is from the holy Spirit of God. It is the Spirit that was promiſed, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 8. to convince the world of <hi>Sin, Righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> It is the Spirit which convinceth the Soul of <hi>Truth,</hi> of <hi>Wrath,</hi> of <hi>Love,</hi> indeed of any thing of Spiritual Revelation. It is the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that makes the Word ſtick to the Soul: All the Miniſters on Earth cannot make a <hi>threatning</hi> to ſtick to the heart of an hard and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:61084:61"/>
impenitent ſinner, nor a Promiſe ſtick to a <hi>broken and contrite heart,</hi> until the Spirit comes and joyneth with the Miniſtration of the Word. We ſometimes meditate of the Lord's terrours, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Diſcourſes with the beſt Art we are able, and in the vanity of our hearts, are, it may be, ſometimes ſaying within our ſelves, Surely this Sermon will alarum ſome ſinners, open ſome blind Eyes. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time we ſtudy the Grace of the Goſpel, and with the beſt Art we can compoſe Diſcourſes to affect Souls with the ſenſe of the love of God in Jeſus Chriſt, and are ready to think, ſurely this Diſcourſe will affect ſome Souls, and bring them to love and admire Jeſus Chriſt, to ſeek to him for pardon and forgiveneſs, to receive him as the Saviour of man, as their Saviour. We go about our work, and when we have done, we ſee cauſe to return unto the Lord that ſent us, mourning, and ſaying, We <hi>have laboured in vain, and ſpent our ſtrength for nothing, and in vain.</hi> The Spirit of the Lord moves not upon the face of our waters; there's not one Soul waſhed from its filthineſs: The Angel comes not and troubles the waters; though our people lye from year to year at the Pool, yet poſſible not a Soul is cured of its infirmity. The Word is but a <hi>dead letter,</hi> it is the <hi>Spirit that quickeneth</hi> whom he pleaſeth. The Word, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter teacheth us by communicating notions, but the Spirit only teacheth by particular and effectual Application of notions to our Souls advantage.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">3.</note> Thirdly, <hi>The Spirit teacheth by evident Demonſtration.</hi> There is a threefold Demonſtration of things. 1. The <hi>Demonſtration of Senſe.</hi> Thus it is demonſtrable, that the Fire burneth, that Snow is white; all know that ſpiritual things come under no ſuch <hi>Demonſtration.</hi> 2. The <hi>Demonſtration of Reaſon;</hi> thus a proper effect is a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the cauſe: Some Propoſitions in Religion are indeed ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of this demonſtration. The <hi>Creation</hi> demonſtrateth a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, &amp;c. But alas! there are very few things in Religion that fall under the demonſtration of Reaſon; moſt Propoſitions of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture depend upon <hi>Revelation;</hi> and the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>truth of them is to be judged from thence. That <hi>Chriſt is the eternal Son of God; That he took upon him our Nature; died for Sinners:</hi> In ſhort, all the main Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of Religion, all Propoſitions immediately concerning our Salvation, all Articles of Faith, are things which fall not under the demonſtration of <hi>Reaſon.</hi> 3. There is therefore Thirdly, a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of the Spirit.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us his Preaching was in the <hi>Demonſtration of the Spirit,</hi> that is, attended with the <hi>Demonſtration</hi>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:61084:62"/>
                  <hi>of the Spirit;</hi> and (let Scoffers ſay what they will) if this <hi>Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit</hi> attendeth not all our Preaching, we do but beat the Air, and labour in vain. <hi>Logicians</hi> rightly tell us of two ſorts of Arguments: The one they call <hi>Topicks;</hi> the other <hi>Demonſtrations:</hi> The difference of them lies in the effects they have upon our minds: The former make a thing only probable to us, the other make it cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. If a notion appears only probable to us, we have ſome doubts and fears, and ſuſpicions about the truth of it. Nothing is demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated to us, but that of the truth of which we have no further doubts, againſt which we can make no Objections. Now nothing but the Spirit of God thus teacheth. The Gifts of Miniſters are various; the diſcourſes of ſome may be meer words, oratorial diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes; theſe of all others have leaſt influence upon any but airy Souls; others more mind their work, and knowing that nothing but the Word of God layeth hold on the Conſcience, endeavour to prove what they ſay by holy Writ; and ſome in this are more happy than others, as they are more skilled in the Scriptures, and the true ſenſe of them; others are more <hi>rational</hi> in their diſcourſes, men of great parts, good reaſon; though the ſecond ſort of theſe beſt diſcharge their Office, yet the effect of the beſt is to make a thing but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable to the Soul. The Soul will find out ſome diſtinctions, excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and evaſions, until it comes under this <hi>Teaching of the Spirit;</hi> it is an eaſie thing to make it probable to the Soul, that it is in a road and high-way to Hell and eternal deſtruction; that ſin is the vileſt thing in the world; that there is no way of Salvation but by Jeſus Chriſt: In ſhort, any Goſpel Propoſition may eaſily be made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, either by reaſon working from connate natural Principles, or (at leaſt to thoſe Souls that own the Scriptures to be the Word of God) from Propoſitions of holy Writ; but ſtill I ſay, till the holy Spirit of God comes to teach the Soul, the Soul will not be fully perſuaded, indeed not at all perſuaded, but have this, and the other thing to ſay againſt it. Nothing ſilenceth the Soul to the revelation of any Spiritual Truth, ſo as it diſputeth it no more (unleſs it be perhaps in a fit, or under ſome great temptation) but this Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">4.</note> Fourthly, The Spirit teacheth by <hi>Recapitulation, or bringing to remembrance.</hi> I have my ground for this from that of our Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 6. <hi>The Comforter, which is the Holy Ghoſt, whom the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will ſend in my name, he will teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatſoever I have ſaid unto you.</hi> This
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:61084:62"/>
                  <hi>Teaching</hi> by way of <hi>bringing to remembrance,</hi> is an excellent way of Teaching. It is one reaſon why Chriſtians profit no more by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, becauſe they never meditate; they ſeldom or never call to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance</hi> what they have heard. If a <hi>Schoolmaſter</hi> ſhould learn a Child his Grammar Rules once, and never make him bring them again to his remembrance, he would learn but little. An improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in notional knowledge of ſpiritual things, doth depend upon often calling to remembrance what we have heard. But the Spirits bringing to remembrance is yet a more excellent thing, and there is the ſame diſproportion betwixt our own bringing to remembrance, ſomething we have read of the Word of God, or heard out of it, and the holy Spirit's bringing to remembrance; that there is betwixt <hi>Miniſterial Inſtruction,</hi> and the <hi>Inſtruction</hi> of the Spirit of God at the firſt. As man's inſtruction and firſt teaching reacheth no further than that power of man's Soul, by which he receiveth the bare no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a thing, and that imperfectly too; but the holy Spirit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructeth the heart, and reins, and teacheth the ſecret and inward parts of the Soul: So man's <hi>bringing to remembrance</hi> things which we have heard from God, doth no more than revive the notion of them in our underſtandings, making the firſt prints of them more deep, plain, and legible: But the holy Spirit's bringing things to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, is a bringing them to the remembrance of the whole Soul, renewing thoſe motions of the will and affections which it taught the Soul with reference to thoſe Propoſitions, which by Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial Teaching, or by reading the Word, were firſt, by the help of our Eyes, and Ears, brought into our Souls, and carried by the holy Spirit of God further into the underſtanding, the will and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, by which the Soul is anew inſtructed, convinced, comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſtrengthened, &amp;c. to which our repetitions of, and diſcourſes of what we have read and heard, ſerve but as means to ſo noble an end; and without the attaining of that indeed, is of very little ſignifican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to our Souls real profit and advantage.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">5.</note> Laſtly, The Spirit's Teaching, is by <hi>ſtrengthening and quickening the Soul to practice.</hi> We call upon men <hi>not to be hearers of the Word, but doers of it alſo;</hi> but we cannot make them ſo, we cannot give them an inward Principle of Life, either <hi>ſtrengthening, or quickening them to do what we call to them for;</hi> and this is the reaſon why we oft-times labour in vain, and ſpend our ſtrength for nothing and in vain. Old <hi>Adam</hi> is too hard for young <hi>Melancthon.</hi> We ſee this in the experience of every School-Boy. The beſt Teaching is by
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:61084:63"/>
practice. Let a Child learn his Rules never ſo well, he underſtands them not till he comes to reduce them to practice; therefore the beſt Teachers put Children upon practice as ſoon as they can. <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>Pro</hi> 1. 7. <hi>The fear of the Lord is the beginning</hi> of Knowledge. The end of all Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is practice. We therefore deſire to know, that we might practice, &amp; he that hath not been taught to practice in the things of God, hath indeed learned nothing. By this time I hope I have ſhewed you, that admitting the teaching of the Letter, and of the Miniſters, there is none left for the teaching of the Spirit; and that there is a vaſt difference betwixt a meer external Communion with God in his Word, and an internal Communion with him in and by the Word; ſo as we have no reaſon either to deſpiſe <hi>Ordinances,</hi> or to reſt in that external homage which we pay unto God in the obſervance of them, and ſufficient reaſon why the Soul of an underſtanding Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſhould not be ſatisfied with the reading and hearing the words of Chriſt's mouth, without the kiſſes of his mouth. For the proof of the Propoſition, I ſhall give you firſt the inſtance of holy <hi>David;</hi> take it as it lieth before you, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 63. 1, 2. 3. <hi>O God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>thou art my God, early will I ſeek thee, in a dry and thirſty Land where no water is;</hi> he means no waters of the Sanctuary. The title of that <hi>Pſalm</hi> tells you, that <hi>Pſalm</hi> was compoſed when <hi>David was in the wilderneſs of Judah,</hi> in the time of his perſecution by <hi>Saul,</hi> when he had not the liberty of God's Publick Ordinances. In this condition he thirſteth, he longeth, for what? <hi>for thee,</hi> ſaith he. Further yet, <hi>v.</hi> 2. <hi>To ſee thy power and thy glory, ſo as I have ſeen thee in the Sanctuary; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thy loving-kindneſs is better than life.</hi> You ſee <hi>David</hi>'s de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires are not terminated in a coming into the Sanctuary, but a ſeeing the <hi>power and glory</hi> of God <hi>in the Sanctuary,</hi> in an underſtanding the loving-kindneſs of God revealed in his Sanctuary. And (in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the ſame paſſion) <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42. 1. <hi>As the Hart panteth after the water-brooks, ſo panteth my Soul after thee O God: My Soul thirſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for God, the living God; when ſhall I come and appear before God?</hi> It is manifeſt by the laſt words, that the thing which <hi>David</hi> thirſted after, was a communion with God in the Ordinances of his Worſhip; but yet not after a meer external communion with him. <hi>My Soul panteth after thee O God, for God, the living God.</hi> So in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. <hi>v.</hi> 18. <hi>Open my Eyes O Lord, that I might diſcern the wonders of the Law;</hi> not my Ears only to hear thy Law; or my Eyes, that I may read the Doctrine of the Law, but that I <hi>may diſcern the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of thy Law. Paul</hi> did not think it enough that the <hi>Epheſians</hi>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:61084:63"/>
and <hi>Coloſſians</hi> had the Word of God amongſt them, and Preach'd to them by Apoſtles, and men immediately deriving from them; but for the former he prayes, <hi>that the Eyes of their underſtanding might be opened;</hi> and for the latter, <hi>That the Word of God might dwell in them richly;</hi> but what need have we of any Scripture in the caſe? I appeal to the experience of every good Chriſtian, what Soul is there that knoweth any thing of God, or of the nature and end of Ordinances, that can be ſatisfied with meer reading of a Chapter, of hearing of a Sermon, without finding his heart at all affected with what he reads or hears, any operation of it at all upon his heart and conſcience. <hi>Formaliſts</hi> indeed, who think that God is pleaſed with noiſes and empty ſounds, and with meer bodily labour, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth nothing, may be ſatisfied with going to Church, and hearing a diſcourſe from a Pulpit, and that too of ſmall or no tendency to do good to a Soul; but it is impoſſible that a conſcientious Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, that looks upon Ordinances as opportunities, under a Divine appointment, wherein God hath promiſed to meet the Souls of people and bleſs them, wherein God hath appointed to come, and to ſpeak unto peoples Souls, ſhould be ſatisfied with the meer external action or homage, but he muſt thirſt after that bleſſing which God hath promiſed to his people, when he meets them in places, or duties, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he hath recorded his Name to dwell. But I ſhall ſhew you further, how highly reaſonable this is upon this <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> That there is ſuch an inward communion of God with his People in his Inſtitutions.</p>
               <p>One reaſon may be, becauſe <hi>a meer outward Communion with God is not diſtinguiſhing mercy;</hi> and this is known to every Soul who knoweth any thing of God. <hi>Pariter adeunt, pariter audiunt,</hi> (ſaid <hi>Auguſtine)</hi> Hypocrites as well Saints go to Church, hear <hi>Sermons,</hi> read <hi>Chapters.</hi> This is a favour God gives to all within the pale of his Church, which is a field hath Tares in it as well as Wheat; a <hi>Drag-net,</hi> whoſe ſwallow hath in it good Fiſh, as well as bad. Every Hypocrite may yield God the homage of his Eye and Ear, and ſome thoughts. I ſhewed you before, that it is of the nature of a Child of God to thirſt after diſtinguiſhing mercies: This is that which ſuch Souls long after, to have ſome tokens of good from God, which may ſpeak God's loving-kindneſs to them. They are awakened to a ſenſe of their loſt condition by nature, and to a fenſe of Eternity; and they know nothing but the Adoption of Sons; nothing but an Union with Chriſt can do their Souls any good with reference to their greateſt wants. Beſides, ſuch Souls as they thirſt after what
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:61084:64"/>
is beſt ſuited to their Souls greateſt wants; ſo they have learned to value the <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Favour</hi> of God above all earthly things: They know that all within the pale of the Church, are not in the favour of God; <hi>many are called, and few are choſen. Strait is the way, and narrow is the gate that leadeth to eternal life, and few there be that find it.</hi> Many ſhall ſeek to enter, and ſhall not enter.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2.</note> Secondly, <hi>A meer external Communion with God, is upon the point no Communion with him.</hi> It is indeed improperly called a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him. <hi>God</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>is a Spirit,</hi> and from thence a Chriſtian concludeth, that thoſe who <hi>worſhip him, muſt worſhip him in Spirit and Truth.</hi> I told you before, That in all Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, there muſt be a <hi>mutual communication.</hi> In our <hi>Communion with God,</hi> God communicateth ſomething of himſelf to the Soul, and the Soul muſt communicate it ſelf in ſome degrees unto God. Now in our meer external Communion with God, in the hearing of his Word, or reading of it, what doth God communicate to us? no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the <hi>revelation of his Will</hi> to our exteriour ſenſes, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe and underſtanding, and the laſt but in an imperfect degree. What doth man communicate of himſelf to God? he lends him his Eye, to gather up the Letters of a Book to preſent them to his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; he lends him his Ear, to hear ſounds, which may car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſome notions of God to the underſtanding; he lends him a little bodily preſence and labour, to do for a little time what he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to do; but all this while the man communicateth not his <hi>heart and ſoul,</hi> his <hi>will and affections to God;</hi> nor doth God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate any thing of his power and goodneſs unto the Soul. So that if we conſider God as a Spirit, and who requireth of us the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the Soul and inward man, it is upon the point no fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and communion with God at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">3.</note> Thirdly, A meer external fellowſhip and communion with God in his Word (if it may be ſo called) wants thoſe two <hi>adjuncts, which moſt allure and inflame the Soul with deſires;</hi> they are <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,</hi> and <hi>profit:</hi> There is no true pleaſure in it, no true profit and advantage to a Soul ariſing from it. I noted to you before, that one reaſon of the Soul's thirſt after communion with God in his Word, is the pleaſure and ſweetneſs which every pious Soul findeth in it. <hi>David</hi> ſaith, the Word was <hi>ſweeter to his taſt than the Honey and the Honey-comb;</hi> and he ſaith, <hi>That one day in the Lord's Courts is better than a thouſand elſewhere.</hi> But let us a little wiſtly conſider wherein the ſweetneſs of the Word lieth; what maketh the Bible to
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:61084:64"/>
be ſweeter than another Book? or a Sermon to be a more pleaſant diſcourſe than any other? The ſweetneſs cannot lie in the gratify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our exteriour ſenfes, or of our fancy; much reading is a wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs to the fleſh; ſo is much hearing, much ſtudy: The ſweetneſs of the Word of God, and diſcourſes out of it, lies in the fittedneſs of the revelations there, and of ſuch diſcourſes, to the diſtreſſes, and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual neceſſities of the Soul, and the inſight the Word gives us into the great things of God, the great Myſteries of the Kingdom of God: Now no pleaſure, no delight, no ſweetneſs of this nature ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to, or in any Soul, from a meer external communion with God in it. Hence it is that carnal unregenerate men had rather ſpend four or five hours at a Play, or a Muſick-meeting, or Ball, than one at a Sermon; they find no ſweetneſs, no pleaſure at all in the Word. The Preacher indeed may be as one that hath the voice of a pleaſant lovely Song, and have ſome witty ſentences; this may pleaſe them; or if they be perſons that are prophane, and hate all Religion and Godlineſs, he may uſe his wit in ſome jeers and ſquibs at Religion, and this may tickle their luſts a little; but a diſcourſe out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture tending to the true ends of Preaching, informing the Judgment in the Doctrines of Faith, or perſuading the practice of Godlineſs, are the moſt unpleaſant ſounds in the world to ſuch mens Ears. There is no Soul breathing, that takes, or can take any pleaſure from, or find any ſweetneſs in <hi>reading,</hi> or <hi>hearing,</hi> that experienceth no <hi>inward communion with God</hi> in the action, or at leaſt that deſires none. 2. A ſecond great <hi>Attractive</hi> and mover of our deſires, is <hi>profit and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage;</hi> and in this caſe it muſt be the profit and advantage of our Souls; for they are actions from which no worldly profit and gain doth ariſe ordinarily. Now all the profit that can be ſo much as imagined to ariſe from the world, as meerly read in our Bibles, or heard opened from the Miniſters of the Goſpel, or <hi>meditated upon,</hi> can be nothing but ſome <hi>ſuperficial notional knowledge in the things of God.</hi> Knowledge indeed is an excellent thing, and as pleaſant to an ingenuous Soul as Light is to the Eye, and ſuch a Soul counts it amongſt his gains, and this may, and doth draw out not only true, and good, and pious Souls, to read, and hear Sermons, and ſtudy the Scriptures, but it may, and doth entice and allure others. But the pious Soul feeth a profit beyond this he hath read, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>That the holy Scriptures are able to make a man wiſe to ſalvation, through Faith which is in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> V. 17. <hi>To make the man of God perfect, throughly furniſhed to every good work.</hi> He hath heard
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:61084:65"/>
that good words from thence have made Souls better, when ſorrow hath made the heart to ſtoop; this is the profit, this the advantage which he promiſeth unto himſelf from the Word of God; this makes him thirſt after a real, inward, ſpiritual communion with God in his Word; he knows nothing leſs than this can anſwer the ends which his Soul aimeth at. That it is not being in the Sanctuary, but his <hi>ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the power and glory of God in the Sanctuary,</hi> which muſt effect this. Hence it is, that though a more External communion with God in his word be ſweet and deſirable to him, yet he cannot take up with it, but he thirſteth after the Teachings of his Spirit, in and by the Word. But I ſee I muſt leave much of this diſcourſe to other opportunities.</p>

It is one thing for a man or woman to give God his bodily preſence, his Eyes, and his Ears in an Ordinance; another thing for the Soul to give up his will in it to comply with the will of God in what he ſhall reveal unto it. I am afraid this is a notion is little either underſtood, or attended to. Men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men think they have done their work, and fulfilled their duty, if they have but read a little in their Bibles, and come to Church to hear a Sermon, never regarding what inward communion they have had with God either in the one or the other; and look at no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Communication</hi> of God unto them, than to let them know his will; nor at any further communicating themſelves unto God, than in lending him the preſence of their outward man, and the more out-parts and powers of their Souls. This apprehenſion of men makes them ſtand amazed at God's Peoples being ſo fond of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and running after them. Indeed, were this all that good men and women expected, they might poſſibly not be ſo exceedingly thirſty after them, though even a notional knowledge of the will of God, is no contemptible thing; but they have further expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon Ordinances than this amounteth to. They ſaid, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>Come you, let us go to the mountain of the Lord, to the houſe of the God of</hi> Jacob, <hi>and he will teach us his waies, and we will walk in his paths.</hi> They know that God promiſed of old, That <hi>whereſoever he</hi>

Br.</note> From this diſcourſe alſo may be concluded, <hi>in what communion with God through the Spirit lieth.</hi> Some would have it to lie in meer <hi>Enthuſiaſtical raptures,</hi> impreſſions and revelations, and that the way to enjoy it, is to caſt off all Forms, all Duties and Ordinances; theſe are the things they make to be the <hi>things that are above,</hi> mentioned in <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 1. Certainly there is a form of ſound Doctrine, which the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> commendeth the <hi>Romans</hi> for yielding obedience to, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 17. <hi>A form of ſound words,</hi> which he commandeth <hi>Timothy to hold faſt,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13. Theſe are not that <hi>form of Godlineſs</hi> in men that deny the power of it, which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of in that Epiſtle. There are Duties and Ordinances, to be above which, is to be above the Rule which God hath given us. Our Souls commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God through the Spirit, is not out of Ordinances, but in and by them. The Teaching of the Letter is not oppoſed, but ſubordinated to the Teaching of the Spirit. There is room enough for the Teaching of the holy Spirit, after the Miniſter hath done what he can to teach us; nor is it to be blaſphemed by ill tongued men, becauſe themſelves do not underſtand what it means; they only ſpeak evil of the things they know not. The Power of God upon the heart faſtening the words we read and hear, upon our hearts and conſciences, as a Nail in a ſure place, is a thing only known unto the Souls that have had experience of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">3. Br.</note> But the great thing I deſire you might be inſtructed in from this diſcourſe, is, <hi>The difference betwixt a prophane perſon, and hypocrites, and the true Children of God, which may be diſcerned from their affections to the Word of God.</hi> The prophane perſon wholly deſpiſeth and ſlighteth the Word of God, both the written Word, and the Word Preached; it ſerveth him for nothing but a ſubject to exerciſe his prophane wit upon. The Hypocrite dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving another deſign glorying in ſhew and appearance; he muſt have ſome pretended reſpect at leaſt to the Word of God; but he reſts meerly in reading or in hearing, and regardeth not either how far
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:61084:66"/>
God in the Word communicates himſelf to him, nor yet how far he communicates his Soul unto God in the Ordinance. Let an Hypocrite go with a multitude, and hear a Sermon, he hath enough if he can but ſay, I have been at the Ordinance, whether his Soul hath been at all inſtructed or affected; whether any Word of God hath come nigh to his heart, laid any hold upon his conſcience yea or no; he hath no true thirſt after any communion with God in the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; if he hath been but ſeen in the Lord's Courts, or at moſt be furniſhed with matter of diſcourſe to talk of amongſt Chriſtians, ſo as they may take him to be a Diſciple, his ends are ſatisfied. But it is otherwiſe with a Child of God; he is troubled when he cometh from an Ordinance, if he doth not find he hath had ſome commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God in the Ordinance. That God hath either more ſealed, and further confirmed ſome Truth to his Soul, or convinced him of ſome ſin, or comforted him with ſome Promiſe; ſome way or other ſpoken unto his heart. Methinks the difference betwixt an Hypocrite and a Child of God in this caſe may be reſembled, by the going of a Child with another companion (who is no Child) to a Father's houſe, where they find themſelves ſplendidly entertained; but the Child ſeeth not his <hi>Father's face;</hi> the Child's companion is pleaſed, and comes home talking, and boaſting of his entertainment; but the Child's heart is ſad; the end of the Child's Journey was to ſee his Father's face, and to have his Father's bleſſing; without this the good chear doth him no good. The <hi>formal Hypocrite</hi> comes home from Ordinances, pleaſing himſelf that he hath been at Church, that he hath heard a quaint learned diſcourſe, and his tongue may run great deſcants upon ſuch things as theſe. The Child of God is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with none of theſe things; he went to his Father's houſe, that he might ſee his Father's face; if he can find no evidence of that, his Soul is diſcontented and unſatisfied; he cries, I have laboured in vain, I have loſt another day of grace, and opportunity of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; I have <hi>been ſeeking the Lord in vain,</hi> and waiting upon him for nothing. And this is the very reaſon why a pious Soul cannot hear every body, nor take up with all Sermons or diſcourſes; he doth not go to Church to hear the voice of a man, but the Word of God, and goeth with an expectation to meet with a bleſſing from God; and therefore he will hear where the Word of God is ſo opened, ſo applied, as he can expect God's bleſſing upon it. He cannot expect that God's bleſſing ſhould go along with any to whom he hath ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 16, 17. <hi>What haſt thou to do to declare my Statutes, or that</hi>

                  <hi>thou ſhouldſt take my Covenant in thy mouth, ſeeing thou hateſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and caſteſt my words behind thee?</hi> He will not therefore ſit under the Miniſtry of one that is openly prophane and wicked, and of a ſcandalous life: Nor one that teacheth <hi>other Doctrine,</hi> than what is according to ſound Doctrine and godlineſs, and the form of <hi>ſound words</hi> delivered in the Word of God; or him that <hi>giveth heed to Fables, and endleſs Genealogies, which miniſter Queſtions rather than godly Edifying which is in Faith,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 4.

               <p>In the next place, this will give us another advantage to <hi>try our ſtate with reference to God's favour; An earneſt deſire after an inward ſpiritual communion with God in any Ordinance or Duty, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfaction of a Soul without it, will very much argue a man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to be a Chriſtian indeed;</hi> whereas a bare going to an Ordinance, a bare fancy or deſire to hear, or a meer <hi>hearing,</hi> will ſpeak a man no more than a nominal titular Chriſtian, and be an evidence, that the Soul reſteth in a meer bodily labour and exerciſe, which profiteth nothing. This is a great point; the being in the Sanctuary, will ſatisfie an Hypocrite; nothing but the ſeeing <hi>the power and glory of God in the Sanctuary,</hi> will ſatisfie <hi>David</hi> the man according to God's own heart. But it is hard for us to keep a <hi>medium</hi> in any thing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt. As in the heart of a Formaliſt, there is nothing of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, nothing of this diſſatisfaction; ſo many times in the heart of a good Chriſtian, there may be too much of this <hi>diſſatisfaction,</hi> and a diſcontent and diſſatisfaction founded in ſome miſtake; let me there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a little enlarge upon this ſo uſeful a Subject.</p>

All this may be without any deſire after the <hi>kiſſes of Chriſt's mouth,</hi> but a deſire after the feeling the power of the Word upon our hearts, and a diſſatisfaction of ſpirit, until a man findeth ſomething of this upon his Soul, this will ſpeak a man or woman not to reſt in a form of godlineſs without the power of it; yet even this diſſatisfaction may be too much, and this happeneth, when it proceedeth from ſome miſtake and miſapprehenſion of Religious Souls.

               <p>Firſt, For Arguments, what I gave you for <hi>Reaſons</hi> may ſerve. <hi>Thus you ſhall ſhew your ſelves to be Chriſtians indeed.</hi> The Wiſe muſt ſee the face of an Husband, though a little Child may be pleaſed with the Picture. Take an Ordinance, of it ſelf it hath ſomething of the impreſſion of God upon it: God is there as a man in a Picture; but this can never ſatisfie a truly thirſty Soul after God; he thirſts after God himſelf; <hi>My Soul</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) thirſteth for thee. David</hi> muſt ſee <hi>the power and glory of God in the Sanctuary.</hi> An Hypocrite may have a fancy to go to Ordinances, to <hi>hear Sermons,</hi> &amp;c. that's common to perſons that ſhall periſh with ſuch as ſhall be ſaved: There may be many ends which Hypocrites may have, which that may ſerve well enough: But herein as to this point ſtands a good Chriſtian diſtinguiſhed from all Hypocrites and Formaliſts in the world as to this particular.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Till your hearts be brought to this, Duties will be nothing elſe but a continual task and a burden to your ſouls.</hi> There will be no great pleaſure ariſing to any Soul from a bare <hi>reading</hi> or <hi>hearing</hi> the Word of the Lord. The Formaliſts among the Jews, that lookt at nothing but the bodily labour, quickly came to prophane the Table of the Lord, and to account the meat there <hi>contemptible,</hi> and to ſay, <hi>Behold what a wearineſs is it! Mal.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>Amos</hi> tell us, <hi>chap.</hi> 8. 5. that they ſaid, <hi>When will the New Moon be gone, that we may ſell Corn, and the Sabbath that we may ſet forth VVheat.</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will deliver the Soul from the burden of religious duties, I mean, the looking upon them as ſuch, but ſome <hi>Sweetneſs</hi> diſcerned in them, or ſome <hi>Profit,</hi> which it diſcerneth ariſing from them, neither of which will be diſcerned by any Soul, which taſteth nothing of God in them, nor hath any Communion with him by, and through them; but theſe things I before touched upon, as alſo the danger of a meer bodily labour in this religious Duty; I ſhall therefore rather ſpend the Remainder of my time in directing you what to do, that

                  <hi>Go out to hear the word of God as the word of God.</hi> The Apoſtle bleſſeth God on the behalf of his <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> 1 Theſ. 2. 13. <hi>That when they received the word of God,—they received it not as the word of men,</hi> but (as it was in truth) <hi>the word of God, which effectually worketh in them that believe.</hi> I am afraid this is one thing which is much wanting in many Preachers, &amp; more hearers; the former do not go out to preach the word, <hi>as the word of God:</hi> The other do not go out to hear it under that notion, <hi>as the word of God.</hi> It is a Phraſe hath a great deal in it, and is comprehenſive of all that previous preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which is our duty with reference to an Inſtitution of God, and that to ſo great an End as the Salvation of the Soul is.

A man that ſhall ſpeak to me ſmooth things, and deliver himſelf in words that are proper to expreſs what he ſaith: But whom am I going to hear? One that hath a pleaſant Voice, like one that ſingeth to, or playeth well upon an Inſtrument, ſuch a one I may hear in the Schools of Rhetorick and Oratory: But whom do I go out for to hear? One
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:61084:70"/>
that can diſcourſe rationally upon an Argument; I may hear ſuch a one in the Schools of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Plato:</hi> Whom then do I go to Church for to hear? A <hi>Prophet:</hi> One that diſcourſeth of the things of God; yea, and <hi>more than a Prophet:</hi> I am going to hear God and Chriſt himſelf ſpeaking to me him, of whom God hath ſaid, <hi>This is my well beloved Son, hear ye him.</hi> For though it be a man that ſpeaketh, yet it is a man ſent of God, cloathed with the Authority of Jeſus Chriſt, and ſpeaking to me his Words, and in his Name; nor am I to regard any thing I hear, but what agreeth with what he hath ſpoken, or his holy Prophets and Apoſtles, who were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately inſpired by him. The ſetting right of a Perſons firſt end, deſign, and intention, gives a mighty conduct to his Actions. And (as I before ſaid) it is very unreaſonable to expect Gods preſence, and Bleſſing with, and upon us, where the Heart is not ſet right with reference to its Intention and Deſign. It is true as to the firſt Grace, God is found of thoſe that ſeek him not, and of thoſe who do not enquire after him. No Soul would ever be converted, and brought home to God, if God did not meet it in his Word, before it had thus rightly fixed its deſign and intention in coming to hear the word of God, but what God may do and ſometimes doth out of his abounding and preventing Grace, is one thing, what a Soul may expect from God upon the account of any promiſe is another thing, the Archer may poſſibly hit the mark, though he hath never by his Eye levelled his Arrow at it, but he cannot promiſe himſelf that good hap. No Soul that ſetteth not his heart aright to ſeek God in any Ordinance, particularly this of hearing his word, who doth not before he go, ſet his Face towards <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſet this as a mark in his Eye, as the thing which he propoſeth to himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2.</note> Secondly, It doth not only comprehend the end of <hi>Intention</hi> and <hi>Deſign,</hi> but alſo the <hi>manner,</hi> and certainly none can pretend to hear the word <hi>as the word of God,</hi> but he muſt go to it without any levity, and with all manner of <hi>Seriouſneſs, and compoſure of Spirit.</hi> No Reverence, and Submiſſion of Spirit can be imagined too much for the great Majeſty of Heaven. We ought not to go to hear the word as if we were going to hear an <hi>Oration,</hi> much leſs as if we were going to a Play.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">3.</note> Thirdly, We cannot be thought to hear it <hi>as the word of God,</hi> without ſome previous lookings up to God for a Bleſſing upon it. We go for the <hi>Teachings of the Spirit.</hi> Our Saviour tells us, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. 14. <hi>He gives his holy Spirit to them that ask him.</hi> Chriſt firſt begg'd

                  <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                  <hi>Attend particularly to thoſe Impulſes which at ſome times thou mayeſt have to hear.</hi> A Chriſtian ſhall ſometimes find ſome particular <hi>impulſes</hi> upon him to hear. I would not be hear. I would not be here miſtaken, I know there is a dangerous Opinion imbibed, and promoved by ſome <hi>Enthuſiaſts,</hi> that Chriſtians ſhould never go to perform a Duty, whether praying or hearing, but upon ſome <hi>particular Impulſe</hi> or <hi>Motion.</hi> I call this a dangerous Principle, becauſe it is the firſt ſtep to caſting off all Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Ordinances. But yet let no Chriſtian neglect ſuch ſpecial <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſes.</hi> Impulſes to Actions that are contrary to our Duty in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Will of God, ought to be rejected, contemned, and abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; they muſt come from the boilings of corruption in our own hearts, or from the evil Spirit. Impulſes to Actions which are not expreſly commanded, nor yet forbidden, muſt be conſidered, and we ought to obey or not obey them, as Circumſtances, <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc,</hi> at this or that time, may determine it lawful or not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, expedient or not expedient, with Reference to the General rules which God in his word hath given us to guide all our Actions by. <hi>Impulſes</hi> to the Performance of our Duty under due Circumſtances ought never to be neglected. It may be well preſumed, that God hath ſomething to ſay to the Soul in particular at ſuch a time, when he gives it a ſpecial <hi>item</hi> and <hi>monition</hi> to go to hear.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, be ſure thou goeſt to hear <hi>with an humble Heart,</hi> and with as much of a <hi>poor, broken,</hi> and <hi>contrite Spirit as thou canſt.</hi> There is a Promiſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25. 9. <hi>The humble he will teach,</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. <hi>v.</hi> 15. <hi>Thus ſaith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth Eternity, and whoſe name is Holy, I dwell in the high and holy place, with him alſo that is of a contrite and humble Spirit, to revive the ſpirit of the humble, and to revive the hearts of the contrite ones.</hi> And <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66. <hi>v.</hi> 2. <hi>To the man will I look even to him that is of a poor, and contrite Spirit, and that trembleth at my word.</hi> God ſendeth the <hi>proud Soul empty away;</hi> take heed of going to hear with a proud Heart, ſelf-opinionated as to Knowledge, or ſelf-conceited. God teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the humble, dwelleth with the humble, looketh upon the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:61084:71"/>
The Rain that daſheth off, and runneth down the Mountains, reſteth in the Valleys; the Inſtructions, Reproofs, Convictions of the word which fall upon Men of proud and high Conceits and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of themſelves, reſt, and are drunk in by low, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Souls. The <hi>broken</hi> and <hi>contrite Heart</hi> is like the plowed ground, which is in itſelf more apt to receive, and drink in the word, than that ground where the ſurface is not at all broken, but there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides particular Promiſes made to <hi>Broken Hearts.</hi> The word you know is compared to <hi>Seed</hi> in the Parable of the Sower, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. and in ſeveral other Texts, the Husbandman uſeth not to ſow his Seed in the whole, but in the broken ground.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Be ſure you go to hear with unprejudiſed Hearts, willing and deſirous to learn.</hi> Prejudice naturally barreth the Ear to Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <hi>Ahab</hi>'s prejudice againſt <hi>Micajah</hi> ſtopt his Ears againſt the word of the Lord to him, and proved his fatal Ruine and Deſtruction. I ſhould never adviſe Chriſtians to ſit under the Miniſtry of any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they are prejudiſed againſt, it much contributeth to a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice againſt the word of the Lord ſpoken by them; if therefore in that caſe I could not remove my Prejudice, I would chuſe another Preacher; but I further added, that <hi>you ſhould go with Hearts willing and deſirous to know the Will of God:</hi> It is the chapt, thirſty ground that moſt drinks in the Rain, and is made moſt fruitful by it; it is the Soul that hungers, and thirſteth after the word that profiteth by it, and hath a communion with God in it; though the Word be Gods, and he breatheth upon the Soul according to his own good pleaſure, yet he breatheth upon, he teacheth no Souls but thoſe Souls that are willing, and deſirous to learn and to be inſtructed. It is true, it is he who firſt maketh them willing, who firſt enclineth their Ears to hear; but he firſt <hi>prepareth the Heart,</hi> and then <hi>cauſeth his Ear to hear,</hi> as to Prayer; ſo in hearing, he firſt <hi>circumciſeth the Ear</hi> of a man, and enclineth him to hear his Statutes, and then he teacheth them: He dealeth not with us as with Stocks, and Stones, but as with rational Creatures in a rational way.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">5.</note> 
                  <hi>Attend unto the word which thou goeſt to hear.</hi> No teaching, no good is to be expected from any teaching, where the perſon only lends an Ear, but ſuffers his Mind extravagantly to wander here and there. The Schoolmaſter hath no Patience for ſuch a Scholar, I am ſure God hath no Bleſſing for ſuch a Soul as in hearing doth not hear, nor encline his Ear to Underſtanding. The Scholar gets little by his Maſter or Tutors reading upon an Author, if the Scholar at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:61084:71"/>
not to the Text of the Author. The Spirits teaching is but a Commentary upon the word, it bringeth to remembrance the things which we have heard from God. The Soul that attends not to the word which he reads, or heareth, can expect nothing of the Spirits teaching; the word is not like to dwell in that Soul, that will not ſuffer it to come ſo much as over the Threſhold into it, I mean into its <hi>memory</hi> or <hi>notion.</hi>

But men may in hearing <hi>vex the Spirit</hi> in its Teaching, either by Non-Attendency, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering their hearts to be wandring elſewhere, when God in his word is teaching the Soul; this vexeth any Father, or Maſter in teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Child; but of this I ſpake before.

               <p>I Have done now with the matter of the Spouſes (that is the Churches, or the particular believing Souls) prayer in this her firſt Petition; I have nothing (as to the petition it ſelf) to conſider but the <hi>form</hi> of it.

               <p>I have ſhewed you, that ſhe asketh <hi>modeſtly</hi> but a kiſs, thereby letting us know how precious the leaſt of Chriſts Special, diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing love is to the truly believing Soul. Not that the leaſt diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, and meaſures of grace, will ſatisfy the Spiritual <hi>hunger</hi> and thirſt of a <hi>pious Soul;</hi> it is one thing for a pious Soul to prize, and value the leaſt, another thing to be ſatisfied, and fully contented with it, ſhe therefore mentions <hi>Kiſſes</hi> in the <hi>Plural Number,</hi> as well to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the variety of gracious Influences, as their frequent Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations. I have further taken notice of her particular deſire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a communion with God in his word, eſpecially Goſpel Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, and that not only a more external Communion with, God in reading, hearing and thinking upon it: But the more <hi>reall internal Spiritual</hi> communion with God in his word which the Soul hath by the <hi>teachings of the Spirit,</hi> She deſires not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to hear the words of his mouth, but to be kiſſed <hi>with the kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of his mouth.</hi> I have now nothing to do but to conſider the form of her words, and ſee if from thence we can gain any further Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Inſtruction.</p>

The words are firſt <hi>Vox volentis,</hi> the Language of a Soul, that was willing to receive theſe impreſſions; if ſhe were not willing, ſhe would not have made them the matter of her requeſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They are <hi>Vox cupientis,</hi> not onely the Language of one that was <hi>willing</hi> but of one inflamed with a deſire after the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject <hi>willed</hi> and <hi>propoſed.</hi> They do not expreſs a bare <hi>velleity</hi> with an <hi>indifferency</hi> as to the thing.

               <p>Laſtly, They are <hi>Vox petentis,</hi> the language of one upon her knees, begging it of God, as the great thing which ſhe ſought after.

The Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band communicates his heart, his love and affection, more to his Wife, than to any other perſon: So doth the Wife reciprocally to her Husband; ſo that of all other, the Conjugal Communion is the neareſt; ſuch is that mentioned in the Text. God communicates himſelf to all his creatures in ſome degree or other; he <hi>feedeth the young Ravens when they cry; he maketh his Sun to ſhine upon the juſt</hi>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:61084:73"/>
                  <hi>and upon the unjuſt:</hi> And they in ſome degree <hi>communicate</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to him as their <hi>Creator:</hi> The <hi>young Ravens cry;</hi> the <hi>wicked man houls upon his Bed;</hi> the vileſt man in diſtreſs cryes, <hi>Lord help me.</hi> This is like the Communion now that we may have with Strangers, yea Enemies. God doth further communicate himſelf to thoſe within the pale of his Church. To the Church belongs the <hi>Oracles of God;</hi> God further reveals his mind and will to ſuch as are within the boſom of it: They alſo do communicate themſelves unto God more than the others, that is, they pay him a further homage; they give him a more ſteady, conſtant, bodily ſervice; they <hi>read, hear, pray,</hi> &amp;c. This is like our communion with neighbours and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary friends. But now God doth further communicate himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſome perſons: He communicates his <hi>grace and power</hi> to their wills and affections; they are thereby made partakers of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, transformed into the Image of God, and they reciprocally ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received this Divine grace, give up their hearts unto God; this is that which I mean by near, conjugal communion, being like the communion which the Husband and Wife have each with other, of all other the fulleſt and neareſt. I ſay,</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1.</note> Firſt, <hi>The believing Soul is willing that God ſhould have ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with it.</hi> It is <hi>paſſively willing,</hi> not unwilling: Indeed every regenerate Soul is further willing than this comes to; but that I ſhall ſhew you by and by under another Head. This alone will diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh ſuch a Soul, from the Soul of an Hypocrite. Take an unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate man, he is not willing to this; he may be willing that God ſhould impart himſelf to him in outward bleſſings, which may gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie his ſenſe, and ſerve him as to his renewing neceſſities in the world; or that God ſhould impart to him ſome <hi>ſpiritual gifts;</hi> theſe may ſerve him as to his profit, or as to his honour, credit and reputation in the world; &amp; he may be willing to communicate and impart ſomething of himſelf to God (as I have before ſhewed you) but that God ſhould <hi>unite their hearts to fear his Name,</hi> (which was the prayer of <hi>David)</hi> that God ſhould cleanſe them from their corruptions, incline their hearts to his Teſtimonies; this they are not willing to. They are like ſome woman, that will ſay of ſuch a perſon as makes love to her, ſhe likes the man well enough to ſit and talk with her; but for an Husband ſhe cannot abide him. Thus the beſt unregenerate man dealeth with God. Some there are, prophane perſons, that cannot endure the Name of God or Chriſt; hate his Word, and all acts of communion with God, or any thing that relateth to him; but now
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:61084:73"/>
the formal Hypocrite, he can be content to go and ſit and hear a Sermon, and read a Chapter, wherein he hears God ſpeaking to him; yea and to pray ſometimes, by which duty he talks with God; but he abhorreth that God ſhould come near to his Soul, to captivate his underſtanding, to ſubdue his will, to direct his affections to truly ſpiritual Objects, he withdraweth his heart and affections from God. I think <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſomewhere confeſſeth, that in his unregenerate ſtate, he often prayed to God that he would give him ſtrength a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a particular corruption, when in the mean time he in his heart wiſhed that God would not hear his prayer. The unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate man is not willing that God ſhould have any near communion with him: He is not willing that the Law of God ſhould be wrote upon his heart, nor that the Lord ſhould rule over his inward man.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Regenerate Soul is not only <hi>willing,</hi> but <hi>deſirous:</hi> The willingneſs that is in him, is not a bare, <hi>lazy velleity,</hi> and a paſſive willingneſs, but an <hi>active willingneſs;</hi> he being made wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, his will commands his affections to move towards that which his will hath choſen; and indeed there is no true <hi>willing</hi> of any thing without this; for good being the proper Object of the ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal appetite, no ſooner hath the underſtanding diſcerned it, but the will chuſeth it, and naturally moveth by deſires towards it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I obſerved to you, that the words are in the <hi>form of a Prayer.</hi> What the <hi>Will</hi> hath choſen as good and ſuitable to a man's neceſſities, and upon that account hath by deſires moved towards, it commandeth the aſſiſtance of the outward man in the uſe of any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per mean to obtain. Prayer being an Ordinance and appointment of God, as a means in order to the obtaining any good thing which he hath promiſed; it is but a reaſonable motion of a reaſonable Soul. I put in the term <hi>rightly ordered,</hi> becauſe, as I ſhall ſhew you fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther anon, there is a ſufficient ground for it, in this form of words by which the Spouſe's Petition is expreſſed; and it is not every Prayer that is acceptable to God, but ſuch alone as he hath directed, God hath not only directed our duty as to the matter, but alſo as to the manner of the performance. But this is enough to have ſpoken, to give you the ſenſe of the Propoſition. I ſhall ſhew you now the ground or reaſon of it, whence in this thing there is ſuch a different temper and complexion betwixt the regenerate and the unregenerate Soul. The foundation of this lies <hi>in the change of the heart, which is wrought in the Child of God,</hi> which ſuppoſed theſe motions of his
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:61084:74"/>
Soul, will appear to be no more than the regular motions of reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Souls ſo complexionated. The Scripture every where deſcribeth the Child of God as a <hi>New Creature,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 17. <hi>If any man be in Chriſt he is a new creature, old things are paſſed away, and all things are become new.</hi> Epheſ. 4. 23. <hi>Be renewed in the ſpirit of your mind; And that you put on the new man, which after God is created in righteouſneſs and true holineſs.</hi> Col. 3. 10. And have <hi>put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge, after the Image of him that created him.</hi> The Child of God is <hi>transformed by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of his mind.</hi> Rom. 12. 2. <hi>Regenerated and born again.</hi> Joh. 3. 3. <hi>Except a man be born again, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God;</hi> born again of <hi>Water, and of the Spirit,</hi> as our Saviour ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth it, <hi>v.</hi> 5. Now this <hi>change,</hi> this <hi>renevation</hi> reſpecteth not the <hi>ſubſtantial</hi> power and faculties of the Soul. The ſame powers and faculties, the ſame <hi>underſtanding, will</hi> and <hi>affections;</hi> I mean the ſame powers which we call ſo remain, but they are changed as to their <hi>quality</hi> and aſpect unto Objects. The ſame wheels of the Soul remain, but they are ſet right, and move more regularly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards what are indeed their true and proper Objects. The natural man's underſtanding is <hi>blind,</hi> and <hi>dark,</hi> and <hi>weak,</hi> and <hi>impotent;</hi> he calleth <hi>good, evil,</hi> and <hi>evil, good, bitter things ſweet,</hi> and <hi>ſweet things bitter;</hi> his pallate is vitiated, ſo as he neither doth, nor can diſcern things truly and ſpiritually good. Until his nature be cultivated by <hi>moral Diſcipline,</hi> and ſome <hi>ingenious Education,</hi> he is like the Beaſt that periſheth, and judgeth of <hi>good</hi> and <hi>evil</hi> meerly by <hi>ſenſe.</hi> When it is <hi>cultivated</hi> he judgeth of it by <hi>reaſon,</hi> and determines good and evil according to rational Principles, and in that riſeth no higher, than to the perfection of an Heathen Philoſopher, who knew nothing of any ſuch thing as <hi>Union and Communion with God,</hi> and either believed nothing of the <hi>Immortality of the Soul,</hi> and ſo took not himſelf concerned to care for that, or at leaſt had a faint belief, and an imperfect notion of it. But the <hi>renewed man</hi> hath his <hi>underſtanding opened,</hi> to diſcern <hi>more excellent things.</hi> He eaſily ſeeth, That <hi>God is the chiefeſt Good,</hi> and thence concludes as ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, that the happineſs of man muſt needs conſiſt in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, in Union and Communion with him; as the Heathens determined, that the happineſs of a man muſt neceſſarily lye in the <hi>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uition</hi> of, and an union with the <hi>ſummum bonum,</hi> the greateſt good: This being determined by the <hi>underſtanding,</hi> by that new light and power of diſcerning, given it by God: The will, of whoſe nature
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:61084:74"/>
it is to follow the Dictates of the Underſtanding, ordinarily chuſeth and embraceth it, by as natural and rational a working as that wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Soul that knoweth no be tter things than good Meat, and Drink, and Cloaths, and Eſtates, chooſeth them, and embraceth them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore other things: Or the more <hi>cultivated</hi> Soul chooſeth Learning, and Knowledge, and moral Habits. Only in rega rd there is a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Debauchery and Corruption of the Will of man, there is a particular work of God upon the Will, changing and altering that, or elſe in Spiritual things it would not follow the Dictate of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and this may be ſeen in things benea th this Order. We indeed uſually ſay, the <hi>Will is a blind faculty, and follows the dictate of the Underſtanding;</hi> but ſince the Fall, man is ſo much mancipated and enſlaved to his ſenſual Appetite, that we ſee in daily experience it doth not. The drunkard, the unclean perſons are daily proofs of it, who know well enough that the proſecution of their Luſts in thoſe things doth not only deſtroy their contrary moral Habits, but ruine their Lives, Health, Reputation, yet cannot forbear the purſuit of them. But the Will being thus renewed to chuſe the beſt, ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual good, the affections move in a natural Order after it, and the outward man is commanded to all actions purſuant to it. So that I ſay, this Renovation of the whole Man according to the Image of God is the true cauſe of the Souls willingneſs, and earneſt deſire after theſe neareſt degrees of Communion with God: The underſtanding being thus fully enlightened, to diſcern that God is the chiefeſt good, and that mans greateſt happineſs muſt lie in an Union with him, and enjoyment of him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To which I know nothing can be added, but <hi>thoſe meaſures of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience which every renewed Soul hath how good the Lord is.</hi> The experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of any good adds much to our Souls value of it, as it confirmeth to us our notion and apprehenſion of it. Many things appear better to us in contemplation, than in fruition: But there can be nothing in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture conceived, more effectual to inflame our affections after any Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, than when beſides the goodneſs our Underſtandings have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in it, upon which our Wills have made their Election of it, a ſuperadded experience confirmeth our noton of the goodneſs of it. There is no juſtified Soul but hath in ſome meaſure taſted how good the Lord is, and how good a Fellowſhip, and Communion with God is, ſo as it doth but move rationally, in willing and deſiring the neareſt and moſt intimate degrees of it.</p>
               <p>I added further: That this Soul as a mean to obtain it, will uſe
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:61084:75"/>
rightly ordered Prayer. The Reaſon and ground of this evidently appears, if we conſider;</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That Prayer is the means to obtain it.</hi> No man can be ſo much as preſumed truly to will, and to deſire any thing which he uſeth no means to obtain, or as to which he doth not uſe the proper means to obtain it, if he knows it, the good is here is not ſenſible, or ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, to be acquired by <hi>natural</hi> or <hi>moral means,</hi> but is truly and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpiritual; the Communication of the Divine Influences to the Soul, and moſt inward part of man; the means muſt be ſomthing of Divine Inſtitution, ſomthing which God hath appointed as a mean in order to ſo great and bleſſed an end. Prayer is one mean of this Nature. He gives his <hi>holy Spirit to them that ask him,</hi> ſaith our Saviour. This is a Divine Means, under a Divine Ordination, and Inſtitution, with reference to ſuch an end. This the Believer knoweth, and it is a means within his Power. God hath ſent forth the <hi>Spirit of Adoption into his Heart,</hi> teaching him to cry <hi>Abba Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> The Spirit helpeth <hi>his Infirmities</hi> with <hi>ſtrong cries,</hi> and <hi>groans</hi> which cannot be uttered.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He alſo knoweth, that it is not <hi>all Prayer</hi> will be <hi>effective of this,</hi> but <hi>Prayer according to the Will of God, effectual fervent Prayer.</hi> A man may <hi>ask amiſs,</hi> and <hi>not receive.</hi> Though therefore an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite that takes up with a form of Godlineſs, and aims at no right end in his acts of Homage, but drives a by Deſign for himſelf in all his duties, and ſeeketh himſelf more than God, may content himſelf with ſuch performances as anſwer the low mark which he levells his Arrows at: Yet the pious Soul that hath a true aim, and deſign in his Actions, muſt mind ſuch a performance of them as ſhall bear a proportion to the true end he aimeth at; but this is enough to have ſpoken for the Explication and Confirmation of this Propoſition; what this rightly ordered Prayer is, (God willing) I ſhall further open to you in the Application of this Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Uſe 1.</note> From hence in the firſt place we may take ſome meaſures of our State with reference unto God. None of theſe things can truly be ſaid of a wicked man, or formal Hypocrite.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It cannot be ſaid that he is truly willing to have ſuch a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God and Chriſt, as I have been opening and deſcribing to you. They would not have God rule over them; they would have a Chriſt to ſave them from the Wrath to come; but they would not have Chriſt to dwell in their Hearts, to ſubdue their Luſts, no Hypocrite can truly ſay this. They have no deſires after ſuch a
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:61084:75"/>
Communion with Chriſt. Their deſires are all terminated in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. <hi>They ſay to the Almighty depart from us, we deſire not the knowledge of thy ways.</hi> If at any time they pray for any thing of this nature, it is coldly, and lazily, and formally, ſecretly wiſhing they might have no Anſwer to their Prayers. Indeed a true willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, an hearty deſire, and fervent Prayer after this ſpiritual, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, near Communion with God, may I think be truſted to, as a mark of one who is a Chriſtian indeed. It muſt argue a mighty change in the Heart of man, and ſuch a one as no moral Principles, no change upon the meer cultivation of Nature, can be imagined to effect. Here is clearly a good purſued, which no natural man diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth, no natural Underſtanding judgeth, the Eyes of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding muſt firſt be opened. Here muſt be an alteration of the Will of man, the natural bent and inclination of it muſt be changed. This change cannot be from our ſelves, nor from any Creature, but from him alone who giveth to <hi>will,</hi> and to <hi>do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2d Br.</note> Secondly, You may hence obſerve, that it is not a meer willing a near Communion with Chriſt that will evidence a truth of Grace. It muſt be a <hi>willingneſs</hi> declared by <hi>Intenſe deſires,</hi> and attended with <hi>Sutable endeavours.</hi> It is eaſy for men to ſay they are willing Chriſt ſhould Reign over them, and do his will in and upon their Souls when they are really <hi>unwilling.</hi> Yea, there may be a real faint velleity, but attended with a careleſneſs as to the obtaining what we pretend to will. All Grace, habitual Grace is expreſt under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>willing,</hi> God is ſaid to give, <hi>To will</hi> and to <hi>do:</hi> To make his people a <hi>willing people in the day of his power.</hi> There are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes made, to thoſe who are <hi>Willing,</hi> and <hi>obedient.</hi> And If a <hi>man will, let him come and drink of the water of life freely,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> Saith no more than <hi>To will is preſent with me.</hi> But theſe Scriptures muſt not be underſtood of a meerly pretended, and profeſſed willingneſs, nor a faint willingneſs, iſſued in a few Short breathed wiſhes, but of a true and <hi>real willingneſs</hi> diſcovering it ſelf in the intenſe motions of the <hi>Affections,</hi> and the intenſe purſuit of the thing, willed, by the whole man. Such a willingneſs Speaketh a change in the heart and where it is preſent with the Soul is accepted.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Uſe 2.</note> But let us upon this occaſion enter into our hearts, and try our Spiritual State upon this iſſue, <hi>viz. Whether we be truly willing and deſirous</hi> to have this near, inward, conjugal Communion with this glorious Bridegroom. To prove this, the Apoſtle hath expreſſed the Union between Chriſt and the Soul, made by faith in the Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:61084:76" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of a Soul, by the moral Union which in Marriage is betwixt the Husband and Wife, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. from <hi>v.</hi> 25. to the End. We ſhall alſo find that ſtate excellently ſhadowing out the <hi>Communion</hi> which ſhould be, and is betwixt every Soul and Chriſt; I mean every be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Soul.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Husband and Wife are made one fleſh.</hi> Not <hi>eſſentially,</hi> but <hi>morally</hi> this was a piece of the Law of Marriage upon its firſt Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 24. Sutably to this the Apoſtle Speaks. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 26. <hi>He that is joyned to the Lord, is one Spirit.</hi> Believers are by <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid to be made <hi>partakers of the Divine Nature.</hi> Where there is this true Communion between Chriſt and the Soul, there is in his meaſure the <hi>ſame mind</hi> in him tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> was in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> He in the general willeth the ſame things that Chriſt willeth. The Glory of God, the Sanctification and eternal Salvation of his own Soul, and the Souls of others, he can as to the main ſay, <hi>Fiat voluntas mea; mea quia tua.</hi> Let my will be done, mine becauſe thine. If he doth in any thing err, and not will what Chriſt willeth, it is through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, paſſion or infirmity, when he ſeeth his error, his will altereth; hence in our prayers, in things as to which we are not ſure that it is the will of God we ſhould have them, every true Chriſtian, though he may ask for them, prayeth after his <hi>Lord's copy, nevertheleſs not my will but thy will be done.</hi> Canſt thou ſay this? That the ſame Spirit is in thee that was in Chriſt, that in the general, in the main thou willeſt nothing but what Chriſt willeth, that thou art one Spirit with Chriſt?</p>
               <p>Secondly all <hi>Conjugal Communion requires forſaking of Father and mother, Gen.</hi> 2. 24. A forſaking them to that degree, as to dwell with the Husband, ſo as to adhere to the Husband, or Wife in caſe of an oppoſition, this is alſo the Law of this Spiritual Marriage <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 10. <hi>Hearken O Daughter and conſider, and encline thine Ear. Forget alſo thine own people, and thy Fathers Houſe,</hi> The Wife that will maintain duly her Conjugal Communion muſt: 1. <hi>Not dwell in her Fathers houſe if he may not be with her there.</hi> 2. <hi>She muſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the Precepts, Counſels and Advice of her deareſt relations, where it is contrary to the will of her Husband.</hi> She muſt 3. <hi>Forſake them in what they are Enemies and oppoſite to her Husband.</hi> What are our own people? What is our Fathers Houſe? But the world and men of it, the Counſels and Imaginations, and inclinations of our own hearts? A true Chriſtian that is by Faith united to Chriſt is not obliged in order to his or her Communion with him, wholly to
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:61084:76"/>
forſake the world, and caſt off Earthly Friends converſe or relations, he is onely bound <hi>Not to dwell in the world</hi> not to make that his whole buſineſs, but to have his heart in heaven, to uſe the world as if he uſed it not. Not to hearken to the Precepts, Counſels, and Advices of the world contrary to the will of Chriſt. Not to take the worlds part in oppoſition to the Law of Chriſt; thus much the Wives Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal Communion with her Husband, and the Souls Spiritual Conjugal Communion with Chriſt calls to it for, the preference of Chriſts will, both to its own natural Will, and to all the Wills of men.</p>
               <p>Thirdly. Look as in Marriages, the <hi>Communion</hi> following that moral Union requires a <hi>cleaving of the Married Perſons each to other, Gen.</hi> 2. 24. So the Communion that followeth this Myſtical U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion requireth this of every Chriſtian, to cleave unto Chriſt, to his Truths, his Intereſts and Concerns in the World, his Friends, his Will, all that is his. This <hi>cleaving</hi> I underſtand not as reſtrained to the inward motions of the Affections, as it is ſaid, <hi>Sechem's</hi> heart clave to <hi>Dinah:</hi> But I extend it further to all overt Acts, by which this inward Affection may be diſcovered, in the ſame ſenſe as we ſay to our Friends. <hi>I will ſtick to you,</hi> or I will ſtand by you. Chriſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms his part he ſticks, he cleaves to the Believers, in all its Spiritual Combates, and Dangers with, or from, the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil: Thus muſt we cleave to him.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, 'Tis a piece of <hi>Conjugal Communion. That the Wife does nothing but ſhe will firſt acquaint her Husband with it, ask his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, take his Direction.</hi> The Husband alſo imparts much of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel to his Wife: 'Tis a piece of our Communion, true Communion with Chriſt, to do nothing without taking Counſel of him in his Word, without asking his Directions in Prayer, in every difficulty where we have not a clear direction in the Word of God, to fly to him by Prayer and Supplications.</p>
               <p>Are your Souls willing to entertain ſuch a Communion with Chriſt as this is? Are you deſirous of it? Do you pray for it? This ſpeak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth well for the Union betwixt Chriſt and your Souls, nothing leſs than this will.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Uſe 3.</note> This Diſcourſe may be further uſeful to ſome Souls, that it may be cannot ſatisfie themſelves in that Communion which they have with the Lord Jeſus; they would willingly that Chriſt ſhould im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part more of his Loving-kindneſs, and of his Power to their Souls, and they are troubled, that they can no more freely, no more fully
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:61084:77"/>
give up themſelves to him; their Hearts are not united enough to love and fear God, and indeed the beſt Souls are ſeldom ſatisfied in the <hi>Reception of Grace,</hi> or in the <hi>Actings of it.</hi> Now ſuch Souls as are overmuch troubled in this caſe, troubled to that degree as for want of degrees to ſuſpect all the truth of Grace in their Souls. This may be ſome ſatisfaction to hear, that it ſpeaks a Soul to be the Spouſe of Chriſt to be truly willing, ſincerely deſirous, much in Prayer for thoſe degrees of neareſt Communion with Chriſt which it ſtands in need of. In Earthly Marriages three things are required, 1. <hi>Conſent of Parties.</hi> 2. <hi>Conſent of Parents.</hi> 3. <hi>Publication of it to the World.</hi> The firſt alone is eſſential to the Union. The ſecond to make it a perfectly lawful Act. The third only to <hi>avoid Scandal</hi> and to keep up Civil Order in the World. In the Spiritual Marriage <hi>the Conſent of Parties makes the Union.</hi> Chriſts Conſent to be united to thy Soul, is evidenced in his Word declared by us, who are his <hi>Proxies to eſpouſe you to this Husband.</hi> If thy Soul alſo truly conſents, if thou truly deſireſt this Union, and that Communion which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth and ought to follow it, the Match is made, thou art joined to the Lord, though it may be there be not a Publication of it to thy own Soul, much leſs to the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Uſe 4.</note> I ſhall conclude with a Word of Exhortation, <hi>To labour for this evidence of Grace.</hi> That you may be truly willing to, truly deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of ſuch a Communion with Chriſt, as I have been deſcribing. You that are yet ſtrangers to it, labour for the beginnings of it. You that find any thing of it, labour to uphold it, and labour for the Perfection of it. To the firſt, by way of Counſel, I would only ſpeak a few things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Labour to be convinced of your ſad condition, till Grace hath brought you into this better State.</hi> Chriſt told the Woman of <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> ſhe had had many Husbands, and he whom ſhe then enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was not her Husband. Unregenerate Men have many Paramours; for there is no Soul but cleaveth to ſomthing, one mans Heart clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth to his Pleaſures, another to his Profits, but all theſe are not the reaſonable Souls Husbands, the Soul cannot feed upon theſe things. Let a Woman be married to a Man, and run away from him ſhe may have another Paramour, but he is not her Husband. It is Mans Caſe; he was in Creation united to God, he is run away from God, and followeth many Lovers, but none of theſe are the Souls Husbands. O therefore return to your firſt Husband, what can you imagine God ſhould do for any of your Souls, more than any
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:61084:77"/>
one of you would do for a Wife, that had run away from you, and clave to another man.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Look as the Woman that wanteth her Husband, hath none that ſo naturally careth for her, none that will be a covering to her Head, or a Light to her Eyes, ſo neither hath the Soul in its ſtate of diſunion with God, any that will care for it, as to its Spiritual and Eternal Concerns. I might add the infinite advantages of this Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Communion; I remember the Argument uſed by <hi>Hamor</hi> and <hi>Sechem,</hi> to perſuade their People into a Willingneſs to be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, that <hi>Sechem</hi> might be married into <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Family. <hi>Shall not</hi> (ſay they) <hi>their Cattle, and Subſtance, and all that they have be ours,</hi> only <hi>conſent</hi> to them? <hi>Shall not the Grace,</hi> and <hi>Glory,</hi> and <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt</hi> be yours, only conſent to him, and be willing to a Communion with him? But it is the Lord that muſt <hi>perſuade</hi> Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>to come, and to dwell in the Tents of</hi> Shem. <hi>No man comes to the Son but he whom the Father draweth;</hi> and while there is a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Union, it is unreaſonable to think there ſhould be any <hi>Willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> in a Soul to any near Communion with Chriſt. We may uſe Arguments with Souls eſtranged from God, to reconcile them to him, and it is our Duty ſo to do; till God concurreth with the work of his Spirit they will be of no force.</p>
               <p>Let me therefore turn to ſuch with whom this <hi>myſtical Union</hi> is made. Nor ſhall I need uſe words with any ſuch, to perſuade them to a <hi>conſent</hi> or <hi>willingneſs</hi> to, or deſire of this near Communion with Chriſt which I have been diſcourſing; there is no ſuch Soul but muſt be willing, muſt be deſirous of it: But there is none of them which hath <hi>attained,</hi> there's no ſuch Soul but hath attained ſomthing, nor any that hath attained to Perfection, none but may receive from Chriſt more than it hath received, none but deſireth his Heart might be more in ſubjection to Chriſt than it is. The way further to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain is Prayer, rightly ordered Prayer. It is the Spouſe that ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the Text, ſhe had attained, ſhe was already united to her Spiritual Bridegroom; but yet ſhe finds her Soul in a continuing need of his Influences, and further Tokens for good to be ſhewed unto her, for theſe ſhe uſeth Prayer as an appoſite means. Only we may ask and not receive, becauſe we ask amiſs. Let us look over the form of the Spouſes Petition, and ſee what we may learn from thence to guide our Souls in our Applications to God.</p>

be tranſlated, <hi>Let him kiſs me,</hi> or <hi>He ſhall,</hi> or <hi>will kiſs me</hi> with the Kiſſes of his Mouth. <hi>Her Prayer was the Prayer of Faith.</hi> This is a prime requiſite in all our Prayers to God. <hi>Math.</hi> 21. 22. <hi>And all things whatſoever you ſhall ask in Prayer believing, you ſhall receive.</hi> Jam. 5. 15. <hi>The Prayer of Faith ſaveth the ſick. He</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>that cometh unto God muſt believe that he is, and that he is a Rewarder of thoſe that ſeek him.</hi> Nor is that Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Faith enough for that Soul that goeth to God, for any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Mercy, there muſt be a more particular Faith, both as to Gods <hi>Power,</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> with reference to that good thing, that <hi>God is able</hi> to do that thing for him: yea and willing alſo ſo far as in his infinite Wiſdom he ſhall ſee it good. When the blind men had come to Chriſt begging Mercy, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. 27, 28. (ſaith he) <hi>Believe you that I'am able to do this?</hi> They ſaid, <hi>Yea Lord,</hi> then he <hi>touched their Eyes.</hi> Nay the <hi>Prayer of Faith</hi> ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth more, a <hi>truſting and relying on God for the doing</hi> of the thing we ask. It is very much to obſerve how much the holy Scripture layeth upon this with Reference to the hearing and anſwering our Prayers. Jam. 1 5. <hi>If any of you lack Wiſdom let him ask of God: But</hi> (v. 6.) <hi>let him ask in Faith, nothing wavering:</hi> According to your Faith (ſaith Chriſt) ſo be it to you. The Unregenerate man cannot ask in Faith, he wants the Habit, his Soul is ſhut up in Unbelief, and Gods Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may be too guilty of not asking in <hi>Faith,</hi> giving too much way to temptations, and hearkening too much to the jealouſies and ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their own Souls.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, The Spouſes Phraſe ſpeaks an</hi> holy boldneſs. He ſhall kiſs me with the Kiſſes of his Mou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h, <hi>Indeed this differs but gradually from the other it muſt be a</hi> boldneſs of Faith, <hi>and in this Senſe we are to come boldly to the</hi> Throne of Grace. <hi>Eph. 3. 12.</hi> We have boldneſs and acceſs with confidence, through the Faith of him. <hi>Hence</hi> Heb. <hi>4. 16.</hi> Let us therefore come boldly unto the Throne of Grace, that we may obtain Mercy, and find Grace to help in a time of need.</p>
               <p>Thirdly <hi>The abrup<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>neſs of the Phraſe ſpeaketh Paſſion, and Ferven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ey. The fervent Prayer of the Righteous availeth much.</hi> Jam 5. 16. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, The <hi>working Prayer</hi> When the whole Soul is in Prayer ſet on work, the <hi>Underſtanding</hi> diſcerning the good the Soul prayeth for, diſcerning God able to give it, and willing alſo, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Promiſe by which God hath made himſelf a Debter to the Creature for it. The <hi>Will</hi> in willing it, the <hi>Affections</hi> in intenſe deſires of it. Men may pray, and their Souls be hardly ſet at work
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:61084:78"/>
at all, only they ſo far as it influenceth the Eye to ſee Words in a Book, or the Underſtanding to invent Words which the Tongue may utter. This Prayer ſignifies little, it is the fervent working Prayer that availeth much, when the whole Soul is at work, wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with God as <hi>Jacob</hi> did, that it may receive the Bleſſing.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The form of the Word ſpeaks <hi>Reverence: Let him kiſs me.</hi> O that it might pleaſe the Lord to kiſs me, (ſo much the Phraſe ſounds in our Dialect.) In all our Service of God, he requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth Reverence and a godly Fear. He that dareth not to come to God, but doubteth whether he may preſume to ask of him, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the Lords goodneſs, he that dares to come without <hi>Reverence</hi> knoweth not the Lords Majeſty, and Greatneſs. As <hi>boldneſs</hi> and Confidence without doubting, becomes us with reſpect to his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Love, and Faithfulneſs, ſo Fear and Reverence becomes us with reference to the Greatneſs and Majeſty of the Divine Being.</p>
               <p>Laſtly her Speech ſpeaketh <hi>Modeſty:</hi> She asketh but a <hi>Kiſs.</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty is not oppoſite to an holy Boldneſs in Prayer. She perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily asks ſomthing which might ſpeak his <hi>ſpecial peculiar Love:</hi> Yet there is a modeſty imported in her words, in that ſhe asketh no more than the <hi>Kiſſes of his Mouth.</hi> In three things we ſhould ſhew a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty in Prayer, if it be rightly ordered.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>In the asking the good things of this Life, with a due Submiſſion to the Will and Wiſdom of God.</hi> It ſpeaketh too much boldneſs with God, to be too importunate for things that are not abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and infallibly good for us under all circumſtances. It is enough for us that God hath promiſed to withhold from us no good thing. We prefer our own to the Divine Wiſdom, in ſuch importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the asking of <hi>Spiritual Mercys</hi> Modeſty ought to be ſhewed alſo, in <hi>ſubmitting our ſelves to the VVill of God,</hi> as to <hi>Diſpenſations,</hi> or <hi>Degrees of gracious</hi> Manifeſtations, not abſolutely neceſſary; they may be asked, but they ought to be asked with limitations; if God ſeeth they be good for us, if he that knoweth our Hearts, ſeeth that we will uſe them for his Glory, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In not <hi>preſcribing time to God, as to the granting of thoſe things, which are not in the preſent time neceſſary.</hi> We ought to believe God wiſer than our ſelves, and to limit our Requeſts by the Terms of his Promiſe, to beg the things which God hath promiſed, upon the Terms which he hath promiſed.</p>

               <p>Prop. <hi>That Chriſt hath Loves. There are Loves in Chriſt.</hi> He is not onely lovely, and ſo the object of our Love, the <hi>chiefeſt of Ten thouſand;</hi> but he is <hi>Loving,</hi> and we are the Obiects of his Love.

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:61084:79"/>
2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19. That <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the World to himſelf.</hi> God in Chriſt is <hi>Love</hi> toward poor Creatures. There are <hi>Loves</hi> in him. Let me a little open the Term. I deſire you to take notice of Two things. 1. <hi>That it is Spoken in the Abſtract;</hi> 2. <hi>In the plural number,</hi> not Love but Loves.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Love</hi> in the ſtrict, and proper Notion of it, ſignifieth the Perſons or the Creatures <hi>Propenſion</hi> and <hi>Inclination</hi> to <hi>ſome Object, and its Complacency</hi> in it. And in this Abſtract, and purer Notion of it, it agreeth to the Divine Being, and Chriſt is the Subject of Love, There is in the eternal Son of God, ſtrong Propenſions and Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to do good to the Sons of men. To love, the Philoſopher ſaith, is <hi>Velle bonum;</hi> to will good to another: There is in Chriſt a Propenſion a ſtrong Inclination to will good to the Sons of Men; He hath a Complacency in ſome of the Sons of Men. Love is a Term that ſignifies <hi>Affections,</hi> and all our Affections are but the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our Wills towards their Objects. We ſay, there are no <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections in God:</hi> That is true; But there is ſomething in the Divine Being, which is proportionable to what in us we call <hi>Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions.</hi> In us Affections are extravagant Motions, mutable Paſſions; there are no ſuch things in God: In us ſomthing out of our ſelves draws out our Love. There is no ſuch <hi>Paſſions and Affections</hi> in God: But if we conſider Love in its pure Nature, as it is the <hi>kind motion of the VVill to an Object,</hi> ſo <hi>Chriſt is Love,</hi> and he hath Loves; that is, there is in him, pure and admirable Propenſions and Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of his Will to do good to the Children of Men, eſpecially to ſome particular Souls amongſt the Sons of Men. Theſe indeed are not kindled in the Divine Being, from any thing in us, or out of itſelf, as Flames of Love in the Creature uſually are: Yet even in Creatures <hi>Love</hi> oftentimes is an inaccountable thing, but in God it is always ſo; he ſheweth Mercy <hi>becauſe he will ſhew Mercy,</hi> and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth freely. That's the firſt thing.</p>
               <p>But Secondly, The word is <hi>plural,</hi> not <hi>Love</hi> but <hi>Loves.</hi> God is one, and his <hi>Love is one,</hi> Chriſts Love is one in himſelf, but as the River, that went out of <hi>Eden</hi> to water the Garden of <hi>Paradiſe</hi> Gen. 2. 10. was one in its Original, and Source, <hi>but from thence it was parted, and became into four Heads.</hi> So that O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eneſs of the Divine Propenſion and Inclination to do good to poor Creatures, being out of the Divine Being it divides itſelf into many Heads, and as the Sea which is one in itſelf, yet as it paſſeth by ſeveral Lands and waſheth upon various Shoa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

number; ſo the <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which in him is but one <hi>Good-will</hi> to poor Creatures; yet as it ſheweth itſelf, in Serving the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of various Souls, or the various neceſſities of the ſame Soul, ſo it becomes <hi>Loves,</hi> and admits of plurality, there is in Chriſt <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning Love,</hi> and an <hi>healing Love,</hi> a <hi>ſtrengthening Love.</hi> and a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting Love;</hi> therefore the Spouſe ſaith <hi>Thy Loves.</hi> There is but <hi>One Love</hi> in Chriſt, but it becomes many when it waſheth upon va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Shoars, and toucheth our diverſe wants.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The <hi>plural Number</hi> ſpeaketh the <hi>Dimenſions of that Love which is in Chriſt,</hi> or rather the want of D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>renſions in it. The <hi>plural number</hi> hath no bounds, the ſingular is bounded by Unity, but the plural hath no bounds, if you be to expreſs Millions of Millions of Millions, 'tis all ſtill but the plural number. <hi>Loves</hi> reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth infiniteneſs. When the Spouſe ſaith, <hi>Thy Loves,</hi> it is as much as thine infinite, unmeaſurable Love, Chriſt hath not only a good Will, a kind Inclination, and Propenſion to the Sons of Men, but an infinite, unmeaſurable, unfathomable Propenſion and Inclination to do good to the Souls of his Saints. The Apoſtle prayeth for the <hi>Epheſians.</hi> Eph. 3. 17, 18. <hi>That Chriſt might dwell in their Hearts by Faith, that they being rooted and grounded in Love, might be able to comprehend with all Saints, what is the bredth, and length, and, depth, and beighth, and to know the Love of Chriſt which paſſeth knowledge, heighth,</hi> and <hi>depth,</hi> and <hi>length,</hi> and <hi>bredth,</hi> are the boundaries of our knowledge but the Love of Chriſt paſſeth know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Love ſignifies ſome <hi>Specialties of Affection.</hi> A good man hath Love for many Women, but <hi>Love</hi>'s only for the Wife of his Boſom. Loves ſignifie both a common, and a ſingular and ſpecial Love. Chriſt hath a <hi>Philanthropy,</hi> or common Love for all the Sons of Men, but he hath an <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a ſpecial Love and Kindneſs for ſome. <hi>Joſeph</hi> cauſed all his Brethren, to have a Meſs ſet them, but for <hi>Benjamin,</hi> a double Meſs. God gave <hi>Eſau</hi> the <hi>Mountains of Edom.</hi> There was Love, but <hi>Jacob</hi> had the Bleſſing, <hi>Eſau</hi> had his Love, <hi>Jacob</hi> had his Loves. That the Goſpel is preached to every Creature, is from Chriſts Love, but that any by the Goſpel are made <hi>New crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> this is from his <hi>Loves.</hi> It is kindneſs to them that they have the Goſpel, but a far greater kindneſs, a kindneſs of another nature to the Soul that it is inabled to receive the Goſpel, and is turned into the likneſs of it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Loves</hi> may ſignify the <hi>Effects, and indications of Love,</hi> and indeed
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:61084:80"/>
Terms of Affection applyed unto God, do very ordinarily in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſignify this, <hi>Et affectum, &amp; effectum;</hi> Both the Motion of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Will within itſelf, and the effect of it, upon the Creature. So it is true, that Chriſt hath <hi>Loves,</hi> his Good-Will to poor Creatures doth not exhauſt itſelf in one or another Emanation, in one or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Stream, but in various Emanations, in a multitude of Streams, and thus you ſee there are two things in the Propoſition aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1ſt.</hi> That in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, there is an infinite, unmeaſurable Good-Will to the Childr of Men, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

               <p>Theſe are the two Points I have to prove, and they, are of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding eaſy demonſtration, to thoſe who believe the Hiſtory of the Goſpel, or the Matter, and Propoſitions of the whole Word of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us of Chriſt under the notion of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> (the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle calls Chriſt <hi>The VViſdom of God,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 24.) that before <hi>ever the Earth was,</hi> when there <hi>were no Depths</hi> nor <hi>Fountains a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding with VVater,</hi> when God prepared the Heavens, and ſet a compaſs upon the face of the Deep, when he eſtabliſhed the Clouds, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 24. 25. 31. <hi>He was Rejoycing in the habitable part of his Earth, and his Delights were with the Sons of Men.</hi> The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle tells thoſe of the <hi>Epheſians</hi> who were Saints and faithful, <hi>That they were choſen in Chriſt before the Foundation of the VVorld, that they ſhould be holy, and without blame before him, in Love, predeſtinated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Adoption of Children, by Jeſus Chriſt to himſelf, according to the good pleaſure of his VVill.

I ſay what do all theſe things ſignify from him who needeth not his creature, being over all God bleſſed for ever, but that he hath loves, an infinite good will to the Children of men? No man is at coſt, taketh pains in any buſineſs, ſuffereth hard things to go through it, but either out of kindneſs to himſelf or to another. Our Lord did not do, and ſuffer theſe things for himſelf, he had no need of them, if it were for us it ſpeaks his loves.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But this is no more than what every one who owneth Chriſt, and the Goſpel will eaſily grant, That <hi>Chriſt is Love</hi> and hath a Love for the Sons of men, yea and that there is an infiniteneſs, and unmeaſurableneſs in the Love of Chriſt. But that he hath <hi>Loves</hi> in the Other ſenſe: Some <hi>Specialties of Love,</hi> ſome particular propenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to ſome Souls more than others; this is what the proud world cannot ſo eaſily digeſt.

               <p n="3">3. Neither doth this grate ſo much. The moſt perverſe opiners in this point muſt grant the publication of the Goſpel, an <hi>effect</hi> of the <hi>Love of Chriſt,</hi> and that there is a very inequal diſtribution of it by

This is not from any <hi>Loves in Chriſt,</hi> he his alike to all, but from the differing motions and inclinations of the will of man. I yet ask, Whence is it? Seing human Souls are Equal and have the ſame powers, and faculties, how comes it that one man <hi>loveth God,</hi> and the ways of God, another hates and abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth every thing almoſt that hath the image and Superſcription of God upon it? Is a man a God to himſelf and the firſt cauſe of any motions that are truly and ſpiritually good? Is it not God that giveth to will, and to do, of his own good pleaſure? Hath a man any thing which is good which he hath not received? If one hath received ſuch a power, ſuch an inclination, ſuch a diſpoſition from God, there is Special Love; then Chriſt hath Loves beſides a common <hi>Philanthropy,</hi> a good will to the generality of mankind, ſhewed in other things which will not bring Souls to Eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he hath a ſpecial Love and kindneſs to ſome Souls, which he manifeſteth in ſuch diſpenſations to it, as ſhall certainly bring the Soul to Eternal Life and Salvation; and theſe are thoſe of which the text Speaks.</p>
               <p>But I have Spoken enough in evidence of ſo plain a Propoſition as this is. I come to the application.</p>

Chriſt hath ſo judged of it, he told ſome of the firſt Miniſter s of his Goſpel, Math. 10. 14, 15. <hi>That in the day of Judgment it ſhould be more tolerable for</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Gomorrha <hi>than for thoſe that did not receive them, and hear his words.</hi> Wicked men, and Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the Goſpel are in Scripture called <hi>unreaſonable men,</hi> 2.

We ſhall ſometimes find in men and women a ſtrange a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion from ſuch as truly Love them, they cannot get up their hearts, to love a man, or woman, that Loves them, but it is very brutiſh, very unreaſonable for any of us to hate, and malign, and to ſeek to deſtroy one that Loves us. Such brutes are all thoſe that are Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to Chriſt and his Goſpel. Chriſt hath Loves for us, theſe Loves are declared in his Goſpel, that declareth God in Chriſt recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling the world to himſelf not imputing their ſins; the publication of the Goſpel, is a great act of this Love, the faithful Miniſters of the Goſpel, are the Meſſengers to publiſh this Love; what an unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thing it is now for men to make them the But of their malice? I remember when the Jews cryed out concerning Chriſt, <hi>Crucify him, Crucify him,</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> asked them, why? <hi>What evil hath he done?</hi> They like a company of unreaſonable bruits could give him no anſwer, but ſtill they cryed out the more, <hi>Crucify him, Crucify him.</hi> Doth not the ſame brutiſh cry hold up even at this day in ſome wretches mouths. They can give no reaſonable account why they ſhould oppoſe the publication of the Love of Chriſt to poor loſt Sinners, yet they do it with a rage reaching up to Heaven. This is now to be unreaſonable men. why ſhould you perſecute him who lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth you. Yet verily as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid of himſelf <hi>The</hi> more <hi>he loved the Galathians the leſs he was beloved of them,</hi> So it feareth with Chriſt, and all that hath relation to him the more faithful the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Chriſt is in preaching the Goſpel, the more diligent, and zealous he is to gain Souls to Chriſt, the moſt hated he is, and the reaſon is becauſe it thus fared with Chriſt. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 18. If <hi>the world hateth you, you know it hated me before it hated you.</hi> But Oh let this reconcile your hearts unto Chriſt. <hi>That he hath Loves.</hi> No ingenuous man but will repay Love for Love.

Men cannot be his Diſciples, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they deny themſelves, mortify their Members. Others are drawn after the World, and are not at leaſure to come to Chriſt; and beſides, the friendſhip of the World is enmity with God!

When thy thoughts are overwhelm'd in the thoughts of thy ſins, ſink them again into the thoughts of Chriſts Loves, thou wilt find that is as great a depth as the other is; Yea thou will find the ſame diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence as betwixt the Shore, and the main Sea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Near the Shore the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riner may find it ſeveral fathom water enough to drown a man: But off at Sea, he finds himſelf out of the ſoundings, all the lines he hath will find no bottom So a Soul in the thoughts of his ſins may find himſelf beyond his depth, he is drowned in the thoughts of them. Ah but yet there is a Sounding, his Sins are not Infinite; ſo there is a ſounding, but if he lancheth his thoughts into the depths of Gods grace, and Chriſts Loves, there is no ſoundings, let therefore no Soul be diſcouraged from coming unto Chriſt.</p>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>As love ſtands oppoſed to hatred, and wrath, and Enmity.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering man as Gods Creature, he was not hated of God, God h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

We were <hi>Children of wrath</hi> by nature ſaith the Apoſtle, E ph. 2. 3. <hi>God is angry with the wicked every day,</hi> How Sutable, to us now is it, to have a <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our?</hi> That is <hi>Love,</hi> and who hath Loves, conſidering the averſion

in the holy Divine Beeing, from Mankind as rebellious Seed, a Seed of Evil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>doers? Who could have ſuited us to have become a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our unto us, but one who had akind propenſion, and inclination to us, inclining him to the great work of mans Redemption, and Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation to God, eſpecially alſo conſidering, that there could be no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins without blood, no reconciliation without the reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers Death, he had need have loves that ſhould dye for his Friend, and he much more who ſhould dye for Enemies that were by his death to be made friends.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As <hi>Loves ſignifies multitude,</hi> and <hi>infinitneſs of Love.</hi> We have all a multitude of ſins, and there is a kind of infiniteneſs in ſin; indeed our Acts of Sin are not infinite, we cannot number them, we cannot meaſure them, but they are to be numbred, that is our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; ſo that the ballance is on Gods ſide, he hath infinite Mercies. But there is an infiniteneſs of a will to ſin in every Sinners heart, if a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner were let alone he hath ſuch a depth of vileneſs in his heart, that if he were to live infinitely he would ſin without limits, without bounds, infinitely; there is an infiniteneſs in the guilt of Sin, we had need of a Saviour that ſhould have Loves, an infinite of Love, a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Mercies for our multitude of Sins, numberleſs pardons for numberleſs Sinnings; we Sinned yeſterday, we ſin this day, and we ſhall ſin to morrow If Chriſt had not <hi>Loves,</hi> we could have no hopes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly ſuch a Saviour became us. <hi>As Loves ſignifyes a Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety</hi> of <hi>gracious</hi> inclinations. We have a variety of wants, Our wants are not all of one nature, we have need of Love to <hi>pardon us</hi> and to bring us into a ſtate of favour, Love to preſerve us, and uphold us when we are in ſuch a ſtate of favour, One or another gracious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and inclination of Chriſt, would not have been enough for our Souls, which are not onely miſerable, and ſtand in need of mercy, but <hi>poor,</hi> and ſtand in need of the riches of divine grace, and <hi>naked,</hi> and ſtand in need of the long White robe of Chriſts righteouſneſs, and <hi>blind,</hi> and ſtand in need of his <hi>Eye Salve.</hi> We are all Emptineſs, and ſtand in need of his fulneſs that we might receive of his fulneſs, Grace for Grace.

you before, that this text doth not ſpeak of the <hi>Love of Chriſt,</hi> with reſpect to his <hi>Father</hi> but with reſpect to us, to the Sons of men; they are the objects of the <hi>Loves of Chriſt</hi> here mentioned. How ſhould we all ſtudy and indeavour that we may be the Beloved, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of theſe Loves, not of his Love onely, but of his Loves. <hi>Arminians</hi> keep a great deal of ſtir with a <hi>Philanthropy</hi> in Chriſt, a common Love, which he hath for all the Sons, and daughters of men. Nor is the queſtion betwixt them, and other Divines ſo much about the thing, as the extent of it. Sober Divines will (many of them) grant in Chriſt a <hi>common Love to all mankind</hi> and ſpeak of ſome things which they take to be the effects, and products of it; but admit it, yet it is certain he hath alſo an <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a good pleaſure of his will, or Special kindneſs to ſome Souls. So he hath Loves; that is, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity, and kindneſs of his inclinations is more to Some than to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Let none of us ſatisfy our ſelves to be the Object of <hi>Chriſts Love,</hi> unleſs we be the <hi>object of his Loves.</hi> I ſhall preſs this onely with One Argument. It is this; <hi>Nothing but the Loves of Chriſt can ſerve our Souls as to their true Spiritual and eternal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment.</hi> There is a great ſtir made in the world, about a common Love which Chriſt ſhould have for all the Sons, and daughters of men, and there are many that would make the <hi>Death of Chriſt</hi> to be the Effect of this <hi>Common Love.</hi> And ſo conclude that he intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally <hi>dyed for all and Every man.</hi> Others are not of that mind, but yet will allow, all men and women in the world to receive ſome good from Chriſt and that not onely conſidered as <hi>God over all bleſſed for ever,</hi> and one with his <hi>Father,</hi> and ſo in him we live, move and have our Being; But as <hi>Mediator.</hi> It is from him they ſay, that the world yet ſtands, that the <hi>Goſpel is preached to the worſt of men.</hi> I ſee little in this worth the contending for. I would gladly know what real advantage accrueth to any Soul from being the common object of Divine Love? Admitting that all ſhal! not be ſaved for whom Chriſt dyed (which they muſt hold who hold that Chriſt dyed for all and every man, unleſs they hold univerſal Salvation) I would fain know what relief any Soul can have from this notion of <hi>Chriſts dying for all</hi> which ſome ſo much contend for? Suppoſing that all men ſhall not be ſaved, but thoſe onely, whom Chriſt hath loved with a <hi>Special Love?</hi> Nothing can poſſibly revive a Soul troubled as to its Spiritual, and eternal concerns, but ſome evidence of that. It is ſaid of the young man who came to Chriſt ſo hopefully, <hi>Mar.</hi> 10. 21. <hi>kneeling</hi> to him, &amp; ſaying, <hi>Maſter what good thing may I do that I</hi>

                  <hi>may obtain everlaſting Life; that he loved him.</hi> With that general Love which he hath for all his Creatures eſpecially ſuch as have any ſeeds of goodneſs in them; yet the Text ſaith he <hi>went away Sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</hi> Let us labour for the Special Love of Chriſt: Such tokens of his Love as may diſtinguiſh betwixt us and thoſe who ſhall periſh.</p>

There are two <hi>Loves,</hi> which are much our duty upon this view of our great <hi>Lord and Maſter,</hi> 1. <hi>Love to him.</hi> 2 <hi>Love to our Neighbours,</hi> eſpecially thoſe in whom any thing of Chriſts appears.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It calls to us for <hi>Loves to Chriſt.</hi> This in point of gratitude; <hi>If</hi> (Saith our Saviour) <hi>you love them which love you, what reward have you? Do not even the Publicanes the ſame?</hi> Our Love to Chriſt is but a Love to him who hath Loves for us, and indeed this ſpeaketh to all men for Love to him, but more eſpecially, <hi>O Love ye the Lord, all you his Saints.</hi> It is the opinion of great Divines, that all the world is beholden to Chriſt as Mediator, that from his Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there iſſueth ſome good to the worſt of men. But he hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently extended his Love to his Saints, he hath loved them with a ſingular Love. If there ſhould be Love wanting in their hearts to Chriſt they ſhould be of all men, and women in the world moſt inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable, what could he have done for any of the Sons of Men which he hath not done for them? What greater thing could they have asked of him, then he hath prevented them in asking? O Love you the Lord all you they that believe. Do you ask me how you ſhould ſhew your Love to him? The firſt motions of Love are in the heart; Love there is ſeen in delighting in him, breathing after him. It next ſhews itſelf by the lips Speaking well of him to others, defending his intereſt, and concern in the world. If we come to more external acts; That of <hi>David,</hi> Pſ. 16. 2. 3. is true here, <hi>O my Soul thou haſt ſaid unto the Lord thou art my Lord, my goodneſs extendeth not to thee, but to the Saints that are in the earth, to the excellent on whom is all my delight.</hi> Our Love to Chriſt muſt be ſeen in our actings in our ſtations for the honour, glory, and concern of Chriſt in the world. In our kindneſs to the poor flock of Chriſt. Chriſt calls a want of Love to them a want of Love to himſelf 25. <hi>Math.</hi> But that brings me to the Second with a ſhort diſcourſe upon which I ſhall ſhut up this diſcourſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It calls you for <hi>Love to men</hi> eſpecially to thoſe in whom you ſee any thing of Chriſt. The argument for this ariſeth from our

There alſo lyeth an obligation upon usfrom the law of Chriſt and from this great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, to be kindly affectionate toward all, There lyeth alſo a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept upon us to <hi>do good to all.</hi> And again ſaith the Apoſtle. <hi>Owe nothing to any, but this; That you love one another.</hi> Indeed there is not the ſame degree of affection, nor the ſame acts of Love due to all (as to that we muſt be ruled by the Word of God,) but <hi>Love</hi> is a debt upon us which is due to all men.

Do good to all</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) but <hi>eſpecially to the houſhold of Faith.</hi> The Soul of every Member of Chriſt ſhould cleave to theſe, with whom he is united, not onely by a <hi>common nature</hi> (being the ſame fleſh and blood with him) but by a <hi>common faith,</hi> by the ligament of Members of the ſame body, whereof Chriſt is the head. Give me leave to preſs this the more upon this argument becauſe I find the Apoſtle St. <hi>John</hi> preſſing it upon the ſame Topick, 1. <hi>John.</hi> 4. 11. <hi>If God ſo loved us we ought alſo to Love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> v. 12.—<hi>If we love one another God dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in us,</hi> v. 16. He tells us that <hi>God is love</hi> and <hi>he that dwelleth in Love dwelling in God.</hi> Every good Chriſtian may ſee much more in the meaneſt, pooreſt true Chriſtian to ingage him to Love him or her, than Chriſt could ever ſee in the higheſt Saint to oblige or move Chriſt to love him or her. <hi>When thou wallowedſt in thy blood,</hi> when thou hadſt nothing of the lineament of a Saint in thy Soul not ſo much as a line of any Spiritual Goodneſs, he paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by thee, and it was with him a time of Love as to thy Soul; there is not a child of God in the world, but there is ſomthing of holineſs, and righteouſneſs, ſomething of the image and Superſcription of Chriſt to be ſeen in his Soul, ſomething of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature reſplendent in his Soul. It may be there is more in ſome, leſs in others, but there is in all ſome. When thou haſt a temptation upon thee to averſate thy brother, or to turn away thy heart, or head,

or hand from him. O <hi>remember</hi> Chriſt hath loves and <hi>and he that dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in Love dwelleth in him.</hi> And that it is he whoſe heart is full of of <hi>Loves</hi> for thee who hath commanded thee to Love thy Brother. But I have ſpoken e nough to this firſt Propoſition.</p>

               <p>IN my laſt diſcourſe I ſhewed you that <hi>Chriſt hath Loves,</hi> kind affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and inclinations to the Children of men and more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to the Souls of his Saints, which he is ready to declare and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, yea hath already expreſſed in acts of kindneſs, and theſe not of one but various kinds, ſuted to the reſpective neceſſities of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, a ſalve for every Sore, a Supply for every want. I come now to ſhew you the quality of his <hi>Loves,</hi> which in my Text is ſet down <hi>poſitively,</hi> and comparatively. In our tranſlation according to our Idioms or propriety of Speech the poſitive is to be underſtood in the comparative particle. A thing cannot be called <hi>better</hi> than another, unleſs it hath ſome poſitive abſolute goodneſs in it ſelf, but in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> it is more plainly expreſſed. That ſaith, <hi>Are good before Wine.</hi> (It is their way of expreſſing comparatives.) It makes no difference in the ſenſe. <hi>Good before Wine. And better than wine,</hi> are phraſes of the ſame ſenſe. In the Explication of the Text I told you that though Wine ſtrictly ſignifies the juice of the Grape, yet by a <hi>Synechdoche</hi> here it ſignifyeth all created goods what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever can be ſweet or profitable or advantageous to us. The Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is plainly this.</p>
               <p>Prop. <hi>The Loves of Chriſt are good befo e</hi> [or better than] <hi>all created comforts, and enjoyments whatever.</hi> I have already ſhewed you what the <hi>Loves of Chriſt</hi> ſignify, <hi>viz.</hi> His good will, his kind affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and inclinations to the Souls of men. Of theſe here the Spou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:61084:86"/>
predicates. 1. <hi>A goodneſs.</hi> 2. A tranſcendent and excelling goodneſs. My work muſt be to demonſtrate both. 1. <hi>That they are good.</hi> 2. <hi>That they are good before wine,</hi> before all Sublunary goods, all created comforts of what nature ſoever. 1. That they are good.</p>
               <p>The true nature of all good lyes in the conveniency and Sutable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of things which we ſo call to ſome wants, and neceſſities that we have and lye under. Hence the Philoſopher deſcribes <hi>Good</hi> to be the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of our deſires, what all men deſire, for we deſire no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but in order to the ſupply of ſome want or other that we are ſenſible, and apprehenſive of. A man may indeed deſire what is not good, but he muſt apprehend ſome goodneſs in the thing which he deſireth. So that to demonſtrate the <hi>loves of Chriſt</hi> to be good, there needs no more than to prove them <hi>convenient,</hi> and admirably Suited to ſome thing which we want to Supply us in that want. That I may reſtrain my diſcourſe to the <hi>Loves</hi> of Chriſt as <hi>mediator,</hi> I ſhall only premiſe, what I hope you all believe: That we have Souls as well as Bodies, the Soul is an eſſential part of man, and as much excelling and better than the Body, as the body is better than rayment This admitted, whatſoever ſuiteth the <hi>Soules wants</hi> muſt neceſſarily be <hi>good</hi> and eminently good. The Souls wants are many, but its principal wants are reducible to five heads. 1. <hi>Pardon, Righteouſneſs, Peace, Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Hopes, or aſſurance of Eternal life and Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. It wanteth <hi>pardon of Sin.</hi> This is a want which the Soul brought into the world with it, it was by nature dead in treſpaſſes and Sins, conceived in Sin, brought forth in iniquity, a Child of <hi>wrath by nature Eph.</hi> 2, 3. This want hath grown upon the Soul from the day of its birth. Its Child-hood and youth were alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vanity; who knows the Errours of his life? The righteous falls ſeven times a day, who can tell how often he offendeth? It is true, not one of many is ſenſible of this want, but that only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth their miſery. It is certain this is a great want of a Soul, Chriſt elſe had never directed us to pray, <hi>Forgive us our debts.</hi> There is a debt of ten thouſand Talents, upon every Soul, that hath not taſted of Chriſts pardoning grace. That it is not arreſted for it proceeds only from Gods patience, who ſometimes beareth long with veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of wrath fitted for deſtruction. The Love of Chriſt is Suited to this want. It is he that forgiveth Sins and waſheth the Soul from the guilt of ſin with his blood. <hi>He dyed for our ſins</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle.)
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:61084:86"/>
He was wounded for our tranſgreſſions, and bruiſed for our iniquities ſaith the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah. Ch.</hi> 53. 5. We have Redemption, and forgiveneſs of Sins through his blood. This Love of his, is ſo ſuited to this want of the Soul, that it can be ſupplyed no other way. God forgiveth ſin and none but he: who but the creditor can diſcharge the debtor; but it is for Chriſts ſake that God forgiveth us, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 32. Without blood there is no remiſſion; this was tipyfyed (as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle teacheth us) by the Beaſts of old ſlain for Sacrifices of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation, and Atonement, and without <hi>his Blood</hi> we could have had no Remiſſion; for it is very vain (as the ſame Apoſtle inſtructs us) for any to think that the blood of <hi>Bulls</hi> and <hi>Lambs</hi> and <hi>Goats</hi> could de away Sin.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, <hi>The Soul wants Righteouſneſs.</hi> A righteouſneſs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it ſhould ſtand before God as if it had never ſinned againſt him. For the righteous Lord (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) loveth righteouſneſs, and the Apoſtle tells us <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>That God declareth his righteouſneſs for the remiſſion of Sins.</hi> Such is the nature, or at leaſt ſuch is the will, of God, that he remits no ſins, but upon a firſt declaration of his <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</hi> Neither doth God accept any Soul but the righteous Soul: we have no righteouſneſs, our works will not make this Web. God therefore imputeth <hi>Righteouſneſs without works. Rom.</hi> 4. 6. In the Goſpel God hath <hi>revealed his righteouſneſs from faithto Faith.</hi> Rom. 1. 17. This is the righteouſneſs of Chriſt. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3. <hi>For what the law could not do becauſe it was weak through our fleſh, that God himſelf hath done, ſending his Son in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh, and for ſin condemning ſin in the fleſh, That the righteouſneſs of the Law might be fulfilled in us.</hi> Hence Chriſt is by the Prophet called the <hi>Lord our Righteouſneſs,</hi> and the Apoſtle ſaith he was made of God for us <hi>wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, righteouſneſs;</hi> And hence the Apoſtle Prayeth. <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. 8, 9. <hi>That</hi> he might <hi>win Chriſt,</hi> which he expounds. <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>And be found in him, not having my own righteouſneſs which is of the Law, but that which is through the Faith of Chriſt, the righteouſneſs which is of God by faith.</hi> It is called the <hi>Righteouſneſs of God</hi> becauſe it is that which God accepteth us for; the <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> of Chriſt, becauſe it is his perfect Satisfaction to, and obedience to the law; and the <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of faith</hi> becauſe it is by <hi>faith,</hi> by us received, and applyed, and made ours. But in Chriſt and from Chriſt the Soul muſt find, and have that righteouſneſs in which alone it can ſtand before God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third great want of the Soul is <hi>Peace.</hi> Peace with God.
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:61084:87"/>
Peace with itſelf. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 7. The <hi>Carnalmind</hi> is <hi>Enmity to God.</hi> Take a man in his natural ſtate, he is an Enemy to God, and God is an Enemy to him. He hath no peace with God, and if he hath any quiet in his own mind, it is but a Truce not a Peace, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Gods ſilence, not the product of his favour. Now in Chriſt and in him alone the Soul hath peace. In the world (ſaith our Saviour to his diſciples) <hi>you ſhall have trouble, but in me you ſhall have pcace.</hi> My peace, ſaith he, I give unto you, I leave with you; It is he that hath reconciled the whole num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the elect to God by his death, and it is he who doth by his Spirit, and the word of reconciliation committed to his Miniſters act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually reconcile Souls unto himſelf. He is therefore called our <hi>Peace,</hi> we have <hi>Peace with God through him, Rom.</hi> 5. 1. And therefore the Apoſtle in all his Salutations prefixed to his Epiſtles prayeth, Mercy and <hi>Peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. A fourth great want of the Soul is <hi>Purity. No unclean</hi> thing ſhall enter into the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Take the Soul of a Chriſtian Naturally, it is an impure, filthy Soul; what can be clean that is born of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man? Or how can that which is clean come from that which is unclean? The connate proneneſs of our hearts to whatſoever is evil, and the natural averſion of our hearts to any thing that is good is a ſufficient proof of this. The promiſe of the clean heart, and of the new heart in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. (as you know) are both from God. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14. the Apoſtle tells, us <hi>That the blood of Chriſt purgeth our Conſciences from dead Works to ſerve the living God:</hi> Hence the Apoſtle. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. Telleth us, that Chriſt is made unto us Wiſdom, <hi>Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and Redemption.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The 5th great Want of the Soul which I mentioned was, <hi>Hopes</hi> or <hi>Aſſurance,</hi> of an <hi>happy Exiſtence</hi> to all eternity: This Want now accrueth from the Soul's <hi>Immortality.</hi> The Conſideration that God hath created us under an Ordination to an <hi>Eternal Exiſtence</hi> and <hi>State.</hi> Admitting this (which indeed is the main thing that diſtinguiſheth a reaſonab'e Soul from the Soul of a brute Creature) it is impoſſible that the Soul ſhould be under any degree of Happineſs, that hath not ſome <hi>Hopes</hi> or <hi>Aſſurance</hi> of <hi>Glory,</hi> That its Soul ſhall go to God when it leaveth the Body. And that the Body ſhall riſe again in a <hi>joyful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,</hi> in which it ſhall be again united to the Soul, that both may live with God for ever. Now this is a Good which floweth unto the Soul, from the <hi>Loves of Chriſt:</hi> This needs no further
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:61084:87" rendition="simple:additions"/>
proof than: 1. That no Soul is born to this glorious, and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible Inheritance, for we are by <hi>nature Children of Wrath,</hi> and <hi>eternal life is the Gift of God,</hi> (as the Apoſtle tells us) Rom. 6. <hi>The Gift of God is eternal Life,</hi> and it is a gift which cometh from God to us by the Hands of Chriſt. John 17. 2. <hi>As thou haſt given him Power over all Fleſh that he ſhould give eternal Life to as many as thou haſt given him:</hi> And <hi>John</hi> 10. 28. Speaking of his ſheep (ſaith he) I <hi>give unto them eternal Life, and they ſhall never periſh.</hi> Now as their having a certain right to, and their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture poſſeſſion of eternal Life, is neceſſary for them in another Life, when this tranſitory Life ſhall be determined; ſo the hopes, or full aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of it is neceſſary for them, to make them in any meaſures happy while they live here. And this is in, and from, Chriſt alſo and therefore he is called <hi>our Hope,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 1. And the the Apoſtle, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 27. ſaith, <hi>Chriſt in us is the Hopes of Glory:</hi> That is, all the Hopes we have of Glory are from Chriſt. This is abundantly enough to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince that poſitive goodneſs that is in the <hi>Loves of Chriſt,</hi> their high and ſutable conveniencies to the neceſſities and wants of our Souls. I ſhall in the next place ſhew you the tranſcendent Goodneſs and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency that is in them, that they are, as the Text ſaith, <hi>Better then Wine,</hi> or as it is expreſſed in the <hi>Hebrew Idiome, good before Wine. Wine,</hi> as I have before ſhewed you, literally Signifies the Juice of the Grape. <hi>Figuratively</hi> whatſoever is good, ſweet and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in the World. Now take it in one or both Senſes, The Demonſtration is very eaſy. I ſhall make it in 3 particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt all <hi>the Goodneſs that is in Wine,</hi> (taken either <hi>litterally</hi> for the Juice of the Grape, or <hi>Figuratively</hi> for all created comforts) <hi>lies in a Sutableneſs of them,</hi> (and that but for a time neither) to the more <hi>external wants of a Creature.</hi> Three things muſt be yielded con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning all created <hi>Goods.</hi> 1. <hi>None of them reach the wants of the Soul, which is the beſt and nobleſt part of man.</hi> What do <hi>Pleaſures, Riches, Honours,</hi> whatſoever this world affordeth, ſignify as to the Souls wants? It wants <hi>Pardon of ſins;</hi> Will any of theſe procure or purchaſe it? It wants a <hi>Righteouſneſs wherein to ſtand before God;</hi> Will theſe procure it? It wants <hi>Peace of Conſcience,</hi> Will thoſe give it? It wants <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> Will they cleanſe it? It naturally wants a <hi>Right and title to Glory,</hi> and the <hi>Hopes or Aſſurance of it;</hi> Can any of theſe help the Soul to it? They indeed ſute the more external wants of Man. The wanton Senſe wants grateful Objects, They will Supply it; The body wants Food, and Rayment, they will Supply it; But
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:61084:88" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for the more inward Spiritual Wants of the Soul, they have no Suta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs to them, no conveniency. But (as I have ſhewed you) the Loves of Chriſt have, nay, they are not onely ſuted to the Souls greateſt wants but to the Bodies alſo, at leaſt ſo far as the Soul hath influence on the Body, upon the Happineſs of which it undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath; for a <hi>good Conſcience is a continual feaſt:</hi> The Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which Grace filleth the Soul with, the Mortification, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing of the Paſſions, and ſtubborn Will of Man, have a great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection upon the Health and chearfulneſs of the Body. So that here is a double Argument to prove the Loves of Chriſt better than Wine. 1. <hi>From their Sutableneſs to the neceſſities and wants of the Soul, which</hi> are the wants of the nobleſt part of man. 2. <hi>From their ſutableneſs to the wants both of Soul and body,</hi> by reaſon of the Reflection which the Souls good hath upon the outward Man, even in this Life, to ſay nothing of the joyful Reſurrection of the Body, and the Happineſs both of Body, and Soul, reunited in the Enjoyment of God for ever. 2. <hi>All created Comforts laſt but for a Seaſon,</hi> and that a <hi>little Seaſon.</hi> They only ſute the wants of our Bodies in this Life. <hi>Riches profit not in the day of Wrath:</hi> Honours lie down with our Bodies in the duſt, Pleaſures ceaſe, when our ſenſes which they gratified are gone: Nay very often the Sutableneſs or gratefulneſs of theſe created Goods extinguiſheth before the determination of our natural Lives. When <hi>Barzillai</hi> was Foureſcore years old his Eye took no pleaſure in ſeeing, nor his Ear in hearing. There are daies in this Life, Eccleſ. 12. 7. <hi>in which a man ſhall ſay he hath no pleaſure in them?</hi> What do <hi>Riches,</hi> Honours, Friends, Pleaſures, ſignify in a day of Sickneſs? 3. <hi>No created good</hi> ſuteth all our wants, one ſuteth one want, another fills up another Emptineſs, none ſuteth all: But the Love of Chriſt as it ſuteth our Soul wants, So it is Suted to all times, and is certain, and a Supply to all wants of Souls. This is my firſt Argument to prove his Loves better then Wine.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2. Secondly</hi> there is no need or want, which Wine, or created goods ſupplieth but the Love of Chriſt will ſupply, and much more eminently, and abundantly: <hi>Let me open this in a few particulars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Wine in regard of the Subtile, Spirituous nature of it, hath a great vertue to exhilarate the Spirits and to raiſe up the Affection of Joy.</hi> Hence you read of thoſe <hi>who ſhout by reaſon of Wine. Pſal.</hi> 78. 65. And the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>VVine makes glad the heart of Man.</hi> Pſal. 104. 15. and <hi>Ecc.</hi> 10. 19. <hi>Wine maketh merry.</hi> But do not the Loves of Chriſt do this much more? <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 19. <hi>And be you not</hi>
                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:61084:88"/>
                  <hi>drunk with Wine, wherein is Exceſs, but be you filled with the Spirit, ſpeaking to your ſelves in Pſalms and Hymns and Spiritual Songs, making Melody in your heart to the Lord. David,</hi> Pſal. 4. cries out, <hi>Lord lift thou up the light of thy Countenance upon me, for thou thereby ſhalt make my heart more glad then theirs, when their Corn, and Wine, and Oil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth.</hi> Thoſe who are critical in words in the Latine Tongue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh between <hi>Voluptas</hi> and <hi>Gaudium.</hi> Pleaſure they make to be nothing but the Senſual Appetites Satisfaction, 'tis common to Beaſts as well as Man. <hi>Gaudium</hi> or Joy they make to be the procede of the ſatisfaction of the <hi>rational Appetite;</hi> the firſt is meerly ſenſual, and beaſtly, the latter alone becometh a Man who is a reaſonable Creature. I am ſure that <hi>Mirth</hi> which is in the Soul of man, that Exhilaration of his Spirits, which ariſeth from the ſenſe and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the Love of Chriſt unto the ſoul, is a Satisfaction to the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, Spiritual Appetite; ſo the nature of it muſt be more Spiritual, more Suted to the reaſonable creature, then any Wine, or indeed any created comforts can be.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Wine is of excellent uſe to allay our thirſt,</hi> and in <hi>Phyſick and Chirugery</hi> under <hi>deliquiums,</hi> &amp;c. This is a great execellency that is in it. <hi>Prov.</hi> 31. 6. <hi>Give wine to thoſe of heavy hearts.</hi> In Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgery it is of uſe to <hi>waſh and cleanſe wounds,</hi> &amp;c. Hence you read in the Goſpel, of the good <hi>Samaritane</hi> that he put <hi>Wine</hi> and <hi>Oil</hi> into the wounds of the man that was fallen amongſt thieves. But in this reſpect are not the loves of Chriſt good before Wine? Wine onely ſatisfieth the cravings of nature, the drought of the body for want of moiſture. If a Soul <hi>hungers and thirſteth after righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> Wine will not allay that thirſt, the Loves of Chriſt will; and ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the thirſtings of a Soul are far greater wants than the want of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor for the body. Wine may be of ſome uſe in <hi>Deliquiums</hi> and failures of the Vital, and Animal Spirits. But if the Soul <hi>fainteth</hi> for <hi>Gods Salvation,</hi> Wine is of no uſe, the Loves of Chriſt are. Wine may waſh and purify the wounds of the body and keep them from putrefaction, but the Loves of Chriſt alone can puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the wounds of a Soul and reſiſt putrefaction there. <hi>He was annointed to preach glad tidings to the meek, to bind up the broken hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to appoint to them that mourn in Sion, Beauty for Aſhes, and the Oil of gladneſs for the Spirit of heavineſs.</hi> Iſaiah 61. 1, 2, 3.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Wine will make a man forget his affliction. Prov.</hi> 31. 6, 7. <hi>Give wine to him who is of a heavy heart, let him drink and forget his poverty, and remember his miſery no more;</hi> but now wine doth this by
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:61084:89"/>
bringing a man unto a kind of ſtupefaction or temporary deliration, and the Affliction, muſt be meerly external, and not in extremity. Wine makes a Man forget his affliction onely by putting him beſides himſelf. The Loves of Chriſt have a proportionable effect upon the Soul, but of a far more high and excellent nature. Let a Soul be bowed down to Hell and not know what to do, Let but the <hi>Loves</hi> of Chriſt ſhine upon it in the ſealing of any promiſe, it forgets all its poverty, and miſery. The Soul will rejoyce in <hi>Sufferings, glory in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation,</hi> &amp;c. the <hi>Martyr</hi> cries out that the fire is but as a <hi>Bed of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi> So that you ſee there is never a good quality in Wine but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing proportionable to it, (only infinitely excelling) is to be found in Chriſts loves.</p>
               <p>My laſt demonſtration of the truth of this Propoſition is this. <hi>Wine</hi> though it hath many excellent qualities, yet hath it alſo ſome <hi>ill qualities;</hi> The <hi>Loves of Chriſt</hi> are not ſuch. There is an <hi>exceſs in Wine</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 18, 19. <hi>Be not drunk with Wine wherein is exceſs.</hi> It is a <hi>mocker</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon)</hi> it will <hi>intoxicate,</hi> breed many diſeaſes, many a one periſheth by drinking too much Wine. But no Soul ever periſhed from the exceſs of Chriſts love to it, no Soul ever contracted any diſtemper from it, <hi>he you filled with the Spirit,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle in the ſame Text, where he tells us there is an <hi>exceſs in Wine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Much of what I have ſaid concerning the excellency of the love of Chriſt above <hi>Wine,</hi> taken in a literal ſenſe, is as true concerning it, in its figurative ſenſe, as it may be ſuppoſed and interpreted to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify and created comforts, they only are ſuited to our <hi>External wants</hi> only, they are but <hi>temporary</hi> and <hi>uncertain,</hi> they alſo have ſome <hi>ill qualities</hi> attending them.

                  <note place="margin">Uſe 1.</note> By way of application. We may in the firſt place obſerve <hi>in o what a degree of debauchery the generality of the Sons and Daughters are fallen.</hi> Nothing more becomes a Man or Woman conſidered as a reaſonable Creature, than to diſcern aright betwixt things that differ, and to judge aright concerning them, and accordingly to make our <hi>Election,</hi> and to guide our practice. But ſuppoſing what you have heard to be truth, where is the man of many, that right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcerneth, rightly judgeth, or aright guideth himſelf in practice? where is the man that judgeth the loves of Chriſt better than Wine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How many are there that judge Wine better then the loves of Chriſt.</hi> Wine, not in the figurative ſenſe, as it ſignifies all outward, created comforts, but in the literal ſenſe, as it ſignifieth nothing but the <hi>juice</hi>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:61084:89"/>
                  <hi>of the Grape,</hi> fermented and a little refined from its dregs, doth not every one thus judge, <hi>that uſeth Wine immoderately?</hi> that ſits bibbing at a Tavern until the Wine inflameth him, Chriſt by his Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> hath ſaid, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 18, 19. <hi>Be not drunk with Wine wherein is exceſs.</hi> How many are there, that <hi>tarry long at the Wine, that go to ſeek mixt Wine, that look upon wine when it is red, when it giveth its colour in the cup, when it moveth itſelf aright,</hi> till at laſt <hi>it biteth like a Serpent, and ſtingeth like an Adder,</hi> till it cauſeth <hi>woe, and ſorrow, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, and wounds, and redneſs of the Eyes</hi> (as <hi>Solomon</hi> Speaketh, Prov. 23, 29, 30, 31.) and yet have no ſenſe of the Loves of Chriſt, no thoughts of it, make no enquiries after it, take no courſe for the obtaining it. Do not thoſe poor wretches Love wine better than the <hi>Love of Chriſt,</hi> that will not abate life a cup of wine to gain it? Thoſe that for an intemperate cup of wine, will be diſobedient to the rule which Chriſt hath given them. My Soul in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, even akes to think what will become of drunkards, by whom I mean not thoſe only who reel in the ſtreets and are intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated with Wine, but thoſe who take a greater pleaſure in drinking than in praying or hearing the word of God or obeying his will.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But if we extend the notion of wine further, to ſignify all ſenſual Satisfactions, all created comforts, Lord how many are there in the world that in this betray their folly, and diſcover the corruption, and debauchery of humane nature. How few are there in the world that do not prefer ſome creature or other before the loves of Chriſt; indeed as the Poet-ſaith—<hi>Trahit ſua quemque voluptas;</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one is not alike taken with every ſenſual object, the Apoſtle tells us we have <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

Separate from mankind, <hi>drunkards, laſcivious perſons, vain perſons,</hi> perſons that are <hi>covetous,</hi> and too greedy of the worlds riches, <hi>ambitious men,</hi> whoſe God is honour and applauſe, credit and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in the World, how few will you leave? But I hear ſome ſay this is an hard cenſure upon mankind, men indeed are fleſh, and blood, man hath natural Senſes and naturally ſeeks the gratification, and Satisfaction of them, but we hope we do not prefer the ſatisfaction of them before the <hi>Loves of Chriſt</hi> ſhewed in the <hi>pardon of ſin, peace of conſcience, purity of heart, the hopes of glory.</hi> This were a very ſad thing, and it is a very hard judgment to paſs upon any Soul; we muſt
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:61084:90"/>
plead not guilty to this Indictment. Say you ſo? my next queſtion is how will ye be tryed? will you be tryed by the ordinary rules of tryals of your preference in other caſes: anſwer me then, or call your ſouls to anſwer themſelves in ſome few queſtions: What do you moſt delight to hear of? what do you pleaſe your ſelves moſt in? what do you imploy your ſelves moſt in the purſuit of? what do you moſt <hi>poſtpone,</hi> and put behind in the motions of your lives? which do you moſt neglect for the other? &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>What do you moſt delight to hear of?</hi> The loves of Chriſt are not the objects of any ſenſe but the <hi>Ear,</hi> but they may be heard of. Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons ſhould be principally ſuch diſcourſes; diſcourſes of Chriſts love; <hi>we preach Chriſt Crucified,</hi> canſt thou be patient to hear diſcourſes of the loves of Women, diſcourſes of worldly buſineſſes of vanity, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hours, and canſt thou not with the like patience and delight ſit out a Sermon of one hour? art thou never ſaying, when will this vain, idle, diſcourſe be done, this diſcourſe that tends nothing to the good of my Soul, and yet often ſaying when will this Sermon be done? Judge then whether thy Soul judgeth the loves of Chriſt bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than Wine? There are thoſe that <hi>can riſe up early in the morning,</hi> that they may follow ſtrong drink, and continue till night, till Wine inflame them, and canſt not thou riſe up early to hear of the <hi>love of Chriſt,</hi> and ſit an <hi>hour or two,</hi> till the report of his love inflameth thy Soul. Hadſt thou rather hear a wanton idle ſtory, than a Goſpel ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? how doſt thou then prefer the loves of Chriſt before Wine; thou manifeſtly giveſt the preference to a ſenſual ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>What do you moſt pleaſe your thoughts in the contemplation &amp; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation of?</hi> My meditation of him (ſaith <hi>David)</hi> ſhall be ſweet. Our thoughts muſt feed themſelves with ſome objects; we are ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed with the ſtraits and neceſſities of this life, with the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diverſions, and temptations, that I think it unreaſonable to put the tryal there. <hi>Whether have the loves of Chriſt, or worldly objects moſt of your thoughts,</hi> none would acquit themſelves upon ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry. But <hi>which are your Souls moſt pleaſant Bread,</hi> which are your <hi>ſweeteſt meditations?</hi> this will try a Soul; undoubtedly ſuch objects as a Soul moſt preferreth, it will be moſt pleaſed in the contemplation of. But is this the caſe of the moſt of men? can they ſay, that though they have more thoughts upon the World, and ſenſible objects in it, yet the meditations upon the World, and the other are rather thoughts of neceſſity, than of delight and pleaſure?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>What do you moſt imploy your ſelves in the purſuit of? Is</hi>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:61084:90"/>
                  <hi>it ſenſible ſatisfactions, or Chriſts love,</hi> I do not here mean by <hi>[moſt] a frequency of action, or length of time,</hi> but a warmth, and fervency, and intenſion of affection, and a Chriſtians circumſtances, and ſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the world may be ſuch as will inforce him to ſpend more of his time, and more of his action about worldly than about ſpiritual things, but which doth the Soul preſs moſt hard after? which purſuit hath moſt of the ſtrength and vigour of the inward man? That doubtleſs hath the preference in the mans judgment: it is an ill ſign to ſee a man work hard, and pray coldly, lazily, perfunctorily, when men ſpend their ſtrength for that which is not bread, when a man ſo toileth in his pleaſures, when he preſſeth ſo hard after the World, that his whole heart may be diſcerned and read in thoſe purſuits, and but half his heart can be diſcerned in his purſuits after the loves of Chriſt, he comes late to an Ordinance of God, he ſleeps, when he is there, he doth the work of his <hi>God negligently.</hi> My Soul (ſaith <hi>David</hi> preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth <hi>hard after thee;</hi> it is an excellent ſign, when tho the motions of the Soul be after the World, yet the <hi>preſſings</hi> hard of <hi>the Soul</hi> are after Chriſt, and his loves.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>In the motions of your lives, what do you moſt</hi> poſtpone <hi>and put be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind?</hi> that which is moſt poſtponed, is leaſt preferred, <hi>Let my Tongue</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> Pſal. 137. 6.) <hi>cleave to the roof of my mouth, if I prefer not</hi> Hieruſalem <hi>before my chief Joy.</hi> We have an Engliſh ſaying, <hi>That meat and drink may be had, but work may ſtay:</hi> it intimates our preference of meat and drink before <hi>labour,</hi> the end of which is chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to procure meat and drink. Do you ſay I muſt pray, I and my Houſe muſt ſeek the Lord, I muſt hear that my Soul live, my labour in my calling, that may ſtay? It is a very ill ſign, that the Soul pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers earthly things before heavenly things, when he poſtpones the means to obtain things heavenly, to the means for obtaining things that are earthly, when every trifling buſineſs, will turn him off from prayer, reading, hearing the Word. It is true, there is a time for all things. But when the Worlds time is admitted to joſtle out Gods time, and Gods time is not reſerved to him, and the worlds time ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yields to Gods time, it is a very ill ſign that <hi>Chriſts loves</hi> have not the preference in the Soul.</p>
               <p>Laſtly. <hi>Which do you moſt neglect for the other?</hi> Our Saviour tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 24. <hi>No man can ſerve two Maſters, for either he will love the one, and hate the other, or elſe he will hold to the one, and deſpiſe the other,</hi> the neglect of one thing to give place, or room to another, ſufficiently argueth the <hi>preference</hi> of that for which we
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:61084:91"/>
make room, before that, by the neglect of which we make room for it. Do you neglect the world and the things of the world, to give room for the loves of Chriſt, and the means to obtain them, or do you neglect the loves of Chriſt, and the means he hath appointed for the gaining of them for the world, and the means you are to uſe for the gaining of it? But I have I fear ſaid enough not only to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you that the moſt men and women in the world are guilty of a <hi>falſe judgment,</hi> either judging Wine in the literal ſenſe, or at leaſt in the figurative ſenſe, better than Chriſts love, but alſo to convince Gods own People that they do not ſufficiently live up to, and practice what they profeſs to Believe. I might add another thing.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Whoſoever purchaſeth Wine or a ſatisfaction from any creature by a diſobedience to the commands of Chriſt, doth moſt certainly judge, that Wine, that creature, better then Chriſts loves.</hi> The demonſtration of this depends upon this, That no man or woman can truly ſay they love Chriſt, or groundedly expect that Chriſt ſhould love them, that doth not keep his Commandments, or that wilfully, ordinarily, and preſumptuouſly breaketh them, tho there none lives who doth not, ſin againſt God.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Uſe 2.</note> I ſhall ſhut up this diſcourſe with a word of exhortation, which muſt be <hi>to a preference of the loves of Chriſt before Wine.</hi> I ſhall preſs this exhortation upon you by ſome arguments.</p>
               <p>My firſt argument ſhall be drawn <hi>from the reaſonableneſs of this; That a reaſonable Soul ſhould judge of things not according to any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances from falſe repreſentations, but as they are.</hi> I have ſpoken e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to perſuade any perſon, that believeth that he is not a meer lump of fleſh, but hath a reaſonable Soul, and that he is not a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this life meerly, but ordained to an Eternal Exiſtence, and that the Soul of every man by nature, and his ſtate is ſuch as the holy Scriptures ſpeak it to be, that the loves of Chriſt are more ſuited to his neceſſities, &amp; his true, &amp; real wants, than it is poſſible that any created comforts ſhould be; now admitting this, what more doth become area<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable creature than to judge them ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> All other judgment is but fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy, and deceit, and of all deceit, and fallacy, there's nothing ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of a man as to cheat and deceive himſelf. Thus every Soul doth that judgeth any thing better than the <hi>Loves of Chriſt.</hi> Further yet there is nothing more unworthy of a man then to outlaw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſuffer his paſſion to domineer over his reaſon; the courſe of mans Soul according to reaſon is for his will to follow the <hi>dictate of his underſtanding,</hi> for him to purſue the things, which he judgeth
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:61084:91"/>
moſt excellent; and though in other things indeed man doth not ſo' he ſeeth that which is better and doth that which he confeſſeth and judgeth worſt, yet all this is paſſion, and ſo far as a man walketh or acteth thus, he acteth not reaſonably, but this is but the firſt argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and conſidereth them meerly as men.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond ſhall concern you <hi>as Creatures. What an indignity do you put upon the Creator to prefer the Creature before him:</hi> Wine is but a Creature, Riches, Honours, the World and all that is therein it is all but a Creature. Chriſt is God over all bleſſed for ever. It is a mighty degradation of God in our hearts to prefer any thing to his loves. How can any man think that God ſhould look upon that Soul that dethroneth him, and preferreth ſome of his creatures, yea of the meaneſt of his Creatures in his affections before him, how righteouſly ſhall God leave that Soul to the creature as its portion, that chuſeth it, and chuſeth it in preference to his loves.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Conſider what an ill requital this is of Chriſts love to you?</hi> This argument now concerneth you as you are <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Chriſt in the fulneſs of time left his <hi>Fathers Throne,</hi> and took not upon him the nature of Angels, but the nature of Man. Chriſt in his love, his redeeming love to you hath manifeſted a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble preference. 1. <hi>A preference of your good to his own glory and manifeſtative favour from God his Father.</hi> Chriſt indeed in his eſtate of humiliation, was the beloved Son of his Father, his Father in that time proclaimed him his only begotten Son in whom he was well pleaſed. But he had not thoſe manifeſtations of that love as before he was incarnate. He was made a <hi>curſe</hi> for us that the bleſſing of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> might come down upon us, he cryed out upon the Croſs, <hi>my God! my God! why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> 2. <hi>A preference of you to Angels.</hi> He took not upon him the nature of Angels, but your na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, now how ill do you requite this love of your Saviour in prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a creature to it; how can we believe the Goſpel, and all that it telleth us of the dying loves of Chriſt, and do this? Oh therefore let not this be the condemnation of any poor Soul that heareth me this day, let none of us incur the guilt of this Idolatry. God aggravateth the Peoples ſin of Idolatry from this, that they ſaid to a <hi>ſtack</hi> and to a <hi>ſtone thou art our Father;</hi> the more baſe and low and unworthy the object is that is preferred before another, the greater is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of the preference. Let us then ſo live, ſo walk as by our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation to evidence to the world, that the <hi>Loves of Chriſt</hi> to our Souls are better than all the Wine which the world can afford us. Let
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:61084:92"/>
us not break a divine Precept to embrace any thing which this World can afford us, in this we ſhall be ſo far from acting like to Chriſtians, or Creatures, that we ſhall not act like men poſſeſſed of reaſonable Souls. Let us in our hearts more thirſt, in the Spirit after Chriſts Love, than the worlds imbraces, let us delight more in any reports of the love of Chriſt, any diſcourſes concerning it, than in any world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly objects. Let us be more diligent in uſe of means to gain Chriſts love, than to gain the whole world. Let us be more ſatisfied in the enjoyment of any thing of it, than if we enjoyed all the World can afford us. I remember <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>The bleſſing of God maketh rich; and addeth no ſorrow therewith.</hi> The Loves of Chriſt make the Soul happy, and mixeth no ſorrow with that happineſs. Wine is a ſweet liquor, but it will intoxicate, in time it will grow flat, and acid, and there is no created good, but will at one time or other grow flat, &amp; ſharp, if the Soul be not drunk with it. There is a ſatiety in pleaſure, riches, honour, there is a time when there will be no pleaſure in them, when we ſhall be able to ſee no goodneſs at all in them. Let us neglect them upon the proſpect of the vanity of them, and the vexation of Spirit that is in them before we come to experience their <hi>vanity and rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> I have ſhewed you a far more excellent object.—<hi>Chriſts loves are better than Wine.</hi>

               <p>I ſhall lay the proof of this Doctrine upon theſe 2 Propoſitions, which have a natural rational evidence to every reaſonable Soul.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Soul of man naturally, and neceſſarily knowing an object to be good, and wanting it in whole or in part to any conſiderable degree, doth deſire it, and without ſuch knowledge it deſires it not.</hi> It is a rule in <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> we will nothing, but what to us appeareth good, It is our miſery in our lapſed ſtate, that many things to us appear ſo, which are not ſo, but they muſt ſo appear or we cannot will them. Three things muſt concur to make any thing the object of a reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Souls deſires. 1. <hi>An apprehended goodneſs in it.</hi> That is, an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended Sutableneſs in it, to our ſtate, or circumſtances, if there be never ſo much <hi>goodneſs</hi> in a thing if we have no knowledge of it, no apprehenſion of ſuch goodneſs in it, our will moveth not by deſire toward it. Hence it is, that the <hi>Clown</hi> deſires no <hi>learning,</hi> and the man of <hi>learning and knowledge</hi> deſireth no <hi>exceſs of gold or Silver.</hi> Though there be a goodneſs in <hi>learning and knowledge.</hi> Yet the Clown apprehends it not, ſo doth not deſire it, and though there be ſome degrees of goodneſs in a great eſtate, yet the <hi>Philoſopher</hi> and man of <hi>contemplation</hi> apprehends it no further than as it ſerveth for a <hi>Via<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticum,</hi> a Travelling Penny to pay for food &amp; rayment whiles he paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth through the world. And indeed this is the true reaſon why the ſenſual profane man ſaith to the <hi>Almighty, depart from me,</hi> and to Chriſt, what do I care for thee? for being under no conviction of his loſt, and miſerable eſtate, and poſſibly hardly believing that he hath an immortal Soul, or ſhall have any exiſtence beyond this Life, he ſeeth nothing in Chriſt, or the loves of Chriſt, that any way ſuteth the neceſſities, and wants of his Soul, and, <hi>Ignot i nulla cupido,</hi> what good a man doth not know he never longeth for. 2. A Second thing, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring to make the Object of deſire is an <hi>apprehended poſſibility</hi> of <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining</hi>

                  <hi>to or enjoying what he apprehends ſo ſutable;</hi> for the reaſon of man will not ſuffer his Soul to move towards what he apprehends <hi>impoſſible to be attained.</hi> Hence as no <hi>Schollar</hi> ever heartily deſired all kinds &amp; degrees of learning &amp; knowledge: ſo no worldling ever deſired all the <hi>Gold and Silver</hi> in it. Hence it is alſo impoſſible that a Soul under an <hi>habituated deſpair</hi> ſhould heartily deſire the Love, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God, which it apprehends not poſſible for it to obtain. 3. The <hi>object of it muſt be ſomthing which the Soul wanteth, either in whole, or in part, either as to the thing it ſelf, or as to ſome degrees of it, or at leaſt what it apprehendeth itſelf to want?</hi> Still apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is neceſſary, for <hi>De non Entibus, &amp; non apparentibus, eadem eſt ratio.</hi> It is the ſame thing as to this motion of the Soul not to have a good, and not to apprehend that it hath it. for our Souls move according to their apprehenſions; and this is the reaſon, none deſires <hi>being</hi> (though they may deſire the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of it;) the <hi>healthy man</hi> deſireth not health (though he may bleſs God for it and deſireth the continuance of it.) The Ignorant bold preſumptuous Sinner deſireth not the Love of God, the pardon of Sins; he thinks he is ſure of all. Hence now it is that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever <hi>deſires the Loves of Chriſt,</hi> it apprehendeth them <hi>good, poſſible,</hi> and what <hi>its Soul</hi> doth <hi>ſtand indaily, and further need of,</hi> which <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion</hi> is the reaſon why our Souls deſire any thing, be it of what nature ſoever; we can deſire nothing but what we muſt apprehend <hi>good,</hi> ſutable to us in ſome of our circumſtances, poſſible to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and ſuch as either wholly, or in ſome degree at leaſt, we need.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>According to the degree of our knowledge or apprehenſion of the goodneſs of any object ſo are our deſires after it.</hi> This will juſtify itſelf upon experience in all other things, we do not deſire them according to the degree of goodneſs in them, for then every man muſt deſire the favour of God, Union and Communion with him, but according to the <hi>degree of our knowledge, or apprehenſion</hi> of ſuch a <hi>good,</hi> as ſuch. Now there are various degrees of knowledge.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt and meaneſt is the <hi>meer act of our Underſtanding.</hi> which by the help of our <hi>Eyes,</hi> and <hi>Ears</hi> gaineth the knowledge of things, And thus the vileſt of men may know that the Loves of Chriſt are good, yea good before wine, that is, they may have ſo read in the Bible, ſo heard from Miniſters of the Goſpel. And even this knowledge may produce in a bad man a deſire after theſe things, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned to his apprehenſion. Hence ſuch a man may faintly will, and lazily deſire theſe things.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:61084:94"/>
2. A Second degree of Knowledge is <hi>Opinion.</hi> This riſeth a little higher, the man who thus knows that the <hi>Loves of Chriſt are</hi> good, doth not onely know it from reading, or hearing, but from <hi>probable Arguments.</hi> Nor is it difficult for a wicked man thus alſo to know that the <hi>Loves of Chriſt are good.</hi> Aſſoon as he can be made to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that there is a God, and that he is the Fountain of Good, and that Jeſus Chriſt is the Eternal Son of God, and Equal with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, both in Eſſence and all Divine Perfections, his Reaſon will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade him that there muſt be a Goodneſs, yea, a tranſcendent Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in <hi>Chriſts Loves.</hi> But while Fleſh and Blood only revealeth this thing unto him, his Knowledge is incertain and faint, and he is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to thoughts that he may be miſtaken, and therefore though he may ſometimes deſire Chriſts Love, yet it is but by fits, and with incertainties, according to the Nature of the Knowledge and Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion he hath of the truth of the things.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A Third degree of <hi>Knowledge</hi> is <hi>Perſuaſion,</hi> ariſing from <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration.</hi> Now there is 1. A <hi>Demonſtration of Senſe;</hi> thus we know the Sun ſhines, the Fire burneth, &amp;c. 2. A <hi>Demonſtration of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;</hi> when we can conclude a thing from infallible Principles of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Reaſon. 3. A <hi>Demonſtration of Faith,</hi> which is the <hi>Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Spirit.</hi> When men know things from the <hi>holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi> fully perſuading them of the truth of this, or that, from a <hi>Divine Revelation.</hi> This is the <hi>Demonſtration of faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. There is yet a further and higher degree of <hi>Knowledg,</hi> that ariſeth from <hi>Experience,</hi> being a <hi>ſenſible Evidence</hi> of the truth of what the Soul had before received a little of, from the <hi>ſight of the Eye and hearing</hi> of the <hi>Ear,</hi> and more from the perſuaſion of the Spirit, and ſome Argumentations within itſelf. I ſay now that according to the degree of the Souls knowledge and apprehenſion, ſo are the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Affections: This of deſire in particular. Hence the deſires of Believers to the <hi>Loves of Chriſt,</hi> muſt neceſſarily be the ſtrongeſt: For the degree of the <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Apprehenſion</hi> the Believer hath of the goodneſs of them, is higher than it is poſſible any other Souls ſhould have. Other Souls may have read Books diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing the Loves of Chriſt, or heard Diſcourſes of that tendency, or judge ſo from Arguments of Scripture, which may make ſuch a thing probable to them: But none but theſe have any perſuaſion wrought in their Souls by the Spirit of God, of the Excellency of them, none elſe have had any real Taſts and Experience of them <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Experience</hi> of the Goodneſs of any Objects being thoſe things which move the Soul to deſire them, and the degree of
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:61084:94"/>
the Souls apprehenſion of ſuch Goodneſs and Excellency in Objects, the ground of the Souls Intention in ſuch deſires; it muſt neceſſarily follow that a good Chriſtians <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Experience</hi> of that Goodneſs which is in <hi>Chriſts Loves,</hi> muſt be the grounds of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires after them. There needeth no Scripture to prove this, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to our Reaſon. Yet take the Inſtance of <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 4. 6. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> deſires of God <hi>to lift up the light of his Countenance upon him.</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve now <hi>v.</hi> 7. what made him prefer <hi>the light of Gods Countenance to the Worldlings Corn, and Wine, and Oil, Thou haſt put gladneſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my Heart.</hi> Accordingly he tells us <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9. 10. <hi>They that know thy Name will put their truſt in thee.</hi> Hence you ſhall obſerve that <hi>David</hi> concludeth many of his Pſalms of Praiſe with Prayer. But, will ſome ſay, <hi>If they have had experience of the Loves of Chriſt, why ſhould they yet deſire them? None deſires what they have.</hi> This is true, if our Enjoyments were perfect, but there is an <hi>heighth, and depth, and length, and breadth of the Love of God in Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> an <hi>heighth</hi> which the Soul hath not taken, a <hi>depth</hi> which the Soul hath not fathomed, a <hi>length</hi> and <hi>breadth</hi> which the Soul hath not meaſured from end to end. It is true, we deſire nothing but what we want, either in whole or in part, therefore in Heaven will be no <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, That which is perfect will be come, and all that</hi> which is <hi>in part only, will be done away:</hi> But we ſhall never be filled with the Loves of Chriſt till our Mortality be ſwallowed up in Life. I come now to the Application.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Uſe 1.</note> We may learn from hence. <hi>That God muſt ſhew ſome act of Love to us, before we can ſhew any Love to him.</hi> Deſires after the Loves of Chriſt, though ſincere, are the leaſt, and firſt, and loweſt moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our Souls toward God. Theſe (you have heard) muſt ariſe from a <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Experience</hi> of the <hi>goodneſs of thoſe Loves.</hi> Now this <hi>Knowledge,</hi> this <hi>Experience,</hi> muſt be the Gift of God to, and the work of God in, and upon the Soul, yea, and that not in a way of <hi>common Grace</hi> and <hi>Illumination,</hi> but in a way of <hi>ſpecial Grace;</hi> for though a <hi>common Illumination</hi> may produce ſome faint deſires, yet it will produce no ſincere and effectual deſires, becauſe the <hi>Knowledge,</hi> begot by them, will be flitting and incertain, and attended with Doubts, Fears, and Incertainties. So as till the Lord by his Spirit hath wrought in the Soul a perſuaſion of Faith, commanding the Soul without diſpute to give credit to what he hath revealed in his Word, there will be no ſincere deſires in the Soul after theſe things. The Schoolmen tell us there are three ways by which we gain the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:61084:95"/>
Knowledge of a thing. By <hi>Signs, Conjectures,</hi> and <hi>Effects,</hi> (as ſome Cauſes are known.) 2. By <hi>the enquiry of our Reaſon into the nature of it.</hi> 3. By <hi>Divine Revelation.</hi> The <hi>Excellency of the Loves of Chriſt</hi> is a ſpiritual thing, and to be judged upon Spiritual accounts, and in a Spiritual manner. <hi>The natural Man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 14. So as the natural Reaſon of a Man will ſerve him very little to the gaining of this Knowledge, by the <hi>Effects,</hi> having never experienced it he cannot know it; ſo as there is no other way to know it but by <hi>Divine Revelation, God</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 10.) <hi>hath revealed them to us by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> And <hi>v.</hi> 12. <hi>We have received the Spirit which is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given us of God.</hi> So as that I ſay God muſt ſhew ſome ſpecial token of his Love to our Souls for good, before we can ſhew any Love to him, or make ſo much as one ſtep toward him.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Uſe 2.</note> Obſerve from hence, <hi>That a Believers Soul moves rationally and accountably enough in all its deſires after the Loves of Chriſt.</hi> The Souls of Believers are not ſo unintelligible as ſome prophane Perſons would make them in their Paſſions for, and Motions towards Chriſts Loves. The <hi>Knowledge</hi> a Soul hath, or the Experience which it hath had of the Goodneſs and Excellency of any Object, moves the reaſonable Soul to the deſires of it. Admitting the Believer to ſee things in another Light than a natural Man hath, or can ſee in, to have other Notions of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil,</hi> and to take the meaſures of them from their ſubſerviency to the Spiritual and eternal good of the Soul; the Paſſions and Deſires of his Soul after Chriſts Love, are as natural Motions of the reaſonable Souls, as the Worldlings De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires after Riches, or the ſenſual Mans Paſſions for ſuch things as gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the ſenſitive Appetite. The Reaſon why every Soul moveth not after theſe Spiritual Things, is becauſe every Soul ſeeth not the Good and Excellency in them. Multitudes hardly know (that is, believe) they have immortal Souls that ſhall outlive their Bodies in a ſtate of Happineſs or Miſery; or if they know or believe that, yet they do not believe <hi>that there is no other name under Heaven by which they can be ſaved, but only the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> Nor ever had any experience of the Love of God to Souls. Their deriding of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Paſſions, and the Breathings of pious Souls after the Manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations of Divine Love, flows from their ignorance of them, and their unreaſonable Rudeneſs, in ſpeaking evil of the things which they know not. The original difference betwixt a perſon truly pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:61084:95"/>
and panting after the Love of Chriſt and others, lies here: Theſe Creatures know that they have Souls, Souls ordained to an eternal exiſtence, either in Hėll, or Heaven, in eternal Happineſs, or in eternal Miſery. They believe what God hath ſaid, that there is no other Name under Heaven by which Men and Women can be ſaved, but only the name of Jeſus Chriſt, neither is there Salvation in any other. That he that believeth on him is not condemned, and he that believeth not is damned already, the Wrath of God abideth on him, and he ſhall never ſee Life; they do not only read theſe things in their Bibles, and hear them from their Preachers, but the Holy Spirit of God hath firmly perſuaded them, that they do as fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly believe them, as they do any thing of ſenſible or rational De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration; they have more waky thoughts, with reference to Death; Mortality and Eternity, are things more in their Eyes than in the Eyes of others: Again, they have taſted and experienced more of the Love of Chriſt. Allow the Souls of others to be in the ſame Circumſtances, they would have alike Motions; but becauſe they are <hi>ignorant,</hi> knowing nothing of Spiritual Things, or at leaſt nothing as they ought to know it, thence it is that their Souls move not; this is now but the natural working of reaſonable Souls in other caſes, nor is there any ſuch unaccountable, or unintelligible thing in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Uſe 3.</note> And indeed this gives us the true Reaſon why every <hi>unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Soul is ſo cold in its motions toward Chriſt,</hi> and alſo may inform us <hi>how far it is poſſible ſuch a Soul may go in motions of this nature.</hi> The Reaſon why ſuch a Soul moves no more, is want of Evidence, which ſuch a Soul hath of the <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of his <hi>Loves.</hi> Simple Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Excellency in an Object, is not attractive of the Soul, but <hi>Goodneſs apprehended by, evidenced,</hi> and appearing to us.

All <hi>Knowledge</hi> which hath no better Foundation, will ariſe no higher than to beget in the Soul an Opinion, and leaves the Soul at ſome Incertainties, and unfixed, and hence its Motions towards an Object of which it hath no better Evidence, are alſo incertain and faint, and fluctuating. Knowledge being the Foundation of Deſire, Reaſon will tell us that the <hi>Deſire</hi> muſt bear proportion with the Knowledge. The unregenerate man,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:61084:96"/>
having no <hi>Knowledge of Spiritual things,</hi> that is productive of more than an <hi>Opinion,</hi> the deſire muſt be incertain and faint, according to the nature of the <hi>Opinion</hi> that cauſeth it.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Uſe 4.</note> By this alſo Chriſtians may be able to take ſome Meaſures, and make up ſome Judgments of themſelves, whether the deſires they find in their Souls after <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his <hi>Loves,</hi> be ſuch as are <hi>peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar to the Souls of Believers,</hi> yea or no. We uſually ſay that <hi>Deſires after Grace are Evidences of it,</hi> and there is a truth in it, but all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires are not ſo; for as I have ſaid, there may be <hi>deſires after Chriſt</hi> and <hi>his Loves,</hi> in an unregenerate Man, commenſurate to that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which he hath of the Goodneſs of them; but this will ſpeak nothing of good to the Soul, only ſuch <hi>Deſires,</hi> as flow from a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians <hi>Knowledge of Faith,</hi> and <hi>from Experience.</hi> He that hath only a <hi>knowledge</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Loves,</hi> from Reading the word, or from the <hi>Report of Miniſters,</hi> may ſo far deſire Chriſts Loves, as may ſerve him for his <hi>own ends,</hi> nay though he hath no great <hi>Faith</hi> as to that eternal State of Happineſs to which Chriſt brings the Soul, but hath only received Notions of ſuch ableſſed State, to which he gives no great credit, yet for his own Security, becauſe his notions may be true, though he hath no great fixed perſuaſion of them, he may yet deſire the <hi>Loves of Chriſt</hi> ſo far as to bring him to an everlaſting Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. As a Merchant that hath heard a Report of the rare Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, and cheapneſs of them, in a Country, which Report he doth not ſo far believe, as he will adventure an Hundred Pounds to try the Iſſue, yet may deſire the Commodities at ſuch Rates as he hears of; ſo may an unregenerate man that hath fate under the Preaching of the Goſpel, and heard abundantly of the Excellency of Chriſt, and the rare effects of his Love, though he will not do any thing toward the obtaining them, yet may wiſh that Chriſt lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him, that he might be made partaker of ſuch Love, though all this while in Heart he believeth little or nothing. That you may not therefore deceive your ſelves in this point, take a few notes of ſuch deſires as are indeed Evidences of Grace.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They are not <hi>meer velleities, lazy wiſhings,</hi> and <hi>wouldings</hi> as we ſay, <hi>but alwaies attended with the</hi> uſe of means <hi>which we judge or find proper to obtain our deſires.</hi> And indeed this alone without any<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thing further ſaid, will try this iſſue; a deſire ariſing from the <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> and <hi>experience</hi> a Soul hath of the goodneſs of an Object is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies attended with the uſe of what means are within our reach for the obtaining of it. Hence a Souls pretended deſire of <hi>the pardon of</hi>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:61084:96"/>
                  <hi>ſin through the blood of Chriſt,</hi> and of living with Chriſt in glory, not conjoined with fervent prayers, with an <hi>endeavour</hi> to reform our lives, and to ſin no more, is of no good <hi>ſignificancy</hi> at all. It is only an indication, that the man or woman would be happy, and ſecure as to eternity (if there be ſuch a thing which he hath heard;) but now when theſe deſires are attended, with ſad reflections upon our<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelves for ſin, ſerious indeavours againſt ſin, and hearty and fervent prayers to God for pardon, theſe things ſpeak the truth, and ſincerity of our deſires.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Deſires</hi> upon <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>experience</hi> of the <hi>goodneſs</hi> of a thing are alwaies moſt <hi>intenſe,</hi> and <hi>ſtrongeſt.</hi> If you obſerve it, the deſires of our Souls are augmented from a double cauſe 1. <hi>The certainty of our knowledge of that goodneſs which is in the thing deſired.</hi> 2. <hi>The quickneſs of our apprehenſion of the want of it:</hi> The more full, and certain knowledge that we have of the goodneſs and excellency of an Object the more we deſire it. For I told you before it is not the ſimple goodneſs, and excellency of a thing that draweth out our Souls after it, but our apprehenſion of ſuch a goodneſs, hence in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it muſt follow that the deſire muſt be ſtrongeſt in that Soul, where the <hi>apprehenſion</hi> is moſt full and certain. And all goodneſs being mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured by us by the ſuitableneſs of the thing to our wants, the <hi>quicker</hi> and <hi>fuller</hi> apprehenſions the Soul hath of its wants of Chriſt love, the ſtronger muſt the ſouls motions for, and towards it be. Now the believing Soul, having the moſt certain knowledge of the goodneſs of the <hi>Loves of Chriſt,</hi> and having alſo the fulleſt, and quickeſt appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of its wants of them, of neceſſity its pantings after them muſt be moſt intenſe, and ſtrong; <hi>As the Hart panteth after the Water Brooks</hi> (as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42. 1.) Hence it is that when the Prayers of Hypocrites are but complementings of God, a few words of courſe, the prayers of the Saints are <hi>wreſtlings with God</hi> (as <hi>Jacobs</hi> prayer is ſtiled) <hi>ſtrong cries, and groans which cannot be uttered</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.) where any Soul findeth ſuch <hi>deſires</hi> as theſe, it hath reaſon to rejoice, and be comforted concerning the truth of its grace, tho it findeth its <hi>actions imperfect,</hi> and Gods ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtations of himſelf to it in conſolatory influences not ſo full. In this ſenſe it is true, that deſires of grace, are indications of it, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded they be ſuch deſires, as flow from a <hi>knowledge,</hi> or any <hi>experience of Divine Love,</hi> I mean a <hi>knowledge of Faith,</hi> a certain firm perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion wrought in the heart of that goodneſs and excellency that is in Chriſt, and his loves, not a meer knowledge from report, and the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:61084:97"/>
credit of others, but ſuch deſires can never admit of a regardleſs careleſsneſs, whether the Soul obtaineth what it deſireth or no, but will be attended, with an inquiry after, and a due uſe of all means for the obtaining the thing deſired. And beſides, they will alwaies be <hi>ſtrong deſires</hi> according to the nature of the good deſired, and the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended degree of the Souls want of it; and hence again: The Soul that hath theſe <hi>true deſires,</hi> will find them attended with <hi>trouble</hi> and <hi>unquietneſs</hi> till <hi>it hath in ſome meaſure at leaſt obtained the thing</hi> which it deſireth, for as the wiſe man ſaith of <hi>Hope</hi> (ſo it is true of deſire) <hi>deferred it maketh the heart ſick.</hi> The Soul filled with deſires is like the Woman in Travel, pained till it obtaineth the thing deſired. <hi>As when the deſire is accompliſhed, it is ſweet to the Soul,</hi> Prov. 13. 19. So while it is accompliſhed, there muſt be ſome bitterneſs, and uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the Soul. But now deſires after Chriſt and his loves, atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with no trouble, no uneaſineſs for want of the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and obtaining of them, faint and cold, and languid deſires without the uſe of means within, our power to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the thing deſired are of no ſignificancy as to a truth of grace. <hi>Solomon</hi> hath two ſayings in his <hi>Proverbs</hi> that may be apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here. <hi>Prov.</hi> 13. 4. <hi>The Soul of the ſluggard deſireth, and hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but the Soul of the diligent ſhall be made fat.</hi> And <hi>Prov.</hi> 21. 25. <hi>The deſire of the ſlothful killeth him, for he refuſeth to labour.</hi> Two things are ſaid of the <hi>ſlothful ſluggard.</hi> 1. That he <hi>deſireth</hi> and <hi>hath nothing,</hi> he never obtaineth his deſire. 2. <hi>That his deſires kill him,</hi> they do him hurt, no good; what is the reaſon? <hi>Becauſe he refuſeth to labour: But the Soul of the diligent is made fat. Solomon</hi> ſpeaketh as to the things of this Life, <hi>The Soul of the ſluggard deſireth and hath nothing.</hi> It is as true as to Spiritual things, the <hi>Grace of God,</hi> the <hi>Loves of Chriſt.</hi> The Souls of <hi>Sluggards,</hi> that will ſometimes ſay, O that I had my part in Chriſt, O that my Iniquities might be pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, O that I might live with God in Glory, &amp;c. but never will do any thing toward theſe things, not ſo much as deny themſelves in a Luſt, nor keep under their Body, and bring it into Subjection in any thing; theſe Souls <hi>have nothing.</hi> The truth is they have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of any <hi>true</hi> deſire proceeding from any <hi>ſound knowledge,</hi> or any true <hi>experience,</hi> but <hi>they ſhall have nothing.</hi> Their Deſires <hi>kill them,</hi> if they truſt to theſe <hi>deſires of Grace,</hi> as <hi>Indications of a truth of Grace,</hi> they <hi>kill them,</hi> they cheat their own Souls to an eternal ruine, and deſtruction. <hi>But the diligent Soul is made fat.</hi> That Soul, that from a ſound and firm perſuaſion of the goodneſs, and excellency of the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:61084:97"/>
loves of Chriſt, deſires to taſt, and further to taſt of them, and is diligent in the uſe of means to have its deſires accompliſhed, <hi>that Soul ſhall be made fat.</hi> That Souls deſires ſhall be accompliſhed, tho it may ſee it falls ſhort of its duty in the uſe of means, and tho it may be God is not pleaſed to give the Soul the ſenſible manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of its love, ſo that its <hi>deſire</hi> is <hi>deferred,</hi> and while it is ſo differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the heart is pained, and it meets with ſome trouble and uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, through the not accompliſhing of its deſires to its ſenſe, yet, <hi>it ſhall be made fat.</hi> The hope of the righteous (ſaith <hi>Solomon) ſhall be gladneſs,</hi> ſo the deſire of ſuch a Soul; the diligent Soul, ſhall be ſatisfaction. This is according to the words of our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 6. <hi>Bleſſed are they which do hunger, and thirſt after righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for they ſhall be filled.</hi> Thus much I have thought fit to add in this place in anſwer to that queſtion, which we ſometimes meet with, <hi>Whether the deſire of grace be grace?</hi> A true reſolution of it is of mighty uſe ſometimes to Souls under <hi>melancholick</hi> diſtempers, or in <hi>an hour of temptation</hi> to relieve them, where they both want <hi>ſenſible manifeſtations,</hi> and a <hi>juſt view of the ſincerity of their own actions.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Uſe 5.</note> I ſhall ſhut up this diſcourſe with a <hi>word of exhortation.</hi> 1. <hi>To all to look to their deſires, their pretended deſires after Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>his loves.</hi> That of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 22. is a dreadful Curſe. <hi>If any man love not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt let him be</hi> Anathema, Maranatha, accurſed till the Lord come. Love is the complacency of the Soul in an object, the firſt fruit of its <hi>deſire.</hi> None hath a true complacency in an object, but he deſireth an union with it in ſuch a degree as he is capable of. Hence every one that liveth under the preaching of the Goſpel, and hath heard of Chriſt will pretend to deſire him. But one deſires him from a <hi>knowledge</hi> by <hi>hearſay</hi> of the goodneſs of his loves, another deſires him from a <hi>knowledge of faith, a ſetled perſuaſion of it wrought in his heart by the Spirit of God,</hi> and ſome taſts and experience of it; you have heard that the deſires of the Soul which ariſe from a knowledge of <hi>report</hi> and <hi>hearſay,</hi> are weak and faint, and cold and lazy, and will ſpeak no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of good for the Soul that hath them, you have heard the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>deſires</hi> are <hi>ſtrong,</hi> and <hi>intenſe,</hi> vehement and fervent, active and diligent. Nothing more relieveth a Soul ſometimes, than to find in itſelf; that though it wanteth a ſtrength to perform, yet to <hi>will is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with it,</hi> tho it cannot yet rejoice, and delight in the apprehenſion of his loves, yet for theſe are its deſires. Nothing more killeth and deſtroyeth a Soul, than to truſt to <hi>deſires of grace, as indications</hi>
                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:61084:98"/>
                  <hi>of it, which indeed are not ſo.</hi> O therefore look to your <hi>deſires</hi> after Chriſt. See that they proceed from <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>experience.</hi> For <hi>experience</hi> indeed it dependeth upon <hi>Divine influence,</hi> and breathing upon the Soul, and the holy Spirit of God like the wind breatheth where it pleaſeth. But ſee that your <hi>knowledge</hi> of the goodneſs of theſe loves be a <hi>knowledge of faith,</hi> not a meer <hi>knowledge</hi> from <hi>report</hi> and <hi>hearſay,</hi> as we may know many things of which we believe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; that is, we know ſuch things are written, reported, talkt of, rake heed this be not all the knowledge your Souls have of the loves of Chriſt. I have ſhewed you that the <hi>Knowledge of Faith,</hi> is a knowledge of perſuaſion of the excellency of the loves of Chriſt in themſelves (for I am not now diſcourſing of the perſuaſion that you have a particular intereſt in them) a firm, ſetled, conſtant perſuaſion of the Soul, that the love of Chriſt is the moſt deſirable good in Heaven or Earth, better then Wine yea better than life itſelf. This is the work of the Spirit of God in the Soul. A man can by no ſtudy perſuade himſelf of this, we can, by no art, no words, no ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of ours perſuade Souls of this. All that you can do, or which we can adviſe you to do in this caſe, in the uſe of ſuch means, to the uſe of which God hath promiſed his bleſſing, or in the uſe of which God ordinarily concurreth with his bleſſing. Theſe means are reducible to a few heads. 1. His <hi>Word.</hi> 2. His <hi>Sacrament.</hi> 3. <hi>Prayer.</hi> 4. A <hi>reformed holy life and Converſation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Word</hi> is the great means; he hath given you it in writing, that you may exerciſe your ſelves in it by reading, he hath appointed the <hi>Ordinance of Preaching,</hi> that you may receive it by <hi>your ears;</hi> neither <hi>reading</hi> nor hearing will beget in your Souls ſuch a knowledge of Chriſts love as will be productive of this knowledge which I call the <hi>knowledge of faith,</hi> but they are both means, means within our own power, and with the uſe of which God uſeth to concur, and in the neglect of which, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e can expect that the holy Spirit of God ſhould work ſuch a knowledge of the excellency of Chriſt and his loves, as will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of theſe deſires after them. The Word of God is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called the <hi>Word of faith,</hi> not only becauſe it containeth the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of what we are to believe, but becauſe it is that with the uſe of which God ordinarily concurreth in giving the Soul <hi>a power to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,</hi> therefore the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>That faith cometh by hearing.</hi> If you would <hi>know</hi> Chriſt, and his loves, read, <hi>hear the Word of God,</hi> and that in a conſcientious manner, but I have had occaſion to ſpeak of this under a former propoſition.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:61084:98"/>
2. The holy <hi>Sacrament</hi> is another means, at leaſt for a further <hi>knowledge of Chriſt and his loves,</hi> I am not of their minds who think that the Lords Supper is a means for conveighing the firſt <hi>knowledge of faith,</hi> concerning Chriſt and his Loves, to the Soul; if it had, Chriſt doubtleſs would have given it in commiſſion to his Apoſtles, not only to <hi>go</hi> and <hi>preach to,</hi> and <hi>Baptize all Nations,</hi> but alſo to <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter the Supper to them,</hi> which he did not if any will ſay, both <hi>Sacraments</hi> are intended, I ſhall not contend, but the Apoſtles pract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice expoundeth our Saviours precept, who <hi>baptized</hi> none till they <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,</hi> and made a profeſſion of their true faith in Chriſt, the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not a means for ignorant perſons and <hi>unbelievers,</hi> to come to the firſt knowledge of Faith, but an excellent means in order to the getting a further <hi>knowledge of Faith,</hi> that is a confirmation of their <hi>Faith</hi> in the love of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third means is <hi>Prayer.</hi> He gives his holy Spirit in all the manifeſtations of it to thoſe that ask him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The laſt I mentioned, was a reformed holy life and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. None know the loves of Chriſt more fully and effectually then thoſe Souls, who walk with him moſt cloſely. You know the promiſe of Chriſts manifeſtation of himſelf, is to thoſe that love him, and keep his commandments, but of theſe things I have before inlarged in my diſcourſes upon ſome former propoſitions.</p>

               <p>I Am now come to the laſt <hi>propoſition</hi> I obſerved from theſe words, which I told you might be either conſidered, <hi>As a Reaſon why ſhe deſired the tokens of Chriſts diſtinguiſhing loves,</hi> (a reaſon drawn from her <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>experience</hi> of the goodneſs, the tranſcendent goodneſs of them. In this notion I have already ſpoken to the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition ariſing from them, Or, 2. As an <hi>argument of her petition by which ſhe pleadeth with God, for the thing which ſhe deſired.</hi> An ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:61084:99"/>
drawn from the value ſhe ſet upon his love. From whence reſults this propoſition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop. 10.</hi> That our value, and eſtimate of the love of Chriſt above all other things is an excellent argument for a Soul to uſe with God for the obtaining of it.</p>
               <p>An <hi>argument</hi> is a <hi>mean</hi> brought either to <hi>prove a propoſition,</hi> or to <hi>move the Affections.</hi> The <hi>Logicians</hi> bring arguments to prove the juſt connexion of <hi>Subjects,</hi> and <hi>Predicates</hi> in propoſitions. The <hi>Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> uſeth them <hi>to move mens wills and affections,</hi> the buſineſs of the Soul with God in any prayer, is the buſineſs of an <hi>Orator;</hi> the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments</hi> he hath to uſe, are ſuch as may <hi>move God</hi> to beſtow the good things upon him which he deſireth. If you obſerve all the prayers of the Servants of God upon Sacred Record, you ſhall find them much to conſiſt of Requeſts, or Petitions, and <hi>arguments</hi> back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or inforcing thoſe requeſts. Theſe arguments you will obſerve drawn from ſeveral heads. Sometimes from the <hi>Nature of God.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>from their relation unto him.</hi> Sometimes <hi>from the promiſes made in the caſe.</hi> Sometimes <hi>from the greatneſs of their miſery.</hi> Sometimes <hi>from Gods Power and the freeneſs of his Grace.</hi> Pſal. 25. 7. <hi>According to thy mercy remember thou me for thy goodneſs ſake O Lord.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>from their faith, alliance to, and dependance upon God,</hi> Pſal. 25. 2. <hi>O my God I truſt in thee, let me not be aſhamed.</hi> So from various o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heads, I ſay amongſt others: <hi>A Souls juſt prizing and valuing of the loves of Chriſt,</hi> is an excellent argument for a Soul to uſe to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force a petition for them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The goodneſs or badneſs, the ſtrength or weakneſs of an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument derives wholly from its <hi>ſubſerviency</hi> to its end, its cogency, or no cogency. The <hi>End</hi> here aimed at is <hi>by prayer</hi> to <hi>obtain</hi> the loves of Chriſt, ſo as the goodneſs of the arguments to be uſed in this caſe depends upon the force they have with God to move him to grant the requeſts of our lips.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Perſuaſive arguments have their force either upon a <hi>natural ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,</hi> and that is moſtly from the infirmity of our Natures, which renders them ſubject to be affected with fine words, paſſionate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions; we muſt not imagine that God can be moved with any ſuch thing, and therefore fine phraſes in prayer are very inſignificant things: Or elſe upon a <hi>moral</hi> and <hi>rational account.</hi> As now amongſt men, if one can come to another, requeſting a favour from him, and ſay, Sir, <hi>you promiſed it me,</hi> there is a force in this argument, upon a <hi>moral and rational account,</hi> ſuch an argument is this, in this caſe.
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:61084:99"/>
If a Soul can go to God pleading for the manifeſtations of his love unto it, and truly tell him, that it valueth his love and favour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all created comforts, tho the bare naming of this, and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in fine, ſignificant words will do nothing with God in order to the obtaining of it, nay though this affection and temper of our Souls, can merit no influence of grace from God, yet conſidering the perſections of the Divine Nature, and the obligations which God hath laid upon himſelf. It will have a great moral vertue, and efficacy, and be of great force with him for the obtaining the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of Divine Grace, and the communications of his love.</p>
               <p>Hence I ſhall deſire you in the firſt place, to obſerve <hi>what frequent uſe the People of God have made of it in their applications to the Throne of Grace. David</hi> eſpecially, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42. 1, 2, 3. <hi>As the Hart panteth after the water-brooks, ſo panteth my Soul after thee O God; my Soul thirſteth for God, the Living God, when ſhall I come and appear before thee, O God?</hi> His Requeſt there lies in the laſt words, <hi>That he might come and appear before God,</hi> the Argument he uſeth is from <hi>the value he had for ſuch a mercy,</hi> ſo as the <hi>Hart</hi> did not more <hi>pant after the water-brooks.</hi> The ſame Argument he uſeth, and much in the ſame caſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84. 1, 2. The great Petition of that <hi>Pſalm</hi> was for a liberty again to enjoy God in his Ordinances; what is the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument he uſeth to enforce this Petition? <hi>How amiable are thy Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles, O Lord of Hoſts?</hi> V. 1. <hi>My Soul longeth, yea even fainteth for the Courts of the Lord; my heart and my fleſh cryeth out for the Living God.</hi> So he goes on in a variety of Phraſes, all expreſſing but his <hi>great value and eſtimate</hi> of ſuch a mercy, to that degree that he preferreth the condition of a poor Sparrow, or Swallow to his own in the want of it. You have him uſing the ſame Argument again, <hi>Pſal</hi> 63. 1, 2, 3. <hi>O God thou art my God, early will I ſeek thee; my Soul thirſteth for thee, my fleſh longeth for thee, in a dry and thirſty Land, where no water is. To ſee thy Power, and thy Glory, as I have ſeen Thee in the Sanctuary. Becauſe thy loving kindneſs is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than life.</hi> The Petition is much the ſame, and the Argument the ſame. I might inſtance in many other places of the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> but this is ſufficient: And certainly this were enough, if no more could be ſaid to juſtifie this Propoſition. That Argument which the man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to God's own heart uſed, and ſo often uſed, is certainly a good Argument, and of due force and efficacy; but this was an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument he often made uſe of. But I ſhall further ſhew you the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of this Argument from Reaſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:61084:100"/>
Firſt, This Argument ſpeaketh <hi>Chriſt in the Soul.</hi> What the Apoſtle ſaith in another caſe, <hi>No man calleth Jeſus Chriſt Lord but from the Spirit,</hi> may be applied in this. No man can truly ſay that he prizeth the Loves of Chriſt above Wine, above all created com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts whatſoever, but from the Spirit; none but the true Chriſtian, the truly ſpiritual man, ſets any conſiderable value upon Chriſt's Loves. <hi>To you that believe</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>he is precious.</hi> Now what <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſaid to his Brethren of <hi>Benjamin: Bring your Brother</hi> Benjamin, <hi>or ſee my face no more.</hi> God hath ſaid to every one of us, <hi>Bring Chriſt with you, or ſee not my face.</hi> We are all tranſgreſſors from the womb, and God heareth not ſinners for their own ſakes, but for Chriſt's ſake; therefore we are commanded to ask in Chriſt's Name. God indeed as our Father by Creation may hear us crying for <hi>temporal good things</hi> in the day of our wants; ſo he heareth the <hi>young Ravens when they cry for food to him.</hi> But we are bleſſed with <hi>Spiritual Bleſſings</hi> in Chriſt, and upon the account of Chriſt; he giveth the <hi>firſt grace</hi> upon the account of Chriſt's <hi>Interceſſion</hi> pleading for the Application of the purchaſed Redemption. He giveth <hi>further grace</hi> upon the account of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Interceſſion for us, and the <hi>Spirit's Interceſſion for us: For we know not what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit it ſelf maketh Interceſſion for us, with groanings which cannot be uttered; and he that ſearcheth the heart knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, becauſe he maketh Interceſſion for the Saints accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Will of God,</hi> Rom. 8. 26, 27. Now a due eſtimate and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of the Love of Chriſt in a Soul, is an Indication of the Spirit of Chriſt dwelling in the Soul; hence it muſt needs be an Argument of force with God; for <hi>he that ſearcheth the heart, knoweth the mind of the Spirit, making Interceſſion for the Saints, according to the will of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The force of this Argument lies here, in that <hi>it layeth hold upon many Promiſes.</hi> The Promiſes are but as ſo many Bonds in which God hath made himſelf a Debtor to his Creatures. All Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes oblige the truth and faithfulneſs of thoſe perſons that make them: God being the true and faithful One, cannot lye; <hi>He is faithful that hath promiſed</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle;) ſo that if it be a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Argument to uſe with a man to obtain any thing we would have, to tell him, <hi>He hath promiſed it,</hi> it holdeth towards God more ſtrongly, as his truth and faithfulneſs is much more certain and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible than any Creature is. Beſides that, it is a further advantage when Promiſes are made upon a due and juſt conſideration; for
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:61084:100"/>
theſe is not only the truth, but the juſtice alſo of the perſon promiſing is concerned to the fulfilling of them. Hence in Scripture you ſhall ordinarily find the Servants of God pleading the Word, the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of God, ſpoken to, and made with them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 49. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thy Word unto thy Servant, upon which thou haſt cauſed me to hope;</hi> and in many other Texts of Scripture. I ſay, when a Soul can go to God, and ſay in truth, that he valueth his <hi>love and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour</hi> above <hi>Wine,</hi> above <hi>Life,</hi> above all created comforts, this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment layeth hold upon ſeveral Promiſes of God. I will a little en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large upon this: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. It layeth hold upon <hi>a Promiſe of filling and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,</hi> Matth. 5. 6. <hi>Bleſſed are they who hunger and thirſt after Righteouſneſs, for they ſhall be filled.</hi> It is a mighty large and comprehenſive Promiſe. To fill a Soul with the influences of Divine Love, is a very great thing. It is not eaſie to fill the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous man with Wealth; but he may be ſooner fill'd with Riches, than the Soul of a good man with the Love and Grace of God. But here is a Promiſe of being filled: <hi>Open thy mouth wide</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>and I will fill it.</hi> To whom is this Promiſe made? <hi>To him that hungers and thirſteth after Righteouſneſs.</hi> Righteouſneſs is <hi>Grace,</hi> whether you take it for the <hi>Righteouſneſs of Juſtification,</hi> the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, in which every Soul muſt ſtand righteous before God: Or the <hi>Righteouſneſs of Sanctification,</hi> habits and acts of Holineſs wrought in us, and done by us, they are both from Grace, from the free Love of God ſhining upon our Souls. He that hungers and thirſts after it, is he that <hi>intenſely deſires it. Hunger</hi> and <hi>thirſt</hi> are natural <hi>paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi> ariſing in us from our want of due <hi>aliment;</hi> nature inforcing in us a ſenſe of that want, (and of all other) they are the moſt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement. Thence our Engliſh Proverb, <hi>Hunger will break through ſtone walls;</hi> and experience tells us, to what hard things theſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions have brought people, not only to eat Carrion, but to kill and eat their own Children; yea the fleſh of their own Arms; ſo as <hi>hungring and thirſting after Righteouſneſs,</hi> importeth vehement deſires after <hi>Grace,</hi> which deſires teſtifie the Soul's eſtimate of it, and value for it; and to thoſe who thus hunger and thirſt the Promiſe is made, that they ſhall be filled.</p>
               <p>Again, ſuch a Soul hath a right to thoſe Promiſes of <hi>all Grace</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in the <hi>moſt large and comprehenſive terms,</hi> and general phraſes; as where God promiſeth a <hi>new heart,</hi> the <hi>water of life,</hi> his <hi>coming unto Souls, dwelling in them, abiding with them.</hi> The Soul that can go to God; and truly ſay,, that he prizeth the <hi>Loves</hi> of Chriſt
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:61084:101"/>
above all things, layeth hold of all theſe Promiſes of which the holy Scriptures are full, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 1, 2. <hi>Ho every one that thirſteth, come you to the waters, and buy, without money, and without price, buy wine and milk.</hi> So <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 17. <hi>Let him that is athirſt come, and whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever will, let him drink of the water of life freely.</hi> Joh. 14. 23. <hi>If any man love me, he will keep my words, and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.</hi> So <hi>v.</hi> 21. <hi>He that loveth me, ſhall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and manifeſt my ſelf to him.</hi> Theſe now, and ſuch like, are general Promiſes comprehenſive of all the Love of Chriſt to the Soul, in the various manifeſtations of it, according to the Soul's di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſified neceſſities, with reſpect to its ſeveral circumſtances. Now obſerve to whom theſe Promiſes are made, to <hi>thoſe that love Chriſt,</hi> and in evidence of that love, <hi>hunger and thirſt after him,</hi> to them the Promiſes are made, 1. That the Father will love that man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. 2. That both Chriſt, and his Father, will come unto him. 3. That they will manifeſt themſelves unto them; that they will dwell, and make their abode with them. That they ſhall have Wine and Milk without <hi>money</hi> and <hi>price.</hi> Now I appeal to any ordinary capacity, what evidence of <hi>Love</hi> any Soul can give greater, than the valuing of his Loves above all other things. So that, where this can be ſaid in truth to God, God is challenged upon a multitude of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, even ſo many as are made, to the Love of God, and Chriſt, and to the Soul's <hi>hungrings</hi> and <hi>thirſtings</hi> after him. Nay, there is yet another ſort of Promiſes, which ſuch a Soul challengeth, <hi>viz.</hi> all thoſe Promiſes of a further ſupply and increaſe of Grace to thoſe that have the <hi>Seed of Grace:</hi> As <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 12. <hi>To him that hath ſhall be given, and he ſhall have in more abundance.</hi> I might add many more of like nature; but there is hardly any of you but know how to furniſh your ſelves with them. Now where the Soul can challenge God upon a Promiſe, and lay claim to the mercy which it asketh, from an obligation which God by his Word hath laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf, to give it: This is a great Argument, for it toucheth God upon the account of his Truth and Faithfulneſs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Further yet this argument toucheth God as he is <hi>a tender Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> God (you know) to let us know his heart to his poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, amongſt other names of relation hath taken to him that of a <hi>Father,</hi> to let us know there is in his <hi>gracious nature</hi> ſomething <hi>analogous</hi> or proportionable to the heart and bowels of Earthly Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents to their Children, and accordingly our Saviour argues, that <hi>if</hi>
                  <pb n="193" facs="tcp:61084:101"/>
                  <hi>any of our Children ask of us bread, we will not give them a Stone, nor a Scorpion</hi> inſtead of <hi>Fiſh,</hi> and thence concludeth, that if we <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evil know how to give good things to our Children, much more will our Heavenly Father give good things to them that ask him.</hi> You, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of you <hi>know the heart of a Father.</hi> To which of you would it not be a great argument, to draw you out to any acts by which you could manifeſt your loves to a Child, for your Child to come, and beg your love to it, telling you, that it valueth your love above all things in the world, that it had rather have your love, your heart to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it, than have all the eſtate you can give it? Shall there not be ſomething in the heart of God proportionated to this affection in your hearts? Is it poſſible that a Child of God, ſhould come to God, and in ſincerity ſay to him; <hi>Father!</hi> I beg ſome tokens of thy ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial diſtinguiſhing love to my Soul, thou that knoweſt all things, knoweſt that I love thee, and that my Soul doth value thy loves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all that the world affords, and Gods heart ſhould not yearn, and his bowels melt towards ſuch a Soul? God muſt ſay of the voice of ſuch a Soul, as <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſometimes ſaid, <hi>It is the voice of my Son Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob.</hi> None but a Child can ſpeak ſuch a language.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Finally. <hi>No arguments can be of more force to uſe with God, than ſuch wherein the Intereſt of his own glory is concerned.</hi> The Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God being his own great end, which he purſueth in all his actions, he uſeth a great argument to God, that ſaith unto him, <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther glorify thy ſelf.</hi> So gracious is God, that he gives us leave to fetch arguments from our ſelves, our own wants, and the miſery we are in, which arguments affect God, as he is a God full of pity and tender compaſſion. But thoſe arguments which we can fetch from the <hi>Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of his own glory,</hi> ſeem to have a greater force, as complying with what is the Lords great and chiefeſt end. He that ſets an high value and eſtimate upon the love of Chriſt, giveth God a great deal of Glory, preferring him to all things in the world, for God cannot be more glorified by the Creature, than to be in heart eſteemed above, and preferred to the whole Creation. So as that Soul that goeth to God with this argument, doth in effect ſay; Father! my Soul hath glorified thee upon the Earth, and doth give thee the glory of being the moſt excellent object, and more deſirable than all the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides. Now therefore glorify thy ſelf in manifeſting of thy love to me, that I may further exalt thee in thy rich and free Grace. I now come to the application.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Uſe 1.</note> By way of Inſtruction, firſt, we may obſerve, <hi>That the meaneſt</hi>
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:61084:102"/>
                  <hi>Child of God is furniſhed with a better argument to encourage his hopes in his addreſſes to the throne of Grace, than the greateſt and proudeſt Sinner in the world hath.</hi> There are arguments, which Sinners may uſe, from the <hi>infiniteneſs,</hi> and <hi>freeneſs</hi> of the divine <hi>bounty</hi> and <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> from <hi>their relation to God, as his Creatures,</hi> from <hi>the greatneſs of their miſery,</hi> &amp;c. and they may obtain ſomething from God upon theſe pleas, from that infinite goodneſs, and compaſſion that is in the Divine Nature; but no <hi>unregenerate man</hi> can uſe this argument which hath in it a much greater force. On the other ſide, there is no the meaneſt child of God, not the meaneſt believer that is in the world but hath this argument to uſe with God. Other arguments may be of avail with God for the obtaining ſome good things of this life, this is of force for the obtaining thoſe of higheſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence relating to the internal, and eternal happineſs of the Soul.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Uſe 2.</note> Secondly, This offers us a great incouragement to examine our ſelves upon this point, <hi>Whether we have a due eſtimate of the loves of Chriſt,</hi> Whether we can truly ſay to our bleſſed Lord, <hi>That his loves are better than Wine,</hi> and that we value them not only above all <hi>ſenſual ſatisfactions,</hi> which the profane ſcandalous Sinner doeth not, but above all <hi>ſenſible ſatisfactions,</hi> which no unregenerate carnal man doth. I remember when our Saviour examined <hi>Peter</hi> about his love to him, he propounded to him this queſtion, <hi>Joh.</hi> 21. 15. Simon Peter <hi>loveſt thou me more than theſe?</hi> I do know that many Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters by [theſe] in that Text underſtand <hi>his other Diſciples</hi> ſtanding by. There was a time when <hi>Peter</hi> preferred himſelf (as to his love towards his Maſter) to all the other Diſciples: Tho (ſaith he) all ſhould deny thee, yet I would not deny thee. <hi>Peter</hi> ſince that time was humbled, our Saviour had a mind that his humility ſhould be manifeſted, and therefore (ſay ſome) he propoundeth that queſtion to him: but I remember <hi>Bernard</hi> in one of his Sermons upon the <hi>Canticles</hi> puts another ſenſe upon the words, <hi>Loveſt thou me more than thou loveſt theſe?</hi> and ſo it may be referred either to the <hi>compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> with whom he was, or to the <hi>diverſion</hi> of <hi>fiſhing,</hi> they were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in, or to the <hi>great draught of fiſh,</hi> which they had taken. I do but allude to the text, who ſo truly loveth the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, if all the perſons, and things in the world were before him, muſt be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſay, <hi>I love Chriſt more than theſe.</hi> Admit his friends and nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt relations to be in his Eye, all the pleaſant and delectable things in the world, all the Crowns and Scepters, and honours in the world, all the Gold, and Silver, and Houſes, and Lands in the world in his
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:61084:102"/>
Eye: He muſt be able to ſay, <hi>I love the Lord Jeſus Chriſt more than theſe;</hi> yea if his own <hi>life</hi> be ſet before him, not to be enjoyed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the loſs of Chriſts love, he muſt be able to ſay that he loves Chriſt more than that, Mat. 10. 37. <hi>He that loveth Father or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more than me, is not worthy of me, and he that loveth Son or Daughter more than me, is not worthy of me,</hi> Lu. 14. 26. <hi>If any man come to me, and hate not his Father and Mother, and Wife, and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and Brethren, and Siſters, yea and his own life alſo, he cannot be my Diſciple.</hi> But I have formerly given you ſome directions how to try your ſelves, whether the loves of Chriſt in the apprehenſion of your Souls are <hi>good before Wine,</hi> and ſhall therefore add no more on this argument.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Uſe 3.</note> In the third place; This notion may be of great uſe to relieve Chriſtians doubting <hi>whether they have any one good Argument to uſe with God in their applications to him.</hi> 2. <hi>Whether any of their Prayers have at any time pierced the Heavens, and been accepted of God.</hi> A good Chriſtian is often doubting, whether he may go to God or no; whether he hath one good Argument to uſe, which may be of avail with God. We have many words to ſay, many <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> to uſe; and when it is a clear day with the Soul, it can eaſily diſcern it, and fill its mouth with words of ſeveral natures; but in a dark day, under the prevailings of Melancholy, or boiſterous Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, it can find many Arguments to deter it from Addreſſes to God, its own vileneſs and unworthineſs conſidered with God's purity and holineſs, the multitude of its ſins, its former Prayers (as it fancieth) lying by not anſwered, but it cannot find one Argument to incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage it. But every Chriſtian hath at all times many Arguments, if he could diſcern them. <hi>David</hi> made his vileneſs and unworthineſs an Argument, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25. <hi>Pardon mine iniquity</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>for it is great.</hi> That's an Argument all have, and at all times. Ah! but (ſaith the Soul) this is no other than the vileſt perſon hath: He may plead the <hi>freeneſs of Divine Grace.</hi> The Soul that goeth to God for Free Grace, can never want an Argument, but ſtill this is common, and no more encouraging a Believer, than another man. We may <hi>plead our own miſery,</hi> and ſad ſtate; miſery is the object of <hi>Grace and Mercy;</hi> but ſtill this is common. The vileſt ſinner may go and plead with God for mercy, becauſe his ſtate is miſerable. A true Chriſtian would have an Argument of a more ſpecial nature, and ſuch a one as in the uſe of, he could go boldly and with confidence to the Throne of Grace. Admitting this Propoſition, every good
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:61084:103"/>
Chriſtian hath ſuch an Argument; ſuch an Argument as no unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate man hath, ſuch an Argument as he may go to God with, with boldneſs and confidence: God was never yet wanting to the truly hungring and thirſty Soul after his Love; ſuch an Argument as if pleaded with God, and being in truth, alwaies prevailed with God.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Uſe 4.</note> I ſhall ſhut up this Diſcourſe with ſome few words of Exhortation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To all: To labour to bring up their hearts to this, to prize the favour of God <hi>above all other things whatſoever.</hi> How you ſhall know whether your <hi>hearts be brought up to it or no,</hi> I have before ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you; but ſuffer me here to give you ſome Directions in the caſe, and to preſs it with ſome Arguments. Until we do find that our Souls do ſet ſuch an eſtimate upon the Loves of Chriſt, we can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver uſe it as an Argument with God. This is therefore the firſt thing which we have to do, to be reſtleſs till we find that we can ſay it in truth, that we value <hi>Chriſt's Loves above all earthly things.</hi> Nor will this ever be effectually done, till the holy Spirit of God comes upon our hearts with its impreſſions and demonſtrations; all that we can do will bear no more than the notion of means in order to that bleſſed end. Of that nature much may be directed.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Let thy Soul and its immortal ſtate, with its condition re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring to that ſtate, be much in thy thoughts.</hi> It is one great reaſon why men neglect and are careleſs as to the <hi>Loves of Chriſt,</hi> becauſe they do not remember they have <hi>immortal Souls,</hi> nor conſider any future ſtate, or their own circumſtances relating to it. Men know that they have bodies, and experience hunger, and thirſt, and cold, and ſo are very buſie in taking care what they ſhall <hi>eat,</hi> and <hi>drink,</hi> and <hi>put on,</hi> but they do not know, at leaſt they do not attend to their knowledge of it, and have no certain knowledge and perſuaſion that they have <hi>immortal Souls,</hi> that can no more die with the body, than eat, drink, or ſleep with it, ſo as they take no further care than for their outward man. Neither do they attend to the conſideration of the condition of their Souls with reſpect to an eternal exiſtence, but run away with preſumptuous fancies that God will not ſuffer them to periſh for ever; determining concerning their Souls accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their fancies, and the dictates of their own vitiated reaſon, not according to the revelations of the Divine Will; would men think more of their Souls, and conſider the immortality of them, would they determine concerning them, according to <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> it were impoſſible they ſhould ſo far, as generally they do, neglect the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:61084:103"/>
care of them. They would quickly ſee that all the good things of the world could not affect the Soul with any good, and therefore muſt needs be invaluable things compared with thoſe things that will ſecure the Souls happineſs both here and for ever. If men believed they had immortal Souls, their reaſon would teach them quickly to conclude that they are better than the body, which is but earth, and which muſt return to duſt and conſequently whatſoever is <hi>good for the Soul,</hi> muſt be infinitely more good than what only ſerveth the neceſſities of our earthly part, and that neither but for a little time. But the truth is, as <hi>the Fool hath ſaid in his heart there is no God:</hi> So he hath alſo ſaid in his Heart, I have no Soul, no ſuch immortal ſubſtance as Preachers talk of, there is no ſuch thing as Heaven, or Hell; moſt unregenerate men are in their Hearts <hi>Atheiſts.</hi> The natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral reaſon of all men teacheth them to look after their concerns and intereſts, and to prefer greater, before leſſer intereſts, and to value what makes for their greateſt intereſts, above what is only ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to an intereſt of leſſer value. Mens preference of created com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts before the loves of Chriſt proceedeth meerly from their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that they have Souls to look after, or at leaſt unbelief of it, if they notionally know it, their not underſtanding the nature, and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual concerns of their Souls, or at leaſt their erronious fancies and conceptions, of an univerſal Salvation of all, or all at leaſt that are baptized; the firſt thing to be done rationally to poſſeſs Men and Women of the excellency of Chriſts loves, above <hi>Wine,</hi> above all ſenſual things, or any ſenſible things, is to poſſeſs men of this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and to keep their Eyes waking to the conſideration of it, and to engage them to take their meaſures of theſe things from the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the will of God, in his word, not from their own wild fancies, and ratiocinations.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Poſſeſs your Souls <hi>of the impoſſibility of their receiving of any good, any thing ſuited to their neceſſities, but only from Chriſt.</hi> There is no other <hi>name given under Heaven, there is no Salvation in any other.</hi> The power over all Souls is committed unto Chriſt. The Father forgives Sins, but it is for <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>ſake; as God for Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>ſake hath forgiven you</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) we have <hi>Redemption, forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Sin through his blood.</hi> In him we have <hi>righteouſneſs, peace,</hi> through him we have <hi>acceſs,</hi> an <hi>entrance</hi> into the <hi>hol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eſt of all;</hi> the Father <hi>hath given unto him Eternal life, that he ſhould give it to whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he pleaſeth.</hi> There is no good thing ſuited to a <hi>Souls wants,</hi> but it deriveth from Chriſt. Good things ſuited to the more exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:61084:104"/>
wants of our Body, derive from God as the great preſerver of man, and flow from that common providence of his which dayly worketh in the upholding and preſervation of created Beings; but good things for our <hi>Souls</hi> derive from <hi>Chriſt</hi> as Mediator, and as they are purchaſed by his blood, ſo they are diſpenſed out by his Spirit. This now can appear to a Soul from no other light but that of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,</hi> ſtudy therefore the holy Scriptures, meditate therein night and day, they teſtify all this concerning Chriſt. A full perſuaſion of theſe two things, 1. <hi>That we have immortal Souls, ordained to an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> either of <hi>happineſs or miſery.</hi> 2. <hi>That nothing but the love of Chriſt can furniſh them with thoſe good things which are proper, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for them, with reſpect to their Eternal Happineſs,</hi> are enough to convince Men and Women that the loves of Chriſt are <hi>as much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than Wine,</hi> and to be preferred to it, as the Soul is better than the Body, and the things ſuited to its wants, better than thoſe things which are only ſuited to the wants of the outward man. But ſtill I ſay, and every days experience, maketh it good, <hi>Non perſuaſeris etiamſi perſuaſeris,</hi> you ſhall not perſuade Men and Women, tho you ſay enough to perſuade them, though you ſhut up their mouths, and they having nothing to ſay, ſuch a power hath luſt in the heart of man, into ſuch a debauchery is the nature of man degenerated. Admitting men to believe, <hi>that they have immortal Souls,</hi> and <hi>that the Holy Scriptures are the Word of God,</hi> there is nothing in nature hath a fuller evidence than this truth, <hi>that the loves of Chriſt are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrible to all things in the world,</hi> and a man cannot act like a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble creature in preferring any thing unto them; yet who believes it? who lives up to this demonſtration? It is God <hi>muſt perſuade the Soul of this,</hi> and till the Soul hath this written and ingraven upon it by the finger of his Spirit, it will never ſo Judge. Laſtly therefore,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pray mightily</hi> that God would <hi>open your Ears,</hi> to ſee this, and <hi>perſuade your Souls</hi> of the truth of it, for till he doth it, in vain are mens perſuaſions. To move you to it, conſider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>This will bear ſome proportion to the love of Chriſt to mankind.</hi> Chriſt loved us <hi>more than theſe,</hi> more than all the <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> and <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures</hi> and <hi>profits,</hi> and honours of the world, yea more than his <hi>own life,</hi> yea he preferred us to the Angels, the fallen Angels, for he took not upon him the nature of Angels, but the nature of man.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This will ſpeak the Soul to be a <hi>wiſe and underſtanding Soul.</hi> Certain it is (as I have already ſhewed you) <hi>that the loves of Chriſt are good before Wine.</hi> The wiſdom of a Soul lyeth much in a <hi>right</hi>
                  <pb n="199" facs="tcp:61084:104"/>
                  <hi>diſcerning</hi> betwixt good and evil, and betwixt that which is good, and that which is more good or better. The <hi>excellency</hi> of a Soul lyeth in its conformity to God, he is an Atheiſt who owneth not God to be the <hi>firſt Being,</hi> and to be of all Beings, <hi>the moſt excellent, and perfect Being.</hi> So as neceſſarily, that Soul that comes neareſt in conformity to God, muſt be the moſt excellent Soul, now that Soul which acteth moſt up to the principles of improved and pure reaſon, and to the rule of that holy Writ, which we all confeſs to be the revealed Will of God, and liveth moſt up to the Divine Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, doing what God doth, that muſt needs be the moſt wiſe, excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, underſtanding Soul. Now will not a little reaſon ſerve to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us that Chriſt is the moſt excelling Object, and therefore to be preferred to all ſublunary enjoyments? Doth not the Scripture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent him to us as <hi>altogether deſires,</hi> as the <hi>chiefeſt of ten thouſand,</hi> as the <hi>well beloved of the Father in whom he is well pleaſed,</hi> as he whom we ought <hi>to love with all our heart, all our Soul, all our Strength?</hi> Doth not the Father, the Heavenly Father love him above all other objects? <hi>To which of the Angels ſaid he at any time. Thou art my Son, this day I have begotten thee;</hi> and again, <hi>I will be to him a Father, and he ſhall be to me a Son,—He was brought up with the Father, and daily his delight, rejoycing alwaies before him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>This will ſpeak an heavenly ſublimated Soul,</hi> purged from the dregs of <hi>ſenſuality</hi> and from an <hi>earthly mind,</hi> a Soul <hi>riſen with Chriſt,</hi> and ſeeking the things which are above, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 1. The preference of <hi>Wine,</hi> any ſenſual ſatisfactions, or any ſenſible enjoyments to the <hi>loves of Chriſt,</hi> ſpeaks a dirty Soul, that feedeth upon carrion, and can be filled with wind.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>You have heard what an argument this will ſupply a Soul with in all its addreſſes and applications to God for any grace or favour,</hi> no argument can be more moving, more prevailing with God, none that layeth hold upon more promiſes, or that toucheth God more as a tender Father. O therefore labour for this frame of Spirit, and give your Souls no reſt until you find that they indeed do prefer the love of Chriſt before all other things in Heaven and Earth.</p>

               <p n="2">2. <hi>Many gracious diſpoſitions,</hi> which eminently dwelling in the God-Head from all Eternity, were alſo by the Spirit, poured out upon the <hi>Humane Nature</hi> in his Incarnation. Theſe are here called by a <hi>Metaphor Ointments,</hi> and good <hi>Ointments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1. Becauſe</hi> by the communication of theſe from the Divine to the Humane Nature, in the perſonal union of both Natures in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, Chriſt was ſanctified and ſet apart, and conſtituted as a perſon fit to be our High Prieſt <hi>and</hi> King.</p>
               <p>This (as I told you in my laſt diſcourſe) was one of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred uſes of Oil, which the Jews made, there was a ſweet anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Oil, made by Gods ſpecial preſcript, for the conſecration of the High Prieſt, the Tabernacle, and their holy Utenſils; with this alſo they anointed their Kings. This did but typify the <hi>anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> and by the receiving of this <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> Chriſt was <hi>conſtituted</hi> our <hi>High-Prieſt,</hi> and <hi>the King upon the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Hill of</hi> Sion. By the Grace of <hi>Hypoſtatical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion he was made ſo:</hi> I mean by the union of the Divine and Humane Nature in the one Perſon of Chriſt. Chriſt indeed had an <hi>Eſſential Kingdom,</hi> equal with the Father by his <hi>Eternal Generation,</hi> but he obtained his <hi>Mediatory Kingdom,</hi> by vertue of his <hi>Incarnation,</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The new and living way was conſecrated for us through the vail, that is to ſay, his fleſh,</hi> Thus he was made <hi>our High-Prieſt, our King, our Prophet;</hi> and by his gracious <hi>diſpoſitions</hi> and <hi>qualifications,</hi> he was made fit for a Mediator. <hi>For ſuch an High Prieſt became us, who is holy, harmleſs, undefiled, ſeparate from Sinners, and made</hi>
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:61084:107"/>
                  <hi>higher than the Heavens, who needed not daily as thoſe High Prieſts</hi> (under the law) to offer up Sacrifice, firſt for his own Sins, then for the People, &amp;c. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 26. 27.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Graces</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> were like <hi>good Oils,</hi> or <hi>Ointments, as they were uſed in Sacrifice,</hi> they cannot indeed ſo properly be called a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> but they were as the <hi>Oyl</hi> poured <hi>upon the meat offering.</hi> There is a diſpute whether the <hi>Paſſive Obedience of Chriſt</hi> only, or his <hi>Active obedience</hi> alſo, be <hi>imputed to us,</hi> and be <hi>our righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> not to meddle with that, ſuppoſing his <hi>paſſive obedience</hi> to have alone been the <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> yet his <hi>Active obedience</hi> muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, as the <hi>Oyl</hi> poured upon it. The meat offering was uſually <hi>ſome Beaſt</hi> or <hi>Bird</hi> ſlain, but then they were to come, and pour Oyl upon it. Chriſts death upon the Croſs was his <hi>offering:</hi> That was the <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> but his <hi>Graces</hi> were as the <hi>Oyl</hi> poured upon this <hi>offering,</hi> had not he that died been <hi>pure,</hi> and <hi>holy,</hi> righteous, and ſeparate from ſinners, meek, obedient, &amp;c. he could not have been accepted for others, for he muſt have offered for himſelf, as the Apoſtle teacheth us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 26, 27. Thus his perſonal <hi>graces,</hi> and <hi>perfections,</hi> were like <hi>good Oils,</hi> with reſpect to the uſe of Oil in Sacrifice, upon the account of them it was that he offered up to his Father a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> for the Sins of his People, which was acceptable.</p>
               <p>Thirdly. The <hi>Perſonal Graces and perfections of Chriſt, were like good Oils for their ſweet ſavour.</hi> Theſe perfections are thoſe things which make the name, and perſon of Chriſt as a ſweet ſmelling ſavour in the Noſtrils of every underſtanding gracious Soul; what is it which maketh any Soul love Chriſt; what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth its own private meditations of him, or the report which it receiveth of him, ſo exceeding ſweet to the Soul, but theſe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies and perfections, which are in him: <hi>His free, and infinite love,</hi> to the Sons and Daughters of Men, <hi>his pity and compaſſion, his ſlowneſs to conceive a wrath, and readineſs to forgive, his freeneſs to heal his Peoples backſlidings,</hi> his <hi>purity,</hi> and <hi>holineſs,</hi> his <hi>patience</hi> and <hi>meekneſs:</hi> Theſe are thoſe things which make Chriſt appear ſo lovely, and amiable to gracious Souls. Laſtly like <hi>good Oils, they ſerve the Soul for food.</hi> What doth a Soul that hungereth, and thirſteth after Righteouſneſs ſeed upon, but the <hi>Righteouſneſs of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> (ſome indeed have found a <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of their own to feed upon, but I doubt whether thoſe Souls that feed on nothing elſe will appear <hi>fair,</hi> and <hi>well liking</hi> in the great
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:61084:107"/>
day of the Lord:) Suppoſe a Soul pined away in the ſenſe of its iniquities, what doth it live upon, but only the free Grace and mercy of God in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt? As <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſaid in another caſe; <hi>By theſe things men live:</hi> ſo doth every Spiritual Soul make uſe of the Grace of Chriſt, and may ſay: <hi>By the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt I live,</hi> by thelove, pity, and <hi>tender mercies of Lord Jeſus Chriſt I live:</hi> By <hi>his fulneſs of grace I live,</hi> for, <hi>of his fulneſs we receive Grace for Grace.</hi> Thus you ſee how upon all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, <hi>The grace of Chriſt is like good Ointments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But thus much generally. We are upon a <hi>Bed of Spices,</hi> it is good for us to be here, let me therefore ſpeak a little more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, ſhewing you particularly:</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Qu. 3.</note> What theſe Graces of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt are, which are upon all theſe accounts, as good Oils, or good Ointments.</p>
               <p>I ſhall anſwer this in ſeveral particulars:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Grace of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, is as a good O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>l.</hi> There is a three-fold Union conſiderable with reference to Chriſt. 1. <hi>His Eternal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with his Father.</hi> This is what he ſaith in the Goſpel once, and again, <hi>I and my Father are one,</hi> but it is not proper to call this Grace. It was natural; his <hi>Generation</hi> who can declare? 2. The ſecond is the <hi>Hypoſtatical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> of the <hi>Divine,</hi> and <hi>Humane Nature,</hi> in the <hi>One Perſon</hi> of the <hi>Mediator.</hi> This was <hi>Grace,</hi> the aſſumption of our Nature, to make one Perſon, with the Divine Nature, this was an <hi>act of Grace;</hi> it was not Natural, not Eternal, but the product of Divine, and free <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> time. It was the <hi>Grace</hi> both of the <hi>firſt</hi> and of the <hi>ſecond</hi> Perſon in the Trinity, to aſſume humane nature into an Union with the ſecond Perſon. 3. <hi>There is an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of Chriſt with Believers, I in you</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>and you in me.</hi> Theſe are myſteries (the two latter I mean) not to be <hi>fully known,</hi> and <hi>underſtood,</hi> until Chriſts ſecond coming. <hi>At that</hi> day (ſaith our Bleſſed Lord) <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 20. <hi>You ſhall know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and Lin you.</hi> That there is ſuch a thing we know, how it is we do not know: but in the mean time this is alſo of Grace. This in the ſecond ſenſe is <hi>terminated in Chriſt,</hi> in the laſt it is terminated in the truly <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Soul.</hi> I am ſure both are as good Oils. That <hi>Grace</hi> which was both from the Father, and himſelf conſidered as God, by which our Nature was aſſumed into a oneneſs with the Second
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:61084:108"/>
Perſon in the God-Head. This is like a good Oil, this was the <hi>ſweet</hi> anointing Oil of his <hi>Conſecration,</hi> by this he Was conſtituted out <hi>High-Prieſt,</hi> capacitated to offer a Sacrifice to his Father, both <hi>meritorious,</hi> and <hi>acceptable.</hi> As God he could <hi>not die,</hi> as meerly the Son of man he could not <hi>merit,</hi> as <hi>God-man,</hi> he could do both. O this makes Chriſt exceeding lovely in the Eyes of a Spiritual intelligent Soul: Chriſt as God is full of <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Majeſty;</hi> but his <hi>Glory is inviſible,</hi> his <hi>Majeſty is incomprehenſible;</hi> but now <hi>when the Word was made fleſh, and came and dwelt amongſt us,</hi> then as the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> ſaith) <hi>we beheld his glory, as the glory of the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begotten Son of the Father, full of Grace and Truth.</hi> All the comfort of a Soul dependeth upon Chriſts Incarnation, and what he did, and ſuffered, as <hi>manifeſted in the fl ſh. Oh!</hi> how ſweet this is to the Soul to think of this, together with the ſatisfaction, which by vertue of this, he gave to Divine Juſtice, and the <hi>daily interceſſion</hi> which he makes, together with the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that in <hi>this Capacity</hi> he entred into the Heavens, <hi>as our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner;</hi> and we ſit together with, and <hi>in him in heavenly places</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) are matters of exceeding ſweet <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;</hi> upon theſe the Soul liveth, and ſupporteth its faith. The Grace of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> alſo conſidered in the laſt notion is exceeding ſweet. This Grace is rooted in Chriſt, and terminated in the Soul. By this the Soul is conſecrated to God, by vertue of this it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated a <hi>Prieſt</hi> to offer up <hi>Spiritual Sacrifices to God acceptable through the beloved;</hi> by this it is comforted and refreſhed, when it is terrified with the thoughts of the diſunion with God, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> and that ſeparation which its daily ſins make betwixt God and it: By this the Soul liveth its <hi>Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al life,</hi> for <hi>Spiritual life</hi> lies in the union of the Soul with God, which is made by, and in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>The Grace of Love</hi> in Chriſt, is as a ſweet Oil or Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: That <hi>holy diſpoſition which is in him, by which he takes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the Sons of Men, willeth them good</hi> with reſpect to their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral capacities. <hi>God is love</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>Chriſt is Love</hi> as he is God, but as <hi>Mediator</hi> he is infinitely <hi>full of love;</hi> his pardoning Grace, is nothing but <hi>free love</hi> reſpecting a guilty creature, his <hi>heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, reſtoring</hi> Grace is <hi>free love</hi> reſpecting a backſliding Soul. <hi>I will heal your backſlidings, and love you freely.</hi> He hath in him <hi>comfort</hi> for them that are ſad, <hi>ſtrength</hi> for them that are <hi>weak;</hi> now is not this <hi>an Ointment that giveth a good ſavour?</hi> I appeal to any Soul
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:61084:108"/>
that hath been <hi>pricked at the heart for ſin,</hi> and felt the load and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of it: How ſweet hath it been to a Soul to apprehend the Lord Jeſus Chriſt as one who <hi>pardoneth its iniquities!</hi> How ſweet hath it been to a Soul ſmitten with the ſenſe of its <hi>backſlidings,</hi> to apprehend Chriſt as one who healeth <hi>backſlidings,</hi> and hath mercy even for the <hi>rebellious</hi> alſo! When a Soul is diſcouraged at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended <hi>difficulty of duty,</hi> the <hi>ſtrength</hi> and <hi>prevailings</hi> of ſin, <hi>and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,</hi> how ſweet is it to the Soul to think of Chriſt's ſtrengthening grace, the Promiſes againſt the Dominion of ſin, and the over-power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of temptation, &amp;c. That we who of our ſelves can do nothing, yet can do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengtheneth us!</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>The Righteouſneſs of Chriſt,</hi> is a good <hi>Oil</hi> or <hi>Ointment.</hi> There is a threefold Righteouſneſs may be conceived in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. 1. <hi>Conſidering him as God;</hi> ſo there was in him an <hi>univerſal rectitude and perfection of nature.</hi> What is eſſentially good, pure and perfect, is the object of Love. <hi>Thy Word is pure</hi> (ſaith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid) therefore doth thy Servant love it.</hi> 2. Conſidering him as <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator,</hi> ſo his <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> was his <hi>Active and Paſſive Obedience:</hi> Whether both be imputed to us for <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> that is another queſtion, as to which I ſhall only ſay this; That the uſual Objection, That his <hi>Active Obedience was but the debt of his humane Nature, which was a Creature, and therefore could not be imputed,</hi> is of no value, for his Righteouſneſs was the <hi>Righteouſneſs and Obedience of a perſon that was God Man,</hi> ſo had a ſurpluſage infinitely beyond the debt of the humane Nature conſidered as a creature. Moſt certain it is, he had a <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> yea and a Righteouſneſs which is reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us for <hi>Righteouſneſs:</hi> his Name is, <hi>The Lord our Righteouſneſs;</hi> and he was made of God for us <hi>Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Sanctification</hi> and <hi>Redemption;</hi> and this is a <hi>ſweet Ointment;</hi> for by this the Soul knows that God hath ſaid to it, <hi>Take away that Soul's filthy garments, and clothe it with a change of garments:</hi> By this it knows, under the utmoſt ſenſe of its own unrighteouſneſs, that it hath a <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> wherein it ſhall <hi>ſtand before God,</hi> and its Sins ſhall be as if they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had been; by this the Soul knows that its imperfect duties, and ſhort performances of the Divine Law ſhall be made up, through the more perfect performance of the Lord Jeſus. 3. There is alſo a <hi>Righteouſneſs of the humane Nature of Chriſt,</hi> which was the confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of his Soul to the whole Will, and Law of God. There is no holy diſpoſition required of any humane Soul, but was to be found in
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:61084:109"/>
the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Holineſs, Meekneſs, Patience, univerſal Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;</hi> now this alſo is a <hi>ſweet ſmelling Ointment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>As theſe diſpoſitions render any Subject lovely,</hi> any creature, though found in it more imperfectly, much more Chriſt in whom they are found moſt eminently. There is none but naturally loves one who behaveth himſelf blameleſly, in whoſe heart we can diſcern <hi>no guile;</hi> one who is in his behaviour humble, meek, lowly, gentle, patient, full of goodneſs; now theſe, and all other excellent Virtues being in Chriſt eminently, make him the excelling Object of our Love: Chriſt was <hi>meek</hi> and lowly, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 29. he was <hi>humble,</hi> condeſcending to thoſe of <hi>low degree.</hi> He made himſelf of no repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 7. Though he was <hi>rich,</hi> yet <hi>for our ſake</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>he became poor.</hi> For his <hi>patience,</hi> he was led as a Lamb <hi>to the Slaughter,</hi> and <hi>as a Sheep before the Shearers, ſo opened he not his mouth.</hi> What ſhould I ſpeak of his readineſs to forgive, his praying to his Father that he would forgive thoſe that crucified him; all theſe made Chriſt an exceeding lovely Object.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But now Chriſt as <hi>Mediator</hi> hath not only theſe excellent ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits as Ornaments for himſelf, but as the <hi>Fountain of Grace,</hi> to diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to us. <hi>Of his fulneſs, we have received Grace for Grace,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh. v.</hi> 16. Theſe are now Chriſt's <hi>good Ointments,</hi> for the ſavour of which the Spiritual <hi>Virgins love him.</hi> And that they may do ſo, it is neceſſary they ſhould <hi>receive the ſavour of them. At the ſavour of thy good Ointments:</hi> So then, they muſt not only caſt a <hi>ſavour,</hi> but the Soul that loveth Chriſt for them, muſt receive the <hi>ſavour</hi> of<note place="margin">4 Qu.</note> them.

               </p>
               <p>Secondly; The Soul receiveth the ſavour of theſe good Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: <hi>By Experience</hi> it hath taſted <hi>how good the Lord is.</hi> What <hi>it bath heard</hi> of God in his Word, it hath ſeen in the <hi>communications of his Grace.</hi> There is no knowledge like to this, and there is no Spiritual Virgin, but hath had leſs or more, ſome experience of the Lord's good Ointments.

In the firſt place, this may inform us of the <hi>Excellency of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> what an adequate Object he is for every Soul to take a delight and pleaſure in? It may be worth your obſervation, how the Language of the Scripture concerning Chriſt, is ſuch as ſeems to court the <hi>humour</hi> of every Soul, to a ſeeking after a propriety and intereſt in him, by ſhewing him to have ſomething in him ſuitable to it, that ſo it might take our hearts off beguiling Objects. Every Sinner naturally ſaith, <hi>Who will ſhew us any good?</hi> Good is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Miſtreſs of the World: Every one courts it. They only differ in their fancies and apprehenſions of what is ſo, and court ſhadows and Chimera's. One ſaith, <hi>Who will ſhew us any good?</hi> That is, ſome way to get a penny. How ſhall we heap up <hi>Silver as the Duſt,</hi> and <hi>Riches as the Sand,</hi> and joyn houſe to houſe, and <hi>field to field,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til there be no room left in the Earth? Come unto me, ſaith Chriſt, I will give you <hi>the Riches of Grace, the Riches of Glory,</hi> Rev. 3. 18. <hi>I counſel thee to buy of me Gold tryed in the fire, that thou mayeſt be rich, and white Rayment that thou mayeſt be clothed, and the ſhame of thy nakedneſs may not appear.</hi> What ſhall it profit thee (ſaith he) to <hi>gain the whole world, and loſe thy own Soul?</hi> Another man he cares not for money, but for his neceſſary uſes; but he <hi>hunts after ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> that is his good; he would be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſome great perſon in the World; he would be led about the Streets, and hear men cry out; <hi>Thus ſhall it be done to the man whom the King delighteth to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</hi> This man now looks upon Silver and Gold but as <hi>white</hi> and <hi>yellow Earth,</hi> and Sand, Idolized a little by a relative value ſome put upon it. He ſnuffs up the Air, and deſires no more than a great Name in the world. Chriſt, to take them off this pitiful purſuit of the Wind and Chaff of the Air, the empty Air of <hi>Court Favour,</hi> or <hi>popular Applauſe,</hi> tells them, he hath <hi>honour</hi> for them. To as many as <hi>receive him,</hi> he <hi>gave a p wer to become the Sons of God.</hi> And if <hi>Sons, then Heirs, Joynt-Heirs with Chriſt.</hi> They ſhall <hi>Reign with him;</hi> They ſhall <hi>judge the World;</hi> They ſhall <hi>be Kings and Prieſts to the moſt High God,</hi> &amp;c. There is a third ſort that crys, <hi>Who will ſhew us any good?</hi> Their good is the <hi>tickling of their Senſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> delicious Fare and Drink for their taſt; fine Rayment for their touch; ſweet Odours for their ſmells; <hi>Muſick</hi> for their Ears, &amp;c. Give them but enough of Wine, and Strong Drink, and Dancings, and dainty Food, coſtly Apparel Perfumes, ſweet Ointments for their Hair, &amp;c. and a few ſuch trifling vanities, which periſh with the uſing, and they have enough, let who will take Silver, and Gold, and Honours, &amp;c.

                  <hi>Angel</hi> you know gave him that Name, <hi>Matth.</hi> 1. and gave alſo the reaſon of it, becauſe he was to ſave his People from their ſins;
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:61084:112"/>
he therefore came into the world, that we might be ſaved from our Enemies, and from the hands of all that hated us. When old <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon</hi> had him in his Arms, he called him <hi>The Lord's Salvation. Jeſus</hi> ſignifies a Saviour. Theſe are ſome of his perſonal Names, every one of which is to the Soul as a ſweet <hi>Oil,</hi> or <hi>Ointment</hi> poured forth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But he hath a ſecond ſort of Names, which are the <hi>Names of Office</hi> given to Chriſt upon the account of ſeveral Offices which he was to bear; and thus he is called Our <hi>Mediator,</hi> Our <hi>Advocate,</hi> Our <hi>King,</hi> Our <hi>High Prieſt,</hi> The <hi>Prophet, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, He is called <hi>Mediator.</hi> It is a name you will find in the New Teſtament given to our bleſſed Lord four times. <hi>One Mediator between God and Man, even the Man Chriſt Jeſus</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle to <hi>Timothy)</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 15. The Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> calls him, <hi>The Mediator of a better Covenant,</hi> Heb 9. 15. <hi>Of the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> Heb. 12. 24.

                  </gap>, one that maketh Peace. A name excellently agreeing to Chriſt, who was <hi>God-Man:</hi> God with us: Neither God only (after his Incarnation) nor meer man. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe being thus <hi>God-Man,</hi> he interpoſeth himſelf betwixt the <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended Creator,</hi> and the <hi>Offending Creature,</hi> and taketh up the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between God and Man. This Name of Chriſt is as an <hi>Ointment,</hi> or Oil poured forth.</p>
               <p>Secondly; He is called our <hi>Intereeſſor,</hi> and <hi>Advocate,</hi> Heb. 7. 25. <hi>He ever liveth to make Interceſſion for us,</hi> Rom. 8. 34. <hi>He maketh Interceſſion for us,</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 1. <hi>If we ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father, even Jeſus Chriſt the Righteous.</hi> The Office of an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate is in a Court to appear, ingage and plead for his Client. Chriſt as an <hi>Advocate</hi> appears in the Court of Heaven for Believers, pleadeth their Cauſe, anſwereth the Accuſations which Satan brings againſt them, interceedeth for them, &amp;c. This is a <hi>ſweet Name.</hi> This is as an Oil poured forth to a Soul conſcious to it ſelf of its manifold failings, and the imperfections of its beſt performances.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, He is called a <hi>King. Pilate</hi> called him ſo in mockery to the Jews, and refuſed to alter the Superſcription of the Croſs which had ſo expreſſed him. God calls him <hi>his King; I will ſet my King</hi>
                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:61084:113"/>
                  <hi>upon my holy Hill of</hi> Sion. He is called ſo not only with regard to his <hi>Eſſential</hi> Kingdom, which he hath as <hi>God over all, bleſſed for ever,</hi> nor <hi>only with reſpect</hi> to his Political <hi>Government of his Church,</hi> which is, or ſhould be every where executed according to his Laws and Preſcripts, but with reſpect to that ſpecial Dominion which he hath over his Saints, by which he doth both ſurpriſe their Enemies, bruiſing Satan under their feet, ſtrengthening them againſt their luſts and corruptions, commanding them into a conformity to his Will, and to the practice and exerciſes of thoſe habits of grace which he hath beſtowed upon them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, He is called our <hi>Prieſt,</hi> our <hi>High Prieſt.</hi> The Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> calls him the <hi>High Prieſt over the Houſe of God.</hi> The High Prieſt of <hi>our Profeſſion,</hi> a great High Prieſt. The Office of the Prieſt was to <hi>enter into the Holieſt,</hi> to <hi>offer Sacrifice for the People,</hi> to <hi>pray</hi> for them, to <hi>bleſs</hi> them. Chriſt did all this: He once <hi>offered up himſelf for us;</hi> he entred into the Holieſt, whither <hi>our forerunner is entred</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle;) we are bleſſed <hi>with all ſpiritual bleſſings in him. He was</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle to the <hi>Galatians,) made a Curſe for us,</hi> that the bleſſing of <hi>Abraham</hi> might come down upon us.</p>
               <p>Fifthly; He is called a <hi>Prophet;</hi> that is alſo his Name: <hi>That Prophet</hi> (by way of Eminency) <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. 3. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 21. <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 23. The woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> perceived <hi>that he was a Prophet,</hi> Joh. 4. 19. He is a <hi>Prophet</hi> not only as he could, and did foretel many things to come, but as he <hi>teacheth and inſtructeth his People.</hi> This he did while he was here upon the Earth, going about, and Preaching in the Temple, in the Synagogues, in the Streets, upon Mountains, &amp;c. but when he aſcended up on <hi>high, he gave gifts unto men;</hi> he made <hi>ſome Apoſtles, ſome Evangeliſts, others Paſtors and Teachers;</hi> for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual building up of his Church; and not only ſo, but by his Spirit inſtructing them in, and revealing to them the deep things of God, the things <hi>which Eye hath not ſeen, nor hath Ear heard, nor can it enter into the heart of man to conceive.</hi> Now all theſe pieces of Chriſt's Name are to the believing Soul as Oil poured forth.</p>
               <p>But beſides theſe perſonal Names of Chriſt, and his Names of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. <hi>Whatever elſe Chriſt is made known by is his Name.</hi> I will mention but three things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>His Word is his Name.</hi> The Goſpel of Chriſt is his Name, that expreſſeth to us what Chriſt is. Chriſt ſaith, that he had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted his <hi>Father's Name</hi> unto the men whom he had given <hi>him out of the world,</hi> Joh. 17. 6. that is his Fathers Truths, the Doctrine
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:61084:113"/>
of his Goſpel. The Lord Jeſus is made known by his Goſpel. That doth the ſame thing for Chriſt, that our Name doth for us; it lets the World know whoſe Son Chriſt is, what he is, what he hath done and ſuffered for Sinners, and this is to the Soul exceeding ſweet, as an Oil that is poured forth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>His Mercy is his Name.</hi> All thoſe declarations of his love and good will towards his Peoples Souls, of which his Goſpel is full. All the Emanations of his Love. When the Lord telleth <hi>Moſes his Name,</hi> he thus proclaimeth it; <hi>The Lord, The Lord merciful, ſlow to anger.</hi> As God gets him a great Name upon <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and the wicked of the Earth, by <hi>executing Juſtice and Judgment;</hi> ſo he gets himſelf a great Name amongſt his Saints, by ſhewing me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cy. His Name is, <hi>I, even I am he that blotteth out tranſgreſſions for my own Names ſake: I will heal your backſlidings, and love you freely.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>His Truth is his Name.</hi> By Truth I mean his <hi>Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in fulfilling his Word.</hi> Thy Truth reacheth unto the Clouds, ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 108. 4. <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 138. 2. reſolveth to <hi>praiſe God's Name, for his Loving-kindneſs and for his Truth.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt is much known to us by his Truth and Faithfulneſs to his Promiſes, making good to his Peoples Souls, what he hath ſaid; hence he is called the <hi>Amen,</hi> the <hi>Faithful;</hi> and the true Witneſs, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 14. <hi>Pareus</hi> (upon that Text) ſaith, that Chriſt is called the <hi>Amen</hi> for that reaſon which the Apoſtle giveth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 19, 20. becauſe he is not <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Nay,</hi> but he is <hi>Yea;</hi> and becauſe all the Promiſes of God in him are Yea and Amen. Thus I have opened to you what that <hi>Name of Chriſt is,</hi> which the Spouſe compareth to an Oil, or to an Ointment poured forth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2 Qu.</hi> But why to an Oil poured forth?</p>
               <p>Certainly for the uſefulneſs of it under that circumſtance. Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Box, Oil incloſed and kept up in the Veſſel, is no way ſo uſeful as when it is poured out. If we uſe it for <hi>food,</hi> it muſt be poured out, if for <hi>Medicine,</hi> if for <hi>Ornament,</hi> which way ſoever we uſe Oil or Ointment, it muſt be poured out, then it becomes uſeful to us. But that which I take to be what is principally intended, is, <hi>Thy Name is exceedingly, infinitely ſweet.</hi> Oil is ſweet in the Veſſel where it is kept; it is ſweet, if but dropped out by drops. But ſaith the Spouſe of Chriſt, <hi>Thy Name is as an Oil or Ointment poured forth.</hi> Thou haſt not only a ſweetneſs and excellency in thy ſelf, but all the grace and mercy in thee is communicated, and that not in drops, or little meaſures, but as <hi>Oil</hi> poured forth, that hath ſcope of Air
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:61084:114"/>
enough to diffuſe it ſelf in and by. If Chriſt had <hi>No Name</hi> by which he could be made known to us, yet there would be in him (as God bleſſed for ever) infinite <hi>goodneſs,</hi> as well as <hi>Majeſty</hi> and Glory; the <hi>fulneſs</hi> of the <hi>God-Head</hi> would be in him, he would be <hi>full of Grace and Truth;</hi> but now his <hi>Name</hi> makes him to be as an Oil poured forth; by that <hi>we behold his glory, the glory as of the begotten of the Father, full of Grace, and Truth,</hi> Joh. 1. 14. When the inviſible, incomprehenſible excellency, love, and grace of Chriſt is made known unto us, either by the Goſpel, or by the emanations of his grace and mercy, or the demonſtrations of his truth, and faithfulneſs, by any of his <hi>perſonal names,</hi> or <hi>names of Office,</hi> w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ich are <hi>given to him,</hi> then like Oil, or <hi>Ointment</hi> poured out, he appears to the Soul tranſcendently, incomparably ſweet. This now appears both from <hi>Scripture,</hi> and from <hi>experience.</hi>
               </p>

From <hi>Scripture;</hi> how ſweet are thy words unto my taſt, faith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 119. 103. <hi>More to be deſired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold, ſweeter alſo than Honey,</hi> and the Hony-comb, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 10. <hi>In his name ſhall the Gentiles truſt,</hi> Mat. 12. 21. <hi>Adam had</hi> a little of Chriſt made known unto him: One promiſe (we read of no more) <hi>The Seed of the Woman ſhall break the Serpents head, Gen.</hi> 3. 15. It was like <hi>Oil poured forth,</hi> and kept him from a <hi>deliquium,</hi> in the ſenſe of the firſt ſin, and his being turned out of Paradiſe; <hi>Abraham</hi> heard a little of Chriſts name, it was to him like Oil <hi>poured forth,</hi> he <hi>ſaw my day, and rejoiced</hi> (ſaith Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 8. he ſaw the <hi>day ſtar ariſe afar off;</hi> he ſaw but the morning, the dawning of the morning too, of Chriſts day, and at a great diſtance how ſweet was it to him? <hi>He ſaw my day</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) and <hi>he rejoiced.</hi> I might give you very many inſtances of the ſweetneſs which the Saints of God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived upon the ſeveral diſcoveries of Chriſt made to them.

               <p n="2">2. I appeal further<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the experience of every Child of God,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:61084:114"/>
even every Soul who hath taſted any thing of Chriſt, and who hath heard any thing of his Name, when a Soul is troubled to think, how often, how heinouſly it hath offended God; how ſweet is the name of a Mediator, when it is brought to a ſenſe of its ſin, and apprehends itſelf loſt and undone, how ſweet is it to remember the name of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> given unto Chriſt, becauſe he was to <hi>ſave his People from their ſins?</hi> when a Soul conſidereth, that without Blood, without a Sacrifice; there is no remiſſion of Sin, how <hi>ſweet</hi> then is the name of an <hi>High</hi> Prieſt over the Houſe of God; who offered up himſelf once for our Sins, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving done ſo, aſcended up into Heaven, and ever ſitteth at the Right Hand of God to make interceſſion for the Sins of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. How ſweet to the Soul that is afraid leſt its luſts ſhould have dominion over him, is the name of Chriſt as a <hi>King,</hi> given unto him, becauſe he is to rule in the hearts of thoſe who are once ſubjected and ſubdued unto him. How ſweet are his <hi>mercy,</hi> his <hi>truth,</hi> his <hi>promiſes,</hi> when at any time the latter are applied to the Soul, and the former any way made known in the Soul?</p>
               <p>Doth any one ask whence it is that the name of Chriſt is ſo ſweet to the Soul? I anſwer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe <hi>it ſignifieth him, to be the fountain of the greateſt ſpiritual good to us;</hi> his name <hi>Meſſiah</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſignify him to be ſeparated, and ſet apart of God for the accompliſhment of the great buſineſs of our Salvation; his name <hi>Emanuel</hi> ſignifies him to have Hypoſtatically united in one Perſon, the Divine, and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, that he might be a fit Mediator, that he might die, and merit ſalvation for us by dying; his name <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſignifies that he is a Saviour; his name <hi>Shiloh</hi> ſpeaketh him to be a Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker, his name of an <hi>Advocate,</hi> ſignifies him to tranſact our buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Heaven for us, his name of <hi>High Prieſt</hi> ſignifies him to have offered for us a propitiatory Sacrifice, to have made an atonement for us, to bleſs us, to interceed for us; the like I might ſay of his other names. Now if the name of a friend, who hath done ſome great kindneſs for us, be oft-times ſweet, like an Oil poured forth unto us, how much ſweeter muſt be his name, by whom we are bleſſed with all Spiritual bleſſings?</p>
               <p>Secondly.

                  <hi>which we can be ſaved,</hi> but only the <hi>name of Jeſus;</hi> do our Souls want any thing? <hi>Whatſoever you ſhall ask in my Name, that I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son,</hi> John 14. 13. <hi>Whatſoever you ſhall ask the Father in my Name, he will give it you,</hi> ch. 16. v. 23. Is the Soul trembling under the ſenſe of its guilt, doth horrour ſurprize it? do the terrors of the Lord diſtract it: a wounded Spirit who can bear? by the diſcovery of the Lord Chriſts name to it, in the Goſpel, promiſes, in the mercy, truth, and faithfulneſs of Chriſt, it is freed from theſe. The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, the leaſt diſcovery of Chriſt to the troubled Soul, is like the Sun beam to the weather beaten and be-wildered Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller, like the ſhadow to him whom the heat maketh faint, like light to him that fitteth in darkneſs, like life to him that fitteth in the ſhadow of death.

                  <hi>In the ſecond place, what an argument is here to perſuade thoſe that hear it to</hi> labour for a diſcovery of Chriſts name to their Souls.

a natural ſweetneſs. I am ſure there is an infinite, a tranſcendent ſweetneſs in the Lord Jeſus. O let the <hi>Virgins love him!</hi> Men and Women that are in a ſtate of Nature, are in one ſenſe <hi>Virgins,</hi> not for purity, but as not married to Chriſt. O do you love Chriſt for the ſavour of his good Ointments! Conſider what a difference there is betwixt this Object of your Loves, and thoſe pitiful Objects which your Souls are ſo hot in the purſuit of. One man's heart is after his Wine, another's after his Riches, a third after the Pride of Life. The Name of theſe things is like the opening of a Dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill, which ſendeth forth a ſtench; they bring up an ill report up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your Souls. Chriſt's Name is like an Ointment poured out.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What an Argument doth this afford to perſuade <hi>troubled, faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Souls,</hi> in their ſpiritual <hi>Swoonings,</hi> and <hi>Deliquiums,</hi> to apply themſelves to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Ludovicus De Ponte</hi> upon my Text telleth us; <hi>Oil is a ſign of Peace,</hi> it <hi>healeth wounds,</hi> it <hi>nouriſheth the weak,</hi> it <hi>feedeth the Candle with light; It exceedeth all Liquors.</hi> Chriſt's Name is as <hi>Oil,</hi> as Oil poured forth; it brings Peace to a diſturbed Soul; it healeth the wounds of a wounded Spirit; it nouriſheth the weak Soul; it exceedeth all created Oil. O meditate upon this excellent Name. There is ſomething healing and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing almoſt in every Name of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Finally,</hi> Let thoſe who have taſted how good the Lord is, <hi>ſtudy Chriſt's Name more;</hi> meditate upon his Name, his Promiſes, his Mercy, Truth and Faithfulneſs more; wear his Name upon your hearts. There is no Chriſtian but is ſubject to its faintings. <hi>David</hi>'s Soul fainted <hi>for the Lord's Salvation,</hi> Pſal. 119 81. But he hopes in the Lord's Word. He had multitudes of perplexing thoughts, but in the midſt of all the <hi>comforts of God refreſhed his Soul.</hi> You that have experienced the ſweetneſs of his Name, ſtudy yet a farther knowledge of him, and acquaintance with him.</p>

               <p>I Have yet ſomething further to diſcourſe to you from this Text. You have heard from it, 1. <hi>That Chriſt hath good Oils, or good Ointments which caſt a ſavour.</hi> 2. <hi>That his Name is as an Oil, or Ointment poured forth.</hi> It followeth, <hi>Therefore do the Virgins love thee.</hi> When I opened the words, I noted to you a double ſenſe of the term <hi>Virgins,</hi> each<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> contrary to the other. Some taking notice of the term <hi>Virgins,</hi> as ſignifying perſons in a ſingle and ſolute ſtate and condition, underſtand by it, <hi>perſons that are natural and unregenerate,</hi> not yet by Faith <hi>married</hi> and <hi>united</hi> to this ſpiritual Bridegroom, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in this Song, who upon the pouring out of the <hi>ſweet Oil</hi> in the Preaching of the Goſpel (which is part of his Name) are invited and allured to take a <hi>complacency</hi> in the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> to deſire him, to will and chuſe him as their Lord and their Saviour. There is a truth in this: <hi>When I ſhall be lifted up</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>I will draw all men after me.</hi> But I do not think this the ſenſe of the term: 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am not willing to interpret <hi>Metaphors</hi> uſed in Scripture into a ſenſe different from all other Texts of Scripture, where the ſame terms are uſed. Now I do not remember that in all Scripture, <hi>Heathens,</hi> Unbelievers, Natural and Unregenerate men are called <hi>Virgins,</hi> but only ſuch as are the Saints and Servants of God. 2.

Neither can the Natural Unregenerate man be ſaid (while ſuch) to <hi>love Chriſt, becauſe of the ſavour of his good Oiutments,</hi> they are conſtantly expreſſed under the notion of ſuch as <hi>hate God,</hi> and <hi>hate Chriſt.</hi> By <hi>Virgins</hi> therefore I then told you the Scripture gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally underſtands the <hi>Saints.</hi> Indeed Profeſſors at large in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,

               <p>

                  </gap>s, <hi>and the pourings out of his Name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, Why are the</hi> Saints of God called Virgins?</p>
               <p>Not becauſe they are not married. The Soul of man will not be alone, it will be united to ſomething; if it be not <hi>united to God and Chriſt,</hi> it will be <hi>united to the world, to luſt and corruption.</hi> I ſay, it will not be alone. The ſame therefore that are here called <hi>Virgins,</hi> are elſewhere called <hi>The Spouſe of Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Bride,</hi> the <hi>Lamb</hi>'s <hi>Wife, &amp;c. Such as are eſpouſed to one Husband.</hi> God faith of them, <hi>I am married to you (ſaith the Lord.)</hi> But they are called Virgins;</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Becauſe they are free from thoſe things to which Vulgar Souls are married, but which are not the proper Husbands of reaſonable Souls.</hi> God hath created man's Soul for himſelf, and its Maker on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can be a <hi>proper Husband for it.</hi> A Soul may be united to other Objects, but they are not juſt Matches, they are not proper Husbands for Immortal Souls, that are Spiritual Subſtances, and under ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations for Eternity. The moſt of Souls are married, but they are <hi>unequally yoked.</hi> For a Spiritual Subſtance to be united to a clod of Earth, to a little yellow Earth or Sand, is a very unequal match. For a Soul to be united to any <hi>ſordid luſt,</hi> any <hi>ſinful pleaſure,</hi> is a very unequal match. The Souls of Voluptuous men, of Covetous world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, of Ambitious men, they are indeed married, they have made a Covenant with their luſts, and with the world, and with theſe things; they eat, they drink, they ſleep, they converſe, they keep a conſtant communion, as the married woman doth, but they are all this while Adulterers and Adultereſſes, becauſe theſe things are not proper matches for the Soul of man; it is like the marriage of a Man to a Beaſt. Now in this reſpect the Saints are <hi>Virgins,</hi> not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed with this adulterous Union; <hi>they have eſcaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 20.
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:61084:117"/>
Hence they are called <hi>undefiled in the way,</hi> Pſal. 119. 1. They are <hi>Virgins</hi> with reſpect to any <hi>Marriage-Union</hi> with the <hi>world,</hi> or any <hi>ſinful luſts,</hi> or any thing which is not a proper match for a <hi>rational</hi> immortal Soul. They indeed live in the world, and uſe the world, but <hi>they uſe it</hi> (according to the Apoſtles Precept) as <hi>if they uſed it not;</hi> they live not with the world, as the Wife lives with her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, delighting in it, looking upon it as their chief Joy and Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; they make uſe of the world, and the things of this world for their lawful occaſions (as the Man may uſe the Woman that is not his Wife) but the world is not that, which their hearts <hi>cleave to,</hi> or <hi>ſet upon,</hi> and in which they take a chief pleaſure and delight. For their luſts and corruptions, they are not free from them, but their hearts are dead to them. Thus they are Virgins with reſpect to their ſtate, which is not a ſtate of abſolute independency from the world, or abſolute freedom from luſts and corruptions, but ſuch a freedom from the one and the other, that they have no conſtant fellowſhip and communion with either.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Their Life is like the <hi>Life of a Virgin, an hidden Life.</hi> The Virgin hath her name in the Hebrew from <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which ſignifieth to hide, becauſe ſhe lived an hidden kind of life. Virgins antiently lay hid in their Fathers houſe, and there they ſpent their time, not in Markets, and Fairs, and places of publick concourſe. <hi>Dinah</hi> made an eſcape, and there was (you know) a ſad conſequent of it. The Virgins life is moſt in her Cloſet, or in her Fathers houſe. Such is the life of a Child of God; they are called God's <hi>hidden ones;</hi> and the Apoſtle ſaith of them, <hi>Our life is hid with Chriſt in God.</hi> The Spiritual Soul ſpends moſt of its time at home, in its Cloſet, or in his Fathers houſe, where two or three are met together in the Lord's Name (this is their Fathers houſe on Earth) or elſe in Heaven. <hi>Our converſation is in Heaven,</hi> Phil. 3. 20. <hi>The world</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>knoweth us not.</hi> The Children of God live, but the World under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands not how they live; <hi>they walk with God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> They live in Chriſt; the life which they live in this ſtate, is by Faith in the Son of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The Life of Virgins is a free Life,</hi> free from that care and ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citude which attendeth the <hi>Houſe-wife.</hi> The Apoſtle telleth us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. <hi>The unmarried woman ſeeketh to pleaſe the Lord, but ſhe that is married ſeeketh to pleaſe her Husband.</hi> The married woman hath upon her a great deal of care and trouble; ſhe hath <hi>an Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,</hi> ſhe <hi>hath Children,</hi> ſhe hath <hi>Servants,</hi> ſhe hath a <hi>Family</hi> to take care for; the Virgin hath nothing to trouble her, nothing to take
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:61084:118"/>
care about, but how to pleaſe her Father, who provideth for her what ſhe hath need of. In this reſpect the Diſciples of Chriſt are Virgins; God hath bidden them <hi>be careful for nothing, but in every<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thing by prayer and Supplications, let your requeſts be made known un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, Philip.</hi> 4. 6. He hath commanded them to caſt their care up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, aſſuring them that he careth for them, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 7. As the Father taketh the care of his <hi>Virgin Daughters</hi> upon himſelf, ſo as they need not be ſollicitous, or trouble themſelves with cares what they ſhould eat, or what they ſhould drink, or what they ſhould put on; ſo hath the Lord taken care for his Children; and every Child of God that walks up to his Principles, and liveth up to his holy Calling, leadeth a life as void of ſollicitous care and anxiety, as the Virgin in her Fathers houſe, whoſe only care is to pleaſe her Father. He is indeed careful to maintain good works but for nothing elſe; and thus as with reſpect to their ſtate, ſo with reſpect to the way and condition of their lives, the Saintsare <hi>Virgins.</hi> But further yet, they are, or ſhould be Virgins, with reſpect to their Qualifications.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Virgins are <hi>chaſt</hi> and <hi>undefiled.</hi> Thus the Children of God are uſually deſcribed in holy Writ. <hi>I have eſpouſed you to one Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, that I may preſent you as a chaſt Virgin to Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 11. 2. They are called <hi>pure in heart, undefiled in the way; they have not defiled their garments,</hi> Rev. 3. 4. Indeed every married woman is not an unclean woman; there is a <hi>marriage-bed undefiled</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) and indeed as there is a matrimonial <hi>Virginity,</hi> or <hi>Chaſtity,</hi> ſo the Saints are ſuch; for though they be Virgins, yet they are <hi>eſpouſed to one Husband;</hi> they are married unto Chriſt. Though their hearts cleave not to Objects which indeed cannot be the proper Husbands of a reaſonable, ſpiritual and immortal Soul.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Finally, <hi>Virgins</hi> are or ſhould be <hi>modeſt in all their behaviour.</hi> She that hath loſt her <hi>Modeſty,</hi> hath expoſed her Virginity to great jealouſies and ſuſpicions. The Children of God are ſo in their hearts, in their diſcourſes, in their hehaviour. But I have opened this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor ſufficiently. Now theſe <hi>Virgins love Chriſt for the ſavor of his Name,</hi> becauſe his Name is an <hi>Oil,</hi> or <hi>Ointment poured forth.</hi> All theſe things are ſpoken in a figure, that figure which we uſually call a Metaphor. Sweet things entice and allure our ſenſes. Sweet ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours are grateful to our ſmell. Thence it is that it hath been an antient practice for Men and Women to uſe ſweet Oil, or Powder, that they might be more amiable and delightful to their Lovers: This you may know was an old practice, by that inſtance of the
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:61084:118"/>
lewd Woman in the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> who to invite the young man to her Adulterous Bed, tells him, <hi>She had perfumed her Bed with Myrrh, Aloes and Cinamon.</hi> The Spouſe making uſe of this vain and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton practice, to expreſs how pleaſant and delightful Chriſt was to her, fancieth him as one perfumed with <hi>ſweet Odours;</hi> anointed with odoriferous Oil, or Ointment. <hi>Thy Name</hi> (ſaith ſhe) <hi>is as an Oil, or Ointment poured forth; Therefore do the Virgins love thee.</hi> That is, thou art poſſeſſed of many noble, rich and excellent habits of <hi>grace,</hi> which make thee to my Soul appear infinitely more ſweet and lovely, than all the good Oils and Perfumes in the World can make one appear to the wanton ſenſe of another; and for thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent graces of the Spirit, by thee not received <hi>by meaſure,</hi> and for the pourings out, and diſcoveries of theſe upon the Souls of the Saints, and the diſcovery of them unto their Souls it is, That Souls freed from the pollutions of the world through luſt: Souls that are holy, ſpiritual, heavenly- minded, deſire after delights, and take an infinite complacency in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. What theſe excellent habits are; what this ſame <hi>unctuous, ſweet-ſmelling Name</hi> of Chriſt is, I have already opened, in my former Diſcourſe. Let me now a little further ſhew you:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu. 2.</hi> What there is in the excellent Graces, or precious Diſcoveries of Chriſt, which make Chriſt ſo amiable to the Soul?</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is in them an <hi>infinite, inexhauſtible, real goodneſs.</hi> All good is attractive. <hi>Who will ſhew us any good,</hi> is, you know, <hi>Vox Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puli;</hi> and it is impoſſible a Soul ſhould apprehend any thing fixedly, as really and tranſcendently good, but it muſt be pleaſing to it. Light is not more grateful to the Eye, than <hi>Good</hi> is to the reaſonable Soul: And as our Eye is proportionably pleaſed with the glimmerings of Light from a Candle, or the counterfeit of it in a <hi>Glow-worm;</hi> ſo the Soul of man falls into the imbracings of good, when it doth but glimmer in a piece of Silver, or diſſemble in a periſhing pleaſure. Nay, we are not altogether ſelfiſh in this motion of our will, which we call <hi>Love:</hi> We naturally <hi>love</hi> what we apprehend good, though we view it but at a diſtance from us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Many a man that hath no Learning, nor is ever like to have it, yet loves Learning, as it hath in it an innate Excellency, as it is an ornament to him that hath it, and makes him more uſeful to the world than his Neighbour. In Chriſt's excelling graces, which dwell in him eminently, and
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:61084:119"/>
eſſentially, there is ſuch a luſtre, and brightneſs, and glory, that to make the Soul take a complacency in him, there needeth no more than that it be enlightened to ſee, know, and underſtand Chriſt. Hence it is that many a Soul convinced of the filthineſs of ſin, and of the fulneſs of that Excellency which is in Chriſt, before ever it have received him, ſo as to apprehend its Intereſt in him, yet <hi>loves,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mireth him, paſſionately deſireth a part and portion in him, ſaith within it ſelf, Oh that my Soul were brought unto Chriſt! Oh that this Chriſt were my Chriſt, my Jeſus, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But there is not only a tranſcendent goodneſs and excellency in Chriſt's Name, but alſo a <hi>Relative Goodneſs.</hi> Our reaſonable Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures force us to love any thing which appeareth to us to be <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Excellent;</hi> but we much more love it, when we diſcover in it a ſuitableneſs to our ſtate and condition; and the more goodneſs and ſuitableneſs we diſcern in any Object in proportion to our ſtate and wants, the more a great deal do our hearts cleave to it, and long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it. Now every Child of God is apprehenſive enough of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion which the Name of Chriſt bears to the wants, the various wants that it hath. It wants a <hi>Mediator,</hi> a <hi>Saviour,</hi> an <hi>Advocate,</hi> an <hi>Interceſſor,</hi> and this that Soul is ſufficiently ſenſible of, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore its heart cleaveth unto Chriſt, and cryeth out, <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee? Or what have I upon the Earth to be compared with thee?</hi> This Soul ſeeth, that there is nothing in Heaven or <hi>Earth</hi> that ſo ſuiteth the Soul of a Child of God as Chriſt doth. Hence his love to him is ſtronger <hi>than the Grave,</hi> and <hi>his jealouſie burns like fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The Virgins muſt needs love Chriſt, upon the diſcoveries of himſelf to their Souls, <hi>becauſe theſe diſcoveries command, and teach the Soul to love him.</hi> Our love to Chriſt proceeds, you ſee, upon ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal grounds, but not wholly upon rational Principles; for we are taught of God (ſaith the Apoſtle) to <hi>love one another;</hi> and if with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a <hi>Divine Teaching</hi> we cannot love our Brethren whom we have ſeen, we ſhall much leſs <hi>love Chriſt,</hi> whom we have not ſeen Indeed this is the firſt cauſe of any love from our carnal hearts to Chriſt at all, it is true. No Sacrifice from our hearts flameth, or can aſcend towards God, until fire hath firſt come down from Heaven and kindled it; when indeed love is thus kindled in the Soul, the fire increaſeth in the Soul; as the apprehenſions of Chriſt's Excellencies, and diſcoveries of himſelf, do increaſe in the Soul from the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences we have of God, or the improvements of our Reaſon upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, to ſhew us more of the Excellency of Chriſt. I come now to the Application.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="229" facs="tcp:61084:119"/>
                  <note place="margin">Uſe 1.</note> In the firſt place, This may convince us, <hi>That even amongſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors there are many that glory in appearance, and not in reality.</hi> They are <hi>no Virgins; they have no love for the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The world it is to be hoped is not ſo full of ſuch as go for <hi>Virgins</hi> in a carnal ſenſe, and are none, as it is of ſuch as go for <hi>Virgins,</hi> in a ſpiritual ſenſe, and are none. <hi>Unmarried</hi> they are, but you muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it only with reference to Chriſt, who is the only proper ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate match for a reaſonable Soul; they are without Chriſt indeed, but not without a-Mate.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Too many are <hi>Whores</hi> inſtead of Virgins. You ſhall in Scripture obſerve, that ſin, eſpecially Apoſtacy, is compared to <hi>Whoredom;</hi> and thoſe that live in ſin, to ſuch as live in Adultery. God of old complained of his People, that he was broken with their whoriſh heart. Ah! how many Profeſſors are there in the world, of whom we may ſay the ſame; God is <hi>broken with their whoriſh heart.</hi> How many ſpots are there in our Aſſemblies? How many of our Virgins that have at leaſt ſuch black ſpots upon their faces, as cannot be allowed to be <hi>the ſpots of God's Children?</hi> Some are gone a <hi>whoring after other Gods. (Reconciled</hi> they call it to the <hi>Church of Rome.)</hi> Oh! tell it not in <hi>Gath,</hi> publiſh it <hi>not in the Tents of Aske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> that <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſhould ever again lick up that Vomit, and be ſo ſottiſh, as to adore a <hi>piece of bread</hi> for God, or fall down before a Graven Image. Bleſſed be God there are not many whom God hath thus given over; I mean, not many <hi>Profeſſors,</hi> though too many that have been baptized into the Name of Jeſus Chriſt. But how many more have defiled themſelves with damnable, or at leaſt very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Opinions? You read of the Daughter of <hi>Jephtah,</hi> that ſhe went up to the Mountains <hi>three months to bewail her Virginity.</hi> The Mountains are places of ſolitude. How were it to be wiſhed for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that they would <hi>go and ſit alone;</hi> that they would go up to the Mountains of Solitude, and bewail the loſs of their Spiritual Virginity. They were ſound Chriſtians (in appearance) but they have loſt their ſoundneſs. They were fond of <hi>Ordinances</hi> and Duties, but they have caſt off Duties and Ordinances. They were of the number of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, as we thought, and we were bound in charity ſo to think (we judged by the outward appearance) but they have defiled themſelves.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Many are wedded,</hi> and <hi>no Virgins.</hi> We do not call married Women Virgins. 'Tis true, they are not ſo in one ſenſe, as the notion of a Virgin ſignifieth a ſolute or ſingle perſon; but yet they may be ſo in another ſenſe, as the notion of a Virgin ſignifieth
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:61084:120"/>
one that is <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>chaſt.</hi> But now, if you can imagine a Woman married to a Beaſt, or married inceſtuouſly, this marriage would ſpoil her <hi>Virginity</hi> in the faireſt notion of it. The Soul married to Chriſt, is yet a Virgin, for ſhe is married but to one Husband, and him the proper Husband for a poor Soul, ſo that that Soul is yet a <hi>Virgin.</hi> But now the <hi>voluptuous</hi> ſenſual Soul, that is united to a baſe and ſordid luſt; or the <hi>covetous worldly Soul,</hi> that is united to the gain and filthy lucre of the world, is no <hi>Virgin,</hi> no more than an <hi>ince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuous Wife</hi> is in any notion a Virgin; and how many of theſe are to be found in the Tents of perſons <hi>profeſſing to Religion!</hi> How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Demas</hi>'s, who have forſaken and forgotten their Religion, and have embraced the preſent World? <hi>Judas</hi>'s, who have betrayed their Maſter and their Brethren for a few pieces of Silver? Surely the Soul, the high-born Soul of man, is of too noble an extract, too ſpiritual a ſubſtance to be united to the Earth. This is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a forbidden Relation. <hi>Love not the world</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>nor the things of the world;</hi> yet never were more to be found amongſt ſuch who are called Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Marriage doth not alwaies <hi>ſpoil Virginity, as it ſignifies Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity:</hi> But an heart <hi>equally cleaving and inclining to two men will;</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if byaſt to him who is not the <hi>Woman's Husband.</hi> She that hath one true and proper Husband, and yet loveth another equally with him, or more than he, hath loſt her <hi>Virgin-heart.</hi> Ah! how many of theſe are there amongſt <hi>Profeſſors?</hi> they are married to Chriſt in the face of the Church; they were baptized into his Name, and are under Vows to be the Lord's: But as God ſaid of old concerning <hi>Ephraim; Their heart is divided, and therefore they muſt be found faulty.</hi> Ah! How many are there that have divided hearts? that halt between two Opinions, and are not able to conclude with themſelves, <hi>whether</hi> Baal <hi>be God, and they ſhould ſerve him; or God be God, and they ſhall ſerve him?</hi> Nay, they halt between <hi>two Converſations;</hi> ſomething there is of Heaven in them, but alas! how much of the Earth? how much of <hi>ſin, folly,</hi> and <hi>vanity?</hi> how much of contradiction to their Profeſſion? <hi>where's a Chriſtian</hi> Caleb <hi>to be found to walk with God fully?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, If we have ſome that are <hi>Virgins,</hi> yet how <hi>few beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Virgins?</hi> where's the beauty, the glory of Profeſſors? where's their former ſhining out before men? Ah! call your Children <hi>Icha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bods;</hi> call them <hi>Ichabods.</hi> The Glory is departed in a great meaſure from <hi>England,</hi> from the Profeſſing Party of <hi>England.</hi> Where's the
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:61084:120"/>
former ſincerity, love to God, zeal for God, plainneſs of heart, ſincerity of converſation, brotherly love, heavenly walking? the World, the vanities of the World, have ſpoiled Profeſſors beauty. The Sun of a little outward proſperity hath ſhone up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, how are they tanned?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Uſe 2.</note> But in the next place this diſcourſe offers us <hi>a fair opportunity to try our Relation to Chriſt,</hi> whether we be the Lambs Wife, who ſhall hereafter follow him whitherſoever he goes. 1. <hi>Are you Spiritual Virgins?</hi> There are tokens of Spiritual as well as Natural Virginity. 1. <hi>Purity, and Chaſtity,</hi> in <hi>heart,</hi> as well as <hi>outward appearance;</hi> Bleſſed are they (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>who are pure in heart, for they ſhall ſee God;</hi> is not thy heart defiled, with ſenſual affections, impetuous paſſions, doth not thy Soul cleave to ſin, and luſt? 2. Doſt thou <hi>live like a Virgin,</hi> an <hi>hidden life?</hi> doth not the world ſee all that thou haſt of a Spiritual life, doſt thou not like the Phariſees, love to pray ſtanding in the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, and in the corners of the Streets, more than with thy doors ſhut about thee, in thy cloſet? liveſt thou any thing of that life which is hid with Chriſt in God? is it thy only and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt care to pleaſe thy heavenly Father, and Chriſt thy great Lord and Maſter? 3. <hi>Where's thy modeſty;</hi> the Virgin bluſheth preſently, when any thing is reflected upon her. Art thou aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med when thou committeſt iniquity, and thy heart reflects it upon thee, or haſt thou a Whores fore-head, that cannot bluſh? I might inſtance in many particulars more, but theſe are enough to try thy Spiritual Virginity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſecond note of the Spouſe of Chriſt ariſing from this Text, is a <hi>love to Chriſt; Love</hi> is a natural plant, and groweth in every Soul, but <hi>love to Chriſt</hi> is a <hi>plant from Heaven,</hi> heavenly, a plant ſprung up from the ſeed of God in the Soul. If Chriſt ſhould from Heaven propo und the fame queſtion to thee, which while he was on Earth he propounded to <hi>Peter,</hi> couldſt thou an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer with him, <hi>Lord! Thou that knoweſt all things, knoweſt that I love thee.</hi> This Grace of all others is moſt diſcernable, for love is of an active nature, and will hardly lie hid. The pantings of thy heart after him, the acquieſcence, complacency, and delight of thy heart in him, will eaſily diſcover it to thee if thou look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt narrowly. The natural man cannot ſay, that his Soul cleaveth to Chriſt, or thirſteth after Chriſt, or taketh any complacency in the Lord Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly. As God is the fountain of good, and bleſſing to his

               <p>Laſtly, Therefore, <hi>Doſt thou love Chriſt for the ſavour of his good Ointments;</hi> becauſe <hi>his name is an Oil, or Ointment poured forth?</hi> He that loveth Chriſt meerly for his Heaven, and Glory, is purely ſelfiſh in his love. I deny not but <hi>Moſes</hi> had an Eye to the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of reward, and ſo hath every honeſt and gracious heart; without doubt Chriſts beneficence, and goodneſs unto us, and the benefit which our Souls have, and hope to have from Chriſt is, and ought to be a very great attractive, and to draw out our hearts more, and more in love to Chriſt, but herein is the purity of the Saints love; he diſcovereth ſuch an excellency in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that were he never to have an Heaven with him, yet his heart would cleave to him, &amp; infinitely delight in him; if thou canſt ſay, that thou thus loveſt the Lord Jeſus, it will indeed ſpeak thee to be a <hi>Spiritual Virgin,</hi> a Spouſe to the Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Uſe 3. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort.</note> I ſhall conclude my diſcourſe upon this verſe with a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold word of Exhortation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the firſt place methinks from this metaphorical expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Saints under the notion of Virgins, I have here a fair opportunity to plead with <hi>Virgins to be Saints;</hi> Virgins (general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) have the object of their love to ſeek; Lo here a moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving object for every young man, every young woman that heareth me. Methinks the holy Spirit points out this in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor <hi>Therefore do the Virgins love thee;</hi> Chriſt here expreſſeth himſelf under the notion of ſome beautiful young man, beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and adorned with all the advantages both of nature, and of art; So that the Virgins muſt love him. I noted to you before that ſome would have the term <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to be rather a term of age, then either ſignifying <hi>Sex</hi> or <hi>State:</hi> oh that I could this day prevail with you who are <hi>young men</hi> and <hi>young women,</hi> to love the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Youth</hi> is an age, a <hi>time of love,</hi> full of love, but it uſually miſpends its ſelf upon vain, and worthleſs objects, the young man loves his luſts, and his pleaſures, the young wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man loveth dancings, and fooliſh ſports, and vain company, and gay and coſtly attire, but how rare is it to find a young man or woman that ſincerely loveth the Lord Jeſus Chriſt? truly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt young or old, there is hardly one of a thouſand, but of
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:61084:121"/>
thoſe that are in the height and heat of their youth hardly one of ten thouſand. It is too frequent for us, to give our mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row to the Devil, and then think to put off God with the bone. O deſperate folly and preſumption! offer this now to thy Prince, will he accept it? canſt thou expect Sinner that Chriſt ſhould freely love thee when thou art grown old, who refuſedſt him when thou wert young? canſt thou reaſonably think that God will be put off with the fag end of thy life, doſt thou not know how hardly an old ſinner is brought to repentance? ſin is bred and ſed in his bones, and it will not out, art thou aware how ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God the ſacrifice of thy youth is? under the old law no Sacrifice was admitted that was above <hi>three years old.</hi> Doſt not thou remember how kindly God accepted his young. <hi>Samuel, Abijam, Joſiah, Timothy,</hi> &amp;c. who in their youth inclined their hearts unto him? doth the good nature and handſome features, and ſweet perfumes of the young man pleaſe thee, and is there no excellency in the Graces of him who is <hi>full of Grace and Truth?</hi> is there no ſavour in Chriſts Ointments? no ſweet Odour from his name poured forth! O come you that are Virgins, behold your Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band! an Husband, who if you be poor, is able to enrich you, if you be mean and baſe, is able to honour, and to ennoble you, who, (what ever you want) is able to ſupply you. O that upon the pouring forth of his name amongſt you in this Sermon this day, ſome of your ſouls this day might be allured to love the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Br. 2.</note> Secondly, This notion obligeth all thoſe that be Saints, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs themſelves ſuch, to approve themſelves to be Virgins, the <hi>holy Spirit</hi> hath ſo called them; certainly it ſhould be their great care to anſwer their name. <hi>To keep themſelves, unſpotted from the world, unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed in the way;</hi> free from the pollution of the world through luſt. I have toldyou that there are many, who go for Virgins, but are not, they are wedded to ſome filthy luſt or other, wedded to the world, defloured by entertainnig ſome corrupt &amp; dangerous prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, or declining to a corrupt converſation; we live in a debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, &amp; a debauching age, you that ſtand, take heed leſt you fall.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1. If you loſe your</hi> Virginity, <hi>you loſe your</hi> honour. <hi>The young Womans Virginity is her honour,</hi> your freedom from idolatry and ſuperſtition; <hi>your</hi> ſoundneſs in the faith, <hi>your purity, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, and holineſs of life is your honour,</hi> Hold faſt that thou haſt <hi>(ſaith Chriſt to the Church of</hi> Philadelphia, <hi>Rev. 3. 11.)</hi> that no man take thy Crown; <hi>he who deſpoileth you of your puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>

It followeth:</hi> Theſe are they which were not defiled with Women, for they are Virgins, theſe are they which follow the Lamb, whitherſoever he goeth, theſe were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed from amongſt men, being the firſt fruits unto God, and to the Lamb, and in their mouth was found no guile, for they are without ſault before the Throne of God; <hi>not defiled with Women.</hi> Non polluti idololatriá, quae eſt ſcortat io ſpiritualis ſed virgines fide &amp; ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu, <hi>(ſaith</hi> Pareus) <hi>not defiled by idolatry, which is a ſpiritual Adultery, but Virgins in</hi> Spirit <hi>and</hi> Faith.</p>

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Conſider, if you loſe your chaſtity. <hi>It will be an hard matter to reconcile you to your firſt Husband.</hi> If the Virgin be known to have loſt her Virginity, it is no eaſy matter to procure her an Husband of any reputation; if the Wife hath loſt her Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity (that is her chaſtity) it is an hard matter to reconcile her to her Husband; <hi>If a man put away his Wife, and ſhe go from him, ſhall he return to her again?</hi> Jer. 3. 1.

O keep your integrity, and behave your ſelves like Virgins, live an <hi>hidden life</hi> more and more to God, and Chriſt, more and more reſerved from the world; learn what this meaneth, <hi>Our life is hid with Chriſt in God.</hi> Be like Virgins, <hi>careful</hi> in nothing, ſave only to pleaſe Chriſt, who is your ſpiritual Husband, let your behaviour ſpeak your Virgin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modeſty; and that you may keep your Virgin State, and beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. 1. <hi>Take heed of Books, that will principle you to a Spiritual Fornication.</hi> There are 2 ſorts of Books in the world, which help much to debauch it. 1. <hi>Amorous Books</hi> full of <hi>laſcivious Songs,</hi> and filthy ſtories. 2. <hi>Heretical Books.</hi> The firſt debauch People as to their bodies: the latter as to their faith and immortal Souls. 2.

Let us ſtudy to be like An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, to get up our hearts to ſuch a ſpiritual pitch as this; to love Chriſt for the excellency of his perſon for the ſavour of his good Ointments.

               <p>I Have told you that the eight firſt Verſes of this Chapter contain <hi>three Petitions,</hi> which the Spouſe (by which we underſtand the Church, or the believing Soul) maketh to her Beloved, the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.

<pb n="236" facs="tcp:61084:123"/>
ments which ſhe uſed to enforce it. I am now come to the ſecond, comprehended in this Verſe, with the Arguments by which ſhe preſſeth it. Her firſt Petition was in thoſe words; <hi>Let him kiſs me <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> the kiſſes of his mouth.</hi> Here ſhe ſaith, <hi>Draw me.</hi> Our Engliſh Annotations make the connexion thus; <hi>Lord, do not only invite and call me, by the Preaching of thy Goſpel (which are the kiſſes of thy mouth)</hi> but command me by the <hi>Power of thy Spirit.</hi> Or thus; <hi>Let me not only be paſſively happy in receiving tokens of love from thee, but make me active in maintaining communion with thee. Let me run af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thee,</hi> and to this purpoſe do thou <hi>draw me.</hi> Thus the coherence of her Petitions ſeemeth to lie. Some there are that do not make this a <hi>new Petition,</hi> but adjoyn the beginning of this Verſe to the latter end of the former, and read it thus; <hi>The Virgins love thee, and have drawn thee after them;</hi> thus the Seventy read it <gap reason="foreign">

And although the Copies of the Seventy, which we have indeed thus read it, yet <hi>Symmachus</hi> and <hi>Aquila,</hi> the two other Antient Greek Tranſlators, read it as we tranſlate it: And I am ſure that is the true Tranſlation of the Hebrew, where the Verb is in the <hi>Imperative Mood,</hi> though there be a little change of the Vowels in regard of the Affix, according to the Rules of Gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians: For <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="2">2. <hi>Running</hi> doth not only ſignify motion, but <hi>ſome ſtrength in the body ſo moving.</hi> The ſick, and feeble perſon can hardly ſtand, or go, much leſs run. The perſon running may want ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of ſtrength, but he muſt <hi>have legs,</hi> and ſome ſtrength in his legs, or he cannot run. The Soul that runneth after Chriſt muſt firſt be poſſeſſed of ſome <hi>Spiritual ſtrength.</hi> The ſtrength of the Soul is an effect of Chriſts drawing. <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith the<note place="margin">Iſ. 55. 2.</note> Prophet) <hi>thou ſhalt call a Nation that thou knoweſt not, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that knew not thee ſhall run unto thee.</hi> Firſt <hi>God calls,</hi> then <hi>we run;</hi> firſt he putteth ſtrength into them, and then they uſe<note place="margin">V.

               <p n="4">4. <hi>Running argues a free and chearful motion.</hi> The man that runs hath, as we ſay, good will in his way; it implies a <hi>prompt inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and readineſs of mind.</hi> Thus <hi>Forſter</hi> (an <hi>Hebrew</hi> Lexicographer)<note place="margin">

Bux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torf</hi> alſo obſerveth its affinity to the latter. <hi>Avendrius</hi> alſo obſerveth, that it ſignifieth to move readily, as the falſe Prophets ran, <hi>Jer.</hi> 12. 5. <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 21. <hi>I have not ſent theſe Prophets, and yet they ran;</hi> as <hi>Gehazi</hi> ran for his <hi>bride,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 5. 20. Thus the believing Soul that is once drawn by the Spirit of Grace, moves in the way of holineſs, not dragged on to duty by a <hi>Foreign Principle:</hi> It is its meat and drink to do the Will of God: It delighteth in the Law of God as to the inward man; it was before unwilling, but now it is made willing, as it is ſaid <hi>My People ſhall be a willing people in the day of</hi>

                  <hi>my power.</hi> Grace giveth wheels to the Soul, and it oileth the wheels when given. <hi>Buxtorf</hi> noteth, that this word is uſed only to ſignifie the running of Men, not of Beaſts. Men move not like Beaſts raſhly and giddily, and meerly when they are whipped on, or out of wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs, but men propoſe and know their end, and move toward it out of a Principle of Reaſon and Affection: The believing Soul knoweth its end, and moveth towards it from a conduct of reaſon; ſo it moveth ſpeedily and freely after Chriſt.</p>

draw others along with her. Yet a little further to enquire the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why ſhe changeth the Number. Doth ſhe promiſe for more than ſhe would pray for? Or doth ſhe envy others that drawing grace which ſhe prayed for for her ſelf? Doubtleſs neither: what then?</p>
               <p n="1">1. Poſſibly <hi>Bernard's notion</hi> may be more acute than ſolid. <hi>We are drawn</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>when we are tempted, when we are afflicted, and exerciſed with tryals, we run when we are refreſhed and comforted.</hi> She would have the <hi>ſowre for her ſelf,</hi> and the <hi>ſweet for others.</hi> She did not know their ſtrength; here was her charity. But I ſay, this ſeemeth too nice; for certain it is, that all who run after Chriſt muſt be firſt drawn one way, or other, and that by power. God's People are <hi>made willing in the day of his power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Beza</hi> therefore ſpeaks better, I think: When ſhe ſaith, <hi>Draw me,</hi> ſhe ſpeaketh in the <hi>perſon of the whole Church,</hi> ſo had a liberty to ſpeak either in the one, or the other Number: So that as <hi>Ludov. de Ponte</hi> hath well obſerv'd, by this change of the Number, ſhe ſhews, that the Church, which conſiſts of many, is yet but One; according to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 5. <hi>We being many are one body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3. By this alteration of the Number, ſhe ſheweth,</hi> That ſhe belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it as eaſie with God to draw many; as one.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Laſtly, Though the Saints be many, yet the end of Chriſt's drawing them is, <hi>That they might be one. John</hi> tells us, <hi>ch.</hi> 11. 52. That the end of Chriſt's <hi>dying</hi> was, <hi>That he might gather together in one the Children of God which were ſcattered abroad.</hi> Thus I have opened the terms.

                  <hi>Into his Chambers.]</hi> The word is often uſed in Scripture, tranſlated a <hi>Chamber,</hi> Gen. 43. 30. Jud. 15. 1. <hi>A Bed-chamber,</hi> 2 Kings 6. 12. <hi>An inward Chamber,</hi> Judg. 3. 24. A <hi>Bridegrooms Chamber,</hi> Joel 2. 16. A <hi>Summer Chamber,</hi> Judg. 3. 24. It is alſo uſed, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24. 4. <hi>Prov.</hi> 7. 27. <hi>Job</hi> 9. 9. and in many other Texts. It plainly ſignifieth, the more inner ſecret, retired part of the houſe, where Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons can be moſt private, and moſt ſecure; <hi>The King hath brought me into his Chambers,</hi> that is, into the places of moſt private ſecret com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him, where I can be moſt private, free, and ſecure; but yet for the clearer explication of the words, we will more ſtrictly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire upon two things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu. 1.</hi> What is here meant by the Kings Chambers.</p>
               <p>Doubtleſs it is ſpoken in a figure. The Houſe in the Heavens, not made with hands, is not (as our Earthly Houſes) divided, into rooms, and ſtories, by partitions; let us therefore rightly comprehend the notion of a <hi>Chamber,</hi> and we ſhall without much difficulty un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the priviledge in which the Spouſe doth glory. Three things will give us the notion of a Chamber.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It is a lofty place:</hi> elevated from the Earth, you know that you or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily call thoſe rooms in your Houſes <hi>Chambers,</hi> which are above the <hi>lower floor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It is a <hi>place of privacy,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">In ipſum penetrale theſaurorum ineffabilium Delrio.</note> any one is admitted into your <hi>lower rooms,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Loca quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam abdita, quietis &amp; refectionis. <hi>Lud. de Ponte</hi>
                  </note> but very familiar friends only into your Chambers, when thoſe of the ſame family would be more retired and private, they chuſe Chambers for that privacy; our more hidden private fellowſhip with our friends, or near relations is in our Chambers.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="247" facs="tcp:61084:128"/>
3. A Chamber is a <hi>reſting place,</hi> we eat, and drink, and have our or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary converſe with our neighbours in other rooms we lie down, and reſt in our Chambers.</p>
               <p>Theſe three things I ſhould think may make us to underſtand the Spouſes meaning in this metaphorical expreſſion, and what it is that ſhe glorieth in.</p>
               <q>The Lord my King hath heard me, and taken me up into the neareſt degrees of cloſe &amp; private communion with him, where my Soul enjoyeth him, in the moſt heavenly, free, and moſt familiar manner.</q>
               <p>Qu. 2. <hi>But how cometh the Spouſe thus ſoon to glory, who but now was praying that the Lord would draw her,</hi> and facitly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained for the want of the manifeſtations of his Divine Grace? how ſoon is her tone altered? ſhe but now groaned, as one that could not get up the Stairs, now ſhe glories that ſhe was brought into the Kings: Chambers. To which I anſwer two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Poſſibly ſhe ſpeaketh but <hi>in the dialect of Faith;</hi> you know the Apoſtle calleth <hi>Faith the Evidence of things not ſeen.</hi> It (like God) <hi>calls the things that are not as if they were,</hi> and often forgets the <hi>future tenſe,</hi> and ſpeaks in the Preſent or Praeterperfect Tenſe. The believing Soul, while it is in the dungeon of a deſertion, being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured the Lord will do it, can ſay; <hi>The Lord hath brought me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Chambers.</hi> And thus thoſe muſt neceſſarily underſtand it, who with <hi>Piſcator,</hi> by the <hi>Chambers</hi> underſtand Heaven, and Glory.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But I rather think the words are to be underſtood as they lie before us: <hi>She is heard while ſhe is ſpeaking;</hi> while ſhe prayeth, <hi>Lord draw me;</hi> ſhe is drawn, and is in Heaven e're ſhe is aware of it; thus the learned <hi>Mercer</hi> expounds it.</p>
               <p>If you underſtand the words in the firſt ſenſe. They ſpeak the vertue and efficacy of faith, the believer by vertue of it, can look upon things as done, which yet are to be done, why? becauſe the Soul eyeth the promiſe, and knoweth, that he who hath promiſed is both able, and faithful. If a debt be owing to you, from an able, and an honeſt man; you ſay it is as good mony as any in your purſe, you count you have ſo much as that debt maketh, addition to your eſtate. Gods hand is an able hand, and he is faithful, the Soul may count upon it, that it hath ſo much either in Grace or glory, as the Lord hath promiſed it. If you take the words in the latter ſenſe (as I ſhall do) they inform you of the <hi>efficacy of Prayer,</hi> ſpiritual, fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:61084:129"/>
prayer, it availeth much; while the believer is ſpeaking, God is anſwering. I proceed to the latter part of the Text.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We will be glad, and rejoice in thee, and remember thy loves more than Wine;</hi> we have heard the Spouſes petition, <hi>Draw me,</hi> ſhe prayed for Divine Grace, that might both ſweetly, and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully <hi>draw her Soul</hi> after Chriſt. We have heard her promiſe, which I told you might be conſidered as an argument to enforce her Petition, an argument drawn from <hi>the glory of God,</hi> and the <hi>concern of it, in the anſwer; we will run after thee.</hi> A prayer for the beſt things, and to receive them for the <hi>beſt end,</hi> to make her more holy. We have heard, how well pleaſing her petition was, ſhe had no ſooner prayed, but God anſwereth, and ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognizeth her anſwer; My Lord <hi>the King</hi> (ſaith ſhe) <hi>hath brought me into his Chambers;</hi> now ſhe cometh to ſhew the <hi>effects</hi> this <hi>quick</hi> and <hi>gracious anſwer</hi> had and would have upon her. She mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth three. The firſt (as ſome if not too critically diſtinguiſh) reſpecting her heart: <hi>We will be glad.</hi> 2. The ſecond <hi>reſpecting the action of the whole man: We will rejoice in thee.</hi> 3. The third <hi>reſpecting the record of it: We will remember thy loves more than Wine.</hi> This now diſtinguiſhed her ſpiritual affection, from a foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh tranſient paſſion.</p>

or jointly I ſhall not determine, and the ſenſe is this. <q>O Lord thou haſt heard my prayer; thou haſt granted the requeſt of my lips, thou haſt brought me into thy Royal Chambers, admitted me to Spiritual, ſecret, and moſt ſweet communion with thee.

                  </gap>2. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 75. 3. If we expound it (as the letter of the Text is) in the abſtract the queſtion will be whether it ſhould be read in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>the Nominative caſe, <hi>uprightneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes love thee,</hi> or in the Ablative, <hi>in uprightneſſes,</hi> they, that is, the <hi>Virgins love thee.</hi> If in the firſt ſenſe, the meaning is this:</p>
               <p>Whatſoever is good, and right, is to be found in thee, all the graces love thee, that is, cleave and are united unto thee. The fulneſs of grace dwelled in him, and all vertues, and graces were made perfect in him. But although this be a truth, yet I do not take it to be the ſenſe of the Text, and in my further diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes on this Song, I ſhall have occaſion once and again to diſcourſe that ſubject.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It may be read in the <hi>Ablative caſe.</hi> In <hi>uprightneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes they love thee;</hi> that is (as <hi>Buxtorf</hi> expounds it) <hi>Rectiſſimè, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titer.</hi> The Saints love thee moſt intirely, ſincerely, ſtrongly,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:61084:130"/>
thus it will afford us this leſſon; <hi>That the Saints love to Chriſt is a moſt ſtrong, ſincere, and entire love.</hi> The Virgins love Chriſt in <hi>upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, not in word, and in tongue only:</hi> but <hi>in deed</hi> and <hi>in truth,</hi> as St. <hi>John</hi> expoundeth it; they love him with a true, and perfect heart. But this will fall in the handling of the Doctrine, which will ariſe from the third ſenſe, which is more generally accepted, and which I ſhall embrace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Therefore I agree with thoſe who think the <hi>Abſtract</hi> is here put for the Concrete; <hi>uprightneſſes,</hi> for the <hi>moſt upright perſons.</hi> The <hi>quality</hi> for the <hi>perſons indued with that excellent quality;</hi> a very ordinary way of ſpeaking in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and indeed moſt langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> No wonder (my beloved!) <hi>that I ſhould love thee,</hi> for there is not an <hi>upright Soul in the world, but loves thee;</hi> and the more there is of uprightneſs in any Soul, the more that Soul loves thee; <hi>Upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes love thee.</hi> Thus now I have largely opened this excellent Text.</p>

               <p>I Come to handle more largely thoſe Propoſitions from this ſecond Petition of the Spouſe, which in my laſt diſcourſe I had no more time, but to name, the firſt of which was this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> Souls muſt firſt be drawn by God before they can come to, or run after the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>I noted to you in my explication of this Petition, that there are two principal uſages of this word <hi>Draw,</hi> in Holy Writ, it ſometimes ſignifieth an <hi>alluring by fair carriage and perſuaſions.</hi> 2. Sometimes <hi>a conſtraining by force and power;</hi> both ways the Lord draweth thoſe Souls that <hi>come to Chriſt,</hi> or that <hi>run after him,</hi> he draweth them <hi>ſuaviter,</hi> and <hi>fortiter, ſweetly,</hi> and yet <hi>powerfully.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. There is a drawing by <hi>Afflictions,</hi> and <hi>Chaſtiſements.</hi> Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are the Lords Cords. If (ſaith <hi>Job,</hi> ch. 36. 8, 9.) they <hi>be bound in Fetters, and be holden in Cords of Affliction. Then he ſheweth them their work, and their tranſgreſſions wherein they have exceeded, he ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth their Ear to diſcipline, and commandeth them that they return from iniquity.</hi> Thus the Lord drew <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> he was <hi>bound by Fetters, and carried into</hi> Babylon, <hi>and when he was in affliction he beſought the Lord his God, and humbled himſelf greatly before the God of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and prayed unto him, and he was entreated of him, and heard his ſupplication,</hi>—It is added <hi>v.</hi> 13. <hi>Then Manaſſes knew that the</hi>

                  <hi>Lord he was God.</hi> I know that <hi>Bernard</hi> thus interpreteth this Text (tho he reſtrains it not to that ſenſe) but I muſt crave leave to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from ſo great a Perſon, not only becauſe I find ſcarce any Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters agreeing with him, but becauſe then the thing here prayed for, muſt be <hi>Afflictions,</hi> which I do not know we are commanded to pray for, and I am ſure nature reſtraineth us in ſuch a Petition; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:61084:131"/>
are afflictions in their own tendency <hi>drawing Cords,</hi> they are rather called <hi>Cords</hi> and <hi>Fetters</hi> to ſignify their <hi>pinching effects,</hi> than that God ordinarily uſeth them to <hi>draw</hi> Souls by unto himſelf; we read of one <hi>Thief</hi> upon the Croſs converted at his laſt hour, and of one <hi>Manaſſes</hi> converted by Feſters, but you have but a ſingle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of each in Holy Writ, and let me further add, <hi>Manaſſes</hi> his affliction was but <hi>Fetters,</hi> and <hi>Impriſonment,</hi> nothing that affected his <hi>head,</hi> and made him unfit to do any thing but to attend the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers of his Body; nor indeed is there any drawing vertue in an <hi>affliction,</hi> it rather naturally alienateth the Soul from God: in my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in the work of the Miniſtry, I have known many good Men and Women bettered by <hi>Affliction;</hi> but I never knew a <hi>bad man or woman,</hi> by affliction brought home to God; it is a fire that ſo ſoftens the wax, and hardeneth the clay, and this agreeth with what we have in Scripture. <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>before he was afflicted he went aſtray, but his affliction had learned him to keep Gods Statutes, Pſal.</hi> 119. But it is ſaid of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> 2 Chron. 28. 22. <hi>In the time of his diſtreſs he treſpaſſed more againſt the Lord; This is that King</hi> Ahaz; and I am ſure the ſame is ſaid of the body of Iſraelites, <hi>Amos</hi> 4. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. God followed them with judgment after judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>yet they returned not unto him.</hi> Afflictions are good remembran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers to them who have learned their duty before, but they muſt be ſome particular afflictions, that give leiſure for <hi>Inſtructions</hi> to be then firſt given, or time for the <hi>digeſtion</hi> of them, if they can be given. I conclude in ſhort, whatever uſe God may ſometimes make of Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it is not the <hi>drawing by them,</hi> which the Spouſe here prays for.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>There is a drawing by liberal diſtributions of mercies of common Providence.</hi> Thus God ſaith, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 11. 4. <hi>I drew them with the Cords of a man, with bands of love,</hi> So Jer. 31. 3. <hi>With loving kindneſs have I drawn thee,</hi> Love is of a <hi>drawing nature,</hi> it is like the hook, in the intrails of a Creature, which draweth more forcibly, than Cords faſtened to the fleſh, and outward part; But experience teacheth us that this is not a ſufficient Cord to draw Sinners Souls to God, God in his parable of the Vineyard, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 5. repeats what he had done for the Iſraelites, and concludes, v. 4. <hi>What could have been done more to my Vineyard that I have not done in it?</hi> Yet when he looked, it <hi>ſhould bring forth Grapes, it brought forth wild Grapes; Oppreſſion</hi> inſtead of <hi>Judgment,</hi> and a <hi>cry</hi> inſtead of <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs?</hi> How many thouſands are there in the world, that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed with Mercies of this nature, they have healthy bodies,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:61084:131"/>
pleaſing relations, full barns, plentiful eſtates, they want nothing, yet are they Enemies to God, and to the Croſs of Chriſt; nor do the People of God, ordinarily run moſt after, or walk moſt cloſe with God, when they moſt abound with the good things of this life. Gods People, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. that <hi>followed him in a Wilderneſs, and in a land of droughts, forſook him when they came into a land that flowed with Milk and Hony;</hi> whence <hi>Agur</hi> prayed as much againſt <hi>Riches,</hi> left he ſhould (being full) blaſpheme God, as againſt <hi>poverty.</hi> And even the man according to Gods own heart, offended more, when he was come to ſit upon his Throne in <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> than when he was hunted like a <hi>Partridge</hi> in the Wilderneſs, and knew not where to reſt, and this is ſeen in our ordinary experience.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>God draweth us</hi> (thirdly) <hi>by the potent arguments of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,</hi> as it <hi>lieth before us to be read, or as it is opened, and applied to us by the Miniſtry of the Word.</hi> Man hath a tunable ear, and is a reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Creature, ſo as arguments have a great force upon humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the more, as any of us are more knowing and rational, and able to raiſe <hi>concluſions</hi> from <hi>Principles.</hi> Into this ſenſe Interpreters do interpret thoſe words of our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 12. 42. <hi>When I ſhall be lifted up, I will draw all men after me,</hi> after my death upon the Croſs, I will ſend my Apoſtles up and down the world, to be witneſſes of my death, reſurrection and aſcenſion, and to perſuade men to receive me in my true notion, as the true <hi>Meſſias</hi> and Saviour of the world. Accordingly the Apoſtle tells the <hi>Corinthians</hi> that Chriſt had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them <hi>the word of Reconciliation. Now then</hi> (ſaith he, 2 Cor. 5. 20.) <hi>We, as Embaſſadours for Chriſt, as tho God did beſeech you by us, we p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ay you in Chriſts ſtead to be reconciled to God;</hi> and this muſt be the meaning of that command to the Servants, <hi>Luke</hi> 14, 23. <hi>Compel them to come in,</hi> Chriſt is not there ſpeaking to <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> or of their duty, but of the duty of <hi>Miniſters,</hi> who have no power from him to <hi>compel</hi> any, but by a lively and powerful <hi>Preaching the Goſpel,</hi> the potent arguments of which ſet home upon reaſonable and ingenuous Souls, by the gifts God hath given to his Miniſters have a kind of compulſory force, and power in them, and the Apoſtle tells us, that <hi>Faith comes by hearing, Rom.</hi> 10. and as men are by it <hi>drawn</hi> to Chriſt; ſo they are alſo by it <hi>drawn after him,</hi> and therefore <hi>Peter</hi> exhorts Chriſtians, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>As new born babes to deſire the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere milk of the Word, that they might grow thereby.</hi> The believing Soul followeth Chriſt, in the <hi>ſcent</hi> or favour of his <hi>precious Ointments.</hi> It is the publiſhing of the Goſpel that makes the name of Chriſt an Ointment poured out.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="254" facs="tcp:61084:132"/>
Fourthly, God may be ſaid to <hi>draw men</hi> by the common <hi>motions of his Spirit,</hi> impreſſing good thoughts upon us, either upon occaſion of his <hi>Providential diſpenſations,</hi> or while we read or hear the word; ſome ſay that there is a common Miniſtration of the Spirit attending the preaching of the word, ſufficient to aſſiſt every Soul that will, to repent, and believe, and to do what God requires of us in order to Salvation; that the holy Spirit doth ordinarily attend the preaching of the word, and ſuggeſt to and imprint upon the hearts of thoſe that hear it, ſome good thoughts, is what will not be denied; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there are but few who have uſed to attend the preaching of the Goſpel, where it hath been faithfully, and livelily preach'd, but muſt own, that he hath heard the Lord ſtanding at his door, and knocking. But ſtill the queſtion is whether this be all the drawing which the Spouſe here begs, No doubt but ſhe begs ſuch a cauſe, ſuch opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a cauſe as ſhould be productive of the effect. The effects are <hi>coming</hi> unto Chriſt, <hi>running after</hi> Chriſt. <hi>Coming</hi> is not expreſly mentioned in this Text, but it is <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 44. <hi>No man cometh unto me, except the Father who hath ſent me, draw him,</hi> and it is included in the term <hi>running.</hi> The <hi>queſtion</hi> therefore muſt be whether ſuch a <hi>drawing</hi> as is by <hi>common mercies,</hi> by the <hi>preaching of the Goſpel,</hi> or by the <hi>common work of the Holy Spirit,</hi> all which reprobates may have, is ſufficient to innable a Soul (yet a ſtranger to God) to come to Chriſt, or to innable any Soul already come to Chriſt, <hi>to run af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him.</hi> I think not, and therefore I conclude in the laſt place;</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>That both in the Souls firſt motions to Chriſt, and its further mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions after him, the Lord putteth forth a powerful influence of his Spirit of grace, beyond the arguments of the word, the ſuaſion of his Miniſter and the common work of the Spirit, attending all faithful preaching of the Goſpel</hi> This I take to be that drawing, the Spouſe here prayeth for and which our Saviour mentions, <hi>John</hi> 6. 44. (as ſome think with an alluſion to the phraſe of this Text) nay ſome bring that Text, <hi>John</hi> 6 44. to prove this Book quoted in the New Teſtament) This I firmly believe, becauſe I am convinced, there is ſuch a work of the Spirit neceſſary, and that both as to the Souls firſt coming to God, and further walking with God, tho as to the latter the Soul be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing renewed, and ſanct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>fied there be a far leſs influence neceſſary than as to the former, yet even after ſanctification, the Apoſtle tells us <hi>that we are kept by the power of God through Faith to Salvation,</hi> and Chriſt tells his Diſciples that <hi>without him,</hi> they <hi>could do nothing,</hi> Joh. 15. 3. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 2 Gal. 20. <hi>I live, yet not I, but Chriſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth</hi>
                  <pb n="255" facs="tcp:61084:132"/>
                  <hi>in me, and</hi> the life which I now live, I live by the faith of the Son of God. But indeed the great queſtion is upon the firſt. <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> will grant <hi>ſpecial grace</hi> to <hi>believers,</hi> but no more than <hi>common grace to all men in aſtate of unbelief.</hi> Let us therefore firſt enquire,</p>

                  <hi>1.</hi> Whither there be not ſomething of a divine power and influence neceſſary to cauſe any Soul to come to Chriſt, beyond the Preaching of the Word, and that common concurrence of the Spirit with the word Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and all the ſuaſions and arguments can be uſed by Miniſters; and of what nature this p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Thoſe who aſſert that there needeth no ſuch act of the divine power, muſt neceſſarily make man a God to himſelf; I mean the Author of the greateſt Spiritual and Eternal good, both in reſpect of action and fruition,</hi> whatſoever is moved, is moved from a <hi>living principle within ſelf,</hi> or from another: Either man is moved to Chriſt as drawn by the Father, or from a <hi>principle of life within himſelf.</hi> I know they will ſay it is from his own <hi>power of willing;</hi> now beſides the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Scriptures, which this is oppoſed to, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 1. <hi>You hath he quickned, who were dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins,</hi> Pſal. 110. 3. <hi>The People ſhall be a willing People in the day of thy Power,</hi> Phil. 2. 13. <hi>For it is God which worketh in you to will, and to do, of his own good pleaſure.</hi> I ſay beſides theſe.

                     </gap>e, faith,</hi> and <hi>new obedience,</hi> which accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this principle are all works proceeding from our ſelves; ſo man is become a Saviour to himſelf by this new Divinity, and the author of the higheſt good to himſelf, and hath nothing to bleſs God for, but only making him a <hi>Man, not a Beaſt,</hi> for being indued with a reaſonable Soul, and living under the Goſpel, he hath a power of
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:61084:133"/>
himſelf to repent, to believe in Chriſt, to do whatſoever Eternal life is promiſed to in the Goſpel, unleſs they will ſay he is beholden to God for the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> annexing eternal life to theſe perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, and accepting ſincerity inſtead of perfect obedience, which yet leaves the regenerate Soul no more to bleſs God for, than the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt and moſt profane Sinner that liveth where the Goſpel is preach'd, for he alſo hath a reaſonable Soul, a will equal with others, there is a covenant of grace equally eſtabliſhed for <hi>Judas</hi> as well as <hi>Peter</hi> (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this Doctrine) One is under the means of Grace, and the common aids and aſſiſtances of the Spirit, as well as the other, for the good inclination of his will to accept the terms of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel which the profane perſon hath not, the regenerate Soul hath no body to thank but himſelf, and to applaud himſelf for the principle of goodneſs, of which it ſeems he is an author to himſelf.</p>
               <p>Secondly. <hi>This Doctrine leaves the Soul ſomething to glory in before God.</hi> The Apoſtle treating of <hi>Juſtification</hi> by faith, in oppoſition to that of <hi>works</hi> argueth thus. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 2. <hi>If</hi> Abraham <hi>were juſtified by works he hath whereof to glory, but not before God.</hi> The Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of that Text which alone in this caſe, I will make uſe of is, That <hi>God hath ſo ordered the cauſes in the Salvation of Man, that man hath no cauſe of glorying before God;</hi> to that purpoſe he ſpeaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 27. <hi>Where is boaſting then? it is excluded;</hi> but admitting that there needed no power, to change the heart, but what is in mans will, <hi>boaſting</hi> is not excluded, a man hath wherein to glory, and that before God; he ſhall ſay Lord! it is true, thou fixedſt an eternal Covenant of Grace, thou madeſt me a man, thou gaveſt me the Goſpel, and the preaching of it, but notwithſtanding all that thou ever didſt for me, I might have gone to Hell as well as a thouſand more, for whom the ſame Covenant was made as well as me, to whom thou gaveſt a Soul of the ſame ſpecies with mine, the ſame Goſpel, the ſame Preaching, the ſame common grace, if I had not had a principle of goodneſs in my own will, of which my ſelf was the cauſe; I had been damn'd, notwithſtanding all thou didſt for me, as many others ſhall be for whom thou didſt as much as for me. Is not here glorying before God? Is boaſting excluded by this Divinity? The main parts here as to mans Salvation are given to a mans ſelf! For I pray ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, a man cannot repent truly, and believe, and obey the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and periſh for ever, now all theſe it ſeems a man may do from himſelf without any act of Divine power, inabling him more than a reprobate to do them, but he may have a common Covenant of
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:61084:133"/>
Grace eſtabliſh'd for him, as well as others, he may have a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Soul, he may have the Goſpel preach'd to him, and the common aids, and aſſiſtances of the Spirit, and yet periſh for ever. So as plainly all that neceſſarily brings Salvation, makes the Soul meet for it, and accompanieth it; all this is from man, nothing is from God, but that, notwithſtanding which, he might have periſhed for ever.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This Doctrine moſt abſurdly aſcribes <hi>unequal vertues to Souls that are equal as to their ſpecies, faculties, and vertues.</hi> All reaſonable Souls are equal, their faculties are the ſame, their vertues and powers the ſame, their Souls are under equal means, motives, aids, aſſiſtances, whence is it, that one mans will is enclined to believe, to receive Chriſt, to obey his laws; the others not? Are not here inequal vertues aſcribed to Souls in all points equal, they are both reaſonable, both have the ſame underſtandings, the ſame wills, the ſame means, the ſame common aids and aſſiſtances. I ask then whence, if not from a mighty powerful influence of God upon one mans Soul, one mans will, more than anothers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> comes it to paſs that the Soul of one is ſoftned, changed, renewed, and not the Soul of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? If it be from a power in the Soul, here is a mighty inequal vertue, aſcribed to one Soul more than to another, of the ſame ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, indued with the ſame powers and faculties, and under the ſame means, aids and aſſiſtances, which is a moſt inaccountable thing.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I ſhall add fourthly, If there be no ſuch <hi>diſtinguiſhing powerful influence of God, making the difference,</hi> the Apoſtle is contradicted, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 7. <hi>Who maketh thee to differ from another? and what haſt thou that thou didſt not receive?</hi> That their Souls are reaſonable Souls that differ one from another in Spiritual things is evident, not only in gifts and endowments, but in ſaving ſpiritual habits, now (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>who maketh thee to differ?</hi> Admit the Apoſtle there, not ſpeaking of ſpiritual ſaving habits, but of <hi>common guifts,</hi> or <hi>extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary gifts,</hi> certainly if it be God who in theſe maketh one Soul to differ from another, it is much more God, who makes a Soul to differ as to ſaving ſpiritual habits, ſuch as make the Soul fit for the Kingdom of God, and accompany ſalvation, but according to this Doctrine man maketh himſelf to differ. God doth no more for the believer than for the unbeliever, for the elect than for the reprobate Soul; ſo he hath not received, but may glory. God is beholden to man for inclining his will to him, he is not beholden to God for inclining his will more than another mans. From hence plainly appears that the <hi>Drawing</hi> here mentioned doth not ſignify the
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:61084:134"/>
meer change of a mans heart or life from a principle within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but a <hi>change</hi> from a <hi>new principle</hi> infuſed from another, from God; and therefore the Spouſe here ſpeaking to her beloved, ſaith, <hi>Draw me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus far now I have evinced that the turning of the Soul from a ſtate, and courſe of Sin, muſt be the <hi>work of God,</hi> and 2. That it muſt be a <hi>ſpecial work,</hi> ſpecial grace, but we have yet further to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the <hi>nature of this great work,</hi> how God draweth the Soul that comes to him.</p>
               <p>This I anſwer in two particulars, 1. It is <hi>For<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Reſiſtance</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth the oppoſition of the patient to the action of the agent; In all reſiſtance there muſt be two parties, whoſe ſtrength muſt be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>equal,</hi> or <hi>inequal.</hi> If it be equal, there is no victory on either ſide. If the Patient be ſtronger than the agent, the agents intended effect is not wrought, but if the power of the <hi>Agent</hi> be greater than that of the Patient, then the Patient is ſubdued and conquered to the will of the Agent. Let us take an inſtance in Phyſick; we will ſuppoſe a <hi>Stomach oppreſſed with wind,</hi> or peccant humors; the Phyſician gives <hi>Phyſick</hi> to expel it, if the power of the wind, or noxious humors be above that of the Phyſick, the Phyſick is inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual, the wind yet rageth, the peccant humors prevail, or increaſe, but if the ſtrength of the Phyſick be more, it expelleth the wind or the peccant humour, though they may firſt make the Perſon ſick, and ſtruggle a great while with the Phyſick; ſuch a reſiſtance as this; may be, and is ordinarily, if not alwaies made to the grace of God; eſpecially to his <hi>common grace.</hi> God calls to the ſinner for repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, faith, new obedience, the Spirit of God concurring with the Preaching of the Goſpel ſtands at the door, and knocks, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 20. The Soul ſaith, how ſhall I leave my ſweet, and pleaſant luſts, my ſenſual or carnal enjoyments. But there is a <hi>reſiſtance</hi> when the ſtrength of the <hi>Patient</hi> is above the <hi>ſtrength</hi> which either the Agent putteth forth, or hath, ſo as all the action of the Agent is fruſtrated, and thus <hi>Grace cannot be reſiſted;</hi> that is, not <hi>finally reſiſted.</hi> It is the will of God to renew, and change the Sinners heart, and who hath reſiſted his will? The Spouſe, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 2. heareth Chriſt knocking at the door of her heart, and ſaying; <hi>Open my Love, my Dove, my Undefiled;</hi> ſhe maketh excuſes, <hi>ſhe had put off her coat, and how ſhould</hi>

                  <hi>ſhe put it on? ſhe had waſhed her feet, and how ſhould ſhe defile them?</hi> Doth the Lord neſt in that anſwer? no; ſee v. 3. <hi>My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door, and my bowels were moved for him.</hi> It is much the ſame caſe with the Soul in its firſt converſion, God calls, invites, perſuades, intreats the Soul to leave its ſinful courſes, and to turn unto God. Saith the poor Creature; I am young, and how ſhall I abandon the luſts of youth, I am ingulphed in a courſe of profitable ſinning; how ſhall I leave my too greedy purſuit of the world, my purſuit of unjuſt gain, &amp;c. Thus it reſiſts a while. But God will not take theſe anſwers, he at length—<hi>puts in his hand by the hole of the door, and opens it. God cannot ſeriouſly act,</hi> and be <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally oppoſed,</hi> for it is certain his power muſt be above the power of the Creature. 2. That he muſt act <hi>powerfully,</hi> appears from hence, in that the <hi>effect is upon the will,</hi> otherwiſe inclined, both by <hi>nature,</hi> and by <hi>cuſtom,</hi> which is a ſecond nature; I ſay the effect is upon the will, a Caſtle too ſtrong for all the power of Hell to ſubdue, the will can be over-ruled by none but him that made it; beſides, this will is otherwiſe inclined. 1. By <hi>nature,</hi> hence we are ſaid to be ſtubborn, ſtiff-necked, to have ſinews of Braſs; he knoweth nothing of the heart of man by nature, that knoweth not that it is averſe to God. Add to this, that cuſtom hath the force of a <hi>ſecond nature; how can you</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>that are accuſtomed to do evil, do well?</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a powerful operation can ſubdue, ſuch a mighty <hi>Prince</hi> as the will of man is, nor ſuch a mighty Tyrant as cuſtom is. As to the point of reſiſting grace, we ſay;</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is a common, praecedent exciting grace, this may be <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,</hi> as the <hi>Phariſees rejected the counſel of God againſt themſelves, for their own Salvation;</hi> thus all reprobates living under the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel, reſiſt the grace of God; they have an enmity to the Spirit of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 6. and <hi>cannot be ſubject to it,</hi> hence it is, that God ſo often complains, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. 14. <hi>I ſpeak to you riſing up ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and lying down late, and you have not heard,</hi> Pſal. 81. 14. <hi>I call'd you, and you have not anſwered;</hi> Chriſt told the Inhabitants of <hi>Hier<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, that he would have gathered them, but they would not.</hi> And hence appears that it is no wonder that <hi>Arminians</hi> who will allow none but common grace before converſion, ſhould contend, that it may be <hi>finally reſiſted,</hi> for there is no doubt but all <hi>common grace</hi> may be finally reſiſted.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But ſecondly, We ſay there is a <hi>working, drawing grace,</hi> which may be for a while oppoſed, but cannot be <hi>finally reſiſted.</hi> By this the

Soul is <hi>regenerate,</hi> and <hi>born again,</hi> and that not after the <hi>will of the fleſh,</hi> or the <hi>will of Man, but the will of God.</hi> This we ſay cannot be <hi>finally reſiſted;</hi> the reaſons are:</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> Becauſe by this God gives a new heart, and a new ſpirit, and cauſeth the Soul to walk in his ſtatutes, <hi>as you will find,</hi> Jer. <hi>31. 18.</hi> ch. <hi>36.</hi> v, <hi>26. Now grace cannot be reſiſted but from an old heart, and indeed it is a contradiction, to ſay God may be reſiſted by a new heart. 2.</hi> Again if this grace might finally be reſiſted, the whole buſineſs of mans Salvation, muſt depend upon his own goed nature, and the power of his own will, <hi>and the proximate cauſe of a mans repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, faith, holineſs, muſt be in himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, We ſay there is a <hi>co-working Grace,</hi> by which (as <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> ſaith) being firſt drawn <hi>we move,</hi> being acted, we act; this is that grace, which God followeth converted Souls with, that Grace, which followeth the Child of God, all the days of his life, <hi>without which he can do nothing, Job.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Hence is the <hi>ſpiritual combate;</hi> the luſtings of the fleſh againſt the Spirit. Yet this is but a partial reſiſtance, not from the whole of the regenerate Soul, but from the <hi>fleſh</hi> in it, which luſteth againſt the Spirit, from that part which is yet unregenerate. Nor ſhall this reſiſtance be victorious, but the ſame Soul that crieth out. <hi>O wretched man, who ſhall deliver me from this body of Death?</hi> ſhall in the next words ſay, <hi>I thank God through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Thus I have ſhewed you how God in the drawing of a Soul to Chriſt worketh powerfully.</p>
               <p>But 2dly, As he works powerfully, ſo he works <hi>ſweetly,</hi> powerfully, ſo that he will be obeyed <hi>ſweetly,</hi> ſo that he is <hi>freely obeyed,</hi> the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a ſinner is an act of <hi>power,</hi> but not of <hi>violence;</hi> the myſtery of this lieth here: Becauſe the <hi>effect of grace</hi> is upon the <hi>will of man.</hi> Violence is then offered to us, when we are compelled to actions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to our wills. The will is not indeed capable of violence; the will may be <hi>changed, renewed, otherwiſe inclined,</hi> but <hi>not forced,</hi> force can only be offered to the outward man, and why thoſe who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for a power in man, ſo renew, change, alter, otherwiſe incline his own will, ſhould find a difficulty to allow God, as much power as they claim for man, who is but a creature, I cannot underſtand: Thus far I have ſhewed you that a Soul muſt be drawn before it

The Apoſtle ſpeaking of the weak Brother, ſaith,</hi> God is able to make him to ſtand. <hi>We ſtand</hi> in grace, <hi>Rom. 5. 3.

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. In the firſt place the Scripturé ſpeaketh of the <hi>Children of God in this life as in a ſtate of imperfection.</hi> Not (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>as though we were perfect, or had already attained,</hi> Phil. 3. 12. To have no further need of Grace, ſpeaketh a <hi>ſelf-ſufficiency,</hi> and a <hi>ſtate of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi> which is every where in holy writ denyed to man in this life, nothing needs be added to that man who ſtands in no need of the power and aſſiſtance of Divine Grace, but the holy Scripture every where ſpeaketh of the ſtate of man while on this ſide Heaven, as a ſtate in which ſomething is lacking to him, &amp; of Heaven only, as that ſtate, wherein <hi>juſt Souls are made perfect:</hi> wherein <hi>that which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſhall be come, and that which is in part ſhall be done away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>As the Child of God before he comes to Chriſt is in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture repreſented in a ſtate of death,</hi> Eph. 2. 1. You hath he quickned, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 1. <hi>Who were dead in treſpaſſes and ſins; So when come to Chriſt, it repreſents him in a ſtate of weakneſs,</hi> Ro. 5. 6. <hi>When we were yet without ſtrength,</hi> Chriſt <hi>died</hi> for us. Not only <hi>life</hi> but <hi>ſtrength,</hi> was a piece of the purchaſe of Chriſt for us. Chriſt ſaith as to his Sheep, <hi>John</hi> 10. 10. <hi>I am come that they might have life, and that they may have it more abundantly.</hi> The Children of God are all as <hi>Mephibo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth,</hi> the Sons of <hi>Jonathan,</hi> and ſo beloved of <hi>David,</hi> united to

Chriſt, and ſo beloved of God, and muſt eat bread at his Table, but they are all of them (like him) <hi>lame of their Feet.</hi> Now thoſe that are <hi>without ſtrength cannot run;</hi> running doth not only require life as the principle of motion, but ſtrength alſo to aſſiſt the motion; what the Apoſtle ſaith of their knowledge, and prophecying they <hi>know in part,</hi> and <hi>prophecy in part,</hi> is as true concerning all their other graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous habits and acts, they are all but in part, they are in this like <hi>Nebuchadnezzars Image,</hi> part of <hi>Iron,</hi> and part of <hi>Clay. Adam</hi> indeed had both his legs, a full ſtrength, and could of himſelf (without any need of the aſſiſtance of a Mediator) have done all that God required of him in that ſtate, as neceſſary to his Salvation, but he fell, and did not only for his poſterity, as well as for himſelf, loſe his innocency, and righteouſneſs, but his ſpiritual ſtrength, and ability alſo.

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>That body of death which remains in the beſt of Gods Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, evinceth a neceſſity of a continued powerful influence of grace to keep the Soul in any motion, eſpecially in any quickneſs of motion after God.</hi> That we have weights that preſsus down, a ſin which eaſily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets us, a <hi>body of death</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls it, proper lufts, luſtings of the fleſh againſt the Spirit, is evident in holy writ; we are indeed at laſt more than conquerours over this inteftine adverſary, but it is through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. For luſt is ſo connatural to us, the luſtings of the fleſh ſo ſtrong in us, that our regenerate part could never elſe maintain the Spiritual fight. Beſides (as I ſhall ſhew you) as we have an impotency, ſo as we cannot ſo much as will the thing which is good, ſo we have alſo a natural dulneſs and averſion to it, and this alſo remaineth in part in the regenerate Soul, nor to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered without the influence of the holy Spirit.</p>

from its <hi>grand adverſary</hi> the <hi>Devil,</hi> and alſo from the <hi>world.</hi> I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs I have met with one, &amp; never but one, that would pretend to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>a power in man to reſiſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the ſtrongeſt Temptations</hi> without any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary aſſiſtance of the Spirit of grace, this he would impoſe upon the world to believe, becauſe that <hi>Joſeph</hi> reſiſted the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from his Miſtriſs. That <hi>Joſeph</hi> did reſiſt that temptation, is plain in Scripture; but that he did it, by no further aſſiſtance of Grace, than <hi>Reuben</hi> had, who defiled his Fathers Bed, or <hi>Abſolom</hi> who went in to his Fathers Concubines, will want better proof than any I find in his diſcourſe. I cannot but think that if man (without the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of ſpecial grace) <hi>had a power</hi> (as he boldly ſaith) to reſiſt <hi>the ſtrongeſt temptations;</hi> we ſhould have none deſtroy themſelves upon temptations to ſelf murder, <hi>Atbeiſtical thoughts,</hi> and <hi>Deſpair.</hi> It is an inaccountable thing why any ſhould deſtroy themſelves if this Doctrine were true, eſpecially if they be perſons not before poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt of atheiſtical principles, believing there is neither God, nor De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, Heaven or Hell; who can give an account (ſuppoſe it in the power of the beſt of <hi>men to reſiſt the ſtrongeſt temptations</hi> without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>ſpecial grace)</hi> how <hi>David</hi> (the man according to Gods own heart) came to fall into the ſin, firſt of <hi>Adultery,</hi> then of <hi>Murther? To will</hi> was certainly preſent with him, (as well as with <hi>Paul)</hi> how came he to want a <hi>ſtrength to perform,</hi> but from Gods withdrawing his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial influence of grace from him, and leaving him to his own ſtrength, which (though, the ſtrength of a renewed man) yet is too little to grapple with a ſtrong temptation. If even the beſt of men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the powerful influence of <hi>ſpecial grace,</hi> can reſiſt ſtrong tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, how came <hi>Peter</hi> to fall by denying his Maſter by ſwearing and curſing that he did not know him? he manifeſted that <hi>to will was preſent with him,</hi> by his telling our Saviour that <hi>altho all men ſhould forſake him, yet he would not.</hi> God was pleaſed to with-hold his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful influence, and to leave <hi>Peter</hi> to the ordinary ſtrength even of a renewed man, he was not able to grapple with the temptation. It is ſo far from being true, that man <hi>hath a power to reſiſt the ſtrongeſt temptations,</hi> that without <hi>Chriſts influence aſſiſting,</hi> he hath not a power to reſiſt <hi>any temptation,</hi> whether from the <hi>World,</hi> the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> or the <hi>Devil.</hi> It is <hi>Muſculus</hi> his obſervation upon <hi>John</hi> 15. 3, Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour doth not fay without me you cannot do much, or all, but you can do nothing. Nor if it be a <hi>ſtrong temptation</hi> (ſuch as the <hi>fear of life</hi> &amp;c.) can a Chriſtian reſiſt and overcome it without a more than ordinary aſſiſtance of <hi>Divine Grace</hi> proportioned to the degree of
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:61084:137"/>
                  <hi>temptation.</hi> But vain <hi>man would be wiſe, though he be but as an Aſſes Colt</hi> he would be <hi>ſtrong,</hi> though in very deed he is weaker than water, he would be all to himſelf, though he be nothing in himſelf.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But for a further proof of this <hi>Propoſition</hi> concerning the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of <hi>drawing, powerful influences of Divine Grace,</hi> both with reference to the Souls firſt <hi>motions</hi> and <hi>coming to Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>further motions,</hi> in following Chriſt, and running after him, I ſhall but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the experience of all <hi>converted</hi> Souls. If there be an heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me which God hath truly changed, any one that is not only converted from one opinion to another, or one profeſſion to another, from <hi>Paganiſm</hi> to <hi>Chriſtianity:</hi> but indeed converted from the <hi>love of ſin,</hi> and <hi>luſts,</hi> to the love of God, and the hatred of all ſin, and an endeavour to walk cloſe with God, from an opinion and confidence of, and in any righteouſneſs in itſelf, wherein it can hope to ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to a <hi>truſting</hi> and relying on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs! I appeal to that Soul, what was it, thinkeſt thou, that inclined thy heart to accept of Jeſus Chriſt for thy Saviour, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit all the concerns of thy Soul unto him, and to alter thy courſe of life from a principle of love to God, and obedience to his will, more than anothers, who ſate in the ſame Seat with thee, or lived in the ſame Houſe, and ſate under the ſame Miniſtry, heard the ſame Sermons? how cameſt thou to be taken, thy Neighbour left? how came thy will to <hi>move regularly,</hi> whiles thy Neighbour under the ſame circumſtances ſtill retained his ſtiff neck, and iron ſinews, and hard heart, and continued in the ſame lewd and ſinful courſes? who made thee to differ? Didſt thou make thy ſelf to differ? How came it that he did not alſo make himſelf to differ? I know there is no Soul, whoſe heart is truly changed, but will ſay, if almighty power had not changed me, I had been as bad as any other. And ſo ſince thy Soul hath been changed, thou haſt met with <hi>Temptations</hi> to ſin, thou haſt reſiſted them, overcome them, triumphed over them; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (poſſibly ſome very good men) have fallen by, and under them, who again hath here made thee to differ? No pious Soul that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands itſelf, but will here cry out <hi>Grace, Grace,</hi> powerful diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Grace. So as this Doctrine is conſonant to the experience, and judgment of the beſt of men, the other contrary to their expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience and reaſon, and therefore not like to prevail much in the world with any who either underſtand what grace and holineſs is, nor what the ſtate of man is ſince the fall.

               <p>
                  <q>That God when he calleth them by his Goſpel, giveth to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, not only neceſſary, but ſufficient Grace, for faith and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and ſeriouſly commandeth them to believe and obey, under
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:61084:138"/>
the promiſe of eternal life if they do theſe things, and the contrary threatning of eternal death if they do not. This calling they ſay is in Scripture called an Election unto Grace differing from that unto gloty and Eternal Salvation. This calling is effected, and perfected, by the Preaching of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and the vertue of the Spirit conjoined with it, and that with a gracious, and ſerious intention (on Gods part) of<note place="margin">Confeſſ. Rem. cap. 17.</note> working faith in all thoſe who are ſo called, whether they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and be ſaved in the iſſue, or pertinaciouſly refuſe faith, and eternal Salvation; for they tell us there is an effectual calling ſo called, rather from the event, than from the intention of God, properly ſo called, which calling obtaineth its ſaving effect, not from any preciſe intention of God to ſave men, or becauſe it is ſo made by the ſecret and ſingular wiſdom of God, that it effectually agreeth with the will of him that is called, or becauſe in, and by it the will of him who is called, is ſo determined to faith, by an irreſiſtible, and an almighty power (not leſs than that of Creation, or raiſing the dead) that it cannot but believe, and obey, but becauſe man doth not put in a bar (which he might do) to the call of God, nor reſiſt Divine Grace. They tell us there is another ſufficient grace which is ineffectual, which through a failure on mans part, hath not a ſaving effect, but is unfruitful, and obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not its due, and deſired effect, only through mans voluntary and vincible fault;</q> Hence they will tell you, that they attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute all to Grace, they make that the beginning, the reaſon of the progreſs, and perfection of all good, ſo that without preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, exciting, following, and co-operating grace, the regenerate man himſelf, can neither will, nor do any good, nor reſiſt any temptation.</p>
               <p>But they mean by Grace, nothing <hi>but the means of grace, and ſuch an aſſiſtance of the holy Spirit,</hi> as alwaies attends it, and one as well as another hath, that ſits under the Goſpel; for that which we call <hi>ſpecial grace</hi> or <hi>diſtinguiſhing grace</hi> (the <hi>drawing</hi> of the text) by which God powerfully influenceth the Souls of ſome, not of others, and worketh faith and diſpoſitions to new obedience in them, they deny any ſuch thing, and ſo <hi>attribute to the will of man,</hi> all the change of the heart which we call con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion or regeneration; hence they will tell you, that God never ſo worketh in any Soul, but man may hinder, and finally reſiſt

his operations. This is their opinion, which how contrary it is to truth, and how abſurd it is, I have ſhewed you in my former diſcourſe; what <hi>Bradwardin</hi> ſaith of the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied<note place="margin">Bradwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din de cauſa Dei l. 1. cap. 38.</note> to theſe Teachers. <q>They make God <hi>pauperculum Merca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torem,</hi> like a poor Pedlar, that indeed carries about his Grace, and perſuades men to receive it:</q> But man is made the <hi>buyer.</hi> Thus (ſaith that grave Author) God ſhould rather, <hi>gratiam ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am commutare ac vendere, quam dare;</hi> commute and ſell his grace rather than beſtow, and give it.

They will tell us they will grant this; That God is the firſt cauſe, and mover as to all good, and that all this is of his grace, but he moves us only, by external calling, and the common aſſiſtance of his Spirit.

Again how is the converſion of a ſinner from the <hi>Grace of God,</hi> whoſe Grace it ſeems extends no further before converſion, to the perſon to be converted, than to the perſon that ſtill continues in its hardneſs, and inconverted ſtate, ſo as it is not the <hi>Grace of God</hi> that cauſeth the Soul to <hi>differ,</hi> for as to that, there is no difference, the ſame adminiſtration of grace, both to thoſe whoſe hearts are changed, and to thoſe whoſe hearts are not changed.

I appeal to any whoſe heart God hath changed, whether they think their hearts, had ever been turned to God if this had been all God had done for them, that is, given them his Goſpel, and by that invited them to turn unto him, nor can it be ſuppoſed, that when an all-knowing, all wiſe God, from all Eternity, had a <hi>certain infallible knowledge, who ſhould be eternally ſaved,</hi> and of the powers, and inclinations of all mens hearts, that he ſhould leave the means in order to this ſalvation ſo imperfectly willed, that it was left poſſible, that by thoſe means, none ſhould ever be ſaved, and obtain what he certainly fore knew, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fore-know becauſe he had willed it.

The preſent time alone is thine, and but a little of that neither, that which (as <hi>Gerard</hi> ſpeaks) <hi>dicendo praeterit, currendo praeterlabitur,</hi> is gone while thou ſpeakeſt of it, ſlipt away while thou thinkeſt of it. What talkeſt thou of to morrow, of the next week, month, year, who haſt not an inch of time at thy command, nor canſt command thy Sun to go back, or to ſtand ſtill for an hour?

What if he will ſay unto thee, Thou dilatory fool! This night thy Soul ſhall be taken from thee, this year, this month thou ſhalt die. O the moſt unrea ſonable vanity of men in venturing Eternity upon ſuch incertain contingencies! yet this is the uſual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> confeſſeth, that his foot was once in this ſnare; he reſiſted motions for his turning to God, with <hi>cras, cras,</hi> to morrow, to morrow, I will do it, till at length through the power of grace he brake the ſnare, crying out, <hi>Cras Domine! cur non hodie?</hi> to morrow Lord, and why to morrow? why not to day? This is but the firſt thing I would ſay to theſe procraſtinating Souls, and not that which properly reſulteth from my former Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But though there be an obvious contingency in that, yet we may admit that thou ſhalt live unto the time thou haſt prefixed to thy ſelf for thy coming, and returning unto God, <hi>ſuppoſing yet that no man cometh to the Son, unleſs the Father draweth, how vain are the promiſes that thou makeſt to thy ſelf?</hi> Admit thou doſt live to that time, and that before that time thy heart ſhall not be more inamoured upon thy luſts, and hardened in thy ſinful courſes, but that then thou ſhalt have as good and fair convictions as now thou haſt: Yet art thou ſure that God will then <hi>draw thee?</hi> Art thou ſure thou ſhalt then be drawn <hi>by the Preaching of the Goſpel?</hi> Admit that, Art thou ſure of the motions, impreſſions, and <hi>breathings</hi> of the holy Spirit of God? The Preaching of the Goſpel beareth the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the healing of the Soul, that the <hi>Pool of Betheſda</hi> bare to the <hi>healing of bodily infirmities.</hi> Men might lie there many <hi>years;</hi> the Goſpel tells you of one that lay 36 years, yet was not healed; the Angel indeed came often down and ſtirred the waters, but none
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:61084:142"/>
thruſt him in. There is an healing virtue in the Goſpel; it is the word of Reconciliation, the word of the Kingdom. The Spirit of the Lord attends the miniſtration of it, it ſtirreth the Pool; but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit this, if there be none to help the poor Soul that is impotent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, it is not healed. What knoweſt thou whether the holy Spirit which breatheth where it liſteth, will breathe upon thee at thy lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure? God ſaid of the Old World, <hi>My Spirit ſhall not alwaies ſtrive with man.</hi> If it be not perfectly in thy own power to turn to God when thou pleaſeſt, it is the moſt unaccountable folly imaginable, for any to reſiſt the holy Spirit, and to vex it; yet promiſing himſelf the operations and effects of it, when he will be pleaſed to call for, and to admit them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But I hear ſome ſaying,</hi> Do not you determine that the grace of God cannot be reſiſted, what need your exhortations then not to reſiſt it?</p>
               <p n="1">1. I have told you that the grace of God may be oppoſed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, but that Grace by which the heart is changed, is powerful, and finally cannot be reſiſted; but certainly the common grace of God (which the Apoſtle ſaith hath appeared to all men) may be <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed</hi> and <hi>reſiſted,</hi> and finally rejected, and is ſo by the moſt of thoſe that ſit under it; and certain it is, that mens oppoſing and reſiſting of that common grace, may provoke him to deny <hi>ſpecial grace</hi> to the Soul that doth it, and will juſtifie God in the denial of it. For we have no reaſon to complain of God's not doing what was truly and purely his part, whiles we have not done what is our part, and in our power. Now, though the change of the heart be an act of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power, yet acts of moral Diſcipline, and the avoiding groſs and ſcandalous ſins, and the performance of ſome religious Duties, which God hath preſcribed as means (though not in themſelves ſufficient and effectual) are things within our power, with the aſſiſtance only of that common grace, which God denieth to none to whom he doth not deny the Goſpel: And in theſe the holy Spirit may be oppoſed, and finally reſiſted, though he ſhall not be finally reſiſted by any Soul that is ordained to life and eternal Salvation; and it is certainly the duty, and wiſdom of every Soul, to take heed of this <hi>Reſiſting,</hi> this <hi>Vexing the holy Spirit,</hi> becauſe, as I ſaid before, God ſhall for ever be juſtified in the with-holding his gracious acts of power, until man hath done what is in his power. To which I think I may add, that in the day of Judgment, there will be wanting a Preſident ſo much as of one Soul, who hath followed the <hi>drawings of his Goſpel,</hi> ſo far as he had power; to whom God hath denied the more <hi>powerful</hi>
                  <pb n="275" facs="tcp:61084:142"/>
                  <hi>drawings of his Spirit, making a change in the Soul, and ſubduing it to the obedience of Faith;</hi> and alſo becauſe God will not have his Spirit alwaies ſtrive with man, becauſe he is but fleſh.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But ſecondly, Even the People of God alſo fall under this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, though not for ſuch vexings, and reſiſtings of the Spirit, as natural, and unregenerate men are guilty of, yet for <hi>Quenching the Spirit in its motions, and reſiſtances</hi> of it in his <hi>operations,</hi> whence the Apoſtle ſaw need of thoſe Precepts, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 19. &amp; <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 30. We are prone, 1. <hi>To Quench the Spirit</hi> in its motions to duty, and to put them off. 2. <hi>And to promiſe our ſelves, if we fall, we ſhall riſe again.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When we find ſome motions to duty, which we have reaſon to conclude to be from the holy Spirit dwelling in us, and ſometimes from ſome more than ordinary ſuggeſtions to, and impreſſions made upon us, we are too ready to put them off to ſome other time, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing to our ſelves that we then will obey them, and hearken to them, not conſidering, that as our firſt coming to Chriſt dependeth upon the Father's drawing; ſo our running after him depends upon <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s, and <hi>his Spirit's drawing.</hi> Now, though the Lord never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaketh the Soul that is his, as to neceſſary grace; yet he often deſerts it as to gradual manifeſtations, in ſtrengthening, and quickening in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences. See that famous inſtance, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. The Lord called at the door of his Spouſe, ſaying, <hi>Open my Love, my Dove, my Undefiled.</hi> The Spouſe grieveth her Beloved's Spirit; ſhe would open in the morning, when ſhe ſhould have had her fill of ſleep; when ſhe ſhould be up and dreſt, <hi>ſhe had put off her Coat, and how ſhould ſhe put it on? ſhe had waſhed her feet, and how ſhould ſhe defile them?</hi> At length <hi>v.</hi> 5. She roſe <hi>to open to her Beloved, but he had withdrawn himſelf, and was gone,—She ſought him, but ſhe could not find him; ſhe called him, but he gave her no anſwer.</hi> It is the caſe of many good and <hi>pious</hi> Soul. The holy Spirit moves it to ſome evident piece of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual duty; (for I am not ſpeaking for extravagant impulſes to things no where preſcribed, or directed in the Word of God) the Soul is under ſome ſpiritual <hi>Torpor,</hi> and liſtleſneſs; it agrees the thing ought to be done, and diſputes nothing but the neceſſity of doing it preſently, it neglecteth it; it may be when it would open to its Beloved, it finds that he hath withdrawn himſelf, and is gone. It ſeeketh him, but it cannot find him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, We are as prone alſo vainly to think within our ſelves, <hi>If we ſin, we will repent, if we fall, we will riſe. Or, though</hi>
                  <pb n="276" facs="tcp:61084:143"/>
                  <hi>we run into temptation, yet we will not fall by it.</hi> All this while for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting, that although <hi>we live,</hi> yet <hi>it is not we,</hi> but <hi>Chriſt lives in us,</hi> and we ſhall ſtand in need of <hi>drawing</hi> grace to run after God. It is true, that if the Believer ſinneth, he hath <hi>an Advocate with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, even Jeſus Chriſt the Righteous.</hi> If <hi>he falls, he ſhall riſe.</hi> God will <hi>ſuccour him when he is tempted;</hi> but all this proceeds from an influence forreign to him. God is able to make him to ſtand, and <hi>faithful,</hi> ſo as he <hi>ſhall ſtand.</hi> But yet his own endeavours are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to his ſtanding, and Divine Grace is neceſſary (if he be lapſed) to his recovery; and though he may know, if he knows that he is Elected, and effectually called, and juſtified, that he ſhall not periſh for ever; yet this can by no means encourage his preſumptuous ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; for theſe two Reaſons: 1. <hi>Becauſe while he lies under the guilt of ſin not repented of, he can have no knowledge of his Election, or Effectual Calling,</hi> but hath reaſon to ſuſpect he hath all this while miſtaken the caſe and ſtate of his own Soul. 2. <hi>Becauſe he may be ſaved as through fire, and go with an aking conſcience even to the gate of the City of God.</hi> Now it is impoſſible, that in the Judgment of any Soul under the conduct and command of reaſon, the pleaſure of ſin ſhould appear compenſative of the rack of Conſcience, and the feeling the terrours of God upon the Soul but for a few days. If in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed man having fallen from his integrity, had a power to riſe again at pleaſure by the help alone of his own hands, he might have from hence a motive to indulge his corruptions; but if he hath no ſuch power, but what he derives from drawing grace, certainly it is the vaineſt thing imaginable for man to ſin upon a preſumption, of what is not in his power; and though he be certain of it in the iſſue, yet he may want it ſo long, as may leave him little pleaſure of his ſinning, little fruit of thoſe things for which he hath been ſo long aſhamed.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Uſe 3.</note> Thirdly, From this repreſentation of the ſtate, the preſent ſtate of Man; <hi>We may obſerve the difference betwixt our preſent ſtate, and the ſtate of our Pro-parent</hi> Adam <hi>in the ſtate of Innocency.</hi> It is a point not half enough thought of, and the want of a due conſideration of it, cauſeth ſo many ſwellings againſt, and blaſphemings of the Truth of God in this point. They will not underſtand, that although <hi>God made Man upright,</hi> and in <hi>Honour,</hi> yet he <hi>abode not in Honour,</hi> but by ſeeking out inventions, became like unto the Beaſt that periſheth. The ſtate of Man at firſt was ſuch,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That he needed not have come to Chriſt for life;</hi> he had his li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e in his hands. There needed no Saviour before we were loſt, no
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:61084:143"/>
Mediator or Interceſſor, before man had offended, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, no applications of our Souls unto him for life and Salvation, and this by the way may ſhew you the weakneſs of their reply, who when they are told, that it is no more injuſtice with God to call to us for thoſe exerciſes of Grace in order to our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which in our lapſed ſtate we have no power to perform, than it is in man to call to him, to whom he hath lent a great ſum, which he by his debauchery hath ſpent, to pay him what he oweth him, and to lay him in Priſon (though he hath nothing to pay) for God in creation gave unto man a power to do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever in that ſtate was neceſſary to his Salvation. I ſay when they are told this, they uſually tell us, That <hi>Adam</hi> never had a <hi>power to repent and believe in Chriſt;</hi> Nor was <hi>repentance or faith in Chriſt</hi> neceſſary in that ſtate wherein <hi>Adam</hi> was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, nor would it ever have been neceſſary either to him, or us, had he ſtood in that eſtate, God gave unto <hi>Adam</hi> and to us in him, whatſoever was neceſſary in that ſtate, and if our Fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, and we (who dyed in him, and fell with him) have made a <hi>Mediator</hi> neceſſary, and repentance, and <hi>faith</hi> in the Mediator neceſſary, and we have no power to theſe acts, nor ever had, no not in <hi>Adam,</hi> how yet is God unrighteous in requiring thoſe acts of us, though we have no power to perform them?</p>
               <p>Secondly, As in that ſtate, there was no need of a Chriſt, of a Saviour, a Redeemer, nor conſequently of a being drawn, or a coming to him: <hi>So neither was there need of any ſuch potent drawing in order to our running after him. Adam</hi> had a perfect power connatural to him, to walk with God in the obedience of his will. It was the fall that lamed us in our feet, and introduced this neceſſity of Chriſts drawings in order to our running. Let us in a word or two take a view of man now in this, that he ſtands in need of theſe divine drawings.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He now ſtands in need of a <hi>Mediator,</hi> and there is no name given under Heaven by which any Soul can be ſaved, but <hi>only the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, no Salvation by any other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. He ſtands in need of <hi>drawing to this Mediator,</hi> not only of a Child to be born a Son again, a Saviour prepared, but of the work of the Father, and the holy Spirit to draw us to, and after this Mediator.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Drawing</hi> (as I have ſhewed you) imports a fair treating, &amp; intreating, &amp; alluring Souls to what is their great and only happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:61084:144"/>
this ſpeaks man, 1. <hi>In a ſtate of averſion from God</hi> and his only felicity. Mans ſupreme happineſs lies in his union, and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God, as the ſupreme and greateſt good; yet he muſt be <hi>drawn</hi> to it, drawn with the cords of a man, allured by mans Rhetorick, perſuaded to it by mans <hi>Logick,</hi> and ratiocination; we as the Embaſſadours of Chriſt, muſt beſeech and intreat men to be happy in being reconciled to God, and thus much is gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us by thoſe who make themeaneſt, and moſt jejune inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of this drawing.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Uſe 4.</note> This may inform us in the true nature of <hi>ſpecial ſaving Grace.</hi> It is a <hi>drawing</hi> to, and <hi>after Chriſt. Grace</hi> in its general notion ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth nothing but <hi>free love and favour.</hi> Let me find <hi>grace,</hi> or I have found <hi>grace,</hi> ſignifies no more in Scripture, than though I have <hi>no worth, no merit,</hi> yet ſhew me love and favour; when ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to God, it ſignifieth no more in the <hi>general notion,</hi> whether this love be ſhewed in the collation of the good things which concern this life, or thoſe which concern that life which is to come, they are all <hi>grace</hi> in a large ſenſe, becauſe <hi>emanations</hi> of divine <hi>love,</hi> not merited by Creatures. But words taking their <hi>ſignificancy</hi> more from uſe than <hi>etymology, Grace</hi> in a more ſtrict and uſual notion hath been taken to <hi>ſignify,</hi> The <hi>emanations of Divine love concerning the Souls, and Eternal Salvation of the Children of men,</hi> which is called the <hi>Grace of God</hi> which <hi>bringeth Salvation.</hi> Now theſe divine <hi>emanations</hi> having different effects, this <hi>Grace</hi> of God is alſo diſtinguiſhed into <hi>Common</hi> and ſpecial, <hi>ineffectual,</hi> and <hi>effectual;</hi> under the notion of <hi>common grace,</hi> we comprehend all thoſe effluxes of divine goodneſs, by which God ſheweth his kindneſs to the Souls of men in order to their Salvation, whether they prove effective of their Salvation, yea or no; under this head, ſome will bring both <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,</hi> owning no other <hi>Election,</hi> than the eternal counſel of God to ſave ſuch as ſhould believe, ſo denying all eternal <hi>Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of perſons,</hi> and making <hi>Chriſts intention in dying</hi> to extend to all, either equally, or at leaſt ſo far as to put all in a poſſibility of Salvation, if their own perverſe wills do not hinder. The <hi>Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> and <hi>propoſal</hi> of the Goſpel, with the common influences of the Spirit attending the preaching of it, certainly come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this notion, for though all hear not that joyful ſound, yet it is granted on all hands, that of thoſe that do hear it, to ſome it is the ſavour of life unto life, to others the ſavour of death unto death. And this is all the <hi>grace</hi> which ſome will <hi>acknowledge,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent to the <hi>pardon of ſins,</hi> and <hi>regeneration.</hi> But we affirm a further <hi>ſpecial grace</hi> than this is, which we call <hi>ſpecial,</hi> becauſe it is not equally adminiſtred to all, no not to all that <hi>hear the Goſpel, ſaving,</hi> becauſe it brings <hi>ſalvation,</hi> not only in a general <hi>tender,</hi> and offer unto all, but to that <hi>particular Soul,</hi> upon whom it ſhineth, and ſo is <hi>effectual,</hi> becauſe <hi>effective</hi> of the bleſſed end to which it is levelled, and aimed, and doth not <hi>evaporate</hi> in a meer <hi>tender,</hi> and <hi>propoſal</hi> of the <hi>will of God.</hi> This is that which
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:61084:145"/>
we conceive expreſſed here, and in <hi>John</hi> 6. 44. under the notion of <hi>drawing.</hi> Which term is fully expreſſive of the Nature of it, as it ſignifieth both, 1. <hi>An act of power.</hi> 2. <hi>An act of ſweetneſs and love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>An act of power.</hi> The converted Soul is made willing in the day of the <hi>Lords power, Pſal.</hi> 110. 3, 4. The holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture deſcribes us in our natural ſtate, as dead in <hi>treſpaſſes</hi> and <hi>ſins,</hi> Eph. 2. 1. <hi>Enemies to God,</hi> Col. 1. 21. and <hi>alienated from the life of God.</hi> Having <hi>hearts,</hi> harder then <hi>rocks,</hi> then <hi>nether milſtones, iron ſinews, ſtiff necks.</hi> Let thoſe that think, a meer <hi>intreaty</hi> of a Soul to come to Chriſt, that it might have life, a meer <hi>moral ſuaſion,</hi> or perſuading a Soul to Spiritual duty, will change it, and renew it, and beget in it ſpiritual habits, try what their Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick will do, to melt a rock, or to raiſe a dead body. If the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage of an ill education, and a cuſtomary courſe of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery, added to our vitiated nature, hath ſuch a power to beget in us a <hi>moral impotency,</hi> that the <hi>drunkard,</hi> and the <hi>unclean</hi> perſon cannot obtain of himſelf, notwithſtanding the advantage of his own ratiocination, and the potent arguments drawn from the health of his body, the upholding his reputation amongſt men, the preſervation of his eſtate, the pleaſing of his ſober friends, to turn from an Alehouſe, and Tavern, and from the houſe of the ſtrange Woman, no not tho his own experience, and the daily experience of others, verifieth theſe arguments; and the acts are but ſuch, as by the force of reaſon (ſuppoſing the common grace of God denied to none) may be declined. How ſhall we ever think, that a man hath a natural power to the moſt <hi>ſublime</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual acts,</hi> and that the <hi>power of God</hi> muſt not be put forth upon a Soul, cauſing it to <hi>love God,</hi> and to <hi>hate ſin,</hi> and to <hi>believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Two things evince <hi>this grace</hi> to be an act of divine power.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The inviſibility of Chriſt and his excellencies.</hi> 2. <hi>The natural alienation of our Souls from him;</hi> If indeed our need of Chriſt, or the ſuitableneſs which is in him to the lapſed ſtate of Souls, were either evident to ſenſe, or demonſtrable to reaſon, or the excellencies of Chriſt were demonſtrable to either; ſomething might be ſaid for the ſufficiency of rational arguments to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade the Soul to Chriſt, yet not enough in that caſe, for the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of the goodneſs of <hi>temperance,</hi> and <hi>ſobriety</hi> and <hi>chaſtity,</hi> their ſuitableneſs to the frail ſtate of our bodies, ready to be
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:61084:145"/>
deſtroyed by debaucheries oppoſite to theſe vertuous habits, we ſee by experience, are not enough to keep Souls within the circle and bounds of morality. But the other things being nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſubject to the demonſtration of ſenſe or reaſon, it is moſt ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational to plead for a power in the will of man to chuſe them. The ſweetneſs of what the lapſed Soul in its ſtate of alienation from God taſteth in ſenſible ſatisfactions, is a thing evident to ſenſe, and it is moſt abſurd to imagine, that a Soul ſhould ever call theſe things bitter, till it be convinced of a more excellent good, and the incompetency of its fruition both of the one and of the other. Could it be any thing leſs than a powerful act of Divine Grace, that could make <hi>Moſes</hi> willing, to refuſe the <hi>pleaſures</hi> of <hi>Pharaohs Court, and the honour of being called his Son, and to chuſe rather to ſuffer affliction with the people of God, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the reproach of Chriſt, greater riches then the Treaſures of</hi> Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt? O ſtudy, and adore the power of <hi>faving</hi> and <hi>effectual Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace.</hi> Do but conſider your own weakneſs, and the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty power of Satan in tempting, and you will be convinced, that there had need be a divine power exerted, in the collation of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But yet as it is <hi>mighty</hi> and <hi>powerful,</hi> ſo it is alſo ſweet; we are <hi>drawn to Chriſt,</hi> but it is with the cords of a man, the <hi>divine power</hi> put forth, hath the <hi>will for the object,</hi> which is not <hi>forced,</hi> but melted, <hi>renewed,</hi> changed by the influence of the mighty God upon it. Indeed the <hi>will</hi> is not capable of <hi>violence,</hi> but yet it is capable of a <hi>divine influence</hi> ſweetly <hi>renewing,</hi> and changing it, the Soul is made willing, and then it <hi>wills,</hi> and chuſeth, deſires, delights in the things which are good, and acceptable in the ſight of God. <hi>Grace</hi> doth not meerly exhibit, and propoſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> as a lovely, and beautiful object, <hi>altogether deſires,</hi> it doth not only furniſh the Goſpel, and fill the mouths of Miniſters with ſuaſive arguments, but it fills the Soul, the inward man with a powerful divine influence, which quite reneweth and changeth it, and altereth the byaſs and inclination of it. This is the nature of ſaving grace, effectual grace, thus it differs from that Grace of God which may ſhine upon reprobates, which they may final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſiſt, and abide ſtill in darkneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Uſe 5.</note> This notion in the next place wonderfully commendeth the love of God, to thoſe Souls that are made partakers of this Grace of God that bringeth Salvation, that maketh <hi>a Soul meet</hi>

                  <hi>for the inheritance of the Saints in light.</hi> The great boaſt which thoſe who maintain the contrary ſyſteme of Doctrine to what I have maintained, make, is, that their Doctrine doth <hi>vaſtly more commend the love of God to mankind.</hi> Let us try that a little; According to their Notion of the <hi>Grace of God,</hi> it is no more, than might have been conſiſtent with the <hi>Eternal perdition of all mankind;</hi> for they ſay God hath determined no particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon unto eternal life, Chriſt hath laid down a price no more for the Soul that is ſaved, than for thoſe that periſh. In the Acts of his Providence he doth no more for one than another. Both have the Goſpel, both have the common aſſiſtances of the Spirit, and one hath no more than another, both have Souls of the ſame <hi>ſpecies,</hi> indued with the ſame faculties, both might have reſiſted the Grace of God, and that finally. Now do not theſe mightily magnify Grace, who will allow no more of it then what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the eternal deſtruction of all men? yet neither are they conſiſtent to themſelves in their doctrine of <hi>Grace,</hi> ſo far as they will allow any thing to it, they pretend the advancement of the love of God, by their <hi>conditional Election, incertain Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, univerſal Redemption, common Grace,</hi> yet they cannot deny, but that the far greater part of the world hath not ſo much as the means of grace, the ſound of the Goſpel is not in their Ears; and how little of it is there in Popiſh Countries, where the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have not the Bible in their own language, and hear ſtories, and tales out of the <hi>Legends</hi> inſtead of the Goſpel? nay, in Proteſtant Countries how many places are there, where People have Stones inſtead of Bread, Scorpions inſtead of Fiſhes, where they from the Pulpit hear little of Chriſt, or the great motives of the Goſpel to faith and holineſs? ſo as to make out their notion of their Doctrines, commending the love of God; they muſt find out a way to Chriſt and Salvation, for more than three parts of the world, without Chriſt, and that an ordinary way too, (or but few of them will be ſaved) yet in this extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, that their Salvation muſt be without the Goſpel, and the potent motives and arguments of it, the Preaching of it, and the ordinary concurrence of the Holy Spirit with it. The opinion of Divine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> on the other ſide is this; That God out of the Maſs of Mankind (whether conſidered as created, or to be created, they are not ſo univerſally agreed) did chuſe a certain number of Perſons great in itſelf, but ſmall in compariſon of the
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:61084:146"/>
whole number of mankind, as to whom he willed a Kingdom of life and glory: and alſo choſe them and ordained them to obtain this life, by having Redemption through the Blood of Chriſt, the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſins, and by being holy and unblameable before him, and to this end ſent his Son to die for them, and gives to the moſt of them, whom he thus ordained to life, and to faith, and holineſs, as the means of it, his Goſpel, and the Miniſtry of it, by which he intreateth all thoſe to whom it is Preached, to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to God; but for thoſe whom he hath ordained to life, he powerfully and effectually worketh in them by the Spirit of his Grace, by which their hearts (though they may for a time oppoſe and reſiſt) yet are ſubdued to the obedience of faith, and drawn un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, and by which alſo being come to Chriſt, they are <hi>drawn</hi> after him, being by his power through faith preſerved to Salvation. Now whether is the Love of God more ſeen to mankind in the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Salvation of many, (though comparatively but few) and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of cauſes accordingly: Or in ſuch an ordering of cauſes, as it was poſſible notwithſtanding any thing God had done for man, all might have periſhed: And whether is God more glorified by our predication of him, as one, who though from all eternity he knew who would believe and live holily, and who would not; yet left it poſſible that all men ſhould believe if they would. Or by the predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of him, as one who knowing all things, becauſe he willed them (ſo being the firſt cauſe of all good in the creature) ordered all things according to the good pleaſure of his own will. In the mean time this <hi>Drawing Grace</hi> which we maintain, infinitely commendeth the Love of God to thoſe who are thus drawn, if we conſider</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The infinite diſtance of God from the creature:</hi> He is a ſelf-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency to himſelf, and in order to his happineſs needed not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of any creatures: Now if there were no more in <hi>drawing grace</hi> than ſome would make, drawing with the <hi>Cords of a Man,</hi> intreating and perſuading Souls to be reconciled to God, his love might be juſt matter of admiration and aſtoniſhment: Who are we that God ſhould treat us, and ſend Embaſſadors to intreat us to be reconciled unto God? If the Lord had only ſent to us to give us warning of a wrath to come, and timely notice to flee from it, leaving us meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to our own <hi>wills,</hi> whether we would hear, or forbear, accept, or refuſe. This had been love above the uſual mercy of men, who do not uſually ſpend much time in treating, and intreating thoſe enemies whom they can eaſily cruſh, and tread under foot. Yet had God
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:61084:147"/>
done no more for our Souls, though in this he had ſhewed great love, yet we through the natural ſtubborneſs, and perverſeneſs of our hearts, had been undone for ever. How many are in a high Road to ruine and eternal deſtruction, whom God hath been thus intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and beſeeching many years?</p>
               <p n="2">2. But now that the Lord ſhould not only do this, but <hi>put forth an act of power,</hi> though not ſaving them againſt their wills, yet making them <hi>willing to be ſaved,</hi> and in order to it not verbally, but really willing to receive Chriſt as tendred to them in the Goſpel, ſo as not only to be ſaved by him, but to ſubmit to thoſe Laws and Rules, in the obſervance of which they ſhall obtain Salvation; and not only ſo, but that God ſhould aſſiſt the Soul in the performance of theſe acts; not only giving it to will, but to do alſo. This certainly muſt tranſcendently commend the love and goodneſs of God to thoſe Souls that have experienced ſuch grace. That God doth not ſo much for all, ſpeaks indeed <hi>ſeverity</hi> to them, but that he doth it for any, ſpeaks his unſpeakable goodneſs and good will to their Souls. I ſay, that he doth not this for all, ſpeaks to them <hi>ſeverity,</hi> but yet <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,</hi> and that not only in regard of that ſtock of <hi>ſufficient grace,</hi> wherewith our Pro-parent was intruſted, which being loſt, God is under no obligation to reſtore: but alſo in regard that God never denieth his <hi>ſpecial Grace,</hi> until the Soul hath abuſed his <hi>common Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Nay laſtly, That the <hi>Lord ſhould take care of our Souls</hi> after that we are once <hi>brought to Chriſt,</hi> that he ſhould put <hi>his fear into our hearts,</hi> to keep us from <hi>departing from him,</hi> and never depart from us to do us good, that <hi>drawing Grace</hi> ſhould follow us all the days of our life. This certainly is the heighth of Divine Love, more than this God could not have done for any Soul; thoſe for whom he hath done this, muſt be <hi>highly beloved.</hi> What now is left for ſuch a Soul to do, but to ſtrive after perfection? to live in a conſtant eying this All-ſufficient God, this Fountain of all Fulneſs, and living in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon him: To live in a continual thankſgiving to, and love for that God who hath dealt thus graciouſly with it, and in a daily care not to grieve that holy Spirit by which it was firſt drawn to Chriſt, and by which it is ſealed to the day of Redemption, and guided and kept, that it doth not ſlip fatally. O love you the Lord all ye his Saints! Let <hi>drawing Grace</hi> find no <hi>renitency,</hi> no <hi>reſiſtance</hi> from any of your Souls. God hath done for you more than others; what will you do for God? nay, what can you do for that God,

who hath not only called, but pluckt you out of the horrible Pit? Take the Cup of Salvation, and be for ever praiſing the Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Uſe 6.</note> Again, we may from hence learn, though not the <hi>proximate,</hi> yet <hi>a true and remoter cauſe why the Goſpel is preached</hi> to many ſo <hi>inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually.</hi> Our Saviour tells us, <hi>Many are called, but few are choſen Iſaiah</hi> cried out, <hi>Who hath believed our report? to whom is the Arm of the Lord revealed? Paul</hi> in his Preaching was to ſome, the <hi>ſavour of life unto life;</hi> to others, the <hi>ſavour of death unto death.</hi> When Chriſt himſelf Preached ſome <hi>believed,</hi> others were <hi>hardened.</hi> Whence ſo great a difference, when the Word was the ſame, the Preachers the ſame, both to thoſe that believed, &amp; to thoſe who were hardened: They had all reaſonable Souls; thoſe Souls had all the ſame powers, the ſame faculties; I mean, powers and faculties that had the ſame virtues. We ſee the ſame in the experience of every day. Indeed there may be ſome Preaching, that may bear no better proportion, to the inſtruction of the ignorant, or the conviction of a ſinner, and turning him from his ſinful courſes, than the <hi>Clay and Spittle</hi> had to cure the blind man's eyes, from which no ſuch effect could have flowed, but by a miracle; but where there is the ſame <hi>Scriptural,</hi> ſpiritual, lively, powerful Preaching, we ſee this effect. Two ſit in the ſame ſeat, one's heart is changed, the other's is not; one goes on in his leud courſes, and periſheth for ever, the other is converted, his heart changed; whence is this difference? Is it from him that <hi>willeth,</hi> or <hi>him that runneth</hi> (think you) or <hi>from him that calleth? from him that ſheweth mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> becauſe, and on whom <hi>he will ſhew mercy?</hi> We will grant that the one doth not make that uſe of God's <hi>common Grace</hi> which he might, and therefore the Lord righteouſly with-holds his <hi>ſpecial Grace.</hi> But could not the Lord, if he pleaſed, influence the one Soul as well as the other, to make a good uſe of his common Grace? Hath God (think we) no influence upon men, inclining their hearts to make a due uſe of his common Grace? When men have ſaid what they can, the converſion of every Soul is the effect of the Lord's drawing; and when the Lord doth not draw, the Soul doth not, cannot, come or run. The natural man hath many things which draw him another way, and God is not pleaſed to put forth his power upon the Soul. Indeed properly nothing but our own luſts draw us another way, but our natural paſſions are inflamed ſeveral waies. You have an inſtance of the principal of them in the Parable of the Marriage-Feaſt which the King made for his Son, recorded by <hi>Luke, c.</hi> 14. 18, 19, 20. &amp; <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. <hi>v.</hi> 5, &amp;c. <hi>A certain great</hi>

It is the command of God, that <hi>In the ſweat of our Face we ſhould eat our Bread.</hi> Ah! But if the Cart draws to the Market, when God calls to the Solemn Aſſemblies of his People, the five yoke of Oxen prove of fatal conſequence. <hi>O cupide negotiator</hi> (ſaith <hi>De-Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te)</hi> when a man hath ſo much buſineſs about his body, that he hath no leaſure to attend the buſineſs of his Soul, he is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſy, and makes his <gap reason="foreign">

which potently ſeduce and draw off the Soul from God.

Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, pleaſures are the bane of Souls, like the ſilly Bee, they are <hi>drowned in their own Hony.</hi> Gods voice grates upon the Ears accuſtomed to Muſick, and all manner of delightful ſounds. A bleeding crucified Chriſt is a moſt ingrateful object to the wanton Eye that hath been uſed only to behold pleaſant things. Yet it is to be obſerved that he doth not ſay, I am going to an Harlot but <hi>I have married a Wife,</hi> &amp; cannot come. Still, <hi>Licitis pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimus.</hi> Theſe are thoſe potent Seducers, which ſuiting with the ſtrong &amp; natural byaſs, &amp; inclinations of our hearts draw off from Chriſt. Man is too weak to withſtand the force of them, God doth not pleaſe upon every Soul to whom the Goſpel is Preached, to put forth his power. Hence Souls of the ſame ſpecies, under the ſame means, and aſſiſtances, yet incline and move diverſely. There is, there can be, nothing in man that makes him in pract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice to differ from his Neighbour. Let not therefore he who is thus <hi>drawn,</hi> glory, for it is God who hath drawn him. Nor let a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>murmur</hi> on the behalf of thoſe who are not thus <hi>drawn.</hi> Grace is the Lords own, he may do with it what he pleaſeth; <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith well concerning Grace, <hi>the cauſe why it is given to one, not to another, may be hidden and ſecret, but unjuſt it cannot be.</hi> In the mean time (as I ſaid before) I believe at the great day there will be not be found ſo much as one Soul that ſhall be able to accuſe God for the denial of this Grace, this powerful, and effectual Grace, who hath not voluntarily, reſiſted, and vexed the holy Spirit of God in the uſe of that common Grace, for the want of which he hath no reaſon to complain; and ſhall not the Lord be juſtified in refuſing to <hi>draw thoſe,</hi> who have firſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered a baſe luſt (which was in their power to have reſiſted) to draw them away from him? Shall not this <hi>powerful Grace</hi> be righteouſly denied to them, who have ſuffered themſelves by a revel to be drawn from a Sermon?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Further yet we may from hence have an account of thoſe many <hi>ſtartings aſide, from God of which his own People are guilty, and the inequality of gracious motions, and actions.</hi> Some ſeem to us to ſtand ſtill, others to move very ſlowly, others with great
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:61084:149" rendition="simple:additions"/>
heavineſs, and difficulty. All this difference depends upon the inequal diſtributions of Divine Grace, for although when this Oil is once in the <hi>Cruiſe,</hi> it ſhall not fail from it, till Grace ſhall be ſwallowed up in glory, but ſo much influence of Grace ſhall be continued as to juſtify the Lord in his promiſe, <hi>that he will never depart from the Soul to do it good, and he will put his fear into the heart, that it ſhall never depart from him;</hi> and the Soul ſhall be preſerved by the power of God through faith to Salvation, yet there may be, and are great differences as to the degrees of Gods Adminiſtrations. Nor yet poſſibly muſt the blame of theſe Souls <hi>not running,</hi> reſt upon God for <hi>not drawing?</hi> For although the Lord may ſometimes do it upon his prerogative and ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty,</p>
               <p n="1">1. To ſhew the freeneſs of his Grace in all the emanations of it, and that he is under no obligations to meaſure out to every Child an equal portion of the riches of his Grace, but as in the diſpoſal of his other talents of <hi>Riches, &amp; common gifts,</hi> he may if he pleaſe make inequal diſtributions as it pleaſeth him, giving out to ſome 10, to others 5, to others but one, ſo he may do as to his Talents of diſtinguiſhing Grace, whiles yet every one hath enough to conduct and preſerve his Soul unto eternal life and happineſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, He may do it to lay his people under the potent conviction of this truth, <hi>That their running depends upon his draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> God himſelf ſometimes aſſigns this as the reaſon of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction of worldly enjoyments, that they might know who it is that gave them. <hi>Hoſea</hi> 2. 8. 9. <hi>For ſhe did not know that I gave her Corn, and Wine, and Oil, and multiplied her Silver and Gold, which they prepared for</hi> Baal. <hi>Therefore will I return and take away my Corn in the time thereof, and my Wine in the ſeaſon thereof, and will recover my Wool, and my Flax,</hi> &amp;c. Thus alſo the Lord may do as to the diſpenſations of his Grace (that Grace I mean which is not neceſſary to Salvation) did we alwaies find an equal ſtrength againſt our luſts, and to our Spiritual duties, an equal readineſs to, and chearfulneſs in the Service of God, we ſhould attribute too much to our renewed nature, and not know in what a daily derivation from, and dependance upon God, even the beſt Souls live, and that all our freſh ſprings are from him. Did we Sail to Heaven through the Sea of this world, alwaies with a Trade wind, we ſhould not underſtand that the wind of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace (which is the breathing of the holy Spirit) bloweth
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:61084:150"/>
where it liſteth. But when we are becalmed in our voyage for the new <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> and forced to lie at Anchor, then we learn that without Chriſt we can do nothing.</p>
               <p>But though this muſt be ſaid to aver the Soveraignty of God, and to aſſert his wiſdom, yet moſt ordinarily theſe <hi>withdrawings are upon ſome provocations on our parts,</hi> the Clouds in the Heavens are cauſed from the <hi>Vapours</hi> which ariſe from the Earth. God can never be ſo provoked againſt a juſtified Soul as to withdraw himſelf wholly, but he may be, and is oft-time ſo far provoked, as to withdraw his gradual influences, ſo as the Soul ſhall feel that it is not with it as at former times, and cryeth out, <hi>where is my God become?</hi> When the Lord offereth a wind, and the Soul refuſeth to open its Sails when he moveth, and the Soul quencheth its motions, and grieveth him in his operations, he many times hides his face from it, &amp; it is troubled; the Soul that hath grieved the quickning Spirit, ſhall ſmart alittle for the want of quickning Grace, &amp; complain of dulneſs, &amp; heavineſs, &amp; liſtleſsneſs to its Spiritual Duty. I ſay this oft-times, yea moſt ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily is the cauſe. So as though it wants theſe divine drawings, yet its want of them, is the puniſhment of its iniquity.</p>
               <p>I ſhall conclude this diſcourſe with a word of advice, what ſuch Souls ſhould do, under ſuch diſpenſations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Search and ſee whether ſome late ſin, hath not provoked God to theſe withdrawings.</hi> See if thy conſcience (which in this caſe is thy beſt informer) doth not tell thee, that ſuch a time thou hadſt an impulſe or motion to prayer, or ſuch a duty (and that under convenient circumſtances) and thou neglectedſt it; or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered thee ſome help, and thou neglectedſt it. And now the righteous Lord hath left thee to thy own ſtrength, and thou feeſt what thou art, and humble thy Soul before God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new thy covenant with him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If thou canſt not find that any ſuch blot hath clave to thy Soul, <hi>yet acknowledge the Lords wiſdom, the freeneſs of his grace,</hi> and his righteouſneſs in his diſpenſations. We muſt allow God to do many things in infinite wiſdom, and righteouſneſs, though we cannot ſee or underſtand it, we muſt not look in this life to underſtand the reaſon of Gods works. It is enough for us to know that he hath done it, and that all his works are done in wiſdom and righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Take heed of <hi>lowing thy Sails,</hi> when thou <hi>thinkeſt the wind</hi>
                  <pb n="291" facs="tcp:61084:150"/>
                  <hi>abates.</hi> This you know is contrary to the methods of Mariners; I am ſure it is contrary to the wiſdom of Chriſtians; keep thy heart at ſuch a time with the moſt diligence, working and ſtriving againſt ſin. Tow thy Ship if thou canſt not Sail as at other times. Go if thou canſt not run, and keep thy Soul ready for a wind, whenever God will pleaſe to ſend it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Fourthly, <hi>Beg the returns of the bleſſed Spirit.</hi> Tell God of thy Souls weakneſs, or the ſtrength of thy corruptions, or temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; ſay unto God as <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> ſaid in another caſe; Lord I have a mighty hoſt coming againſt me, I know not what to do, I have no ſtrength againſt it, but my Eyes are unto thee.</p>
               <p n="5">5. After this, I know nothing more to be done, but a patient <hi>waiting for God, according to the reſolution of the Church,</hi> Iſaiah 8. 17. <hi>I will wait upon him, that hides his face from the houſe of</hi> Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, <hi>I will look for him.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Judging any kind of blind, and languid aſſent, to the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Goſpel to be that believing, to which the Holy Ghoſt in Scripture annexeth the promiſe of Salvation,</hi> A great many know no more by <hi>believing,</hi> but their <hi>agreement that Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God, that he was made man, and died for us.</hi> All which, and much more the Devils believe, and yet tremble. I do not think that an <hi>aſſent to the Propoſition of the Goſpel,</hi> be the aſſent what it will, is that <hi>Faith</hi> which <hi>juſtifieth.</hi> It is not the <hi>Propoſition of the Goſpel,</hi> but the <hi>Perſon of the Mediator,</hi> that is the <hi>object</hi> of that <hi>Faith;</hi> ſome indeed tell us, that <hi>Faith</hi> is an <hi>operative aſſent,</hi> and by that they have mended the matter: but if the <hi>Perſon of the Mediator,</hi> not the <hi>Propoſition of the Word</hi> be the <hi>formal,</hi> and <hi>proper object of true Faith,</hi> no <hi>aſſent</hi> can be the juſtifying act of Faith, for the <hi>Propoſition</hi> muſt be the object of that. There are ſeveral kinds of <hi>aſſent</hi> according to the light in which we ſee a Propoſition. We aſſent to things oft-times meerly upon report and hear-ſay, ſo as the <hi>aſſent</hi> is a meer humane Faith. Thus moſt Engliſhmen aſſent to this, that there was ſuch a Perſon as <hi>William the Conquerour.</hi> A thing they can ſee in no other light than that of humane reports in Hiſtory; of all other <hi>aſſents</hi> this is the weakeſt, and moſt invaluable, and before we give it, there muſt appear to us a probability in the thing; upon this account, none but thoſe who judge themſelves obliged to believe what the Church ſaith, and that thoſe Books were written by the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Church, believeth or aſſenteth to the ſtrange ſtories
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:61084:151"/>
in the <hi>Popiſh Legends,</hi> becauſe their reaſon tells them the things are improbable, yea, impoſſible, without a miraculous operation which they ſee no reaſon God ſhould work in ſuch a caſe, nor will men give their <hi>aſſents</hi> in ſuch caſes, but where they are not much concerned whether the thing be true or falſe, ſo as it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to them to agree the thing or to deny it. 2. <hi>Men aſſent to things upon the evidence of ratiocinations,</hi> they form concluſions from principles, and then aſſent to them. Now in regard our reaſon is not infallible; this <hi>aſſent</hi> likewiſe (though more ſtrong than the other) yet is but <hi>ſaint</hi> and <hi>incertain,</hi> and <hi>alters</hi> as we ſee better reaſon for the contrary. 3. <hi>There is an aſſent which is given to a Propoſition upon the account of a divine revelation.</hi> Now this aſſent is ſtronger or weaker, as the <hi>Revelation,</hi> is more <hi>ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or imperfectly, &amp; incertainly agreed.</hi> A man by a natural power may aſſent to the <hi>Propoſition of the Goſpel,</hi> as delivered to him by men: he that thus aſſenteth doth no more aſſent to what the Goſpel ſaith of Chriſt, than to what Hiſtories tell him of what was done by the <hi>Saxon</hi> or <hi>Norman Kings</hi> many hundred years a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go. Reaſon working upon its own principles ſheweth us nothing of Chriſt. The Scriptures are by all Chriſtians generally lookt upon as the Word of God, but no man hath any <hi>certain and firm perſuaſion that they are ſo,</hi> but he who <hi>is perſuaded of it by the Holy Spirit of God;</hi> all arguments from <hi>tradition</hi> and <hi>reaſon,</hi> have their incertainties, and though they are uſeful to make it proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to others, yet they do not produce a certainty of perſuaſion in our own Souls; hence the aſſent to ſuch <hi>Propoſitions</hi> as are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly revealed in Scripture, muſt alſo be faint and incertain, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently not operative, or very incertainly operative; ſo that although it may produce ſomething of practice, whiles the fit of aſſent is upon the Soul, yet it produceth no <hi>ſteady, certain</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant practice; ſo as though it ſhould be granted, that a <hi>practical aſſent</hi> to the Propoſition of the Goſpel, be true juſtifying faith, to which is annexed the pardon of ſin, yet if by it we mean ſuch an agreement of our minds to the truth, as produceth a certain, ſteady, conſtant or ordinary practice and courſe of life, confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to the propoſitions of truth which we agree, as this will imply truſting, and relying on Chriſt for life and ſalvation, ſo it is ſuch as is the <hi>operation of God in the Soul,</hi> and that not in a way of <hi>common providence</hi> (as our abilities<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to <hi>ſpeak</hi> or move are) but in a way of <hi>ſpecial favour</hi> and <hi>working,</hi> for mans <hi>agreeing</hi> to
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:61084:152"/>
the holy Scriptures to be the <hi>Word</hi> of God, firmly and ſteadily, being the reaſon why he agrees the truth of the propoſitions which are revealed in it alone, and that being the ſpecial work of God in Souls that ſhall be ſaved, of neceſſity ſuch alſo muſt be the aſſent to the Propoſitions that are revealed in it, and which can be ſeen by the Soul in no other light. So as indeed I do not think there is much in it more than a ſtrife about words, or at leaſt a very great nicety, whether true juſtifying Faith be <hi>a practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal aſſent</hi> to the <hi>Propoſitions</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> or a <hi>reliance on the Perſon of the Mediator,</hi> or rather both; for a <hi>practical aſſent</hi> doth neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily infer a reliance on the Perſon of the Mediator: Admitting that this is one Propoſition of the Goſpel, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 12. <hi>That there is no Salvation in any other, for there is no other name given under Heaven amongſt men, whereby we muſt be ſaved;</hi> and that the Soul in its practice of holineſs, hath any Eye to the recompence of reward, it is impoſſible there ſhould be any <hi>practical aſſent</hi> (to uſe the term of ſome) that is, any aſſent to the Propoſition, that ſhall produce any truth, or conſtancy of practice, without a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance upon, and truſting to the Perſon of the Mediator; and this muſt be the ſpecial work, and powerful operation of God in, and upon the Soul. But now if men make any kind of languid, weak and incertain <hi>aſſent</hi> to the Goſpel Faith, and think that they have <hi>true Faith,</hi> becauſe they agree the truth of the Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Scripture, they may miſerably deceive their own Souls; a Man by a mere natural power may as well agree, that there was ſuch a one as <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth</hi> once in the world, who went about doing good, exhorting men to a good life, and was Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, &amp;c. as that there was in <hi>England</hi> a <hi>William the Conqueror,</hi> or any thing elſe that is to be found in other Books of tolerable credit, and reputation in the World. Or if men think that they do truly believe, becauſe they agree many propoſitions of the Goſpel, which are evident in the light of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> they again de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive themſelves, here may be nothing of the <hi>operation of God</hi> in this faith. Nay if they agree the Propoſitions of the Goſpel, becauſe they are revealed there, and in the mean time do not agree the Scriptures to be the <hi>Word of God,</hi> but look upon them in the ſame rank with human writings, or only by an <hi>human saith</hi> agree them to be the Word of God, becauſe the Church hath ſo deliver'd, and tranſmitted them, here is all this while no thing of the <hi>ſpecial operation of God.</hi> Nor will
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:61084:152"/>
this <hi>agreement</hi> produce any <hi>ſteadineſs</hi> and <hi>firmneſs of practice,</hi> commenſurate to the Revelation, but only <hi>commenſurate</hi> to the nature of the <hi>Aſſent,</hi> which being not fixed, &amp; conſtant, nor it may be, not <hi>univerſal,</hi> but to ſome part only of the <hi>revelation,</hi> muſt neceſſarily bring forth no more than a <hi>ſaint, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial,</hi> and <hi>incertain, practice.</hi> Hence it is that Hypocrites may do many things contained in the law, and at one time be more warm than at other times. But if thy <hi>Aſſent</hi> be the ſpecial operation, thou aſſenteſt to the whole <hi>revelation,</hi> becauſe God hath fixed in thy Soul a perſuaſion that it is from him who cannot lie, it is alſo ſteady and fixed; and tho ſome doubts may poſſibly incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thee ſometimes, yet they hold not long, and thou firmly and generally (with allowance for the frailty and infirmity of human nature, endeavoureſt to live up to the whole of that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which the <hi>revelation</hi> impoſeth upon thee, which thou canſt not do, without relying on Chriſt, and him alone for Salvation, and having a reſpect to all the Commandments of God. And indeed, herein that agreement or aſſent which is the <hi>ſpecial work of God</hi> in the Soul, differs from that which is but a meer <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral action.</hi> 1. <hi>In that it is more fixed, certain, and univerſal;</hi> and this muſt be ſo, for our aſſent is according to our light, we muſt firſt ſee, before we agree the truth of a propoſition, now the light of the holy Spirit is without doubt the cleareſt and brigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt light. Our natural reaſon gives us but a dim light, as to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith. 2. <hi>In that it layeth a ſtronger obligation to practice.</hi> Reaſon will tell us, that the more firmly we believe the truth of Propoſitions, holding forth <hi>rewards</hi> and <hi>puniſhments</hi> relating to our practice, the ſtronger we ſhall find our obligation to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice in order to the obtaining ſuch rewards, or avoiding ſuch puniſhments. 3. <hi>In that it layeth an obligation to a more univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal practice.</hi> The obligation to practice riſeth no higher than the <hi>aſſent,</hi> ſo as if there be any duty to which we do not agree, our aſſent obligeth to no practice of that. Now the holy Spirit per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuades us of the truth of the whole revelation, and that in the fulleſt and trueſt ſenſe. Hence it is that the true believer is more warm and univerſal in his obedience, than it is poſſible a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother ſhould be, becauſe his aſſent unto the truth, is from a quite differing light, and a quite differing work of God, the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the former proceeding but from a common work of God in nature, the latter from a work of ſpecial grace by the

Spirit of God upon the Soul. I will not much contend with thoſe who will have true Faith to be a <hi>practical Aſſent</hi> to the <hi>Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Goſpel,</hi> if they by <hi>Aſſent</hi> mean a <hi>firm</hi> and <hi>ſteady</hi> Aſſent; and by <hi>practical,</hi> ſuch an <hi>Aſſent</hi> as obligeth ſtrongly to an <hi>univerſal</hi> practice of whatſoever is revealed as our Duty. 1. Becauſe I know a <hi>reliance upon Chriſt for eternal Salvation, muſt be the effect of ſuch an Aſſent.</hi> 2. Becauſe I know <hi>there can be no reliance on Chriſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch a praevious Aſſent to the Propoſition of the Goſpel.</hi> 3. Becauſe I know <hi>there can be no ſuch thing without the mighty Power of God upon the Soul.</hi> So that in this ſenſe the Soul muſt be <hi>drawn by the Father,</hi> before it come to Chriſt. Only let none deceive themſelves, (as to this point of true Believing) by fancying ſuch an Aſſent to the Doctrine of the Goſpel, <hi>true Faith,</hi> wherein God hath no further concern, than as he influenceth acts of Humane Nature flowing from that order of operations which he hath ſet in all rational Souls. True Faith muſt be more than this.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As to <hi>Faith</hi> men are alſo prone to cheat themſelves by calling their <hi>Natural preſumption Faith;</hi> we ſay <hi>Faith</hi> lies in a <hi>reſting,</hi> and <hi>reliance on Chriſt.</hi> Now many will tell us they reſt and rely on Chriſt, and yet it is no difficulty to evince they do but preſume and not believe. Reſting and relying on Chriſt for Salvation, muſt be the <hi>Father's drawing.</hi> Natural preſumptions are meerly from our ſelves. Every man is willing to hope well for, and to propheſie good unto himſelf. Hence living under the publication of the Goſpel, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heard of an <hi>eternal Life</hi> and <hi>Salvation,</hi> and this to be had through Chriſt, and by reſting on him, many naturally cry, they reſt on Chriſt, and truſt in him, and him alone. And our Saviour lets us know, that men may die with ſuch confidences, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 22, 23. Now there is a reſting and reliance on Chriſt, which is the <hi>Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> yea and the mighty work of God upon the Soul, and this many a poor Soul finds that lives months, and years, under the Spirit of bondage, before it can reſt on Chriſt, and quietly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it ſelf unto him; and there is a reſting, which is no more than a <hi>natural hope, or confidence,</hi> ariſing either from the Souls natural de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of good to it ſelf, or from its <hi>ignorance of the true grounds of a true reſting and reliance:</hi> And indeed by this may theſe two be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed and known aſunder, That <hi>reſting and reliance upon Chriſt for any ſpiritual and eternal bleſſing, which is the Operation of God, is alwa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="297" facs="tcp:61084:153"/>
in it. 1. I ſay <hi>firſt it is founded upon a Promiſe;</hi> for all Grace, and Eternal Life being the gift of God, it is as vain a thing for any to be confident they ſhall have it, without God's revelation of his Will as to it with reference to them; as it is for any man to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend a confidence, and truſt in another for the making him rich with a great part of his Eſtate, when that other never ſo declared his mind to him, or any one elſe. And 2. <hi>The Promiſes being not made to perſons by name, but to perſons that do thus &amp; thus, it is altogether as unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for any to pretend a reſt and confidence in Chriſt, for the collation of thoſe ſpiritual bleſſings, as it had been for any Commanders in the Jewiſh Army, having heard</hi> Saul<hi>'s declaration of his Will, That whoſoever kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth</hi> Goliah, <hi>ſhould have his Daughter to Wife, ſhould have promiſed himſelf</hi> Saul<hi>'s Daughter without incountring the Philiſtine.</hi> Now this reſting and relying on Chriſt, (which is the only true reliance) is ſo difficult by reaſon of our former ſins, and daily infirmities of humane nature, and the lapſes and backſlidings we are guilty of, that no man thus comes to Chriſt until he be <hi>drawn.</hi> Thus far I have ſhewed you how far this diſcourſe may be uſeful to guide us in our enquiry whether we be <hi>drawn and come to Chriſt yea,</hi> or no, directing you to diſtinguiſh true Faith, both from a <hi>faint</hi> and <hi>languid aſſent,</hi> and from a natural preſumption of our good Eſtate with reference to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But it may be further uſeful alſo to try your <hi>holineſs.</hi> That alſo muſt be the effect of <hi>Drawing Grace.</hi> There are two uſual miſtakes about holineſs.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt is when what we <hi>uſually call Moral Virtue</hi> is called holineſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When we miſtake it for a <hi>formal running a round of Religious Duties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſay firſt, When we miſtake holineſs, for what we uſually call <hi>Moral Virtue,</hi> or Moral Righteouſneſs. I put in thoſe words [we uſually call] becauſe I perceive ſome modern Writers (poſſibly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe pinched with their Arguments, who have contended for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe beſides Moral Virtue to be neceſſary tó ſalvation) have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the notion of <hi>Moral Virtue</hi> far beyond what <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and the reſt of the Philoſophers learnt us to underſtand by that name; and do not only bring <hi>Faith</hi> within the compaſs of it, but will pretend it to be neceſſary to it, that the action to be done ſhould be performed from a <hi>Principle of Faith,</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> and directed to the Glory of God as their end. Theſe acts and actings our Fore-fathers
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:61084:154" rendition="simple:additions"/>
were wont to call <hi>Grace;</hi> but to let us know that thoſe in our days who have inlarged the acts of <hi>Morality,</hi> mean no more, than what men may do, by nature, having no more than the motives of the Goſpel, and the aſſiſtances of the Spirit, common to all to whom the Goſpel is Preached, therefore they well call theſe things <hi>Moral Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</hi> As to Moral Virtue in the latter notion of it, it cannot be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken for holineſs, for it is ſo. It is in the antienteſt, and moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per notion of it, that I am ſpeaking to it. So <hi>Chaſtity, Sobriety, Temperance, Liberality, Juſtice,</hi> are moral habits, and the <hi>acts of them</hi> are acts of Moral Virtue and Righteouſneſs; whether he that doth them doth them out of any Principle of <hi>Faith,</hi> or <hi>Love,</hi> or <hi>Obedience,</hi> or with any reſpect to the Glory of God, yea or no; but if any thinks this is <hi>holineſs,</hi> he is wonderfully miſtaken, for it is eſſentially neceſſary to an <hi>act of holineſs,</hi> that it ſhould be done from a <hi>Principle of Faith,</hi> the Soul being fully perſuaded, that it is the <hi>Will of God,</hi> and in <hi>Obedience to his Will,</hi> eying his command in our action. And 3. Propoſing to our ſelves the <hi>Honour and Glory of God</hi> for our end. So that though the ſame acts be done, yet if they be done from other Principles, and to other ends, they may be acts of <hi>Moral Virtue</hi> (that is, under the government, and conduct, and guidance of reaſon) but no acts of holineſs. Beſides, there are many actions which are our duties, in obedience to the Will of God, the reaſonableneſs of which is not to be concluded (nor ever was concluded by the men of reaſon amongſt the Heathens) from any other Principle than this, That it is the higheſt reaſon that we ſhould do what God commands us. So that to reduce our duty as Chriſtians, to the Precepts of what we have uſed to call <hi>Moral Virtue,</hi> is partly to ſecure our ſelves from a great part of our duty, by that Art, and partly to do what we do out of ſuch Principles as God will never more thank us for, than we will do our Servants, for doing what we would have them do, but they do out of reſpect to themſelves, without any regard to the pleaſing of, or obeying us. Now, though it be true, that acts of <hi>Moral Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi> (that is conformable to natural reaſon) may be performed by men without any ſpecial influence of the Holy Spirit: Yet without ſuch a <hi>Drawing Influence</hi> the Soul will neither do thoſe acts, from any <hi>true Principle,</hi> or <hi>to any right end:</hi> Nor yet do many things which are required of us (under the notion of holineſs) in order to eternal life. Beſides, the <hi>holineſs</hi> required of us is in <hi>all our converſation,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 11. Now it is obſerved of the greateſt Moraliſts, that they failed here, and indulged themſelves in ſome things of immorality,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:61084:154"/>
yet went for <hi>morally virtuous men,</hi> if they excelled in <hi>Juſtice,</hi> though they failed in <hi>Temperance, Sobriety,</hi> and <hi>Chaſtity,</hi> &amp;c. And indeed herein is the <hi>drawing of Divine Grace</hi> with reſpect to holineſs ſeen, and from hence to be judged. If the Soul finds it ſelf under a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant obligation to whatſoever God hath commanded, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God hath commanded it, and that it might pleaſe him, and do what is acceptable in his ſight. This no Soul doth from a meer na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural power; and though the renewed Soul be made willing, yet to keep on in this courſe it ſtands in need of the daily excitings and quickenings, and aſſiſtances of the Holy Spirit.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſecond miſtake which men may be deceived by, as to <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> is when they take <hi>a formal performance of Religious duties</hi> to be it. <hi>Holineſs</hi> lieth in <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs.</hi> And as men may miſtake <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> towards men for <hi>Holineſs,</hi> ſo they may as eaſily miſtake a <hi>Form of Godlineſs,</hi> which may conſiſt (as the Apoſtle teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us) with a <hi>denial of the Power of it</hi> to be Holineſs. <hi>Godlineſs</hi> in the ſenſe I am ſpeaking to it, ſignifieth the performance of thoſe acts of homage and worſhip, which God hath required of us to his more immediate Service and Glory. This lieth in the performance of ſome external actions of God immediately, according to the preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Divine Will, which reſpecting the manner, as well as the matter, all ſuch actions as are meer <hi>bodily labour,</hi> are indeed no <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,</hi> but meer <hi>formal</hi> performances, and things ſo ſhort of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Commands of God, that God in Scripture is ſaid not to require them, that is, not them alone, or them performed in ſuch a manner, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 12. <hi>When you come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hands, to tread my Courts? Bring no more vain Oblations; Incenſe is an abomination unto me; the New Moons, and Sabbaths, the calling of Aſſemblies, I cannot away with, even the Solemn Meetings: Your New Moons, and your appointed Feaſts, my Soul hateth; they are a trouble to me.</hi> God had appointed all theſe things; he had commanded they ſhould tread his Courts, bring Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, offer Incenſe, keep New Moons, and Sabbaths; but all theſe things ought to have been done out of love to God, with a Faith in Chriſt, and with pure hearts; not being ſo performed, they were no Godlineſs, but meer abomination unto God. The caſe with us under the Goſpel is the ſame, though our Acts of homage there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed be of another, more reaſonable and ſpiritual nature. God hath required of us to <hi>pray,</hi> to <hi>praiſe,</hi> to <hi>hear his Word,</hi> to <hi>partake of his Supper.</hi> He hath alſo preſcribed us the <hi>manner</hi> in which we ought to
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:61084:155" rendition="simple:additions"/>
do theſe acts; in <hi>Faith,</hi> in <hi>Obedience,</hi> with the <hi>intention of our minds, attention of our thoughts, fervency of ſpirit.</hi> Separate the more exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal acts from theſe, they are no better than <hi>formal performances, bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily exerciſes,</hi> neither acceptable to God, nor profitable to our ſelves: If men will call theſe Godlineſs, or Holineſs, it is a great miſtake. The external acts are indeed ſuch as men that live under the Goſpel may be excited to perform, and may perform without any <hi>ſpecial influence of Grace,</hi> by vertue of his natural powers and abilities, and the common Grace of God not denied to any: But when they are done, without due affections, and principles, and inward motions of the heart correſpondent to the nature of the actions, according to the revelation of the Divine Will, they are no Holineſs, but Hypocriſie; and thus they cannot be performed without the <hi>aſſiſtance and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of ſpecial Grace.</hi> Thus from this notion of the neceſſity of <hi>Chriſt's drawing</hi> both with reference to our <hi>firſt coming to Chriſt for life,</hi> and further <hi>following him,</hi> walking with him, and running after him. Chriſtians may be able to judge both concerning the <hi>Truth</hi> of their <hi>Faith,</hi> and alſo of their <hi>Holineſs.</hi> If either be true, they muſt be the effect of <hi>Divine ſpecial Grace,</hi> and more than any can do from the powers of Nature, even the beſt educated Nature, not renewed, changed and influenced by ſpecial and diſtinguiſhing grace. I am fully of their mind who think that thoſe Souls, who are no further changed and reformed, or converted, than might be from the power of Nature rationally improving <hi>Moral Principles, and Goſpel Motives and Arguments,</hi> cannot be ſaved: But yet I am ſo charitable, as to think that many may be ſaved who <hi>think</hi> they have no other <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion than this;</hi> the workings of the Spirit of God upon our Souls are ſo indiſcernable and internal, that we may poſſibly miſtake them for the <hi>workings</hi> of meerly our own powers and faculties, under the advantages of the Goſpel; but they muſt be more than ſuch, or elſe (as I have before ſaid) man is the firſt Author of all <hi>ſpiritual good,</hi> both with reſpect to <hi>action</hi> and <hi>fruition,</hi> to himſelf, and clearly his own Saviour, and muſt make himſelf to differ from another, and that by the higheſt, and moſt ſpiritual difference, and one man's Soul muſt have different and inequal vertues from the Soul of his Brother, whoſe Soul is of the ſame ſpecies, and hath the ſame faculties. But I have dwelt long enough upon this branch of Application.</p>
               <p>Let every one now by this <hi>Examine himſelf,</hi> whether the <hi>Faith</hi> that he thinks he hath, be a meer <hi>Aſſent</hi> to the Propoſition of the Goſpel, upon the <hi>Evidence</hi> of it he hath had from the Church, or from
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:61084:155"/>
men, or a meer languid incertain Aſſent, from probable Arguments of Reaſon, or a meer <hi>preſumption</hi> bottomed upon no Promiſe. Or, whether it be a <hi>firm and fixed Aſſent</hi> to the Truths of the Goſpel underſtood by him, conjoyned with a <hi>reliance</hi> upon the Perſon of the Mediator, clearly revealed in the Goſpel, as the only Saviour of Man, and producing an endeavour in all things to live up to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Promiſe? Whether the <hi>Holineſs</hi> which he thinketh his Soul hath arrived at, lieth in a meer <hi>Moral Righteouſneſs,</hi> a forbearance of groſs and ſcandalous courſes of ſin, and a doing ſuch acts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Charity, as a man may do from the meer improvement and conduct of reaſon, and a meer <hi>Formality of Godlineſs,</hi> a performance of ſuch acts of homage, as God hath preſcribed, without reſpect to the manner in which God hath willed them to be performed.</p>
               <p>If your pretended Faith and Holineſs be no more, truſt not to them as Evidences that you are <hi>come to Chriſt;</hi> all this may be without any thing of this drawing; your Faith is no more than that mentioned, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 22. where our Saviour tells you that <hi>many</hi> (pretendedly truſting in, and relying upon him, as may appear by what they ſaid) ſhould ſay to him in that day; <hi>Lord! Lord! Have we not propheſied in thy Name, and in thy Name have caſt out Devils, and in thy Name done many wonderful works? to whom he would ſay, I never knew you, depart from me, you workers of iniquity.</hi> God had never promiſed Heaven &amp; Salvation, to a <hi>propheſying in his Name,</hi> nor to a <hi>caſting out of Devils,</hi> ſo as their confidence, or reliance on, or in Chriſt, was the growing up of a <hi>Ruſh without Mire;</hi> a truſting without a ground, or bottom: Your Holineſs and Righteouſneſs is no more than that of the Phariſee, who gloried, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. 11, 12. That <hi>he was not as other men were, Extortioners, Unjuſt, Adulterers;</hi> he <hi>faſted twice a week, and gave Alms of all that he poſſeſſed.</hi> Our Saviour ſaith, he went away not <hi>juſtified.</hi> And <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 20. <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept your Righteouſneſs exceed the Righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, you can never enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi> Say to your ſelves ſeverally, My Soul, thou muſt one day come before the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Seat of Chriſt, and begging for admittance into Heaven, thou wouldeſt be loth to hear the Lord in that day ſay to thee, <hi>Depart from me, I know thee not.</hi> My Soul, what haſt thou more to truſt to than they had? Canſt thou ſay any more than Lord! I am not as other men? <hi>I am no Swearer, no Drunkard, no Reviler, no Extortioner, no Whoremonger; Lord, I faſt often, I go to prayers often, and to Church often,</hi> to hear the Word; if thou haſt no more to ſay, the Phariſee
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:61084:156"/>
had as much. The intereſt of a man's own body, or eſtate, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of other men, the credit and applauſe of the world, may move a reaſonable Soul, under no other power than that of reaſon, nor other influence, than that which all within the compaſs of the Church, where the Goſpel is Preached, may carry thee thus far, without any influence of powerful, ſpecial Grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Uſe 3.</note> Further yet, this notion of Truth, may help to relieve many good Souls, who are diſcouraged, <hi>either becauſe they ſeem to themſelves to ſtick in the New Birth:</hi> Or, <hi>becauſe they find in themſelves a great weakneſs to ſpiritual duties:</hi> Or, <hi>impotency in the reſiſtance of their own intrinſick motions to ſin, or forein temptations.</hi> As eaſie a thing as ſome make it to believe; many Souls ſmitten of God, and truly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted under the ſenſe of ſin, find it one of the moſt difficult things in the world, to give ſuch a <hi>firm and ſteady Aſſent to the Revelation of the Goſpel,</hi> as will produce in their Souls any grounded confidence, and reſting on the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> as our Saviour, and ſhall be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of ſuch a change of heart and life as the Goſpel requireth. Hence, though they be truly wounded in the ſenſe of ſin, and have taken up reſolutions through the Grace of God, to ſin no more as they have done formerly; yet they cannot tell how to bring their Souls to any fiducial adherence and reſt on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but they are ſtill full of doubts and fears concerning their ſpiritual and eternal ſtate; the guilt of their ſins is upon their conſciences, and they pine away, in, and under it; but they are not able to reach out an hand to the Promiſe in and through Chriſt; they have deep ſights of their miſery, but they can ſee no hope, no mercy at all in God for them. Now to ſuch Souls as theſe, this is ſome relief to conſider, <hi>That no man cometh to the Son unleſs the Father draweth him.</hi> It is no wonder that thou who haſt formerly been not a ſtranger only, but an enemy to God, canſt not at firſt come unto him, without a powerful influence of Divine Grace; when as thoſe who are brought home to God, ſtand in need of a daily Divine Influence to enable them to walk with him, and to run after him. This is not the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or frowardneſs, or badneſs of thine heart alone; it is the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every lapſed Soul. And here the thinking Soul will come to feel the wound given it by the <hi>Fall of Adam,</hi> and its own <hi>original</hi> corruption. No man hath by nature more aptitude than another to acts truly ſpiritual. You will ſay, this is very cold comfort. We are ſure, if we be without Chriſt, we are undone; and what if our hearts be no worſe than others were till they were made better by the
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:61084:156" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Power of Divine Grace, ſo long as that they are ſo bad as we cannot come to Chriſt for life? We have been lying in this ſtate at the <hi>Pool of Betheſda,</hi> under the Ordinances of God, many months and years; others within the time have been rolled in; here we lie ſtill as weak as ever. I will but offer two things to the relief of a Soul thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That every Chriſtian drawn to Chriſt, doth not preſently diſcern it. Faith,</hi> is one thing, the ſenſe of that Faith is another thing. Many a <hi>Child of Light</hi> doth not walk in the Light. I would hope charitably, that that Soul which complains that it cannot believe, and ſeriouſly bemoans its impotency, doth believe; a ſerious deſire to believe, is generally the fruit of believing. I would ſay to the Soul that thus complaineth, Thou art awakened to conſider an Eternity, and that thy Soul is haſtening towards an Eternity; yet thou doſt not deſpair, thou haſt ſome hope: In what is thy hope? What doſt thou truſt in, with reference to thy Eternal Happineſs? Such a Soul will eaſily ſee, that its <hi>Moral Righteouſneſs,</hi> or <hi>Formal Performance of Duties,</hi> are not the things it hopeth in; Where then is thy hope, (thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of hope which keep thee out of the Pit of deſpair,) fixed? Where can it be fixed but in Chriſt exhibited in the Promiſes of the Goſpel, ſo as thou rather complaineſt for want of ſenſe, than for want of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>If thou doſt but pray, and wait, thou ſhalt ſee.</hi> Chriſt will make thee to ſee, that he hath drawn thy Soul unto himſelf. Never poor Soul periſhed under thy circumſtances, that is, heavy loaden under the ſenſe of ſin, and weary of its ſinful courſes, and ſenſible that it hath no Righteouſneſs wherein it can ſtand before God, and panting and thirſting after the Lord and his Righteouſneſs. I have alwaies thought that God would not be wanting to any as to his ſpecial Grace, that had made the beſt improvement he could of <hi>common Grace.</hi> But this caſe riſeth higher; God hath begun his good work in thy Soul, and he will perfect it; he hath begun with thee in a way of ſpecial Grace, and more ſhall be added; he hath brought to the birth, and ſhall he not give ſtrength to bring forth? ſo as thou haſt nothing to do but to pray, to wait upon God in his Ordinances, and to wait for God with patience.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I hear others complaining, They would run after God, they would follow the Lord fully; the Spirit is willing, but the Fleſh is weak; they find their corruptions, their temptations ſo ſtrong, their ſtrength againſt them ſo ſmall, that they wonder they
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:61084:157"/>
hold out ſo long, and fear they ſhall one day fall. They cannot find that they run after Chriſt; ſomething of duty they do, but with ſo much dulneſs and heavineſs, as is far from running. Chriſtian! be of good comfort:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Lord will draw thee;</hi> do what in thee lieth, the Lord will draw thee. <hi>Who</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) ſhall deliver me from this body of death?</hi> He preſently ſubjoyns, <hi>I thank God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> The Spouſe prayeth in Faith, when ſhe ſaith, <hi>Draw me, and we will run after thee.</hi> If <hi>Abraham</hi> had conſidered his own body, at that time dead (as to ſuch acts) or the <hi>deadneſs of</hi> Sarah's <hi>womb,</hi> he had never glorified God by a <hi>ſtrong Faith</hi> in the Promiſe; <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 21. He conſidered none of theſe, but the Promiſe only, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that <hi>what the Lord had promiſed, he was able to perform.</hi> Thou conſidereſt how buſie the Devil is, and what he can do: How <hi>ſtrong thy luſts are,</hi> how weak thou art, and how little thou art able to do. But thou doſt not conſider what a mighty God can do; what he can do who hath ſaid, <hi>To him that hath ſhall be given, and he ſhall have in more abundance.</hi> Thou ſeeſt a great Mountain of luſts and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, great Mountains of temptations, and thou art afraid: <hi>But what art thou O great Mountain before the Lord's</hi> Zerubbabel? If it be the Lord's work, who ſhall let him?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider, <hi>The Lord may ſometimes not draw <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> as at other times, and our running will bear a proportion to his drawing.</hi> The Mother will never leave the little Child to go wholly alone, for fear it falls; ſhe will alwaies have an hand upon it; but ſhe may ſometimes put forth more, ſometimes leſs of the ſtrength of that hand. God never leaveth us wholly to our ſelves; he knows we cannot ſtand, or go without him; but he ſometimes lets us feel more of his ſtrength, ſometimes leſs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Going ſlowly when God ſlackens his hand, is indeed running,</hi> that is, equivalent to a going faſter with a further influence. It is like the <hi>Widdows Mite,</hi> who hath no more to put in. Like <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s chattering like a Crane. Like the voice of <hi>David</hi>'s weeping.

                  <note place="margin">Uſe 5.</note> IT is a great point that I am upon from the Petition of the Text <hi>Draw me,</hi> viz. <hi>That the Soul muſt be drawn before it will move toward Chriſt,</hi> either by <hi>coming to him,</hi> in its firſt <hi>converſion,</hi> or by <hi>running after him:</hi> I have been ſome time upon it, I ſhall now ſhut up my diſcourſe with ſome few words of exhortation, which ſhall reſpect all Men and Women. 1. <hi>Thoſe that are yet without Chriſt,</hi> not come <hi>unto him.</hi> 2. Such as <hi>are come unto him,</hi> yet are under obligations to <hi>run after him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. To the firſt I would ſpeak two things. 1. <hi>Never think ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of coming to Chriſt, or running after him in your own natural ſtrength.</hi> It is a rock which many Souls daſh, and are eternally ſpilt upon. They ſay not, there is no hope, they have found the life of their hands, therefore they are not grieved. It is one of the moſt dangerous deceits of a mans heart, for him to ſay he hath his Spiritual life in his own hands, to think that he hath a power within himſelf, and can turn to Chriſt, when he pleaſeth, or to bleſs himſelf as in a good condition, when indeed his condition is very bad. Let me a little ſhew you the miſchief of this er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If I could ſay no more, than <hi>that it is a falſe perſuaſion,</hi> yet that were enough to defame it to every reaſonable Soul, the Soul inſtead of having <hi>its life,</hi> hath no more than a <hi>lie</hi> in its right hand; the object of our underſtanding is truth, falſhood is what it ought naturally to reject and abhor. Men are but in an ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition when they are forced <hi>to make lies their refuge, and to hide themſelves under falſhood,</hi> Iſ. 28. 15. What a ſad ſtate is that Soul in, that is put to make a <hi>lie its refuge,</hi> and to hide itſelf from the reflections of its conſcience, under falſhood! His conſcience tells
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:61084:158"/>
him he periſheth for ever, if he abideth in the State he is in, what relieves him? he thinks he can repent, and believe, and turn to God when he liſteth, and ſo goeth on in his ſinful courſes, ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth his Ears againſt the voice of the Lords Charmers. Here is now a lie made the refuge of the Soul.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But <hi>Secondly,</hi> a further miſchief lies here, <hi>That whereas the drawings of Divine Grace do uſually follow ſome means, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to be uſed on our part. and that in time, this falſe perſuaſion, takes us off the timely uſe of ſuch means, and endeavours, upon the uſe of which God ordinarily comes in with the further power of his Grace.</hi> Admit a thing neceſſary to be done, and ſo allowed by us, yet if it be laborious, painful, or any way ingrateful as to the means to be uſed in the doing of it, and it be a thing which we know, or believe we can do when we will, we are never haſty to do it, but very apt to defer and put it off from time to time, and to omit thoſe means, the uſe of which is not pleaſing to our ſenſe; whereas if we be convinced that the thing is not in our own power, but requires the aſſiſtance of another, if we appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it neceſſary for us, tho the <hi>means</hi> be unpleaſing, yet we will not neglect the uſe of them. For example, admit a man ſick of ſome dangerous diſeaſe, and he apprehendeth, that without the uſe of ſome skilful Phyſitian he cannot live, though he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come at this Phyſician without a laborious journey, and knows the Phyſick will not pleaſe his pallat, yet a man will not loſe his opportunity, nor neglect taking Phyſick according to the Phyſicians preſcription; whereas if he apprehends his diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſuch, as he knows at any time how to remove, by ſome means in his own power, he is very prone to put off the uſe of means from time to time, until poſſibly it be too late. This is the caſe of a Soul, perſuaded that it hath its life in its own hands, a power in itſelf when it pleaſeth to <hi>repent, believe</hi> and <hi>turn to God;</hi> theſe things being not pleaſing to fleſh and blood, the Soul is very prone to ſlight and neglect the means, with which God uſeth to concur, giving the Soul a power to do theſe things above what it hath in itſelf, but now admit a Soul poſſeſſed of the <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity</hi> of <hi>faith, repentance,</hi> and <hi>new obedience,</hi> in order to its eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal happineſs, and alſo to know that it cannot do theſe things without a powerful influence of Divine Grace, which God uſeth not to give out in the neglect, but in the uſe of thoſe <hi>means of Grace,</hi> which he hath appointed, eſpecially if it knows that the
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:61084:158"/>
Spirit of God ſhall not <hi>alwaies ſtrive with man,</hi> it will neglect no time, no uſe of means, but in the morning ſow its Seed, and not ſuffer its hand in the Evening to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lack, becauſe it knoweth not which ſhall proſper, this or that, with what means, or at what time God will concur, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 57. 10. <hi>Thou ſaidſt that thou hadſt thy life in thy hands, therefore thou wert not grieved.</hi> The Jews had uſed all means to make piece, and leagues with other Nations, and had at length obtained it, and thence concluded they had <hi>their life in their hands;</hi> they were well enough, and ſafe enough, and therefore they were not at all grieved for their ſins againſt God, which was a means in order to their true ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. It is even thus with the Soul, did it lie under the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful conviction of this truth, That of itſelf it hath no power to repent, believe, or turn to God, it would then be troubled for its ſad and miſerable eſtate, and look out for Salvation in and by Chriſt, waiting upon him in ordinances, and by prayer crying to him to draw it unto himſelf, but ſo long as it is poſſeſt of an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of ſufficiency in itſelf, it neglecteth the timely uſe of ſuch means as muſt be uſed in order to eternal Salvation by, and from Chriſt, upon this ſcore I conceive it was that Chriſt told the Phariſees, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 32. <hi>That Publicans and Harlots ſhould enter into the Kingdom of Heaven before them.</hi> The <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees</hi> ſaid they had their life in their hands, they could ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they were <hi>Lords,</hi> and therefore they would not come to Chriſt; the Apoſtle telleth us that the Jews <hi>going about to eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh their own righteouſneſs, ſubmitted not themſelves to the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God,</hi> Rom. 10. 3.</p>
               <p n="3">3. May it not be doubted whether God will ever <hi>draw that Soul that faneieth that it ſtands in no need of his drawing?</hi> It is ſaid of God, that <hi>he reſiſteth the proud, and giveth grace to the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> What is <hi>Pride</hi> but an <hi>high, and undue opinion of our ſelves?</hi> Whether it be upon the account of ſome gifts of common Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, ſuch as <hi>Riches, Honours, &amp;c. or common gifts of the Spir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it,</hi> ſuch as <hi>knowledge,</hi> the <hi>gift of prayer,</hi> or <hi>prophecying,</hi> or (which indeed is the worſt of all) upon the opinion of ſome <hi>conceited righteouſneſs in our ſelves,</hi> or ſome <hi>ſpiritual power, and abilities</hi> we have, or judge our ſelves to have; the latter is <hi>Spiritual Pride,</hi> nor is any thing more oppoſite to the truth, and Grace of the Goſpel; the whole deſign of the Goſpel, is to exalt Chriſt as the <hi>Lord our righteouſneſs,</hi> and our <hi>ſtrength,</hi> and our great duty is
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:61084:159"/>
to accept him in that notion, nor indeed can he be truly recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in any other notion; now can it be reaſonably imagined, that he whoſe <hi>arm uſeth to bring Salvation;</hi> when he looketh and ſeeth <hi>there is none to ſave,</hi> ſhould bring <hi>Salvation</hi> to a Soul, that apprehends it hath no need at all of him, he hath done enough for it, in giving it a reaſonable Soul, and the <hi>Preaching of the Goſpel.</hi> Theſe are now ſome of thoſe great Evils, that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequential to this error imbibed by the Soul; but you will ſay to me: what can a Man or Woman in his or her natural ſtate do in order to his being drawn by Divine Grace? To this I anſwer,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> He may not oppoſe or ſet himſelf againſt the workings of this Divine Grace.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> He may do ſome things that may be conducive.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the firſt place <hi>do not reſiſt the Grace of God, nor ſet your ſelves in oppoſition to it;</hi> You will ſay then, can Grace be reſiſted, did not you tell us it is powerful, and ſhall be obeyed?</p>
               <p>I anſwer. I did tell you that Grace is powerful, and cannot be <hi>finally reſiſted,</hi> but it may be a long time reſiſted and oppoſed. The holy Spirit, is the moſt potent agent, and muſt at laſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, but it may be vexed and grieved. I know what ſome will ſay; what if I do reſiſt, if I do oppoſe it, if God hath deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined me to <hi>liſe, and to Grace, as the means,</hi> it ſhall at laſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come? I anſwer that is true, but yet it is no vain counſel to give any to adviſe them to take heed of ſuch reſiſtings, and vexings of the Spirit of God, as it is capable of, and that upon a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold account.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe <hi>he who thus reſiſteth the Holy Spirit, juſtifieth God in his condemnation,</hi> and not putting forth ſuch a power of Grace as ſhall be effectual of its Salvation; thoſe who plead ſo highly for a power in man to what is Spiritually good, lay a great ſtreſs upon their fancy, that if we do not allow this, we make the deſtruction of a Sinner to be from God, not from himſelf, but they do not conſider two things. 1. <hi>That whatſoever deſtruction we derive from</hi> Adam, <hi>is from our ſelves, for in</hi> Adam <hi>all died</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle.) God is neither bound to reſtore unto us the Grace he once gave us, and we loſt, nor yet unjuſt in requiring of us the exerciſe of that power, which we once had of his gift, and have loſt through our own default (for the default of our firſt Parent in whom we all ſinned, and dyed was our own.) 2. <hi>That the reſiſtance of the holy Spirit in its more common Grace and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations</hi>
                  <pb n="309" facs="tcp:61084:159"/>
                  <hi>is a ſufficient clearing of God in the condemnation of Sinners, though he doth not give out his effectual Grace;</hi> he hath ſaid, <hi>that to him that hath ſhall be given.</hi> The ſenſe of which (tho <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. and in the parallel Text it may be <hi>to him that hath any thing of ſpecial diſtinguiſhing grace, ſhall be more given of the ſame nature</hi> and kind yet) is plainly, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 29. (where it is uſed in the expoſition of the parable of the Talents) <hi>To him that improveth what he hath,</hi> and may very well be interpreted into a promiſe of <hi>fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Grace</hi> to him that makes a good improvement of common Grace. The juſtice of Gods judgment upon thoſe of <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> was from this manifeſted to the world. That Chriſt <hi>would oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times have gathered them as an Hen gathereth her Chickens under her wings, but they would not.</hi> If a man muſt be ruined, yet ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he ſhould not ruine himſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, <hi>Tho if thou beeſt one ordained to life, the Grace of God towards thee ſhall not be finally reſiſted; yet thy reſiſtances, and oppoſition may make the new birth, much harder, and more full of pain to thee.</hi> It is a moſt certain truth, that the foundation of God ſtandeth ſure, the Lord knoweth who are his, and not one of thoſe whom the Father hath by his Eternal gift given to Chriſt ſhall be loſt, they may for a time oppoſe and reſiſt the motions, and knockings of his Spirit, but it ſhall at laſt overcome them, but the Soul in its coming unto Chriſt, uſually meets with the <hi>Spirit of bondage, making it to fear before it receiveth the Spir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it of adoption, teaching it to cry</hi> Abba <hi>Father.</hi> Now thy oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and reſiſtances to the Spirit of Grace may keep thee much longer under the Spirit of bondage; and for this, I appeal to the experiences of all thoſe who have been brought home to Chriſt, whether they have not found the oppoſitions and reſiſtances which they have made, to the knocks, and motions of the Holy Spirit, have not lain heavy upon them, before they have been able to diſcern a gracious acceptation; whether when their faith in Chriſt hath got above their other ſins, the follies, and vanities of their youth, they have not found it ſtick here. They could hope in Chriſt, and in the free and infinite Grace of God through him, were it not that they remember, how often they refuſed the tenders of Grace, and put off the holy Spirit, knocking at the door of their hearts. Now what knoweſt thou O Chriſtian but that thou art an <hi>elect veſſel,</hi> one <hi>ordained to eternal life,</hi> and <hi>ſalvation,</hi> if ſo, thou ſhalt certainly be brought home to Chriſt,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:61084:160"/>
and be ſaved, notwithſtanding thy preſent reſiſtance and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, but it may be <hi>as through fire,</hi> why ſhouldeſt thou make thy new birth more painful, and difficult?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, <hi>When thy Soul is brought home to God</hi> (if ever thou ſeeſt that happy hour) <hi>it will while thou liveſt he a grief of heart unto thee, to think how long thou didſt oppoſe, and reſiſt the Grace of God, bringing Salvation in the tenders of it to thy Soul.</hi> The Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, have their ſad, and dark hours, as well as their hours of light and comfort, they will tell you from their own experience, that when they reflect a ſad Eye upon their former ways, they find nothing lying more ſad and heavy upon their Souls, than their ſo long reſiſting, and oppoſing the Grace of God, before they ſubmitted to it, to all their ſins they have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded this great iniquity, that when the Lord ſaid to them, yet <hi>Believe and you ſhall be ſaved,</hi> they to go on in their ſinful cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, put off the Spirit of God from day to day, and ſent him ſad away from their Souls, and why ſhould Chriſtians make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves matter of trouble and ſorrow hereafter, how graciouſly ſoever God will deal with their Souls? O therefore let all that wiſh well to their own Souls, be ſo far from oppoſing, or hindering the drawings of Divine Grace, as to do what in them lies in order to the obtaining of them; you will ſay unto me, what is that, what can we do either, as to the hindering or obtaining them?</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, <hi>As you may hinder theſe influences by omitting your at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance upon hearing the word: ſo you may by your conſcientious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance upon it, do ſomething in order to the obtaining of it.</hi> I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that the blind men in the Goſpel, obſerved, and placed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in <hi>Chriſts walks,</hi> the way wherein he was to go. He that conſcientiouſly waiteth upon the preaching of the Word, placeth himſelf in the way wherein Chriſt uſeth to go. He that walks to the Ale-houſe, or to his worldly buſineſs, or abideth in his Houſe, when he ſhould walk to a Sermon, is out of <hi>Chriſts walk,</hi> and as this is in his own power to avoid, ſo by not avoiding, he hindereth divine drawings. The Preaching of the Word is the ordinance of God for the Salvation of the Elect, when Chriſt was lifted up, he by this drew all thoſe Gentiles that were converted to the faith of Chriſt; you know in the drawing of a thing by a Cord, there is neceſſary, a <hi>Cord to draw with,</hi> which muſt de faſtned to the thing we would draw, when it is faſtned, he that draweth muſt put to his ſtrength, it is not the
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:61084:160"/>
                  <hi>Cord</hi> that draweth, but the power and ſtrength of the mans arm that uſeth the Cord. That which is drawn here is the <hi>Soul of man,</hi> a poor dead Soul, that hath in it no principle of Spiritual life, and of itſelf cannot come to Chriſt. He that draweth is God, the holy Spirit of God, and that by the power of an everlaſting arm; but now the Cord is the word of God (ſo God hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained) either ſome terrible word of threatning, or ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable word of promiſe, ſome word of God, is by the holy Spirit faſtned upon the Soul, by this the Soul is drawn, yet not by the force of the Word, but by the power of the Spirit ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king uſe of the Word; now he who neglects the reading, or hearing of the word, hinders his own drawing, he rejecteth and refuſeth the Cord, which though alone, it would not draw the Soul, yet is the mean, the <hi>Cord</hi> in the hand of the Spirit, by which ordinarily Souls are drawn that do come to Chriſt. On the other ſide thoſe Souls that are diligent, and careful to read and hear the Word of God, where it is interpreted, and applied with moſt tendency to the converſion of Souls, though he doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ultimately, and efficiently, yet he doth much, in a way of means in order to his drawing unto Chriſt. This is the firſt way.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As a man may hinder the <hi>drawings of God, by quenching the motions of the holy Spirit, and giving a deaf ear to the knocks of it, or delaying its obedience to them, ſuffering vain company, or world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cares to choke the motions of the Spirit, and wear out the impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the word:</hi> ſo he may <hi>further them</hi> by <hi>favouring</hi> them, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining ſuch impreſſions,</hi> and <hi>whetting the word upon his heart.</hi> There is ſcarce any perſon who is a conſtant attender upon the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the word, but at ſome time ot other will find ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe more than ordinarily affecting him, and making ſome more than ordinary impreſſions upon him, now if when a man findeth this, he endeavoureth to ſtifle this conviction, or wear off this impreſſion, and to work his Soul out of the trouble of it, he hereby oppoſeth and reſiſteth the drawings of Divine Grace. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> the other ſide, if he withdraws himſelf, fits alone, medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tateth upon what he hath heard, ſearcheth the Scriptures to ſee if it be according to what is revealed there, and when worldly buſineſs would put it out of his thoughts, if he endeavours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to bring it to his remembrance, and ſetcheth it again into his thoughts, deſiring it may have its perfect work. This man now doth what in him lieth to promove divine drawings.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="312" facs="tcp:61084:161" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Thirdly, As a man or woman may hinder God's drawings, <hi>by walking contrary to his or her Light:</hi> So they may <hi>promove them, by walking up to their Light and Power.</hi> The Soul that is drawn to Chriſt is alive, and yet dead: <hi>Alive</hi> as a <hi>natural</hi> rational Soul, dead as to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs.</hi> And this anſwereth an <hi>obvious</hi> and ordinary Objection, <hi>viz. What can a dead Soul do?</hi> The Anſwer is eaſie, it <hi>can do nothing</hi> ſo far as it is dead; but though the natural man be <hi>ſpiritually dead,</hi> yet conſidered as a man, a rational creature, he is alive; and though he can do nothing that is <hi>ſpiritually good,</hi> becauſe he is <hi>dead in ſin;</hi> yet he may do ſomething that is <hi>morally, and rationally good,</hi> becauſe he is <hi>rationally alive,</hi> and under the power and conduct of reaſon in a great meaſure. He hath ſome <hi>Natural Light;</hi> he hath a further <hi>revealed Light</hi> by and in the Goſpel; and though he hath not a power to live up to all <hi>the Light</hi> which the Goſpel ſhews him; yet he hath a power to ſin againſt that Light, to which he might walk up, and of which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he might make a better improvement. It is very poſſible, and too too ordinary for men when God draws one way, to ſuffer their paſſions, their vile af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and luſts, to draw another; and in doing it, to triumph over their reaſon. This is highly provocative of God. There is a great queſtion about the power and freedom of man's will by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Sober Divines ſay, the <hi>unregenerate man</hi> hath no power, no <hi>freedom</hi> to what is <hi>truly, and ſpiritually good.</hi> If any power, or free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom may be allowed to the unrenewed will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> certainly it is moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to aſſert it at ſuch a time, when the Holy Spirit moveth moſt ſtrongly, by its <hi>impulſes</hi> and <hi>convictions.</hi> The unregenerate man at ſuch a time more than another hath in his power to reſiſt his luſts and motions to ſin, and give up himſelf to God; if he will now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt this Light, and not to his power uſe this help, he thereby hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth God's drawings. Suppoſe a man in a Pir, and weak, and not able to get out; ſome ſtrength he hath while he lies ſtill, to hold back, but none to raiſe himſelf upward, to get out: When a Cord is faſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about him, if inſtead of yielding himſelf, he holds back what he can; this man now hinders the charitable drawing that others more ſtrong would lend him.</p>
               <p>Fourthly and laſtly, <hi>Pray to God that he would draw you out of the horrible Pit, and miry Clay.</hi> It is the Holy Spirit that draweth; and Chriſt tells us, that <hi>he giveth the Holy Spirit to thoſe that ask him.</hi> But I ſhall turn my diſcourſe to the Children of God, and ſhew them what is their duty, upon the conſideration of this truth; That no
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:61084:161"/>
Soul, unleſs drawn by God, either comes to, or runneth after Chriſt I ſhall open it in ſeveral particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, This Doctrine calleth to all who apprehend themſelves to be <hi>come to Chriſt, to examine their Calling,</hi> whether it be ſuch as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to a <hi>Divine Drawing;</hi> whether there be any thing wrought in your Souls, which <hi>fleſh and blood</hi> could not reveal to you; any thing more than could be the effect of the <hi>will of the fleſh,</hi> or <hi>the will of man.</hi> I have before enlarged upon this Theme, ſhewing you, how you may know whether your Faith be <hi>a Faith of the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of God.</hi> The work of God upon your Souls with power. Whether what you take to be Holineſs, be the Sanctification of the Spirit. You have heard that there is an <hi>Aſſent to the Goſpel,</hi> which may be given upon meer humane teſtimony, or upon <hi>probable Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Reaſon;</hi> neither of which is true Faith; that there may be a <hi>Moral Righteouſneſs,</hi> and a formal courſe of performing Religious Duties; neither of which amount to the <hi>Sanctification of the Spirit,</hi> or <hi>a running after Chriſt</hi> upon his <hi>drawings.</hi> I ſhall here only add, that there are two or three things which may draw men to ſome <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of life,</hi> though Chriſt draweth not.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The intereſts of mens bodily lives, and healths, and eſtates.</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, Sobriety, Chaſtity, are Virtues, in the practice of which men are concerned, as to theſe; and though indeed luſts have ſo far fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented in ſome debaucht perſons, that theſe intereſts will not draw them to ſuch a Reformation, yet in many who have not been taint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a vitious Education, and in whom cuſtom hath not begot a ſecond nature, theſe concerns will draw much, as to which aactions <hi>Grace</hi> comes not in, (I mean ſpecial Grace<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>) further than to direct men to do them from a Principle of <hi>Faith, Love,</hi> and <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Will of God,</hi> and with <hi>an aim at glorifying God.</hi>
               </p>

The Phariſees ſought the <hi>praiſe of men,</hi> rather than <hi>that of God;</hi> and indeed this is the general cauſe of Hypocriſie. This happens more generally when Religion is in faſhion and credit with the world. I might inſtance in ſeveral other things, but theſe are ſufficient. Try therefore and examine your Souls, and reſt not till you find what may evidence to you, that you are indeed <hi>drawn by Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>This Doctrine calls to all the People of God for Humility;</hi> indeed it evidenceth <hi>Humility</hi> a neceſſary ingredient into Saintſhip. A proud Child of God is a contradiction. <hi>Grace</hi> leaves the Soul no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to boaſt in, nothing to be proud of Is he come to Chriſt? He had never come, if the Father had not drawn him: Doth he <hi>run</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him faſter than another? he had never run, if he had not been drawn. There were ſome in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> who were puf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed up, who deſpiſed <hi>Paul,</hi> and thought of themſelves above what they ought to think; <hi>they were full, they were rich, they had need of nothing.</hi> Obſerve the Argument by which the Apoſtle humbleth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 7. <hi>Who hath made thee to differ from another?</hi> Or, <hi>What haſt thou which thou haſt not received? And if thou haſt received it, why doſt thou glory as if thou hadſt not received it?</hi> Art thou <hi>come to Chriſt?</hi> and is not thy neighbour? What follows from hence, but (as the Apoſtle to the <hi>Romans</hi> ſaith) that to thee God hath been more good, to him more ſevere. Haſt thou come of thy ſelf, or in thy own ſtrength? Chriſt hoth told us; <hi>That no man cometh to the Son, but he whom the Father draweth. Every one as he is learned and taught of the Father, cometh unto the Son.</hi> He who is not drawn, is the object of thy pity, and deſerveth thy prayers, thy good counſel and exhortations, all the help thou canſt give him; but thou haſt no reaſon to triumph, or boaſt, or glory over him; had not the Lord drawn thee, thou hadſt been in the ſame circumſtances that he, as as much a ſtranger to Chriſt as he is. It is grace, ſpecial grace which alone maketh the difference betwixt thee and him. Doſt thou find thy ſelf more ſtrong and able than another to reſiſt a motion to ſin, whether from the luſts of thy own heart, or from the ſuggeſtions of of the Devil, or from the World? Thou ſtandeſt when another is overcome and falleth. Doſt thou find more ability to ſpiritual du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, more freedom and livelineſs in the performance of them? ſtill all this is from grace: Without Chriſt thou couldeſt do nothing; thou haſt no reaſon to glory, becauſe what thou haſt is received; what thou doſt is by grace, which thou haſt received. <hi>I live</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul, Gul.</hi> 2. 20.) <hi>yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me, and the life which I</hi>
                  <pb n="315" facs="tcp:61084:162"/>
                  <hi>now live in the fleſh, I live by the Faith of the Son of God.</hi> So as the Child of God hath nothing to glory in, nothing to boaſt and triumph over his weaker Brother; for, if he differs, it is grace alone makes him to differ.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This notion calleth upon the People of God <hi>to bleſs the Lord, if at any time they find their hearts more inabled to run after God,</hi> Pſal. 18. 29. <hi>By thee</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) I have run, or I have broken through a Troop; and by my God have I leaped over a wall. David</hi> owns there to God his Victory over his fleſhly enemies; but a Chriſtian's Warfare is more ſpiritual, againſt <hi>Principalities and Powers,</hi> againſt ſpiritual Enemies, mighty Temptations, ſtrong Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to ſin; doth he at any time get a Victory againſt them? cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly he is obliged to give God the glory, for it is by him that he breaketh through the Troops of the Prince of darkneſs. Hath he dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult duties to perform, and hath he found a ſtrength to perform them, ſtill the glory is due unto God; for by him he <hi>leapeth over the wall.</hi> It is an expreſſion of <hi>David</hi>'s, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 87. 7. <hi>All my ſprings are in thee.</hi> Our ſpiritual life is maintained from many ſprings. A ſpring of <hi>pardoning grace,</hi> becauſe of our renewing guilt. A ſpring of renewing and ſanctifying grace, becauſe of the frequent <hi>luſtings of the fleſh againſt the Spirit,</hi> and our being brought ſo often <hi>into a captivity to the Law of our members.</hi> Springs of <hi>ſtrengthening, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening, comforting grace,</hi> becauſe of accidents which weaken our ſtrength, make us dull and heavy in the ſervice of God, and often <hi>to walk in the dark, and ſee no light.</hi> Now all our freſh ſprings are in Chriſt; whither then but to God ſhould we go with our homage, for any influence of grace received? God laid it to the charge of the <hi>Iſraelites, Hoſ.</hi> 2. 8. that <hi>they did not know that he gave them their Corn, and Wine, and Oil, and Silver, and Gold.</hi> Great evils followed this ignorance. 1. <hi>God had not that glory which was due unto him for it.</hi> 2 They made <hi>an ill uſe of them,</hi> they <hi>multiplied them for</hi> Baal. 3. They <hi>by this means provoked God to deprive them of thoſe mercies.</hi> Thoſe who do not know, that is, do not believe that their freſh ſprings of grace are from God, cannot give God the glory of them, nor will think themſelves ſo concerned, to uſe them for the honour and glory of God; the not doing of which will provoke God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

God. What have they to praiſe God for, ſaving only for making them reaſonable creatures, and ſo leaving them to the power and freedom of their own natural faculties?</p>
               <p>Fourthly and laſtly, This notion calleth upon all the Children of God to <hi>eye</hi> and to <hi>uſe Chriſt, as the fountain both of their ſpiritual life and ſtrength.</hi> Chriſt is the <hi>All</hi> in <hi>all</hi> to, and in all his Saints. He is the <hi>Lord their Righteouſneſs,</hi> that is, their <hi>All</hi> as to <hi>Juſtification:</hi> The <hi>Lord their ſtrength,</hi> that is, as to <hi>Sanctification,</hi> and in Heaven he will alſo be to them <hi>All</hi> in <hi>All.</hi> They ſhall be <hi>ever with the Lord:</hi> that's their <hi>All in Heaven.</hi> But here is our infirmity, that we do not <hi>eye Chriſt</hi> in this notion. Hence our <hi>doubts,</hi> and <hi>fears,</hi> becauſe of our guilt of ſin, and imperfection in duty; hence our deſpondencies as to the Promiſes, if our Souls be but a little ſpiritually ſick, we propheſie to our ſelves no leſs than ſpiritual death. We ſhall one day die by the hand of our tempter, or by the power of our luſts. Here we do not act like our Father <hi>Abraham;</hi> he did not conſider the dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his own body, nor the deadneſs of <hi>Sarah</hi>'s womb; he ſtaggered not at the Promiſe through unbelief. We conſider only the frame and temper of our own hearts, and what they are able to produce; we conſider not what God is able to perform, nor yet his Promiſe, which enſureth his willingneſs, that he might be faithful. <hi>Fear not</hi> (ſaid God to his People) <hi>for I am with thee; be not diſmaid, for I am thy God, I will ſtrengthen thee, and uphold thee with the hand of my Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> Iſa. 41. 10. &amp; v. 14. <hi>Fear not thou worm</hi> Jacob, <hi>and you men of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>for I am thy Redeemer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Uſe him as the fountain both of your life and ſtrength.</hi> It is with the <hi>ſpiritual life</hi> of the Soul, as with the <hi>natural life</hi> of the Body; both of them are from <hi>God's breathings:</hi> The firſt is from the <hi>breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of his more common providence;</hi> the ſecond from the <hi>breathings of his more ſpecial grace,</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual influence:</hi> And in the like manner, as the former is alſo preſerved, and maintained by God upholding our faculties, and the virtues in our meat to nouriſh, in our phyſick to heal us, and keeping off thoſe accidents, which would ruine and deſtroy us; uſe him therefore as the principle and fountain of your life:</p>

omiſſion and neglect of due means, but from the due uſe of them, God concurreth with our endeavours, and uſe of means, though he putteth forth an influence in order to the effect, beyond the bare ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the means: ſo as to our ſpiritual life, the neceſſity of Chriſts influence in order to the preſerving, and upholding it, doth not infer a needleſneſs of our uſe of ſuch means as he hath inſtituted, in order to that end, it only teacheth us not to truſt in the means alone, but to look beyond them unto Chriſt. Every gracious Soul hath in itſelf a principle of ſpiritual life, as every living Body hath in it a principle of natural life, but as the Soul in the Body of a man may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in its operations, ſo the Soul may be clog'd in its ſpiritual operations, hindered by luſts, and corruptions, hindered by ſtrong temptations and motions to ſin; theſe may make the Soul ſtumble and fall, they may make it dull, heavy and inactive, weak, and ſad, and dejected; here is need of Chriſts <hi>further drawings,</hi> in order to it we muſt cry unto him, we muſt lie in the way in which he uſeth to meet Souls with ſuch diſpenſations.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Keep up in your Souls a dependency upon Chriſt, without diſtruſt and unbelief;</hi> when you cannot live upon the ſenſe of ſtrengthening, quickning, conſolatory influences, yet <hi>live upon faith,</hi> as to them; God is never ſo much honoured as when he is truſted, when his Servants live a dependent life upon him, for whatſoever he hath promiſed.

               <p>I Have done with the Spouſe's Petition, <hi>Draw me.</hi> I now come to the Argument, or her Promiſe, <hi>And we will run after thee.</hi> She begg'd her Beloved's <hi>drawing;</hi> ſhe promiſeth her own <hi>running.</hi> From the Petition I obſerved; That the Soul muſt be firſt <hi>drawn, before it will come to, or run after Chriſt.</hi> This I have diſcourſed largely. I come now to the ſecond <hi>Propoſition</hi> I raiſed from theſe words:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> That the gracious Soul being firſt drawn, will run after Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Till it be <hi>drawn,</hi> it will not, it cannot run; when once drawn, it will run. This <hi>Propoſition</hi> I ſhall open, prove, and apply. In the Explication I have only the term <hi>running</hi> to open. I opened the term <hi>draw</hi> largely in my Diſcourſe upon the former <hi>Propoſition,</hi> where I told you it ſignified, <hi>a powerful gracious influence of the Holy Spirit upon the Soul, perſuading, alluring, and commanding the Soul's Obedience.</hi> It is an act both <hi>ſweet,</hi> and <hi>powerful.

So as my meaning is, that when God hath once, by the ſweet and powerful influence of his Spirit upon the Soul of a man, <hi>allured, perſuaded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and commanded the Soul</hi> to its duty, then it will <hi>run after him.</hi> The only queſtion to be ſpoken to is, what is meant by <hi>Running.</hi> When I opened the Text, I told you of ſeveral things imported by this term, I ſhall now more largely diſcourſe them</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Running</hi> implieth <hi>willingneſs</hi> to the <hi>motion.</hi> It implieth <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and ſo is oppoſed to <hi>lying,</hi> or <hi>ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="319" facs="tcp:61084:164"/>
                  <hi>Auguſtine, Certum eſt nos velle, quum volumus, agere quum agimur.</hi> It is (ſaith he) certain, that we <hi>will,</hi> when we are <hi>made willing,</hi> that <hi>we act,</hi> when we <hi>are acted, ſed ille facit ut velimus,</hi> it is God that maketh us to be willing. He giveth <hi>to will and to do.</hi> Men may run, that are not originally willing, it is a miſchief that they fear, which makes them run, but yet even then they move <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly,</hi> though it be a danger imminent upon them, which maketh them ſo willing. But this motion is a much ſweeter motion, they are <hi>made willing</hi> firſt, and then they move out of choice, willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: until the Soul be renewed, and changed, it moveth not at all toward God, it may move to natural actions, from that principle of <hi>natural life,</hi> of which it is poſſeſſed. It may move to moral actions, from that principle of life which every <hi>reaſonable Soul</hi> is poſſeſſed of. But it moveth not to any truly ſpiritual actions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it wanteth a principle of <hi>Spiritual life.</hi> But this being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed in regeneration, <hi>to will being given unto it,</hi> it moveth in the ways of God, and that from a principle within itſelf. <hi>You</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 1.) <hi>hath he quickned, who were dead in treſpaſſes and ſins.</hi> It moveth not, as a meer <hi>Machine,</hi> or <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument,</hi> from the <hi>power</hi> and <hi>force</hi> of a forreign agent, but as a <hi>living creature,</hi> from itſelf, and a principle within itſelf. Yet not without a <hi>divine influence,</hi> look as it is in natural motions, though they flow from a <hi>a principle of life in a man,</hi> yet they are not without an <hi>influence</hi> of more <hi>ordinary common providence,</hi> uphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding our natural faculties; hence the Apoſtle ſaith of God, <hi>in him we live, move and have our being:</hi> So it is as to our Spiritual motions, the Soul moveth from the principles of Spiritual life infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed into it, from the principles of the new creature, but yet not without the <hi>influence of the Spirit of Grace upon it,</hi> upholding thoſe habits of Grace, which are infuſed into the Soul, and exciting it to, and aſſiſting of it in Spiritual actions. <hi>Without me</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>you can do nothing.</hi> he doth not ſay, without me you cannot do much, or you cannot do great things, but you can do nothing. But yet to <hi>will</hi> is preſent with the Soul, yea and to do, though it hath no ſtrength to do what it would. And as the Soul hath need of a daily influence of Grace, in its ordinary courſe of <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual action,</hi> ſo it hath need of more ſpecial and powerful influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, when it meets with a <hi>work more difficult,</hi> for (ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle) 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>We are not ſufficient to think one good thought</hi>
                  <pb n="320" facs="tcp:61084:165"/>
                  <hi>as of our ſelves, for now our ſufficiency is from God.</hi> This is now <hi>Gratia co-operans,</hi> co-operating Grace, in the exerciſes of which we are not <hi>mcerly paſſive,</hi> as in the <hi>reception</hi> of the firſt Grace; as it was with the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in their journey towards <hi>Canaan, Numb.</hi> 9. 17. 18. &amp;c. They kept pace with the <hi>Cloud,</hi> and with the <hi>Pillar of fire,</hi> when the <hi>Cloud moved, they moved, when the Cloud ſtood ſtill, they ſtood ſtill. At the Commandment of the Lord they journied, and at the Commandment of the Lord they pitched, as long as the Cloud abode upon the Tabernacle, they reſted in their Tents. And when the Cloud tarried long, upon the Tabernacle many days, then they—journied not.</hi> So it is with ſuch as are Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites indeed, in their ſpiritual motions toward the <hi>new Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> the City of God. If the Grace of God aſſiſts not, they move not, and according to the degree of its influence, they move more, or leſs. But yet they move, and willingly move, though not without the co-operating and aſſiſting Grace of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, <hi>Running</hi> implyeth <hi>ſtrength in the motion,</hi> thus it is oppoſed to <hi>creeping,</hi> or <hi>walking ſaintly.</hi> The weak man may creep, and go ſlowly, but he cannot run. When the Lord draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, the Soul will not only move towards God, and that <hi>freely</hi> and <hi>willingly,</hi> but it will move <hi>ſtrongly;</hi> it will find ſtrength a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſin, and ſtrength unto duties, <hi>Job.</hi> 17. 9. <hi>The righteous man will hold on in his way, and he that is of clean hanas ſhall grow ſtronger, and ſtronger.</hi> God commandeth that we ſhould <hi>love h m with all our ſtrength,</hi> Luk. 10. 27. When the Lord draweth the Soul, then it runneth with all its ſtrength, loveth God with a love that is <hi>ſtronger than the Grave;</hi> then it believeth with a <hi>ſtrong ſaith,</hi> and obeyeth with a <hi>perfect heart.</hi> While God was preſent with <hi>Sampſon,</hi> though they tied his Hair to a Beam, and ſhut up the Gates of the City, he could carry away <hi>Beam</hi> and <hi>Gates,</hi> though he had no more then the jaw-bone of an Aſs, he could with it ſlay a thouſand men, when God was departed from him, he could not get out of his Enemies hands, though he had no ſuch oppoſition; when a Soul finds the power and preſence of Divine Grace, though it hath ſtrong corruptions, and meet with ſtrong Temptations, yet they are all nothing to it, it eaſily over all becomes <hi>more than Conqueror. Peter</hi> at one time, at the command of Chriſt, walks to him upon the Sea, at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time wanting the ſame ſpecial aſſiſtance, is overcome by a ſilly Maid in the High Prieſts Hall; the oppoſite Temptation was
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:61084:165"/>
much the ſame in both caſes, <hi>viz.</hi> from the <hi>ſear of his life,</hi> which was in as apparent danger from the <hi>Sea,</hi> as from the Enemies in the Hall of the High Prieſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Running argues <hi>ſpeed,</hi> ſo it is oppoſed to <hi>walking</hi> a foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pace, or ſtep by ſtep. When the Soul is by God drawn unto him, and wants not his co-operating Grace drawing him after him, it will not only move towards God, and that with ſtrength, and courage, but it will move with <hi>nimbleneſs</hi> and <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs.</hi> As it is with the body ſometimes, though it hath its u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual ſtrength, and be able to work as uſually, yet it is ſeized with a torpor, and lazineſs, there is a dulneſs, and inactivity up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it: So it is with the Soul, its Spiritual diſtemper many times, is not ſo much a weakneſs, as a ſpiritual deadneſs, dulneſs, and inactivity, ſo as it wants a promptneſs, and readineſs to its duty: It cannot ſay with <hi>David, My heart is ready O God, my heart is ready, I will pray and ſing Praiſe. Running</hi> argues the abſence of this ill temper. If the Lord draweth the Soul, it will not only ſerve him, but it will ſerve him with a ready mind, and free Spirit; praiſe and duty will wait for God in the Soul; it will not only walk, but <hi>run the ways of Gods Commandments. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> hath an expreſſion to this purpoſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 60. <hi>I made haſt, and delayed not to keep thy Commandments.</hi> Every Soul that loves God keepeth the Commandments of God, it is the teſt of our love to God. <hi>He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them</hi> (ſaith Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 14 21.) <hi>he it is that loveth me.</hi> But there is a great deal of difference in mens keeping, and fulfilling the commandments of God. The meaneſt, weakeſt <hi>Chriſtian</hi> doth in his meaſure keep the Lords commandments, all the commandments of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 6. <hi>Then</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) ſhall I not be aſhamed, when I have a reſpect to all thy Commandments.</hi> He that hath the leaſt of ſaving Grace, ſets the law of the Lord in his Eye, and makes the word of God a <hi>light to his feet,</hi> and a <hi>Lanthorn to his paths,</hi> and hath a reverence and regard to all the commandments of God, and <hi>To will is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with him,</hi> he would walk perfectly with God, but in many things he doth offend, through weakneſs, and in many things through a dulneſs, and heavineſs which ſometimes doth affect, and afflict his Soul, he doth not only want a <hi>ſtrength</hi> to perform, but he wants a life, and quickneſs of Spirit in what he doth, but now if the Lord draweth, the Soul <hi>makes haſt and delayeth not</hi>
                  <pb n="322" facs="tcp:61084:166"/>
                  <hi>to keep the Commandments of God. Jacob</hi> himſelf had forgot the vow which he had made unto God, when he fled from the face of his <hi>Brother Eſau;</hi> God <hi>draweth him,</hi> ſaith unto him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 35. 1. <hi>Ariſe go up to Bethel, make there an Altar to God,</hi> &amp;c. then <hi>Jacob</hi> made haſt, and <hi>delayed not, v.</hi> 2. When there is a ſuſpenſion of this <hi>drawing Grace</hi> in its co-operating, and <hi>concurring influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> the Soul moves heavily, like <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Chariots; when the Wheels are taken off, it hath a view of its duty, and lieth under convictions as to it, and it may be finds ſtrength enough to the performance of it, but wants a readineſs of mind, and is ready when it hath a monition to duty from ſuch as wiſh well to it, to ſay as he ſaid to Paul, <hi>Go thy way, when I am at leiſure I will ſend for thee.</hi> Or <hi>tomorrow,</hi> or <hi>at ſuch or ſuch a time I will do it;</hi> as the young man in the Goſpel whom Chriſt bid <hi>follow him,</hi> ſaid, <hi>ſuffer me firſt to go and bury my dead;</hi> So ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Soul is ready to ſay, ſuffer me firſt to go, and do ſuch or ſuch a thing. So the Soul is ready to delay and put off good motions, but when the <hi>Lord draweth,</hi> then it <hi>maketh haſt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layeth not to keep his Commandments.</hi> It longeth for times of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. It is glad when they ſay unto it, <hi>Come, let us go up to the Houſe of the Lord,</hi> it ſayeth, when ſhall <hi>I come and appear before God?</hi> There is a time when the Soul ſaith, <hi>when will the Sabbath come, the hour of Prayer come, that I may appear before God, and pour out my Soul before him?</hi> This is now when God draweth hard, when the Spirit of God cometh upon the Soul, in a more than ordinary influence: and there is a time when the Soul ſaith, <hi>when will the Sabbath he gone, the hour of duty be run out?</hi> This is when the Lord doth not <hi>draw</hi> in ſuch a manner. The believing Soul like the flowers, <hi>opens</hi> or <hi>ſhuts,</hi> as the Sun of righteouſneſs ſhineth more or leſs upon it. Let me again allude to that Text, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65. 1. <hi>Praiſe watteth for God in Zion.</hi> Praiſe is a rent due from our Souls to God, we farm much mercy from the great Landlord of all good, <hi>Praiſe</hi> is all the rent we pay. Now look as it is in the world, a bad tenant never hath his rent ready ſo it is with a bad Man, he lives upon mercy, and it may be hath liberal portions of mercy, but God never hears of him to pay his acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. A good Tenant, if the times be good, hath alwaies his rent ready for his Landlord, ſo as his rent <hi>waiteth</hi> for his Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord: but if the times be bad, even the beſt Tenants, though they have an heart to pay their rent, yet may not have it to
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:61084:166"/>
pay, their Landlords may wait for their rents; ſo it is with the beſt Souls. If the Sun of righteouſneſs ſhines out clearly upon them, and the Spirit of Grace draweth powerfully, Praiſe waiteth for God in their Souls. If not, God may <hi>wait</hi> for his <hi>Praiſes.</hi> Hence <hi>David</hi> ſo often prayeth. <hi>Quicken me according to thy word,</hi> Pſal. 119. 25. <hi>Quicken me in thy way,</hi> v. 37. <hi>Quicken me in thy righteouſneſs,</hi> v. 40.</p>

                  <hi>I have now opened the term</hi> Run. <hi>The Propoſition opened lies thus before you,</hi> That the Soul of a Chriſtian, once drawn not only by the motives and arguments of the Goſpel improved by the gifts of Gods Miniſter, but by the ſecret, and powerful influence of the Spirit of God upon it, doth no longer lie ſtill (as the Soul dead in ſin) nor move from a forreign power put forth upon it, but from an inward principle within itſelf, and that not weakly and impotently, but with might and ſtrength, and that not dully, and heavily, but with life, freedom, ſpeed, and chearfulneſs, after God in the way of its du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, keeping the Commandments of God with its whole heart; <hi>being firſt made willing it willeth, being firſt</hi> ſet on work, <hi>it</hi> worketh, <hi>yet not of itſelf meerly nor principally.</hi> I live <hi>(ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle)</hi> yet not I, <hi>but</hi> Chriſt liveth in me, <hi>and the</hi> life which I now live, I live by the faith of the Son of God. I can do all things <hi>(ſaith the ſame Apoſtle to the</hi> Philippians) through Chriſt that ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theneth me, and without me you can do nothing, <hi>ſaith Chriſt to his Diſciples,</hi> Joh. <hi>14. 3.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The truth of this further appears from Gods Peoples promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of running upon Gods drawing, in that excellent 119 <hi>Pſal.</hi> you ſhall find many paſſages of this tendency. <hi>v.</hi> 32. <hi>I will run the ways of thy Commandments, when thou ſhalt inlarge myheart.</hi> 33 <hi>Teach me O Lord the way of thy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Statutes, and I ſhall keep it unto the end.</hi> v. 34. <hi>Give me underſtanding, and I ſhall keep thy Law, yea I ſhall obſerve it with my whole heart,</hi> v. 35. <hi>Make me to go in the paths of thy Commandments.</hi> v. 36. <hi>Incline my heart to thy teſtimonies. The inlarging of the heart,</hi> his prayer for giving <hi>him underſtanding, making him to go in the paths of Gods Commandments,</hi> &amp;c. are but all ſeveral phraſes, expreſſive of the drawing influences of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace,</hi> which are followed with the promiſes of <hi>running, keeping Gods Commandments,</hi> yea, <hi>keeping them with his whole heart, keeping them to the end.</hi> So v. 7. <hi>I will praiſe thee with up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs of heart, when I ſhall have learned thy righteous Judgments.</hi> So v. 41. <hi>Let thy mercies come unto me, even thy ſalvation,</hi> v. 44. <hi>So ſhall I keep thy law continually.</hi>

What needs any further proof of this than what every good Chriſtian hath from its own experience? Who is there that walks with God, that alwaies finds the ſame ſpiritual temper? that doth not find, that he cannot at ſometimes do as he can, and doth do at other times? Every good Chriſtian finds the ſame <hi>willing</hi> at all times. To will is alwaies preſent with him; but who finds the ſame degree of ſtrength, the ſame readineſs, and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of Spirit in Gods ſervice at all times? Now from whence is this, if not from the inequal drawings of Divine Grace? if the Soul be drawn ſtrongly, then is it ſtrong, if weakly, it mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth accordingly. Being drawn, then it runs. Being at firſt drawn to Chriſt, it moves, being <hi>further drawn,</hi> it runs.</p>
               <p>The reaſon of this lieth. 1. Partly in the Souls <hi>renewed na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> 2. <hi>Partly in the nature of ſpecial Divine Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>All motion is from a principle of life.</hi> Natural motion from a Natural life, Spiritual motion from the Spiritual life, and the truly Spiritual motion is as much an indication of a <hi>Spiritual life</hi> that principleth it, as the <hi>Natural motion</hi> is an indication of that Natural life from which it floweth, and the Spiritual motion is as much the neceſſary effect of a principle of Spiritual life, as the Natural motion is the neceſſary effect of a Natural life. So as the Soul being once quickned by the quickning Spirit, cannot but move in its Spiritual motions. But look as it is in the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral motions, ſome motion muſt attend all natural life, yet it is more or leſs, more or leſs ſtrong, or weak, and there is a more or leſs chearfulneſs, and readineſs, attends the motion of the natural body, as the faculties of the Soul that animates it, are more or leſs upheld by the influence of Divine Providence, and the incumbrances of that life are more kept off by the power of Divine Providence: So it is as to our Spiritual life, there is in that Soul that is once drawn to Chriſt, and ſo alive to God, a <hi>ſeed of God abiding,</hi> which is a conſtant principle of life, and is alwaies working, and moving to, and in its proper operations, but yet theſe motions are more or leſs ſtrong, free, and chearful, according to the influence of the holy Spirit of God, and the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings of it in the Soul, which being a free agent, ſometimes puts it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf forth more, ſometimes leſs, &amp; according to that are the Souls motions either more quick and chearful, or more dull and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, but being once drawn to Chriſt, it <hi>moves,</hi> and moves willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from a principle within itſelf, being made willing it willeth,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:61084:167"/>
and chuſeth the things that pleaſe God, though it muſt be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther drawn before it <hi>runneth.</hi> It requires no more than a renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſanctified heart to move for and towards God, but it requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth an <hi>inlarged heart,</hi> to run after God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, It will yet further appear from the <hi>Nature of Divine Grace,</hi> in its <hi>ſpecial ſaving operations.</hi> There are thoſe who will acknowledge no Grace but <hi>exciting Grace</hi> in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of the Goſpel, and preſſing the Grace of it by thoſe gifts which God hath for that end given to his Miniſters, whatſoever elſe is done in the Soul, they will have to flow <hi>from the power of mans will, leſt free to good or evil;</hi> but we ſay this is not enough, there muſt alſo be a <hi>working Grace,</hi> applied to the Soul in <hi>conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> and a <hi>co-working Grace,</hi> which is neceſſary to the Soul after converſion. Now all <hi>ſpecial Grace,</hi> whether it be <hi>operans,</hi> or <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operans,</hi> that which we call working, or that which we call <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>working,</hi> is effective; thoſe who will own nothing but an <hi>exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Grace,</hi> allow it no proper effect upon the Soul, for if it be productive of an effect, it is more than <hi>exciting.</hi> Now here indeed lies the difference betwixt <hi>common</hi> and <hi>ſpecial Grace,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Grace that <hi>bringeth ſalvation,</hi> and that which only <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth and offereth Salvation.</hi> The firſt is alway <hi>effective of its end,</hi> the latter is <hi>never effective,</hi> but is determined in the exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and offer of good, which man is left to his own freedom, and choice whether he will accept yea or no, which being admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it is not poſſible but that the Soul once drawn by it, muſt run, or rather will run, for now it moves from the inward prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of a renewed nature, and if <hi>working ſpecial Grace</hi> be eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective, and faileth not in its <hi>operations</hi> upon the unrenewed Soul, it is much more effective of its end in the Soul that is changed, and renewed where it is but <hi>aſſiſtant</hi> to the <hi>renewed nature,</hi> ſo as the Soul being drawn, <hi>will run,</hi> Firſt, From that principle of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual life which is in the <hi>renewed nature</hi> alwaies a principle of ſome motion, though ſometimes more, and ſometimes leſs; and Secondly, From the <hi>powerful aſſiſtance</hi> of that <hi>ſpecial Grace</hi> which God puts forth upon the Soul in its <hi>renewed ſtate,</hi> helping it over thoſe mountains of difficulties which ſometimes it meets with, and removing thoſe ſtumbling blocks, which <hi>corruption,</hi> and the <hi>malignity</hi> of the <hi>world,</hi> or its <hi>grand adverſary,</hi> oft-times layeth in its way. I have thus far opened the propoſition, I ſhall now apply it. Firſt,</p>

                  <note place="margin">Uſe 1.</note> 1. By way of <hi>Caution. Blindneſs</hi> is a great Mother of boldneſs and confidence, and <hi>Love</hi> is the Mother of jealouſy and ſuſpicion, hence it is, that the natural man knowing nothing of ſpiritual things, nor underſtanding the ſtate of the Soul by nature, nor the workings of God in the Soul, turning it from ſin unto God, ſeldom or never examineth, or queſtioneth his ſtate. The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſtian fulleſt of <hi>Love,</hi> for God, finds difficulty to ſatisfy himſelf as to his <hi>Spiritual ſtate.</hi> The firſt concludeth himſelf ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiciently drawn, becauſe he ſits under the preaching of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and finds ſometimes ſome good motions, and impreſſions, whether he obeyeth them or no, whether he be turned into the likeneſs of the Goſpel, yea or no. The other, though he doth find his heart <hi>renewed,</hi> and <hi>changed,</hi> tho he doth find, that <hi>to will is preſent with him,</hi> yet becauſe he wanteth <hi>ſtrength to perform,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he doth not find at all times, that promptneſs, and readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mind, that freedom, activity and chearfulneſs of Spirit, which he thinks he hath ſometimes found, and which he ſeeth others triumph, and rejoice in, queſtioneth whether he was drawn, yea or no. Now ſuch a Soul ought to diſtinguiſh,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Betwixt a <hi>being drawn to Chriſt,</hi> and a <hi>being drawn after Chriſt.</hi> It is true, there is no Soul that is drawn to Chriſt, but <hi>ſhall be drawn after him,</hi> but yet theſe are two things, both the acts of ſpecial, powerful Grace, but yet in a different kind, and degree.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly. <hi>Betwixt a real drawing after him,</hi> and a <hi>gradual drawing.</hi> I told you before that all Divine <hi>drawing</hi> ſignifieth a <hi>ſweet, and powerful influence of the Spirit upon the Soul, by which it is allured, changed, and melted into that duty which the Soul oweth to God in obedience to the Goſpel;</hi> now as it is in our <hi>drawing</hi> of a thing, or perſon to us, we may put forth more or leſs power as we pleaſe: So in the <hi>divine drawings,</hi> though <hi>divine drawing</hi> be a mercy of that nature, that it ſhall and will follow the Soul all the days of its life, God will never <hi>depart from the Soul</hi> to which he is thus united, to do it good, and <hi>he will put his fear into its heart, that it ſhall never depart from him;</hi> yet he puts forth more or leſs of his power, according to the good pleaſure of his own will, and the conduct of his own infinite wiſdom, and according alſo to our behaviour toward him; let me for the relief of ſuch a Soul lay down three concluſions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, I ſay <hi>there is no Soul by the Father drawn to Chriſt, but</hi>
                  <pb n="327" facs="tcp:61084:168"/>
                  <hi>that Soul is alſo, and ſhall be by the Spirit drawn after him.</hi> Upon the Souls being drawn to Chriſt, there followeth an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and the Spirit of Chriſt, and the Soul that is ſo drawn. Chriſt after that time is in the Soul, and the Soul is in Chriſt, hence his <hi>Spirit is put into their hearts, and dwelleth in them,</hi> a multitude of phraſes of that nature are to be found in holy writ. It is called an <hi>ingraſting into Chriſt.</hi> Now it is not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the Soul ſhould be ingraſted into ſuch a ſtock, but it muſt partake of the fatneſs of the ſtock, and grow up in him, the <hi>ſeed of God</hi> abiding in the Soul, it cannot but grow and ſpring up in it. Some Communion with Chriſt alwaies follows this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. So that unleſs the union with Chriſt could be wholly broken and diſſolved, its communion with Chriſt, cannot be wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted; interrupted it may be, but I ſay not wholly interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Secondly,</p>
               <p n="2">2. The leaſt influence of <hi>ſpecial Grace keeps the Soul moving for, and towards God, and in a willingneſs to ſorve and obey him, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth it from a total falling away. Papiſts</hi> ſay that we may fall away both <hi>totally,</hi> and <hi>finally, Lutherans</hi> ſay we may fall away <hi>totally,</hi> but not <hi>finally,</hi> but we ſay, <hi>the juſtified Soul can neither fall away totally, nor yet finally,</hi> if he could fall away <hi>totally,</hi> the union betwixt Chriſt and the Soul, muſt be diſſolved, or the <hi>union</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, the communion conſequent to that union might be wholly interrupted, neither of which can be.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But Thirdly, The holy Spirit dwelling in the Souls of Believers, and working in them <hi>putteth forth its power, ſometimes more, ſometimes leſs,</hi> as a free agent, and according to the good pleaſure of his own will, <hi>as is the drawing, ſo is the running.</hi> Hence the Soul moveth, ſometimes with more, ſometimes with leſſer ſtrength, ſometimes with more promptneſs, and readineſs, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with leſs, as the holy Spirit is pleaſed more or leſs to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert and put forth his power, in, and upon the Soul. Now from this diſcourſe it appeareth, that a Soul that findeth that God hath renewed, and changed it ſo far, that to will is preſent with it, and it hath an heart to do, though it wanteth ſuch a ſtrength, ſuch a freedom to, and chearfulneſs in duty, as others rejoice in, and itſelf hath ſometimes found, yet hath no reaſon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that it was never truly drawn to Chriſt, becauſe as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth it is not <hi>drawn after him,</hi> all the evidence of which that it hath, is becauſe it doth not run as at other times; all this
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:61084:169"/>
may be, yet the Soul may be truly drawn to him, and alſo <hi>drawn after him,</hi> though not ſo <hi>powerfully</hi> as it may be it hath felt it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, at other times, or ſeen others drawn.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Uſe 2.</note> In the ſecond place, This notion may inform us. <hi>That a run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning after Chriſt is the duty of a Chriſtian.</hi> The life of a Child of God is in Scripture, ordinarily expreſſed under the notion of a <hi>walking with God,</hi> a phraſe that ſome in this age would ſcoff at, but one of the ancienteſt by which in Scripture a courſe of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs is expreſſed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. 24. <hi>Enoch walked with God, and was not;</hi> but now if <hi>walking</hi> be taken in oppoſition to <hi>running,</hi> there is ſomething more than <hi>walking</hi> with God, the duty of a belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; even this <hi>running</hi> after Chriſt which I have been deſcribing to you. Hence it is alſo expreſſed under this notion. So the Spouſe here expreſſeth it, <hi>we will run after thee.</hi> So David, <hi>I will run the ways of thy Commandments.</hi> So St. <hi>Paul, ſo run that you may obtain,</hi> we are not only under an obligation to ſerve God, but to ſerve him with all our might, all our ſtrength, to ſerve him with <hi>readineſs,</hi> and <hi>freedom of Spirit;</hi> this is that which elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where is called a <hi>growing in Grace,</hi> and correſponds with the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> motion and pace to <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> mentioned, Pſal. 84. <hi>a going from ſtrength to ſtrength.</hi> It is a long journey that we have to go, from the <hi>minimum quodſic,</hi> the leaſt degree of Grace, to the <hi>maximum quodſic,</hi> the <hi>fulneſs of ſtature which is in Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and therefore we had need run; ſinners run in their ſinful cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Luſts get ſtrength, and diſcover their activity daily, men make haſt to be compleat in ſinning, to fill up the meaſure of their iniquities. Men make haſt to be <hi>rich in the world,</hi> and ſhall the Children of God make no haſt to be rich in Grace? <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>My Soul followeth hard after thee,</hi> Pſal. 63. 8, St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us that <hi>he preſſed forward toward the Mark,</hi> Phil. 3. 14. Ah! where are thoſe Souls of whom we can ſay they <hi>run</hi> after Chriſt. How few are thoſe Souls that <hi>follow hard after God,</hi> that go as faſt as they can, though it may be they cannot go as faſt as they would.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>How many are there in the world that appear to us as if they were moving after God, but move meerly as Machines and Ingines,</hi> they are rather <hi>moved</hi> from ſome forreign principle without them, than move from any intrinſick principle; all hypocrites, all formal profeſſors do ſo, they follow Chriſt for the Loaves, or are drawn from the conſideration of their own credit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, ſome are drawn to ſome degrees of duty, from the
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:61084:169"/>
reflections of their natural conſcience; this is now no running after God, they may do many things which God requires, but it is from no internal principle.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>How manẏ are there that inſtead of running, halt?</hi> We dare not ſay that they do not <hi>move</hi> at all, we hope their hearts are right, we hope they are the Children of <hi>Jonathan,</hi> but they are lame of their feet, with one foot they ſeem to go right, with another they fail, they are like <hi>Naaman</hi> the Syrian, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that he would ſerve God, even the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> only he deſires that the Lord would be merciful to him, as to <hi>his bowing down in the Houſe of Rimmon.</hi> They are neither <hi>uniform</hi> nor <hi>ſteady,</hi> and <hi>conſtant</hi> in their ſervice of God, they ſeem to run in publick duties, but follow them into their Families and Cloſets, there they halt. They appear like thoſe that run in duties of more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal communion with God, but halt in duties of more ſecret, heart communion with God. Nor are they <hi>conſtant;</hi> that of the Apoſtle to the <hi>Galatians</hi> is applicable to them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 7. <hi>You did run well, who hindered you?</hi> Heretofore one would have thought them in a great zeal for God, but they are grown cold, and remiſs and are very careleſs of their converſations, theſe never truly ran, though they appeared to others to have ran: at leaſt they never ran ſo as to obtain. It is ſaid, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 40. 12. <hi>That they that wait upon the Lord, ſhall renew their ſtrength, they ſhall mount up with wings like the Eagle, they ſhall run, and not be weary, walk and not faint.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>How many more are there that ſeem to ſtand at a ſtay?</hi> We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay they halt, that they are not uniform, or not conſtant, they are not to be accuſed of any notorious lapſes, or goings backward, but alas they are come yet but to a little pitch in religion, their knowledge of the things of God is but little, that of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 12. is applicable to them. <hi>Whereas for the time they might have been teachers of others, they had need be themſelves taught the firſt principles of Religioṅ,</hi> and muſt be ſpoken to as Babes in Chriſt, ſuch as had <hi>need of milk, and not of ſtrong meat,</hi> and truly this is much the fault of good People, they do not grow in the knowledge of Chriſt, we ſee ſomething of heat in them, in whom we want a great deal of light. Others ſeem to be increaſed in light, but to be decayed in heat, and warmth for God; ſure we are we ſee a great decay of religion amongſt Chriſtians, or at leaſt but a ſmall improvement, they have in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:61084:170"/>
ſeem'd to be ſuch as have walk'd with God a long time, we do not ſee them running yet. <hi>It is true, ſome plants grow downward in the root, when they do not grow upward into the air,</hi> ſo as their growth is not ſo ſenſible, and difcernable. So it is poſſible there may be ſome ſuch Chriſtians, who though their proficiency may not ſo much appear in their outward performances, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a growth in gifts, and parts, yet they may be grown more in <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>hatred of ſin,</hi> and <hi>reſolution for God,</hi> &amp;c. and this is a good <hi>running,</hi> in Grace; they grow beſt who grow in the root, not thoſe who improve moſt, in leaves, and more exterior branches of Chriſtian profeſſion. 2. If Chriſtians cannot ſatisfy themſelves that they <hi>run</hi> in any ſenſe, it would be enquired from whence they are hindered, whether from ſome cauſe from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in or from without. 1. A man may be hindered in his <hi>bodily run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> by ſome inward <hi>obſtructions,</hi> bodily <hi>decay,</hi> or <hi>weakneſs;</hi> this muſt be cured or purged out; Chriſtians ought to ſearch whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they have no ſecret luſt, no love to the world, no greedy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be rich, nothing of ſenſuality which weakens their Souls, and keeps them from this running after Chriſt. 2. As a man may be kept from running from ſome external cauſe. So may a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian alſo be hindered in his ſpiritual race, from ſome <hi>ill company with which he is linked, from ſome impreſſions of his grand adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the</hi> Devil. From the <hi>withdrawings of Divine Grace,</hi> thoſe mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of it I mean which are neceſſary to a Chriſtians running, though not to the upholding of the ſpiritual life. If a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> be hindred from ſuch ill company as he cannot avoid, or from <hi>ſome temptations</hi> of <hi>Sathan,</hi> or from ſuch <hi>divine deſertions,</hi> he is the object of our pity, but not to be haſtily cenſured or condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but in the mean time he ought to lie under convictions of his duty to run, though it be his miſery, that at preſent he cannot run.</p>

               <p>The greater part of the World moveth not after Chriſt at all. One Man runs after his ſenſual ſatisfactions, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her after ſenſible enjȯyments, making haſt to be rich, few after Chriſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>: What is the reaſon? The Scripture layeth the fault upon the immediate proximate cauſe, that <hi>is, Man's perverſe will,</hi> he will not come to Chriſt that he might live; but there is an higher cauſe, for no more would any other Soul have
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:61084:170"/>
done, if the Lord had not drawn it, and made it partaker of his powerful, ſpecial Grace, had it pleaſed the Lord to have done as much for thoſe other Souls, they would have come, they would have run likewiſe. But you will ſay then mens Damnation is from God, and is not cauſed ſo much from their not running, as from God's not drawing. I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpoken to this Objection, but it comes again a croſs me. I will add but a word, or two, or rather repeat what I have already ſaid in the caſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Objection were indeed conſiderable, if, 1.</hi> God did not in ſome degree draw every Soul to whom the Goſpel is preached,</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>If the Sinner did to his utmoſt obey thoſe drawings,</hi> and <hi>God yet denied his further and more effectual Grace.</hi> But as I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhewed you, there is no Soul that liveth under the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel, but is drawn, drawn by <hi>Exhortations, Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Promiſes of reward,</hi> &amp;c. the proper <hi>Cords of a Man.</hi> Nay, there are none amongſt the Heathens, but are <hi>drawn</hi> by the <hi>Cords</hi> of <hi>common gracious Providence,</hi> God (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>leaveth not them without witneſs.</hi> Now though none of theſe Cords are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to <hi>draw</hi> the Soul home to Chriſt, yet they are ſufficient with that power which is left in the will of Man, to ingage him to many acts of <hi>Reformation,</hi> and to the <hi>performance of many acts of moral diſcipline;</hi> yea, and of <hi>Religion</hi> too, (that part of it, which lyeth in Bodily exerciſe) if men will not do what they have a power to do, how ſhall their deſtruction be from God, for denying them his ſpecial grace? Eſpecially when we ſay, That although the good uſe of common Grace meriteth nothing at the hand of God, yet God doth never deny his <hi>ſpecial Grace,</hi> but <hi>where common Grace is firſt wilfully abuſed;</hi> and thus the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Sinners lyeth at their own Doors, not becauſe that if they would they might repent, believe, and turn to God, but becauſe, that if they would, they might make ſuch an uſe of the common Grace of God, as in the uſe of it, God would not be wanting to them in the giving them that further power to Spiritual acts, which they have not of themſelves. But now if we riſe higher, and enquire, how ſome come to uſe <hi>common Grace</hi> better than others, when all have an equal <hi>Natural power,</hi> to do thoſe acts of <hi>Moral diſcipline</hi> and of <hi>Religion</hi> alſo, which extend no further then to a bodily labour; how it comes to paſs, that ſome get leave of themſelves, of their Luſts and Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:61084:171"/>
to do them, others do not? We muſt ſay there is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of God's Spirit of Grace more upon the one than the other inclining them thereto; but ſo long as others have a <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural power</hi> thus far which they do not uſe, God is acquitted of their Blood, and their Damnation is of themſelves, though his abounding grace be more ſeen as to others whom he doth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther incline to a better uſe of <hi>common Grace,</hi> and their natural abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities; but of this I have ſpoken before, and do now little more than repeat.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſame account muſt be given <hi>of the uneven pace which is diſcernable in ſuch as are Chriſtians indeed.</hi> The running of God's own People is not alike, though they have all the ſame renewed Nature, and inward principle of life, <hi>To will is preſent with them all,</hi> yet they have not all an equal ſtrength to perform. Nor an equal life, <hi>livelineſs, freedom,</hi> and <hi>chearfulneſs</hi> in their walkings with God, there may be much blame to be laid upon themſelves, for not uſing the Grace of God as they ought to do, not keeping their Watch as they ought to keep it, but the <hi>Original cauſe</hi> is the want of <hi>Divine drawings,</hi> which are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with-held as a puniſhment to ſome looſe and careleſs walking ſometimes, as the <hi>product of Divine Wiſdom</hi> for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of ſome habits of Grace, which are not ſo well tryed and exerciſed under the full influences of divine grace upon them, as under the partial withdrawings of it.</p>
               <p>There might be other uſes made of this point, but they would be moſtly ſuch, as were proper to the former Doctrine, and there inlarged upon. So as I ſhall proceed no further in Application of this Diſcourſe.</p>

                  <hi>thee.</hi> She prayeth for <hi>drawing,</hi> ſhe promiſeth her <hi>running. Drawing</hi> was the act of her <hi>beloved. Running</hi> was her own Act, though in force of his drawing. But here is (as I before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved) an alteration of the Number, She ſaith, <hi>Draw me;</hi> She addeth, <hi>We will run.</hi> She begs but for one, ſhe promiſeth for more, ſhe prayeth for her ſelf, ſhe promiſeth for others. How is this?</p>
               <p n="1">1. I told you when I opened thé words, that ſome by <hi>We</hi> underſtand, <hi>The Spouſe and the Spirit of</hi> God in conjunction. I, and thy <hi>Grace.</hi> This is a Senſe hinted by <hi>Genebrard</hi> and <hi>De Ponte</hi> upon the Text, and it may ſeem to have ſome colour from that of Chriſt, <hi>Without me you can do nothing,</hi> and that of <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 2. 20. <hi>I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me, and the life which I now live in the Fleſh; I live by the Faith of the Son of God.</hi> It is a great truth, that when ever the Soul runs after <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the holy Spirit aſſiſts its motion; but yet it is drawing, that is Chriſt's and his Spirits work, <hi>running</hi> is ours. <hi>Grace</hi> works together with the Child of God, but it worketh by drawing, the Soul works by running; it is not Chriſt or the Spirit of Chriſt that is in us, that runneth the way of God's Commandments, but it is the Soul of the Chriſtian, in and with the ſtrength, and power of Chriſt. <hi>Grace</hi> is the Principle of our Spiritual life, like the Spirit within <hi>Ezechiels</hi> Wheels, without which the Wheels move not; but they are the Wheels that move. I cannot therefore agree this ſence.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Bernard</hi> hath another Notion, She begs (ſaith he) <hi>The ſowre part for her ſelf, the ſweeter part for others,</hi> but this is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation which to me ſeemeth to have many faults. 1. It maketh the <hi>drawing</hi> here prayed for, to be a <hi>drawing by Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,</hi> which are indeed the Lord's Cords, but ſuch as he ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom draweth Souls to Chriſt by, not are they the proper mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of our Prayer. Secondly, <hi>It turneth the Promiſe into a Prayer,</hi> and makes the Senſe to be to this purpoſe, Lord for me, <hi>Draw me</hi> with the Cords of Affliction: <hi>Let others run after thee;</hi> but I ſee no ground at all for ſuch an Interpretation. It is not <hi>others,</hi> but <hi>We,</hi> ſhe includeth her ſelf. It is not, <hi>let others run,</hi> but <hi>we will run.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If by the <hi>Spouſe</hi> we here underſtand the <hi>Church</hi> ſpeaking, The Church being many yet make but <hi>one Body.</hi> So the Spouſe prayeth for her <hi>whole Body</hi> which is but one, and ſaith properly, <hi>draw me,</hi> and then <hi>promiſeth for every part,</hi>
                  <pb n="334" facs="tcp:61084:172"/>
Rom. 12. 5. <hi>We being many are one Body;</hi> She prayeth for <hi>Grace,</hi> ſhe promiſeth not only action, and obedience, but unity in her obedience and action, God's Kingdom is not divided againſt its ſelf, not different from it ſelf, eſpecially in the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals of Faith, and Holineſs. They are an Army in order, and fighting together againſt <hi>the World, the Fleſh,</hi> and <hi>the Devil;</hi> but this ſtill is more than I will run.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I rather chooſe another ſence of this Promiſe. <hi>A promiſe of an endeavour to cauſe others to run</hi> after Chriſt, or a Prophecy that others would run, ſo as the ſenſe ſhould be this; <hi>Lord draw me,</hi> and <hi>I will endeavour to be a cauſe of more than my own running after thee;</hi> others ſeeing, or hearing of thy Grace and Goodneſs to me, ſhall alſo by my example be provoked to run af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thee. In this ſence I ſhall carry it. The Propoſition reſulting from hence is this,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> That God's ſweet, and powerful drawing of one Soul, to, or after himſelf, will be a means of cauſing others alſo to run after him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>God's drawing of</hi> John, <hi>1</hi> John <hi>26. draweth firſt two other Diſciples, who when they heard him, followed</hi> Jeſus: <hi>and</hi> Andrew <hi>drew</hi> Simon Peter, <hi>v. 40, Chriſt's drawing of</hi> Philip, <hi>was the occaſion of</hi> Nathaniel<hi>'s running, v. 45.</hi> Philip findeth Nathaniel, <hi>and ſaith unto him,</hi> We have found him of whom <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Law, and the Prophets did write. <hi>Chriſt draweth the</hi> Woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> John <hi>4. v. 28.</hi> She leaves her Water pot, <hi>and goes her way into the City, and ſaith to the men of the City,</hi> Come ſee a Man, which told me all things that I ever did, is not this the Chriſt? Then they went out of the City, and came unto him, <hi>and v. 41.</hi> Many more believed becauſe of his own word.</p>
               <p>There are two main grounds upon which the truth of this Propoſition depends. 1. The firſt is <hi>the alluring nature of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace.</hi> 2. The Second is, <hi>The exceeding Charity of every pious Soul.</hi> I will alittle enlarge upon them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I ſay, firſt, <hi>Divine Grace</hi> in the <hi>effects of it is exceedingly attractive.</hi> The love of God (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>conſtraineth;</hi> nor doth it only conſtrain the Soul in which it is ſhed abroad through the Holy Ghoſt, but it alſo conſtraineth others, at leaſt to ſome inquiries after it. The Fathers kindneſs to one Child maketh every Child more ſtudious to pleaſe him, and the Maſters kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:61084:172"/>
to one Servant, encourageth others to their duty. We have not perfect ſingle Hearts, to act meerly in compliance with a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pt, even <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf <hi>had an eye to the recompence of reward.</hi> Nor are we only incourag'd from the proſpect of a futur recompence, but we muſt alſo be encouraged, from ſome promiſes, or hopes of preſent aſſiſtance. <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>The Sluggard ſaith, there is a Lion in the way</hi> We are prone to fancy Lions, where indeed there are none, The way of holineſs is a plain and lightſome way, no rough nor dark way, God hath ſaid, <hi>Wayſaring men though fools, ſhall not err therein;</hi> but we know not how to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, and indeed there are <hi>Lions</hi> and <hi>Mountains</hi> in the way. The roaring Lion is in the way, who goeth about continually ſeeking whom may he devour, &amp; we have Mountains of Luſts and Corruptions, as well as of <hi>Worldly Temptations</hi> that are in our<note place="margin">Mat. 11. 30.</note> way. Chriſt hath told us, that <hi>his Yoke is eaſie, his burden is light.</hi> We cannot underſtand it; Is it an eaſie thing to <hi>deny our ſelves, to take up the Croſs,</hi> and to <hi>follow Chriſt?</hi> To keep a ſteady even pace with God? The very Thoughts of the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a Chriſtians life, make many to turn away from it, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Yoke of Chriſt, as a Yoke which no Fleſh and Blood is able to bear. But now the effects of Divine Grace upon one Soul here incourageth many others. We are like Travellers, going toward the City of God, we meet with Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers over which we muſt paſs, the River ſeems deep, and the Stream ſeems to run ſwift, here our Hearts fail; but as it is with earthly Travellers in ſuch a caſe, if one ventures through, and gets ſafe on ſhore, then many follow: So when we ſee ſome that were under our diſcouragments from entring upon the ways of God, yet through Grace got into them, and finding them eaſie, and pleaſant, this is a great encouragement to others. I have known ſome who have long ſtumbled at this Stone: Better never to know the way of Righteouſneſs, never to enter into a courſe of Profeſſion, than having entred into it to fall Back; that I ſhall do, I ſhall never be able to hold on in a courſe of Duty; I ſhall never conquer ſuch Corruptions, &amp;c. Now when God draweth but one Soul, others are incouraged to run, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40. v. 1, 2, 3. <hi>I waited</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) patiently for the Lord; he inclined to me, and heard my cry. He brought me up alſo out of an horrible Pit, out of the miry Clay, and ſet my ſeet up-a Rock, and eſtabliſhed my goings, and he hath put a new Song into my Mouth, even praiſe unto our God. Many ſhall ſee it, and fear,</hi>
                  <pb n="336" facs="tcp:61084:173"/>
                  <hi>and truſt in the Lord.</hi> One bleſſed <hi>Martyr,</hi> is upheld by God, and Burns chearfully, his aſhes ſet many others on fire. From hence it is that the converſation of Chriſtians is a <hi>Winning con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,</hi> and Chriſtians are perſuaded to walk, that others may be won by them. There is nothing unlovely in the effects of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Grace. Serenity and peace of Conſcience, contentation in all Eſtates, Juſtice, and Charity towards men, they are all the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Grace, and exceeding lovely in the Eyes of all reaſonable Creatures.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſecond ground of this lyes in that <hi>Charity, or good will toward men, which is the ſteady effect of this grace;</hi> whoſoever is taught of God to love God, is alſo taught to love men; all men with a love of good will, though the Saints only with a love of <hi>complacency or delight.</hi> Two things in purſuit of this will be found the effects of true Saving grace, in every Soul that hath been made partaker of it.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1. Firſt,</hi> Such a Soul will reveal the grace that it hath received. <hi>2.</hi> It will excite, and quicken others to look after their ſhare in the ſame grace.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, <hi>A gracious Soul is alwayes communicative.</hi> Grace, in the Soul, is like new Wine in the Bottle, which muſt have vent, ſee <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 66. 16. <hi>Come, and hear all you that fear God, and I will declare what he hath done for my Soul. I cried unto him with my Mouth, and he was extolled by my Tongue.</hi> Chriſt when he healed the lame Man in the Goſpel bid him, that he ſhould tell no Man of it, yet he muſt go and publiſh it. He ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver when he heals a Soul, ſaith to it, <hi>Tell no Man of it,</hi> nay, he ſaith the quite contrary. <hi>When thou art converted</hi> (ſaith he to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Strengthen thy Brethren, Luk.</hi> 22. 32. Such a Soul cannot hold its peace. <hi>Job</hi> could not eat his bodily morſels alone, but much leſs can the Soul eat <hi>his Spiritual Morſels,</hi> and let none know of it. If the Woman in the parable could not find her loſt Groat, but ſhe muſt call in her Neighbours and ſpend it upon them, how ſhall a Man that diſcerns his loſt Soul to be found, his loſt <hi>Peace,</hi> and <hi>ſtrength,</hi> and <hi>livelineſs</hi> to be recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not call his Neighbours, and tell them what God hath done for him? <hi>Sorrow</hi> and joy both fill the Heart, both pain it, the communication of either unto others in ſome degree eaſeth it. There are in the World Myſteries of other knowledge, which Men have and do very ſtudiouſly conceal, <hi>becauſe</hi> the more are
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:61084:173"/>
made partakers of them, the worſe it is for thoſe who got the firſt knowledge, they get the leſs; but it is otherwiſe as to <hi>Grace</hi> that is an inexhauſtible Fountain, all may have their fill of the Fountain of Living Waters, and the Soul that makes firſt diſcovery of it to another loſeth nothing by the diſcovery. If <hi>Abraham</hi> knoweth any thing of the mind of God, he will <hi>teach his Family;</hi> therefore, God will not <hi>hide from</hi> Abraham, <hi>what he intends to do to</hi> Sodom. Several reaſons might be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, why <hi>grace</hi> will not lye hid in the Soul: Such a Soul ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends it ſelf under ſome Obligation of duty, that of Chriſt to <hi>Peter, when thou art converted, ſtrengthen thy Brethren,</hi> muſt not be underſtood as a ſpecial and particular precept. 2. The <hi>Joy</hi> of <hi>that Soul,</hi> that hath any evidence that it hath taſted of of this grace, is ſuch as cannot be concealed; little Streams may be circumſcribed by the Banks of the River; but great falls and flows of Water, will overflow them. We cannot bite in great paſſions. Nor can a greater joy fill the Soul, than that which ariſeth from the ſenſe of God's ſpecial love, either in the firſt Collation of it upon, or the returns of it unto the Soul.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Again this Soul knoweth, <hi>That much of God's praiſe ariſeth from his Peoples telling of his wondrous works;</hi> you ſhall in Scripture obſerve it as a conſtant piece of God's Peoples thanksgiving, and what we are often called to for. Now the good report which a pious Soul makes of Chriſt, hath a great influence upon others. If a Phyſicians Name be up, if but two or three Neighbours make a report, what wonderful Cures he hath done in, and for them, all in like Circumſtances will be running to him. See what <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. 2. <hi>My Soul ſhall make her boaſt in the Lord, the humble ſhall hear thereof and be glad.</hi> v. 6. <hi>This poor Man cryed, and the Lord heard him, and ſaved him out of all his Troubles.</hi> When a gracious Soul makes its boaſt in the Lord, relates with joy and thankfulneſs, what God hath done for it: The <hi>humble,</hi> that is, thoſe that are in poor, afflicted conditions, they hear of it, and are glad, and are encouraged to go to God. They ſay, Here's a poor Soul that cried, and the Lord heard it, and ſaved it out of all its troubles. This is the firſt way, by which Souls once drawn are a means to make others run, by making a good report of God unto them. But this is not all.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, Such a Souls Charity extendeth further, <hi>viz. To an exciting, exhorting, and quickening of others, to labour to be</hi>
                  <pb n="338" facs="tcp:61084:174"/>
                  <hi>made partakers of the ſame grace. Come</hi> (ſaith the Woman of <hi>Samaria) and ſee the Man that hath told me all things that I ever did, Is not this the Chriſt?</hi> Come ſaith the Soul, and taſte of that love which hath ſo refreſhed me; my Soul was as <hi>ſad as yours.</hi> God hath comforted me; as dead as yours, The Lord hath quickned me. I had once as much prejudice againſt the ways of God as you; I once thought them as difficult: I now delight in them. I find now the <hi>Yoke of Chriſt is caſis, his burden is light. Come, let us go up together to the Mountain of the Lora's Houſe, he will teach us his ways, and we will walk in his paths.</hi> I will ſhew you in two or three words, from whence it is that a Soul that hath taſted the ſpecial grace of God, will be ſo buſie with others to bring them into the ſame circumſtances with it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It knoweth <hi>that it ſhall loſe nothing by others running.</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture makes us all in the firſt place to ſecure our own Intereſt, but that being firſt ſecured, good nature obligeth all Men to wiſh the beſt they can to others, and the <hi>Moraliſts</hi> give it us for a Rule, <hi>That thoſe kindneſſes ought to be denied to none which we can do them without any prejudice to our ſelves.</hi> There is no Soul that hath received any thing of the <hi>ſpecial grace of God,</hi> but knoweth ſomthing of the value of it, and that no ſo great kindneſs can be done for another, as to be an Inſtrument to bring men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men acquainted with that grace of God which bringeth Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 29. <hi>I would to God</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Agrippa) that not only thou, but alſo all that hear me this day, were both almoſt, and altogether ſuch as I am, except theſe Bonds.</hi> This Soul knoweth, that it ſhould be never the poorer, if all others were inriched with the riches of Grace. All <hi>Envy</hi> which maketh us pine at the good of others is taken out of the heart of a Child of God, (it is one of thoſe luſts that are mortified in it.)</p>
               <p n="2">2. Nay further, <hi>It knows that the more Souls it can be a means to bring to Heaven, the more welcome it ſelf ſhall be.</hi> Thoſe who win <hi>Souls are wiſe,</hi> and <hi>thoſe who win many to Righteouſneſs, ſhall ſhine as the Stars, for ever and ever,</hi> Dan. 12. 3. It was Chriſts work to <hi>bring many Sons unto Glory.</hi> It was <hi>David</hi>'s Language, and he ſpoke in the Perſon of Chriſt, <hi>I will declare thy Name unto my Brethren, in the midſt of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation I will praiſe thee.</hi> The Propagation of its Species, is one of the moſt perfect acts of the Creature. It is a great piece of the perfection of a Chriſtian, to propagate his Species. The
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:61084:174"/>
                  <hi>Romans</hi> deſigned rewards for the Father of ſuch a number of Children; God hath prepared great rewards for thoſe that are co-workers with him in bringing Souls unto Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Laſtly, Such a Soul knows the <hi>Price of a Soul, and the ſad condition of thoſe who want Chriſt either in the firſt, or further influences of his ſpecial grace,</hi> and ſo doth it out of mere pity and commiſeration. None knows the miſery of a Chriſtleſs Soul, ſo well as that Soul, that hath been loſt, and is now found, hath been dead, and is now alive. None ſo well knows the miſery of that poor Creature whoſe Conſcience is upon a Rack, or whoſe Soul is under a Divine deſertion, crying out, <hi>Where is my God become?</hi> We never well underſtand the miſery of others, nor throughly pity them under any miſery till our ſelves have felt it. Nor on the other ſide do we ever underſtand the riches of Grace, the conſolations of the Spirit, or the Soul ſatisfaction which a Chriſtian hath in God and in his ways, till we have in ſome meaſures had experience of them. Hence it is that a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural man is ſo unconcerned, in the natural ſtate of his Relations, it is becauſe his own Eyes are not open; he wants <hi>Faith,</hi> he doth not ſee the miſery of a Soul that is without Chriſt, nor doth he believe what God hath in his Word revealed as to the ſtate of ſuch Souls. But the Spiritual Man whoſe Eyes God hath opened, (knowing God's terrors) perſuades with others to get out of the horrible Pit; the believing Soul, giving a firm and ſteady aſſent to what God hath revealed in his Word about the Eternal State of Souls, and the only way to happineſs, cannot but Night and Day perſuade with others thoſe eſpecially in whom it is moſt nearly concerned, that they would be reconciled to God, and flee from that Wrath which is to come.</p>

Chriſt tells his Diſciples, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 13. <hi>That they were the Salt of the Earth:</hi> and v. 14. <hi>The light of the World, a City ſet upon an Hill;</hi> that God had not lighted <hi>up a light in their Souls to be hid, for no Man lighteth a Candle to put to it under a Buſhel</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>but to be ſet on a Candleſtick, that it might give light to all them that are in the Houſe.</hi> Upon this he foundeth an Exhortation, <hi>v.</hi> 16. <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine before men, that they may ſee your good works, and glorifie your Father which is in Heaven.</hi> I ſee no reaſon to reſtrain thoſe Texts unto thoſe that are the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Goſpel; they are true of all true Chriſtians, the Children of God in the World, are the <hi>Salt of the World,</hi> and it is their duty to ſeaſon others. They are the <hi>light of the World,</hi> and to ſhew light to the World; they are obliged ſo to live that being themſelves drawn, others alſo by their means may run after Chriſt. You will ſay to me how ſhall this be? How ſhould a Chriſtian ſo live as to draw others to run after Chriſt. I anſwer It will very much depend upon, 1. The <hi>Seriouſneſs of his pious behaviour towards God.</hi> 2. The <hi>Humility and Inn cency,</hi> and <hi>quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his behaviour toward men.</hi> 3. <hi>His abounding in good works.</hi> 4. His <hi>Communicativeneſs</hi> both of his <hi>Gifts,</hi> and of his <hi>Experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi> I will a little inlarge upon all theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I ſav Firſt, It will much depend upon the <hi>Evenneſs, and Seriouſneſs of a Chriſtians pious behaviour toward God.</hi> Religion is in it ſelf a lovely thing, and many who cannot get leave of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:61084:175"/>
to be pious, and devout, yet are conſtrained to commend it in others, where they ſee the Practitioners in it <hi>ſerious,</hi> and <hi>even</hi> in their practice, for nothing is more odious even to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Eyes, than to ſee men act a part in Religion; but for a Chriſtian in praying to pray, in hearing to hear, to be ſerious and in earneſt in his acts of devotion, ſo to demean himſelf, that he ſhall appear to others to mind what he is about, to be fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent in Spirit while he is ſerving the Lord, is lovely in all mens account; to ſee men gaping about the Church whiles they are pretending to pray, ſleeping, or talking when they are pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to hear the Word of God, winneth none, but rather eſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the World from God and makes them think there is nothing in Religion but a vain ſhew: But to ſee a Chriſtian ſerious, and ſervent in prayer, diligent and attentive in hearing, hanging as it were upon the Preachers Lips, as it is ſaid of thoſe who heard Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 48. (we tranſlate it <hi>they were very attentive</hi> to hear him, the <hi>Greek</hi> is they did hang upon <hi>him)</hi> this makes People think there is ſomething in Godlineſs: Eſpecially when men are <hi>even</hi> in their pious converſation, that their warmth in Piety, is not by fits, but there are the ſame at all times, having to do with the ſame God, and being in the ſame ſervice of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſecond thing upon which the inciting others to come to, and to run after Chriſt, doth much depend, is <hi>Chriſtians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>havior towards men;</hi> ſo three things much commend the grace of God to the World.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Humility.</hi> Pride, and ſelf exalting, are generally odious to all men, and men (as it were by a natural inſtinct) conclude there is nothing of God in thoſe in whom they ſee much of <hi>Pride,</hi> diſcovered by an <hi>immoderate boaſting, uncharitable judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and <hi>cenſuring, ſuperciliouſneſs,</hi> a <hi>ſcorn,</hi> and <hi>contempt</hi> of others; but now where men have the advantage of the Word of God, which commands men to deny themſelves to be <hi>cloathed with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,</hi> in honour to prefer others before themſelves, to learn of Chriſt for he is <hi>meek,</hi> and <hi>lowly,</hi> &amp;c. they are much more confirmed in this; and any thing of pride in Chriſtians doth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eſtrange men from God and Chriſt, then cauſe them to run after him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Innocency</hi> in Chriſtians is another thing, which much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends the ways of God to others. Chriſt commanded his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:61084:176"/>
to be <hi>wiſe as Serpents, innocent as Doves. Paul</hi> exhorteth the <hi>Philippians,</hi> 2. <hi>Phil.</hi> 15. to be <hi>blameleſs and harmleſs, the Sons of God without rebuke.</hi> Moſt People have a natural Notion of God that he is full of <hi>goodneſs,</hi> and doth no Man <hi>harm;</hi> and thoſe who are in any meaſure acquainted with the Scriptures, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that Chriſt's converſation on Earth was an innocent, harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs converſation, the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 26. calleth him, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>undefiled,</hi> and <hi>ſeparate from Sinners,</hi> but <hi>holy,</hi> and <hi>harmleſs.</hi> Now an <hi>innocent</hi> converſation implieth righteouſneſs, in all <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice</hi> there muſt be harm done to others.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third thing that makes an <hi>honeſt and winning Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on towards men is quietneſs and peaceableneſs</hi> in oppoſition to <hi>Tumultuouſneſs, Sedition,</hi> and <hi>qua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>iet,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4. 11. I need not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large upon this, Experience tells you how much a quietneſs, and peaceableneſs of behaviour obligeth the World, and how much a contrary temper diſobligeth it from Men and Women profeſſing to Religion and Godlineſs. God is the <hi>God of Peace,</hi> and delighteth not in confuſion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third thing upon which much depends, the winning and gaining of others to run after Chriſt is <hi>abounding in good works.</hi> I here reſtrain the Notion of good works, underſtanding by them acts of <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> towards men. Our Saviour bids us <hi>make our ſelves Friends of the Mammon of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> and by it teacheth us, that <hi>good works</hi> of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are not unprofitable as to our own Souls, though they are no fit price to purchaſe Heaven with. But they are alſo of great uſe to <hi>ſave the Souls of others,</hi> as they have a tendency to commend the grace, and ways of God unto other men. On the other ſide, acts of <hi>Oppreſſion, Cruelty, and uncharitableneſs,</hi> have a great malignity, to eſtrange Souls from Religion and Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. It is a ſad ſtory I have ſomewhere met with upon the Cruelty ſhewed by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to the <hi>Indians</hi> upon their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended converting them to the Faith of the Goſpel; A great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the <hi>Indians</hi> would know whither the Souls of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> went when they died, to <hi>Heaven</hi> or to <hi>Hell;</hi> and being told they went to Heaven, replied<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Then he woula go to Hell.</hi> Being it ſeems naturally perſuaded that cruel, bloody, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable men could never be happy in another life.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I will add a fourth thing (though not beforementioned) which
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:61084:176"/>
experience hath conſtantly ſhewed us to be of very great force, to draw others, <hi>viz. A bold, and couragious Suffering for the Name of Chriſt.</hi> It hath been a conſtant Obſervation, that <hi>the Blood of Martyrs hath been the ſeed of the Church.</hi> Men naturally are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to think there is a great deal in that Religion, which will make men ſo Valiant as to die in the defence and aſſerting of it. There is yet one thing more upon which this much depends; that is,</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>A Chriſtians communicativeneſs both of his gifts, and of his experiences.</hi> 1. Of his <hi>gifts,</hi> his <hi>knowledge</hi> and other gifts, by which he informs Chriſtians of the Truth, and perſuades, and argues them out of their ſinful courſes. <hi>Come</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) I will teach you the ſear of the Lord;</hi> O that there were more of this in the World than there is! how few are thoſe Chriſtians that have either grace or confidence enough to mind others of their conditions and to call upon them to look after Eternity! We can call upon our Children and Friends to mind their World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerns, we are communicative euough to them of what we know, which may help them as to them; but how little do we call upon them to <hi>ſtrive to enter in at the ſtrait Gate, to make their Calling and Election ſure.</hi> What ſhould the reaſon of this be? Is it unbelief, or is it careleſneſs? Is it <hi>unbelief?</hi> do we not then believe an <hi>Immortal, Eternal ſtate of Souls,</hi> into which no Souls can come, but bv and through Chriſt as the way? It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, this is the Object of our Hope, it is the great thing we have in expectation; if we had hope only in this Life, we were of all men moſt miſerable. Are we confident that our Children, our Friends, or Neighbours are in the road to this bleſſed ſtate? Certainly there are many of them of whom we can have no ſuch hopes. How are we then ſilent? if we know bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things then they know, why do we not inſtruct them? St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>He that hath of this Worlds goods, and ſeeth his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in want and releives him not, how dwells the love of God in h m?</hi> 1 Jo. 3. 17. What ſhall we ſay of thoſe who have of the goods that relate to another World, the Treaſures of Spiritual knowledge and ſeeth his Child, his Friend in want, and (to his power) relieves him not, how dwells the love of God, or of his Childs, or Friends Soul in him? <hi>Dalilah</hi> asked <hi>Sampſon,</hi> how he could ſay to her, that he loved her, when he kept his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets from her, which ſhe was not concerned to know; but how
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:61084:177"/>
canſt thou ſay, thou loveſt thy Yoke-fellow thy Child, thy Friend, and concealeſt from them what thou knoweſt with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to their Spiritual and Eternal good, and which it is as much their concern to know as it is thine? I remember Chriſt doth thus prove himſelf his Diſciples friend, <hi>John</hi> 15. 15. <hi>I have called you Friends, for all things which I have heard of my Father, I have made known to you;</hi> that is, all things which my Father hath let me know, and which are of concern for you to know. Thus Chriſt hath diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Office of a Friend to our Souls, and ſhould not we do likewiſe? Do we know any thing concerns our near Friends Souls with reference to their Eternals happineſs, and do we conceal our knowledge from them, how do we diſcharge the Office of Friends to them? how dwells either the love of God, or the love of them in our Souls?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Nor is the communicativeneſs of our own <hi>Experiences,</hi> What we have ſeen, as well as what we have heard, <hi>of leſs uſe,</hi> or <hi>leſs our duty.</hi> I know it is a thing which profane Perſons may mock at, but let them mock on, <hi>Wiſdom ſhall be juſtified of her Children.</hi> I am ſure we meet with <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and others of the Servants of God of whom we have a ſacred Record very frequent in it. <hi>Come</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>I will tell you what God hath done for my Soul.</hi> I know Men may boaſt beyond their line, or meaſure, they may boaſt of experiences they never had; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences muſt be fulfillings of Promiſes. But certainly there can be nothing as a mean more powerful to draw others to a running after Chriſt in the ways of Holineſs then the knowledge of what others have found, and experienced in them. I am ſure it was the practice of the <hi>Woman</hi> of <hi>Samaria,</hi> of <hi>Andrew</hi> and <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and that with great ſucceſs. O let every one of us who have in our hearts any love for God, <hi>any zeal</hi> for the glory of God, any kindneſs for the Souls of others, being our ſelves drawn, ſo behave our ſelves, that others, allured by our examples, perſuaded by our arguments may alſo run after Chriſt. Let thoſe that cannot as yet diſcern the <hi>Savour of his good Oyntments</hi> be helped to diſcern them at ſecond hand, while <hi>our Lips feed many, and our Garments ſmell of Myrrh, Aloes and Caſſia.</hi>

                  <hi>the King.</hi> The word is the ſame, that is every where uſed, to expreſs the <hi>ſole dominion</hi> of a Perſon over others; a term very properly given to Chriſt, and that not only as he is <hi>God over all bleſſed for ever,</hi> and ſo the Pſalmiſt telleth us, that <hi>his Throne is eſtabliſhed in the Heavens, and his Kingdom ruleth over all;</hi> but in reſpect of his <hi>Mediatory Kingdom,</hi> as he is the Lords <hi>King, whom he hath ſet upon his holy Hill of</hi> Sion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 6. to whom he hath given the Heathen <hi>for his inheritance, and the uttermoſt part of the Earth for his poſſeſſion,</hi> v. 8. which Kingdom he doth not only exerciſe over all, in order to the gathering of his Church, ſubduing the hearts of people unto himſelf, and then over his

But why doth the Spouſe here ſpeak to her beloved or of hėr beloved, in this lofty ſtile, and not rather in that familiar ſtile which ſhe generally uſeth in this Song? What if we ſhould ſay?</p>
               <p n="1">1. That in other places of this Divine Song, ſhe <hi>is ſpeaking to him,</hi> here ſhe is <hi>ſpeaking of him.</hi> God is the <hi>King of Kings,</hi> the <hi>Lord of Lords;</hi> yet when we pray unto him, we are licenſed and commanded to ſay unto him, <hi>Our Father;</hi> when ſhe ſpeaks of him to others, ſhe uſeth another ſtile, and ſaith, <hi>the King;</hi> though we are allowed an <hi>holy boldneſs</hi> in our acceſſes, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to the Throne of Grace, yet this is not excluſive of that <hi>holy fear and reverence</hi> which we owe unto God as our <hi>King,</hi> we ought to remember, that he who is our <hi>Beloved</hi> [our <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther]</hi> is alſo our <hi>King.</hi>

She was praying, her lips moved, but her voice was not heard, yet the Lord heard her, and though the time muſt be fulfilled before ſhe could have a Son, yet 1 <hi>Sam,</hi> 1. 18. It is ſaid of her at preſent, <hi>that ſhe went away, and did eat, and her countenance was no more ſad.</hi> She had a preſent anſwer of peace, her mind was quieted, her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance was no more ſad, you have another inſtance in <hi>Daniel</hi> (to name no more,) <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 20. <hi>Daniel</hi> with the reſt of the Jews had been in the captivity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> near 70 years, the time was almoſt expired, as to which God had promiſed they ſhould come out, <hi>Daniel</hi> ſets himſelf to pray, and you have a copy of his prayer from <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. <hi>v.</hi> 4. <hi>to v.</hi> 20.

Here now the Lord made a very quick return to <hi>Daniels</hi> prayer, while he was ſpeaking, the Lord anſwered him,</p>
               <p>But a return of prayers may be <hi>quick,</hi> though it be not thus quick, but after the interval of ſome few months, days, or years; <hi>Abraham</hi> was thus anſwered as to his Prayer mentioned, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. and <hi>David</hi> glorieth in the aſſurance of this, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. 3. <hi>The Lord will hear when I call upon him.</hi> But now, becauſe on the one hand this is a very deſirable mercy, and many times the Souls of
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:61084:179"/>
Gods people are diſcouraged, and flagg in duty, becauſe the viſion is yet for an appointed time; It will not be out of our way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to inquire, <hi>what prayers theſe are that meet with ſo quick an audience from God,</hi> God doth not this at all times, nor for all perſons, no, not for thoſe who are moſt beloved of him. <hi>David</hi> himſelf complaineth; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. 2. <hi>O my God, I cry in the day time, but thou heareſt not, and in the night ſeaſon, and am not ſilent.</hi> The Church complains of ſome times, <hi>when God is angry with the prayers of his people, Pſal.</hi> 80. 4 Gods own People ſometimes ſhoot arrow after arrow, to find what they ſhot firſt; hence you ſo often meet with it as a piece of the Saints Prayer, <hi>Hear my prayer O God, give ear to my Supplications.</hi> Let us a little en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire from whence this variety of Providence proceeds, as to this hearing, and anſwering of prayers. God is the Lord that changeth not, therefore we are not conſumed, we muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore find the cauſe in the perſons praying, or in the prayers which maketh this difference as to Gods anſwers. That ſo quick and gracious anſwers may be obtained, ſomething is neceſſary on the <hi>party praying:</hi> Something <hi>with reſpect to the matter prayed for:</hi> Something <hi>as to the manner of putting up the prayer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. As to the <hi>Perſon praying,</hi> 1. No Soul can expect ſuch an anſwer, unleſs perſons in <hi>ſpecial favour</hi> with God; this the Angel told <hi>Daniel,</hi> Dan. 9. 23. <hi>At the beginning of thy ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the commandment came forth, and I am come to ſhew thee, &amp;c. for thou art greatly beloved.</hi> Ordinary ſubjects may have their petitions anſwered, but they muſt be favourites, that have the Kings ear preſently; thoſe Souls to whom God gives preſent anſwers of prayers are ordinarily ſuch as are <hi>beloved, greatly beloved.</hi> A good natured Mother may help a Child that is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſons, being in any ill circumſtances, and crying to her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud, and fiercely, but it is a ſign the Child is her own, when her bowels yern towards it as ſoon as it begins to cry, yet I find two inſtances at leaſt in Scripture of Gods preſent anſwering the cries of perſons in no ſuch ſtate of favour with God, <hi>Ahab</hi> and the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Nineveh,</hi> 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 21. 27, 28, 29. &amp; <hi>Jonas</hi> 3. 4. But beſides, that thoſe inſtances relate meerly to <hi>temporal mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> and ſuch wherein not thoſe Perſons alone, but great bodies of people were concerned, and in ſuch caſes, as nothing but a preſent anſwer could have done them good, as to the thing wherein they were heard, <hi>Nineveh</hi> was within <hi>forty days</hi> of
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:61084:179"/>
ruine, and it was only a deferring of that judgment which God had threatned, as to which they were heard, I ſay beſides theſe things, it is one thing what God may do out of the abundance of his goodneſs, and mercy, and <hi>another thing, what they may with any confidence expect.</hi> It is moſt certain that perſons who are ſtrangers, and enemies to God, and ſo under a threatning, <hi>That although they make many prayers, God will not hear them;</hi> and of whom God hath ſaid, <hi>that their ſacrifices are abomination,</hi> cannot hope that the Lord ſhould anſwer, much leſs preſently anſwer their prayers. 2. As to a <hi>preſent anſwer of prayers, it is neceſſary not only that the perſons praying be believers,</hi> perſons in favour with God, <hi>but that their prayers be prayers of faith,</hi> that they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe faith in their prayers, <hi>James</hi> 1. 5. <hi>If any of you want wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; let him ask of God.</hi>—But v. 6. <hi>Let him ask in faith, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wavering, for he that wavereth, is like a wave of the Sea, dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of the wind, and toſſed,</hi> and James 5. 15. <hi>The prayer of faith ſhall ſave the ſick;</hi> Prayers for Perſons <hi>ſick,</hi> ordinarily require preſent anſwers, now ſaith the Apoſtle, the prayer which ſaveth the ſick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> muſt be the <hi>prayer of faith.</hi> This is a point not well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, <hi>viz.</hi> how to <hi>pray in faith,</hi> and what exerciſe of faith is required in prayer, I ſhall therefore ſhortly open it, and ſhew you what exerciſes of faith are neceſſary to that Soul, that would have his prayers at all anſwered, at leaſt who can expect a preſent anſwer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Faith in prayer muſt reſpect Gods being and goodneſs.</hi> This the Apoſtle informeth us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6. <hi>He who cometh unto God, muſt believe that God is, and that he is a rewarder of them that ſeek him.</hi> That God is, and that he is <hi>able</hi> to give what we ask of him; <hi>Believe you</hi> (ſaith Chriſt to the blind man) <hi>that I am able to do this?</hi> If God be, if he be God, he is able to do whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver we ask of him. But this is not all, we muſt alſo <hi>believe the goodneſs of God; That he is a rewarder of them that ſeek him:</hi> one who hath ſaid to the Children of Men, <hi>ſeek ye my face, and who never ſaid to the ſeed of</hi> Jacob, <hi>ſeek ye my face in vain.</hi> This is the firſt act of faith in prayer, whoſoever cometh to ſeek God for any mercy, muſt ſteadily agree to this, That God is, and is able to grant the thing he asks of him, and that he is infinitely good, and a rewarder of thoſe Souls, that obey his will in that precept, <hi>ſeek ye my face.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Faith muſt reſpect that promiſe which God hath made for that</hi>
                  <pb n="350" facs="tcp:61084:180"/>
                  <hi>mercy, or good thing which we come to God for.</hi> There is hardly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny particular good thing, for which God hath not ſomewhere in his word made a particular promiſe; now this promiſe is Gods bond which faith laies hold on, and prayer puts in ſuit, if we want a particular promiſe, reſpecting the ſpecifical mercy, yet there are general promiſes, within the latitude of which thoſe particular good things fall, ſuch as thoſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84. 11. <hi>He will give grace and glory, and no good thing will he with-hold from them that walk uprightly,</hi> Pſal. 34. 10. <hi>They that ſeek the Lord, ſhall not want any good thing,</hi> Rom. 8. 24. <hi>We know that all things work together for them that love God,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 22. 23. <hi>All things are yours, and you are Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods.</hi> Now I ſay that he that prayeth in faith, muſt have his Eye either upon ſome of theſe more general words, in which God hath promiſed all good things, or thoſe particular promiſes, wherein God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed that ſpecifical mercy, which he comes to ask of God, <hi>Mar.</hi> 11. 24, <hi>What things ſoever you deſire when you pray, believe that you ſhall receive them, and you ſhall have them.</hi> It is not only neceſſary that when we go unto God in prayer, we ſhould Eye him, as the <hi>fountain of power,</hi> ſo able to grant what we ask of him, and as the <hi>fountain of goodneſs,</hi> ſo willing to relieve all the ſtreights, and ſupply all the neceſſities of poor creatures; but 3. <hi>As a God of truth and faithfulneſs,</hi> that he believe that he ſhall receive what he asketh of God, and to this end he muſt ſee the good thing either generally, or particularly promiſed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is yet a third act of faith neceſſary, which is <hi>a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of our Souls upon God in the promiſe, a truſting in him for the receit of the thing we have asked of him. James</hi> ſaith, <hi>we muſt ask in faith nothing wavering,</hi> the Soul muſt not doubt within itſelf, whether God hears, or will give in a gracious anſwer, yea or no, but commit itſelf wholly to God, upon the credit of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, believing that he who hath promiſed, is able to perform, and truſting in him for a performance. This is now praying in faith, and the truth is, all other praying is but praying in forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, of which we can expect no more profit then ariſeth from a meer bodily labour. This, now is neceſſary with reference to an anſwer, eſpecially a quick and a preſent anſwer, on the part of the perſon praying.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But ſomething alſo is neceſſary to be obſerved, <hi>with reſpect to the matter that we pray for.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="351" facs="tcp:61084:180"/>
1. It muſt be <hi>ſomething which is truly and really good for us and of which we ſtand in need.</hi> Our need of a thing, and the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it for us, is not to be meaſured from our ſenſe, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, for we are often miſtaken, and do not keep what is good for our ſelves, and therefore muſt refer our ſelves to the <hi>wiſdom of God,</hi> who knoweth what things we have need of. It is true that there are ſome things ſo perfectly, and abſolutely good, as they can never be evil, ſuch are the <hi>pardon of our ſins,</hi> the <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>favour of God,</hi> &amp;c. But there are other things that are not ſo, which at ſome time we may have a need of, and they would be good to us, at another time we have no need of, but they would be hurtful, and pernicious to us, and this is the reaſon why our ſupplications for ſome things may be abſolute, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory, for other things they ought to be limited, conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and put up with a reference of our ſelves to the will, and wiſdom of God; God cannot give <hi>evil things</hi> unto his Children, though they ask them never ſo importunately, never ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently. This our Saviour hath taught us, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 11. 12. <hi>If a Son ſhall ask Bread of any of you that is a Father, will he give him a ſtone, or if he ask a fiſh, will he for a fiſh give him a Serpent. Or if he ſhall ask an Egg, will he offer him a Scorpion? if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you being evil, know how to give good gifts to your Children, how much more ſhall your heavenly Father give his holy Spirit to them that ask him, Mat.</hi> 7. 11. it is, <hi>give good things to them that ask him.</hi> It is moſt certain, that no one would ask things that are, or would be hurtful to him, wittingly. Children through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance may, but if they do, their parents that have more wiſdom, will not give them ſuch things. No more will our Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who knows it is nothing but ignorance that cauſeth us to ask any thing of that nature. And this may help us to underſtand Gods diſpenſations, and ſatisfy the people of God, though they have not all thoſe things they ask of God, if they be ſuch things as are not abſolutely, and perfectly good, they may be ſuch things as the Lord knoweth under our circumſtances, would be evil and pernicious to us, and we are anſwered by being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied them, for though through our weakneſs and ignorance we asked them, as believing them to be good, yet had we known them as indeed they were, we would have prayed againſt them. The things we ask, muſt be good, and ſuch things as we ſtand in need of (indeed therein lies the nature of goodneſs) or they
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:61084:181"/>
are no matter of a promiſe, and conſequently ought to be made no matter of prayer, nor would be but for our infirmity and weakneſs, and conſequently they may be denied us, and we may never have an anſwer, by receiving the things which we ask, but are anſwered, in having them denied to us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>What we ask muſt be according to the will of God,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 14. <hi>And this is the confidence that we have in him, that if we ask any<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thing according to the will of God, he heareth us.</hi> The Spirit <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth interceſſion for us, according to the will of God.</hi> Indeed this doth very little differ from the other, for whatſoever is <hi>good for us,</hi> is doubtleſs <hi>according to the will of God.</hi> It is Gods will that no good thing ſhould be with-held from them who live upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But there is yet ſomething further that I ſhall add under this head, which is neceſſary in order to the receiving of a preſent anſwer from God; If we would have a preſent anſwer, we muſt ask for ſuch things, not only as it is the <hi>will of God we ſhould have,</hi> but as it is according to the will of God we ſhould have at <hi>ſuch a time as we ask,</hi> and <hi>under ſuch circumſtances as we then are Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> telleth us, <hi>there is a time for all things.</hi> God hath appointed <hi>times</hi> and <hi>ſeaſons</hi> for all his diſpenſations of providence, he had not only promiſed <hi>Canaan</hi> to the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but he had ſet the time, after <hi>four hundred and thirty years;</hi> he had not only promiſed a deliverance, out of the <hi>Captivity</hi> of <hi>Babylon,</hi> but he had alſo ſet the time <hi>ſeventy years.</hi> Hence, <hi>Daniel</hi> was preſently heard, when he prayed, the Text telleth you; that he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by Books the number of the years, whereof the word of the Lord <hi>came to Jeremiah the Prophet, that he would accompliſh 70 years in the deſolations of</hi> Hieruſalem. <hi>Then he ſet his face to the Lord God, to ſeek by prayer and ſupplications, with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

To <hi>Habakkuk</hi> it fell out otherwiſe, he put up a prayer to to God, ch. 1. his anſwer was, ch. 3. v. 3. <hi>The Viſion is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it ſhall ſpeak, it ſhall not lie, tho it tarry, wait for it, becauſe it will ſurely come, it will not tarry.</hi> Had the believing Jews prayed never ſo often, never ſo ſeriouſly, for the coming of the ſeed of <hi>Abrahams</hi> out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and going into <hi>Canaan</hi> before the four hundred years were expired, they could have neither expected, nor received any preſent anſwer, other than according to the tenor of that to <hi>Habakkuk;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 16, 17. Though God had promiſed <hi>Abraham,</hi>

                  <hi>that he would give unto his Seed the land of Canaan,</hi> yet he had alſo told him, <hi>that they ſhould be ſtrangers in a land that was not theirs, and they ſhould ſerve them, and they ſhould afflict them,</hi> 400 <hi>years—but afterwards they ſhould come out with great ſubſtance,</hi> and v. 16. <hi>In the fourth generation his Seed ſhould come again into</hi> Canaan. All things are ſeen by an Omniſcient Eye, and ordered by an <hi>eternal thought.</hi> Now where the believing prayer meets with an eternal thought, as to the time of the mercy, there the anſwer is alwaies preſent. See therefore how confidently the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> prayeth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 202. 12. <hi>Thou ſhalt ariſe, and have mercy upon</hi> Sion, <hi>for the time to favour her, yea, the ſet time is come;</hi> when the time, the ſet time for God to favour a <hi>Nation,</hi> or a particular Soul is come, then the anſwer is alwaies preſent. It is therefore the great wiſdom of a Chriſtian, before he ſets him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to pray, to inquire ſo far as he may, whether Gods ſet time for the collation of the mercy is come.</p>

               <p n="1">1. The firſt is <hi>a bringing them to the acknowledgment of their tranſgreſſions, and an humbling of them in the apprehenſion ef them.</hi> God by puniſhing us, whether in our fleſh, or with more inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal troubles in our minds, brings our iniquities to our remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, &amp; ſaies to us in every affliction, <hi>Know therefore, &amp; ſee that it is an evil and bitter thing that thou haſt done, in that thou haſt depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the living God, &amp; that his fear hath not been within thee;</hi> and this is one thing which he aimeth at, to bring his people to be vile, &amp; low in their own Eyes, when this is done, Gods end is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily fulfilled. Hence you ſhall obſerve, that before Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of a gracious return to his People, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. 14, 15. there is put in v. 13. <hi>Only acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou haſt tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed againſt the Lord thy God;</hi> ſo that if our affliction hath brought us to this acknowledgment of our iniquities, and a lying low before God, it may give us encouragement to hope that Gods time, his ſet time is come, for though he hath not particularly told us the day, and hour, when he will return unto his people, either in a way of ſpecial providence, or in a way of
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:61084:183"/>
ſpecial grace, yet he having annexed the promiſe of his graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous returns to his peoples acknowledgment of their offences, and humbling themſelves, he hath effectually told them, that when that is done, is the time when they may expect to ſeek his face, with a ſpeedy ſucceſs, and gracious iſſues.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſecond end which God aimeth at in the afflictions of his people, whether by with holding ſome deſired mercies from them, or making them to feel ſome ſenſible ſmart, is the <hi>exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of his Peoples Grace.</hi> This is plainly expreſſed in the before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned text, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5. 15. <hi>I will return</hi> (ſaith God) unto my place, till they ackuowledge their offences, and <hi>ſeek my face.</hi> There are two <hi>gracious exerciſes</hi> which the Lord by affliction <hi>extiteth.</hi> 1. The firſt is the <hi>grace of prayer.</hi> This is moſt proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſignified, by the term <hi>ſeek my ſace,</hi> (though I know it is a phraſe more comprehenſive) yet that is moſt ordinarily expreſſed by it; this is not only expreſſed in that text, but in many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. <hi>Is any man afflicted</hi> (ſaith <hi>James) let him pray,</hi> ſo Pſal. 50. 12. <hi>Call upon me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou ſhalt praiſe me.</hi> Hence it is an excellent ſign that Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time to ſhew mercy, either to a people, or to a Soul is come, when the Lord poureth out upon them <hi>the Spirit of grace, and ſupplication,</hi> he more ſpecially moveth, and inciteth his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to ask, when it is in his heart to give the mercy that they ask of him, and on the other ſide, the reſtraining of prayer from God on our part, or the with-holding the Spirit of Prayer (on Gods part) is an ill ſign that our mercy is yet afar off. 2. A ſecond <hi>exerciſe</hi> of grace, the exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of which God aims at, <hi>is that of faith. Zech.</hi> 13. 9. <hi>They ſhall ſay the Lord is my God;</hi> this is now when a Soul for the mercy which it deſireth, is brought off all dependances upon the creature, and brought to a ſole Eying of, and dependency upon God; and this is true, both as to more publick and national mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and alſo as to more private, and perſonal mercies. <hi>Iſrael</hi> were a great way off mercy, when they truſted on the <hi>broken reeds</hi> of <hi>Ae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ypt</hi> and <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> inſtead of helping them, they ran into their hands, and more wounded them, but they were very near mercy when they ſaid, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14. 3. <hi>Aſhur ſhall not ſave us, neither will we ride upon Horſes, neither will we ſay any more to the work of our hands, ye are our Gods, for in thee the Fatherleſs finds mercy.</hi> Mark what God addeth in the very next words; <hi>I will heal their backſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,</hi>
                  <pb n="357" facs="tcp:61084:183"/>
                  <hi>I will love them freely, for mine anger is turned away, I will be as the dew unto</hi> Iſrael, <hi>he ſhall grow as the lilly, and caſt forth his roots, as</hi> Lebanon. Hence again it appeareth, that when Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, for the mercies they want and would ask of God, are brought off all forreign dependencies, all creature confidence, and brought to a ſingle, ſole confidence in God, this is an excellent ſign, that the day is dawning upon them, and the time come, which God hath ſet in his eternal thoughts, wherein he intendeth to ſhew them favour.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third end which God aimeth at, in, and by our afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is, <hi>the probation and trial of grace, I will melt them, and try them,</hi> Jer. 9. 7. <hi>I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them, as Silver is refined, and will try them as Gold is tryed. Faith</hi> and <hi>Patience</hi> are thoſe two graces which are more eminently tryed in an hour of affliction; you have them both mentioned together, <hi>James</hi> 1. 2, 3. <hi>My Brethren count it all joy, when you fall into divers temptations, knowing this, that the trial of your faith worketh patience,</hi> and again; <hi>let patience have its perfect work,</hi> &amp; 1 Pet. 1. 6. <hi>You are in heavineſs through mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſold temptations, that the trial of your ſaith, being much more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, then that of Gold that periſheth, though it be tried with fire, might be ſound unto praiſe, honour, and glory,</hi> &amp;c. by faith here is meant a relieance, and dependance upon God, notwithſtanding our trials, <hi>Job</hi> expreſſeth it well, <hi>Job</hi> 13. 15. <hi>Though he ſlay me, yet will I truſt in him.</hi> Hence again, if a Soul findeth that its afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (be it of what nature it will) hath humbled it to Gods foot, made it quiet, and patient, reſolving meekly, and without repi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or murmuring to bear the indignation of God, becauſe he hath laid it upon it, and that it hath brought him to a reliance and dependance upon God, though it doth not ſee him, this (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain) is an excellent ſign, that Gods <hi>ſet time</hi> is come.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſecond rule to know Gods <hi>ſet time</hi> by, is this, <hi>When a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or a particular ſoul is wrought into ſuch a frame, as the promiſe of mercy is made unto. David</hi> ſaith of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 20. 17. <hi>Thou haſt heard the deſire of the humble, thou wilt prepare their heart, thou will cauſe thine ear to hear.</hi> Mark, firſt God prepareth the heart, then he cauſeth his ear to hear; firſt, he prepareth the hearts of people to receive the mercy, then he gives out the mercy; now how doth God prepare the heart, but by working of it up into ſuch a frame, as he hath promiſed the mercy upon, and unto?</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="358" facs="tcp:61084:184"/>
1. He worketh the heart into a <hi>patient, meek, humble, ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive frame,</hi> he heareth the deſire of the humble, as you have it in that text, but of this I have ſpoken but now.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>In the mountain of the Lord it ſhall be ſeen.</hi> We are then prepared for mercy, when we know not how longer to uphold, and ſubſiſt without it, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 57. 16. <hi>I will not</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for ever, neither will I be alwaies wroth, for the Spirits would fail before me, and the Souls which I have made,</hi> v. 18. <hi>I have ſeen his ways, and will heal him, and will lead him alſo, and reſtore comforts unto him.</hi> When <hi>Peter</hi> cried out that he <hi>ſank,</hi> then Chriſt lent hhim is hand; when the Soul apprehends itſelf as it were at the laſt gaſp, that is often Gods time, for he will not ſuffer his peoples Spirits to fail, nor the Souls which he hath made.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In ſuch diſpenſations of mercy to the People of God, as muſt depend upon the deſtroying or removing of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; <hi>the exceeding wickedneſs of the enemy, is a good ſign that Gods ſet time is near, for the Salvation of his people from them.</hi> I build this concluſion upon Gods Word to <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 15. 16. where God gives this as the reaſon why the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould not till after four hundred years, take a poſſeſſion of the land of <hi>Canaan—for the iniquity of the</hi> Amorites <hi>is not yet full.</hi> The wicked have their day, and their day is with reference to the people of God, the very <hi>power of darkneſs,</hi> but as it is with the darkneſs of the night, they ſay it is darkeſt juſt before the dawning of the day, ſo the darkneſs cauſed to the Church of God, by the wickedneſs of the wicked, when it is at the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, is a good preſage of approaching light. So as though the day of the gteateſt malice, oppreſſion, and wickedneſs of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, be a very ſad day, even the power of darkneſs, yetin this it ſpeaketh well, that the ſalvation of Gods people is nevernearer.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Laſtly, <hi>In regard the ſet times of our mercies are hidden from the beſt of Gods people, in caſe they have not a preſent anſwer in kind, they muſt be content if they have it in value.</hi> I pray obſerve this. God anſwereth the prayers of his people more ways then one, ſometimes he anſwereth them by <hi>denying</hi> them, nor is this a way of anſwering to be deſpiſed, for whatſoever the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar thing be, which a reaſonable Soul deſires, its general deſire is <hi>ſome good.</hi> Our reaſonable natures will not ſuffer us to ask any thing which is bad, if we ſo apprehend it, now ſuch is the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of our ſtate, that we in all circumſtances do not know what
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:61084:184"/>
is good for our ſelves. So that God often in denying a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar deſire of our Souls, anſwereth the general deſire of our Souls, we ask what would do us hurt; God denieth it, becauſe he would do us good, and not hurt. In this caſe if the Lord gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth us an heart content to be without the thing we ask, he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly anſwereth our prayers, and giveth us the general and true deſire of our Souls. God ſometimes anſwereth our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, by giving us <hi>idem,</hi> the ſame thing which we ask, but this he never doth, but where he ſeeth it is for our good, and that under our preſent circumſtances; ſometimes he anſwereth us by giving us <hi>tantundem,</hi> the value of the mercy, though not the particular thing which we ask of God, thus he anſwered <hi>Paul</hi> as to <hi>the thorn in his fleſh,</hi> and this is a real anſwer, and with this every Child of God ought to be fully ſatisfied, and contented.</p>
               <p>But this is enough to have ſaid to this point, how Chriſtians may know whether <hi>Gods time,</hi> his ſet time to favour his Church, or the Souls of his people is come, a point of great concern in order to the ſatisfaction of Chriſtians, why they have not a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent anſwer to their prayers, &amp; to abate their diſſatisfaction, as to the inequal motions of <hi>Divine Providence</hi> in this anſwer of prayers.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Laſtly, Something is neceſſary with reference to the <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of our prayers,</hi> if we would ſo pray as to receive a preſent anſwer. So two things are neceſſary; 1. That we pray <hi>Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly.</hi> 2. <hi>Fervently.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Believingly.</hi> I opened this before, under the firſt head, and therefore ſhall ſay nothing to it here.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Fervently.</hi> That is that which alone I ſhall here ſpeak to. This is much miſtaken, if it be thought to lie in the vehemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of our tone, and expreſſion, it lyeth much deeper in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion of the mind, and the Souls ſecret affection to, and in the duty. <hi>James</hi> tells us, ch. 5. v. 16. <hi>The effectual ſervent prayer of the righteous availeth much.</hi> The word is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſignifieth <hi>operative</hi> and <hi>working,</hi> and ſo working, as it produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the effect. The Prophet ſpeaking of God, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 41. 4. uſeth this expreſſion, <hi>who hath wrought, and done it,</hi> the <hi>Septuagint</hi> tranſlate the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word there by this word, the Apoſtle uſeth it to expreſs ſuch a working, as that by which <hi>God bringeth about his decrees,</hi> Eph. 1. 11. <hi>Who worketh all things according to the counſel of his will;</hi> and again, he uſeth it to expreſs the <hi>working of the Devil</hi> in wicked men, whom he calleth <hi>Children of diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi>
                  <pb n="360" facs="tcp:61084:185"/>

                  </gap> becauſe of the great power, and force, which the evil Spirit put forth upon, and ſhewed in thoſe miſerable creatures that were poſſeſſed. <hi>Piſcator</hi> upon the Text, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 16. tranſlates it <hi>Ardens,</hi> the burning flaming pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. <hi>Beza</hi> tranſlateth it <hi>Efficax,</hi> the efficacious prayer; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> doubtleſs ſignifies <hi>that prayer, which ſetteth the whole Soul on work.</hi> There is a cold, dead, lazy prayer, where the <hi>tongue</hi> only is ſet on work, or only the <hi>tongue,</hi> and the <hi>head,</hi> or the <hi>fancy;</hi> the one to invent and compoſe matter, the other to utter it, but neither of theſe is that <hi>fervent prayer</hi> which St. <hi>James</hi> ſpeaketh of, but that prayer which ſetteth the whole Soul in motion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, where not only the fancy and imagination, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding are imployed to invent and ſuggeſt matter, the <hi>will</hi> to will it, but the <hi>affections</hi> (which indeed in a reaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are but the motions of the will towards its object) with the utmoſt intenſion to <hi>deſire it,</hi> to exerciſe an hope in God for it, &amp;c. this is the <hi>fervent working prayer</hi> mentioned by St. <hi>James,</hi> this prayer doth much with God. <hi>Jacobs prayer</hi> was ſuch a pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith he <hi>wreſtled with God until the morning,</hi> he ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God. <hi>I will not let thee go, until thou bleſſeſt me,</hi> the Prophet expounds it, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 12. 4. <hi>He wept, and made ſupplications unto him;</hi> by this prayer he <hi>had power over the Angel, and prevailed</hi> (as it is there in the words immediately preceding) yea, and he had a preſent anſwer, God bleſſed him before he parted with him as you read in his Hiſtory. Such a prayer was <hi>Daniels,</hi> to which he received alſo a preſent anſwer, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. <hi>v.</hi> 3. I (ſaith he) ſet <hi>my face to the Lord God,</hi> to ſeek by <hi>Prayer and Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: with faſting, and ſackcloth, and aſhes,</hi> ſuch was <hi>Elijahs</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. 42. The text ſaith. <hi>He put his face betwixt his knees,</hi> a poſture ſignifying the great intenſion of his mind and ſpirit. It is a praying with <hi>ſtrong cries and groans which cannot be uttered,</hi> which is the Apoſtles phraſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26. This pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing comes up to the firſt, and great commandment. <hi>Yhou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy Soul, and all thy ſtrength.</hi> This is like the drawing the arrow to the head, which ſendeth it with more force to the mark; nor indeed is there a better ſign of a ſudden anſwer, than when the Lord hath thus prepared the heart. A man ſeldom finds his Soul more then ordinarily fervent, and importunate with God for a mercy, but when the Lord hath
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:61084:185"/>
determined ſuddenly to give it in to him. Thus now I have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you in what caſes God ordinarily gives in ſpeedy anſwers to his peoples prayer. But God doth not do this alwaies. <hi>David</hi> himſelf complaineth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. 2. <hi>O my God, I cry in the day time, but thou heareſt not, and in the night ſeaſon, and am not ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.</hi> The Church crieth out, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80. 4. <hi>O Lord God of Hoſts, how long wilt thou be angry with the prayers of thy people?</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>he ſhutteth out my prayer, Lam.</hi> 3. 8. What ſhould be the reaſon of theſe inequal diſpenſations from the hand of the ſame God, and gracious Father? I anſwer;</p>
               <p n="1">1, Why may not God do it, <hi>that we may not track him in his ways?</hi> He will be known to be a free agent. He will ſometimes give preſent anſwer, that his people may be confirmed in their faith, that God is a God hearing prayer. The God, <hi>that never ſaid to the ſeed of</hi> Jacob, <hi>ſeek my face in vain;</hi> he will not alwaies give a preſent anſwer, that we may not aſcribe too much unto prayer, nor will he alwaies delay, that we may not aſcribe too little to it. If God ſhould alwaies give a preſent anſwer, we ſhould aſcribe too much to prayer, and make an idol of a duty. That the Lord might ſecure his own glory, and be owned as the God of our mercies, the object of our faith, and dependence, the free fountain of all our good things, God is pleaſed, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſooner, ſometimes later, to give in anſwer to his peoples prayer.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But there may be reaſon enough for it, fetched <hi>from the prayers themſelves.</hi> One prayer may be made more in faith than another, more fervent than another, more fitted to Gods ſet time, for the beſtowing of a mercy than another; it is true no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of theſe can render the prayer more meritorious, our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, take them at the beſt, are too poor things to be the price of the leaſt mercies, when we have done all that we can, we are unprofitable ſervants; but where one prayer is more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the will of God than another, it may move God further, and may obtain a more ſpeedy anſwer from Gods hand.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Finally there may be ſome reaſon given <hi>on the account of the parties praying.</hi> Some of Gods <hi>people may be greater favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites with God then others;</hi> God loves all his Saints with an equal <hi>elective,</hi> and <hi>redeeming</hi> love, but there may be differences as to the manifeſtations of his love. <hi>Samuel,</hi> and <hi>Moſes, Noah, Daniel,</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> are mentioned by the Prophets, as Perſons that had a
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:61084:186"/>
mighty power with God above others. God therefore in the expreſſion of his anger againſt <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſaith, if they ſtood before him, they ſhould only ſave their own Souls. God ſent <hi>Abime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Jobs</hi> Friends to <hi>Job,</hi> to pray for them, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them that thoſe he would accept, God had a <hi>David</hi> whom he calls the man according to Gods own heart, and Chriſt had a <hi>John,</hi> who was called the <hi>beloved Diſciple,</hi> all the Diſciples were beloved, but he was loved with a more ſpecial, ſignal love, this the Diſciples knew, and therefore when he had told them, that one of them ſhould betray him, <hi>Simon Peter</hi> beckned to <hi>John,</hi> that he <hi>ſhould ask him of whom he ſpake.</hi> Now it is no wonder if the prayer of him who is <hi>highly beloved</hi> in ſome ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular degree of favour with God, ſhould receive a quicker an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer then anothers, this is but after the manner of men. 2. <hi>The ſtate of Gods people, may be ſuch as will admit of no delay.</hi> If the Lord doth not come in with ſome preſent help, they muſt be loſt and undone, their Spirits muſt fail, and the Souls which he hath made; now in ſuch caſes as theſe, it is no wonder if the Lord gratifies his people with quicker anſwers, and returns to their prayers; but who is he that can pretend to give a reaſon of Gods differing diſpenſations of his grace? all that we can do in this caſe, is but to ſhew you that the ways of the Lord are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, though the reaſon of them be a depth paſt our finding out. We ſhould not ſufficiently adore, and admire God, if we did perfectly underſtand him; but I ſhall add no more doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally to this diſcourſe, much of which, though it may look like ſomething of a digreſſion, yet I hope it will not be altogether unprofitable.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Uſe 1.</note> This notion <hi>wonderfully commendeth the love of God to the Sons, and Daughters of Men.</hi> There is not any one <hi>name of God,</hi> that more commendeth the love of God to us, or which we have more reaſon to glory in than, that <hi>he is a God that heareth pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</hi> It is true God needeth not our tongues, to tell him what we have need of, he knoweth what things we need before we ask him, nor do our prayers merit any favour, It is the goodneſs, the free goodneſs of God that relieveth us in any ſtreight, in any diſtreſs, but you know it is very natural to us, when we are in any miſery, in any diſtreſs, or ſtreight, to <hi>cry for help,</hi> and a wonderful relief to our thoughts, to know that our ſighs, and cries, and groans are not loſt in the air; Oh! 'tis a ſad, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:61084:186"/>
thing to <hi>cry,</hi> and to have none to help, none to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver. What a comfortable thing it is to <hi>cry in hope,</hi> nay, <hi>in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, for we have this confidence</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>that if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us.</hi> Now that the great and mighty God, who needeth not our ſupplications, ſhould lend an ear to them, and give us an aſſurance of his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and anſwering them, what a mighty thing is this to ſet up God high in our thoughts, for the Majeſty of Heaven to ſtoop to the worms of the Earth, when they but turn up their heads to him? What a condeſcenſion is this? what an humbling of the Divine Majeſty? what a relief to poor creatures infirmities, to know, that not a ſigh, not a groan, not a prayer ſhall be loſt? But this is yet ſomething beyond this; That the Lord ſhould oft-times give a preſent anſwer, and prevent our impatience by an anſwer ſo ſwift, as gives our Eyes no leave to fail through a fruſtrated expectation; this is yet a great deal more. In recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving our petitions, and promiſing us an anſwer, God ſhews him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a gracious <hi>King,</hi> though we wait ſome time for an anſwer, but in his preſent anſwers he ſhews himſelf a <hi>gracious Father,</hi> that is not patient that his Child ſhould be one hour in diſtreſs and miſery. Nor is the love of our Heavenly Father alone com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in this particular, but the love of Jeſus Chriſt alſo is remarkably commended, for it is through him that <hi>we have boldneſs to enter into the holieſt, by the blood of Jeſus, by a new and living way which he hath conſecrated for us through the vail, that is to ſay, his fleſh, and he is the High Prieſt over the Houſe of God.</hi> O let every quick return of prayers which God makes to our Souls, bring us more in love with Chriſt, more into the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his love, and raiſe up our hearts more in <hi>thankfulneſs,</hi> for the death, reſurrection and interceſſion of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Uſe 2.</note> Secondly, <hi>How ſhould this incourage us to prayer, and to ſuch a performance of that duty, as we may have a quick return, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</hi> Prayer is not ſo ſlighty a duty, as the moſt of people do make it, it ought not to be made ſuch a formal performance. It is one of our great priviledges to have an acceſs, a freedom of acceſs to the Throne of Grace, to ask of God ſuch things as we ſtand in need of; it is that which bringeth down the Protection, and influences of common providence, and the influences of his ſpecial grace, it openeth, and ſhutteth up Heaven. By prayer <hi>Elijah</hi> brought down <hi>rain</hi> and <hi>fire</hi> from Heaven; <hi>Samuels Prayer</hi>
                  <pb n="364" facs="tcp:61084:187"/>
brought thunder, and lightning. <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> prayer brought down an <hi>Angel,</hi> that deſtroyed the Hoſt of <hi>Sennacherib,</hi> it obtained a bleſſing for <hi>Jacob,</hi> and turned his name into the name of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> becauſe as a Prince he had power, and prevailed with God; nay, it often brings down the mercy we want in a very ſhort time, while the Child of God is ſpeaking, God anſwereth, here am I. This ſhould make us value the duty of <hi>prayer,</hi> and not to think it a mere thing of courſe, and turn it into a formality. And what you have heard concerning the nature of that prayer, which is of ſuch power and prevalency with God, ſhould alſo mind you to take heed <hi>how you pray.</hi> Prayer doth not lie in a meer uttering, or repeating of words expreſſive of our minds unto God, men may call this <hi>prayer,</hi> but they will find it a bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly labour of a little efficacy, and avail with God; it is true, you will hardly find any thing called <hi>Prayer</hi> in Scripture, where <hi>words</hi> were not uſed, it ſeemeth to be ſomething more then the ſecret deſire of the Soul; the deſires of our Souls, expreſſed by the words of our lips, is what is generally called <hi>prayer,</hi> in holy writs, but words without inward affections, words not thruſt out from the force of our internal deſires and affections, are the leaſt thing in prayer, which lieth not in the pouring forth of words, but in the pourings out of our Souls before God. Labour Chriſtians to underſtand the nature of <hi>prayer,</hi> both as to the matter you ſhould pray for, and as to the right manner of the performance of it, you all know what you would have, what you have need of, what is truly good for you under your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent circumſtances, this you know not; ſome things are abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good, univerſally neceſſary, ſuch things as all Souls at all times have need of, ſuch are <hi>pardon of ſins, ſanctification, further grace to honour and glorify God in your circumſtances,</hi> and relations, an heart to honour and glorify God in whatſoever ſtate and condition you are; theſe and ſuch like things you may beg <hi>importunately,</hi> and <hi>abſolutely,</hi> and that at all times. But there are other things which are not ſo abſolutely and univerſally good, but are good or evil, as they are well uſed, or abuſed. Theſe muſt be asked of God, with a ſubmiſſion to his will, and a reference to his wiſdom. It is of mighty concern for a Chriſtian rightly to underſtand the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of prayer, what he may, or may not ask of God, what he may ask abſolutely, what but conditionally, and with limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; an ignorance of this may make Chriſtians too bold, too im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:61084:187"/>
with God in asking ſome things, and to ſin by impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and murmuring, becauſe they do not receive preſently what they ask, when as the reaſon is, becauſe they ask amiſs. <hi>James</hi> tells thoſe to whom he wrote, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 3. <hi>You ask, and receive not, becauſe you ask amiſs;</hi> he inſtanceth but in one way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they asked amiſs, <hi>that you might conſume it upon your luſts.</hi> That indeed is one way by which men may miſcarry in prayer, not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting their prayer to the honour and glory of God, but meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to a <hi>ſelf-ſatisfaction,</hi> and indeed taking the words in that ſenſe, as <hi>ſpending upon their luſts</hi> ſignifies a gratifying our ſelves, and giving our ſelves a pleaſure and ſatisfaction; ſo all <hi>asking amiſs,</hi> will fall under it, and ſuch asking amiſs is the cauſe of all our not receiving; no man can ask any thing for the honour and glory of God, who doth not ask according to the will of God, God is glorified by the fulfilling of his will, and whoſoever prays, and the ſum of his prayer is not, <hi>let the Lord be glorified, let the will of the Lord be done,</hi> doth but ask that he may conſume upon his luſt, and give himſelf a ſatisfaction; now all this is <hi>asking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs,</hi> which is the cauſe of our <hi>not receiving.</hi> It is therefore I ſay of a very great concernment for a Chriſtian to know <hi>what he may pray for,</hi> what he may pray for abſolutely, and peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily, what but limitedly, and conditionally, with ſubmiſſion to the Divine will, and with a reference to the Divine wiſdom, how elſe is it poſſible, that he <hi>ſhould pray in faith?</hi> or how elſe will he be able to command his Spirit into a due ſilence, and patience, if he doth not preſently receive what he asketh of God? Nay, the ſervency of a Soul in prayer doth much depend upon this knowledge; no prayer can be fervent, but the prayer of faith. No prayer receiveth a preſent anſwer, but the prayer of faith. Study therefore (Chriſtian?) the <hi>due matter,</hi> and <hi>manner of prayer.</hi> There may be many prayers put up, and yet God not hear, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 15. <hi>Though</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>you ſpread forth your hands, I will hide my Eyes from you, yea, when you make many prayers, I will not hear,</hi> the reaſon there aſſigned is, <hi>becauſe their hands were full of blood,</hi> which amounts to that of <hi>David, If I regard iniquity in my heart, God will not hear my Prayer,</hi> and to that of <hi>Solomon, The Sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination unto the Lord, but the prayer of the upright is his delight.</hi> He that lifteth up hands unto <hi>God,</hi> muſt lift up <hi>pure hands.</hi> But a man may lift up <hi>pure hands,</hi> yet not be heard, <hi>David</hi> complaineth that he did
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:61084:188"/>
ſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. therefore the Apoſtle adds, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 8. <hi>Holy hands without wrath or doubting,</hi> for ſaith <hi>James,</hi> ch. 1. v. 7. <hi>Let not him that wavereth, think that he ſhall receive any thing of the Lord.</hi> Now it is impoſſible that a man ſhould pray <hi>without doubting,</hi> for any thing of which he is not fully perſuaded that it is the <hi>will of God that he ſhould receive it,</hi> this therefore is of very great concern, that a Soul ſhould know that he asks according to the <hi>will of God,</hi> and that muſt be when he knows that God hath ſomewhere in Scripture promiſed it. Be not therefore only much in prayer, but ſee that you do not ask amiſs, that you ask ſo, that you may receive, yea, that while you are ſpeaking, God may give you a gracious anſwer.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Uſe 3.</note> Thirdly. <hi>This Doctrine calls to you for an holy, and cloſe walking with God.</hi> A looſe liver may receive ſome good things from God, as he is a <hi>God of compaſſion,</hi> full of <hi>pity,</hi> and <hi>tender com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion,</hi> that hears even the <hi>young Ravens</hi> when they cry unto him for their food, thus did <hi>Ahab,</hi> thus did the King of <hi>Nineveth,</hi> and this was a ground for <hi>Simon Magus</hi> to pray, though he was in the gall of bitterneſs, and the bonds of iniquity; but he can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive nothing from God, as he is a <hi>God of truth and faithfulneſs,</hi> there is not in all the Book of God, one promiſe made to a wicked mans prayer. God hath ſaid, <hi>though they make many pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, he will not hear them,</hi> Iſaiah 1. 15. he hath ſaid, <hi>They ſhall call upon me, but I will not anſwer, they ſhall ſeek me early, but they ſhall not find me, Prov.</hi> 1. 28. For Hypocrites he hath ſaid, <hi>Job</hi> 27. 9. <hi>Will God hear his cry, when trouble comes upon him?</hi> but a <hi>cloſe walking with God</hi> is not only commendable to us upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that our prayers may not be wholly ſhut out from God, that we may not only in our diſtreſſes go to God as a fountain of mercy, and goodneſs, as a God of pity, and tender compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but as unto a God of truth and faithfulneſs, with an hope, and a confidence in him, and an expectation upon him, and with an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly boldneſs: but alſo that we may <hi>have a preſent anſwer,</hi> we are naturally haſty as to the <hi>ſupply of our wants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and the ſatisfaction of our deſires, hence we ſay, <hi>Bis dat qui cito dat,</hi> and count that kindneſs double, which is done for us quickly. Now they are the favourites of Heaven, that gain the quickeſt anſwers from God. There's nothing makes one Soul more the favourite of God then another, but a more ardent love for God, and a more ſtrict, and cloſe walking with God. Let this ingage us to <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect holiveſs in the fear of the Lord.</hi> Study therefore the cloſeſt
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:61084:188"/>
degrees of fellowſhip, and communion with God, the ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt courſe of an holy converſation. There is a great deal of difference even in good mens communion with God, ſome are more upon the mountwith God then others are, more in holy meditation and contemplation, more in ſecret duties, more in prayer, more in watchfulneſs, more warm, and zealous for God, <hi>David</hi> had many <hi>worthies,</hi> but he had a <hi>firſt three,</hi> to which the others did not come up, though they did worthily. God hath many Souls, that he loveth, that are dear and precious in his Eyes, but he hath alſo his <hi>firſt threes,</hi> ſome that excel, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run others; theſe are they that have moſt of Gods Ear, for tho the firſt grace be not given, becauſe men keep his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, yet <hi>further grace,</hi> the manifeſtations, and ſignal tokens of Divine love are given out (according to the promiſe, <hi>Jo.</hi> 14. 21.) as men love, and keep the Commandments of God; you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that would excel in the favour of God, that would have Gods ear fully and preſently open to your ſupplications, ſtudy to excel in holineſs. Doth a poor Courtier in the Courts of Earthly Princes, bleſs himſelf in having the Ear of his Prince, that if he hath a Petition to put up unto his Prince, he can go immediately into his preſence, and have his Petition preſently ſigned, whereas the Petitions of others are rejected, or at leaſt deferred, ſo as he is conſtrained to wait months or years? And is this no priviledge, no happineſs at all, that a poor Soul can immediately go unto the Lord of Heaven and Earth, to him who is the Fountain of all grace and goodneſs, and if he wants any thing, freely preſent his Petition to him, and have it ſigned preſently, not let the Lord go, until he hath bleſſed him, when as a wicked man, tho he maketh many prayers, yet is not heard; yea, thoſe that may have ſome intereſt in God, yet wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king more looſely, and more imperfectly, may cry a long time, and yet not be anſwered, if we had nothing more then this to commend to us holineſs in all manner of converſation, and the ſtricteſt degrees of walking with God, yet this certainly ſhould be enough.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Uſe 4.</note> I ſhall add but one word more in application of this diſcourſe. I put into the Propoſition, the term [ſometimes] God doth not alwaies, but ſometimes give in a quick anſwer to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples prayers; <hi>Let not the people of God therefore think it ſtrange if they have not preſently an anſwer to their prayers.</hi> God is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies alike quick in his returns to the prayers of his people.
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:61084:189"/>
He always heareth them, he will be certain to anſwer them, but he is not alwaies equally quick in the anſwer of them. This is many times the trouble of Souls that belong to God; it was <hi>Davids</hi> trouble, expreſſed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. 2, 3. It was <hi>Aſaphs</hi> trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, though God did at laſt hear him, as you read, <hi>v.</hi> 1. yet he had firſt ſpake, as in <hi>v.</hi> 7. 8, 9. <hi>Will the Lord caſt off for ever, and will he be favourable no more? Is his mercy clean gone for ever? Doth his promiſe fail for evermore?</hi> Hath God forgotten to be gracious; <hi>hath he in anger ſhut up his tender mercies,</hi> yet becauſe the not hearing of prayers is threatned as a judgment, and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment upon wicked men, and mentioned in holy writ, as the reward of mens <hi>regarding iniquity in their hearts.</hi> This often cauſeth a great deal of trouble in the Spirits of Gods People. Let me therefore ſhut up this diſcourſe in adviſing alittle, what that man or woman ſhould do, that lieth at leaſt under ſome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, that God doth not <hi>hear,</hi> or hath not heard their prayers, <hi>they cry in the day time,</hi> and are not <hi>ſilent in the night ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> yet God <hi>heareth not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. In the firſt place. Let ſuch a Chriſtian examine <hi>whether it be not his own miſtake.</hi> Thou thinkeſt God hath not heard, nor anſwered thy prayers, art thou not in a miſtake? All anſwers of prayers are not diſcernable to our ſenſe. It may be God hath anſwered thee by <hi>denying thee</hi> the particular thing that thou askedſt of him; thus he anſwered <hi>Paul,</hi> by denying him as to the thing he asked, which was the taking the thorn out of his fleſh. He better knoweth what we have need of, then we our ſelves know it, the general deſire of thy Soul was <hi>for ſome good,</hi> thou didſt therefore deſire health, riches, &amp;c. becauſe thou didſt apprehend them ſuitable, and convenient, and ſo good for thee. God who knoweth thy Soul, the frame and temper of it, he ſeeth, that theſe things would be for thy hurt, he therefore with-holdeth them, and ſo in not anſwering anſwereth thee, in not anſwering thy particular requeſt, he doth anſwer the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral deſire of thy Soul, and only correcteth thy ignorance in thy requeſt. 2. You have heard that God ſometimes anſwereth by giving (though not the thing) yet the value of the thing which thou askeſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> that which is every way as ſutable and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, and as profitable for thee, as that which thou didſt deſire. Hath not God (according to thy prayer) removed thy affliction? yet, hath he ſupported thee under it? hath he filled thee with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:61084:189"/>
conſolations? hath he told thee (as he did <hi>Paul)</hi> that his <hi>grace ſhould be ſufficient for thee?</hi> Doſt thou call this no anſwer? God anſwers the prayer of that Soul, to whom he giveth the full value of the thing it asketh, though he doth not give the thing itſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If thou canſt not find that God hath anſwered thee, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in kind, nor in value, <hi>Review thy prayer, and ſee if thou canſt not find ſome failure in that, for which God with-holds his anſwer.</hi> I ſuppoſe thee a perſon reconciled to God through the blood of Chriſt; other Souls either pray not at all, or if at all, they make a meer formality of the duty, and put up prayers, as Children ſhoot arrows, never regarding whither they flie, or what beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of them, but even in a good mans prayer there may be ſuch failures as may give God a juſt cauſe to with-hold an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, without any breach of Gods truth, or faithfulneſs, thou mayeſt not have prayed in faith, but too much doubting, thou mayeſt have prayed for ſomething, which thy wiſe Father ſaw was not good for thee, or at leaſt not good for thee under ſome preſent circumſtances, under which thou art; if thou findeſt any thing of this nature, thy work is to correct thy prayers, if thou wouldſt receive an anſwer.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If thou doſt not find this, if thou canſt not charge thy want of an anſwer upon ſome defect or failure in thy prayers, nor yet find that God hath anſwered thee, either giving thee the thing which thou didſt ask of him, or the value of it in a quiet and contented frame of Spirit in the want of it, or in the ſupportations, or conſolations of his Spirit, but thy Soul is yet <hi>unquiet</hi> and <hi>impatient; it is thy duty yet to wait upon God,</hi> to chide down thy tumultuous, and unquiet thoughts, all the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings up, and murmurings of thy Soul againſt God, to adore, and to admire God where thou canſt not ſee, or underſtand him, to acknowledge Gods goodneſs and holineſs, though thou canſt not diſcern his goodneſs as to thee in this particular. Thus did <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Pſal.</hi> 22. 3. after he had complained, <hi>that he had cried in the day time, and the Lord did not hear, and in the night ſeaſon,</hi> and was not ſilent. <hi>v.</hi> 3. he ſaith, <hi>But thou art holy, O thou that inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biteſt the praiſes of</hi> Iſrael. This is moſt certainly our duty under ſuch providences as theſe are; we muſt not look in this life to underſtand all Gods ways, and methods of providence, much leſs the reaſons of them, that is a piece of knowledge reſerved
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:61084:190"/>
for another world; all that we have to do, is to obſerve, and ſtudy them, and where we cannot find them out, to admire and adore them, and to <hi>wait upon him,</hi> that wrappeth up himſelf <hi>in thick darkneſs, and hideth his face from the Houſe of</hi> Jacob. This <hi>waiting</hi> doth not only ſignify a paſſive quietneſs, ſilence, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, but an <hi>active</hi> doing our duty. <hi>Waiting on the Lord, and keeping his way,</hi> are put together, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. we ought not to leave off praying, becauſe (in our apprehenſions at leaſt) our prayers lie by without anſwer, much leſs to ſlacken our courſe of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, but to reſolve as the Church did for <hi>Zions ſake,</hi> ſo for our own ſake, not to <hi>hold our peace;</hi> we have for this an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent preſident in the example of the Church, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44. 17. <hi>All this is come upon us</hi> (ſaith ſhe) <hi>yet have we not forgotten thee, nor dealt falſely in thy Covenant. Our heart is not turned back, neither have our ſteps declined from thy way, though thou haſt ſore broken us in the place of Dragons, and covered us with the ſhadow of death?</hi> then ſhe concludeth with prayer. <hi>v.</hi> 23, 24, 25, 26. <hi>Awake, why ſleepeſt thou?</hi> O Lord! <hi>ariſe, caſt us not off for ever, wherefore hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt thou thy face, and forgetteſt our affliction, and oppreſſion? For our Soul is bowed down to the duſt, our belly cleaveth to the Earth. Ariſe for our help, and redeem us for thy mercy ſake.</hi>

I have already taken notice of the alteration of her ſtile, of her ſo ſudden giving thanks upon the quick return God had made to her prayers. I come now to conſider the mercy or good thing ſhe had received, which ſhe expreſſeth in the ſame meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorical dialect, which ſhe uſeth throughout this Song. <hi>The King hath brought me into his Chambers;</hi> when I at firſt opened the whole verſe, I endeavoured to find out what this <hi>mercy</hi> was, in the receit of which the Spouſe triumpheth in this text. I then conſidered <hi>Chambers,</hi> as places more <hi>lofty</hi> then others, and and of more <hi>privacy</hi> and <hi>ſecrecy,</hi> and from thence concluded; that the Spouſe by this phraſe ſignifieth ſome <hi>ſpecial favours</hi> which ſhe had received from <hi>God,</hi> ſome ſpecial, and more near and intimate degrees of <hi>fellowſhip,</hi> and <hi>communion</hi> with God, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which her <hi>beloved</hi> had taken her. The <hi>Propoſition</hi> I offered from the words for my further explication was this:</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Prop.</note> 
                  <hi>That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath Chambers, in which he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times entertaineth the Souls of his people.</hi> He hath a favour for them all, Rooms in his Houſe for all the ſizes of his people, but he hath Chambers for ſome, or into which he ſometimes takes up the Souls of his Saints; the ſubject of my diſcourſe will be ſuch ſpecial favours, as God ſheweth to ſome Souls, or to the Souls of his people at ſome times. This is evident in holy writ. <hi>Abraham</hi> was called the <hi>Friend of God. Moſes</hi> is called his <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi> emphatically. <hi>Moſes my Servant is dead. David,</hi> the man according to Gods own heart. <hi>Solomon</hi> was named by God <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didiah,</hi> a man beloved of God. There are four degrees in the love of God, as it reſpecteth the Children of men.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He hath a <hi>Philanthropy,</hi> or general love, which he ſheweth towards all; <hi>He leaveth not the Heathen without witneſs.</hi> In him all men <hi>live, move, and have their being,</hi> from him they have fruitful times and ſeaſons, which fill their bellies with food, their
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:61084:191"/>
hearts with gladneſs, their bellies are <hi>filled with his hid treaſure. The patience of God leadeth them to repentance.</hi> The inviſible things of God, even his eternal <hi>power</hi> and <hi>God-head</hi> are made known to them, by his <hi>works of Creation,</hi> by the things which he hath made.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He <hi>hath a more ſpecial love for his Church.</hi> This is ſeen in his more <hi>ſpecial providence,</hi> exerciſed towards his whole Church, which are more watched over, and preſerved by a common providence, then any other body of people are. They have alſo the <hi>Oracles of God,</hi> the <hi>Ordinances of God,</hi> and <hi>means of grace,</hi> and this latter is certainly an effect of the death of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He hath yet a more <hi>ſpecial love for all thoſe within his Church,</hi> who are effectually called, whoſe hearts God hath ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, and ſubdued to himſelf, they are made partakes of more <hi>ſpecial grace,</hi> being called, juſtified, and ſanctified, and ſuch who ſhall hereafter be moſt certainly glorified.</p>
               <p n="4">4.

The queſtion about degrees of glory, is not well agreed amongſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, there are great Divines on either ſide as to that opinion; nor is it a ſmall difficulty to open in what the glory of one Child of God, when he comes in Heaven, ſhall excell anothers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> When it is certain, that they ſhall all <hi>ſee God, inherit his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, be ſatisfied with his likeneſs, and there ſhall be no want to any Soul there,</hi> eſpecially we being taught by our Saviour, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry labourer in the Vineyard ſhall <hi>have his penny.</hi> But yet it is very probably judged by Divines, That in that firmament, as well as in that which is lower, the ſtars ſhall differ one from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother in glory, and that when Chriſt told his Diſciples, they ſhould ſit upon twelve Thrones, judging the twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he by it expreſſed ſome greater degrees of glory, then

ſhall be the portion of his more common Diſciples beſides, that the Scriptures ſpeaking of God's rewarding all men according to their works, compared with the diſproportion which we ſee in the works of Believers, make it yet more probable: So that I muſt confeſs my ſelf very inclinable in this point, to be of the mind of thoſe Divines who think that in the <hi>Manſions of Glory,</hi> there ſhall be <hi>Chambers,</hi> though I am not able to diſtinguiſh them from the <hi>lower Rooms</hi> in thoſe bleſſed <hi>Manſions.</hi> But yet I am not inclinable (ſuppoſing this) to interpret the Spouſe as ſpeaking of them here, but rather judge her by this phraſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning to expreſs her felicity, not diſcerned by the Eye of Faith, which is the Evidence of things not ſeen, but by the <hi>Eye of Senſe,</hi> ſome ſpecial favour now received from God; and I am therefore concerned further to enquire, what theſe favours may be.</p>

               <p n="2">2.

other ſide, he is ſaid to be <hi>abſent</hi> from them, and to be <hi>departed</hi> from them, when he goeth not forth with their Armies, but makes them to fall before their enemies, when he ſends amongſt them famine, and peſtilence, &amp;c. Thus as to particular perſons, as God is ſaid to be preſent with perſons, when he upholdeth their Souls in life, their bodies in health, when he bleſſeth them in their buſineſſes, and relations, and maketh the works of their hands to proſper; ſo he is ſaid to have forſaken them, and to be <hi>departed from them,</hi> when he leaves them to ſickneſſes, blaſts them in their Eſtates, &amp;c. thus Gods preſence, and being with his people, his abſence, forſaking of, and departing from a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or perſon, are often taken in holy writ.

               <p>But then there is a preſence of God with men and women, <hi>with reſpect to the good things of ſpecial grace.</hi> Now theſe things again are ſuch as are either <hi>abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation;</hi> Or, 2.

                  <hi>influences,</hi> and thoſe Souls may be ſaid to be under <hi>deſertions,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken of God, to whom the Lord denieth ſuch degrees of theſe influences, as either themſelves have before enjoyed, or others do enjoy. As to theſe God is very various in his diſpenſations, they being ſuch diſpenſations, as God upon the covenant of grace is left at liberty to diſpenſe out to the Souls of his people, or to with-hold from them according to his own good pleaſure, and wiſdom, and which accordingly he doth diſpenſe out in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſute of the deſign of his own glory, and as according to his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite knowledge and wiſdom, he ſeeth will be moſt for the good of his people; when God diſpenſeth out more of theſe, he is ſaid to be more preſent with the Souls of his people, when he more with-holdeth them, he is ſaid to be abſent, not that at any time he is wholly abſent from the Souls of his people, as to his gracious preſence (for without that they were able to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing) the <hi>ſeed</hi> of God <hi>abiding</hi> in the Soul, muſt be upheld in its life, and cheriſhed by the influence of the Sun of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs upon the Soul; but as God, though he be alwaies preſent in the world, by his <hi>eſſential preſence,</hi> yet doth not alwaies ſhew forth his power in upholding, and preſerving this or that part of it, no not the ſame parts of it, which is the reaſon of that ſickneſs and mortality, with which ſome parts of it are affected more than others, and the ſame parts of it are affected at ſome times more than others. So as to ſpiritual influences, though he alwaies vouchſafeth ſuch a preſence of his gracious influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as ſhall keep up ſpiritual life in the Soul, yet for further gradual influences (the want of which is yet conſiſtent with ſpiritual life in the Soul) the Lord granteth, or with holdeth them, according to his own will, guided by his infinite wiſdom, with reſpect to the great ends of his own glory, and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples good. And the Lords withdrawings of this nature, are the cauſe of all the Souls ſickneſs, and ſpiritual diſtempers, upon this are the grievous complaints of the people of God, of the ſtrength of their corruptions, the violence of temptations, their deadneſs, and inactivity to, &amp; in the operations of the ſpiritual llfe, their heavineſs, ſadneſs, and want of comfort. When the Lord granteth out to any of the Souls of his people more of theſe influences, then he may be ſaid to bring them into his <hi>Chambers;</hi> when they find more <hi>internal ſtrength</hi> to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of their duties, that their meditation of God is more
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:61084:194"/>
ſweet to them, they can <hi>believe</hi> with leſs doubting, pray with more faith, more fervour, leſs diſtraction; when they find more ſtrength againſt motions to ſin, more ability and courage to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for the name of God, when they find their Souls more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to, more free, and chearful in their duty, when they find more ſerenity, peace, and comfort within, than they have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly experienced, then may the Lord be ſaid to have brought them into his <hi>Chambers,</hi> the Chambers of his <hi>preſence,</hi> when theſe abate, and the Soul lives, and no more but lives, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining that it is without ſtrength, ready to be overthrown by every motion of luſt, by every forreign temptation, that the thoughts of God are troubleſome to it, it may be terrible that it moves heavily, it doth ſomething of its duty, but it is rather its task, and burthen, than its pleaſure and delight, its heart is ſad, and heavy, and dejected, in ſuch caſes as theſe. Now God is preſent with the Soul that is his, for he dwelleth in it, but he entertaineth it as it were in his low Rooms. <hi>Cubiculum</hi> (ſaith <hi>Bernard</hi> upon the Text) <hi>eſt locus ubi vere quieſcens &amp; quietus Deus cernitur.</hi> The Chamber is a place where the Soul ſeeth God, quiet, and at reſt. Sometimes the Soul apprehendeth God as it were <hi>returned to his place</hi> (to ſpeak in the Prophets Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect) as it were riſen up from the Soul, and returned to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, only to be found there, by <hi>faſting,</hi> and <hi>weeping,</hi> and <hi>earneſt ſeeking after him;</hi> it apprehends God as <hi>angry,</hi> and not at reſt in it; ſometimes it diſcerns him at <hi>reſt</hi> in it, the Soul can ſay, <hi>Lo this is my God, I have waited for him, I have waited for him, I will rejoice, and be glad in his Salvation,</hi> then the Soul returneth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>its reſt, Pſal.</hi> 116. 7. <hi>Return unto thy reſt O my Soul</hi> (ſaith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid) for the Lord hath dealt graciouſly with thee.</hi> When God is at reſt in the Soul, then is the Soul at reſt within itſelf, then hath the King brought the Soul into his Chambers. <hi>David</hi> when he was under apprehenſions that the Lord ſuſtained him, reſolves to lay himſelf down in <hi>peace,</hi> and <hi>ſleep, Pſal.</hi> 4. 7.

                  <hi>When the Lord raiſeth the Soul to further degrees of ſpiritual-mindedneſs,</hi> and gives the Soul a power further to contemplate him in his Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and goodneſs, then he may be ſaid to have brought the Soul into his <hi>Chambers.</hi> There is a time <hi>when the Soul remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth God, and is troubled</hi> (thus it was with the <hi>Pſalmiſt, Pſal.</hi> 77. 3.) Another time <hi>when the meditation of God is ſweet</hi> to the Soul (ſo it was with <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 104. 34.) when the Soul is able to meditate of God without diſtractions, or diſturbance, and can fit alone, and fancy that it ſeeth even the Heavens o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, and beholdeth the glory of God, and its Redeemers arms open to receive it; and there is another time, when it is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to lift up an Eye to God, nor to behold him with any plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing aſpect. When the Soul is in the former ſtate, then the King may be ſaid to have brought the Soul into his Chambers, but this the obſerving perſon will ſee ſell under the aforementioned conſideration.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, There are yet ſome other Chambers, into which God ſometimes brings the Souls of his people, in the deſcription of which I will not enlarge, becauſe they are more peculiar <hi>Cloſets</hi> into which God hath taken, and may (for ought I know) yet take the Souls of ſome particular Servants of his, into which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in general cannot expect to be brought, they being ſuch as God in all times hath been pleaſed, but to take ſome few of his people into, and generally ſuch, as he hath deſigned to make ſome more publick uſe of in the world; I may call them <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of particular inſtruction.</hi> Before God had fully revealed his will in the holy Scriptures, written for our inſtruction, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation. God was pleaſed at <hi>ſundry times, and in divers manners</hi> (as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 1.) <hi>to ſpeak unto the Fathers by the Prophets.</hi> Perſons whom God admitted to a more ſpecial degree of fellowſhip, and communion with him, and ſometimes more plainly, ſometimes more <hi>typically,</hi> and darkly to inſtruct them concerning his mind and will, both concerning what they were to do, and to avoid, and concerning what God intended to do in the world, or ſome particular place in it; into theſe Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers he took <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he did not hide from him what he intended to do to <hi>Sodom,</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> when he took him up into
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:61084:195"/>
the <hi>Mount,</hi> and there gave him his law, inſtructing him in his, mind and will, that he might inſtruct the people under his charge, in theſe Chambers the Lord entertained <hi>Samuel, Elijah, Eliſha; Gad,</hi> and <hi>Nathan,</hi> and all the <hi>Seers,</hi> and Prophets of whom you read in the Old <hi>Teſtament,</hi> and after them the bleſſed <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and ſome primitive Chriſtians. But the bringing of any Souls now into theſe Chambers, is no matter of our faith, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation; though we muſt not <hi>limit the holy one of Iſrael,</hi> nor hath (that we know) he any where as to this limited himſelf; indeed as to one part of the revelation he hath: None can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, nor have any <hi>new revelation of duty,</hi> for the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are a perfect rule, and able to make the man of God wiſe to Salvation. But we may have a fuller <hi>revelation of what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed,</hi> and thus doubtleſs, there is a further diſcovery of duty in this, than in former ages, no <hi>new light</hi> of truth, but a new light in our Souls to diſcern the revelations of the word. And doubtleſs there may be to ſome particular Souls, ſome more revelations of what God intends to do in the world, and as to his or their particular circumſtances than others have, they are things we cannot expect, hope or believe for, but what ſome may receive, and for the tryal of the truth of them, the iſſue muſt be expected, and from that the truth of their revelations, and prophecies, muſt be judged. And it ſeemeth by the anſwer of the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> to <hi>Hananiah,</hi> that under the old diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, this was a piece of the Judgment, <hi>Jer.</hi> 28. 8, 9. <hi>The Prophets</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>which have been before me, and thee of old, propheſied both againſt many Countries, and againſt great Kingdoms, of War, and of peſtilence, the Prophet which propheſieth of peace, when the word of the Prophet ſhall come to paſs, then ſhall the Prophet be known, that the Lord hath truly ſent him.</hi> Yet they muſt doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs at that time have had ſome other way to diſcern a true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet from a falſe Prophet, how elſe could they have been char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with ſin, in not hearkning to their voice, unleſs it were in ſuch things which they required them to do, or to avoid, in force of the law of God given them by <hi>Moſes,</hi> for though ſome of them wrought miracles, as <hi>Moſes, Elijah, Eliſha,</hi> yet we read no ſuch thing of <hi>Iſaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel,</hi> &amp;c. But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever that way was, it is hidden from us, &amp; though I dare not but ſay that God may yet to ſome particular Servants of his, not only more <hi>fully</hi> and <hi>clearly</hi> reveal what he hath in his word re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed,
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:61084:195"/>
ſo as they may more clearly underſtand the Scriptures, and be more able to teach others, but alſo reveal his mind and will as to future contingencies, with reference to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or Perſons; yet I know no reaſon any hath to expect, or pray for any ſuch Revelation; nor any others to believe it; but yet when the thing thoſe Prophets prophecy, comes to paſs, then ſhall we know that the Lord hath ſent them. But though theſe be ſpecial degrees of communion, ſpecial favours, which the Lord may vouchſafe to ſome Souls, yet theſe are not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly thoſe Chambers, of which the Spouſe here ſpeaketh. I have before told you what I judge thoſe to be.</p>
               <p>Will any one that heareth me, now ſay unto me, Why will the Lord thus pleaſe to do? 1. <hi>Why will he bring any Souls into his Chambers;</hi> allow them a nearer fellowſhip, and communion with him, then he will allow unto othe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

He will do it to ſome to manifeſt that <hi>he hath a delight in the Sons of men;</hi> the wiſe man thus ſpeaketh of Chriſt from all Eternity, as <hi>Rejoycing in the habitable part of the Earth, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his delights with the Sons of men.</hi> Who can give a reaſon of love, and its motions in the creature? the affections of ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to others (as we daily ſee) are inaccountable things; we find our own Souls, cleaving to ſome Neighbours, ſome Friends, and that we take a greater delight, and complacency in ſeeing them, hearing them diſcourſe, being with them, and having them with us, then in others. Others can give no account of it, nor ſee any reaſon for it, and it may be we our ſelves can give our ſelves no great account of it, but ſo we do, though we know not why; and ſhall any one think to call God to account, to know why he ſheweth more favour to one Soul, then to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? how cometh God to be more a debtor to his Creature, then man is to his Neighbour? what Man or Woman lives with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their more intimate, and ſpecial friends? What <hi>Prince</hi> (tho never ſo ingenuous, and good natured, and kind to all his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects) is without his more particular, and ſpecial favourites? Chriſt as God bleſſed for ever; before ever that he had aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med our nature, he had a delight in the Sons of men, but upon his taking unto him our nature, we cannot but apprehend him more
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:61084:196"/>
ſpecially inclined, he therefore <hi>took our fleſh, that he might be touched with the ſeeling of our infirmities,</hi> Heb. 2. 17. And in all things (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>it behoved him to be made like unto us, that he might be a merciful, and ſaithful High Prieſt.</hi> Chriſt thus being not only ingaged by the infinite goodneſs of the Divine Nature, to a communication of his goodneſs; but alſo by his choice, and aſſumption of the humane nature, engaged to a <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the Sons of Men,</hi> though conſidering his Majeſty and greatneſs, it behoved him not to make every Soul a Favourite, taking it up into the neareſt degrees of communion, and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with himſelf; yet it behoved him to make choice of ſome Souls, to whom he will more fully, and freely make known himſelf in the riches of his grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, He is concerned to it <hi>

                     </gap> point of faithfulneſs,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his promiſes. God hath given us many great, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious promiſes; ſome concerning this life, ſome reſpecting that which is to come, we have promiſes of <hi>ſpecial providence,</hi> ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial <hi>protection from dangers, ſupport</hi> under them, <hi>deliverance</hi> from them, promiſes of <hi>ſpecial grace,</hi> manifeſtative love, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 21. <hi>I will love them, and manifeſt my ſelf unto them,</hi> &amp;c. promiſes of <hi>comfort, ſtrength,</hi> &amp;c. Now theſe promiſes are not made good to every Soul, at all times, but it is neceſſary (to uphold the Lords faithfulneſs) that they ſhould be made good to ſome Souls, and at ſome times; by this we know, that none of his words ſhall fail, that his promiſes are in, and through Chriſt all of them, <hi>yea,</hi> and <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>By this the Lord alſo incourageth others to their duty.</hi> It is ſad, that we ſhould not be willing to ſerve God for nothing, at leaſt without ſenſible reward; but ſo croſt is our duty to the grain of our fleſh, ſo many are our temptations, and diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements, that even the moſt ſpiritual Souls muſt have their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements to duty from ſenſible rewards, whiles we think that every labourer in Gods Vineyard ſhall have his penny, we are apt to think, it is of no avail for us to labour more then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. God is therefore pleaſed (though one mans penny in glory may be brighter then anothers) to incourage us alſo with ſenſible rewards in this life; one Chriſtian ſhall have more free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and liberty in his Spirit, then another, more quiet and peace in his Spirit then another he ſhall find more ſtrength un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his duty then another.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="383" facs="tcp:61084:196"/>
If any further ask why the Lord doth not pleaſe to deal thus with all, who yet truly love, and fear him; we cannot enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Gods ſecrets, or pretend to give an account of Gods moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. I ſhall only ſhew you that it is reaſonable, that God ſhould not ſo deal with all, but with ſome only, and that he ſhould not at all times deal alike with the ſame Souls.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>In regard of our own incertainty, and mutability,</hi> and <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion to others;</hi> though we be made partakers of the ſame ſpecial ſaving grace that they are, there is nothing more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent upon obſervation, then that ſome walk more cloſe with God, are more in prayer, more in reading, and hearing the Word of God, more in ſpiritual contemplation, and meditation, more reſerved from the world, more watchful upon their own hearts and waies: nay, that the ſame Chriſtian hath not alwaies the ſame heart for God, nor doth walk with God the ſame pace, nor by the ſame ſteps. Now though the Lord doth not diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute rewards ſtrictly, according to our merits, yet he diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth <hi>puniſhments,</hi> according to our <hi>demerits,</hi> and the withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe gradual influences, being ſpecies of puniſhments, it is very reaſonable that as our hearts, and ways are uneven be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, ſo his ways in theſe diſpenſations ſhould alſo be uneven towards us, that in the <hi>darkneſs</hi> of our Spirits, we might ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times read the <hi>darkneſs</hi> of our looſe, and ſinful converſation. God thus puniſheth our pride, our hypocrify, our neglect of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, our wilful yielding to temptations, to which we might have made a better oppoſition. And upon the withdrawing of theſe influences, we have all juſt reaſon to ſearch, and try our own hearts, and to reflect upon our own ways, to ſearch out (if we can) the cauſe, why when others are in the Mount with God, we are ſtill kept in the valley, while they are in the <hi>Chambers,</hi> we are kept in the lower Rooms, this is certain, that though poſſibly the puniſhment of ſin be not alwaies the next cauſe, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God to ſuch diſpenſations, yet we have alwaies reaſon to ſuſpect it, having our Souls never ſo free from ſin, but we may find enough to juſtify God in them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It may be reaſonable that God ſhould thus deal with us, <hi>that we might know</hi> (as I told you in handling the other Doctrine) <hi>that his grace is free,</hi> and he a free agent in the diſpenſation of it. Not only <hi>firſt grace,</hi> but <hi>further grace</hi> alſo in God is free; indeed elſe it could not be <hi>grace,</hi> we ſhould never underſtand the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:61084:197"/>
of grace, if it were equally diſpenſed. We in our little mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtations of our love to our fellow creatures, challenge to our ſelves a liberty, and think our ſelves free to ſhew it where we will. God certainly muſt in juſtice be allowed the ſame, which we ſhould not be brought to ſee and acknowledge, if we ſaw God treating all his Servants, and at all times to the ſame rate, and in the ſame degree.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It may be the mind of God <hi>to make a trial of his peoples grace,</hi> to draw forth ſome habits into acts, which would not be ſo exerciſed, if ſome of his people were not under different diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations, and the ſame Souls ſometimes variouſly exerciſed. The Soul that is with the Lord in his <hi>Chambers,</hi> is more a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver from God, then a giver to him. It gives him the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of <hi>its ſaith,</hi> in its reflex act, which indeed is not very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly an act of faith. It offereth up unto God, the ſacrifice of <hi>joy, of praiſe, and thanksgiving,</hi> it followeth here in the next words; <hi>we will be glad, and rejoice in thee.</hi> It may exerciſe its love of <hi>complacency,</hi> and delight in God. But all this while, where is the exerciſe of the Souls <hi>panting,</hi> and <hi>breathing</hi> after God, of its <hi>faith of adherence</hi> unto, and <hi>dependence</hi> upon God? of its <hi>hope in God,</hi> and patient expectation of, and waiting for God? where is the exerciſe of its <hi>patience,</hi> and <hi>ſubmiſſion to God</hi> under ſeverer providences? It is reaſonable that God ſhould ſee all thoſe bleſſed habits which he hath infuſed into the Soul; drawn forth into act.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The good <hi>Judas</hi> asked Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 14. 22. <hi>Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifeſt thy ſelf to us, and not to the world.</hi> Chriſt told him, becauſe they <hi>loved him more,</hi> and kept his <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments better.</hi> There is the ſame reaſon to be aſſigned, why Chriſt will manifeſt himſelf to ſome of his Saints, more then to others, becauſe at ſome times the love of his people more manifeſteth itſelf to him by a ſtricter keeping of his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the love of ſome good men is greater for God. Now to encourage men (as I before ſaid) to perfect holineſs in his fear, though he will give them all glory, yet ſome ſhall in this life have Gods goodneſs made to paſs before them, more then others, that others may ſee what it is to be much with God.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Laſtly, <hi>God often doth it for the good of others.</hi> And indeed this generally is the reaſon of that more ſpecial communion with God, which ſome have, more then others, as to the <hi>Revelation</hi>
                  <pb n="385" facs="tcp:61084:197"/>
                  <hi>of his mind and will</hi> unto them; thus God would not hide from <hi>Abraham,</hi> the thing which he had to do againſt <hi>Sodom,</hi> becauſe <hi>Abraham</hi> had a Family to inſtruct; God taketh <hi>Moſes</hi> up into the Mount, and revealeth his mind, and will unto him, that he might teach the People over whom God had ſet him his Statutes, and Judgments; the ſame reaſon is to be given of Gods <hi>ſpecial</hi> communications to the Prophets under the Old, and the Apoſtles under the New Teſtament, and doubtleſs the ſame reaſon is to be aſſigned for Gods more full revelation of his mind and will already revealed in the Scripture, to his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Servants in the Miniſtry, who generally know more of the ſenſe of Scriptures, and the mind, and will of God revealed in them then other <hi>Chriſtians</hi> do, becauſe God deſigneth that the <hi>Prieſts lips</hi> ſhould preſerve knowledge, and the people ſhould enquire at them; and there is the ſame reaſon to be given for ſome more then ordinary influences of grace upon ſome Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians Souls. See 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 4. <hi>Bleſſed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comforts, who comforteth us in all tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them, which are in any trouble by the comfort where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we our ſelves are comforted of God.</hi> God hath made us one for another, and in the diſpenſings out of his own gifts, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, he hath reſpect unto the ſerviceableneſs both of <hi>Miniſters,</hi> and others, one to another.</p>
               <p>But this is ſufficient for the Doctrinal part of this diſcourſe.</p>

The Son that was alwaies at home with the Father. <hi>v.</hi> 28, 29. was angry, and would not go into his Fathers Houſe, no not though his Father intreated him, becauſe the Father had <hi>killed a ſatted Calf</hi> to entertain his Prodigal Brother returning; our Saviour doubtleſs intended in that parable to check the Jews envy at the kindneſs Chriſt was about to ſhew to the Gentiles, or did at that time ſhew to Harlots, to Publicans, and Sinners; but it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth further, we ſhall find all our hearts too prone to this, to repine at the further manifeſtations of the love of God to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Souls, then unto ours. If I do not miſconceive him, <hi>David</hi> ſeems in this to have failed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. 2, 3, 4. <hi>O my God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I cry in the day time, but thou heareſt not, and in the night ſeaſon, and am not ſilent.

To ſilence this corruption ſo exceedingly natural to us, let me offer a few things to thy thoughts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt ſhall be <hi>the Lords Prerogative, to ſhew mercy where he will ſhew mercy.</hi> This our Saviour hints me in the Parable of the Labourers ſent into the <hi>Vineyard, Mat.</hi> 20. 15. when thoſe who had wrought all the day, received their penny, in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to thoſe who had wrought but a few hours, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, the Maſter of the Vineyard ſaies to them. <hi>May I not do with my own what I pleaſe?</hi> All influxes of grace are Gods own. It is a prerogative that every one of us claims for himſelf, to diſpoſe of his love, (eſpecially ſome degrees of it) as we pleaſe; why ſhould we deny that to God, which every one of us claimeth to himſelf? The Prince will not allow the Subject to diſpoſe of
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:61084:198"/>
his favour, no more will the Father allow it to his Child; why ſhould we think God is not at the ſame liberty? eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That <hi>God by it doth us no wrong.</hi> You have this in the ſame Text, <hi>Friend, I do thee no wrong, Mat.</hi> 20. 15. This now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth upon this <hi>hypotheſis,</hi> that the grace of God cannot be merited by any; he that hath the greateſt manifeſtations of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine love, hath them freely, &amp; he who hath the leaſt diſcoveries of it, hath what he hath freely, without any preceding merit in himſelf. If God will let one of his Children walk in the light of his countenance, and another to walk in the dark, and ſee no light, if he will treat one in Chambers, another in a low, and more common Room, yet he doth not wrong to any. There is no injuſtice in the caſe; in appearance to us, he ſheweth indeed more ſeverity to the one, and more goodneſs to the other, but he is unjuſt to neither, becauſe neither hath merited any thing that he receiveth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>God hath with held from thee nothing for which he agreed with thee.</hi> This is a third thing which the Maſter of the Vineyard told thoſe labourers that repined, becauſe they had not more then thoſe who had laboured leſs, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 15. <hi>Did I not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>agree with thee for a peny?</hi> we can lay claim to nothing of anothers, but either upon the plea of a <hi>Native right;</hi> thus the Child laies claim to his Patrimonial Eſtate, as heir at law; or <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of purchaſe,</hi> by vertue of ſome compact or agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or ſome valuable conſideration given him for it; we can lay no claim to the Grace of God, as our Patrimonial right, as Heirs to it, we are indeed called <hi>Heirs,</hi> but it is by adoption; nor upon the account of any valuable conſideration given; who hath given firſt to God, and it ſhall be repaid to him again? All the claim we can lay to any thing either of Grace, or Glory, is upon the account of a <hi>Covenant</hi> that God hath made with us, or with Chriſt on our behalf, and by us <hi>accepted,</hi> when we come to believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. The queſtion is, what God hath agreed with us for, he hath agreed with us for a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. <hi>Fear not little Flock</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>it is your Fathers will to give you a Kingdom. He that believes on me, is not condemned</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) he is paſſed <hi>from death to life.</hi> He hath agreed with us <hi>for all that grace, and mercy which is neceſſary to bring us to this Kingdom.</hi> That he will give us a <hi>clean heart,</hi> and a <hi>new heart,</hi>
                  <pb n="388" facs="tcp:61084:199"/>
that we ſhall be <hi>kept by the power of God through faith to ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> But where hath the Lord agreed with the Souls of any of his people for equal meaſures of his manifeſtative love? Nay, plainly, God in the Covenant of his Grace hath reſerved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a liberty to chaſtife, and afflict his people, either for the probation of Grace, or for the puniſhment of ſin, and this is one ſpecies of affliction, by which God doth both try the faith and patience, and alſo correct the errors, and miſcarriages of the beſt of his people. But you will ſay, is not <hi>manifeſtative love</hi> promiſed? I anſwer it is, but ſo are not the <hi>meaſures of it,</hi> nor yet the <hi>particular time</hi> for the diſcovery of it. 2. <hi>It is but the matter of a conditional promiſe,</hi> John 14 21. <hi>He that hath my Commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me, and he that loveth me, ſhall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and manifeſt my ſelf unto him.</hi> Pſal. 50. 21.—<hi>To him that ordereth his converſation aright, I will ſhew the Salvation of God.</hi> The promiſes of <hi>Eternal life, and Salvation,</hi> are made to <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>holineſs,</hi> without which (both which) <hi>none ſhall ſee God,</hi> but not to degrees of the one, or of the other, a <hi>weak faith</hi> may bring a Soul to Heaven, ſo will an upright and ſincere heart, though incumbred with many luſtings of the fleſh againſt the Spirit; but the caſe is otherwiſe as to ſome degrees of the <hi>mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtative love</hi> of God, which much depend both upon degrees of faith, and degrees of holineſs alſo. Our Saviour hath deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined doubts, and fears, indications of little faith, and reaſon will determine them inconſiſtent with much joy, peace, and comfort in the Soul; that holineſs in ſome good degree is neceſſary to our peace, will appear to any Soul, that conſiders, that nothing but ſin will break our peace with God. So that if thou beeſt not conſcious to thy ſelf, that thy faith is as ſtrong as others, and thy ways as perfect before God as theirs, thou haſt no reaſon to expect the ſame manifeſtations of Divine love; No; tho thou beeſt one who truly believeſt, and truly loveſt, and feareſt God, God hath agreed with every believer for eternal life and ſalvation, for pardon of ſin, and a clean heart, and the upholding of him by his power unto ſalvation: But he hath not agreed with every ſuch Soul for the ſame meaſures of peace and comfort, the ſame degrees of his manifeſtative love, he hath reſerved himſelf a liberty to reward thoſe with theſe more ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial favours, who walk moſt cloſely, and exactly with him in their converſations. Thoſe therefore who find their Souls under
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:61084:199"/>
temptations, to repine at God, for doing more for others then for them, ſhould do well to reflect upon themſelves, and to conſider whether the faith of thoſe others be not more ſtrong, and their walking with God more cloſe and exact then theirs; if it be, they are not to wonder that their Souls are more highly favoured, and more treated in Gods Chambers.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But Secondly, <hi>There being no merit in any thing we do or ſuffer, at Gods command,</hi> why ſhould we <hi>think God obliged thus to reward the higheſt degrees of faith or holineſs?</hi> What if God will hear one believers prayers ſooner then anothers, what if he will give one ſuch Soul more peace then another, who ſhall ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him what doeſt thou, or why am I thus, and others are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe? we certainly ought to allow the freeſt, and moſt ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign agent, what priviledge we every one claim for our ſelves, with reference to our Children, Servants, Friends, whiles every of us receives more then we deſerve, what reaſon have we to repine, becauſe others have more then we.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I beſeech you conſider <hi>whether this fruit floweth not from a root of Pride.</hi> Why ſhould my Eye be evil, becauſe anothers is good? Why ſhould I repine, becauſe God is kinder (as I think) to another Soul, then to me, if I did not ſecretly think that I had deſerved as much, and as well as thoſe, if not better? The humble Soul looks upon itſelf as meriting nothing, and therefore prizeth every influence of Divine love. The Dogs eat the <hi>crums,</hi> ſaid the poor Woman. I am not worthy that thou ſhouldſt come under my roof (ſaith the Centurion) therefore ſpeak the word only. Now if this be thy root of thy complaint, be aſſured, there is not a more bitter one in all the wilderneſs of nature. There is no Soul at further diſtance from obtaining at the hand of God, then that Soul that challengeth God as a debtor to his Creature, if thy Soul ſaith, as <hi>Haman,</hi> to whom ſhould the King more delight to honour then me, thou art like enough to meet with as great diſappointment as he did; God ſets himſelf to pull down the Soul, that exalts itſelf above meaſure. God will keep Souls ſwell'd with this tumor, with Thorns in their fleſh for their buffetings, it is enough if they find his grace ſufficient for them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If it doth not argue this, yet it ſpeaketh a <hi>diſcontent at, and diſſatisfaction with Gods methods in the conduct, and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thy Soul, in order to that end to which he hath appointed thee.</hi> This frame of ſpirit is ſinful enough, it is indeed a branch
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:61084:200"/>
that groweth out of the root of pride; Gods general promiſe is, <hi>that he will with-hold no good thing from them that live uprightly, and that all things ſhall work together for the good of them that love God;</hi> but we muſt leave the judgment of good to the wiſdom of God, who knoweth what is good for us, while we repine at Gods diſpenſations, we either ſhew our diſtruſt, and unbelief in theſe promiſes, or aſſume the judgment of good to our ſelves, paramount to the judgment of God. No ſin more provokes God then this of murmuring, and repining. It was the great ſin of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> which at laſt provoked God to ſwear in his wrath they ſhould never enter into his reſt. Let us therefore learn thankfully to acknowledge what grace we have received, and with ſilence, and patience to wait for what further manifeſtations of it we deſire, and judge our Souls to ſtand in need of.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <note place="margin">2. Br. Inft.</note> 2. Hath the King of glory, whom we ſerve Chambers, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he treateth the Souls of his Subjects, not only <hi>Manſions,</hi> but <hi>Chambers,</hi> further degrees of gracious influxes, &amp; manifeſtations. Let us then learn from hence; <hi>That no man ſerves God in any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of ſervice for nothing;</hi> ſome indeed ſhall have greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of reward then others, none ſhall ſerve him for nothing, there is a reward for every righteous Soul.

If any will come in to Gods Service in the morning, and work in the heat of the day, and labour for God more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, he ſhall not loſe his reward; nay, he ſhall be rewarded according to his work, as there are degrees of active working Grace, ſo there are degrees of manifeſtative love, and this by the way.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It is a great encouragement to thoſe that are young, to turn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ways of the Lord betimes. Joſiah,</hi> and <hi>Timothy,</hi> and <hi>Enoch,</hi> were all of them ſuch as began early to walk with God. Of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>Chron.</hi> 2. 34. That when he was but eight years old, he began to ſeek after the God of <hi>David</hi> his Father, what ſpecial favour he had from God, his ſtory will tell you; he was early taken into the Chambers of glory, and while he was upon the Earth, God treated him in his Chambers, he would not in his days bring the intended evil upon <hi>Judah. Enoch walked with</hi>

                  <hi>God,</hi> the Text ſaith he was not, <hi>for God took him.

               <p n="2">2. <hi>It is a great incouragement to men and women to put out them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves mightily for God,</hi> to love the Lord (according to the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the firſt, and great Commandment) <hi>with all their Soul, and all their ſtrength, &amp; all their might,</hi> God hath degrees of love to reward degrees of holineſs &amp; ſervice, &amp; though poſſibly there may be ſome rare inſtances, wherein the wiſdom of God (as unſearchable) is to be adored, and not to be found out, and we may ſee ſome, who appear to us more exemplary in holineſs then others, yet clouded under darker diſpenſations, walking in the dark, and ſeeing no light, yet ordinarily it is otherwiſe, thoſe who walk moſt in the light of holineſs, have more of the light of Gods countenance, enjoy moſt peace, and have moſt mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtations of Gods ſpecial love; and this now lets us ſee what a difference there is betwixt the ſervice of God, and the ſervice of the Devil, or the ſervice of the world, many a one ſerves the world, and gets little, and thoſe that make themſelves leaſt drudges to it get moſt of it; he that ſerves the Devil in ſerving corruption, the more he toils in that ſervice, the more torment he hath. But the more a man ſerves God, the more peace, the more inward reſt and ſweetneſs he hath.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>This diſcourſe may give ſome relief to ſuch Chriſtians whoſe hearts are right with God, but yet their attainments are not propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to others.</hi> The King hath not brought them into his Chambers, indeed the fault of this may be in our ſelves, and where it is ſo, we have reaſon to blame our ſelves, and to ſit down in ſilence, and endeavour for the time to come to mend our pace in the ways of holineſs; there are Stairs, by which Chriſtians uſually aſcend into theſe Chambers, come up (I mean) into this near degree of communion with God, if we will not do what in us lies to climb up thoſe ſteps which God hath made for us, by which we may aſcend into theſe Chambers, we muſt blame our ſelves, if we abide below: But this is not alwaies the cauſe, in ſome caſes we muſt have recourſe to Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, and muſt reſt in this. <hi>Even ſo O Father, becauſe it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth thee.</hi> Some Souls are dignified with a ſpecial communion,

and familiarity with God, ſo was <hi>Abraham, Moſes, David,</hi> yet poſſibly if we look into the records we have of their lives, we ſhall find more blots in ſome of them, then in ſome others, who we do not read were taken up into ſuch eminent degrees of favour. We cannot give juſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and accounts of all Gods acts of Grace, it is enough <hi>that God wills them.</hi> In the mean time, if we find but a good hope through grace, an heart changed, and cleaving to God, if we can ſay with <hi>Peter,</hi> Lord thou that knoweſt all things, knoweſt that we love thee, though we cannot boaſt of ſuch <hi>ſpecial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences as others,</hi> nor of ſuch <hi>viſions of peace,</hi> nor of ſo <hi>quick an hearing of our prayers,</hi> tho we dare not pretend to be ſuch fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites of Heaven, yet let us not be diſcouraged, poſſibly as to us the Lords time is not yet come, poſſibly it never will come, God is a great Soveraign, and unqueſtionably free as to theſe things, he knows what is beſt for us, he will deny no good thing to us We may ſay of the whole Family of God, as the <hi>Queen of Sheba</hi> ſaid of <hi>Solomons,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 10. 8. <hi>Happy are thy Men, happy are theſe thy Servants, which ſtand continually before thee, and heaṙ thy wiſdom.</hi> There are ſome of Gods Servants, that as to theſe enjoyments are more happy then others, but there are none but are happy, none but have reaſon for ever to admire the difference which God hath made betwixt them, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; to admire what God hath done for their Souls, bringing them out of the horrible Pit, if they have not, if they cannot ſee reaſon to rejoice in ſuch a proſpect of Heaven as othershave, yet they have reaſon to rejoice in an equal deliverance from Hell.</p>

I will open it in two particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Certainly they ought not to deſpond, and be dejected, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude againſt themſelves, as if they had no ſhare in the love of God,</hi> much leſs to repine, and murmur againſt God. Againſt mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring I offered you ſome conſiderations under the firſt branch of application. Againſt condemning your ſelves, or concluding againſt the goodneſs of your ſpiritual ſtate, I ſhall offer ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing now. There is no ground at all for any ſuch concluſion from theſe providences. The Childs right to the Father is not to be determined from the portion, much leſs from any particular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the Fathers affection, if the Child be begotten by the Father, if owned by him as his Child, this is enough, tho ſome other Child may have more ſmiles, and ſome particular expreſſions of kindneſs which it wanteth. If a Chriſtian hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny evidence, that he is born again, not of the <hi>will of the fleſh,</hi> nor <hi>of the will of man, but of the will of God,</hi> born again of the Spirit, by <hi>the incorruptible Seed of the Word,</hi> this is enough to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title him to a Sonſhip, if he hath <hi>received the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> this <hi>John</hi> 1. 12. gives him a right to be called the Child of God, and this <hi>new birth</hi> is diſcoverable by the new features in
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:61084:202"/>
the Souls face, the Souls aſſimilation to God in holineſs. If theſe things be found, it is a moſt unreaſonable concluſion to conclude againſt thy Sonſhip, for want of ſome ſpecial favours beſtowed upon others, and not upon thee; ſo as there is no ground for thy reprobating thy ſelf upon this account, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding againſt thy ſpiritual ſtate, becauſe of thy want of ſome degrees of ſpiritual priviledges by others enjoyed; nor haſt thou more ground to <hi>deſpond,</hi> and to <hi>deject</hi> thy ſelf, as if thou never ſhouldſt attain what thou haſt not as yet attained. <hi>David</hi> ſets us a rare example in this caſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42. 5. <hi>Why art thou caſt down O my Soul, why art thou disquieted within me, hope thou in God, for I ſhall yet praiſe him for the help of his countenance.</hi> The longeſt night hath a morning following, there commonly is a circulation in Divine Providence, and as to the Soul of man, day, and night, Summer, and Winter, follow one another, as by a Covenant, he that doth not grieve willingly, nor willingly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict the Children of men, will not be alwaies cruſhing the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners of the Earth, nor ſuffer the Souls which he hath made to fail before him.</p>

                  <note place="margin">2. Br.</note> 2. As thy condition will prompt thee to endeavour to amend it, and to make the caſe of thy Soul more eaſy; ſo I would have <hi>thee look upon it as thy duty.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> had not attained, but he <hi>forgetting what was behind, preſſed forward to what was before, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the price of the high calling.</hi> It is the ſtate of our Souls, that we are not perfect, neither as to <hi>action,</hi> nor as to <hi>fruition,</hi> but it is all our duty to ſtrive after perfection, both after a perfection with reſpect to action, which the Apoſtle calls a <hi>perfecting holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the fear of the Lord,</hi> and a <hi>perfection as to fruition,</hi> as to the enioyment of God, you have heard that the King of Glory hath Chambers, in which he entertaineth ſome of his peoples Souls, admitting them to a fuller, further, and ſweeter enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of himſelf then others have. Let therefore no Chriſtian ſit down fully ſatisfied, till he get up into theſe Chambers I have ſhewed you a Chriſtian ought to be ſo far ſatisfied, as if God plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to chain him for a time in a lower room (my meaning is to lay a neceſſity upon him to live beneath theſe Mountains) not to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine &amp; murmur againſt God, not to conclude againſt his ſpiritual ſtate, and intereſt in God, not to deſpond, and defect himſelf,</hi> and conclude that, becauſe it is now dark, it ſhall never be light with him, but yet he ought not to be ſo far ſatisfied, as not to look after
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:61084:203"/>
higher degrees of enjoyment of, and communion with God. There are all the arguments imaginable to be pleaded in this caſe. Whether from <hi>profit,</hi> or <hi>pleaſure,</hi> or <hi>honour,</hi> &amp;c. But thoſe are ſo obvious, that I ſhall but waſt time to inlarge upon them. Every Soul that hath any ſpiritual ſenſe, will acknowledge the deſirableneſs of this. But will ſome Souls ſay, what ſhall we do, that we may attain them. I have but four things to offer in this caſe, with which I will conclude.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Study to abound in <hi>active grace.</hi> The grace I am ſpeaking of is that grace wherein man is partly <hi>paſſive.</hi> Active grace is that by which we are inabled to our duty in obedience to the will of God; the Stairs by which Souls aſcend to the <hi>Kings Chambers,</hi> mentioned in the Text (as I have interpreted it) are the ſteps of univerſal ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, which the Apoſtle calls, an <hi>holineſs in all manner of converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> The promiſe of Gods ſhewing his <hi>Salvation, Pſal.</hi> 50. 21. is made <hi>to him that ordereth his converſation aright, and the promiſe of</hi> Gods <hi>maniſeſting</hi> himſelf to his peoples Souls, is made to them <hi>that love Chriſt, and keep his Commandments.</hi> It is true, God ſometimes uſeth his prerogative, and hides his face from the moſt pious, and holy Souls, for a time, and ſhutteth out their ſupplications from him, you have inſtances in holy writ, as well as in our daily converſe, but it is paſt all controverſy, that thoſe enjoy moſt of God who walk moſt with God, and the cloſeſt walking is the moſt ſweet and comfortable walking. Study there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to excell in holineſs; that's the firſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Behave thy ſelf well in the lower Rooms.</hi> Look to thy ſelf, while God keeps thee in a dark condition, that thou doſt not add to thine own Chains, and lengthen the hours of thy dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; affliction is Gods School, by which he fits us for conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Doſt thou ask me what I mean by behaving thy ſelf well? I anſwer ſhort. 1, <hi>Being watchful,</hi> and ſtriving againſt ſin, thoſe corruptions eſpecially, which thou ſhalt diſcern moſt buſie in ſuch an hour, ſuch as murmuring, unbelief, impatience, &amp;c. 2. <hi>Keeping up thy hope and ſaith in God,</hi> ſo did <hi>David</hi> (as I ſhewed you) <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42. 5. Bleſſed are they ſaith our Saviour, who have not ſeen, and yet believed. 3. <hi>Humbly</hi> acknowledging thine ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, thy unworthineſs to receive the leaſt mercy, or look of grace from God. 4. <hi>Panting &amp; thirſting</hi> after fuller degrees of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God; thus <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 63. 1, 2. <hi>My Soul longeth, my fleſh thirſteth for thee, to ſee thy power, and thy glory,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <pb n="397" facs="tcp:61084:203"/>
3. <hi>Abſtract thy ſelf as much as thou canſt from the world.</hi> You ſhall obſerve that the Servants of God have choſen <hi>Mountains</hi> places of ſolitude, and removed from the noiſe of the world, when they deſigned any acts of more ſpecial communion with God, ſo Chriſt often went <hi>into a Mountain to pray.</hi> And God oft choſe ſuch places more ſpecially to communicate his mind to his people. It was in the Mount God talkt with <hi>Moſes, face to face, as a man talks with his friend.</hi> Divines have obſerved that thoſe Perſons who have enjoyed moſt of God, have been, ſuch as have been (I will not ſay moſt, but) much in contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, which brought contemplation afterward into a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, and a contemplative life to be cried up beyond all ſenſe or reaſon.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Prop.</note> Jeſus Chriſt, and the manifeſtations of his love to believers Souls, particularly in anſwering prayers, are the ſingular objects of their joy, and rejoycing. <hi>In order both to the explication and confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Propoſition, I will guide you a little into the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the nature of Joy, 2. Conſider</hi> how Chriſt can be the object of the believers joy, <hi>and is more the object of his joy, then of another mans. 3.</hi> How he is the ſpecial ſingular ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of their joy.</p>
               <p>Take joy conſidered in itſelf, it is but a natural plant, a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er God hath given to every reaſonable Soul, the object of it is ſome good, to which it is in ſome degree united, and it is greater or leſſer, according to the nature of the good, or the degree of the apprehenſion. There is in all joy, <hi>ſatisfaction,</hi> and <hi>reſt,</hi> and ſomething of <hi>muſick, or melody.</hi>

There is in all joy ſomething of</hi> muſick <hi>and</hi> melody, <hi>hence that phraſe of</hi> leaping for joy, <hi>hence ſinging and ſhouting, are the natural expreſſions of joy; thus joy may be deſcribed to be</hi> a natural power, or inclination of the Soul, by which having more perfectly, or imperfectly obtained an union with the object which it

               <p>Two things are required to make an adequate obiect of this joy. 1. <hi>The thing muſt be good.</hi> 2. <hi>We muſt have ſome apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion both of the goodneſs of it, and our union with, and intereſt in it.</hi> 1. The object that our Souls rejoice in, muſt be ſomething which either is good, or which at leaſt we apprehend to be ſo, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of good lieth in a ſuitableneſs and conveniency of a thing for us, and whatſoever we apprehend ſuited to any of our wants, or convenient for us in any of our circumſtances that we call <hi>good,</hi> and whatſoever we apprehend under that notion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it indeed be ſo or no, we love, and if we want it, we deſire it, if we apprehend it probable to be our portion, we hope for it, if we have it, or apprehend we have it, we delight, and take a complacency, and rejoice in it. 2. So that ſecondly, to make an adequate object of our joy. <hi>There muſt be ſome apprehended union betwixt our Souls, and the object we rejoice in.</hi> For although we can love, and take a ſecret complacency in an object which appeareth to us as good, yet it is <hi>propriety</hi> in it that cauſeth our joy and rejoycings. Thus far now I have only conſidered, and diſcourſed of joy, philoſophically, as it is a natural affection, working upon its proper object.</p>
               <p>Let us now conſider it as a grace, or ſanctified affection. Grace doth not plant new powers in the Soul of man, it only turns the <hi>natural powers</hi> to their proper objects.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour tells us, <hi>there is none good but God,</hi> God is the <hi>Summum Bonum,</hi> the firſt, and chiefeſt good, nor is any thing good, but what deriveth from him. <hi>Chriſt is good,</hi> ſupremely good, as in him there is found, what is ſuited to the greateſt wants and emptineſſes, that the nature of man is expoſed, and ſubject to. And that the <hi>believer</hi> more valueth Chriſt then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man, ariſeth only, 1. <hi>From his different apprehenſion.</hi> 2. <hi>From his different relation to him and intereſt in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. From the <hi>different apprehenſions of good which the believer hath, from thoſe which are in other men.</hi> I told you before, that the nature of good lieth in the ſuitableneſs, or conveniency of a thing to our wants and emptineſſes. Man is a creature made up of two eſſential parts, the <hi>Body</hi> and the <hi>Soul,</hi> that which ſuiteth the one, or the other we call <hi>good.</hi> The Soul is conſiderable, with reſpect to a <hi>preſent,</hi> or <hi>future ſtate,</hi> the firſt is that which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:61084:205"/>
the moſt men are <hi>ſenſible</hi> of, or <hi>concerned</hi> for. We have a threefold perception of an object, according to which we judge of the goodneſs, or badneſs of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt is by the <hi>Eye of ſenſe,</hi> according to which we judge that good which gratifieth the exteriour ſenſes, this of all is the moſt unmanly judgment of it, thus the man of pleaſure judgeth thoſe things good, which gratify his eyes, ears, taſt, ſinell or touch, and indeed this is the judgment of the greateſt part of the world, when they ſay, <hi>who will ſhew us any good?</hi> this is all they underſtand by it, who will gratify our ſenſitive ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites? Theſe are the things they deſire, delight, and rejoice in, theſe men rejoice in nothing, but in pleaſures, profits, or hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, ſuch things as either ſerve the luſt of the Eye, or the luſt of Fleſh, or the pride of life.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſecond Eye by which we diſcern good, and accordingly judge of it is the <hi>Eye of Reaſon,</hi> God hath indued man with a reaſonable Soul, which hath ſeveral powers and faculties, amongſt the reſt, the underſtanding, by which I underſtand that power in man, by which he apprehendeth things, and the reaſon of them, and takes the impreſſion of notions, that which is ſuited to this we call good, and upon a much truer notion then the other.</p>
               <p>Hence is ſome mens thirſt, and deſire of <hi>knowledge,</hi> and <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> is as ſweet to them, as <hi>Wine</hi> is to the Drunkard, they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern an excellency in the mind, and Soul, above what is, or can be in the fleſhly part of a man, and delight more in underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, then the voluptuous man doth in pleaſure, or the world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man in wealth, that is <hi>their good,</hi> for which they contemn pleaſures, and all ſenſual ſatisfactions.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Our third way of apprehending good, is by <hi>the Eye of ſaith,</hi> which the Apoſtle tells us is the <hi>evidence of things not ſeen.</hi> There are ſome whom God hath ſo far enlightned by the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of his will, as they do not only know that they have bodies, and a ſenſitive part, which requireth ſatisfaction to its ſeveral cravings, and a more noble part, which is the <hi>mind,</hi> ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of underſtanding things, and the reaſons, and cauſes of them, but <hi>Souls</hi> (an immortal part) capable of the favour of God, of an union and communion with him, they know that the happineſs of man can lie in nothing beneath the favour of God, nothing beneath an union and communion with him, they have read it in the Word of God to which God hath wrought in their
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:61084:205"/>
hearts a firm and full aſſent, that no man cometh to the <hi>Fathers</hi> but by <hi>Chriſt.</hi> There is no other name given under Heaven, no other way by which they can arrive at a true peace and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, either in this life, or in that which is to come. And from hence it is, that all their deſires are after Chriſt, all their hope in him, and he becometh their chief joy.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſecond reaſon of their rejoicing in Chriſt more then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens, lies <hi>in their different relation to him, and intereſt in him,</hi> or apprehenſions at leaſt of that <hi>relation,</hi> and <hi>intereſt.</hi> I told you before, that although an apprehended good be the object of our <hi>love,</hi> before we enjoy it, the Soul cannot but take ſome pleaſure, and complacency in what he apprehendeth under that notion, yet while the Soul cometh to have ſome relation to it, ſome propriety and intereſt in it, though it may move towards it by deſire, and hope, yet it comes not to a joy, and rejoycing in it, till it comes to have ſome <hi>apprehenſion,</hi> that it hath <hi>obtained it.</hi> You may ſee this in other things; ſuppoſe a man of the world to fancy a great eſtate, or a great degree of honour and di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nity to be good, or that an ingenious Child fancieth the like of <hi>knowledge,</hi> both the one and the other may deſire theſe things at a diſtance; the man of the world may wiſh he had ſuch an Eſtate, and the Schollar may wiſh he had ſuch degrees of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and knowledge; but till the one and the other have attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what they deſire in ſome degree, they cannot rejoice in it, neither is their mind ſatisfied, nor at reſt. It is the ſame caſe as to a <hi>ſpiritual man.</hi> He is enlightned to ſee he hath a Soul of a further capacity, then the moſt men underſtand their Souls to be, that he hath ſome further wants, then the moſt underſtand that they have, he believeth the Scriptures, and underſtands that he wants peace, and reconciliation with God, he underſtandeth that there ſhall be a Reſurrection, a day of Judgment, and that he muſt one day be in an happy, or in a miſerable eternity, ſo as he wants the ſecurity of a better life, when this life ſhall be at an end, upon this account he may be pleaſed with the thoughts of Chriſt; as he by whom theſe good things alone can be obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, he may deſire Chriſt, he may hope in him, but till he comes to apprehend that he hath obtained a part, and intereſt in him, it is impoſſible he ſhould rejoice in him, and according to his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of his intereſt, ſo is his joy, and rejoycing in Chriſt. There muſt be ſome union betwixt the Soul, and its object, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there can be any joy and rejoycing.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="402" facs="tcp:61084:206"/>
1. <hi>There is an union of contemplation.</hi> We cannot ſo much as contemplate a deſirable object, but our Soul muſt have ſome u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with it, and there will a proportionable joy attend this; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this will be of all other the weakeſt in degree, becauſe this is the loweſt degree of union imaginable. Thus a man may rejoyce in the contemplation of a door of ſalvation opened to Mankind by Chriſt, before he hath made any uſe of it at all to enter in thereat. Thus the Angels at the Birth of Chriſt proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>glad tidings, and joy to all people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. There is an <hi>union of hope,</hi> when the Soul doth not only contemplate ſome great and eminent good, but apprehendeth it attainable by itſelf, tho not without ſome difficulty; as this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Soul with its object, now is cloſer, and fuller then the other, ſo the joy that reſulteth from it, muſt neceſſarily be more: hence in Scripture you read of the rejoycing of hope, which the Apoſtle would have believers keep firm.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is an union of <hi>ſenſible poſſeſſion,</hi> or (which is the fame) of <hi>faith, and full perſuaſion,</hi> which makes things unſeen viſible to us, and as this of all other, is the moſt full, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect union, ſo it cauſeth the moſt full, and perfect joy, it moſt ſatisfieth the Soul, and brings it moſt to its reſt, and cauſeth the greateſt triumph, and feſtival in the Soul, even a peace which is paſt all underſtanding.</p>
               <p>There is no believer but hath obtained one of the two latter <hi>unions</hi> with Chriſt: No unbeliever that hath obtained more then the former. An unbeliever may have heard, that Chriſt came into the world to ſave Sinners, to ſeek, and to ſave that which is loſt, and may have a proportionable joy, but alaſs, how little muſt it be, while he neither feeth a need of him, nor yet can have any apprehenſion, that he hath any ſhare or intereſt in him? It can be no more then as the rejoycing of an underſtanding man, to hear that an able Phyſician is come into the Country, before he is ſenſible of any need he hath of him, or hath had any experience of his skill, and ability.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But there is no true believer, but either</hi> hopes in his mercy, or hath ſome aſſurance of his love; <hi>and from hence it is. 1.</hi> That the true believer alone can rejoyce, truly rejoice in Chriſt. <hi>2.</hi> That one believer rejoyceth in him above what another can.</p>
               <p>I ſay, the true believer alone can rejoyce in Chriſt, for <hi>he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is ſenſible of that goodneſs, and excellency that is in him,</hi> and
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:61084:206"/>
he alone is apprehenſive of any relation, that he hath to him, or any intereſt in him; others are without Chriſt, he alone can ſay, <hi>my Lord, and my Saviour.</hi> And hence I ſay it is that one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever can <hi>rejoice in Chriſt more than another,</hi> becauſe one mans apprehenſion of his part and intereſt in Chriſt, may be more full than anothers. One hath but the apprehenſion of a good hope, the other may have a full perſuaſion. But though there may be a great difference in the degrees of believers joy, yet they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur all in their object. <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the <hi>object,</hi> the <hi>ſingular object</hi> of all their joy.</p>
               <p>After this diſcourſe; I need not enlarge in telling you how Chriſt becomes their <hi>object of joy,</hi> not meerly conſidered, as God bleſſed for ever, nor meerly conſidered as <hi>Mediator betwixt God and Man,</hi> and the Saviour of loſt Sinners, if he were not ſo, they could not rejoice in him, but neither doth his being ſo give them any cauſe of rejoycing; but in the notion in which he is mentioned all along this Song. <hi>i. e.</hi> conſidered as their <hi>Bridegroom,</hi> as united unto them, and having a particular favour, and relation to their Souls. For though good conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red abſtractly, may be the object of our <hi>love, deſire,</hi> and <hi>hope,</hi> yet only <hi>good united to us is the object of joy,</hi> yea, and <hi>good appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended</hi> by us as our portion; and according to the degree both of our union with the good, and apprehenſion of that union, ſo will our joy be.</p>
               <p>And hence again, the moſt perfect joy of believers, muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be in their glorified eſtate, hence Heaven is called <hi>Out Maſters joy,</hi> for as our <hi>union</hi> with God and Chriſt will be there moſt full, and perfect, ſo our apprehenſion of it will be moſt clear, and <hi>not interrupted.</hi> But that is not the theme of my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent diſcourſe, I am ſpeaking of the object of believers joy in this life, not in that which ſhall be in that life which is to come, when their joy will be unſpeakable, and full of glory.</p>
               <p>I added in the Propoſition, that Chriſt is the <hi>ſingular object</hi> of their joy. We will (ſaith the Spouſe) be glad, and rejoice <hi>in thee;</hi> this is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And you read of ſome whoſe <hi>rejoycing was to devour the poor, Hab.</hi> 3. 14. I told you before that <hi>Joy</hi> is nothing elſe but the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:61084:207"/>
that the Soul hath, and the reſt which the Soul takes with the <hi>Triumph</hi> which it makes in its union with that Object which it judgeth good. Now the gratifying of <hi>luſts,</hi> and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the ſenſes, and the <hi>concupiſcible,</hi> or <hi>iraſcible appetite,</hi> being that which low-born Souls have choſen as their good; their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing in this ſatisfaction is natural to them. This Joy is but for a moment, <hi>Job</hi> 20. 5. and ſhall one day be turned into heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 9. This mirth, this laughter is madneſs, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 2. 2. like <hi>the crackling of Thorns under a Pot, Eccleſ.</hi> 7. 6. <hi>Sorrow,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon, is better than it,</hi> for thoſe that thus laugh, ſhall weep, <hi>Luk.</hi> 6. 25. The Soul that loves Chriſt cannot rejoyce with this Joy. <hi>Charity rejoyceth not in evil,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. This is inconſiſtent with the enjoyment of Chriſt, and of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, with that <hi>ſelf denial,</hi> which is neceſſary to thoſe that will be his Diſciples, with that <hi>taking up of the Croſs,</hi> which is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Law of his Diſcipleſhip.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is excluſive of <hi>rejoycing in any thing without him.</hi> Though Chriſt, and his <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Favour,</hi> be the believing Soul's ſupreme good, the One thing which he deſireth, yet there are other things which he may and doth account good in their order. God hath not forbidden a man to rejoyce in the Wife of his youth, and in the Children which God hath given him; nor in thoſe providential diſpenſations, by which he accommodateth the lives of his people, and maketh them more ſweet and happy; but the believing Soul cannot rejoyce in theſe things, unleſs at the ſame time he ſeeth reaſon alſo to rejoyce in Chriſt. Men of the world can rejoyce in full Barns, &amp; Coffers, though in the mean time they have no ſenſe, no hope of the pardon of their ſins, and reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation with God; the reaſon is, becauſe they have ſet up theſe things as their chief good, and are not affected with the concerns of their Souls, as they relate to Eternity: But neither can the Believer partake of theſe Joys: The Soul can neither rejoyee in any enjoyment excluſive of its chief good, nor yet in any thing in the abſence of its chief good: A believing Soul in any meaſure ſatisfied concerning the Love of God to it, can rejoyce in the Wife of his boſom, in the Children which God hath given him, in the accommodations with which God hath bleſſed him as to the ſweetning of this life, but without ſome aſſurance, or ſome good hope at leaſt (through grace) that Chriſt is his, and he hath the favour of God in and through his blood; he can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:61084:207"/>
in none of theſe things. It was a peeviſh expreſſion of <hi>Haman, Eſth.</hi> 5. 11, 12, 13. When he told <hi>his friends of the glory of his riches, the multitude of his Children, and all the things wherein the King had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the Princes and Servants of the King;</hi> and how that <hi>Eſther</hi> had invited him, and none but him and <hi>the King to the Banquet which ſhe had prepared;</hi> and added, <hi>All this availeth me nothing ſo long as I ſee</hi> Mordecay <hi>the Jew ſitting in the King's gate. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy ſlayeth the fool</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon.)</hi> But every pious Soul, when he thinks how God hath bleſt him with a loving Wife, ſweet and dutiful Children, a plentiful Eſtate, yet ſaith, <hi>All this availeth me nothing, ſo long as I ſuſpect, and fear, that I have no part or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Chriſt. There be</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) many</hi> who will ſay, <hi>Who will ſhew us any good? Lord, lift thou up the light of thy counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance upon me; thou haſt put gladneſs into my heart, more than in the time that their Corn and Wine increaſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Joy</hi> of <hi>the Soul</hi> in Chriſt is ſuch, that it can rejoyce <hi>in him alone.</hi> It is the expreſſion of the Prophet <hi>Habakkuk, ch.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 17, 18. <hi>Although the Figg-tree ſhall not bloſſom, neither ſhall there be fruit in the Vine, the labour of the Olive ſhall ſail, and the Fields ſhall yield no meat; the Flock ſhall be cut off from the ſold, and there ſhall be no Herd in the ſtalls, yet I will rejoyce in the Lord, and I will joy in the God of my Salvation.</hi> The believing Soul can rejoyce in nothing without Chriſt, and it can rejoyce in Chriſt when it hath nothing more to rejoyce in. Let a gracious Soul have but the ſenſe of God's Love in Chriſt to his Soul, he can ſay to all the world as <hi>Eſau</hi> (though not upon ſuch a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration) ſaid to his Brother <hi>Jacob, I have enough my Brother, I have enough, keep what thou haft unto thy ſelf.</hi> Am I juſtified and regenerated? have I peace with God through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt? have I the pardon of my ſin, and a righteouſneſs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I can ſtand before God? it is enough. If the Lord will not give me Bread to eat, nor Children to continue my name; if I die Childleſs, ſo I do not die Chriſtleſs, it is enough. If I have not Raggs to cloth me, nor an Eſtate to leave Portions to ſix, and alſo to ſeven, yet I have ſaid to the Lord, <hi>Thou art my Portion, it is enough.</hi> Hence ariſeth a good Chriſtian's contentment in all Eſtates. <hi>I have learned</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) in all eſtates to be content, content to want, content to abound,</hi> content to have little or much as the Lord pleaſeth. If the Lord will take away ſuch a man's
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:61084:208"/>
Children, Eſtate, &amp;c. he ſaith with <hi>Job, The Lord hath given, and the Lord hath taken, bleſſed be the Name of the Lord.</hi> If I have my part in Chriſt (ſaith he) I have yet enough. <hi>Omnia mea mecum porto,</hi> I have my All, as the <hi>Philoſopher</hi> is reported to have ſaid, when his City was on fire, and his Neighbours re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected on him going out, and carrying nothing along with him, nor concerning himſelf for the ſhare of Eſtate he had in it. If the Believer conſidereth his body, he ſeeth a crazy conſtitution, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes growing upon him; if he looks into his Family, and ſeeth it empty of Children; if into his Grounds, and ſeeth them bring forth nothing but Weeds, and Thiſtles; if into his Stalls, and ſeeth them empty of Cattel; yet if he looks into his Soul, and finds any evidences of the Love of Chriſt, he can rejoyce in them; this muſt be underſtood, when he ſeeth himſelf ſtript na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, not by his own wicked hands, but (as <hi>Job</hi> was) by the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective <hi>Providence</hi> of God, for the loſs of the things of this life, the good things of the common Providence of God, cauſed by our own ſinful hands, and miſcarriages, oft-times hinder this Joy, as they make it difficult to us to ſee the Love of God in and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And laſtly, This Soul rejoyceth in Chriſt, <hi>Primarily, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatically, Supremely.</hi> The Child of God is a parta ker of fleſh and blood, and hath a ſenſitive appetite, which when gratified, neceſſarily cauſeth a joy proportionate to the good which it receiveth; hence he rejoyceth in the good things of common Providence, as well as another man, but not as much as another man, not upon the ſame account that another man doth. Chriſt is the Believer's <hi>chief Joy;</hi> and as his title to the good things of this life differs from the title of another, ſo his joy in them dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth from the joy of another. All men may have a natural, legal title to the good things of this life; Dominion and Title is not founded in grace, but it is mended by grace. Another man derives from God as the Lord of the whole Earth, who by his common Providence diſtributeth portions to the Sons of men, as he pleaſeth, but the believer doth not only derive from God, as the ſupreme Lord, but <hi>from Chriſt; all is yours, and you are Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) ſo that while he rejoiceth in the gifts of common Providence, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiceth in Chriſt, becauſe he rejoyceth in theſe things as coming from the hand of a Father, reconciled to him by the blood of
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:61084:208"/>
Chriſt; he rejoiceth in the good things of this life, as the loving Wife reioiceth in ſome preſent made her by her Husband, not ſo much in the fineneſs, or coſtlineſs of it (though that may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo pleaſe her humor) as in the kindneſs, and love of her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band ſhewed in giving it her. So the believer more rejoyceth in the goodneſs of God ſhewen to him in any diſpenſation of Providence, then in the thing which God hath given him or her; and he ſupremely rejoiceth in Chriſt, whiles he rejoiceth in a lower comfort. Let me ſhew you this in the inſtance of <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah,</hi> whoſe ſtory you have, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> ch. 1, 2. She was the Wife of <hi>Elkanah,</hi> ſhe had no Children, and was paſſionately deſirous of the bleſſing of Children, an affection common to all (of that ſex eſpecially) and for which there was ſome more ſpecial rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in that Age and Nation, partly becauſe of the promiſe of a numerous iſſue to <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſo as the Women that were Barren, lookt upon themſelves as hardly the genuine Children of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> at leaſt not ſharers in his bleſſing; partly, becauſe they knew the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was to be born of a Jewiſh Woman, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Child-bearing Woman might have an expectation to be his Mother. Under this great affliction ſhe applies her ſelf to God by prayer (the Key of the Womb is one of thoſe Keys which the Jewiſh Doctors ſay God keepeth in his hand) God hears her prayer, ſhe conceiveth, and brings forth <hi>Samuel,</hi> as in the firſt Chapter, ſhe names him <hi>Samuel,</hi> to teſtify her joy in recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him as an anſwer of her Prayer, upon which ſhe dedicates him to the Lord, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 28. So in the ſecond Chapter ſhe ſings a Song of praiſe; mark the phraſe of it, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 1. <hi>Mine heart rejoyceth in the Lord, my Horn is exalted in the Lord.</hi> Her Child was the next object of her joy, but how doth ſhe rejoice in him; the primary object of her joy was the Lord, her great joy in <hi>Samuel</hi> was as God, by giving him to her, ſhewed her his love, and that he had not ſhut out her ſupplications from him. She rejoyced in God, <hi>Supremely,</hi> in <hi>Samuel Subordinately;</hi> in God <hi>Emphatically,</hi> in her Child more remiſsly. Thus doth a good Chriſtian rejoice in Chriſt, thus is he the ſingular object of a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers joy. <hi>David</hi> calleth God the <hi>gladneſs of his joy,</hi> (we tranſlate it <hi>his exceeding</hi> joy) <hi>Pſal.</hi> 43. 4. The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> faith, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 29. 19. <hi>The meek ſhall encreaſe their joy in the Lord, and the poor amongſt men ſhall rejoice in the Holy One of</hi> Iſrael.

                  <hi>brought to nought, and the ſcorner conſumed, and all thoſe that watched for iniquity cut off.</hi> Hence Chriſt commandeth his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples not to rejoice in this, <hi>that the Devils were ſubject to them, but that their names were written in the Book of Life;</hi> Doubtleſs the ſubjection of Devils to them was true matter of joy; ah! but it was no primary object, no ſupreme object of their joy; ; no otherwiſe the object of their joy, then as it was an evidence of Gods favour. It is a great piece of the Spiritual mans art, to rejoice in God, while he rejoiceth in the creature, to make Chriſt the <hi>gladneſs of his joy</hi> (as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> expreſſeth it;) now this motion of a pious Soul will appear to be natural, ſuppoſing him to be firſt enlightned to diſcern, and to be fully perſuaded, that the <hi>love of Chriſt to the Soul</hi> is the greateſt good the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Soul is capable of; this will appear to you, if you will but conſider theſe three or four things.</p>

                  </gap>joyment of ſome good, of which the Soul ſtands in need, and in the purſuit of which it is, is the true and natural cauſe of the motion of that affection which we call joy. <hi>This is evident both to ſenſe and reaſon; we rejoice not in</hi> evil, <hi>but in</hi> good, <hi>not in an</hi> abſent, <hi>but in a</hi> preſent good, <hi>in the ſenſe, and manifeſtation, and apprehenſion of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That the <hi>loves of God</hi> and <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> are the <hi>greateſt goods in the world,</hi> and therefore the preſence, and ſenſible mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtations of them, are the enjoyments and manifeſtations of the ſupreme good. The very light of nature ſhewed the Heathen, that the happineſs of man lay in his <hi>union</hi> with the <hi>greateſt good,</hi> thus far they were agreed by their common reaſon, though they could not ſo well agree what that <hi>chief good</hi> was, &amp; nothing hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred them from agreeing this truth, but their want of true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God and Chriſt, and of the poſſibility of a poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, having an union with him, or any kind of enjoyment of him, or underſtanding the need their Souls ſtood of the loves of Chriſt, for agreeing that the happineſs of man lay in an union with the ſupreme good, they wanted but the revelation we have of mans wants, and the poſſibility of this bleſſed union with, and fruition of God, but they muſt have agreed this truth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>It is but natural to the Soul to rejoice more in the obtaining of a greater good, then in the obtaining of what is leſſer, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice moſt in a good, moſt comprehenſive of other particular goods,</hi>
                  <pb n="409" facs="tcp:61084:209"/>
                  <hi>though it wanteth thoſe particular good things.</hi> Who is there who doth not naturally more rejoice in the getting of five hundred pounds, than of five? becauſe the five hundred pound is a greater good then five; who doth not more rejoice in a great ſtock of mony by him, then in a great quantity of Bread, or a great Wardrobe of Cloaths? the reaſon is, becauſe Mony is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive of theſe, he that hath Mony, can buy Bread and Cloths.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Laſtly, <hi>It is but natural to us to rejoyce in nothing, which we apprehend incompetent with that good wherein our chief happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs doth lie: Nor in the having of any thing which we enjoy, whiles we want that which we look at moſt of all. Rachel</hi> was a good Woman, <hi>Jacob</hi> was her Husband, to whom ſhe was exceeding dear, he had a plentiful eſtate, 'tis hard to ſay what good ſhe wanted, ſave Children only, that bleſſing her heart was upon, <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> was nothing, his eſtate nothing to her; ſhe goes to her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and cries, <hi>Give me Children, or elſe I die.</hi> Now admit a believing Soul to be firmly perſuaded, that it muſt live for ever, either in eternal happineſs, or in eternal miſery, and again to be perſuaded, That it can never live in eternal happineſs, without an union with Chriſt, without his love manifeſted to it in the pardon of its ſins, and the imputation of his righteouſneſs, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Soul to be fired in the purſuit of theſe things as its chief good; how is it poſſible that it ſhould rejoice in any thing incompetent with it, or that it ſhould rejoice in any thing with an equal joy, as it rejoiceth in this? Hence it followeth, that Chriſt muſt be the ſingular object of the believing Souls joy.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1. Becauſe it is</hi> impoſſible the Soul ſhould rejoice in what is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>competent with the ſruition and enjoyment of what it rightly judgeth its chief good. <hi>Such are all ſenſual prohibited ſatisfactions.</hi>

                  <hi>2. Becauſe</hi> it is impoſſible it ſhould rejoice in what it judgeth a leſſer good, more then in what it judgeth a greater, and tranſcendent to it.</p>

               <p>I Am yet handling the Propoſition at firſt laid down. I ſhewed you the laſt day how Chriſt is the ſingular object of the Spouſes joy. I added then; <hi>and the manifeſtations of his love, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in hearing and anſwering our prayers.</hi> Indeed Chriſt is no otherwiſe the object of our <hi>joy,</hi> then in <hi>the manifeſtations of his love.</hi> All joy requireth ſome ſenſible manifeſtation, or experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. The perſonal excellencies of Chriſt, make him the object of our <hi>love,</hi> whom (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>having not ſeen, yet we love</hi> Love asks for nothing but amiableneſs in its object, no more <hi>doth deſire</hi> (which is the firſt born of love) but <hi>joy</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires <hi>propriety</hi> and <hi>union,</hi> Chriſt manifeſted to the Soul, can alone be the object of <hi>joy,</hi> but I added, <hi>eſpecially in hearing, and anſwering Prayer;</hi> that was the caſe here; the Spouſe had prayed, <hi>draw me, and we will run after thee,</hi>—ſhe preſently trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheth in the <hi>hearing of her Prayers,</hi> and then addeth, <hi>we will be glad, and rejoice in thee.</hi> I might have alſo added, <hi>prayers put up par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly for ſpiritual mercies.</hi> We ſhall all along in Scripture find this made a great matter of joy in the hearts of Gods people, take the inſtances of <hi>Hannah</hi> and <hi>David. Hannah</hi> had been, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. praying unto God for a Child, the Lord anſwered, ſee how ſhe rejoiceth, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 1. <hi>Hannah</hi> prayed and ſaid, <hi>My heart rejoiceth in the Lord, mine Horn is exalted in the Lord, my mouth is inlarged over mine Enemies, becauſe I rejoice in thy ſalvation,</hi> Concerning <hi>David</hi> we have many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31. 21. <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord, for he hath ſhewed me his marvellous kindneſs in a ſtrong City.</hi> v. 22. <hi>Thou heardſt the voice of my ſupplication, when I cried unto thee,</hi> Pſal. 3. 4. <hi>I cried unto the Lord with my voice, and he heard me from his holy place;</hi> in this he rejoiceth, and triumpheth, <hi>v.</hi> 6, 8. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 6. 8. <hi>The Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping, the Lord hath heard my</hi>

                  <hi>ſupplication, he will receive my prayer.</hi> So again, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18. 6. &amp; again, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 28. 6. <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord, becauſe he hath heard the voice of my ſupplications,</hi> ſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116. 1. But there needeth no Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the caſe, the experience of every Soul maketh it good; it is natural to every man.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Becauſe in all anſwers of Prayer, there muſt be a ſoul ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction upon ſome union with the object, which it deſired.</hi> Joy is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the triumph of the Soul upon its union with the object which it deſired. Prayer is nothing elſe but the Souls de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire expreſſed with its voice. The anſwer of Prayers muſt be the Souls ſatisfaction in the obtaining of its deſires, this ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction ariſeth from its union with its object, upon which joy is but a proper, and natural reſult, and conſequent.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>In all anſwers of Prayer, there is an owning of the Soul by God.</hi> As the Soul by Prayer owneth God, acknowledging him the Fountain of that goodneſs, which it beggeth; ſo God in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering Prayer acknowledgeth the Soul, <hi>Joh.</hi> 9. 31. <hi>We know that God heareth not ſinners, but if any man be a Worſhipper of God, and doth his will, him he heareth.</hi> All giving in of things prayed for, doth not ſpeak the anſwer of prayers. God may hear and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, the cry of the <hi>miſerable,</hi> when he doth noṫ anſwer the prayer of the righteous. I have before hinted to you, that there is an anſwer of our <hi>cries,</hi> which floweth from Gods common providence, as he is a God of pity, and tender compaſſions, and there is an anſwer of Prayers, which comes from God, as a God of <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>faithfulneſs,</hi> how to diſtinguiſh theſe two, I may poſſibly ſhew you in the application in ſome meaſure, it is the latter anſwer, not the former, which is Gods owning and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of the Soul, as one for whom he hath a favour.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is yet one thing more in the anſwer of prayers, laſt mentioned, which to every thinking Chriſtian is matter of great joy. <hi>That it is that which ſpeaketh the Soul to be beloved of God in Chriſt,</hi> and to have Chriſt for his Advocate, and Interceſſor at the Throne of Grace. It is in him that <hi>all the promiſes</hi> are <hi>Yea,</hi> and <hi>Amen. It is in his name</hi> that the believer asketh, and it is he that doth the thing deſired, according to the promiſe, <hi>John</hi> 14. 13. <hi>Whatſoever you ſhall ask, that I will do, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may be glorified in the Son,</hi> and becauſe the thing is confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, the promiſe is doubled. <hi>v.</hi> 14. <hi>If you ſhall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.</hi> I ſhall add no more to the Doctrinal part of my diſcourſe.</p>

               <p>Secondly, It is a ſign that Soul truly <hi>rejoyceth in the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, that can rejoyce in no ſenſible enjoyment, without the ſenſe of God's love in, and through him.</hi> The unquietneſs and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfaction of the Soul, in the midſt of all its ſenſible comforts, if at any time it wants the ſenſe of God's love, and the pardon, of its ſins, in and through Chriſt, will much evidence Chriſt to be the <hi>Head of his Joy,</hi> or his <hi>chief Joy.</hi> There are few Souls in this life, whoſe daies are without clouds; ſometimes they walk in the light, ſometimes in the dark, and ſee no light; now for a Soul under the fulleſt affluence of created comforts, to be

able to rejoyce in nothing, in the abſence of the ſenſe of Chriſt's love, is an excellent ſign. <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 15. 2. when God bid him ask him what he ſhould give him, replyeth, <hi>Lord, what canſt thou give me ſo long as I go childleſs?</hi> This now argued that a <hi>Child</hi> was the chief of his deſires, and the <hi>chief Joy</hi> which he had in proſpect. <hi>Abraham</hi> had a plentiful Eſtate, a beloved Wife, but his diſſatisfaction, for want of an Heir, ſpake a Child to be his <hi>chief Joy,</hi> an object which his heart was ready more to rejoyce in, than in all that he had beſides it. When the Soul is at this paſs, that it can ſay, Lord, thou haſt given me an Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, or a Wife and Children, and I acknowledge thy goodneſs in them; thou haſt given me a plentiful Eſtate, and I deſire to bleſs thy Name for that; but Lord, what canſt thou give me? what canſt thou do for me? ſo long as I want the ſenſe of thy love in Chriſt, all theſe things are nothing to me, whiles I have this diſſatisfaction; though it will not ſpeak the Soul at this time actually rejoycing in Chriſt, yet it will ſpeak Chriſt to be its <hi>chief Joy.</hi>

O vain man! to make thoſe things his chief buſineſs, ſatisfaction and joy, which will bring the greateſt bitterneſs in the latter end? You compaſs your ſelves about with ſparks, this you ſhall have at the Lords hand, you ſhall one day lie down in ſorrow. For the more civil, and reclaimed ſort of men, whoſe <hi>chief joy</hi> is in the increaſe of their <hi>Corn,</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> and <hi>Oil;</hi> how vain, how tranſitory is this Joy? whilſt thou haſt them, what neceſſities of thy Soul do they ſuit? will they give thee peace when thou art under any diſturbance of mind? will they fit thee for, or advantage thee in any ſpiritual operation? of what advantage can they be to thee as to another life, when as thou comeſt to die? when thou dieſt, leave them all behind thee, and write upon them, <hi>Whoſe ſhall theſe things be?</hi> Nay, mayeſt thou not out-live all the comfort and ſatisfaction which thou haſt in them? Or, may not they in a moment, by a Fire, by a Thief, by an Oppreſſor, be taken out of thy ſight? Are they not Gourds, that come up in a night, and ſerve a little to ſhadow us from the heats, and ſhelter us from the ſtorms that we meet with in this life; and may go down in a night, and leave us as much as any other expoſed to the ſtorms of this world? Are theſe things fit for the chief Joy of a reaſonable Soul, a ſpiritual and immortal being that is under an Ordination to an eternal Exiſtence, and profeſſeth to know, and to believe ſo much? On the other ſide, is the <hi>Believer's Joy,</hi> who rejoyceth in Chriſt, ſo miſplaced?

when thy Soul hath taken no pleaſure nor delight in him here. But you will ſay, what need theſe words? need any Soul be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded to rejoyce in Chriſt, if it were a thing in his own power? and if it be not, to what purpoſe are we ſo perſuaded and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated to it? To this I anſwer:</p>
               <p>It is true, it is not in thy power to <hi>rejoyce in Chriſt.</hi> We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not rejoyce in any thing, be it never ſo good, unleſs we have a <hi>property</hi> and <hi>intereſt</hi> in it, and have <hi>ſome ſenſe and apprehenſion of that intereſt,</hi> ſo that it is no more in our power, to rejoyce in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> than to give our ſelves an intereſt and part in him, and a ſenſe and apprehenſion of that intereſt, both of which are the gift of God. But yet we may do ſomething in the uſe of the common grace of God, given to all of us who ſit under the Goſpel, in order to our having a part and intereſt in him.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>We may read the Scriptures, and hear the Word of God, and mediate upon what we read and hear,</hi> in order to our conviction of that infinite excellency that is in Chriſt, and his ſuitableneſs to the ſtate, and neceſſity of our Souls. We muſt ſee a goodneſs and an excellency in him, before we ſhall love him, deſire him, or delight in him; this goodneſs, this excellency is revealed to us in the Word of God; this we muſt believe, or we ſhall never lie under ſuch a conviction. It is God that muſt give us a power to believe it, but we may read the Word, and hear it opened and applied, in order to this; God (as I have before told you) concurring ordinarily with his ſpecial grace, with our uſe of that common grace which he affords us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>We may ſtudy and meditate upon the vanity of ſenſual joy, or joying meerly in ſenſible things,</hi> and how unfit they are to be the chief Joy of our Souls.</p>

               <p n="1">1.

               <p n="2">2. The ſecond is, <hi>Their too much carnality or worldlineſs.</hi> Where almoſt is the man to be found that cannot rejoyce in his world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Affluences, although he wants the ſenſe of the Love of God in Chriſt? or, that if he were tried, would not find it an hard matter to rejoyce in God, if the Fig-tree did not bloſſom, and there were no fruit on the Vine? How ready are we to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in our creature-comforts when we have them, more than in the Love of Chriſt to our Souls? whence is this but from our too much ſavouring, minding, and living upon Earth, and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Br. 3.</note> Is the hearing of Prayers ſuch a matter of joy to a gracious man? how ſhould this engage us, 1.

Formal Chriſtians who ſend up Prayers to Heaven, and never
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:61084:215"/>
look after them, never conſider whether the Lord anſwereth them yea or no, loſe that pleaſure and ſatisfaction which the Soul hath that watcheth his Prayers; and with <hi>David,</hi> when early in the morning he hath directed his Prayers to God (as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5. 3.) <hi>looketh up.</hi> You read of the Prophet <hi>Habakkuk,</hi> when, <hi>chap.</hi> 1. he had been putting up his Prayer to God, he reſolveth, <hi>chap.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 1. <hi>to ſtand upon his watch, and to ſet himſelf upon the Tower,</hi> watching to ſee what God would <hi>ſay unto him.</hi> Here now comes in a conſiderable queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How a Chriſtian ſhall know whether God hath heard and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered his prayers yea or no?</hi> The difficulty lies upon two things: 1. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon God's different ways of anſwering.</hi> 2. In regard <hi>we may receive the good things we receive from God, meerly from him as a God full of pity, and tender compaſſion, ſeeing, and pitying the miſery and needs of his creatures</hi> (as our Saviour ſaith, He hears the young Ravens when they cry unto him;) Not as from a God in Chriſt reconciled, and hearing us upon the account of his <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Promiſe,</hi> and the Interceſſion of Chriſt. Now the anſwer of thoſe Prayers only, which are anſwered upon the account of Chriſt, and teſtifications of the Love of God in Chriſt can bring the Soul to a <hi>gladneſs</hi> and rejoycing in Chriſt upon that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and motive. As to the firſt,</p>
               <p n="1">1. I ſee no reaſon for a Soul that hath been importunate with God for ſome good thing, which it hath not yet received, if it finds it ſelf ſatisfied under the want of it, and content to ſubmit to the Will of God in the denial of it, and to reſign up it ſelf to his good pleaſure as to the collation of it upon him: I ſay, in ſuch caſes as theſe, I ſee no reaſon for a Chriſtian to queſtion whether this anſwer be from God, as a God of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Faithfulneſs,</hi> fulfilling his <hi>promiſe to the Soul.</hi> His promiſe to his people is to with-hold from them no <hi>good thing,</hi> that is, nothing which ſhall be truly and really good for them, conſidered in their circumſtances: Now where a ſenſible good is with-held, and denied, that a <hi>real good</hi> may be beſtowed, and the Soul is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo brought to ſee its own miſtake in the deſire of that ſenſible good, and to acquieſce in the good pleaſure of God, in not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it; nay, to acknowledge, that it is better for it not to have it, and is quiet, and ſatisfied; certainly this is one of the cleareſt anſwers of our prayers, and no Soul ought to queſtion but this is a return of prayers. Let us put a caſe. Suppoſe a
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:61084:215"/>
Chriſtian lying under the power of ſome mortal diſeaſe, under which he hath often prayed, that if it were poſſible, God would make the bitter Cup of Death to paſs from him: Still he or ſhe groweth weaker and weaker, worſe and worſe, as to his or her bodily ſtate; but they find within themſelves a further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedneſs with the good pleaſure of God, a power to <hi>glory in their tribulation,</hi> and <hi>to rejoyce in the hopes of that glory of God to which its affliction is bringing it;</hi> a deſire, not to be <hi>unclothed</hi> meerly, and <hi>free from its pain,</hi> but <hi>clothed upon,</hi> that mortality might be ſwallowed up in life. What reaſon now hath a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> to ſuſpect whether this be in anſwer to its prayers, and ſlowing from God as a God of Truth fulfilling his Word; ſeeing (as the Apoſtle ſaith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 5.) <hi>He that hath wrought us for the ſelf ſame thing is God, who hath alſo given us the earneſt of the Spirit.</hi> It is a good thing here that is given the Soul; it is given it by God; it is he who hath wrought the heart into this frame. It is given in upon, and after earneſt prayer; and though it be not the very thing in <hi>ſpecie,</hi> which we asked, yet it is in value more, abundantly <hi>compenſating</hi> the things we asked, and finally, the thing which we did ask, we asked with ſubmiſſion to the Will and Wiſdom of God; ſo that as to theſe kinds of anſwers, I take the caſe to be clear.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As to the <hi>giving in of ſuch ſpiritual mercies as we have begg'd of God, in their kind,</hi> whether they be <hi>peace of Conſcience, ſtrength againſt temptations, power againſt corruptions, ſenſible conſolations, more freedom and livelineſs unto, and in duty, there is as little reaſon to doubt, becauſe they are the very good things we a kt.</hi> 2. Of ſuch a ſpiritual nature, as God doth not uſe to give them to Souls that are ſtrangers to him. 3. The matter of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes: The only thing that I can fancy why a Chriſtian ſhould make a doubt here, is, becauſe they may be conſequent to the removal of ſome bodily diſtempers, whoſe influence upon the mind, might cauſe thoſe troubles, that <hi>weakneſs</hi> or <hi>dulneſs,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Melancholy,</hi> &amp;c. But hath God no hand in bringing or remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſuch bodily cauſes? if he hath (as certainly there is no evil in our bodies more than in our Cities, which he hath not done) why may not God both <hi>afflict us</hi> as to our ſpirits, by ſending ſuch diſtempers upon our bodies, and alſo remove the former, which are the effect, by the removal of the latter, which he hath made to be the cauſe. So that admit theſe
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:61084:216"/>
things conſequent to the removal of ſome bodily diſtemper, yet they are the effect of God, and may be, and ought to be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon as the anſwer of our prayers.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The greateſt difficulty of judgment in this caſe is as to thoſe things which are but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the things which concern this life, which God giveth to the righteous as well as the wicked, to the ſinner <hi>crying</hi> unto him, as well as unto his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: How a Chriſtian ſhall diſcern that God when he gives him in theſe mercies, gives them in as <hi>a God of Truth and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs,</hi> remembring his promiſe to his Servants; nor indeed is this Judgment very eaſie to the moſt diſcerning Chriſtian. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing I ſhall ſay in the caſe, whether what will be ſatisfactory or no I cannot tell.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>If they have been given in after prayer made with a Spirit indifferent</hi> (not too importunate I mean for the receiving of them we may hope well. We may obſerve in Scripture, that ſometimes common good things have been wrung out of the hands of God by too much impatience, and importunity, which have never proved bleſſings. Such were the <hi>Quails,</hi> Num. 11. 31, 32, 33. the Text ſaith, <hi>while the fleſh was yet between their teeth, e're it was chewed, the wrath of the Lord was kindled againſt the People.</hi> Such was the <hi>firſt King</hi> given to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> (even <hi>Saul)</hi> the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 13. 11. <hi>I gave thee a King in mine anger.</hi> But when a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> begs of God any good thing, without too much <hi>impatience,</hi> and <hi>importunity,</hi> with an <hi>indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency of Spirit,</hi> reſigning up himſelf to the will of God, as to the receiving of it, and God after ſuch a prayer gives in the mercy, I know not why we ſhould not conclude it an anſwer of prayer. This I think was the caſe of <hi>Hannah,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. She was indeed <hi>grieved,</hi> and <hi>troubled,</hi> becauſe God had denied to her the bleſſing of a Child, in this trouble ſhe prays in a ſolemn manner, we read not of any anger in her Spirit againſt God, any impatience, or ſinful importunity, but ſhe prays as a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of a <hi>troubled Spirit,</hi> the Lord gives her a <hi>Child,</hi> it was but a mercy of a <hi>common nature,</hi> wicked Women have Children as well as others; but it is given in after a <hi>ſolemn prayer,</hi> ſhe looks upon the Child as begged of God. <hi>For this Child</hi> (ſaith ſhe) <hi>I prayed, and the Lord hath given me my Petition which I asked of him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. I ſhall add but one thing more, <hi>viz. When together with the</hi>
                  <pb n="423" facs="tcp:61084:216"/>
                  <hi>good thing, there is an heart given to the perſon to improve, and make uſe of it for the honour, and glory of God. James</hi> lets us know that God never gives us in mercies in anſwer to our prayers, and as evidences of his love and faithfulneſs, that we might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume them upon our luſts, when he tells thoſe to whom he wrote, <hi>James</hi> 4 5. <hi>You ask and receive not, becauſe you ask amiſs, that you may conſume it upon your luſts;</hi> when God giveth us in an outward mercy, if he giveth it us in performance of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and in token of his love, and favour, he together with it gives in an heart inclined, and ready to make uſe of it for the honour, and glory of his name. This is alſo exemplified in the caſe of <hi>Hannah,</hi> in the text before-mentioned, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 27, 28. <hi>For this Child, ſaith ſhe, I prayed, the Lord hath given me my Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition which I asked of him, therefore alſo I have lent him to the Lord, as long as he liveth, he ſhall be lent unto the Lord.</hi> In the margent of your larger Bibles, you will ſee it may be read; <hi>He whom I have obtained by Petition, ſhall be returned to the Lord.</hi> You have another no leſs famous inſtance of it in <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 116. v. 1. <hi>I love the Lord, becauſe he hath heard my voice, and ſupplications. The Lord hath heard his voice.</hi> v. 1. <hi>He had inclined his ear unto him.</hi> v. 2. <hi>The Lord had dealt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> graciouſly with him.</hi> v. 7. <hi>He had delivered his Soul from death, his Eyes from tears, and his feet from falling.</hi> Now mark the product of this. <hi>He lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Lord, becauſe of it.</hi> v. 2. <hi>He reſolveth to call upon the Lord ſo long as he lived.</hi> v. 9. <hi>To walk before the Lord in the land of the living.</hi> v. 13. <hi>To take the cup of ſalvation, and to call upon the name of the Lord.</hi> v. 14. <hi>To pay his vows.</hi> v. 16. <hi>To be the Lords Servant.</hi> v. 17. <hi>To offer the Sacrifice of Thanksgiving,</hi> &amp;c. Now where upon prayer for a more common mercy, ſuppoſe <hi>life, health, riches, ſucceſs in buſineſs,</hi> we find that the Lord hath given us both the thing which we asked of God, and an heart to honour God with it, and to make a due improvement of it, we have there no reaſon to doubt, but that it is given us in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to our prayers, and in teſtification of his faithfulneſs and love towards us. This now is of great concern to us, in order to our gladneſs, and joy in him upon the receiving an anſwer of our prayers; for how ſhall we rejoice in him, upon any ſuch occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, unleſs we diſcern our good things coming from him. This I think is enough to have ſpoken to this queſtion, and upon this whole argument. I ſhall now proceed (as God gives me oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity)
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:61084:217"/>

               <p>YOU heard in my laſt diſcourſe the firſt <hi>effect,</hi> that the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loveds</hi> favour, ſhewed to his Spouſe, in the <hi>quick return he made to her prayers,</hi> and the <hi>royal favour</hi> he had beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her, in bringing her into his <hi>Chambers,</hi> admitting her to ſome more ſpecial, and intimate degrees of communion with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, had upon her; it put gladneſs into her heart, and brought her up to an <hi>exulting</hi> and rejoycing in him. <hi>Joy</hi> is but a <hi>paſſion, cito fit, cito perit,</hi> that doth not laſt alwaies, it is like a Land-flood, that is ſometimes up, but will in a ſhort time abate. Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Joys do ſo. But the Spouſe reſolves to keep up here, and to this end ſhe ſaith, <hi>She will remember the Loves of Chriſt,</hi> and give them a memorial ſuited to their excellency. <hi>We will</hi> (ſaith ſhe) <hi>remember them more than Wine,</hi> or (which is the ſame in the <hi>Hebrew dialect) Before Wine.</hi> I ſhall immediately cloſe with the Propoſition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> The Soul that hath once received the grace of Chriſt, will remember his Loves more than Wine.</p>
               <p>In the handling of it, I ſhall keep to my uſual method of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, Confirmation,</hi> and <hi>Application.</hi> In the Explication I ſhall inquire what is here meant by <hi>Chriſt's Loves;</hi> 2. <hi>What is meant by Wine;</hi> 3. What by <hi>Remembring the Loves of Chriſt more than Wine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We met with the ſame word, <hi>v.</hi> 2. the <hi>Septuagint</hi> tranſlate it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and according to them the <hi>Vulgar</hi> Latine, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bera tua,</hi> thy <hi>Breaſts;</hi> that which cauſeth the different reading is the cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of that word which ſignifieth Love, with that which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth a <hi>Breaſt</hi> (the difference is only in the points) the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:61084:217"/>
is not hard to compound; for thoſe that will have it tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Breaſts,</hi> agree in the ſenſe, <hi>thy Loves;</hi> all the difference is, we contend, the word in its original ſignification primarily ſo ſignifieth; they ſay it ſo ſignifieth only in a figure. By Chriſt's <hi>Loves,</hi> ſhe doubtleſs meaneth the <hi>manifeſtation of his Love,</hi> which ſhe calleth <hi>Loves,</hi> becauſe of the variety of them: But of theſe I have had occaſion heretofore once and again to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. The term <hi>Wine</hi> I have alſo before opened. We all know that in its primary &amp; literal ſignification, it ſignifieth the <hi>Juice of the Grape;</hi> certainly this is much too low a ſignification for this place: It hath beſides this a figurative ſenſe in Scripture, and ſo it is either taken <hi>Synecdochically.</hi> Thus <hi>Bread and Wine</hi> in Scripture doth often ſignifie all things neceſſary for our food and ſubſiſtence; or <hi>Metaphorically,</hi> for whatſoever is ſweet and <hi>delicate;</hi> and this I take to be the genuine ſenſe of the words. <hi>We will remember thy Loves more than all wordly enjoyments, how neceſſary or pleaſant ſoever.</hi> I am aware of ſome other ſenſes, which ſome Interpreters put upon this phraſe, but I take them to be forced and ſtrained. This ſeems without more adoe to be the plain and unconſtrained ſenſe of the words. But having before opened theſe two terms, that which I have principally to attend, is the opening of that term <hi>Remember.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Remembring</hi> properly ſignifieth a <hi>reflex act of our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,</hi> by which the former impreſſions which we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived either of notions, or things, is revived, and brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to our minds and thoughts, whatſoever we receive either by our exterior ſenſes, or by our common ſenſe or any other way, maketh an impreſſion upon us; now this impreſſion, through the coming in of a variety of other objects, is apt to wear out, and die in our Souls, when the thoughts, or notion of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vives, and is repeated upon our Souls, then are we ſaid to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member</hi> the things. In this ſenſe it is a meer natural Act.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is an uſual obſervation of Divines, that <hi>words of ſenſe uſed in holy Writ, do not ſignifie the bare acts of thoſe ſenſes which are expreſſed by them,</hi> but thoſe <hi>affections which are excited by ſuch acts in our Souls, and thoſe effects which thoſe acts do ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily produce in our actions and converſation.</hi> And ſo this term <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member</hi> is often uſed in holy Writ. When <hi>Solomon</hi> calls to the young man to <hi>Remember his Creator in the daies of his youth,</hi> he intendeth not only the <hi>act of his memory and underſtanding,</hi> that
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:61084:218"/>
he ſhould call to mind that he had a Creator, and what a one he was, but that he ſhould <hi>rėmember to love him,</hi> and to <hi>fear,</hi> and <hi>obey him;</hi> to pay him the homage that was due to him, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12. 1. When the people of God in Scripture prayed. that the Lord would <hi>remember his tender mercies, Pſal.</hi> 25. 6. And <hi>David</hi> prays, that the Lord <hi>would remember him, and all his afflictions, Pſal.</hi> 132. 1. and that <hi>the Lord would remember his Word unto his Servant:</hi> He prays that the Lord would ſhew him the goodneſs that he had promiſed, and ſuit his diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of providence to his afflicted ſtate in proportionable ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours. So when God's People promiſe to <hi>remember</hi> him, the promiſe is not of a bare act of the <hi>memory</hi> and <hi>underſtanding,</hi> but of the ſeveral <hi>powers</hi> and <hi>faculties of the Soul,</hi> uſually ſet on work by ſuch a notion and remembrance of things of that nature, ſo as the remembrance of the Loves of Chriſt ſignifieth ſeveral things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The keeping the expreſſions and manifeſtations of his Love up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our thoughts, or retrieving the thoughts of it, if they have ſlipt us, or the impreſſions of it have been in any meaſure worn out.</hi> Thus <hi>remembring,</hi> is oppoſed to <hi>forgetting.</hi> To the practice of any du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty incumbent upon us, is not only required our notion or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the thing as our duty, but the preſence of it in our thoughts at the time when it is to be done by us; for, let us know it never ſo well, if we do not think of it, in the ſeaſon when it is to be performed, we ſhall not do it. Now, ſaith the Spouſe, <hi>We will remember thy Loves,</hi> that is, we will keep a freſh ſcent and impreſſion of them; the ſavour of what thou haſt done for my Soul, ſhall not go off my Soul. This is the duty of every good man and woman; it is in it ſelf an homage to God; God hath given us a <hi>power</hi> of <hi>remembring,</hi> and thus we give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God the homage of that power of our Souls. Our <hi>memory</hi> is as the cheſt of our Souls, which God hath given us not only to lock up worldly things or notions in, but to lock up in them ſpiritual notions and impreſſions. Two waies we ſerve God with our memories, 1. <hi>When we uſe them to retain ſpiritual notions,</hi> to keep up the <hi>Knowledge of God,</hi> and the things of God in us, 2. <hi>When we uſe them as repoſitories for the works of God,</hi> for the retaining in our minds what God hath done for us. 2. As it is in it ſelf an homage to God, the homage of that power in us which we call the <hi>memory; ſo it is the Mother of all our other homage:</hi>
                  <pb n="427" facs="tcp:61084:218"/>
we muſt <hi>remember</hi> a thing paſt, before we can be <hi>afreſh affected with it;</hi> before in the ſenſe of it we can do any thing, which ſuch a diſpenſation calleth to us for.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>It implies a meditation and pondering upon the Loves of Chriſt. David</hi> promiſeth unto God not only a meditation of his <hi>Law,</hi> and <hi>Word,</hi> his <hi>Statutes</hi> and <hi>Precepts, Pſal.</hi> 119. 148. 15 but alſo of his <hi>Works, Pſal.</hi> 77. 12. 143. 5. The Works of God are either more <hi>publick</hi> and<hi>general,</hi> or more <hi>private</hi> and <hi>perſonal.</hi> There are Works of God without us, ſuch are his Works of <hi>Creation</hi> and <hi>Providence;</hi> works of Go d upon us and within us, ſuch are all his works of ſpecial grace: They are either ſuch as are <hi>ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ding</hi> (in their <hi>effects</hi> at leaſt) or tranſient; the latter are the objects properly of our memories; the other are the objects of our contemplation and admiration. Now, as we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>remember</hi> any thing but we muſt think upon it; ſo the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of any object maketh way for further meditation upon it; the Spouſe promiſing to remember Chriſt's Loves, promiſeth not only the revival of them in her thoughts, but the ſeeding of her thoughts with them, the fixing of her heart up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>It implieth ſuitable affections;</hi> the exciting of ſuch <hi>inward affections in the Soul, as the remembrance of ſo ſweet and obliging objects are proper to excite.</hi> Such as love to God, further thirſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and breathings after God, a ſuitable hope and confidence in God. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief</hi> in Scripture is called a not <hi>remembring,</hi> becauſe <hi>forgetfulneſs</hi> is one cauſe of <hi>unbelief,</hi> Pſal. 78. 42. <hi>v.</hi> 41. <hi>They tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned back, and tempted God, and limited the holy one of</hi> Iſrael, there was their <hi>unbelief.</hi> v. 42. <hi>they remembred not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the Enemy.</hi> So <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 9, 10. Chriſt calls his Diſciples <hi>men of little faith, for reaſoning with themſelves,</hi> becauſe they had <hi>brought no bread</hi> in a <hi>diſtruſt</hi> of his power, and <hi>goodneſs</hi> in providing for them, <hi>v.</hi> 9. 10. <hi>Do you not underſtand, nor remember the five loaves of the five thouſand, and how many Baskets full you took up.</hi> Our Saviour there chargeth their unbelief upon their <hi>not remembring</hi> the former works of God. No man doth rightly remember the <hi>loves of Chriſt,</hi> but he who is ſuitably affected with them, and whoſe Soul moves toward God, as one that remembreth his love.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Laſtly, <hi>Remembring implyeth a ſuitable practice.</hi> Thus it is often uſed in Holy Writ. <hi>Remember thy Creator in the days of thy</hi>
                  <pb n="428" facs="tcp:61084:219"/>
                  <hi>Youth,</hi> is the ſame with Serve, and Obey thy Creator, and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to keep holy the Sabbath-day,</hi> is the ſame with be diligent and make it thy buſineſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> to ſanctify the Sabbath-day. So then the ſenſe of the Propoſition is plainly this.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Souls which have once taſted how good the Lord is, and have had any experiences of his ſpecial ſaving grace, will, and ought to be careful to preſerve the ſavour of it upon their hearts, to think, and med<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tate upon them, to be ſuitably affected toward God, according to the nature, and degrees of them, and accordingly to manage their converſations, that men may ſee that they value them above all the <hi>pleaſures</hi> and <hi>profits of this world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus did</hi> Aſaph, <hi>Pſal. 77.</hi> v. <hi>10.</hi> I will remember the years of the right hand of the moſt high, I will remember the works of the Lord, ſurely I will remember thy wonders of old, I will meditate al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of thy works, and talk of all thy wondrous doings. <hi>theſe were the ancient works of God in kindneſs to his people, as you will find,</hi> v. <hi>14. 15, 16.</hi> My mouth <hi>(ſaith</hi> David) Pſal. <hi>63. 6.</hi> ſhall praiſe thee with joyful lips, when I remember thee upon my Bed, and meditate on thee in the night watches, becauſe thou haſt been my help. <hi>So</hi> Pſal. <hi>143. 5.</hi> I remember the days of old, I meditate on all thy works, I muſe on the work of thy hands. <hi>You will find the people of God in Holy Writ, much in theſe</hi> reſolutions <hi>to remember the works of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. There is great reaſon for our remembrance of the loves of Chriſt more then <hi>Wine.</hi> 1. <hi>Becauſe they really are much better than Wine.</hi> Every mans Soul doth naturally deſire good, good and evil are the two things which make impreſſions upon the mind of man, evil leaves an impreſſion of <hi>fear,</hi> and <hi>ſorrow,</hi> and <hi>anger.</hi> Good makes an impreſſion of <hi>love, joy, delight,</hi> and as are the degrees of the one and the other, ſo are the impreſſions made by them. Great evils make deep furrows in our Souls, and leave great impreſſions upon our minds, minute evils leave leſſer impreſſions; ſo things that are good in the higheſt degree<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> leave impreſſions of <hi>joy,</hi> and <hi>delight,</hi> ſuitable to the nature of that good which is in them. The manifeſtations of the love of Chriſt to the Soul are the greateſt goods, and therefore ſhould make the greateſt impreſſions upon us. They are goods, not ſuited to the Souls irregular paſſions, but to its greateſt wants. <hi>Health, peace, ſucceſs in buſineſs,</hi> are things we call good, but
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:61084:219"/>
their goodneſs lieth only in a ſuitableneſs they have to the wants of our outward man, what are any of theſe things to the Soul? the <hi>loves</hi> of Chriſt are ſuited to the wants of the Soul, and that not only conſidered as a reaſonable being (ſo knowledge, and learning are alſo ſuited to the Souls wants, and all improvements of reaſon, or means in order to it) but to the wants of the Soul conſidered as an immortal being capable of an eternal happineſs. Nothing more becomes a reaſonable Soul, then to put a due rate and value upon things and to prefer what is truly preferrible.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This is one great reaſon of the Lords works, <hi>That he might be remembred for, and by them.</hi> God indeed in his gracious influences aims at the ſupply of the Soul, as to what it needeth, but he hath an higher end then this, <hi>viz. his own glory,</hi> the glory of his goodneſs, truth, and faithfulneſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 111. 4. <hi>He hath made his wonderful works to be remembred.</hi> It is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement we ſometime<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Yet is not this the courſe of the moſt Men and Women, who never think of their <hi>dying Saviour,</hi> to reſtrain them in their drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, debaucheries, in their greateſt exceſſes of Riot? Nay, how many are there that ſeldom take the love of Chriſt into their thoughts, the love of their cups, and of their Harlots, hath made Chriſts loves to be utterly forgotten by their Souls; for how can they ſay that they remember <hi>Chriſts loves</hi> above their luſts, that will not quench one luſt for his ſake, they in whom the remembrance of <hi>Chriſts death</hi> will not extinguiſh one vile affection, one ſpark of pleaſing luſt, will not the moſt of men, and women, yea, ſuch, in whoſe ears the loves of Chriſt are publiſhed every Lords day, be found periſhing for preferring the very <hi>lees, and dregs of Wine,</hi> before the loves of Chriſt? I mean for preferring the baſeſt, and moſt ſordid kind of pleaſures, and ſatisfactions of the fleſh (for ſuch are thoſe pleaſures which are no more than the gratifying of the ſenſitive appetite.)</p>

I mean not for the proportion of time ſpent in the one and the other; God hath indulged our infirmity in that, he hath ſet apart a ſeventh day only to himſelf; but examine this, whether you <hi>remember the loves of Chriſt on the Lords day, as you remember your worldly concerns on any of the other ſix days;</hi> do the loves of Chriſt come into your thoughts, as much on the week day, as the world comes into your thoughts on the Lords days? I ſear there is none of us all can ſay, that in this thing our hearts are clean; I hope I ſpeak to many who remember the loves of Chriſt, and will never ſuffer his dying love to go off their thoughts. But when we come to theſe comparative examinations, to enquire whether we remember his loves, more then we remember our ſenſual, or ſenſible objects; ah, how ſhort do we come of the duty of Chriſtians, yea, of what our ſelves will own, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs to be our duty? <hi>Happy is that man that doth not condemn himſelf, even in the thing which he alloweth to be his duty.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Uſe. 2.</note> But I had rather ſpend my time in perſuading my ſelf, and you to our duty, which according to my explication of the text and this propoſitionwill lye much in two things 1. <hi>In a full and perfect remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the Loves of Chriſt.</hi> 2. <hi>In a remembrance of them proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to that degree of goodneſs and excellency in them.</hi> I ſay, firſt in a Scriptual remembrance a full and perfect remembrance of the Loves of Chriſt. I am afraid that we ſatisfy our ſelves too much in a <hi>Notio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> formal <hi>remembrance of Chriſts Loves</hi> and ſo pleaſe our ſelves, in hearing the Goſpel read, opened, and applyed to our Souls, in a formal keeping of the <hi>Lords day</hi> (the day which God hath ſet apart for us to call to our minds all the acts of our redemption compleated in his reſurrection) ſome Churches aware of Peoples awkneſs to this Spiritual duty, have thought fit to appoint other days for a more ſolemn remembrance of his <hi>incarnation,</hi> and <hi>death.</hi> Nor have I any thing to ſay againſt any Chriſtians that will ſet apart any Special times to remember any Loves of Chriſt (though I do not know that Chriſt hath left any power to his Church to impoſe particular
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:61084:221"/>
times of this nature.) But alas! this is the leaſt part of our duty in <hi>the remembrance of his Love.</hi> We may have a day to remember it in (we have ſuch a day every week<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) we may have helps to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it by. The holy Scriptures, the Miniſters of the Goſpel that Preach Chriſt to their People are ſuch helps. But if in theſe days, if with theſe helps, we do not ſet our ſelves to meditate of the <hi>Loves of Chriſt,</hi> to turn our thoughts from other things, to the contemplation of, and meditation upon the Love of a <hi>Chriſt incarnate,</hi> the Love of a Chriſt dying, and riſeing again from the dead, if we do not ſtudy to get our hearts affected ſuitably to ſuch Love, with love, faith, hope, &amp;c. we do not ſo live as a People that remember Chriſt died for our Sins, declining whatſoever is contrary to his will, and Law in the Goſpel, do what in us lyeth to promove his honour &amp; Glory, we are ſo far from Satisfying our Duty by this formal remembrance of his Love, that we are the greateſt <hi>forgetters of his Love.</hi> The Jews who never owned him as their Redeemer, the Heathen who never heard of his name, nor of what he was or did for Sinners can in no propriety of Speech be ſaid to <hi>forget his Loves.</hi> The Chriſtian only, the <hi>looſe Chriſtian,</hi> the <hi>formal</hi> Chriſtian, he who hears every day of the dying Love of Chriſt, yet goes on to defy him, to crucify him afreſh, and to put him to open ſhame, or he who every Lords day hears the ſound of the <hi>Loves</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and reads of it, yet never meditates upon it, never ſuffers his ſoul by contemplation to pierce into the heights, or ſound the depths of it, whoſe heart is never truly affected with it ſo as he hath any Love kindled in his ſoul towards Chriſt, no breathings after him, who exerciſeth no faith, no hope in him; he that lives not in his meaſure up to it, leaving his vain converſation, worſhiping God in the Spirit, rejoycing in him, living up in a cloſe obedience to his Law; this is the man that forgetteth the Loves of Chriſt. But yet if there be a Soul that hath experienced the Loves of Chriſt in a particular application to it ſelf, that hath given it ſelf a liberty to the fleſh, and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a contrary courſe to what the Law of Chriſt requireth, this Soul yet more forgets his Loves, becauſe he had a deeper impreſſion of them upon his heart; the Love of Chriſt made an impreſſion only upon the others Ears, but it hath entred into this man's Soul. He is the greateſt forgetter of his Love. You ſhall obſerve in holy Writ, that all ſin is expreſt under the notion of <hi>forgetting God, Pſal.</hi> 50. 22. and in a multitude of other Texts, and this not only becauſe a <hi>forgetting of God</hi> is the cauſe of all
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:61084:221"/>
the Violations of his Law, which we could not violate, if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred God as we ought to do; but becauſe indeed all ſin <hi>in God's account is an actual' forgetting of him,</hi> God accounts us to know, to remember no more than we are affected with, and live up unto. Therefore Chriſtians, let us make it our buſineſs not only to call to mind the Loves of Chriſt, but to remember them in that ſenſe which God calleth a remembrance of them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let us not ſatisfie our ſelves with a bare <hi>remembrance of his Loves,</hi> but labour to <hi>remember them more than Wine;</hi> more than the moſt ſweet and pleaſant, the moſt gainful and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table things which this world affords. Think that you hear Chriſt ſpeaking in your Ears, in the language in which he once ſpake to <hi>Peter,</hi> ſetting all the pleaſant and gainful things in the world before you, and then ſaying to you, Chriſtians! <hi>Love you me more than theſe?</hi> Let me ſhew you the reaſonableneſs of this.</p>
               <p n="1">1.

                  <hi>I have loved thee more than all theſe.</hi> They are yet wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing in their native blood, as thou wert before I paſſed by thee in <hi>my time of love, and ſaid unto thee live;</hi> they are yet Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of wrath, in an hourly danger of having it come upon them to the utmoſt; I have plucked thee out of <hi>Sodom:</hi> Thy heart by nature was as hard as theirs, as much prejudiced againſt thy own ſalvation; I have made thee to differ. <hi>I have loved thee more than all theſe.</hi> May I riſe one ſtep higher to commend the Love of Chriſt to thy <hi>remembrance,</hi> thou mayeſt fancy all that <hi>glory</hi> which Chriſt had with his Father from before the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the world; all the bleſſed company of Heaven; all the riches of Chriſt's glory and felicity, before his and thy Eye, and fancy that thou heareſt Chriſt ſay to thee, <hi>My poor creature,</hi> I have in a <hi>ſenſe,</hi> and <hi>for a time loved thee more than theſe:</hi> I left my Father's Throne, and right Hand, him whom I was alwaies before, brought up with him, I left all to come down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Earth, to take thy fleſh, to be born of a Virgin, and to be laid in a Manger, to live a poor and contemned life in the world, to die a ſhameful and ignominious death, and all this to purchaſe for thee Eternal Life and Salvation, and to redeem thee from thy vain converſation. <hi>Have I not loved thee more than theſe?</hi> What doth the Apoſtle ſay leſs than this, when he ſaith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 9. <hi>You know the grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that though he was rich, yet for your ſake he became poor, that you through his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty might be made rich.</hi> In what degree then canſt thou be ſaid to anſwer the Loves of Chriſt, if when there is ſet before thee no more than <hi>the pleaſures of ſin which are but for a ſeaſon,</hi> the <hi>profits</hi> and <hi>enjoyments</hi> of this life, which thou canſt have no more than a Leaſe for Life of; if thou canſt not ſay, Yea Lord, thou that knoweſt all things, knoweſt that <hi>I remember thy Love more than theſe.</hi> Either this intoxicating Wine of ſinful luſts and pleaſures, how gratifying ſoever they be to my fleſhly appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite: or this pleaſant and gainful Wine of worldly Riches, Eſtate, Honour, Preferment, &amp;c.

               <p n="2">2. The ſecond Conſideration is yet more dreadful, <hi>viz.

                  </gap>. It is certainly as true, That man or woman that remembers any ſenſible Enjoyment, and is more affected with it, than the Loves of Chriſt, is not worthy of his Loves. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly nothing more becometh us who pretend to be creatures endued with reaſon, than to value things according to their meaſure, and their true and juſt valuation. You will ſay he is not worthy of a Jewel of great price, that valueth a Pebble be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it. And by the way, this will be enough to convince us all, that <hi>we are ſaved by Grace,</hi> and have what Love we have from Chriſt freely. For who is not guilty of a great Errour in this particular. We think of ſenſible things more than of the Loves of Chriſt; they are more the objects of our meditations, the ſubjects of our diſcourſes, and the marks of our actions. It is well for us that our Salvation doth not depend upon the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of our gracious acts, and that we have another Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, than that of our own to appear in before God. That when our Conſciences check us in this particular, and tell us that we do not remember Chriſt's Loves more than Wine; yet the Goſpel relieveth us, by telling us that he was made of God <hi>for us</hi> Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and we can remember that this Chriſt (whoſe Loves we ſhould remember after a better manner than we do) is the <hi>Lord our Righteouſneſs,</hi> an <hi>High Prieſt</hi> that can have compaſſion on our infirmities, he in whom we are compleat. But yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will this relieve us, unleſs we <hi>humble</hi> our ſelves before God for our failures in this particular. Fly to him for pardon, and endeavour even in this thing to perfect holineſs; and that bringeth me to the laſt thing I have to do, <hi>viz.</hi> To offer you my Advice in order to the bringing up of your hearts to this juſt valuation and remembrance of theſe Loves of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Labour to <hi>underſtand them.</hi> We can meditate upon nothing, but what we have ſome notion of, we can remember nothing but what we have had ſome notion of. There are the <hi>loves of God,</hi> and <hi>the loves of Chriſt,</hi> indeed the loves of Chriſt, are the loves of him who thought it no robbery to be equal with the Father, who is God over all, bleſſed for ever; but by the loves
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:61084:223"/>
of Chriſt, I mean the kindneſs which floweth to us, from Chriſt as <hi>God-man,</hi> united in one Perſon as our Mediator. There is a love and kindneſs which floweth to us from the providence of God, working either more generally, and extending to all, or more <hi>ſpecially</hi> towards ſome. There is alſo a love and kindneſs, which floweth from Chriſt as our <hi>Redeemer, Mediator, Saviour.</hi> Both theſe loves are to be remembred, but the latter more eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially are called the loves of Chriſt; underſtand the <hi>loves of God</hi> in the effluxes of his good providence. More eſpecially <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand</hi> the loves of Chriſt as the Saviour of Man: there are alſo ſome of theſe more <hi>common</hi> to others, ſome more <hi>ſpecial to ſome.</hi> Of the firſt ſort are the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and the <hi>publication of it to us;</hi> of the latter ſort are thoſe <hi>effects of grace</hi> which are wrought in us, in the <hi>juſtification of our Souls,</hi> the <hi>change of our hearts,</hi> the renovation of our natures, the ſtrengthenings, quicknings, and conſolations of the Spirit of Chriſt. Labour to underſtand all your good things, as coming from the hand of God, and to underſtand the kindneſs of God in them, ſee your good things as mercies, as Divine gifts, and then ſtudy them;</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the <hi>ſuitableneſs of them to your States.</hi> In this lies the nature of all good; from this muſt be judged the degrees and meaſures of good that are in every grateful thing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the <hi>freeneſs of them;</hi> Freeneſs is indeed of the nature of grace; take away <hi>freeneſs,</hi> and you take away the nature of grace, which muſt flow freely without any merit in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or it is no more grace but debt; no more love but ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. If you underſtand not Chriſt's Loves, it is impoſſible you ſhould duly remember them.</p>

                  <hi>and Wine, and Oil, and multiplies our Silver and Gold.</hi> We muſt look for higher things then theſe, or elſe it is impoſſible we ſhould remember them more then theſe. The beſt manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of love muſt be diſcerned in the giving us thoſe things which more ſuit our ſtate, and are ſuitable to greater wants. Neither ſhall we effectually remember theſe, till we find we have a <hi>propriety</hi> in them. You will upon experience in all things find, that it is <hi>propriety</hi> which gives us the <hi>ſweetneſs</hi> in any good thing. Suppoſs a brave and noble Houſe or Eſtate, we may look
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:61084:223" rendition="simple:additions"/>
upon it, and admire it, and it may pleaſe us, but it is propriety in ſuch an eſtate that muſt make it ſweet, and pleaſant to us. We may have a kind of love for a Prince, of whom we hear, that he is <hi>juſt and merciful,</hi> and endowed with many other qualities acceptable to humane nature, but we ſhall not much delight in him, nor remember his love, until our ſelves have in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure taſted, and experienced it, an intereſt, and property in the love of another, that is it which gives it an impreſſion upon our Souls; God hath commended his love to the world, in ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Chriſt to die for ſinners, Chriſt hath commended his love to them, in coming into the world, and dying for them, not for all, but for thoſe that ſhall believe in him; men may talk of this love of Chriſt, and uſe their <hi>Rhetorick</hi> a little about it, in the magnifying of it, but till their own Souls come to be <hi>waſhed with this blood,</hi> till they come to have their iniquities forgiven, and their ſins covered, it is not to be expected that his love ſhould affect them much, or ſink any thing deep into their Souls, ſo as to be revived by any effectual remembrance.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Would you remember the loves of Chriſt as you ought to do, <hi>more then Wine,</hi> Set then your ſelves, ſometimes for <hi>ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liloquy, and meditation.</hi> When the Sound of the Gofpel paſſeth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our ears, we receive a little of it, but tranſient things affect not much, nor leave any great impreſſions upon us. <hi>Meditation</hi> upon a Subject is the Souls ſtanding, and dwelling upon it, it is like the digeſtion of our food, there is nothing can be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, a more rational means to affect the Soul with any thing; or to make it fit for the memory to reflect upon, then <hi>meditation.</hi> One great reaſon why we remember the loves of Chriſt no better, nor more, is becauſe we are not at leiſure; our heads are ſo unreaſonably full of wordly cares, and employments, the cares of the world ſo choke, and fill up our thoughts, that we have no leiſure to meditate, or ſtand upon the thoughts of Chriſts loves, or any ſpiritual objects. Would Chriſtians allow themſelves more time to fix their thoughts upon ſpiritual ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, to pierce into the depths of divine love, to conſider what Chriſt hath done for them in particular, they would better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Take heed of any wilful ſinnings againſt his love.</hi> Sinning (as I told you before) is uſually ſet out in Scripture, under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a <hi>forgetting God,</hi> and forgetting his loves, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 11.

                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106. 13, 21. the committing of ſin frequently, is like the continual dropping of water upon a thing, which waſheth, and weareth out impreſſions upon it. Beſides it is natural to us, not to deſire, or to be willing to remember the kindneſs of a friend, whoſe kindneſs we have abuſed. Sin puts the taſt of Chriſts love out of the Soul. A remembrance of Chriſts love, ſo as to be in any meaſure duly affected with it, is incompetent with wilful and preſumptuous ſinning. None but the holy, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Soul remembreth the loves of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Laſtly, <hi>Wait upon God in ordinances, in hearing the Word, in the Holy Sacrament of his Supper.</hi> The ordinances of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel are not only <hi>means of grace,</hi> but <hi>great helps to Chriſtians</hi> me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, as to Chriſts loves; we preach a <hi>Chriſt crucified,</hi> there his loves come to our ears, in the Supper you have a repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Chriſt crucified, there his loves, his dying love is ſet before your <hi>Eyes,</hi> both are helps to the mind of that man or woman, who deſireth to feed his thoughts upon the loves of Chriſt.

to guide us) The import of it ſeems to be to expreſs to us the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Saints love to God, which is not in <hi>word,</hi> or <hi>in tongue onely,</hi> but <hi>in deed,</hi> and in <hi>truth,</hi> in <hi>uprightneſſes,</hi> that is (as <hi>Buxtorf</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth it) <hi>Rectiſſime, fortiter,</hi> moſt intirely, intenſely <hi>ſincerely,</hi> thus I ſay it denoteth the truth, and reality of the believing Souls love to Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But our tranſlators have thought fit to tranſlate it otherwiſe conceiving the <hi>abſtract</hi> here put for the concrete, <hi>Uprightneſſes,</hi> for <hi>upright men</hi> poſſeſſed of uprightneſs, this is very uſual in the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> dialect, and indeed in moſt languages; ſo the ſenſe is this: Do not wonder, that <hi>I love Chriſt,</hi> and am ſo affected, with the injoyment of him, there is never an upright Soul in the world but loves him, all upright Souls love him; Thus the Propoſition is plain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Propoſ. Upright Souls love Chriſt.</hi> To this I ſhall Speak in my ordinary method by <hi>Explication, Confirmation, &amp; Application.</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the firſt, I ſhall give you the true notion of <hi>Uprightneſs</hi> and an üp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right ſoul, &amp; ſhew you in what ſenſe the Propoſition is true.</p>
               <p>The Queſtion may well be propounded, Who is the <hi>upright,</hi> who is the <hi>righteous man?</hi> For the Pſalmiſt tells us, &amp; the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. confirmeth it, <hi>There is none righteous, no not one,</hi> and although God at firſt made man upright <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7. 29. Yet the world is ſo warped, by men ſeeking out to themſelves inventions, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Micah,</hi> 7. 2. Tells us, <hi>there is none upright amongſt men.</hi> To reſolve this difficulty, I ſhall firſt give you two or three diſtinctions concerning <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> or <hi>uprightneſs,</hi> without which we ſhall hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtand the true notion of an upright man.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is an <hi>uprightneſs of heart. Pſal.</hi> 32. 11. <hi>Shout for joy all you upright in heart;</hi> ſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94. 11. Judgment ſhall return unto <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> and all the <hi>upright in heart</hi> ſhall follow it.

                     </gap> Pſal.</hi> 37. 14. The wicked man ſeeketh to ſlay <hi>ſuch as be of upright converſation.</hi> Indeed it is true, there is no man, who is <hi>upright in his heart,</hi> but he will alſo be <hi>upright in his way,</hi> for <hi>the upright directeth his way, Prov.</hi> 21. 29. but there is a ſeeming uprightneſs of way, when the heart is not upright with God. <hi>Prov.</hi> 14. 12. <hi>There is a way which ſeemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.</hi> The Propoſition muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of ſuch as are upright not in their way only ſeemingly, but both in heart and in way.</p>

                  <pb n="441" facs="tcp:61084:225"/>
2. Secondly there is a <hi>Legal,</hi> and there is an <hi>Evangelical righteouſneſs or uprightneſs.</hi> The legal <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> or <hi>uprightneſs</hi> lyeth in a <hi>full</hi> and <hi>perfect conformity to the Law of God.</hi> In this ſenſe it is as true, <hi>That there is none righteous, no not one,</hi> none <hi>upright amongſt men,</hi> as that there is none who liveth, and ſinneth not againſt God, for the leaſt Flye maketh this box of ointment to ſtink; all Sin is crooked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the leaſt crookedneſs ſpoileth this rightneſs. But then there is an <hi>Evangelical righteouſneſs, and uprightneſs,</hi> and thus every Soul, that is <hi>juſtified</hi> by grace <hi>through</hi> the imputation <hi>of Chriſts righteouſneſs is a righteous Soul;</hi> and every Soul that is <hi>Sanctifyed</hi> and <hi>renewed,</hi> the <hi>bent</hi> of which is towards God, and whoſe heart is ſincere before God, is an upright and righteous Soul. In this Senſe, the <hi>upright heart</hi> is the <hi>Sincere heart.</hi> Thus <hi>David</hi> ſaith of himſelf, I <hi>was upright be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22. 24. And God ſaith of Job, <hi>He is a perfect, and an upright man.</hi> The Propoſition muſt be underſtood of the latter, he that is <hi>Evangelically righteous,</hi> or <hi>upright;</hi> for there are none of the former upon the Earth, none that are <hi>legally righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly. As there are degrees of <hi>Sanctification,</hi> ſo there are <hi>degrees of uprightneſs.</hi> The text ſeems to ſpeak of the higheſt degrees, <hi>Uprightneſſes.</hi> It is very ordinary with the Hebrew to expreſs the <hi>Superlative</hi> degree, by the <hi>plural number;</hi> beſides this is Signified by putting the Abſtract for the <hi>Concrete,</hi> we uſually call men notoriouſly vile and wicked, by the Abſtract names of vice, and perſons eminently good and virtuous, by the Abſtract Names of virtue and goodneſs. Thoſe that are higheſt in grace, &amp; who do moſt excel in holineſs are fulleſt of love to Chriſt. Love teacheth every Child of God, the weakeſt <hi>babe in grace</hi> to <hi>cry</hi> after Chriſt, and the grown Chriſtian to delight in him, and to <hi>walk</hi> up <hi>and down in his name.</hi> Every righteous, every upright Soul loveth Chriſt, and that with a true, ſincere love, though not in an equal degree, ſhe (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>who</hi> hath much forgiven will <hi>love much.</hi> Having premiſed theſe diſtinctions, let me a little further inquire into the true Notion of theſe upright men, upright by this <hi>Evangelical</hi> rectitude.</p>
               <p>In ſhort they are ſuch as are <hi>juſtified,</hi> and <hi>Sanctified,</hi> made righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous through Chriſts righteouſneſs imputed to them, &amp; holy, through the <hi>Sanctification of his Spirit.</hi> 1. Such as are <hi>juſtified.</hi> This is the firſt thing requiſite to an <hi>upright,</hi> right man, let the unjuſtified Soul, be what it will, do what it can, it cannot be upright, either in <hi>heart</hi> or <hi>way.</hi> Suppoſe a ſtick naturally crooked, you may pare it and
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:61084:226"/>
paint, and colour it, and cover its crookedneſs alittle, but until it hath been in the fire, and bended right, it will be crooked ſtill; the natural man, the Soul not juſtified by grace, not waſhed with the blood of Chriſt may be pared by education, and brought off from ſome flagitious, and enormous practices, he may be coloured, and painted over by ſome acts of moral vertue, and ſome formal performances of religious duties, but ſtill in Gods Eye the Soul is a crooked Soul, until the Lord hath made it right, till it be juſtified by faith. 2. To this uprightneſs is required not only <hi>juſtification,</hi> or the removal of the Souls guilt, and imputation of a righteouſneſs, <hi>a perfect righteouſneſs, but the ſanctification of the heart,</hi> God never ſanctifieth any, whom he doth not juſtify, hence no Soul can be ſaid to be an upright Soul, that is not juſtified, nor doth the Lord at any time juſtify a Soul, but he at the ſame time alſo reneweth, and ſanctifieth it; hence the upright Soul muſt be a renewed, Sanctified Soul. But yet in regard our <hi>regeneration,</hi> and ſanctification, is not as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees <hi>perfect,</hi> (though as to parts Divines ſay it is, that is, the whole man is renewed) it may be yet worthy to be inquired from what degrees of <hi>Regeneration,</hi> and Sanctification, a man may be denominated an <hi>upright man;</hi> the rectitude of any thing is to be judged from its conformity to ſome rule. The rule of mans <hi>uprightneſs</hi> is the Lords Statutes, which are <hi>right,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 8. <hi>holy,</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> and <hi>juſt,</hi> and <hi>good,</hi> Rom. 7. <hi>Thy judgments are right,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 119. 75. 128. It is ſaid ſo of nothing elſe, ſo as from a conformity to this rule, muſt <hi>rightneſs,</hi> or <hi>uprightneſs</hi> be judged. And thus,</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is an <hi>uprightneſs of judgment, when the Soul judgeth according to truth,</hi> both concerning <hi>notions,</hi> and <hi>practices,</hi> when it judgeth aright concerning <hi>truth,</hi> and is not warped by <hi>error,</hi> and when it judgeth aright concerning the ways of God, then the Soul is <hi>upright,</hi> with reſpect to the <hi>underſtanding and judgment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. There is an <hi>uprightneſs of the whole Soul,</hi> with reſpect to the <hi>ſcope</hi> and <hi>bent of it,</hi> when the heart of man doth not ſtand inclined, and bent to ſin, but the Soul can ſay with <hi>David, I hate vain thoughts; but thy law do I love, I hate every falſe way,</hi> &amp;c. The man that in all his actions, deſigneth, and intendeth the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glory of God, and obedience to his will, though in many things he cometh ſhort, and offendeth, yet this man is an <hi>upright</hi> man, his end, and general ſcope is right.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="443" facs="tcp:61084:226"/>
3. There is an <hi>uprightneſs of will;</hi> in this the <hi>uprightneſs of a mans intention</hi> diſcovereth itſelf, when <hi>to will is preſent with the Soul,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. Though he wanteth a ſtrength to perform; the man or woman in heart willeth the honour and glory of God, and this not by <hi>fits,</hi> but ſteadily, and certainly, and is really unwilling to do any thing by which God may be diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, though through ignorance he may offend, and through a natural impotency, not being able to love the Lord with all his <hi>heart,</hi> and ſtrength, yea, and through moral impotency, and a mixt infirmity, through the great power of temptations, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the ſeduction of luſt, or the violent motions, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of Satan.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There is an <hi>uprightneſs of action,</hi> which lieth <hi>in a true, and ſincere endeavour to do the will of God,</hi> and by this both the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs of intention, and will alſo is to be judged. This is the upright man, though he may ſtumble and fall, and oft doth fail <hi>(who liveth, and ſinneth not againſt God?)</hi> And as theſe holy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions are found in the Soul in more remiſs, or intenſe degrees, ſo the Soul is more or leſs upright, and the man deſerves this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable denomination leſs or more. Theſe now are the Souls that <hi>love Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To love any object, whether perſon, or thing, ſignifieth to take a <hi>delight, and complacency in it.</hi> Whether in <hi>the thoughts of it</hi> (if abſent) as the Apoſtle ſaith, whom we having not ſeen, yet love, or in the <hi>contemplation,</hi> and <hi>fruition</hi> in <hi>converſe,</hi> and communion with it, if more preſent.</p>
               <p>This Praedicate concerning the <hi>upright,</hi> that they love Chriſt, is to be underſtood <hi>excluſively,</hi> and <hi>incluſively,</hi> concerning the <hi>Perſon of Chriſt,</hi> and whatſoever beareth his <hi>image,</hi> and <hi>ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Excluſively, theſe, and none but theſe love him.</hi> Others may talk of <hi>loving Chriſt,</hi> but it is but a talk and pretence, they love but in word, and tongue only, not in deed, and truth, there is ſomething elſe, either luſt or the world, ſomething or other that hath more of their affection, more of their heart then Chriſt hath.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Incluſively. Theſe, and all theſe love Chriſt,</hi> there is not an upright Soul in the world but loves Chriſt, and takes a pleaſure &amp; complacency in him, and preferreth him before his chief joy.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They <hi>love the perſon of Chriſt.</hi> He is in their Eyes <hi>altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>

               <p n="4">4. They love <hi>whatſoever bears the image, and ſuperſcription of Chriſt.</hi> The Goſpel, that gives them the hiſtory of Chriſt, and revealeth to them his will, the <hi>ordinances of Chriſt,</hi> in which the loves of Chriſt are ſet forth, repreſented, opened, applied to the Souls of people. <hi>The members of Chriſt,</hi> even every Soul in which they can but ſee <hi>aliquid Chriſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> (as <hi>Bucer</hi> ſpeaks) any thing of the features of Chriſt. This is enough to have ſpoken for the explication of the <hi>Propoſition.</hi> For the proof of it,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Look into the Word of God, ſee if you can find an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance either of an <hi>upright man,</hi> who did not love Chriſt, or of an <hi>bypocrite,</hi> or unregenerate man that did love him. <hi>Abraham believed,</hi> and it <hi>was imputed to him for righteouſneſs,</hi> he was one that walked with God, and was <hi>perfect,</hi> that is, upright, he loved Chriſt.

                     </gap>lene,</hi> all were upright Perſons, they all loved Chriſt. On the other ſide there is not ſo much as one inſtance of an unjuſtified, unregenerate Soul, that had any real love for Chriſt, no not when they ſaw him here in the fleſh. It is ſaid of the young Phariſee, who came to our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. that when Chriſt ſaw him, <hi>he loved him,</hi> but he had no love for Chriſt, for when he bid him <hi>go ſell all that he had, and he ſhould have treaſures in Heaven,</hi> it is ſaid he went away ſorrowful, for he had great poſſeſſions. <hi>Judas</hi> followed Chriſt, and ſo did the <hi>Capernaites,</hi> but <hi>Judas</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the bag, and the <hi>Capernaites</hi> followed him for the <hi>loaves.</hi> None of them loved Chriſt in <hi>ſincerity</hi> and <hi>truth.</hi> We need no other inſtances then what our own age affordeth us. But we need no Scripture in this caſe. Reaſon will evince the neceſſary truth of this Propoſition, if we conſider, that all love is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, either, 1. <hi>In the apprehended goodneſs and excellency of the object beloved:</hi> Or, 2. <hi>In ſome ſimilitude, and likeneſs,</hi> &amp;c. Or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>loweth, 3. <hi>From ſome inſtinct, of which we can give no very juſt account.</hi> I will begin with the laſt firſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Love</hi> to another often proceeds from ſome <hi>inaccountable</hi>
                  <pb n="445" facs="tcp:61084:227"/>
                  <hi>inſtinct;</hi> we ſee this very ordinary amongſt us, the heart of a woman cleaveth to a man, or of a man to a woman, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o the heart of one friend is knit to another, and we are able to give our ſelves no great account of it, the man loveth the woman, to whom he had a former averſion, and the woman loveth, and chuſeth the man for her Husband, that ſhe did never think of, and they can give themſelves no account of the change which they find in themſelves, this is undoubtedly a <hi>providential in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct</hi> or <hi>influence,</hi> of which we can give no account. The Souls <hi>love to Chriſt,</hi> alſo floweth from an inſtinct of God, an influence of ſpecial grace, for certainly if we muſt be taught of God, to love one another, to love the brethren, whom we have ſeen, and daily do ſee, and much that is lovely in them, we have much more need to be taught of God to <hi>love Chriſt,</hi> whom we have not ſeen, and whoſe excellency, and amiableneſs, is only matter of faith to us. Hence it appeareth, that no unrenewed, no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctified heart, none but the upright Soul can poſſibly love the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, for this love is no <hi>natural habit,</hi> no man by nature loveth Chriſt, nor is it any acquired habit, but an infuſed habit, and indeed a piece of regeneration.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Love</hi> to an object is <hi>founded in an apprehenſion of ſome good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and excellency in that object,</hi> we cannot love any object, that appeareth to us <hi>evil,</hi> or <hi>unlovely.</hi> Now none but the renewed, and regenerate Soul can poſſibly ſee any goodneſs and excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in Chriſt, for it is ſpiritually diſcerned, beſides, the reaſon of love in us to any object, is not ſo much the abſtracted goodneſs, and excellency of the object, as its relative goodneſs unto us; now none but the Soul that is juſtified, and regenerate Soul hath in any thing taſted of the love of God, or hath found him in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny degree good as to it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Laſtly, Whereas <hi>love is founded in likeneſs,</hi> in ſome ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of nature, or diſpoſition, and qualities, there is ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimilitude between a natural man, whether he be one that is <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane</hi> and <hi>flagitious,</hi> or meerly <hi>moral,</hi> and <hi>formal,</hi> and <hi>hypocritica<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>,</hi> that this Soul cannot love the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is holy, and harmleſs, and ſeparate from ſinners; and the very ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons make it neceſſary for every Soul to love Chriſt, for every ſuch Soul is renewed, and regenerate, and taught of God to love the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, every ſuch Soul is beloved of him, and under ſome apprehenſions, and experience of the love of
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:61084:228"/>
God in Chriſt unto it; every ſuch Soul (finally) hath the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God renewed in it, in righteouſneſs and holineſs, and by grace wrought up into a conformity to Chriſt, and the more upright the Soul is, the more is the image of God renewed in it, the more it hath taſted the ſpecial love of Chriſt, the more it hath received of the potent influences of Divine Grace, hence it muſt needs love Chriſt more. I now come to the application.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Uſe 1.</note> In the firſt place, This may let us know, <hi>That Chriſt is a moſt excelling object, and the non-adherence</hi> of our hearts to him, is a piece of the <hi>natural crookedneſs, and defection of the Soul of man.</hi> The goodneſs or excellency of an object is not to be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from a vulgar judgment. <hi>Learning</hi> is an excellent thing, the fooliſh ignorant perſon doth not ſo judge it, nor look after it, this detracts nothing from the excellency of it. Wiſe men value it. It hath no enemies but the ignorant man. Now the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the beſt and wiſer part of the world, their value, and prizing of it, is enough to commend it, though <hi>fools hate know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi> So the <hi>upright mans loving Chriſt,</hi> is a ſufficient evidence of the tranſcendent goodneſs, and excellency that is in him, tho the looſe, and profane man, the formal, hypocritical man hath no love at all for him. There are thouſands in the world (in the Chriſtian world) whoſe converſations teſtify, that they can ſee no beauty, no excellency in Chriſt at all, to them he grows up <hi>as a root out of a dry ground, in their Eyes he hath no beauty, no comelineſs at all.</hi> They ſtand, and admire what ſweetneſs Gods people have in their meditations, and contemplations of him, what is that ſometimes makes them ſo <hi>ſick of love for him, ſo breaking with longings after him</hi> (as holy <hi>David</hi> expreſſeth it.) The buſineſs is not what fools judge of Wiſdom in the mean time, <hi>Wiſdom is juſtified of her Children.</hi> It is enough that the <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right love him.</hi> The upright men, are the beſt men in the world. But you will ſay, were there ſuch a beauty, ſuch an excellency in Chriſt, why ſhould not every rational man enquire after him, and love him? The anſwer is eaſy. Becauſe his beauty, his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency is not obvious to the <hi>Eye of ſenſe,</hi> or to the <hi>Eye of reaſon,</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king from its own principles, but only to the <hi>Eye of faith,</hi> &amp; that of <hi>reaſon,</hi> working upon <hi>revealed principles.</hi> The goodneſs &amp; excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Chriſt conſidered as <hi>Mediator,</hi> doth not lie in a ſuitableneſs to our <hi>bodily wants,</hi> no nor to the wants of our Souls, conſidered only as rational <hi>and ſpiritual Beings;</hi> but in his ſuitableneſs to our

                  <hi>Souls</hi> conſidered as <hi>lapſed,</hi> and fallen from the happy ſtate where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they were at firſt created, and by that fall expoſed to the wrath of God, here, and hereafter. Now this is revealed only in Holy Writ, and is to be diſcerned only by the Eye of faith. So as thoſe who do not by a firm and ſteady aſſent, agree to the <hi>revelation of the word,</hi> cannot poſſibly ſee any excellency in Chriſt as a Saviour, and Mediator between God and Man.</p>

                  </hi> they are ready to ſpeak to the ſame ſenſe, tho in ruder language, what is the <hi>beloved</hi> of this Soul, more then anothers beloved; what makes theſe people ſo full of prayers, and tears, ſo full of duty, ſo fond of the ordinances of Chriſt? This juſtifies ſuch Souls in all their pantings after Chriſt, in all the paſſions of their Souls for him, <hi>The upright love him.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly.</hi> From hence Chriſtians may take meaſures of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and make up a judgment of their Souls, whether they be upright Souls, yea, or no, very much lieth upon this, many are the promiſes that in Holy Writ we ſhall find made to <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right</hi> Souls. <hi>Perfection</hi> of <hi>degrees</hi> is our mark, but what in this life we cannot attain unto, all perfection we are capable of, is <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs,</hi> this may be attained, we are therefore highly concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to inquire upon our <hi>uprightneſs.</hi> By this we ſhall know it; <hi>The Soul that truly loveth Chriſt, that is an upright Soul,</hi> ſo as that which we have to examine, is the truth of our love to Chriſt.
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:61084:229"/>
This inquiry alſo is conſiderable in reſpect of the Apoſtolical <hi>Anathema,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 22. <hi>If any man love not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, let him be</hi> Anathema Maranatha. It is a great point, how a Chriſtian ſhall certainly know his ſpiritual ſtate? he ſhall know it by his <hi>uprightneſs?</hi> how ſhall he know his <hi>uprightneſs?</hi> that is to be known by his <hi>love to Chriſt.</hi> But will ſome ſay, is not this as hard to be diſcerned as any thing elſe? I anſwer; ſurely no. If it be no hard thing for a man to know whether he loves ſuch a woman, or a woman to know that ſhe loveth ſuch a man, or for any to know they love ſuch a friend, ſuch a companion, why ſhould it be ſo hard for a Soul to know whether it loveth Chriſt or no? love will work much in the ſame manner towards all its objects, and though the viſibility, and ſenſibility of ſome objects, may draw out more of our paſſion, and exceſſes of affection, yet the <hi>reality</hi> and <hi>truth</hi> of our love may certainly be as well diſcerned re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a ſpiritual, and inviſible object as to one, that is more the object of our exteriour ſenſes, let us therefore try thoſe meaſures, and ſee how we will make up our judgment of the truth of our love to a fellow creature; what is that which we call <hi>love,</hi> but the delight, and <hi>complacency,</hi> and <hi>ſatisfaction of the Soul</hi> in an object beloved, declared by the <hi>pantings</hi> and <hi>breathings</hi> of the heart after it, when abſent, for an <hi>union,</hi> or <hi>re-union</hi> with it, the <hi>acquieſcence</hi> and <hi>meltings</hi> of the heart upon it, when pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and an union with it is obtained, or apprehended; the Souls intercourſe and communion with it, and free communications of its ſelf unto it, its kindneſs to every perſon or thing, to whom, or which the object beloved, hath any relation, its patient, and pleaſing bearing his reproofs, its readineſs to go, or run, or do any thing at the will, and command of ſuch a perſon, its ſtanding up in the defence of him or her, its riſing up againſt any that would do them injury, or that it hears ſpeak reproachfully, or diminutively of him. It's readineſs to ſuffer any thing for his ſake, &amp;c. Surely by ſome or all theſe notes we may try our love to Chriſt, and be as certain of it, as we can be of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of our love to any fellow creature; let me therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire you to propound theſe few queſtions to your ſelves.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>How far is Chriſt the object of thy thoughts?</hi> We ſay, <hi>

                     </gap> amor ibi oculus,</hi> where <hi>love</hi> is, there the <hi>Eye will be;</hi> the reaſon of that is, becauſe our thoughts are much imployed about the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:61084:230"/>
of our love, <hi>where our treaſure is</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>there will our hearts be alſo,</hi> the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> therefore ſpeaking of the wicked man who hath no love for God, ſaith, <hi>God is not in all his thoughts. Pſal.</hi> 10. 4. So long as we live in the world, the things of it are ſo much, and ſo continually the objects of our ſenſes, that it is not to be expected, but that our thoughts ſhould in a great meaſure be exerciſed about the things of it, ſo that I would not put the iſſue upon that, whether the <hi>world</hi> or <hi>Chriſt</hi> have moſt of our thoughts? but certainly Chriſt will be much in the thoughts of that Soul in whom the love of Chriſt is, <hi>Te veniente die, te decedente canebat</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Poet</hi> of the <hi>lover)</hi> the Soul that loveth Chriſt, will think of him in the evening when he <hi>lieth down, and in the morning when he riſeth up,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> had his <hi>waking thoughts</hi> in the night ſeaſon with God. God will not have all of the beſt mans thoughts, becauſe he is but fleſh, and hath ſome thoughts to take about what he ſhall eat, and drink, and put on, but God will have much of his thoughts. Chriſt will be much in the thoughts of that Soul that truly loveth him. Secondly.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>How are the motions of thy Soul after an abſent Chriſt?</hi> Chriſt as to his perſon is alwaies abſent, that the Heavens muſt contain till the end of the World, but he is or may be graciouſly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in his <hi>inſtitutions,</hi> and with reſpect to his <hi>gracious influences,</hi> and with reſpect to both theſe he is often, or may be abſent; the firſt makes up the <hi>deſertion of a Church,</hi> when it is general, or a particular perſon, when it is only the affliction of a particular Soul in ſome caſes, and by ſome ſeverer providences kept from the ordinances of God; the ſecond is, the particular <hi>deſertion</hi> of a gracious Soul, not as to neceſſary, but as to gradual influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; now how is thy Soul affected to <hi>Chriſt abſent,</hi> when thou canſt not enjoy the <hi>Ordinances of Chriſt,</hi> as thou haſt formerly enjoyed them? You ſee the heart and affection of <hi>David</hi> in this cafe, in divers Pſalms, particularly <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84. what breathings, what longings, what impatience doth he there expreſs? So when thou ſuſpecteſt his abſence as to the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſpecial influences of his grace, how doth thy heart move to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward him? doth it move as the heart of the Spouſe moved in the third and 5th Chapters of this admirable Song, <hi>Seeking him, ſighing after him,</hi> enquiring of all like to inform thee, how thou mighteſt recover thy loſt peace, being reſtleſs till thou haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered it? This is a ſign of love.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="451" facs="tcp:61084:230"/>
3. How is thy heart <hi>affected</hi> in any preſence or <hi>enjoyment of Chriſt?</hi> What pleaſure, what delight and complacency hath thy Soul in the inſtitutions of Chriſt, in the manifeſtations of his love to thy Soul. See the inſtance of the Spouſe as to this, <hi>Can.</hi> 3. 4. <hi>I found him whom my Soul loveth, I held him, and would not let him go, until I had brought him into my Mothers Houſe, and into the Chamber of her that conceived me.</hi> v. 5. <hi>1 charge you O you Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of</hi> Hieruſalem, <hi>by the Roes, and by the Hinds of the field, that you ſtir not up, nor awake my love, until he pleaſe.</hi> A rejoycing in the ſigns of his love, being glad, and reſolving not again to part with him, a fear of offending him, and care to pleaſe him, are all of them ſigns of a love to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>A freedom of converſe, and communion with him,</hi> alſo ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth love. Chriſt proves himſelf his Diſciples friend, becauſe <hi>he had made known to them whatſoever he had received from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> Joh. 15. 15. <hi>Dalilab</hi> challenged <hi>Sampſon</hi> for want of love to her, becauſe he had concealed his ſecrets from her. The with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of prayer from God, the want of frequency, freedom, and boldneſs in prayer, ſpeaks want of love to Chriſt in the Soul; frequency, freedom, and boldneſs, holy boldneſs ſpeaks a Soul full of love to Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>What affections haſt thou to thoſe things and perſons,</hi> that have a relation to Chriſt, that bear his image and ſuperſcription, the Word and Ordinances of God, the Miniſters and People of God; by this you ſhall know your love to Chriſt. Again—</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>How canſt thou bear the reproofs of Chriſt?</hi> Our nature doth not love reproof, we muſt love thoſe very well, from whom we take reproof quietly. <hi>Let the righteous ſmite me</hi> (ſaith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid) it ſhall be as an excellent Oil, which ſhall not break my head</hi> When a Chriſtian can bear the <hi>verbal</hi> reproofs of Chriſts Word, and Miniſters, and the real reproofs and chaſtenings of his rod It is a ſign of love.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>What zeal haſt thou for the honour and glory of Chriſt?</hi> Canſt thou not hear him reproached, but that his reproaches fall on thee, thy blood riſeth, and thy heart is troubled? It is an argument of little love for God or Chriſt, when we can patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hear them abuſed, and diſhonoured, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69. 9. <hi>The zeal of thine houſe</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) hath eaten me up, and the reproaches of them that reproached thee, are fallen on me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. I muſt not forget that of our Saviour, <hi>If you love me, keep</hi>

                  <hi>my Commandments.</hi> No Soul can ſo much as pretend to a love to Chriſt, that makes no conſcience of keeping the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The Soul, laſtly, that hath a love for Chriſt, will <hi>ſuffer any thing for his ſake,</hi> it will rather ſuffer the loſs of all things, then the loſs of Chriſts favour. By theſe and ſuch like queſtions, and notes as theſe, it will be no hard matter for a Soul to judge of its love to Chriſt, and by that it will be able to judge, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine concerning its uprightneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Uſe. 3.</note> In the laſt place doth every Soul that is upright love Chriſt, and are the degrees of the Souls uprightneſs according to the degrees of the Souls love, <hi>How do we then all ſtand concerned to love Chriſt?</hi> In order to it,</p>

               <p>As the tents of Kedar: as the Curtains of Solomon.] They are certainly two ſimilitudes which the Spouſe brings elegantly to ſet forth what ſhe had ſaid, either concerning her <hi>blackneſs,</hi> or concerning her <hi>beauty and comelineſs.</hi> Only the queſtion is, whether the ſenſe be this; I am black <hi>like the tents of Kedar,</hi> and like the Curtains of <hi>Solomon:</hi> but I am alſo (like them) comely alſo: Or thus, I am, I confeſs, <hi>black,</hi> like the Tents of <hi>Kedar:</hi> but I am alſo <hi>comely like the Curtains</hi> of <hi>Solomon.</hi> The letter pleaſeth me beſt becauſe we read nothing of any black Curtains, that <hi>Solomon made</hi> for the Temple, and it is moſt likely he kept the colours of the Curtains of the Tabernacle which were <hi>Blue, Purple</hi> and <hi>Scarlet. Redar</hi> was one of the Sons of <hi>Iſhmael</hi> as you read <hi>Gen.</hi> 25. 13. It is probable that he did build ſome, City in <hi>Arabia</hi> which (as was very uſual) he called after his owne name.

               </p>
               <p>Like the Curtains of Solomon.] This I take to relate to the latter part of the Spouſes words. <hi>Solomon</hi> made <hi>Curtains</hi> for the Temple, and it is very likely they were made in Proportion to thoſe which were made (by Gods Preſcription) for the <hi>Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, Exod</hi> 36. 8. <hi>of fine twined Linnen, Blue, Purple, and Scarlet, with Cherubims of cunning works;</hi> the Spouſe compareth her ſelf to theſe for comelineſs.</p>
               <p>Look not upon me becauſe I am black.] That is, you Daughters of <hi>Hieruſalem, look not upon me.</hi> The <hi>Chaldee Paraphraſt</hi> maketh this the voice of the Jewiſh Church ſpeaking to the Heathens thus: <hi>O you Heathen Nations! do not deſpsſe me becauſe I have made my ſelf blacker then you by doing after your deeds, Worſhipping the Sun, Moon, and all the hoſt of Heaven; falſe Prophets, have made me to err after your ways by which means the wrath of the Lord is poured out upon me.</hi> The reaſon of this interpretation is their dream that they are the only Church of God in the World. But the text is not to be ſo reſtrained. The <hi>true Church of Chriſt,</hi> or the <hi>truly believing Soul</hi> here ſpeaks unto any others: That they would not look aſquint upon her becauſe ſhe was <hi>black; Ne tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vum intueamini, nec velut per contemptum deſpiciatis,</hi> (ſo <hi>Mercer</hi> gloſſeth upon the words) do not look upon me with an Eye of deſpight, ſcorn or, contempt. <hi>As the Leviat han beholdeth all things Job</hi> 41. 34.

               <p>There is yet another ſenſe of the words hinted by <hi>Delrio</hi> and <hi>Genebrard.</hi> It is this, <hi>They intangled me in ſecular affairs, ſo made me neglect the things which were Spiritual and of much higher con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment to me.</hi> This now is a third cauſe, which the Spouſe aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of <hi>her blackneſs:</hi> 1. She had before told us ſhe was <hi>Scorched</hi> with <hi>afflictions and perſecutions.</hi> The <hi>Sun</hi> had looked upon her. 2. She had <hi>been betrayed,</hi> by her own luſts, and by falſe brethren,
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:61084:236"/>
and ſeduced her to intertain their corruptions, to keep their <hi>Vineyards,</hi> now ſhe tells us That her <hi>ſecular diverſions,</hi> did alſo much contribute to her darkneſs, ſhe had been made to ſerve in the brick-kilns of the world. <hi>Keeping of Vineyards</hi> was a great deal of the labour of thoſe Countrys a painful and labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous imployment; therefore you read, 2 <hi>Kings.</hi> 25. 12. upon the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Babylons</hi> conqueſt of <hi>Judea</hi> that the <hi>Captain of the guard left of the poor of the land to be Vine-dreſſers &amp; huſbandmen;</hi> &amp; thoſe who in the parable had been labouring in the Vineyard tell the Lord of the <hi>Vineyard,</hi> they had born the burden and heat of the day.</p>
               <p>My own Vineyard I have not kept.] Here now the Spouſe aſſigneth a fourth cauſe of her <hi>blackneſs.</hi> The queſtion here is, what is meant by <hi>her own Vineyard?</hi> It is manifeſtly to be underſtood of ſomething which the Lord had committed to her to <hi>keep,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the <hi>Church as</hi> the <hi>Spouſe.</hi> The <hi>Oracles</hi> of God were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the <hi>Church of the Jews</hi> (as the Apoſtle telleth us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 2. and the Church is called, <hi>The pillar</hi> and <hi>ground of Truth,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>Paul</hi> tell us. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 11. that the <hi>glorious Goſpel of the bleſſed God was committed to his truſt,</hi> and telleth <hi>Timothy</hi> the Miniſtry was <hi>committed to his truſt.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls it <hi>his Goſpel</hi> upon this account, <hi>Rom.</hi> 26. 25. and ſaith they were put <hi>in truſt with the Goſpel,</hi> that is, the <hi>Cuſtody</hi> and <hi>Miniſtration of it.</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> commandeth <hi>Timothy</hi> to commit the things <hi>which he had heard of him, amongſt many witneſſes to faithful men, who ſhould be able to teach others.</hi> That general term of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth both the <hi>Propoſitions of the Truth,</hi> and Doctrine of Faith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the new <hi>Teſtament</hi> and alſo thoſe excellent rules which are to be found in it, relating both to the <hi>Worſhip of God,</hi> and the <hi>Government of the Church of Chriſt,</hi> &amp; the <hi>diſpenſation</hi> and <hi>admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of it.</hi> This <hi>Goſpel</hi> as to the <hi>Miniſtration</hi> of it was by Chriſt committed, firſt to the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> to be by them tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>faithful</hi> and <hi>able men,</hi> as to the keeping of it to the <hi>whole Church.</hi> The Church of <hi>Sardis, Rev.</hi> 3. 8. is commended, for <hi>keeping Chriſts word, and</hi> not <hi>denying his name.</hi> This undoubtedly is the Churches <hi>Vineyard.</hi> The <hi>Province</hi> which God hath betruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to her to keep. But every particular Soul hath a <hi>Vineyard</hi> too. And what is its <hi>Vineyard</hi> but its immortal Soul, and the particular truſt which God hath committed to it, with relation both to its ſelf and others? What is the <hi>keeping of this Vineyard,</hi>

but a Chriſtians obſervance of the duties incumbent upon him, with reference to his more <hi>general,</hi> or more <hi>particular calling?</hi> So that underſtanding by the Spouſe the particular Chriſtian, ſhe complaineth here of her own voluntary neglect, and careleſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as to her own Soul, ſuffering the weeds of luſts and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions to grow up, and to prevail, according to that of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, I paſſed by the Vineyard of him who was vaid of underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and to, it was overgrown with thorns: Nettles had covered the face thereof, and the ſtone-wall thereof was broken down, Prov.</hi> 24. 30, 31.

               <p>I Shall now begin a larger diſcourſe upon thoſe <hi>Propoſitions</hi> which I did but name the laſt time after my explication of this, and the next verſes. I will join the two firſt, and handle them ſeverally, then apply them jointly.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Prop. 1.</note> The Spouſe of Chriſt on this ſide of Heaven, hath her blackneſs, expoſing her to the reproach and obloquy of others, but ſhe is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo comely, and therefore ought not to be looked upon, becauſe ſhe is black.</p>
               <p>My buſineſs in the handling of this <hi>Propoſition</hi> will chiefly lie in theſe two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, Shewing you wherein lies the Spouſes blackneſs, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing her to the obloquy of others.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, Shewing you wherein her comelineſs lieth. The confirmation I ſhall mix with the <hi>explication.</hi> By the <hi>Spouſe</hi> here I have all along underſtood, <hi>the believing Soul, &amp; the Church of Chriſt,</hi> which is a body made up of theſe as its Members, they have both their <hi>blackneſs,</hi> for which they are expoſed to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquy of others.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, <hi>Sins, and Corruptions make them black.</hi> The beſt of men, are but as white Swans, with black feet, they have in them a body of death, a law in their members rebelling againſt the law of their mind, the <hi>fleſh luſting</hi> againſt the Spirit, and they are many times brought into a captivity to the law of their members, and though theſe motions to ſin be ordinarily ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, yet they ſometimes <hi>break</hi> out. The Pride of one, and the ſſionate anger and wrath of another, and other luſts in others
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:61084:238"/>
often break out unſeemly, and make even the beſt of Gods Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple appear black, the <hi>habituated Sinner</hi> is all <hi>black,</hi> there is in him no whiteneſs, no comelineſs at all. The <hi>glorified Saint</hi> is all <hi>white,</hi> there is in him <hi>no blackneſs</hi> at all. The <hi>militant Saint,</hi> is partly white, and in part black. All ſin is black. Chriſt therefore in <hi>juſtification</hi> makes the Soul <hi>white</hi> through his blood, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. 14. <hi>They are made white in the blood of the Lamb.</hi> In regeneration they are made white; cleanſed through the <hi>waſhing of water, Eph.</hi> 5. 21. Hence, Chriſt tells his Diſciples, except <hi>I waſh you,</hi> you can never be <hi>made clean;</hi> they are clean, but yet had need <hi>waſh their ſeet, John</hi> 13. 10. If there be in us any thing of faith, yet there is alſo much of <hi>unbelief;</hi> who liveth, and ſinneth not? the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous man falleth ſeven times in a day, <hi>and who can tell how often he offendeth?</hi> and though indeed the luſt and corruption, that is in a good mans heart, doth not commonly break out into ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous acts, which ſtanders by take notice of, yet ſometimes they do. <hi>Lot</hi> and <hi>Noah</hi> were both overtaken with Wine, <hi>David</hi> was overco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e by the <hi>ſtranger</hi> that came to his Houſe. <hi>Peter</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied his Maſter. <hi>Solomon, Aſa, Jehoſaphat,</hi> all the good Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> had their great Errors, which are as black ſpots upon their memories to this day. And beſides the blot which theſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of corruption leave upon the particular Souls, they leave alſo a <hi>blackneſs</hi> in the Church, which is made up of them. Beſides that, there is no Church but hath in it ſome of unſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied hearts, who as <hi>Jude</hi> tells us, are <hi>ſpots in our feaſts of chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and where they prevail in number, they bring in alſo another blackneſs upon the Church, by admiſſion of corruptions, in Doctrine, Worſhip, and Diſcipline, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Particular Souls are alſo <hi>black through acts of mortification.</hi> The people of God live a dying life; <hi>I die daily</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul)</hi> they keep under their Bodies, that they may keep them in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to their Spirits. Now though there is nothing makes a Soul to look more white, and beautiful in the Eyes of God, yet nothing makes them appear more <hi>black</hi> and unlovely in the Eyes of the world. The world looks upon Chriſtians chaſtiſing themſelves with faſting, and tears, in their dejections, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliations, as very black, but this is indeed no real, but an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing blackneſs, to ſuch as underſtand no lovelineſs in any thing but ſenſuality.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The People of God are often <hi>black through afflictions. Job</hi>
                  <pb n="467" facs="tcp:61084:238"/>
ſpeaking of affliction ſaith, <hi>Job</hi> 30. 30. <hi>My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burnt with heat.</hi> Hence the afflicted faces are ſaid to <hi>gather blackneſs, Joel</hi> 1. 6. <hi>Nahum</hi> 2. 10. The skin of the Church in the hour of her affliction, is ſaid to have been <hi>as black as a Raven, Lam.</hi> 5. 10. and it is ſaid of the <hi>afflicted Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites,</hi> Lam. 4. 8. <hi>That their viſage was more black then a Coal.</hi> So that you ſee <hi>Affliction</hi> is every where in Scripture called <hi>Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> Now there is no Child of God in this life <hi>exempted</hi> from <hi>afflictions,</hi> ſuch as are from the hand of God immediately, of which nature are <hi>deſertions, terrors, and Soul troubles</hi> of ſeveral ſorts, <hi>bodily diſtempers,</hi> &amp;c. or from <hi>Satan</hi> more immediately, of which nature are <hi>temptations.</hi> Or from <hi>the world,</hi> in perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and injuries by it done unto them, and the Spouſe ſeemeth to have a particular reſpect to theſe, for ſhe adds, <hi>my Mothers Children were angry with me.</hi> And as the particular Soul is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to theſe blackneſſes, ſo is the Church.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Through a mixture of ill members,</hi> ſuch as (to uſe <hi>Judes</hi> phraſe) are <hi>ſpots</hi> in the Churches feaſts of charity. Such no Church of God hath been free from in any age, ſome that are corrupt in their tenets, and principles, others that are ſo in their converſations. God denominates his Church from the ſincere, and better part of it, but the world alwaies denominates it from the worſer part, and cries—<hi>Crimine ab uno diſce omnes,</hi> they are all alike, hence there is no man cauſeth the name of God to be ſo reproached, and evil ſpoken of, as perſons profeſſing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and memberſhip in Churches, and living looſely, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing corrupt in their Doctrines, and Principles.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Church becomes black, <hi>Through the admiſſion of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in Doctrine, Worſhip, or Diſcipline. All deviation from the Divine Rule</hi> (where it is a ſufficient rule in the caſe) is the black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of any Church; it is a wonderful thing to obſerve how prone the heart of man is to this. Though the Church of the Jews had a more infallible rule, and more plain in this caſe, then any other Church can pretend to. Yet I cannot find that ever the Worſhip of God continued in it in purity fourſcore years. The longeſt was the time of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> who each of them reigned <hi>forty years,</hi> but in the latter part of <hi>Solomons time,</hi> it admitted of much corruption, there was a great toleration of <hi>Idolatry</hi> (as you read in the ſtory) and you ſhall obſerve in the whole Hiſtory of that Church, in how few Kings Reigns, the
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:61084:239"/>
                  <hi>high places,</hi> and the <hi>groves</hi> were taken away, and when they were taken away in one Kings Reign, how ſoon they grew in faſhion again in the next, though there were no ſins for which the Jews ſo ſeverely ſmarted, nor againſt which the wrath of God was more ſeverely declared by the Prophets God ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them. If (in the <hi>New Teſtament)</hi> you look over the Epiſtles wrote to the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and <hi>Galatia,</hi> and the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> you will again find the ſame thing; it is true, every deviation from truth, or from the purity of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> or diſcipline, will not unchurch a Church, the Lord hateth putting away; concerning <hi>Idolatry,</hi> I know not what to ſay, that is a Spiritual Adultery, and every where in Scripture is call'd <hi>Whoredom,</hi> and going a <hi>Whoring,</hi> and as <hi>divorce</hi> was lawful in caſe of carnal adultery, ſo poſſibly it may be preſumed as to ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual adultery, that God hath ſaid to a People <hi>Lo-ammi,</hi> you are not my people who are lapſed to idolatry: but for other failings, tho the Lord liketh them not, but hath ſomething againſt every Church that admits any corruptions of this nature, yet they are but <hi>ſpots</hi> and <hi>blemiſhes,</hi> and how far a ſeparation from ſuch a Church may be <hi>lawful,</hi> or is <hi>ſinful,</hi> is a great queſtion. I think a total ſeparation is not. But that is not my task at preſent to diſcourſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The Church alſo may be black through perſecutions.</hi> The af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted ſtate of the Church is called a <hi>lying amongſt the pots, Pſal.</hi> 68. 13. Probably there may be a time towards the end of the World, when the true Church of Chriſt may enioy ſome tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity, and enjoy a more ſerene, quiet, and fixed ſtate then it hath yet enjoyed, or doth at this day enjoy, when it ſhall not be ſo incumbred by the Croſs, and thoſe tribulations, by which Chriſtians have hitherto entred into the Kingdom of God; there have been ſome both more ancient and modern Divines, who have inclined to think, that yet before the end of the World, Chriſt ſhall reign upon the Earth a <hi>thouſand years,</hi> but whether that time which we call <hi>the day of Judgment,</hi> ſhall laſt ſo long, or thoſe thouſand years ſhall be a ſpace of time preceding the laſt judgment, whether thoſe Scriptures which are uſually interpreted in favour of that opinion, ſignifying Chriſts being heve in Perſon, or only a quiet, and more tranquil eſtate of the Church, are queſtions which I ſhall not undertake to determine. But as the hiſtory of the Goſpel Church hitherto juſtifieth, that
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:61084:239"/>
it hath been a ſtate of affliction, and blackneſs; ſo moſt Divines are pretty well agreed, that we are not to expect any other, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til thoſe <hi>thouſand years</hi> do begin, ſo as in this reſpect we muſt look to ſee the Church of Chriſt <hi>black,</hi> however white ſhe be upon other accounts. Now thus the Spouſe is black, not in Gods Eyes, who judgeth not according to <hi>outward appearance,</hi> but <hi>according to the heart,</hi> and in his judgment of men counteth none the worſe, for what happeneth to them <hi>from the World,</hi> or from <hi>the Devil,</hi> and though he cannot look upon iniquity in the beſt ſo as to approve of it, yet doth he not judge of them according to their failings, but giveth an allowance both for their <hi>infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,</hi> and <hi>temptations,</hi> upon which account he calleth to us to <hi>behold the patience of Job,</hi> though <hi>Job</hi> had his fits of frowardneſs, and impatience, and often calleth his Spouſe <hi>fair,</hi> and <hi>undefiled,</hi> though ſhe hath many <hi>defilements.</hi> But.</p>

2. Secondly (which poſſibly is here chiefly intended) <hi>She is black in the Eyes of others.</hi> The World dealeth by the Diſciples of Chriſt, as it dealt with him (nor is it reaſonable to expect that the Diſciple ſhould be above his Maſter, or the Servant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove his Lord) they <hi>ſaw Chriſt deſpiſed and rejected of men, a man of ſorrows, and acquainted with griefs, they hid their faces from him, and eſteemed him not.</hi> The men of the world ſee the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, men of ſorrows, and acquainted with griefs, they deſpiſe them, and eſteem them not, yea, for the moſt part their buſineſs is to <hi>blacken</hi> them, loading them with <hi>reproach</hi> and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny, and laying to their charge things which they know not, and all this through an implacable enmity, put betwixt the <hi>ſeed of the Woman, and the ſeed of the Serpent,</hi> or becauſe they ſee themſelves condemned by the more righteous converſation of ſuch as fear God.

ſhe may-ſuffer ſome erroneous principles to be publiſhed in her, that is her <hi>blackneſs</hi> but ſhe keepeth the foundation doctrines of <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>holineſs</hi> pure, and incorrupt; that is her <hi>comelineſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>In much of her blackneſs there is a beauty, and a comelineſs.</hi> It is <hi>Bernards</hi> note, whatſoever is black is not therefore <hi>uncomely.</hi> The Eye is black, yet comely. Marble is black, but yet it is comely. Chriſt is <hi>black</hi> but yet he was comely. Look upon him (ſaith that devout man,) clothed with raggs, <hi>blew with</hi> Stripes, daubed with his Enemies Spittle, pale with death, you will ſay he was black, but yet he was comely, yea the <hi>Chiefeſt of ten thouſand.</hi> The Apoſtles ſaw him <hi>comely</hi> when upon the mountain they beheld his glory at his transfiguration. Nay in his <hi>blackneſs</hi> there was <hi>comlineſs,</hi> to ſee him under all this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming obedient to his Fathers will, even unto death, the bitter death upon the Croſs, working out the redemption and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all thoſe whom the Father had given him; this was come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. When <hi>the word was made fleſh and dwelt amongſt us</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>John) we beheld his glory as the glory of the only begotten Son of God, full of grace and truth.</hi> Look upon the Child of God, as daubed, and beſmeared with the <hi>filth</hi> and <hi>obloquy</hi> which the men of the World caſt upon him: Scorched with Afflictions, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with dark, and helliſh temptations; ſo indeed he looketh black in our carnal Eyes but in other reſpects he is comely, even in this <hi>blackneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. As by theſe afflictions <hi>Chriſt is magnified in his body,</hi> and he is made <hi>conformable unto Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>filling up what is lacking in the ſufferings of Chriſt:</hi> So he is <hi>comely.</hi> All conformity to Chriſt is <hi>beauty,</hi> Paul deſired no more then <hi>that he might know him, and the power of his reſurrection and the fellowſhip of his ſufferings, and be made comformable unto his death, Philip.</hi> 3. 11. This is what our Saviour told his diſciples, <hi>John</hi> 15. to comfort them under the Worlds hatred which he knew would make them to appear black, <hi>If the World hateth you it hated me firſt.</hi> The ſuffering child of God lookes black, but as Chriſt is by his ſufferings <hi>magnified in his body</hi> as he is by his ſufferings made more like to Chriſt, ſo he is comely.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly.</hi> As a believers afflictions perfect him for glory, ſo even in his blackneſs there is a comelineſs. <hi>The Captain of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation was</hi> made perfect <hi>(as the Apoſtle tells us)</hi> through ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Heb. <hi>2. 10. and ſo muſt the Souldiers under this Captain be</hi>

                  <hi>made perfect, for</hi> by much tribulation they alſo muſt enter into the Kingdom of God. By this <hi>(ſaith the Lord, ſpeaking of the</hi> Afflictions of <hi>Jacob)</hi> ſhall the iniquity of <hi>Jacob</hi> be purged, and all the fruit ſhall be to take away Sin. <hi>Afflictions to the Church and People of God, are but as the</hi> furnace for the Silver, <hi>and</hi> the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining pot for the Gold, <hi>like poliſhing Irons to the Stone, and the File to the Steel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Finally. There is a <hi>comelineſs in this blackneſs,</hi> as Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons give the Spouſe <hi>advantage, and opportunities for the more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and perſpicuous exerciſes of their graces.</hi> Faith never ſhineth ſo much as in a dark place, and ſtate; now for a ſeaſon (ſaith <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 7.) <hi>You are in heavineſs through manifold temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> (their was their <hi>blackneſs)</hi> but it followeth, <hi>That the tryal of your faith being much more precious then that of Gold which periſheth, might be found unto praiſe, honour, and glory.</hi> There now was a comelineſs in their blackneſs; <hi>though he killeth me</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job) yet will I truſt in him,</hi> there again was <hi>comelineſs</hi> in <hi>blackneſs. Patience</hi> is another grace, the time for the exerciſe, of which is a time of afflictions, and <hi>tryals;</hi> it is a feature in the face of a Child of God hardly diſcernable, but in a day of adverſity, when we fall under ſeverer Providences, then is the time for <hi>Patience to have its perfect work.</hi> If you look upon the Child of God as <hi>lying amongſt the pots,</hi> under the reproach, and obloquy, and rage, and injuries of a vile and wicked generation, who fly at the image of God wherever they ſee it, out of that perfect hatred they have to God, ſo indeed he looks black. But now ſee him under this, owning the righteouſneſs and goodneſs of God, kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Word of God, ſaying concerning his Enemies, <hi>Let them alone, perhaps God hath bidden them curſe,</hi> and will requite me with bleſſing for all the curſings wherewith they have curſed me, or with <hi>Eli,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 18. ſaying; <hi>It is the Lord, let him do unto me what ſeemeth good unto him,</hi> or with <hi>Stephen,</hi> praying for his Enemies, and ſaying, <hi>Father! forgive them! they know not what they do;</hi> ſo he appeareth comely. Look upon the Child of God, under the withdrawings of divine influences from him, when we hear him crying out, <hi>My God, my God! why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> he appeareth to us <hi>black,</hi> but if we ſee him under ſuch withdrawings, reſolving to truſt in God, not to depart from his integrity, nor to forget the Lords precepts, nor deal falſely in his Covenant, but ſtill adhering to God, and his ways, and
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:61084:241"/>
following him with fervent and importunate prayers, ſo again he appeareth <hi>comely.</hi> In ſhort;</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Spouſe of Chriſt is comely in the Eyes of the generality of the Saints, and People of God.</hi> There may be ſome grains of envy, and paſſion in the hearts of the beſt of Gods people, which may cauſe ſome miſinterpretation of their brethren, as <hi>Joſhuah</hi> envied for <hi>Moſes his ſake,</hi> when <hi>Eldad,</hi> and <hi>Medad</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied in the Camp, <hi>Num.</hi> 11. 29. and the Diſciples of <hi>John</hi> were <hi>jealous</hi> for their Maſter; and by <hi>miſtakes</hi> they may be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>black,</hi> as <hi>Hannah</hi> was by <hi>Eli.</hi> But by the generality of the Saints, all ſuch as are partakers of the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> they will be judged <hi>comely,</hi> notwithſtanding their low and afflicted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and notwithſtanding that partial <hi>blackneſs</hi> which appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They are <hi>comely in Chriſts Eyes;</hi> and alas how ſmall a thing to the Child of God is it to be judged of mans judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? <hi>Bernard</hi> thus gloſſeth upon the words; <hi>Nigra veſtro, formoſa Divino Angelicoque judicio,</hi> I am black in your judgment, but fair in the judgment of God, and of the Angels. The Spouſe is black in the Worlds Eyes, but exceeding comely in Chriſts Eyes. The Spouſe ſpeaketh to her beloved, <hi>Can.</hi> 4. 7. <hi>Thou art all fair my love, there is no ſpot in thee.</hi> He replieth to her, <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>How fair is thy love, my Siſter, my Spouſe.</hi> v. 11. <hi>Thy lips (O my Spouſe) drop as the Hony-comb, Hony and Milk are under thy tongue, and the ſmell of thy Garments is like the ſmell of Lebanon.</hi> Would you be confirmed in this, and underſtand whence it is that Chriſt judgeth his Spouſe ſo comely? I will ſhew you in a few particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Becauſe he loveth her.</hi> Love never calleth its object black, but alwaies imprinteth a lovelineſs in its object beloved; the blackeſt woman is fair in her Husbands Eye, love with men co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth a multitude of faults, and infirmities, it overlooks black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and lameneſs, and crookedneſs, and any external deformity, it calleth black things white, crooked things ſtraight, and lame things perfect. Chriſt loves every Spouſe of his with a dear and moſt tender love. But yet this is our infirmity. Chriſt cannot call any <hi>comely,</hi> who indeed is not ſo, the Spouſe muſt be come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, before he can judge, or call her ſo.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Therefore ſhe muſt needs be comely in the</hi> Eyes of Chriſt, becauſe he hath made her ſo, by putting his comelineſs upon her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <hi>Ezek. 16. 14.</hi> Thy beauty was perfect through my comelineſs which I had put upon thee (ſaith the Lord God.) <hi>No Child of God is comely in his or her own comelineſs, but in Chriſts comelineſs put upon him or her. Now this is twofold. 1.</hi> His perfect Righteouſneſs. <hi>2.</hi> His holy and bleſſed Spirit.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>His perfect Righteouſneſs.</hi> Thus the Soul is comely by <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.</hi> All unrighteouſneſs is <hi>blackneſs,</hi> and uncomelineſs in the Eyes of God, for the <hi>righteous Lord loveth righteouſneſs,</hi> and it is impoſſible that the Lord ſhould look upon any Soul as <hi>comely,</hi> but that Soul whom he looketh upon as <hi>righteous.</hi> Chriſt was of old prophecied of, under the <hi>notion</hi> of the <hi>Lord our righteouſneſs,</hi> and the Apoſtle tells us he was made of God, <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Righteouſneſs.</hi> &amp;c. This righteouſneſs of Chriſt lay in his perfect <hi>obedience to the whole law of God,</hi> and his <hi>ſuffering</hi> the curſe of the law due to us for our tranſgreſſion of it; it being the <hi>act</hi> of another, we could not have any intereſt in it, but by a <hi>gracious imputation,</hi> or <hi>reckoning</hi> it to us, and by this gracious act, upon our faith by apprehending it, it becomes ours, ſo we are ſaid to be <hi>juſtified by his faith,</hi> Rom. 5. 1. yet by <hi>his blood,</hi> as <hi>v.</hi> 9, and yet <hi>by grace,</hi> Titus 3. 7. It was an <hi>act of grace</hi> in <hi>God</hi> to accept the performance of another for us, the act and ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſurety, for the ſatisfaction, and acts of the principals, yet a ſatisfaction muſt be given; for God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25. <hi>ſet forth Chriſt as a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteouſneſs for the remiſſion of ſins—That he might be juſt while he became the juſtifier of him that believeth in Jeſus.</hi> So that upon every Souls believing in Jeſus Chriſt, who juſtifies the ungodly. God becomes its <hi>juſtifier,</hi> and the Soul ſtandeth as righteous in the fight of God, through Gods imputation of <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> to it <hi>without works,</hi> and not <hi>imputing ſin</hi> (as the Apoſtle expounds the whole buſineſs of juſtification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 5, 8.) Thus now e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very believing Soul becomes a righteous Soul in the Eye of God, through the righteouſneſs of Chriſt put upon it. This is indeed what ſome modern wits laugh at. But as we ſay in other caſes, let them laugh that win; ſo every ſerious Soul will think it hath cauſe of rejoycing, if it hath thus <hi>won Chriſt</hi> to uſe the Apoſtles expreſſion, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8. which he expoundeth in the very next words. <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>And be found in him, not having my own righteouſneſs which is of the Law, but that which is through the faith of Chriſt, the righteouſneſs which is of God by faith;</hi> and I would have all that love their own Souls, look to be one of that

This is alſo <hi>Chriſts comelineſs, for as the fulneſs of the Godhead dwelt in him bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> ſo himſelf received the Spirit without meaſure that he might meaſure it out by meaſures to his people, and they might <hi>of his fulneſs receive grace for grace.</hi> The holy Spirit is the Spirit of Chriſt, and all its operations are his; Chriſt tells his Spouſe in this <hi>Song</hi> that <hi>ſhe had raviſhed his heart</hi> with the <hi>chains about her neck,</hi> but there is not a jewel in thoſe chains, but cometh out of Chriſts cabinet, he giveth thoſe chains with which himſelf is raviſhed, though theſe divine powers, and habits be his, yet being once given and by us produced into <hi>Acts</hi> they are truely and inherently ours: Our <hi>Faith, Love, Patience, Meekneſs Joy,</hi> &amp;c. Our ſtock of grace upon which our ſouls live, yet not without the daily influence of Chriſt and aſſiſtance of his ſpirit; and this ſtock is capable of aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, or diminution, as it pleaſeth God to let out upon us or to withdraw from us, and as we more or leſs improve it, tho indeed Chriſt hath a conſtant inſpection upon his Spouſes treaſury and will take care that it ſhall never ſo fail, but there ſhall be <hi>a ſeed of God</hi> abiding in the ſoul continually, and the grace of Regeneration in it ſhall be <hi>like a ſpring of water whoſe waters fail not.</hi> This now is the Spouſes real beauty, and comlineſs, which makes her inwardly comely, tho ſhe be externally <hi>black, comely</hi> in Chriſts eyes, and

comely, in the eyes of judicious Chriſtians, tho black in the Worlds eyes who judg from external accidents, or in the eyes of leſs judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Chriſtians, either judging from outward accidents, or particular acts or from ſome corrupt paſſion in themſelves.</p>

I ſay Chriſt judgeth <hi>not from the outward appearance,</hi> man judgeth ſo, but God judgeth <hi>from the heart,</hi> he looketh at the inward man how that is; nor doth he there judg from every <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar motion,</hi> any more then from any <hi>particular act</hi> in our <hi>converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> but from the <hi>ſincerity</hi> and <hi>uprightneſs of the heart.</hi> If <hi>there be a willing mind it is accepted.</hi> The World judgeth from the outward appearance, and indeed that is one diſadvantage with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the World that the ſpouſe of Chriſt is under, ſhe is <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gra extrinſecus, formoſa, intrinſecus.</hi> Black outwardly but comely inwardly. <hi>The Kings Daughter,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt, Pſal.</hi> 45. <hi>is all glorious within.</hi> A good Chriſtian is like a Merchants warehouſe, which is full of rich wares and commodities tho little appeareth without: The hypocrite is l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

World again judgeth of men by ſingle acts, (tho Philoſophy teacheth us, that from them none is to be denominated either vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, or vicious.) God doth not ſo, which is remarkable in the two famous inſtances of <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>David.</hi> Job you know had great fits of impatience, yet ſaith God, <hi>Behold the patience of Job.</hi> David was a man of very great failings; his defiling of <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> his <hi>murder of Uria,</hi> his <hi>numbring of the People,</hi> were three (to name no more) yet God doth not onely mention him, as a man <hi>whoſe heart was perfect,</hi> a <hi>man according to Gods own heart;</hi> But in all the following ſtory of the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Judah</hi> God mentions him as a Pattern, telling us, that ſuch a one did walk according to <hi>David,</hi> or ſuch a one did not do according as <hi>David</hi> had done. The Apoſtle alſo tells us, that we have an <hi>high Prieſt that can have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on our Infirmities,</hi> upon the <hi>ignorant,</hi> and <hi>thoſe that are out of the way.</hi> All which makes it appear that Chriſts judgment of the <hi>Beauty</hi> and <hi>comlineſs</hi> of perſons is not from ſingle acts, but from a conſtant and general courſe of life and converſation. Now every true believer ſets his heart to ſeek the Lord, and to walk before God with a true and perfect heart, and tho he faileth in many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, yet the Lord overlooketh them and judgeth of the Soul, only from its <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>My buſineſs in this exerciſe, is but to apply my laſt diſcourſe. Where, I ſhewed you how, and in what ſenſe the Spouſe of Chriſt is <hi>Black</hi> and yet <hi>comely;</hi> black in her own eyes, in the worlds eyes, and ſomtimes ſo in the eyes of her weaker Brethren, but comely in Chriſts eyes, and in the eyes of her more judicious Brethren.

I come now to apply that diſcourſe; and Firſt,</p>
               <p>We may from hence gather the true notion of a child of God, and underſtand how he ſtands diſtinguiſhed from one that is a <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural man,</hi> and yet an <hi>unbeliever.</hi> The true notion of a child of God is this: He is one who is <hi>imperfectly perfect. Black</hi> but <hi>come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> you ſhall obſerve in Scripture, that <hi>perfection</hi> is both <hi>predicated</hi> and <hi>denied</hi> concerning the People of God; <hi>Not as if I had attained, or were already perfect</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul Phil.</hi> 3. 12. We are commanded to <hi>ſtrive after perfection,</hi> to endeavour to <hi>perfect holineſs</hi> in the <hi>fear of the Lord,</hi> but it is a mark which no man hitteth, Heaven is the only place, <hi>where juſt Souls are made perfect,</hi> both as to their <hi>frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> and as to their <hi>Actions.</hi> A thing is then ſaid to be perfect, and ſo a perſon, when there is nothing wanting to it, or him, nothing that can be added, and in this ſenſe no man can be ſaid to be <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect:</hi> on the other ſide we are not only commanded to ſtudy <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi> but it is ſaid of many in holy Writ that they were <hi>perfect. Noah</hi> was a <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>perfect man</hi> Gen. 6. 9. Job was <hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>upright,</hi> Job 1. 1. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith he <hi>ſpake wiſdom amongſt them that</hi>

                  <hi>are perfect.</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 6. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>Let us as many as be perfect.</hi> A Chriſtian is perfect in the ſame ſenſe that he is <hi>comely.</hi> In ſhort there is a threefold <hi>perfection</hi> may be predicated of a Chriſtian.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>A Perfection of Juſtification.</hi> In this ſenſe every believer is <hi>comely</hi> through Chriſts righteouſneſs put upon him and reckoned to him and he is <hi>perfect,</hi> for the ſtate of juſtification is a ſtate that admits not of degrees, thus we are (as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſions compleat</hi> in Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a <hi>Perfection</hi> of <hi>Regeneration and Sanctification.</hi> this is threefold. 1. <hi>Of degrees;</hi> thus none is perfect, no not one; none liveth and Sinneth not againſt God, there is ſomething to be added to the beſt mans <hi>habits</hi> and Acts of Grace. 2. Of <hi>Parts;</hi> thus again every believer <hi>is perfect,</hi> Sanctified, (as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh) <hi>in body, and mind, and ſpirit,</hi> the man is made a new creature, all the faculties, and powers of his Soul are renewed and Sanctified. 3. Of <hi>ſcope, deſign and intention.</hi> This is <hi>uprightneſs,</hi> this is called <hi>perfectneſs</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God upon the covenant of grace accepteth the Soul upon the account of Chriſt as if it had fulfilled the whole Law of God. Rom. 8. 3, 4. <hi>What the Law could not do, in that it was weak through our fleſh, God ſending his Son in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh and for ſin</hi> (or by a Sacrifice for ſin) <hi>condemned ſin in the fleſh, that the righteouſneſs of the Law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fleſh, but after the Spirit.</hi> God accounteth the righteouſneſs of the Law fulfilled, by thoſe who <hi>walk after the Spirit,</hi> tho per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally it is not, becauſe <hi>Chriſt condemned ſin in the fleſh.</hi> Thus <hi>Noah</hi> is ſaid to be a <hi>perfect man,</hi> Gen. 6. 9. and <hi>Job a perfect man</hi> and <hi>upright;</hi> this is expounded v. 8. <hi>one that feareth God and eſcheweth Evil.</hi> For in the ſtrict ſenſe of <hi>perfection;</hi> Job ſaith chap. 9. v. 20. If <hi>he juſtified himſelf his own mouth ſhould condemn him,</hi> if he ſhould ſay <hi>he were perfect that ſhould prove him perverſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. There is a <hi>comparative perfection</hi> in this ſenſe the Apoſtle ſaith 1 Cor. 3. 6. <hi>That he ſpake wiſdom amongſt them that were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi> and <hi>Phil.</hi> 3 15. <hi>Let us as many as be perfect be thus minded</hi> that is, as many of us as are <hi>comparatively perfect,</hi> whoſe attainments as to <hi>knowledg</hi> and faith are higher than others. The State of the Saints is in no other ſenſe a <hi>State of perfection.</hi> So as I ſay they are imperfectly perfect which is the ſame with that of the Text, <hi>Black</hi> but <hi>comely.</hi> And this ſufficiently diſtinguiſheth the believer from the <hi>unbeliever</hi> whether the <hi>profane perſon</hi> or the <hi>hypocrite.</hi> The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer may ſay <hi>he is black,</hi> but he cannot ſay he is comely. What
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:61084:246"/>
beauty can there be in any Soul not reconciled to God? they are all <hi>blackneſs,</hi> all <hi>deformity.</hi> It is true there is a great deal of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in theſe men, ſome of them are <hi>black</hi> and <hi>filthy</hi> in the eyes of the rational, and more orderly part of the World, ſuch is the <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> the profane <hi>Curſer</hi> and <hi>Swearer,</hi> the <hi>Blaſphemer,</hi> the <hi>Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,</hi> the <hi>Thief,</hi> the <hi>Oppreſſor,</hi> the unrighteous, and intemperate man, theſe are the fots of the Earth, the ſpots of the World, the ſhame, and reproach of the Nation, or City in which they live, Beaſts walking in humane ſhapes. But there are many others who have much beauty in them in the eyes of the World, and humane reaſon, yet are not comely in the eyes of Chriſt. If a man be <hi>Sober,</hi> and <hi>Temperate, Juſt,</hi> and <hi>Righteous, Kind,</hi> and <hi>Charitable,</hi> tho he liveth not up to the ſtrict rule of the Goſpel, and the Commandments of God, yet living up to the conduct of humane reaſon, and the advantages of humane ſociety (which the others infect, and deſtroy) the World counteth him a very good man, full of beauty, and comeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, applaudeth, commends, and courts him. But now the Lord Chriſt, not judging according to the <hi>outward appearance,</hi> but <hi>accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the heart,</hi> ſeeing in this mans heart, no <hi>love of God</hi> conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to theſe acts, nothing of the fear of God awing this mans Soul unto his duty; God I ſay ſeeing him in theſe actions, neither acting from a <hi>perſuaſion</hi> that this is the will of God, nor from a belief of the <hi>Promiſes</hi> or of the <hi>Threatnings,</hi> nor from an <hi>Obedience</hi> to the <hi>Precepts of God,</hi> but meerly from <hi>Politick,</hi> and rational principles, from ſelf ends, &amp; intereſts, that he may appear to men to be good, and ſeeking in theſe actions the <hi>praiſe of men, not of God.</hi> Or meerly under the conduct of reaſon commanding their paſſions, in order to their more comfortable being in this World, and a more <hi>honorable</hi> and acceptable converſe with the beſt men in it.

God who knoweth the heart will much more do ſo.

<pb n="483" facs="tcp:61084:246"/>
of a Soul, not meerly from its external acts, but from that faith in the Precepts, Promiſes, and Threatnings of the Word, from that love, fear, and obedience to God, which ought to have principled thoſe acts, and if they had been ſo, would have made thoſe acts more intenſe, certain, ſteddy, and uniform, if theſe be wanting, the Life-colours are wanting to the Picture. Other things make but up the <hi>Skeleton</hi> of the duty, and are but as a draught of the lines of the Face without the Life-colours which ſeldom have much beauty in them, and the Soul, notwithſtanding all this fair and ſplendid outſide is in his eyes but as a <hi>painted Sepulcher</hi> within which is nothing but a ſtench, and rottenneſs, and the bones of dead men. So that no Soul that is without <hi>Faith,</hi> without the fear and love of God, and that acteth not out of obedience to Chriſt in what it doth, but is black, wholly black in the Lords eyes, how fair ſoever in its own eyes, or the eyes of the men of the world; and what <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaid of old of the beſt, and moſt vertuous actions of the Heathens is true of the beſt actions of theſe titular Chriſtians, they are but <hi>Splendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da Peccata,</hi> Splendid Sinnings. Thus now I ſay the true Chriſtian ſtandeth diſtinguiſhed from unbelievers of all ſizes whatſoever, none of them are comely, but wholly black in the eyes of Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have none of <hi>his comelineſs put upon them.</hi> The glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Saint is altogether whitehe hath not onely waſhed his garments in the Blood of the Lamb, but he is alſo delivered from the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of humane nature, from the Sin that eaſily beſetts him, the weight that preſſeth him down, the war in his members from the luſtings of the fleſh againſt the Spirit, the law of his members ſo often rebelling againſt the law of his mind, and bringing him into a captivity oft times to the law of Sin, and is now preſented be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt <hi>without ſpot or wrinkle.</hi> This is the felicity of his State.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle ſaith that <hi>we are now the Sons of God, but it doth not yet appear what we ſhall be.</hi> Sin here maketh us black, afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſorrow make us appear more <hi>black</hi> then we are, the tranſlat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Soul neither ſinneth nor yet ſuffereth, or ſorroweth any more; the ſtate of the Child of God differeth from theſe, becauſe <hi>he is black,</hi> it differeth from the ſtate of the unbeliever in this life, becauſe he is not onely <hi>black</hi> but alſo <hi>comely;</hi> hence you may underſtand the error of thoſe who <hi>dream</hi> of a <hi>ſtate of perfection</hi> which the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, may and do attain in this life; ſome go very high in blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, telleng us that we are <hi>Chriſted</hi> and <hi>Godded,</hi> and that the believer
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:61084:247"/>
is as ſpotleſs as Chriſt, &amp;c. The Apoſtle indeed tells us, <hi>we are made partakers of the Divine Nature,</hi> but it is one thing to be made partakers of, another thing to be transformed into the <hi>Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> Chriſt is the <hi>chief of ten thouſand, altogether deſires,</hi> there is <hi>no ſpot no blemiſh</hi> in him. The beſt of Gods people is <hi>black</hi> as well as comely; black through inherent corruption, and unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, tho comely in reſpect of <hi>imputed righteouſneſs,</hi> and inherent habits of grace and holineſs. The Apoſtle tells us that, <hi>by one mans diſobedience many were made Sinners,</hi> and that we are all <hi>by nature, children of wrath,</hi> Eph. 2. 3. Thoſe who would have Chriſt to die <hi>for every man,</hi> being pinched with that queſtion, What did Chriſt then purchaſe for thoſe that ſhall never be ſaved? ſome of them anſwer, he purchaſed for all a <hi>totall freedom</hi> from <hi>Adams Sin,</hi> I know no line in Scripture to juſtify that; it was after Chriſt had dyed that the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> tells us we are <hi>all by nature children of wrath,</hi> but he that can fancy that he liveth, and ſinneth not againſt God, and ſo is not black through actual ſin, doth yet more foully deceive himſelf, certainly, he muſt not look into the perfect law of God, or elſe is not able to diſtinguiſh <hi>white</hi> from <hi>black.</hi> If he looked into the divine law he would quickly with Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſee that the law is <hi>Holy,</hi> and <hi>Spiritual,</hi> and <hi>Juſt,</hi> and <hi>Good,</hi> and that the beſt of men is but <hi>carnal ſold under Sin.</hi> Let not then any glory in a fancyed perfection, it is but a glorying in appearance, not in reality. All that the Spouſe gloryeth in is, that ſhe was not altogether black. It is a true ſaying of <hi>Mr. Calvin,</hi> that it is the greateſt piece of our perfection to be ſenſible of our imperfections. As vain is the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying alſo of them who glory in an exemption from afflictions, that this Sun hath not lookt upon them, afflictions have not <hi>ſcorched them,</hi> as they have ſcorched others, the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>that if we be without chaſtening then are we<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Baſtards, and not Sons.</hi> It is not our glory to be free from them, but to <hi>indure them,</hi> not to be wholly exempted from them, but under them to exerciſe our faith and patience, and to <hi>glorify God in the Fires.</hi> The motto of a Child of God is <hi>Black</hi> but <hi>Comely,</hi> black through remaining luſts, and coruptions; comely through <hi>imputed righteouſneſs</hi> and inherent ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits of grace and holineſs. <hi>Black</hi> through <hi>Affliction,</hi> and <hi>Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, Comely</hi> in, and under them, glorifying God in the Fires, by the exerciſes of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Patience.</hi>

For the good that I would I do not, but the evil which I would not that I do; now if I do that which I would not it is no more I that do it, but ſin, that dwelleth in me: I find then a law, that when I would do good, evil is preſent with me, for I delight in the law of God after the inward man.</hi>

Let him Secondly examine himſelf, <hi>whether there be not a comelineſs in him, in, and under his blackneſs of Affliction and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſition.</hi> A wicked man may be black through affliction, but his blackneſs is like the blackneſs of a coal, which is a dead colour and hath no beauty in it. The Child of God is alſo <hi>black</hi> from the ſame cauſe, but his is like the <hi>blackneſs</hi> of a poliſhed marble, which hath a great beauty and comlineſs in it, The trial of his faith in his afflictions appeareth more precious, then that of gold that periſheth, his love to God then appeareth, by his panting after him, and firm adherence of Soul unto him, his meekneſs, his patience, all ſhine forth under his afflictions. The demeanour of People under afflictions, will much diſcover whoſe they are.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, <hi>The comelineſs of the Spouſe of Chriſt is not a comeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs without blackneſs, but a comelineſs norwithſtanding blackneſs:</hi> That is to ſay, <hi>It is not a Native,</hi> but an <hi>adventitious, and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>induced</hi>

So as tho the poor creature hath been guilty before God, and iniquity yet doth ſometimes prevail againſt it, the righteouſneſs of Chriſt being reckoned to him for righteouſneſs, and his heart being renewed, &amp; Sanctified through the Spirit of Chriſt, and the bent of it being ſet right for God, notwithſtanding his blackneſs, the Lord doth judge him comely and beautiful, overlooking his blackneſs by reaſon of ſin, and infirmity.</p>

In ſuch a dark hour as this, it will be a great relief to a Soul to think that the Spouſe of Chriſt is <hi>black,</hi> but <hi>comely.</hi> Doth the Devil then object thy blackneſs, whether by reaſon of paſt, or preſent ſins, in bar to thy truſt and confidence in God, for the forgiveneſs of them through the blood of Chriſt?

               <p n="1">1. It calleth to all the People of God for <hi>humility,</hi> a mean and low opinion of themſelves; beauty is often a great tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>Pride,</hi> whether it be <hi>natural</hi> or <hi>artificial.

<pb n="490" facs="tcp:61084:250"/>
Gods People is neither <hi>natural,</hi> nor any <hi>acqueſt</hi> of their own. There are three things which may keep the moſt comely of Gods Children humble.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>The conſideration of their former blackneſs.</hi> Let but any of them look back to the rock out of which they are hewen, and to the hole of the Pit, out of which they were digged, and they will ſee no reaſon to be exalted above meaſure; their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was a <hi>Syrian,</hi> their birth was of the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> their Father was an <hi>Amorite, their Mother an Hittite,</hi> and in the day wherein they were born, they were caſt out to the loathing of their perſons, not <hi>ſalted,</hi> not <hi>ſwadled</hi> at all. Nor was this all, there is none of them but had their converſation in times paſt, according to the Prince of the power of the Air, <hi>fulfilling the deſires of the fleſh, and of the mind, Children of Wrath by nature.</hi> &amp;c, There is none of them but hath reaſon to pray, that the Lord would not remember the ſins of their youth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, and to beg of God that for them, he would not write againſt them bitter things, nor make them to poſſeſs their <hi>years of vanity.</hi> None of them but before Chriſts comelineſs, was put upon them, had been guilty of ſin enough to make them to walk ſoftly all the days of their lives.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The conſideration of their <hi>preſent blackneſs</hi> is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, though they are <hi>comely,</hi> yet they are <hi>black</hi> ſtill, they have a <hi>body of death,</hi> a <hi>law of their members,</hi> the <hi>luſtings of the fleſh againſt the Spirit,</hi> ſins that eaſily beſet them, weights that often preſs them down; the beauty of the beſt of Gods People is but like the beauty of the <hi>Moon,</hi> which is full of ſpots, hath a dark part, and often ſuffers <hi>great Eclipſes,</hi> and all whoſe light is borrowed. He obſerveth not his own heart that doth not ſee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in the imperfect, and extravagant motions of it, to keep him humble.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The third is the conſideration <hi>from whence he deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth his beauty.</hi> If men and women would but debate a little with their own reaſon, they would ſee no reaſon to be proud of a comelineſs ariſing from any <hi>external Ornament;</hi> it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing beneath a Reaſonable Being, to be beholden to a <hi>Stone</hi> (Jewels are no more) or a <hi>little Earth</hi> (ſuch are Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver) a <hi>Plant,</hi> or a <hi>Fly,</hi> or a <hi>Silkworm,</hi> or a <hi>Sheep<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

comelineſs of a Child of God is a <hi>derived comelineſs.</hi> His <hi>black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> is his own, his <hi>comelineſs</hi> is from <hi>another,</hi> it is Chriſt that hath <hi>made him to differ,</hi> he hath received his beauty, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought not to <hi>glory,</hi> as if he had not received it.</p>

               <p>You ſee here are two <hi>Propoſitions.</hi> 1. Godly Men, and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men will, and ought at ſometimes to acknowledge their corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, blackneſs and infirmities. 2.

The Spouſe doth both in one breath, <hi>I am</hi> (ſaith ſhe) <hi>black,</hi> but <hi>comely.</hi> The handling of this Propoſition will lead me to the diſcourſing of 2 <hi>Queſtions,</hi> or <hi>Caſes</hi> of <hi>Conſcience.</hi> I begin with the firſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> In what caſes, how, and to whom a conſcientious Man or Woman is bound to confeſs his or her ſins?</p>
               <p>Anſ. 1. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon all occaſions, and at all times, he is bound to confeſs all his ſins unto God.</hi> Not that the Divine knowledge can be bette<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by ſuch a confeſſion, for he who knows what things we have need of before we ask them, knoweth what ſins we are guilty of before we confeſs them, but it is a piece of homage we owe unto God, and a duty which his revealed will hath made, and declared a <hi>medium</hi> in order to our obtaining of mercy and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 9. <hi>If we confeſs our ſins, he is faithful and juſt</hi>
                  <pb n="495" facs="tcp:61084:252"/>
                  <hi>to forgive us our ſins.</hi> There was of old a <hi>confeſſion</hi> required be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the bringing of the <hi>Treſpaſs Offering, Num.</hi> 5. 6. Conſonant to this you will find the practice of all the Servants of God. <hi>I ſaid I will confeſs my tranſgreſſions to the Lord, Pſal.</hi> 32. 5. Thus you read of the more publick <hi>Confeſſions</hi> of <hi>Daniel, Ezra, Nehemiah.</hi> This is on all hands granted as a duty out of queſtion, and to be extended to all, and all manner of ſins, eſpecially in <hi>ſecret Prayer,</hi> where no ſins ought to be hidden from the Lord, thoſe we know, and remember ought to be confeſſed more particularly, others more generally.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>There are diverſe caſes wherein a Chriſtian is obliged to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs his ſins unto his Brethren, or to ſuch as God hath ſet over him as his Guides.</hi> They may all be reduced to three heads, Where 1. <hi>The glory of God:</hi> Or, 2. <hi>The good of his neighbour:</hi> Or, 3. <hi>The good, or peace of his own Soul,</hi> may be promoved, or advantaged by ſuch a confeſſion. I will mention 4 more ſpecial caſes, in which all, or ſome of theſe may be concerned.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Where a Chriſtian hath ſtumbled upon the ſame ſtone, and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, and by reaſon of ſuch fall may be under temptations to caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his confidence in God, and deſpair of Divine Mercy.</hi> In ſuch a caſe as this, my Brothers peace and ſpiritual good may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be promoved by telling him, that even alſo my foot ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, but yet through Grace I was recovered. In this ſenſe I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand <hi>David, confeſſing his ſins, Pſal.</hi> 51. 13. and praying for the reſtoring of Gods Salvation. Then (ſaith he) <hi>I will teach tranſgreſſors thy way, and ſinners ſhall be converted unto thee.</hi> I will tell others what a great ſinner I have been, and how, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the multitude, and greatneſs of my ſins, I found favour with thee, and this ſhall incourage them to confeſs their ſins, and humble their Souls before thee, and implore alſo thy mercy and favour. Thus Chriſt bids <hi>Peter,</hi> Luk. 22. 32. <hi>When he was converted, ſtrengthen his Brethren.</hi> When thou art <hi>converted</hi> in that Text, is as much, as when thou art recovered from thy fall, how <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hould he ſtrengthen his Brethren, but by <hi>confeſſing his fall,</hi> and <hi>Gods goodneſs</hi> in recovering him, by telling our Brethren, that our circumſtances were the ſame with theirs, and how the Lord ſhewed us mercy, we both direct them what to do, we help their faith, and confidence in God, and ſtrengthen them in their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes, and applications to the Throne of Grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Where any man diſcerneth that his Brethren are prone to think</hi>
                  <pb n="496" facs="tcp:61084:253"/>
                  <hi>of him above what they ought to think;</hi> this is that which made <hi>Paul</hi> forbear his glorying, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 6. <hi>Leſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>any man ſhould think of me above what he ſeeth me to be,</hi> and doubtleſs, this was that which made that great Apoſtle, though he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times magnified his <hi>Office,</hi> and the <hi>Grace of God</hi> beſtowed upon him, yet alſo ſo oft to vilify himſelf, as 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>Who was before a blaſphemer, a perſecutor, injurious, but obtained mercy, leſs then the leaſt of all Saints,</hi> Eph. 3. 8. <hi>One born out of due time;</hi> doubtleſs this ought to be carefully avoided by us, we ought to take heed, that Gods glory be not given unto us, and his Grace obſcured, or eclipſed, by mens having us in admiration. In ſuch a caſe a true believer will not be aſhamed more then <hi>Paul,</hi> to own his own ſins and blackneſs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third caſe is, <hi>Where a Chriſtian ſeeth, that without bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſcandal upon the Goſpel, he may by owning, and confeſſing his ſins unto men, advance the glory of Gods Free-Grace, and make God to be more admired, and adored in the emanations of it.</hi> Free-Grace is that which hath made the Child of God what he is, and is therefore the admirable object in the believers Eye, and where a Chriſtian ſeeth an opportunity to predicate that, and advance it in the Eyes of any, he will not loſe it, nor ſtick at the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and diſhonouring himſelf, ſo God may have his glory from that ſhaming of himſelf. Now becauſe Free-Grace is never more magnified, then when a multitude of ſins are forgiven, and a great ſinner is received to favour, a good Chriſtian (ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving circumſtances) where they will fit this end, will not ſpare this acknowledgment, though it tendeth to his own ſhame, and diſhonour. So that God may be glorified, he is content to take ſhame to himſelf. I ſay <hi>obſerving circumſtances,</hi> and indeed the chief circumſtance to be obſerved, is the <hi>reputation of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi> He will therefore decline it in the preſence of profane and ungodly men, who would make an ill uſe of ſuch diſcourſe, to blaſpheme the good, and holy ways of God. Thus <hi>David</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frained from <hi>good talk whiles the wicked were in ſight,</hi> Pſa. 39. <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2. <hi>Confeſſion of our ſins one to another called for,</hi> Jam. 5. 16, 17. <hi>is one of thoſe holy things which muſt not be caſt before Dogs,</hi> one of thoſe <hi>Pearls,</hi> which muſt not be thrown <hi>before Swine.</hi> Thus you ſhall obſerve in St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that in that part of his Epiſtles, where he writeth with reference to the Saints, he openeth himſelf, and layeth himſelf naked, but where he ſpeaketh of himſelf with
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:61084:253"/>
relation to the falſe Apoſtles, there he <hi>magnifieth his Office.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">
                  <hi>4. A fourth caſe is,</hi> where a Child of God can probably judge, that by his confeſſion of his ſin, and owning of his blackneſs before men, he may be advantaged by their counſels, or by their prayers. <hi>There are two ways by which a Chriſtian may be advantaged by</hi> the confeſſion of his ſins unto men. <hi>1.</hi> With reſpect to the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his pardon. <hi>2.</hi> With reſpect to his peace, or the obtaining a ſenſe of his pardon.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>I ſay with reſpect to his obtaining pardon.</hi> Not that it is in the power of man to pardon ſin, he only can diſcharge a debt, to whom it is owing. Sin is a debt to the juſtice of God, and who but God can remit this debt? It is not in the power of <hi>Pope,</hi> or <hi>Prieſt,</hi> or <hi>Miniſter,</hi> to pardon ſins, or grant abſolution to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but <hi>declaratively,</hi> he can indeed declare the will of God, to pardon the ſins of thoſe that truly <hi>repent,</hi> and <hi>believe</hi> in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but that is all the Miniſter can do in the remiſſion of ſin, the Act is Gods, the Miniſters <hi>abſolution</hi> is valid or inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid as the Perſon doth, or doth not truly repent, and truly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. But yet I ſay the <hi>confeſſion of ſins,</hi> not only to <hi>Miniſters,</hi> but to <hi>private Chriſtians,</hi> may be of great uſe and effect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the obtaining of our pardon, by vertue of that promiſe, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 16. <hi>If a man ſee his Brother ſin a ſin, which is not unto death, he ſhall ask, and give him life who hath not ſinned unto death.</hi> Now unleſs we know that our Brother hath ſinned, how ſhall we ask for him, and unleſs we have ſeen him, how ſhall we know it, without his own confeſſion of it us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But ſecondly, <hi>It muſt alſo be of great advantage to us with reſpect to our peace, or ſenſe of pardon,</hi> and that is not only (as the other) by obtaining their prayers for us, but alſo by obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their advice and counſel, thus oft-times a Chriſtians own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and confeſſing ſome particular ſins, either to a judicious and faithful Miniſter, or to ſome judicious, and well experienced Chriſtians, proveth a great eaſe, and relief to his mind, by their ſpeaking of ſome word in ſeaſon, or by ſome ſeaſonable advice, and counſel. Now in ſuch a caſe as this a Chriſtian may be under the ſame obligation to confeſs his ſins unto men, that every one is to do what is of moſt proper Spiritual advantage to his Soul.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3. Laſtly.</hi> There are ſome caſes wherein a Child of God will own his blackneſs even b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fore the world.</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>When he cannot conceal it without denying the truth.</hi> A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is not bound to proclaim his Sin to the men of the world
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:61084:254"/>
when it may tend to the reproach, and blaſpheming of the name of God, but if the caſe be ſo, that he hath failed in their ſight, and they come to the knowledge of it, and charge him with it, they muſt not tell a lie to cover their own ſhame. When <hi>Tamar, Gen.</hi> 38. 25. ſent to her Father in law <hi>the Signet, and Bracelets, and Staff,</hi> with that meſſage. <hi>By the man whoſe theſe are I am with Child. Diſcern I pray thee, whoſe are th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. When <hi>the ſin is known, and is an eminent injury to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</hi> In caſe of all injuries to men, which are capable of <hi>repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and ſatisfaction, ſatisfaction is neceſſary</hi> in order to Gods pardon, if we be able to make it, but not <hi>confeſſion</hi> in all caſes. As now ſuppoſe a Servant hath ſtolen from his Maſter, during his ſervice with him, and his Maſter be one that is an Enemy to Religion, and Godlineſs; afterwards God changeth this Servants heart, he is certainly bound to his ability to make his Maſter reparation, &amp; full ſatisfaction, but I do not know that he is bound to come to confeſs it unto him, who probably would make no other uſe of it, then to reproach, and blaſpheme the name of God, and that way, and courſe of Religion, in which he is inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. But in caſe the thing be known, then confeſſion even to man may be our duty, to take ſhame to our own Souls, and give glory unto God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Laſtly, <hi>a Child of God will confeſs his ſin even before Men of the World, where he ſees a probable opportunity to do other ſinners good by it.</hi> And this moſt <hi>commonly</hi> happeneth when men have been companions in ſin, one to, and with another. When men have been companions one to another, in <hi>Drunkenneſs, Theſe, Sabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breaking,</hi> or any other courſe of ſinning. A good man may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times probably judge that his owni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>g and confeſſing with tears, to his old Companions, his fellowſhip with them in ſinning, may probably invite them to a fellowſhip with him, in a conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his or their ways, in a ſenſe of, and godly ſorrow for their ſins, and if he hath any ſuch hopes, any ſuch proſpect, he will confeſs his blackneſs even to them. Thus I find ſome Divines in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting that, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 15. <hi>Confeſs your ſins one to another.</hi> That thoſe who have been colleagues, and companions in ſin one to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, ſhould confeſs and bewail their ſins each to other, tho I muſt confeſs I rather think that Text is to be underſtood of <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate, ſerious</hi> Chriſtians, confeſſing their ſins freely one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in order to the obtaining of the benefit of each others
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:61084:254"/>
prayers, becauſe of what follows, <hi>And pray one for another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe now are thoſe caſes and times, in and under which, the Spouſe of Chriſt will confeſs and acknowledge that ſhe is <hi>black,</hi> black through the prevailings of ſin and corruption.</p>
               <p>Of this <hi>Confeſſion of ſins</hi> we have plentiful inſtances in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, both of ſuch as were more <hi>publick,</hi> and ſuch as were more <hi>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ivate;</hi> it is brought as one argument to prove the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to be no humane Writings, but the Word of God, and that holy men wrote, as they were inſpired by God, that they have publiſhed their own <hi>failings,</hi> and made their own ſins to ſtand upon Record to Poſterity, which is not the way of ordinary Writers, who commonly write for their own honour and praiſe. Beſides the Scripture inſtances, we have it in the daily practice of Gods people, not only in their dayly prayers they put up to Almighty God; but in their more private converſes, with Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and with fellow Chriſtians, which are very full of theſe confeſſions, and abaſements of themſelves.</p>
               <p>This freedom of Gods People in owning, and acknowledging their blackneſs, proceedeth from ſeveral cauſes. 1. The Souls <hi>humiliation before it be brought home to Chriſt.</hi> The Soul being enlightned by the Spirit of Grace, ſeeth the <hi>vileneſs,</hi> and <hi>filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of its own heart to that degree, that it is aſhamed, and thinks that it cannot abaſe itſelf enough in the ſight of God, and from this diſpoſition of the Soul to abhor, loath, and ſhame it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, proceedeth this freedom, &amp; willingneſs in the Soul upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions (with reſpect had to Chriſtian prudence) to vilify it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by the confeſſion of its own blackneſs and infirmity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It proceedeth alſo from the <hi>habit of humility</hi> given to, and wrought in the heart of every believer; this is one of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the new Creature, it differeth from the other little more then as the <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſpoſition</hi> from the <hi>habit.</hi> This teacheth the Soul at all times a mean and low opinion of itſelf. The Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite is alwaies proud, and looks upon all his gifts, and good actions with a multiplying glaſs, which makes them appear more then they are, and greater then they are. The humble Soul looks upon all as leſs. In me (ſaith <hi>Paul)</hi> there dwelleth no good thing? Hence he can hardly be heard to ſay any thing but in diminution, and defamation of himſelf.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It proceeds alſo <hi>from this Souls more perfect underſtanding the mark of perfection.</hi> He knoweth better then another, what God requires of him, what degrees of faith, love, zeal, holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:61084:255"/>
this makes him a better judge of his own imperfections, and more ready to confeſs, and bewail them. The Hypocrite and natural man underſtandeth not the breadth of the Divine Law, what <hi>faith,</hi> what <hi>holineſs</hi> God requireth of him, he is <hi>proud, knowing nothing</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks of ſome, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 4.) not only his <hi>Pride,</hi> prompting him to exalt himſelf, but his ignorance, knowing nothing as he ought to know it, is the cauſe of his want of freedom to this duty. It is with ſuch a man, as it is with a <hi>Sophiſter</hi> in the Univerſity. A little knowledge that he hath, puffeth him up; he thinks he knows all things. But when he comes to be <hi>Maſter of Arts,</hi> to have lookt into Books a little more, and to underſtand the compaſs of learning a little better, then he complains of his ignorance, and the ſmall portion of knowledge which he hath. So the man that hath but a mean and imperfect knowledge of the will of God, he is proud, and thinketh he knoweth all things; but when God comes to open his Eyes, and to let him ſee the myſteries of Divine knowledge, he ſeeth more duty then he ſaw before, and conſequently more ſin, and more defects in his own Soul: There is a vaſt difference betwixt that knowledge of <hi>duty</hi> &amp; ſin, which is in the heart of a Child of God under the illumination of the Spirit of Grace, and that which is in a Soul not under that ſpecial illumination.</p>

As we know of no Satisfaction to be given for ſin, but what is given by the death of Chriſt (excepting only in caſes of wrong done unto men capable of reparation;) Nor of any power in any to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give ſins but only in God, only the Miniſter may declare what God hath done or will do in cafe of our true repentance and faith: ſo we know of no incumbent duty upon any Chriſtian to make a particular confeſſion of ſin to the Prieſt, and only judge ſuch <hi>particular confeſſion</hi> neceſſary in ſome particular caſes, for the diſburthening, and eaſing of Chriſtians conſciences, preſſed under the guilt of ſome particular ſins, and in ſuch a caſe an able and faithful Miniſter of Chriſt is doubtleſs the moſt proper Perſon to make confeſſion to, both becauſe as by his <hi>office</hi> he is both an Interpreter of the mind, and will of God, and to <hi>pray</hi> for the <hi>People,</hi> ſo he is or ought <hi>to be one of a thouſand,</hi> like <hi>Saul,</hi> taller then his Brethren by the head, and ſhoulders in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge &amp; gifts of greater knowledge &amp; judgment in the things of God, and ſo more able to miniſter a word in ſeaſon. It is ſad that it cannot be ſaid of all, they are ſo, but it is to be preſumed, that the ſame wiſdom which teacheth every man and woman, to commit the buſineſs of his bodily health, to the ableſt &amp; moſt faithful Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian he can chuſe, and the concern of his Eſtate, to the moſt able &amp; faithful Lawyer he can, will alſo direct a Chriſtian to commit the far more weighty concerns of his Soul, to the moſt able and faithfull Miniſter that he can; nor ought any Chriſtian to be more abridged in his liberty with reference to the latter of far more concernment, then with referenceto the former of far more minute concernment to him, But I ſay a good Chriſtian having made choice of ſuch a Perſon he is undoubtedly the fitteſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to confeſs our ſins unto, when they lye heavy upon our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and we cannot recover our Peace, and that with reſpect to both the ends of ſuch confeſſion, whether <hi>Prayers for us or Counſel</hi> and <hi>advice,</hi> and that both with reſpect to the <hi>abilityes of</hi>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Chriſtians ought to uſe ſo much wiſdom as may protect their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion from reproach and ſcandal,</hi> &amp; which may prejudice the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, yet whatſoever prudence we can uſe to prevent any thing of this nature, is doubtleſs our duty. This evil ariſeth from the needleſs publication of the ſinful fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of profeſſors. He that hath <hi>ſinned openly,</hi> ought to be <hi>rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked openly,</hi> and openly to <hi>confeſs his ſin,</hi> that the Church of God offended by his fall, may be ſatisfied in the truth of his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and recovery out of the ſnare of the Devil, but where the ſin is of another nature, and hath been committed ſecretly, there is not only no need of ſuch a publick confeſſion, but it may be of a greater miſchief, and ill conſequence, then good, by reaſon of a wicked world, which watcheth for Gods Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples haltings, to reproach profeſſion, and the holy name of God. Though therefore in ſuch caſes <hi>private Confeſſion,</hi> even of more private ſins, may be neceſſary and expedient, yet it ought to be managed with prudence, as to the manner, that is, in the beſt conſiſtency with the end to which it is directed, and for the avoiding ſuch things as may tend to the diſhonour of God, and diſadvantage of the more publick intereſt and cauſe of God, and therefore much wiſdom is to be uſed in the choice of a friend in this caſe, for though <hi>Solomon</hi> hath adviſed us, <hi>Pro.</hi> 25. 9

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. I ſay, firſt, <hi>Silence and Secrecy.</hi> Your ordinary experience telleth you, that even amongſt good men, ſome have a much better command, and government of their tongue then others, and as it is obſervable that ſuch fall into more errors themſelves, then others, for in a multitude of words there wanteth not ſin; ſo ſuch perſons are leaſt to be truſted with the Secrets of Souls.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

               <p n="3">3. If this <hi>Confeſſion</hi> be made in order to obtaining the <hi>benefit of prayers,</hi> the ſame wiſdom will direct us to make choice of ſuch as we can reaſonably judge to be perſons likely to prevail with God in prayer; there are ſome that are more <hi>mighty in the Scriptures,</hi> more <hi>exerciſed</hi> in the ways of God then others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> theſe are moſt fit for <hi>advice,</hi> and <hi>counſel.</hi> There are ſome that are more exerciſed in prayer then others, and more prevailing with God, theſe are fitteſt to hear our Confeſſions in order to our advantage by their prayers, and theſe generally are ſuch as walk moſt uprightly, and cloſely with God.

to be ſhewed <hi>in the manner of the doing of it.</hi> That which of <hi>charity</hi> is to be ſhewen in it, is to do it <hi>where the Soul</hi> of our <hi>Brother may be advantaged by the performance of it.</hi> That of <hi>pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> which is to be ſhewed in its Eyes,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>In a right ſixing of our end, which ought to be the glory of God,</hi> the general end of all our actions. When <hi>Joſhua</hi> exhorted <hi>Achan to confeſs his ſin. My Son</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>confeſs, and give glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unto God;</hi> you read in Scripture of a <hi>confeſſion</hi> of the <hi>Lords name, a confeſſion of truth, and a confeſſion of ſin.</hi> The glory of God is the end of all (that is the praedication of his glory, for that is all the way we have to glorify God.) A man by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of his ſins, either unto God, or men, may give glory to God, for in confeffing himſelf a ſinner, he owned the <hi>Lords Power, and Soveraignty</hi> over him, the <hi>Holineſs,</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of his <hi>Law,</hi> and his <hi>patience, long-ſuffering,</hi> and goodneſs, that he is not cut off, and thrown into Hell, and indeed there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of ſin our duty, where this end cannot be attained ſome way or other, God doth not delight in the ſhame, and confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our faces, but he doth delight in the exalting of his own name, and in the praedication of his own praiſe and glory.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, <hi>Piety</hi> is concerned in the <hi>manner of the action.</hi> So it muſt be doṅe with tenderneſs of heart, <hi>brokenneſs,</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition of Spirit;</hi> indeed without this, the <hi>enumeration,</hi> and <hi>recital</hi> of our <hi>ſins</hi> is but either a <hi>glorying in ſin,</hi> or at beſt but a <hi>formalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and <hi>ſhell of duty.</hi> A glorying in ſin, is but a glorying in our ſhame, and what will be far from the Soul of a Child of God. A <hi>formality of duty</hi> is but hypocriſy. It is a great vanity for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Soul to think, that God ſhould be pleaſed with a meer emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty noiſe of words, which are not expreſſive of any inward diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the heart, in which he hath declared himſelf pleas'd. Words in prayer, and confeſſion of ſins, are our duty, but they muſt be ſuch words as are thruſt out of our lips, by the force of the inward affections of our hearts. If a man confeſſeth his ſin unto God, either publickly or privately, this is requiſite. Therefore you ſhall obſerve that the main thing which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, is our <hi>humbling our ſelves;</hi> that ſignifieth the affection of the heart. A man cannot humble himſelf by the words of his lips, without the inward ſhame, and brokenneſs of his Soul. The ſame thing is neceſſary in our <hi>confeſſions</hi> unto men. Under the old law there was <hi>Oyl, and Frankincenſe</hi> to be poured upon
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:61084:258"/>
the <hi>Meat Offering</hi> Lev. 2. 2. and ſeveral other Offerings as you will read in that Book, but upon the <hi>Sin</hi> Offering there was no <hi>Oyl</hi> nor <hi>Frankincenſe,</hi> to be put, <hi>Lev.</hi> 5. 11. Oyl ſignified <hi>Glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> hence you read that they uſed it when they would <hi>make their Face to Shine;</hi> and you read of the <hi>Oyl of Gladneſs;</hi> the Confeſſion of Sin under the Goſpel is a <hi>Sin Offering to God,</hi> and muſt not be offered, without a ſutable ſenſe and Sorrow of Heart. This is a requiſite in all Confeſſions of Sin.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, We ought with the acknowledgment <hi>of our Blackneſs,</hi> whether to God, or Man, to join alſo the acknowledgment of our <hi>Comelineſs,</hi> ſo far as God hath made any diſcovery of it to our Souls: we ought not indeed, to Glory beyond our line and meaſure, but we ought not to conceal what God hath done for our Souls. In this both the Glory and Honour of God, and the good, and incouragement of our dejected and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolate Brethren are both concerned; nor can we imagine, that we ſhould be more concerned, to diſcover our own vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and naughtineſs, then Gods Grace and Mercy.

But of this there is no queſtion, neither is this the acknowledgment of the Text, ſhe is here ſpeaking not unto God, but to the Daughters of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> It is our duty alſo in ſome caſes to own our <hi>Comelineſs</hi> through grace unto men.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To <hi>the Church of Chriſt,</hi> and to <hi>particular Chriſtians.</hi> 1. <hi>To the Church,</hi> and that in two caſes. 1. <hi>Upon our Admiſſion</hi> into it. 2. Upon our <hi>Re-admiſſion,</hi> and <hi>reſtoring to the Priviledges of it.</hi> We find in the firſt Plantation of Churches of the Goſpel, there was ordinarily ſuch a <hi>confeſſion</hi> and <hi>acknowledgment.</hi> It is ſaid <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. That thoſe who were Baptized of <hi>John</hi> were Baptized in <hi>Jordan, confeſſing their Sins,</hi> Matth. 3. 6. After Chriſts Aſcenſion into Heaven, we read of the <hi>three thouſand Souls,</hi> added to the Church, that they were firſt <hi>pricked at the Heart,</hi> and ſaid to <hi>Peter</hi> and to <hi>the reſt of the Apoſtles, Men</hi> and <hi>Brethren, what ſhall we do?</hi> and in <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 36. when the <hi>Eunuch</hi> ſaid to <hi>Philip, Here is Water, what doth hinder me to be baptized? Philip anſwereth, if thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveſt with all thine heart thou maieſt,</hi> and <hi>he anſwered, and ſaid, I believe that Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God.</hi> In thoſe firſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions into the <hi>Goſpel Church,</hi> it is plain, that <hi>Confeſſion of Sin,</hi> and Profeſſion of a <hi>Faith in Chriſt,</hi> were required as neceſſary, and previous to <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> by which Perſons were admitted into a fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:61084:259"/>
with the Church of God. But altho the firſt admiſſion into Goſpel Churches were only of <hi>Grown Perſons,</hi> able to make Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of their Sins, and a Profeſſion of their faith in Chriſt, which were alwaies done upon ſuch admiſſions: yet the <hi>Children</hi> of ſuch perſons ſo <hi>Baptized</hi> have been alwaies taken to be within the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> and ſo <hi>Members of the Church</hi> alſo, but whether compleat Members or no, hath been a queſtion, and indeed generally denied, and ſomething further required of them before they have been taken into a full Communion with the Church in the <hi>Ordinance of the Supper.</hi> For that being an Ordinance of the Goſpel, which is a <hi>Seal of the Righteouſneſs of Faith</hi> (as was ſaid of <hi>Circumciſion</hi> with reference to <hi>Abraham, Rom.</hi> 4. 11.) It is but reaſonable to conclude that none have a right unto it but ſuch as are made <hi>Partakers</hi> of <hi>that Righteouſneſs of Faith,</hi> thoſe that by an eye of Faith can diſcern the Lords Body, by an hand of Faith lay hold upon Chriſt under thoſe ſenſible ſigns, and repreſentations, and that by Faith can Eat the Fleſh and Drink the Blood of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, while with the Mouths of their Bodies they Eat the Bread and Drink the Wine. Hence the Apoſtle commands us to examine our ſelves and <hi>ſo to Eat of that Bread, and Drink of that Cup,</hi> and telleth us that <hi>whoſo Earteth the Fleſh and Drinketh the Blood of the Lord unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Eateth and Drinketh Judgment unto himſelf:</hi> and hence it is that ſome evidence both of <hi>Knowledg,</hi> and <hi>Regeneration</hi> is judged neceſſary to ſuch as have a full Communion in this Ordinance with the Church of Chriſt. The beſt evidence whereof is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly an holy converſation; That a <hi>verbal declaration</hi> in this caſe is abſolutely neceſſary, I cannot ſay, which may be made in hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, and it made ſignifies nothing, if not confirmed by an holy Life; where it can be made in truth, and with freedom of Spirit it is doubtleſs exceeding ſatisfactory, both to the Miniſters of Chriſt, who are <hi>Stewards of the Miniſtries of God, of whom it is required that they ſhould be faithful,</hi> (diſtributing their Maſters goods according to their Maſters order) and to the Members of the Church with which they are joined. But I by no means think that it ought to be inſiſted on, as to many Chriſtians who may be under fears, and doubts, and deſpondencies, but evidence the change of their hearts by a holineſs of life. Thus far I have a little digreſſed to give you my judgment in this point. By which you may ſe how little the difference in this caſe is betwixt Brethren, would they calmly liſten to hear and to underſtand one another and not judge each other not heard.</p>

2. <hi>Upon our re-admiſſion, or reſtoring to the Church of God.</hi> The judicial ſeparation of Scandalous perſons from the Church, is a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient evidence, that no perſons unholy in their lives ought to be admitted into a communion with it, and that they are no more then preſumptive members of it, or if you will, <hi>viſible members,</hi> that is, ſuch as in outward appearance are ſo, but when by any open action, they diſcover the contrary, they ought to be ſeparated from it, and not reſtored without <hi>repentance,</hi> of which <hi>repentance</hi> indeed, (it being the change of the heart) we are no <hi>infallible judges,</hi> having no rule of judgment, but being forced to truſt to the <hi>ſincerity of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,</hi> joined with a <hi>viſibly reformed Converſation.</hi> The Church of Chriſt in all ages, ſo far as we may truſt any account we have had of it, hath required both. 1. A <hi>verbal declaration,</hi> of what God hath done for the offending party, working in him or her a <hi>Godly ſhame and ſorrow,</hi> and beſides this the <hi>evidence of a reformed life,</hi> to which purpoſe, there was a great ſeverity uſed in the Primitive Church, in caſe of perſons lapſed before they would again receive them into a full communion with them, they would in the caſe of ſome Sins have the evidence of a changed heart, from a reformed Life. For 3, 5, 7, 10, 20. Years according to the degree of the Scandal and Offence. Indeed in latter Ages, as <hi>Popery</hi> prevailed upon the World, this diſcipline degenerated into a ſtrange for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality of <hi>auricular Confeſſion,</hi> ſetting <hi>penances,</hi> and a preſent <hi>abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> without any thing more then a perfunctory verbal confeſſion. But <hi>from the beginning it was not ſo,</hi> neither ought to be ſo now. When any perſon, by any <hi>apoſtacy</hi> or <hi>lapſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> declareth, (ſo far as the Church can judge) either that at firſt he was no true member of the Church, (however by an error admitted to it) or that at leaſt the Church hath no reaſon to judge otherwiſe ſo as he be ſeparated from its Communion, he ought not to be reſtored without ſuch an evidence as may ſatisfy the Church, that he is one fit to be in full Communion with it, and this evidence can be no other way, then by a <hi>verball declaration,</hi> or by an <hi>holy and reformed converſation.</hi> I think it ought to be by both. Thus, St <hi>Paul</hi> in the caſe of the <hi>inceſtuous Perſon,</hi> whom he had ordered to be caſt out of the Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. ordereth the <hi>reſtoring of him,</hi> but not till he had eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his <hi>ſorrow,</hi> and that to ſuch a degree, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> was afraid he <hi>ſhould be ſwallowed</hi> up with <hi>over much ſorrow.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2, 7. &amp; v. 11. <hi>Leſt Satan ſhould get an advantage.</hi> Theſe are the two caſes in which I conceive <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ought to make no difficulty to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:61084:260"/>
their Spiritual <hi>Comelineſs</hi> to the <hi>Church of God,</hi> of which they are Members. I have been a little larger in ſpeaking to them, in regard of the queſtions which have ariſen in theſe times, that I might tell you my judgment as to them, and do what in me lyes to the healing of breaches amongſt Brethren, with reference to them, that if poſſible we might rightly underſtand one another, and recover the Unity of the Spirit in the bond of Peace.</p>
               <p>But beſides this more open acknowledgment of what God hath done for us, in order to our more comfortable Communion with the Church of Chriſt, &amp; participation of all Ordinances of the Goſpel with them: I do conceive there are alſo ſome caſes wherein ſuch a <hi>Declaration,</hi> or owning of what God hath done for us, to particular Chriſtians is our duty: and that,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>In caſe of ſome particular Scandal.</hi> Suppoſe a Chriſtian hath taken ſome particular offence, at ſome <hi>Scandalous</hi> actions or behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of mine, before God wrought a <hi>change in my Heart</hi> or after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and can hardly be ſatisfied that I am now a diſciple, but is afraid of fellowſhip and communion with me in this caſe, it is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs my duty if I know of it, to ſatisfy him, by declaring to him, what God hath ſince that time done for my Soul. Thus you read of <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts 9. 26. <hi>Paul</hi> you know was a <hi>Perſecutor,</hi> in the beginning of that Chapter, you read of his Fury againſt the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi> when he came to <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> v. 26. <hi>he eſſaied to join him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Diſciples,</hi> but, <hi>they were all afraid of him, and believed not that he was a Diſciple,</hi> v. 27. Barnabas <hi>took him,</hi> and <hi>brought him to the Apoſtles,</hi> and <hi>declared how he had ſeen the Lord in the way, and how he had ſpoken to him. Paul</hi> had declared it to <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas,</hi> and doubtleſs (tho it be not recorded) made a follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Declaration himſelf. Certainly of this there can be no doubt what ever the Scandal be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But Secondly,</hi> Certainly it is our duty ſo often, and in any caſe, as and where we can probably judge that ſuch a Declaration may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the Glory of God, or to the good of other Souls, either in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to God, or exciting them to bleſs God on our behalf, or to truſt in God and in Chriſt by our example. <hi>The relating, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring, and telling abroad Gods Wondrous Works is one way by which we Praiſe and Glorify God, as appears in all the Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings, and Songs of Praiſe, which we find in holy Writ, now certainly the Declaration of Gods wonderful Works in the Soul is of a high, and great concern to the Glory of God, as his wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>
                  <pb n="512" facs="tcp:61084:261"/>
                  <hi>works of common Providence in the World, and ought no more to be concealed, nor ſhall we find in holy Writ that they were.</hi> Come <hi>(ſaith David) and I will</hi> tell you what God hath done for my Soul, <hi>Pſal. 66. 16, 17.</hi> I cryed unto him with my mouth, <hi>and</hi> he was extolled with my tongue. <hi>And poſſibly you ſhall find the book of</hi> Pſalms <hi>as full of expreſſions of this, as any other nature. How free in this caſe is</hi> Paul? I live <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me, and the Life which I now live in the fleſh, I live by the faith of the Son of God, <hi>1. Cor. 15. 9, 10.</hi> I am the leaſt of the Apoſtles, that am not meet to be called an Apoſtle, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I perſecuted the Church of God. But by the grace of God, I am what I am, and his grace which was beſtowed on me was not in vain, But I laboured more abundantly then they all, yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me. <hi>So,</hi> Tim. <hi>1. 13.</hi> Who was before a Blaſphemer a perſecutor, injurious. <hi>But</hi> I obtained mercy—<hi>v. 14.</hi> And the grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, was exceeding abundant by ſaith in Lovewhich is in Chriſt Jeſus. <hi>So in many other texts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3. Laſtly, There is a time when a Chriſtian will be obliged to</hi> acknowledge his grace, and Spiritual comelineſs before the men of the World. <hi>That is,</hi> when the World ſcandalizeth his profeſſion. <hi>This Interpreters judge was the caſe here, the daughters of</hi> Hieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem <hi>reproached the Spouſe for her</hi> blackneſs. <hi>Thus Saint</hi> Paul, <hi>then whom none ever ſpake in a more</hi> vilifying dialect <hi>then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of himſelf, yet at other times he</hi> magnified his Office, <hi>2 Cor. 12. 11.</hi> I am <hi>(ſaith he) become a</hi> fool in glorying, you have compelled me, for I ought to have been commended by you, for in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing am I behind the chiefeſt of the Apoſtles, tho I be nothing, Truly the ſigns of an Apoſtle were wrought amongſt you in all pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in ſigns, and wonders, and mighty deeds. <hi>So 2 Cor. 11. 25.</hi> For I ſuppoſe I was not a whit behind the chieſeſt of the Apoſtles, but though I be rude in Speech, yet not in knowledge, but we have been throughly made manifeſt firſt amongſt you in all things. <hi>When the</hi> Corinthians <hi>ſought a</hi> proof of Chriſt in him, <hi>2 Cor. 13. 3. he tells them v. 4.</hi> For we are alſo weak in him, but we ſhall live with him, by the power of God towards you, <hi>v. 6.</hi> I truſt you ſhall know that we are no reprobates.</p>
               <p>From this diſcourſe may eaſily be gathered the reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this duty. There are four things that call to us for it, and make it our duty.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt is the <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>glory of God.</hi> This is the great end of all our actions, for this cauſe we were born, for this cauſe
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:61084:261"/>
we came into the World, I have before told you, that we have no other way to glorify God but by the predication, or ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his <hi>greatneſs,</hi> or <hi>goodneſs,</hi> or ſome other of his attributes, and by our <hi>holy life and converſation in obedience to his will:</hi> Now of all Gods attributes, there is none wherein he more delighteth then in ſhewing mercy, and whoſo tells of Gods acts of grace doth eminently glorify God, for the riches of his grace and goodneſs, are diſcovered in Chriſt, and as in his giving of Chriſt for poor loſt ſinners, ſo in the application of that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed redemption to the Souls of his poor creatures. <hi>Bleſs the Lord! O my Soul</hi> (ſaith <hi>David)</hi> Pſal. 103. <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2, 3. <hi>and all that is within me bleſs his holy name. Bleſsthe Lord, O my Soul, &amp; forget not all his benefits, who forgiveth all thy iniquities &amp; healeth all thy diſeaſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Second reaſon is the <hi>good of our Brother.</hi> Next <hi>our immediate magnifying and glorifying of God</hi> there is nothing more our duty, then the conſulting the good of our Brethren, and he is highly ſerviceable to God, who is any way ſerviceable to the Souls of others, either in winning them to God, or advantaging them in their walking with God. The Souls of Chriſtians have often great advantages by hearing what God hath done for the Souls of others in their circumſtances. It incourageth them to make their applications to God, to hope, and truſt in his mercy to wait untill he will be pleaſed in like manner to be gracious to them. <hi>David Pſal.</hi> 69. 32. makes this as an argument, with which he pleadeth with God for mercy for his Soul. He promiſeth firſt, <hi>v.</hi> 30. <hi>That he would praiſe the Lord with a ſong and magnify him with thanksgiving.</hi> then he addeth <hi>v.</hi> 32. <hi>The humble ſhall ſee this, and be gladand your hearts ſhall live that ſeek God, for the Lord heareth the poor, and deſpiſeth not his Priſoners.</hi> By the humble is to be underſtood (as in many other Texts of Scripture) Perſons in low, mean and afflicted conditions. It much conduceth to the raiſing up of the Spirits of a man, under torments of bodily pain and affliction, if one comes and tells him, I was in the ſame condition, and had the ſame pain, yet I by ſuch and ſuch applications recovered, and it is of no leſs uſefulneſs, to one of a poor, and broken Spirit, for one to come to him, under his doubts and fears, and deſpondency becauſe of the guilt of ſin, when another Chriſtian comes to him, and tells him, I alſo was a blaſphemer, a drunkard, an injurious Perſon, yet I obtained mercy. I bleſs God my doubts are reſolved, my fears ſcattered, and I am inabled through grace to hope in the
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:61084:262"/>
                  <hi>frèe gerace</hi> and mercy of God through the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Wher now ſuch an opportunity as this is (which is not very frequent) there the good of our Brother calls to us for ſuch a declaration, what God hath done for our Souls.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third reaſon is the <hi>duty of a Chriſtian</hi> ſo far as he may to <hi>avoid Scandal</hi> and <hi>Offence.</hi> Offences and mutual diſſatisfactions one in another, deſtroy all the freedom, and ſweetneſs of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans communion each with other, and it is our duty ſo to walk as to give no offence, to <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> much leſs <hi>to the Church of God</hi> 2. <hi>Cor</hi> 20. 32. There are two ways by which offence is given.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By <hi>doing ſome actions as to which we are at a perfect liberty by which we cauſe our Brother to ſin againſt God:</hi> As to theſe the Apoſtle cautioneth Chriſtians very largely both in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans</hi> and to the <hi>Corinthians:</hi> But theſe kind of offences are not obviated by Chriſtians declarations of what God hath done for their Souls, as to the influences of ſaving grace: but rather by the declaration of his <hi>knowledge,</hi> and forbearing ſuch actions, as he hath a liberty to, but no neceſſity that preſſeth him to the doing of them, at leaſt till his Brother be Satisfyed in the lawfulneſs of them.</p>
               <p n="3">2. By ſome <hi>Scandalous actions;</hi> theſe indeed are <hi>Scandala data,</hi> Scandals that are given and ſuch ſores as a Chriſtian ought by all means in his power to endeavour healing of, and whether ſuch things have been done before, or after a change wrought in our hearts, it is our duty to do what in us lyeth to remove the Scandal of them, which I know not how it can at firſt be done, without ſome declaration to the party, or Church offended, what God hath done for us, what a change he hath wrought in us, until by a contrary converſation (which is a work of time &amp; the beſt evidence) we can make it more really to appear to them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Laſtly. The <hi>Credit of our profeſſions</hi> ſome times calls to us for it; and this is the reaſon of the <hi>performance of this duty</hi> with reference <hi>to the men of the World,</hi> who ſeek all advantages to reproach the good and right ways of the Lord. But this is enough to have ſpoken <hi>doctrinally</hi> upon this argument.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Uſe. 1.</note> From hence (in the firſt place) we may obſerve. <hi>That a Child of God may know that he, or ſhe is comely.</hi> Indeed this is not the lot of every Child of God, at all times, and for them that do know it, there are degrees of their knowledge. Some have a more, ſome a leſs certain knowledge, but I ſay a good
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:61084:262"/>
                  <hi>Chriſtian may know it.</hi> The <hi>Papiſts</hi> indeed make all a Chriſtians faith to be languid, and uncertain, but <hi>Paul</hi> was perſwaded, that <hi>nothing ſhould ſeparate him from the Love of God.</hi> The Spouſe knew ſhe was <hi>ſick of Love,</hi> and here, that altho ſhe was <hi>black,</hi> yet ſhe was alſo <hi>comely,</hi> tho as the tents of <hi>Kedar,</hi> yet as the <hi>Curtains of Solomon alſo. Peter</hi> knew that he <hi>loved his Maſter,</hi> ſo as he durſt appeal to him, and ſay. <hi>Thou that knoweſt all things knoweſt that I Love thee;</hi> and St. <hi>John</hi> giving us rules how we might know that we are <hi>tranſlated from death to Life,</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that it might be known, and if it had not been poſſible ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Peter</hi> would not have quickened us to the uſe of all diligence <hi>to make our calling and election ſure.</hi> That every good Chriſtian doth not <hi>certainly know</hi> his <hi>Spiritual Eſtate,</hi> is unqueſtionable; That he <hi>who doth know it</hi> this day, may fall into doubts and fears concerning it, is alſo certain: But it is as plain in Scripture, that a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> may walk in the ſenſe and view of his own ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and uprightneſs, he may know it by the more <hi>ſpecial influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the holy Spirit,</hi> which <hi>witneſſeth with our Spirits, that we are the Children of God,</hi> and this is of all other, the moſt certain and comfortable knowledge. He may alſo know it, by the more ordinary influence of the Spirit of grace, ſupporting the Soul, in the view of its own habits of grace. And certainly a good Chriſtian is highly concerned to labour after this knowledge, as for the Quiet, Peace and Satisfaction of his own Spirit ſo for the glory of God, the good of others, and the upholding of our ſelves againſt the calumnies, and reproaches of evil men: How ſhall a Chriſtian, that is full of fears, and continually doubting, whether God hath done any thing for his Soul or no, ever give God the honour and glory of what he hath done for him, and wrought in him. A ſad, and dejected Spirit can never walk thankfully and praiſe God, for what he hath done for him: how ſhall ſuch a Soul be ſerviceable to his Brother in diſtreſs! The Apoſtle adviſeth working with our hands that we may have ſomething to give to thoſe that need, and tells us, It is more noble to give then to receive; the deſpondent, doubting Chriſtian is always a receiver he cannot be a giver of advice and counſel, to others, How ſhall ſuch a Chriſtian bear up againſt the ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions of the Devil, or againſt the reproaches, Scandals, and calumnies of the men of the World: Upon all theſe and many more accounts, Chriſtians are highly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:61084:263"/>
to look for ſuch evidences as may Satisfy them that altho they have been black, and are black through the frequent renewings of corruption, yet they are comely through grace. If any ask what they ſhould do that they may know, I know no better way, then the ſtudying the perfection of the new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to <hi>perfect holineſs in the Lords fear;</hi> for tho it be true that we may be deceived in our judgments of the true features of the new creature, yet it is alſo true that the true <hi>teſtimony of the Spirit, is in concurrence</hi> with <hi>the witneſs of our Spirits</hi> and where there is a faileur of that <hi>Teſtimony</hi> there can be no <hi>certainty</hi> of the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Uſe. 2.</note> We may learn from hence that it is not <hi>the ſole work of a Chriſtian to be complaining of himſelf, and loading himſelf with ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations, and charges of blackneſs.

Thankfulneſs, and rejocing in the Lord, and in his Salvation, are great pieces of duty.

I will endeavour to ſhew you the vanity of theſe pleas in bar to this duty. 2. I ſhall give you ſome directions in order to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of it, with which I ſhall conclude this diſcourſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt plea is <hi>Chriſtians own incertainty,</hi> and this is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a great plea, for no man ought to boaſt beyond his line, or to arrogate that to himſelf, which he doth not find in himſelf, we ought therefore to labour to bring our Souls to a certainty, and the doubting Chriſtian hath this advantage, that the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt certainty is that which followeth doubting but though it may be thou haſt not an infallible certainty, yet poſſibly thou haſt a <hi>moral certainty,</hi> though not a certainty free from all doubts, and fears, yet not incumbred with ſtrong doubts, and tormenting fears, though not an aſſurance, yet a good hope through grace, yea, ſuch an hope as ſhall not make aſhamed. Thou mayeſt declare how it is with thy Soul, though thou canſt not declare what is not in thy Soul. I am not preſſing any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian to arrogate to himſelf, what there is no ground for, but only to own in himſelf, what God hath wrought in him, and for him. <hi>Fears,</hi> and <hi>doubts,</hi> though they alwaies argue a weakneſs in faith, yet they ordinarily argue a truth of grace, and faith, it may be, becauſe of thy clouds, and doubts, thou canſt ſee no beauty and comelineſs in thy ſelf, yet others may ſee a great beauty and comelineſs in thee.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſecond plea is <hi>Modeſty,</hi> a vertue which excellently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh the Children of God, who are called Virgins. It is the duty of the Children of God, not to think of themſelves above what they ought to think, it is pity that ſo comely an habit ſhould be turned into ſin, and that Chriſtians under pretence of avoiding Pride, and Oſtentation, ſhould run upon another Rock, and neglect a duty of ſo much tendency as I have ſhewed this to be, to the glory of God, and the good of others. Let me

therefore examine this a little ſtrictly. <hi>Pride</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher) is a vice by which we judge our ſelves worthy of more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour then indeed we are, and ſlight, or deſpiſe others who indeed have, or whom at leaſt we judge to have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> of this, or that perfection then we have.</hi> The <hi>Schoolmen</hi> tell us there are three ways by which we may diſcover this ſinful tumor, or ſwelling in an opinion of our ſelves.</p>

                  <hi>3</hi> When we ſlight, and deſpiſe others whom we judge to come ſhort of our perfections. <hi>They likewiſe preſcribe a threefold remedy for this diſtemper. 1.</hi> The conſideration of our native weakneſs and infirmity. <hi>2.</hi> The conſideration of the infinite greatneſs, and perfection of God. <hi>3.</hi> The conſideration of our own gifts and graces, in the ſhortneſs, and imperfections of them. <hi>In ſhort therefore, there is no need to fear the diſcovery of any Pride in the acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of what God hath done for us, provided,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That we do not <hi>play the Hypocrites,</hi> boaſting beyond our <hi>line,</hi> of what we never experienced, what God never wrought in us. The proud man arrogateth more to himſelf, then doth belong unto him.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> Provided, that thou doeſt intitle God to all that thou haſt of good in thee. <hi>It is truly ſaid by the Schoolmen.</hi> Cum aliquis aeſtimate bonum quod habet ab alio, ac ſi haberet a ſeipſo, fertur per conſequens appetitus ejus ſupra modum in propriam excellentiam: <hi>That is; If a man judgeth that, that good which he hath from another, proceedeth from himſelf, his deſire is immoderately carried out after his own excellency, and this is Pride. They are therefore highly concerned to look to themſelves as to this, that attribute ſo much to the</hi> power of mans will, <hi>without any influence of ſpecial, and diſtinguiſhing grace; you ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve how careful St.</hi> Paul <hi>was againſt this upon all occaſions, where he mentioneth his grace.</hi> I live <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> but yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me, and the life which I now live in the fleſh, I live by faith in the Son of God. I was a Perſecutor, a Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, Injurious, but I obtained mercy, and the grace of the Lord was exceedingly abundant in me, with faith, and love, which is in Chriſt Jeſus. I am the leaſt of the Apoſtles, not worthy to be called an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle—
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:61084:264"/>
But by the Grace of God I am what I am. <hi>It is no pride to acknowledge what God hath given us, and done for us, but to arrogate it to our ſelves, as done by our own power, this is pride.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Provided</hi> (3dly,) <hi>That thou doſt not deſpiſe the day of ſmall things in the Souls of others:</hi> Scorning, contemning, and deſpiſing thoſe, for whom God hath done, or we think that he hath done leſs then he hath done for us. This will ſpeak <hi>Pride,</hi> the proud Soul as he alwaies arrogateth too much to himſelf, ſo he alwaies giveth too little to his Brother, and haughtily over-looketh what he hath, ſo that his Brother alwaies ſeems low, and vile in his Eyes.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <hi>4. Laſtly, Provided,</hi> That with the acknowledgment of thy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and graces, thou conjoyneſt an admiration of Gods goodneſs, an acknowledgment of thy unworthineſs, and of thy ſinful failings, and imperfections. <hi>Thus you ſee the Spouſe doth in this Text.</hi> I am black <hi>(ſaith ſhe)</hi> but comely. <hi>So did</hi> Paul <hi>in the places I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore quoted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. A third Bar to this is <hi>Novelty.</hi> This can only be pleaded with reference to our acknowledgments to the Church, or the Officers of it, with reſpect to our either being admitted into a full communion with it in all Ordinances, or being reſtored to it after ſome lapſe for the more private practice of it to our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, it is as old as <hi>David,</hi> as may be ſeen from <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66. <hi>v.</hi> 16, 17. As to the former, it was from the beginning certainly thus. None were admitted into the Goſpel Church without a profeſſion of <hi>repentance,</hi> and <hi>faith in Chriſt.</hi> None after a lapſe or Apoſtacy was reſtored to the Church without it. Indeed through the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of times, both the one and the other practice, hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated into a meer formality, and now it ſeemeth new to us. But as it is but a reduction of an <hi>Apoſtolical, and Primitive Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,</hi> ſo there certainly is nothing more reaſonable, both for the comfort of the particular Soul, from whom this declaration is deſired, and for the ſatisfaction of the Miniſter of Chriſt, who is but a Steward of the myſteries of Chriſt, and ought to be faithful, and alſo for the mutual ſatisfaction of ſuch as are to be Members of the ſame Body.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But laſtly, (whatever is pretended) it is much to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that <hi>Pride</hi> is the true hinderance of this Chriſtian, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual duty. 1. <hi>Either we think it beneath us to diſcourſe of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi>
                  <pb n="520" facs="tcp:61084:265"/>
                  <hi>things, and to acknowledge all to the free grace of God:</hi> Or,</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>We think we come ſhort of ſome perfections which others have attained, and we are aſhamed to let others know how ſhort we are.</hi> But O that Chriſtians would grow more <hi>familiar</hi> with ſpiritual things. We think that it is a piece of Charity if we hear of a Neighbour that is full of pain, or very ſick ofſuch adiſtemper as we have formerly laboured under, to goand tell him how we were, what we did, what effect and iſſue it had, but we find an awkneſs to relate to fellow Chriſtians, how we lay labouring under the guilt of ſin, and perplexities of conſcience, and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens of temptations, and what our applications to God were, and what relief we found from his free grace and mercy. But in the performance of this, as well as other duties, there may be miſcarriages. Let me therefore conclude with offering ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections for the better management of this duty. They ſhall be three.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Take heed to the principle moving thee to ſuch actions.</hi> That muſt be <hi>love to God</hi> (the principle of all religious actions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which we do nothing acceptably, this is determined by the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 1, 2. <hi>It is love that is the fulfilling of the law,</hi> and indeed we can no otherwiſe in any point fulfil it. Take heed that <hi>ſelf-love</hi> be not the principle, if by it thou ſeekeſt thy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and praiſe; <hi>ſelf love</hi> only principleth thee, but if thou doſt it, that God may have the glory of his Grace, that the Souls of others may be profited, and advantaged. That offences may be prevented, or removed. That the dirt may be wiped off, which the world throweth upon profeſſion. In theſe caſes the love of God is thy principle.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Take heed to the manner of thy doing it.</hi> As to that I ſhall only hint 2 things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. See that God hath all the glory. <hi>It is lawful for thee to</hi> boaſt of the Grace of God, <hi>but you muſt be ſure to</hi> boaſt in the Lord, <hi>and in all thy acknowledgments of any ſpiritual good, thou oughteſt to ſing with</hi> David, <hi>Pſal 115. 1.</hi> Not unot us O Lord, not unto us, but to thy Name be given the Glory, for thy mercy, and for thy truth ſake.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Do it with all the greateſt lowlineſs, and humility of mind and expreſſion that thou art able,</hi> ſo as nonw may for what thou haſt received of grace, <hi>think of thee above what he ought to think<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Paul</hi> forbare to ſpeak what he could have ſpake, after his rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:61084:265"/>
into the third Heavens, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 6. <hi>Leſt</hi> (as he ſaith) <hi>any ſhould think of me above that which he ſeeth in me, or that he hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth of me.</hi> We are to have a care of the corruptions of others hearts, as well as our own.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Look to the ſimplicity of thy heart in the end of thy action.</hi> This will indeed be much regulated from the <hi>principle;</hi> if the principle be true, the end will be ſo. A man can do nothing out of a true principle of love to God, but his end will be the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and glory of God; if the principle be <hi>ſelf-love,</hi> the end will be our own honour, praiſe, and applauſe, to have the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of a religious man in the world, and to appear to be what indeed we are not. Now if thy end be the <hi>honour and glory of God,</hi> you have heard, that is no other way attainable, but either by the predication of his <hi>goodneſs,</hi> or by the <hi>doing of his will,</hi> either in the doing good to others, or the preventing of ſcandals and offences, or upholding the credit, and reputation of Religion, &amp;c. But of all theſe things I have diſcourſed more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before.</p>

               <p>What the blackneſs of the Church, or of the particular Soul is, I have heretofore largely diſcourſed.

No one member can be <hi>afflicted,</hi> or <hi>pained,</hi> but the whole body feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it, and hath ſome ſenſe of it. The Apoſtle hath compared the Church (the Body of Chriſt) to the Body natural, for the <hi>order</hi> of the Parts and Members, the ſeveral offices of the Members, the mutual ſubſerviency of one Member to another, and that <hi>ſympathy</hi> which ſhould be found betwixt the Members.

So will every good Chriſtian be affected at the caſe of his Brother fallen, tho he poſſibly hath not that due ſenſe of his own fall, which he ſhould have, and at the caſe of the Church, under its blackneſs, though poſſibly the Rulers, or generality of the Members, be not ſo ſenſible of their own corruptions, and deviations, and to look upon the Spouſe of Chriſt in her <hi>blackneſs,</hi> with a mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, pitying and compaſſionate Eye, is very much the duty of every good Chriſtian, and what we find the conſtant, and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous practice of the People of God at all times.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>We may ſo far look upon the Spouſes blackneſs, as our ſight of it may inform us better, or quicken us to ſeek God on her behalf.</hi> It is our duty to pray for one another, <hi>James</hi> 5. 15. <hi>Confeſs your</hi>

How can I plead for a Church, or a particular Child of God, if I know nothing of their ſtate? how can I know it, if I may not look upon it? It is a divine indulgence granted by God to his People, that they ſhall not be heard only praying for themſelves, but for their Brethren alſo, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 16. <hi>If any man ſee his Brother ſin a ſin, which is not unto death, he ſhall ask, and he ſhall give them life for them who ſin not unto death.</hi> All a Chriſtians ſins in their own nature are mortal, and unto death. The <hi>Papiſts</hi> err in their diſtinction of ſins into ſuch as are <hi>mortal,</hi> and ſuch as are <hi>venial,</hi> but no ſin is <hi>mortal,</hi> in that ſenſe as it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies, what cannot be forgiven (ſaving only the blaſphemy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Holy Ghoſt, mentioned by our Saviour,) and in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of Gods gracious Ordination, no Child of God ſinneth, or can ſin unto death. Now where the ſin is not unto death, God hath promiſed us, on the behalf of our Brethren, that if we ſee them ſinning, and pray for them, their ſins ſhall be forgiven them. Now if they may not look upon them in any ſenſe, or to any purpoſe, how ſhould they pray for them? And thus it is highly the duty of Gods People to look both upon the Church, and the People of God, becauſe of their blackneſs through <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction. Is any man afflicted</hi> (ſaith <hi>James</hi> 5. 14.) <hi>let him pray, and let them ſend for the Elders of the Church, and let them pray over them—and the prayer of the faithful ſhall ſave the ſick, and the Lord ſhall raiſe him up, and if he hath committed ſin, it ſhall be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given him.</hi> In this ſenſe it is ſo far from being Chriſtians ſin, that it is their duty to look upon the Spouſe, <hi>becauſe ſhe is black.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Laſtly, It is Chriſtians duty to look upon the <hi>Spouſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe is black<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo far as to inable us in any meaſure to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging out their corruptions.</hi> A good Chriſtian ought ſo far to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the corruptions of a Church, as in his place to endeavour its reformation; and conſequently it cannot be his duty to have communion with her in thoſe things wherein ſhe deviateth from the rule of her Lord. It is true, the effectual Authoritative Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of a <hi>National Church,</hi> belongeth to the Rulers, if they be Chriſtians, as appeareth by all the inſtances of the Old Teſtament, concerning the Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> and ſuch a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a particular Church or Congregation, belongeth to the <hi>Officers of Chriſt in it,</hi> but every private Chriſtian hath his part,

                  <hi>viz.</hi> to inform ſuch, in whom the power is, to bear a teſtimony againſt ſuch corruptions, and not to have fellowſhip with the Church in ſuch things. I cannot grant that all <hi>Corruptions,</hi> in the <hi>Doctrine, Worſhip,</hi> or <hi>Diſcipline of a Church,</hi> are a ſufficient cauſe to conclude it no true Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and wholly to withdraw himſelf from the communion of it. But I doubt not to ſay, that it is my duty to withdraw Communion from a Church in ſuch acts, as without ſin I cannot have communion with it; but of this more by and by. The caſe is the ſame in the caſe of a <hi>lapſed Brother,</hi> I am bound to <hi>admoniſh him,</hi> to tell him of his offence, and if he will not hear me to take two or three with me. If he will not hear them to tell the Church, that he might be ſeparated from the Communion of it. The Apoſtle hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected us, <hi>If our Brother be overtaken with a fault, to reſtore him in the Spirit of meekneſs, Gal.</hi> 6. 1. Now in order to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of this, I may, yea, it is my duty to look upon my <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> when he is <hi>black,</hi> for the Lord who hath willed the end, muſt be underſtood to have alſo willed the means, that are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to that end.</p>

               <p n="1">1.

               <p n="3">3. Finally, <hi>thy own concern is not ſmall in the caſe.</hi> Upon this argument the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews perſwadeth a remembring of ſuch as are in bonds, and adverſity.

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Afflictions</hi> often <hi>really</hi> blacken <hi>the Spouſe of Chriſt, as they draw out that latent Corruption which is in their Hearts.</hi> This is true both <hi>concerning the Church, and concerning the particular Soul.</hi> 1.

Theſe things make the Church black, when the Sun looketh upon it, though in the iſſue the melting of the Church proveth the puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of it, and making it exceeding white, as you know it is with many things purified by fire, though the fire maketh them at laſt more bright, and pure, yet at firſt till their droſs be clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, they look more black, ſo it is with the Church of God in the day of its fiery trial. So it is alſo as to Particular Chriſtians. <hi>Tribulation</hi> in them at laſt worketh <hi>Patience,</hi> and <hi>Patience Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.</hi> and <hi>Experience Hope.</hi> Even ſuch an hope as <hi>will not make aſhamed,</hi> but this is after ſome excerciſe therein. Hence ſaith the Apoſtle, Heb. 12. 11. <hi>Now no chaſtening for the preſent, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>oth to be joyous, but grievous. Nevertheleſs afterwards it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of Righteouſneſs, unto them which are exerciſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.</hi>
                  <pb n="540" facs="tcp:61084:275"/>
How black did holy <hi>Job</hi> look, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. When he <hi>Curſed the day of his birth.</hi> Who afterward being exerciſed with a long afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on came out white. Till by Tribulation the Soul cometh to be humbled, and tamed to the will of God, and to have his will melted into a reſignation to the will of God, till his faith, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience come to be both tryed, and to have their perfect work. Tribulation, and Perſecution maketh the Spouſe really black, like the Perſon that hath taken Phyſick to purge out ſome ill humours, ſo long as his Phyſick is working, and ſtrugling with the peccant humours, he is ſicker, and appeareth worſe then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he took it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But ſecondly. Tho <hi>Perſecution and Tribulation may at firſt make the Spouſe really black;</hi> yet they make her appear much more black then ſhe is in the Eyes of the world, and the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of men and women in it, of which a various account may be given, I will inſtance but in two or three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt is <hi>the impreſſions which the calumnies, and ſlanders of Enemies thrown upon the Church, and upon believers, have upon many people.</hi> There is nothing more ordinary, then when the Enemies of God are in their higheſt rage againſt his People, to have their mouths fulleſt of obloquy and ſlander againſt them. Thus <hi>David</hi> complains, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 35. 11. that in the day of his ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity, <hi>Falſe witneſſes did riſe up againſt him, and laid to his charge things that he knew not.</hi> The men of the world, whoſe malice, and hatred, prompteth them to injurious actions againſt innocent perſons, conceive themſelves obliged to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt the common reaſon of the world, which teacheth them to cry out againſt ſuch acts of violence, with raiſing lies, and ſlanders concerning ſuch as they ſo oppreſs, and perſecute, he that is any thing acquainted with the <hi>Pſalms of David,</hi> or other parts of Holy Writ, will find that what we ſee in the age we live in, was but the old practice of wicked and profane Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, aſhamed to own the true cauſe of their hatred, and malice. It was <hi>Matchiavels</hi> maxime, <hi>Fortiter calumniare, aliquid adhae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rebit,</hi> lay loud enough (though never ſo falſe) upon thy adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, ſomething will ſtick to them, and indeed it is hardly imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable but it ſhould.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſecond reaſon of this judgment is, becauſe the moſt of men judge of <hi>blackneſs, and comelineſs by a meer ſenſual Eye.</hi> The life of the Spouſe is an <hi>hidden life,</hi> her beauty is an <hi>hidden beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
                  <pb n="541" facs="tcp:61084:275"/>
The world doth not conſider the afflictions of Gods People <hi>Spiritually,</hi> as they are the tokens of <hi>Divine Love (for whom the Lord loveth, he chaſteneth, and ſcourgeth every Child whom he receiveth)</hi> nor as they purge <hi>away</hi> the Souls droſs, and take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way its <hi>Tin,</hi> as they melt it, and try it, and give <hi>faith</hi> a perfect exerciſe, and patience a perfect work, nor are they able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the Souls exerciſes of <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>patience,</hi> of <hi>humility,</hi> and <hi>meekneſs, and quiet ſubmiſſion to the will of God.</hi> The afflicted Spouſe may not only be exceeding beautiful in the Eyes of Chriſt, but in the Eyes of the Saints and People of God in their affliction, and tribulation, and the generality of men yet ſee no beauty and comelineſs in them, becauſe their beauty is ſpiritually diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; all that is external, is <hi>blackueſs,</hi> and <hi>unlovelineſs,</hi> they are only <hi>glorious within.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The generality of men and women in the world judge of the love and hatred of God, by what is before men in this life.</hi> The beauty of the Spouſe of Chriſt lieth in two things. 1. <hi>In her acceptation with God.</hi> 2. <hi>In her habits of grace, and the exerciſe of them,</hi> both theſe are hidden from the Eyes of the world, they ſee not the internal frame of a believers Soul (as I but now told you) and as their habits of grace are hidden things <hi>(the world knoweth us not,</hi> faith <hi>John)</hi> ſo their ſtate of favour, and acceptation with God is an hidden thing alſo; they cannot underſtand how God ſhould love him or her, againſt whom he ſuffers men to prevail to ſuch a degree, ſo that the wicked devours the men that are more righteous then they; they judge of Gods love, and hatred to Souls, by what in this life happens to them. The Apoſtles phraſes, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 8, 9. are all riddles to them; <hi>we are troubled, ſaith he, on every ſide,</hi> but not diſtreſſed, we are perplexed, <hi>but not in deſpair, perſecuted, but not forſaken, caſt down, but not deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi> I have done with the Doctrinal part of my diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Uſe 1.</note> Is this the <hi>lot of the Spouſe of Chriſt,</hi> to be Sun-burnt with af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, and perſecutions? Is it their lot to be afflicted, and will afflictions make them <hi>black,</hi> and <hi>appear more black</hi> then poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly they are, what then is our duty?</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the firſt place, <hi>it is certainly our duty to expect afflictions of this nature, and to expect ſuch uſage under them, as the people of God before us have conſtantly met with.</hi> Our Saviour Chriſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving given to his hearers the law of his Diſcipleſhip, <hi>Lu.</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> 27. <hi>And whoſoever doth not bear his croſs, and come after me, cannot be</hi>

                  <hi>my Diſciple;</hi> addeth further. <hi>v.</hi> 28. 29, 30, 31. <hi>For which of you intending to build a Tower, ſitteth not down firſt, and counteth the coſt, whether he hath ſufficient to finiſh it, left happily after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able to finiſh it, all begin to mock him, ſaying this man began to build, and was not able to finiſh? Or what King going to make war againſt another Ring, ſitteth not down firſt, and conſulteth whether he be able with ten thouſand to meet him, that cometh againſt him with twenty thouſand. Or elſe while the other is yet afar off, he ſendeth an Embaſſage, and deſireth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of peace?</hi> Our Saviour Chriſt by thoſe two ſimilitudes, teacheth us all the duty of a pre-conſideration, a thinking be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand what may afterwards happen to us in the profeſſion of religion, and the owning of him, and the profeſſion of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. It is certainly a true ſaying, <hi>Mala inopinata graviora,</hi> the leſs proſpect we have of evils, the more inexpected they come upon us, the more heavy they prove to us; unthought of evils are alwaies moſt intolerable, becauſe we are leaſt prepared for them. Let every good Chriſtian therefore live in view of thoſe <hi>Afflictions</hi> which the Apoſtle calleth the <hi>Afflictions of the Goſpel,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 8. Either becauſe they conſtantly, or moſt ordinarily follow the profeſſion of it, or becauſe indeed it is unreaſonable to think that any perſon ſhould either adhere to the propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of truth contained in it, or live up to the rule of life, which the Goſpel preſcribeth, and be free from them. If (ſaith our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 15. 18.) <hi>The world hateth you, you know it hated me before it hated you,</hi> and v. 20. <hi>Remember the word that I ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, the Servant is not greater then the Lord, if they have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted me, they will alſo perſecute you. Theſe things</hi> (ſaith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>John</hi> 16. 1. 2, 3.) <hi>I have ſpoken unto you that you ſhould not be offended, they ſhall put you out of the Synagogues, yea, the time cometh, that whoſoever killeth you, will think that he doth God good ſervice.</hi> It is a moſt unreaſonable thing for men to meet with more pleaſing things, and proſperity, in the profeſſion of Religion, then the Author of that Religion, or any of his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ever met with, or then he hath told us we ſhould meet with in the profeſſion of it, who knew all things; or that we ſhould expect more tranquillity in the profeſſion of <hi>Religion,</hi> then the nature of that profeſſion, conſidered together with the <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and corruption of the world,</hi> doth promiſe the profeſſors of it. It is true there is nothing in the nature and profeſſion of
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:61084:276"/>
the Chriſtian Religion, conſidered ſingly, and apart by itſelf, that is unlovely, or diſobliging to any; it is a Religion full of <hi>good will toward men.</hi> But conſidering this <hi>Religion,</hi> together with the <hi>corruption of the world,</hi> there is much in it, which he that looketh but with a rational Eye, will ſee that the world is never like to bear better then it hath hitherto done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it tieth a man up to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Propoſitions according to the revelations of the Word. To live a life according to the rule of the word. To worſhip God according to the preſcriptions of the Word, in all things, it calleth a man to the Law, and to the Teſtimony.</hi> It obligeth every man in his place to bear a <hi>teſtimony</hi> againſt whatſoever is contrary to the ſtrict rule of the Word. Now whoſo conſidereth either the <hi>ignorance of the world,</hi> which knoweth not the Son of God, nor him that ſent him, nor what is the revealed will of God, or the <hi>ſenſuality of the world,</hi> how mad upon their luſts the moſt of Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are: Or the <hi>Pride</hi> of the world, which maketh men impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, either of a <hi>verbal reproof, by doctrine and admonitions, or real reproof,</hi> by a quite contrary converſation, more pleaſing to God, &amp; acceptable to, and beautiful in the ſight of men: Or the <hi>affectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of dominion over the conſcience,</hi> which a multitude are poſſeſt of, and their impatience at good Chriſtians not owning, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to their dictates, and ſaying as they ſay, and doing as they do, can hardly imagine how thoſe that will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus, ſhould live any long time in the world without perſecution. Now the <hi>expectation</hi> of thoſe <hi>ſearchings,</hi> and Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burnings, will have various good effects upon the Soul.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It will put the Soul upon preparing for them.</hi> He that liveth in the expectation of trials, will be oft-times putting the caſe to himſelf, if ſuch a tryal ſhould be, what ſhould I do? My Soul wouldſt thou ſtand to, or deſert the profeſſion of thy faith? wouldſt thou keep cloſe to God, or depart from him? we ſhould be laying up ſomething in ſtore againſt an evil day.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Expected tryals (as I before told you) <hi>are alwaies lighter, and more tolerable,</hi> and endured with more <hi>courage,</hi> and <hi>patience.</hi> We are not ſo frighted with evils, which we ſee at diſtances, and view in the approaches they make to us. Nothing more <hi>weakneth</hi> a Soul in the bearing of an evil, as a ſudden ſurpriſal, like an <hi>Apoplexy</hi> to the body, it at once ſtops thoſe paſſages by which the Spirits ſhould diſcover, and exert themſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Br. 2.</note> Secondly, This Doctrine calls to Chriſtians for patience, and that both under <hi>Perſecution,</hi> and <hi>Afflictions,</hi> and under the <hi>cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,</hi>
                  <pb n="544" facs="tcp:61084:277"/>
and <hi>obloquies of the world,</hi> becauſe of them. Expectation of tryals is a previous duty in order to our preparation for them. <hi>Patience</hi> is a preſent duty, when the Chriſtian is fallen under them. It is indeed the work of the day; that very grace, which in the hour of tribulation ſhould have its perfect work, it lieth partly in a quiet ſubmiſſion to the good will and pleaſure of God, becauſe he hath laid it upon us, an holding our peace, becauſe it is the Lords doing, partly in a <hi>quiet waiting for God</hi> in the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of his promiſes made to his People under ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. There are two things that call for our patience under afflictions. 1. The <hi>ſmart</hi> of the <hi>Affliction,</hi> for no affliction is joyous, but grievous. 2. The <hi>reproach of the world</hi> under it, this often doubleth the affliction and maketh it more grievous, and intolerable. Now conſider how many things have occurred in this diſcourſe, which may excite our patience under both theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>This is the lot of the People of God.</hi> There is none of them but the <hi>Sun</hi> at one time or other works upon. The Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> 1 Theſ. 3. 3. <hi>That no man ſhould be moved by their Afflictions, for</hi> (faith he) <hi>your ſelves know that we are appointed thereunto.</hi> There is a great deal in that ſaying to quiet the Spirits of Chriſtians under the burthens of tryals. 1. <hi>God hath laid thoſe burthens upon them.</hi> I held my peace (ſaith <hi>David) becauſe it was thy doing. It is the Lord</hi> (ſaid that good man) <hi>let him do what ſoever he pleaſeth.</hi> Perhaps (ſaith <hi>David) God hath bidden him curſe.</hi> It is a mighty thing to ſilence the Spirit of a Chriſtian, when he can ſee the hand of God in it. 2. <hi>It is the Lords appointment.</hi> What hath befallen us in purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of an eternal counſel; this ſpeaketh the tryal eventually ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, it ſpeaketh it alſo good for his People, for he hath not appointed us unto wrath, nor to any means of that tendency. Nor is it thy lot alone, but the lot of all thoſe who will live godlily in Chriſt Jeſus. The Apoſtles themſelves were appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thereunto, and wherein are we better, then our Fathers, or our Brethren?</p>
               <p n="2">2. You have likewiſe heard why God hath appointed our lot to be <hi>Trials,</hi> and <hi>Afflictions,</hi> for the <hi>puniſhment of our ſins, and for the tryal, and exerciſe of our Graces;</hi> this alſo calls for pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. <hi>Why ſhould a living man complain?</hi> a man for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his iniquity? We have much leſs reaſon to be diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed at the trial, and exerciſe of our graces.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="545" facs="tcp:61084:277"/>
3. You have heard <hi>upon what miſtakes it is that the World ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts the Chriſtian black by reaſon of Afflictions,</hi> becauſe they judge of their complexions by a meer ſenſual Eye, and from a meer erroneous judgment. We have therefore no reaſon to be diſquieted, becauſe of it. But indeed the main uſe we ſhould<note place="margin">Uſe 3.</note> make of this point, ſhould be for <hi>Caution;</hi> and that in two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That afflictions may not blacken us.</hi> 2. <hi>That we do not judge others black, becauſe of them.</hi> 1. Will afflictions blacken the Spouſe of Chriſt? Let us take heed that they have not this ill influence upon us. We have heard that they no otherwiſe make us black then as they are occaſions to draw out our <hi>luſts</hi> and <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions.</hi> This is that which we are more eſpecially to watch upon. In afflictive providences, <hi>God tryeth us,</hi> and <hi>Satan and the world alſo try, and tempt us.</hi> God tryeth our <hi>faith,</hi> our <hi>patience,</hi> our <hi>ſubmiſſion to his will,</hi> whether we will deny our ſelves, and take up the Croſs and follow him. The <hi>Devil,</hi> and the men of the World, which are the Devils inſtruments, try us, whether we will deſert our profeſſion, deny the Lord that bought us, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the ways of God, and imbrace a preſent World. If upon Gods tryal his ends be obtained, then are we by our afflictions <hi>purified,</hi> and made white, if the Devil and his inſtruments pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail upon us, then are we by our afflictions made black. This is the thing we are to take heed of <hi>Job</hi> 2. 3. after that God had taken away <hi>Jobs Eſtate, and Children,</hi> he ſaith to Satan, <hi>Haſt thou conſidered my Servant</hi> Job, <hi>that there is none like him in all the Earth, a perfect, and an upright man, one that feareth God, and eſcheweth evil, and ſtill he holdeth faſt his integrity, although thou moveſt me againſt him to deſtroy him without a cauſe.</hi> How white there did <hi>Job</hi> appear after his afflictions?</p>
               <p>But I ſhall not inlarge my diſcourſe to afflictions in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, but limit it to ſuch afflictions as are more peculiar to the Spouſe of Chriſt, and which I have had a more ſpecial reference to in my former diſcourſe, <hi>viz. Perſecutions,</hi> or ſufferings for our <hi>adherence</hi> to the truths of the Goſpel, and the good ways of God. Let us take heed that we be not made black by afflictions of this nature, which we ſhall be, if by them we be <hi>moved</hi> from our good opinion of the ways of God, from our profeſſion, or practice of them; there is no ſinner more black then the <hi>Apoſtate.</hi> See 2 <hi>Pet,</hi> 2. 20. 21. <hi>For if after they have eſcaped the pollutions</hi>
                  <pb n="546" facs="tcp:61084:278"/>
                  <hi>of the world through the knowledge of the Lord, and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, they are again intangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worſe with them than the beginning. For it is better ſor them not to have known the way of righteouſneſs, then after they have known it, to turn from the Holy Commandment delivered unto them.</hi> Indeed failings in a time of Perſecution are cauſed from a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cauſe. Sometimes meerly from the <hi>fear of life, or ſome great danger</hi> that will befall to men, if they adhere to their former profeſſion; failings of this nature make a Soul <hi>look black,</hi> but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch recover themſelves, and the Lord who can have compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon our inſirmities, pities them, and recovers them out of the ſnare of the Devil; this is a <hi>blackneſs</hi> we ought to avoid, by putting on the whole Armour of God, that we may be able to ſtand in the day of the Lords Battel. But there is another <hi>defection,</hi> which is occaſioned by <hi>Perſecutions,</hi> and <hi>Afflictions</hi> of this nature: That is, when men out of a greater love to other ways in a time of tryal, renounce the truths of God they have formerly owned, and forſake the ways of God, in which they have formerly walked; to theſe now Perſecutions, and Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this nature, are but a ſlight occaſion of their <hi>defection</hi> and <hi>Apoſtacy,</hi> and this eminent difference you will find betwixt the others, and theſe: The others, though they may be prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led withal to warp, and ſtart aſide, becauſe of the greatneſs of the temptation (it was <hi>Peters caſe</hi> in the High Prieſts Hall) yet will never be prevailed with to ſpeak evil of, and to revile the truths of God which they have owned, nor the ways of God, in which they have formerly walked, and others yet walk. The others being prevailed upon to their Apoſtacy meerly from the luſts of their hearts, and the greater love they have alwaies had, (tho like Hypocrites they have concealed it) to looſer principles, and a looſer way of living, take themſelves concerned to reproach their former ways, and thoſe who yet walk in them. This is a dreadful blackneſs, not a tincture upon the face only, but a tincture of the heart, which by occaſion of Perſecution for the Goſpel, breaketh out into the more exteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our converſation. To enforce this caution, I ſhall only mention three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That this is the <hi>affection only of the ſtony ground, Mat.</hi> 13. 6, 21. It is a certain ſign, that thoſe never received the Seed of the Word <hi>into honeſt, and good hearts,</hi> that they never had <hi>any</hi>
                  <pb n="547" facs="tcp:61084:278"/>
                  <hi>root in themſelves who when tribulation, and perſecution ariſeth, becauſe of the word, by and by they are offended.</hi> He that receiveth the truth, in the Love of it cannot ſo eaſily abandon the <hi>profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it,</hi> 1 <hi>John.</hi> 2. 19. <hi>They went out from us, they were not of us, for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us, but they went out that they might be made manifeſt that they were not all of us.</hi> The day of <hi>Perſecution</hi> and <hi>tribulation</hi> for the <hi>Goſpel ſake</hi> is the day of the manifeſtation and diſcovery of hypocrites. I do not think that all ſhrinking in a time of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution is a note of hypocriſy, there is a ſhrinking through <hi>fear</hi> in the time of <hi>great temptation</hi> (ſo <hi>Peter</hi> ſhrank.) But for men to make a defection, out of a principle of <hi>luſt</hi> and greater Love to other ways, and to reproach and ſpeak Evil of the ways of God (which by the way is a certain indication of ſuch a defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction) this ſpeaketh the man or woman to be no better then an <hi>hypocrite</hi> nor ever to have been other, tho, to ſerve his luſts, he diſguiſed himſelf with a mask of holineſs, and Religion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly conſider, <hi>That no ſinner</hi> ſo <hi>reproacheth the good and holy ways of God as ſuch a ſinner doth.</hi> He tells the World that he hath tryed them, that there is nothing in them, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the ignorance &amp; prejudices of his education &amp; youth led him into them, that the ways of ſin &amp; profaneneſs, of Formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Superſtition are better, and therefore he is at laſt grown wiſer then to take ſuch pains to go to heaven. If I would pick out a wretch out of the whole herd of ſinners to reproach God, to blaſpheme the Goſpel and the ways of holineſs, I would pick out onethat had been formerly a <hi>profeſſor,</hi> and had turned away from his profeſſion this wretch pretendeth from experience to juſtify what others do but looſely diſcourſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly <hi>no ſinners muſt expect a more dreadful Vengeance.</hi> The reaſon is evident, becauſe none ſin againſt more light. There is no man who hath made a profeſſion, and lived in any practice of Religion, but knows that there is no iniquity in it, nothing but what ſuteth the common reaſon of mankind not debauched through luſt, and that thoſe who in any meaſure live up to the profeſſion of the Goſpel, are (if ſober heathens were to be judges) the beſt of men, with reſpect to all duty which the light of Nature teacheth toward the Divine Being, and all good offices towards men. I ſay there is none who hath made any profeſſion but knows this, and in all his Evil ſpeaking of

               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> That both the particular Chriſtians, <hi>and</hi> the Church of Chriſt in theſe conflicts will appear black.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>True Chriſtians will have conflicts with their luſts, and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> This is ſo great a truth that this Spiritual conflict is a note of the truth of grace in the Soul. It is indeed as wars uſe to be, ſometimes hotter, ſometimes cooler and more remiſs, and the Soul is in it ſometimes more, ſometimes leſs a conquerour, as God will pleaſe to afford the Soul more or leſs of his ſtrength, but it is always ſomething. When God did bring the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> into <hi>Canaan,</hi> he was not pleaſed at once to drive them cut, but <hi>by little and little, Exod.</hi> 23. 28, 29. neither were they faultleſs, for many of the Tribes did not drive them out; <hi>Judah</hi> could not drive them out, <hi>Judg.</hi> 1. 19. It is ſaid of ſeveral of the other Tribes <hi>that they did not drive them out.</hi> Upon which God reſolveth that <hi>he would not drive them out;</hi> but they ſhould be as thorns in their ſides. God in bringing Souls out of a <hi>ſtate of nature,</hi> into a <hi>ſtate of grace,</hi> doth not wholly drive out <hi>luſt and corruption,</hi> he bringeth ſin out of its <hi>Dominion, Rom,</hi> 6. 13. So as it reigneth not in the mortal Bodies of the Saints; ſin like the tree in <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzars</hi> viſion, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4. 14. is <hi>hewed down,</hi> many of its branches are cut off, and its leaves, and its fruit is ſcattered, and the Soul is got from under it, but yet the <hi>ſtump of its roots are in the Earth,</hi> tho bound with a <hi>band of Iron and Braſs,</hi> kept un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by the <hi>law of the</hi> Chriſtians mind, that he getteth no domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, the Soul is not under the power of it. Now as there was a continual war betwixt the <hi>Canaanites</hi> left in the land, and the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> ſo there is a continual war and ſpiritual combate, betwixt thoſe <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> theſe paſſions of ſin, theſe <hi>luſtings of the fleſh,</hi> and the <hi>Spiritual part</hi> of the Spiritual man. <hi>Paul</hi> doth excellently deſcribe this conflict, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 21. <hi>I find then a law, that when I would do good, evil is preſent with me, for I delight in the law of God, as to my inward man. But I ſee another law in my members warring againſt the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of ſin, which is in my members.

and <hi>the Spirit againſt the fleſh, and theſe are contr ary, the one to the other.</hi> And indeed in the laſt words lyes the reaſon of this war, and conflict. It is of the nature of contraries to expell one another, not to indure one another in the ſame ſubject, but to be in a continual combate till the one, or the other hath got the Victory. <hi>Grace in</hi> Scripture is compared to <hi>light,</hi> ſin to darkneſs, light and darkneſs mutually expell one another, ſo doth <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>luſt.</hi> Now both theſe being in the Soul of the regenerate man, who is but Sanctified in part, and neither of them being <hi>lazy</hi> and <hi>inactive,</hi> but active, and operative principles, there muſt be this conflict which I have mentioned, this war in our members, which makes the People of God look black.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And as it fares with individual Chriſtians, with reſpect to their luſts, and corruptions: ſo it alſo fareth with the <hi>Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Spouſe,</hi> the Church of Chriſt, with reſpect to falſe Brethren, who are the preſumptive, but not the true members of it. 1. <hi>ſuch will be in the Church while it is upon the Earth.</hi> 2. And <hi>theſe will be angry with the true members of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. while the Church is upon the Earth, it will be like a <hi>field of Wheat</hi> which hath <hi>tares</hi> in it; the Goſpel and the preaching of it is like a <hi>drag-net</hi> which draweth unto the Church, as its ſhore <hi>Fiſh,</hi> both <hi>good</hi> and <hi>bad,</hi> there will come a time, when the Lord will take his fan, and throughly purge his floor, but that will be in the day of judgment; if we look upon Gods ancient Church, the Congregation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> there was a <hi>Jannes,</hi> and a <hi>Jambnes,</hi> that <hi>reſiſted Moſes,</hi> a <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> that roſe up againſt <hi>Moſes &amp; Aaron,</hi> many falſe Prophets to miſlead People &amp; many more falſe hearts, that were eaſily miſled; the <hi>Chaldee Paraphraſt</hi> expounds the term in the Text of falſe Prophets, <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Jezebel</hi> had 300 of them at a time, a great number of the People, were ready upon all occaſions to relapſe into Idolatry, and Superſtition, as they had any Princes, that would either tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate or incourage it; <hi>Jeremiah</hi> and <hi>Micaiah,</hi> and <hi>Amos</hi> and <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah,</hi> and all the true Prophets of the Lord found that their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Children, were angry with them, ſo did thoſe that were good People amongſt them, the <hi>Prieſts</hi> were a <hi>ſnare upon Miz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peh,</hi> and a <hi>net ſpread</hi> upon <hi>Tabor,</hi> to hinder the People from attending the true Worſhip of God. Look upon the Church of Chriſt: In Chriſts little company there was a <hi>Judas,</hi> a Son of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and amongſt the multitudes that followed him, there
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:61084:281"/>
were many that followed him but <hi>for the loaves.</hi> In the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times, there was a <hi>Demas,</hi> an <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and a <hi>Philetus</hi> a <hi>Simon Magus.</hi> Many falſe Apoſtles that oppoſed <hi>Paul,</hi> and the Apoſtle to <hi>Timothy</hi> Propheſieth that there ſhall not be a leſſer plenty of them in the latter days.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Nor can it be reaſonably expected otherwiſe conſidering 1. <hi>Gods appointment,</hi> for the exerciſe of ſuch as be real and true Saints. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 19. <hi>There muſt be</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>hereſies amongſt you,</hi> that <hi>thoſe who are approved may be made manifeſt.</hi> Falſe brethren diſcover themſelves, either by the broaching of <hi>falſe doctrine,</hi> to corrupt the <hi>faith of Chriſtians.</hi> Or <hi>by bringing in undue Rites, Ceremonies and Superſtitions,</hi> to corrupt the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God. Or by a <hi>looſeneſs of converſation,</hi> diſcovering the want of the Love, and fear of God in their hearts. Now the Lord hath appointed ſuch a Conſtitution of his Church, that theſe ſhall be tolerated in it, that thoſe who are approved may be made manifeſt; contraries near one another beſt diſcover themſelves.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, Man is tyed up to a judgment <hi>according to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance.</hi> God alone judgeth the heart and according to the reality of things. Even Chriſt himſelf tho as God he was <hi>Omniſcient</hi> and needed not that any ſhould tell him what is in the heart of man, yet when he appeared in the head of his Church here upon the Earth, and acted as the chief Miniſter in and of it, he admitted a <hi>Judas</hi> into his firſt ſociety of that nature, teaching us in our admiſſions of members, whether by Baptiſm or other wiſe, to content our ſelves with a viſibility, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance; there muſt be a difference betwixt the Church <hi>viſible,</hi> and <hi>inviſible,</hi> the Church <hi>Militant</hi> and <hi>Triumphant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. But as theſe are contrary in their <hi>Principles,</hi> and in their <hi>Ends;</hi> ſo they muſt and will be contrary in their actions, and they will be angry with the true, and more ſincere Profeſſors of the Goſpel. Thus it hath been in all ages and periods of the Church, thus it is and will be. <hi>Cain</hi> was a falſe Brother in the Church in <hi>Adams</hi> Family, he roſeg<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> up againſt his brother <hi>Abel</hi> and ſlew him, becauſe he offered up a better <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and God had more reſpect unto him then he had unto <hi>Cain. Iſhmael</hi> was a falſe Brother in <hi>Abrahams Family, Eſau,</hi> in <hi>Iſaac,</hi> the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture tells you of the ill agreement betwixt <hi>Iſaacs</hi> and <hi>Iſhmael; Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau.</hi> The whole ſtory of the Church of the Jews re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:61084:281"/>
in Scripture, and of the Church of Chriſt recorded in the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> is a proof of this oppoſition, ſo is the whole ſtory of the Church, ſince the Apoſtles time, and what need we any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proof then what we have at this day? nor can any thing elſe be rationally expected, whether we conſider the falſeneſs of ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons hearts to God, and the intereſt of God, or the Pride of their hearts. Or the looſeneſs of ſuch mens principles.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The hearts of all ſuch are falſe to God, and the intereſt of God.</hi> The love of God is the thing which doth diſtinguiſh a ſincere Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian from an Hypocrite; the Hypocrite loveth God in <hi>Word, and in Tongue only,</hi> the other loves him <hi>in Deed, and in Truth.</hi> There is no faithfulneſs in an Hypocrites heart, his heart is not right with God; the true Chriſtian is ſincere for God, and ſerious, and right down in his actings, for the honour and glory of God. The other doth but mock and diſſemble, and purſueth private intereſts of his own, he ſees that profeſſion ſerveth his deſign and intereſt. Obſerve in any other thing, where two, or more are joined in the proſecution of a deſign, and one of them is ſerious, &amp; right down, and plainly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſueth his end, but the other runs along with the buſineſs for ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ends, or upon ſome otherdeſigns, but is not real in his ſcope, inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and actions for the obtaining the end which he pretendeth to; he whoſe heart is right for the work, hath no greater enemythen he who is joined with him ſeemingly in the purſuit of it. This is the caſe here, all thoſe who are viſible Members of the Church of God, are appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly coupled in a deſign for the honour and glory of God. It is the whole buſineſs of the Church of God, which is the only body of People upon the Earth, which God hath called and choſen for that purpoſe, for the predication of his name, In this Church there are ſome who do it from a ſingle and right heart, truly intending the honour and glory of God as their end; there are others, who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an ingagement to do it as much as the others, but their hearts are not right with God, do not ſtand towards that work, but drive ſome ſelf end of private honour, credit and applauſe, theſe men may do ſome things night, but they never walk with God fully; as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it was ſaid of <hi>Amaziah,</hi> one of the Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> 2 Chron. 25. 2. <hi>He did that which was right in the ſight of the Lord, but not with a perfect heart,</hi> ſo it may be ſaid of theſe, it may be they may do many things, which as to the matter of them are right in the ſight of the Lord, but they neve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> do them with a perfect heart, ſo as there can never be a good harmony betwixt, them and ſuch whoſe hearts are more ſincere and perfect. The Hypocrite will never be heartily pleaſed with the ſincere Chriſtian.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="554" facs="tcp:61084:282"/>
2. Eſpecially conſidering the <hi>Pride</hi> that is in the heart of every Hypocrite. <hi>Though the Hypocrite doth not himſelf love to do much for God in the denial of himſelf,</hi> nor will further ſerve the Lord, then he can by the ſervice of God ſerve himſelf, yet <hi>he is too proud to be patient of being outdone by any;</hi> this was the ground of that oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition which <hi>Cain</hi> gave his Brother <hi>Abel,</hi> this made him ſo wroth, and his countenance to fall, <hi>becauſe the Lord had reſpect to</hi> Abel, <hi>and to his offering, but unto</hi> Cain <hi>and his offering, he had no reſpect, Gen.</hi> 4. 4. 5. Sincere Godly Chriſtians will be doing their utmoſt for God, ſpending much of their time, and ſtrength in communion with God, they will be much in praying, much in hearing the Word, ſtrict in their walking, ready to <hi>exhort,</hi> to reprove, and admoniſh ſuch as walk diſorderly, and not as becometh the Goſpel. Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites and falſe Brethren are no more able to bear this, then they are able to obtain of themſelves to do like them. Hence are their cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of them, as Perſons that are righteous overmuch, needleſly ſtrict, and ſevere, hence their envy, and reproaches, and their watchings for their haltings, and taking all advantages to blazon their infirmities, and to make them as odious, and to look as black as they can.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another reaſon of it lyeth in the looſeneſs of their principles, both their principles of <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> and their <hi>practical prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi> directing their lives and converſations. Falſe brethren are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies looſer in one or both theſe ſorts of principles, then the ſincere Chriſtian is. The ſtudy of the Hypocrite is to <hi>form his faith,</hi> and to <hi>interpret the law of God</hi> into a conſiſtency with his luſts, that he may keep his luſts, and yet protect himſelf from the checks, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verberations of his conſcience, and flatter himſelf with hopes of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Salvation, and alſo keep up his credit, and reputation with the world. The ſincere Chriſtian hath no other deſign then to <hi>form his faith,</hi> according to the revelations of truth in the Word, and his converſation to the rule of life in the Word of God, the Word is <hi>a lamp to his feet, and a lanthorn to his paths,</hi> and from that he dares not ſtart; when the falſe Prophets told <hi>Micajah,</hi> that the Prophets had all with one mouth propheſied good to <hi>Ahab,</hi> and ſuited his humour. <hi>Micajah</hi> anſwers them. <hi>As the Lord liveth, whatſoever the Lord bids me ſpeak, that will I ſpeak.</hi> The ſame is the language of every true Chriſtian; whatſoever Propoſitions of truth I find ſpoken by Holy Men that were inſpired by God in his Word, that, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="555" facs="tcp:61084:282"/>
by, that will I do, neither adding thereunto, nor yet diminiſhing therefrom, whatſoever rules God hath given me for the order of his Church, to them I will adhere; whatſoever laws God hath given me to guide my converſation, to the obſervation of them I will keep; thus he is in all things tied up to a divine rule. But now the falſe Profeſſor hath looſer principles. He dare allow the judgment of his own natural reaſon in determining of truth, as the object of his faith, and of the Traditions, and Practice, and Precepts of men, as the rule of his Worſhip, and the will of men as to the order, and government of the Church and from one of theſe three cauſes; moſt ordinarily proceeds that oppoſition which is given to the ſtrict Servants of God from the anger of their Mothers Children. I come to the ſecond Member of the Propoſition.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>This oppoſition is one great cauſe of the Spouſes appearing black.</hi> Both the oppoſition which the particular Chriſtian hath from his own impetuous luſts, and motions to ſin, and which that part of the Church, which is alone the Spouſe of Chriſt, hath from falſe Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and the oppoſition given her by them, are a great cauſe of the Churches blackneſs, or appearing blackneſs.</p>
               <p>The grounds of it are, 1. <hi>Partly that trouble, and ſadneſs which uſually attends thoſe conflicts in the Spirits of Chriſtians.</hi> The time of War is a time of ſadneſs in that part of the world which is the ſeat of it, and the hour of this Spiritual War and Conflict is a ſad time in the Soul. <hi>Paul</hi> cryeth out, <hi>O wretched man that I am! who ſhall deliver me from this body of death?</hi> Hence are Chriſtians ſad, and heavy walkings, which the World counteth blackneſs. 2. Partly from the <hi>prevailings</hi> of ſin ſometimes in the Soul. <hi>David</hi> complained under the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> that <hi>Iniquities prevailed againſt him,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> complaineth under the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> not only of a War, but of a Victory in ſome Skirmiſhes, that the law of his Members got againſt the law of his Mind, ſo that he was brought into a captivity to the law of Sin, which was in his Members, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 23 Now ſin is that which maketh the Soul really black, and where any of the People of God in the view of the world ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coloureth himſelf, the world needeth no provocation to call them <hi>black.</hi> The Eye that is directed by a Soul full of malice, envy, and hatred, ſpies the leaſt miſcarriages in the Soul that is hated, and aggravates them with the higheſt aggravations.</p>

(too many inſtances of which we have had.) The oppoſition which Chriſtians have met with, having been a continual drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping upon them, and overpowered them, to do many things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the dictates of their own conſciences, thus loſing their beauty, it is no great wonder if they appear black. Indeed from hence almoſt are all thoſe things which render Chriſtians, and Churches black. I now come to the application.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Uſe 1.</note> Let not then Chriſtians think it ſtrange if their <hi>habits of grace find oppoſition from within, and the actings of their grace meet with oppoſition from without.</hi> There is no Child of God, but findeth upon experience that <hi>his Mothers Children are angry with him,</hi> his fleſh is many times luſting againſt the Spirit, and he findeth a War in his Members. As <hi>Rebekah</hi> was troubled, becauſe ſhe found Twins <hi>ſtrugling</hi> together in her Womb, ſo is many a good Chriſtian, when as indeed there is no greater <hi>note of Grace,</hi> then this Combate of the Fleſh and the Spirit; if thou hadſt not two parties within, there would be none of theſe conflicts, the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate man</hi> hath nothing of them, he hath motions to ſin, but no contrary habits to oppoſe, no <hi>luſtings of the Spirit againſt the Fleſh,</hi> ſuch a man may indeed from natural light, and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, under which the law of nature layeth him, ſometimes reſiſt motions to more groſs, and flagitious ſins, but this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate is rare, and in very rare caſes, and thoſe ſuch, where the law of nature is offended, or his honour, and reputation, and profit, and advantage is concerned, as to his avoiding of them; nor is the Battel ever very hot. The true Chriſtian hath a double principle, the one natural; this inclineth, and moveth him to ſin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the other <hi>ſupernatural,</hi> and infuſed. Both theſe principles are active, and operative, and theſe ſpiritual conflicts muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, the diſcovery of the truth of Grace in thy Soul doth much depend upon thy behaviour in the Spiritual Fight, and thy managery of it; if thou findeſt this conflict, if thou maintaineſt it with thy might, if thou crieſt unto God for help and ſtrength, if ordinarily thou beeſt a conquerour: Thy oppoſition is ſo far from being an evidence againſt thee, that it is a great evidence for thee.</p>
               <p>Nor let good Chriſtians wonder if the <hi>exerciſe of their grace</hi> meets with oppoſition from without, and that from their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Children too.

Theſe two parties in the Church never did, never will agree, there is in them a different Seed, they are acted from different principles, and they act to quite different ends: Let not therefore good Chriſtians wonder, and think it ſtrange if they find ſtill that their Mothers Children are angry with them; it is no more then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was the lot of the true Spouſe of Chriſt, and will be her lot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til Chriſt ſhall come, and with his Fan throughly purge his floor. Nor do you wonder if theſe things make you appear b ack. The <hi>Papiſts</hi> think they make us appear very black, when they can tell us of <hi>Errors, and Hereſies, Factions, Diviſions, and Schiſms</hi> amongſt us, and indeed it is a reproach to us, they are <hi>ſpots,</hi> and <hi>blemiſhes</hi> in the Aſſemblies of <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> But, 1.

What means their <hi>Secular Prieſts</hi> and Jeſuits ſo beſpattering one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their Books? Though it is very probable that if <hi>Proteſtants</hi> could diſpenſe with their conſciences, to with-hold from the People the ſight and knowledge of the Holy Scriptures, the rule both of their faith and life, ſo as they know no more to differ about then their Prieſts tell them; or to ſet up a <hi>Judge of all controverſies,</hi> that ſhould be infallible, and from whoſe decrees none muſt vary? And finally to ſet up an <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> to force all mens <hi>Obedience</hi> to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of that infallible Judge, under pain of death; I ſay could <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> in theſe things diſpenſe with their conſciences, to take ſuch methods for <hi>unity,</hi> they might probably arrive at as great, if not a greater unity then they can glory in, who have been ſo far from it, that themſelves reckon 30, or 32 <hi>Schiſms,</hi> and thoſe of that nature, as according to their principles deſtroy all unity, for ſo many times (ſome of which laſted a great many years too) they have been at a loſs for to find the <hi>true viſible head of the Church</hi> We know that the <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> and pureſt Churches that ever Chriſt had upon the Earth, had ſome that were indeed <hi>Mothers Children,</hi> Members of the viſible Church, but no Children of our Heavenly Father, and that theſe have conſtantly been angry with, and given oppoſition to thoſe that have been the true, and ſincere Members of the Church, and have brought in Errors, and cauſed Schiſms and Hereſies. So as we are not to wonder if the things that have been ſtill, are whiles the ſtate of the Church is yet militant, we are not indeed to cauſe them, or be the Authors or Abettors of them, but neither are we to be diſcouraged, or condemn Churches for them, who may be come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, though they have ſomething of this <hi>blackneſs</hi> thus cauſed.</p>
               <p>I ſhall ſhut up this diſcourſe with a few words of <hi>Exhortation.</hi> 1. <hi>To all ſuch as own themſelves Chriſtians, and glory in the name of the Sons and Daughters of the Church.</hi> That they would anſwer that <hi>name and relation,</hi> and not be a cauſe of the <hi>Spouſes blackneſs, or appearing blackneſs.</hi> There are two ways by which we may be ſo: 1. <hi>By a looſe and ſcandalous converſation.</hi> 2. <hi>By being angry with our Brethren.</hi> By the firſt we make the Spouſe black. By the ſecond we cauſe her to be reproached, and called, and counted black.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Take heed of a looſe and ſcandalous converſation.</hi> This makes you <hi>ſpots</hi> in the Aſſemblies of Chriſtians, and declares you to be but preſumptive Members. Can a man be a Member of Chriſt, and a
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:61084:285"/>
Member of a Harlot? Chriſts Companion, and a Pot companion? A Diſciple of Chriſt, who hath commanded us not to <hi>ſwear</hi> falſly, idly, or prophanely, and yet being a common Swearer, and Curter, and Blaſphemer? <hi>Only let your converſation</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>he as becometh the Goſpel of Chriſt.</hi> Looſe livers are the blots of any Church, the Church is a body of <hi>called ones,</hi> now you are not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to uncleanneſs, or profaneneſs, but unto purity, and holineſs. It is for your ſake that the name of Chriſt, and the body of Chriſt is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil ſpoken of. Conſider, that though it be the way of God to deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate his Church <hi>a parte meliori,</hi> from the better part of it, and therefore he calls the Church thoſe that are <hi>called, and ſanctified in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> (though they all be not ſo that are Members of the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church) yet it is the way of the World, out of their hatred both to Chriſt, and all that have relation to him, to denominate them <hi>a parte deteriori,</hi> from the worſer part, and to call all, Profeſſors of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion by the name that belongeth only to the worſer part of them. But this is not ſo proper an application of this Propoſition, which ſpeaks of the anger of falſe Brethren as the cauſe of the Spouſes black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Therefore let me ſpeak to you, whoſe corruptions will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low you to be ſo ſtrict in your walking with God as others are, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in matters of Worſhip, or your more ordinary converſation, yet not to be <hi>angry</hi> with thoſe who deſire to walk more cloſely with God then you think needful, and in ſome things dare not give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that liberty which you dare allow your ſelves. I will offer three things to your conſideration, which may help you to abate your wrath.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider firſt, <hi>How little reaſon there is for you to be offended?</hi> You all profeſs to be going the ſame journey, aiming at the ſame end, you all profeſs to be going towards the new <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> Your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute is only about the neareſt way, you are ſatisfied, that this way of worſhipping God, this courſe of Religion will bring you to your journies end, others cannot be ſo ſatisfied, but take a <hi>ſtraiter way,</hi> what reaſon is there here for thy wrath, who thinkeſt a broader will bring thee as well to thy Journies end? how doth his walking more ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prejudice thee? Thou thinkeſt thou doeſt enough in the Service of God, another thinks he can never do too much, never do enough, and therefore he heareth more, and readeth more, and prayeth oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; wherein art thou hereby prejudiced? Haſt thou not rather cauſe to bleſs God for the good example of others, and to examine thy
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:61084:285"/>
own ways, and why another ſhould not take up with thoſe meaſures in duty, with which another cannot be ſatisfied? Thou thinkeſt that in the Worſhip of God, thou mayeſt be guided and limited by the precepts, and practices, and traditions of other men: others conſidering that it is but reaſonable, <hi>(Worſhip</hi> being an Homage which the Soul payeth to God) that God ſhould preſcribe his own Homage, and conſidering that God hath declared himſelf to be a <hi>jealous God,</hi> and affixed the declaration of this his jealouſy to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Commandment, which concerneth his external Worſhip, and that in the whole courſe of Scripture, the revelations of Gods wrath appear more againſt ſins relating to the Worſhip of God, then any other ſins, they dare not in the matters of Divine Worſhip deviate from the Divine Rule; wherein art thou by this prejudiced? What reaſon is there for thine anger. Surely they walk moſt ſafely, that finding the Holy Scriptures a perfect rule, able to furniſh a man to every good work, keep cloſe to that, and dare not in practice admit any thing but what they find there commanded or practiſed. Thou owneſt the Holy Scriptures as thy rule? Why art thou offended that another keepeth cloſer to it then thou doſt?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider <hi>you are a great cauſe of the Spouſes appearing black.</hi> She is reproached for the contentious diviſions, and Schiſms that are in it; who are the cauſe of them? thoſe that keep to the rule of Gods Word, or thoſe that depart from it? Surely the whiteneſs, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of any Church lieth in its adherence to the Divine Rule, the more a particular Chriſtian, or any ſociety of Chriſtians, keep cloſe to the pattern which Chriſt and his Apoſtles have ſet them, and to the rule which God hath given them, the more pure, the more white and comely they are, Their deviation from it is their black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſo are thoſe contentions, and diviſions which ariſe in the Church, becauſe of thoſe deviations; it is a dreadful text, 1 Cor. 3. 17. <hi>If any man defile the Temple of God, him ſhall God deſtroy.</hi> The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle is there ſpeaking with reference to the Bodies of Profeſſors, which he had called the <hi>Temple of God.</hi> But it is as true concerning the Church of God, that is the <hi>Temple of God,</hi> this is <hi>deſtroyed,</hi> or <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed,</hi> for the word may be tranſlated by either of theſe words. God (ſaith the Apoſtle) will deſtroy him; who are they that <hi>defile the Church,</hi> and indeed deſtroy it, but thoſe that are the cauſe of ſcandals in it, either of its being black, or of its appearing black unto the World?</p>

               <p>Laſtly, You that are the ſincerer part of the Church, and have heard that you muſt expect that your Mothers Children ſhould be angry with you; that there ſhould be ſome <hi>bad fiſh in the drag-net with the good,</hi> ſome <hi>Tares</hi> in Chriſts Field of Wheat, ſome that will be ſpots in your Aſſemblies, and that theſe, if they do not make you black, yet will make you appear black; what remaineth, but that you take care that neither the <hi>luſts</hi> of your own hearts, which are (in a ſenſe) your Mothers Children, make you <hi>black,</hi> nor the oppoſition that you will meet with from ſuch as are falſe Brethren, make you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear more black then indeed you are.

Thence you read that the General of the <hi>Aſſyrian Army,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 25. 12. left <hi>of the poor of the Land to be the Dreſſers of the Vineyards;</hi> and thoſe in the Parable who had <hi>laboured in the Vineyard,</hi> told their Lord, that they had born the heat of the day. Thus the ſenſe is, <hi>I have been too much intangled in ſecular affairs;</hi> that hath been the cauſe of my blackneſs. 2. Others un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the term Vineyard in a <hi>metaphorical ſenſe.</hi> God uſeth the term to ſignifie his Church, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5. 1, 2, 3. As <hi>God</hi> hath a <hi>Vineyard,</hi> ſo <hi>Idolaters</hi> and <hi>ſuperſtitious perſons</hi> had <hi>their Vineyards.</hi> Moſt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Nations having ſome notions of a God, have had ſome <hi>Worſhip of a Deity,</hi> and wanting the guidance of holy Writ, grew vain in their own imaginations; hence came <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Superſtition;</hi> the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> having lived many years in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and in their paſſage through the Wilderneſs, converſing with the <hi>Moabites,</hi> and <hi>Midia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,</hi>

and not driving out all the <hi>Canaanites</hi> out of the promiſed Land, by converſe with them, learned to know, and to ſerve their gods, as you ſhall read in their whole ſtory, in the Books of <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Chronicles;</hi> there being a corrupt as well as a ſincerer part, in the Jewiſh Church, the corrupter part, impoſed upon the whole, the Idolatrous and Superſtitious Worſhip, and Rites of theſe Nations. This is the ſenſe into which the <hi>Chaldee Paraphraſt</hi> interpreteth theſe words. I am not apt to think this the ſenſe, but more incline to the former; yet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> ſhall not wholly paſs it over, partly becauſe the <hi>Chaldee Paraphraſt</hi> is a very antient Interpreter; and partly becauſe that ſenſe carries a truth in it. Hence ariſe two Propoſitions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop. 1.</hi> That a ſubmiſſion to falſe Worſhip, and Superſtitious Rites in the Service of God, will make the Spouſe of Chriſt appear black.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop. 2.</hi> That great entanglements in ſecular affairs, will make the Spouſe of Chriſt black.</p>
               <p>I ſhall ſpeak ſhortly to the firſt, and more largely to the ſecond, which I rather think to be the ſenſe. The Church of God hath three things committed to her truſt; the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> the <hi>Ordinances</hi> of <hi>Worſhip:</hi> The <hi>Rules of Diſcipline.</hi> The admiſſion of corruption in any of theſe, maketh a Church black, as it is a breach of truſt, and a <hi>deviation from the Divine Rule.</hi> This is <hi>ſufficiently</hi> proved by the meſſage Chriſt ſent to the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia.</hi> He let the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> know, that <hi>he had ſomething againſt her, becauſe ſhe had left her firſt love, Rev.</hi> 2. 4. <hi>v.</hi> 13. He reflecteth upon the Church of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> becauſe ſhe had thoſe in her, who held the <hi>Doctrine of Balaam,</hi> and of the <hi>Nicolaitans, v.</hi> 20. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecteth on the Church of <hi>Thyatira, for ſuffering the woman</hi> Jezabel <hi>to ſeduce the Servants of God, to commit fornication, and to eat things offered to Idols.</hi> Nor is any thing plainer in the whole ſtory of the Jewiſh Church, than that the admiſſion of corruption in the <hi>Worſhip and Order of that Church,</hi> was that which made it black and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, and look unlovely in the Eyes of God, and was at laſt the cauſe of its ruine and deſtruction. But becauſe Chriſtians may not ſo diſtinctly underſtand either wherein the <hi>Nature of Worſhip</hi> lies, or wherein the difference lieth betwixt that which is <hi>true, and falſe,</hi> I ſhall in a few Concluſions lay down what I conceive to be truth in this caſe, and then paſs on to the handling of the <hi>Propoſition</hi> ariſing from the other ſenſe of the words.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Worſhip is an homage performed to God immediately, in conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his Excellency.</hi> This is <hi>Aquinas</hi>'s, and other of the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:61084:287"/>
notion about <hi>Worſhip,</hi> and it is a very good one.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This <hi>homage</hi> is either the <hi>homage</hi> of the <hi>outward,</hi> or <hi>inward man.</hi> The homage of the inward man lieth in the exerciſes of our <hi>Faith, Love, Fear,</hi> the exerciſe of our thoughts upon God, admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him, &amp;c. But that which the Scripture calleth <hi>Worſhip</hi> moſt ordinarily, is ſome <hi>external acts</hi> teſtifying that <hi>inward homage,</hi> and <hi>ſubmiſſion of the heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Theſe acts are either ſuch as the Light of Nature directeth, and the Law of Nature obligeth us unto, or ſuch as God hath preſcribed us in his Word. Worſhip</hi> being in the general nature of it, nothing but an external homage done to God, in teſtification of the inward, and more ſecret homage and ſubjection of our Soul. It is the moſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable thing imaginable, that God <hi>ſhould preſcribe it;</hi> this he hath done as the <hi>God of Nature,</hi> imprinting a Law in our hearts, obliging us to call upon him for good things we want, and to <hi>praiſe him</hi> for good things received, partly <hi>in his holy Writ.</hi> There is no <hi>natural Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> but is alſo <hi>inſtituted,</hi> but there is much <hi>inſtituted Worſhip,</hi> which the Light of Nature doth not ſhew, nor the Law of Nature oblige us to, ſuch as <hi>Reading the Scriptures, hearing the Word Preached,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating in the holy Sacraments.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>External acts of Worſhip,</hi> that depend meerly upon <hi>Inſtitution,</hi> muſt be either <hi>inſtituted by Chriſt,</hi> or by our own <hi>wills,</hi> or the <hi>wills of others, Col.</hi> 2. 23. there is a <hi>Will-worſhip</hi> mentioned.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>All true Divine Worſhip muſt have a Divine Inſtitution.</hi> What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is pretended as an immediate act of homage to the <hi>Divine Being,</hi> and is not directed by <hi>Nature,</hi> and <hi>directed</hi> alſo, and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed</hi> and <hi>regulated</hi> by the Revelation of the Divine Will in the Word of God, is what we call <hi>Falſe Worſhip,</hi> or <hi>Will-Worſhip.</hi> As the firſt Commandment directeth our <hi>homage to God,</hi> as the alone <hi>true Object,</hi> ſo the ſecond directeth the <hi>manner of it,</hi> to be according to his revealed Will; for certainly that Commandment muſt not be interpreted as meerly prohibiting the <hi>Worſhip of God</hi> by, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a <hi>graven Image,</hi> or the ſimilitude of a thing, on purpoſe ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, either as <hi>repreſentative</hi> of the <hi>Divine Being,</hi> or as a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi> by which we worſhip God, but as <hi>prohibiting all other Modes, Acts and Methods</hi> which have no more of a Divine Inſtitution than that hath, only that one inſtance is given, and under it the other included. So that a <hi>graven Image</hi> is but <hi>ſpecies pro genere,</hi> and thoſe that worſhip God before a painted Image, or any other way which God hath not preſcribed, are alſo tranſgreſſors of that ſecond
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:61084:288"/>
Commandment. Hence it is obſervable, that God directed the <hi>Jews</hi> not only every <hi>Act</hi> by which an homage was paid to him, but alſo every Rite and Ceremony, and it was guilt enough for the <hi>Jews</hi> in his Worſhip to do that which <hi>he commanded them not. Uzziah</hi> muſt not offer Incenſe, nor <hi>Saul</hi> Sacrifice, nor <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> make uſe of <hi>ordinary fire,</hi> nor <hi>Uzzah</hi> carry the Ark upon a <hi>Cart, nor touch it.</hi> The ſame we conceive to be the will of God in the New Teſtament, God being a Spirit, and to be worſhipped by us in <hi>Spirit and in Truth,</hi> as well as by the <hi>Jews;</hi> and it ſeemeth the moſt reaſonable thing imaginable, 1. Conſidering <hi>that our Worſhip</hi> in its ſelf is a pitiful thing, infinitely diſproportioned to the perfection and excellency of God, ſo as it <hi>deriveth all its value from the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inſtitution.</hi> 2. And being an homage done to God, it is moſt reaſonable that God himſelf ſhould direct what he will accept. 3. Nor is it to be imagined, had God left man in the caſe to his own conduct and direction, how vain and various man would have been. 4. Beſides, it is not reaſonable to think that the holy Scriptures ſhould be a leſs perfect Rule in matters of Worſhip, than it is in matters of Doctrine, or that concern our ordinary courſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, or that acts of Worſhip, as to which it appeareth in all the Scripture, that God had a <hi>ſpecial jealouſie,</hi> and in which we are ſaid to <hi>draw nigh to God,</hi> ſhould be none of thoſe good works, as to which the holy Scriptures are ſufficient to furniſh every good man.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Divine Worſhip being an <hi>humane act,</hi> and that of the moſt noble nature, as it muſt have ſuch circumſtances as are neceſſary to all humane acts, (ſuch are <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Place;)</hi> ſo it is reaſonable that it ſhould have ſuch <hi>circumſtances</hi> as ſuit ſuch acts, ſo as they may be performed in ſuch manner as the <hi>Light of Nature,</hi> and <hi>common guiſe</hi> and <hi>cuſtom</hi> of Countries ſhall not determine, ſordid, filthy, or <hi>inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,</hi> and ſuch as may render it uſeful, and more profitable and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous, and anſwering to their ends, which <hi>circumſtances,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neceſſary to the acts as humane acts; or at leaſt plainly <hi>expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient,</hi> to avoid the indecent and ſordid performance of the acts, or for the more <hi>profit</hi> and <hi>advantage</hi> of the acts, and ſuch as in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the variety of Countries, the Cuſtoms and Uſages of them, &amp;c. could not be determined by the Word of God, muſt be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by the Governours of Churches, Nations, or Kingdoms, but ſtill with reſpect to the general ends of the action. But for any things uſed in the <hi>Worſhip of God,</hi> neither directed by <hi>Nature,</hi> nor yet by <hi>holy Writ,</hi> and appropriated to the <hi>Worſhip of God,</hi> as a <hi>Religious act,</hi>
                  <pb n="567" facs="tcp:61084:288"/>
out of a reſpect to the excellency of the <hi>Divine Being,</hi> and as an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to it, I cannot ſee how they can be lawful, they muſt have ſomething of the nature of Worſhip in them, and having ſo, they ought to have a <hi>Divine Inſtitution,</hi> without which I cannot ſee how they ſhould avoid the guilt of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> or <hi>Superſtition,</hi> which differ thus. If the faileur reſpect the <hi>Object,</hi> either <hi>terminatively,</hi> where the creature is made the <hi>term</hi> and <hi>ultimate Object,</hi> as in <hi>Ahab</hi>'s Idolatry, and the <hi>Papiſts Adoration</hi> of the <hi>Bread</hi> in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> or <hi>mediately,</hi> as in <hi>Jeroboam's caſe,</hi> and the <hi>Jews,</hi> relating to the <hi>golden Calf,</hi> or <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cab</hi>'s; all which worſhipped the <hi>true God,</hi> though by an <hi>Image,</hi> and uſing an Image as a mean of their Worſhip (as the Papiſts now do in their <hi>Veneration of their Images)</hi> This is <hi>Idolatry,</hi> called in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>Whoredom,</hi> ſpiritual Whoredom; and as <hi>Adultery</hi> in marriage, ſo this is the higheſt ſin can be committed in Worſhip, and which God hath more ſeverely puniſhed at all times, than any other ſins People have been guilty of. If the faileur reſpect the <hi>Acts,</hi> or the manner; if it be only internal, it is <hi>Hypocriſie,</hi> if in the <hi>external Acts</hi> or <hi>Manner,</hi> it is <hi>Superſtition,</hi> (ſuch are the <hi>Papiſts Salt Oil, Cream, Spittle,</hi> ſuperadded to the Inſtitution for <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and an hundred other Rites and Ceremonies uſed in all parts of their <hi>Worſhip.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. It is very obſervable, that <hi>from the beginning of the Church there hath been a ſtrange Itch in men,</hi> to be adding and mixing their own fancies, inventions, and Will-worſhip with the true <hi>Worſhip of God.</hi> God gave unto <hi>Moſes</hi> the <hi>particular Rule,</hi> and <hi>Law of his Worſhip;</hi> he communicated it to the People. <hi>David</hi> added to it, but no more than God by his Spirit directed, as appeareth, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28. 19. <hi>All this,</hi> ſaid <hi>David, the Lord made me to underſtand by his hand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, in writing.</hi> If you would know what that was, <hi>v.</hi> 12, 13. <hi>The Pattern of all that he had by the Spirit, of the Courts of the Houſe of the Lord, and of all the Chambers round about, of the Treaſuries of the Houſe of God, and of the Treaſuries of the dedicate things alſo for the courſes of the Prieſts and Levites, and for all the work of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Houſe of the Lord:</hi> Texts of Scripture which they are not aware of, who bring in <hi>David</hi> as an inſtance of a <hi>Prince,</hi> who added new <hi>Acts,</hi> or <hi>Modes,</hi> or <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> in the Worſhip of God. <hi>David</hi> ordered no more than the Lord had made him to underſtand in writing, by his Spirit, and by his hand upon him. One would think that mens common reaſon ſhould judge it ſafeſt to keep to the Divine Rule, and that it ſhould be the eaſieſt thing. But ſo vain hath man been in all Ages, that you ſhall find they could never
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:61084:289"/>
content themſelves with that Rule, but as if they had had a mind to pull down the Vengeance of God upon them, they were continually deviſing new <hi>waies</hi> and <hi>methods,</hi> after the example of other <hi>Nations,</hi> and copying out their Idolatries and Superſtitions. The <hi>Jews</hi> muſt make a golden Calf in imitation of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> then they fall in with the Idols of the <hi>Moabites. Micah</hi> muſt have an Image. <hi>Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi> muſt ſet up <hi>Calves</hi> at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel.</hi> In ſhort, this was the conſtant vanity of the <hi>Jews</hi> to all reaſonable mens juſt admiration. Chriſt left us a perfect Rule for Worſhip under the New <hi>Teſtament.</hi> But how ſoon was the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> in matter of Worſhip, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed aſide from the <hi>ſimplicity</hi> of the Goſpel. It kept <hi>Doctrine</hi> in good degrees of Purity, for five hundred years after Chriſt, but the Purity of Worſhip was abated in many places within leſs than three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years, and every Age ſtill grew worſe and worſe, till the <hi>Pope</hi> got into the Saddle, and then that <hi>Pope</hi> was no body who could not think upon one trifle or other to be added to the <hi>Rituals of Worſhip:</hi> Till the <hi>Popiſh Worſhip</hi> came up to be what it is at this day, a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Paganiſh, Jewiſh,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian Rites.</hi> And it is a very hard thing for any who readeth the Goſpel, and obſerveth Chriſt's Rules, and the Apoſtles Practice and Rules for <hi>Worſhip</hi> and <hi>Ordinances,</hi> to find any thing amongſt them which hath upon it Chriſt and the Apoſtles <hi>Stamp</hi> and <hi>Impreſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>In all times this hath been a temptation to ſincere Profeſſors, and many both Miniſters and People, individual Believers and Churches, to deviate from the Divine Rule.</hi> Either the Commands of Superiours have prevailed, (as in <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s time) it is laid to the charge of the <hi>Iſraelites, Hoſ.</hi> 5. 11. <hi>That they willingly followed the Commandment.</hi> (It is like ſome not very willingly neither, but the more of their will was in it, the greater the guilt was, and they are chiefly blamed) ſo <hi>Micah</hi> 6. 16. The <hi>Statutes of</hi> Omri <hi>are kept.</hi> Or elſe the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of their Leaders in <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>State</hi> have had the force of a Law upon them: Or the <hi>gaudry</hi> or <hi>ſpecious pretences</hi> made for things introduced, have had a force upon them. Many things ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving as (the Apoſtle ſaith) <hi>a ſhew of Wiſdom, and Will worſhip, and a neglecting of the body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. And laſtly, <hi>When theſe things have happened, they have been the blackneſs and pollution of thoſe Souls, and thoſe Churches that have been ſo far prevailed upon. Black</hi> and <hi>white</hi> in this caſe muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined and adjudged from a ſtrict adherence to, or a deviation from the Divine Rule. Thoſe that are brought over to ſuch <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliances,</hi>
                  <pb n="569" facs="tcp:61084:289"/>
have diſcoloured themſelves more or leſs, according to the degree wherein they have offended. They have <hi>kept others Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards,</hi> but <hi>their own they have not kept.</hi> The truſt which their <hi>Lord and Maſter</hi> committed to them, as to the <hi>Ordinances</hi> of <hi>Worſhip,</hi> they have not kept. 1. Theſe things bring a <hi>blackneſs</hi> and <hi>unlovelineſs</hi> upon the Soul, or upon a Church <hi>in the Eyes of God, and of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> He may not preſently give them a Bill of Divorce, and ſay unto them, they are not his People, but he looks upon them with an ill Eye, as a <hi>ſpeckled Bird,</hi> Jer. 12. 9. <hi>Mine Inheritance</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>is become unto me as a ſpeckled Bird;</hi> they kept ſomething of <hi>Divine</hi> impreſſions and inſtitutions, but they were <hi>ſpeckled;</hi> they had ſome colours fetched from the <hi>Moabites,</hi> and <hi>Ammonites,</hi> and <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtins,</hi> &amp;c. It is his will that thoſe who worſhip him, ſhould worſhip him according to his will, <hi>in Spirit,</hi> and <hi>in Truth</hi> (ſuch the Father ſeeketh to worſhip him) now theſe things ſpoil the truth of <hi>Divine Worſhip</hi> (which muſt be meaſured from a Divine Inſtitution:) And they ſpoil the ſpirituality of it, reducing <hi>Carnal Ordinances,</hi> and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them up inſtead of the <hi>Spiritual Worſhip</hi> of God. Such indeed the <hi>Jews</hi> had for a time, as you read, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 10. but they were to hold no longer, than <hi>until the time of Reformation.</hi> The Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worſhip was to be <hi>excluſive,</hi> not only of <hi>Ordinances</hi> that were <hi>typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi> prefiguring a better and moſt excellent Sacrifice and Service, which were fulfilled the <hi>Antitypes</hi> being come, but it was alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive of <hi>Carnal Ordinances,</hi> ſuch as were pleaſing and gratifying to the fleſh and outward man. The Worſhip of God according to Chriſt's Inſtitution, was to be more reaſonable, plain and ſpiritual. 2. Nay, Errours in the matters of the Worſhip of God, do not only defile, and make the Soul guilty, but exceeding guilty. Errours of Worſhip look like controulments of the Divine Wiſdom, who ſent his Son, and his Apoſtles to eſtabliſh a Rule of Worſhip. Theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditaments ſpeak the Eſtabliſht Rule imperfect, for otherwiſe they muſt be idle and ſuperfluous, nothing of which nature is to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in ſo grave and ſacred an action. The Aſſertion of the Divine Rule as not perfect in the matter of Worſhip, reflecteth upon our Saviour either as <hi>not knowing</hi> what it is that in worſhip would be moſt acceptable to his Father, or as not <hi>faithful in the Houſe of God.</hi> Or finally, as careleſly leaving things of that nature to the wills and fancies of men, as whoſe wildneſs even from the beginning of the world to that time, had ſhewed it ſelf in nothing more. But beſides, how can we better meaſure the greatneſs of any guilt, than by the
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:61084:290"/>
                  <hi>Revelations of God's will and wrath againſt it,</hi> and in reference to it. If you obſerve the Old Teſtament throughout from the time of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> coming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to their coming out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> you fhall find the will of God fully revealed againſt no one ſin, or kind of ſin like this of corruption, and faileurs in the matter of his Worſhip, ſo as ſuch Souls muſt needs be black in the Eyes of Chriſt, becauſe guilty, and that not in an ordinary degree.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hence alſo theſe things have made them black <hi>in the Eyes of the ſincerer part of Chriſtians.</hi> Thus doubtleſs were the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in <hi>Jeroboam's time,</hi> not only to the men of <hi>Judah,</hi> who adhered to the true Worſhip of God, and the ſincerer part of the Ten Tribes, who left them, and came to <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> to <hi>worſhip:</hi> But the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in <hi>Ahab</hi>'s times, in the ſight of <hi>Elijah,</hi> and thoſe ſeven thouſand whom God told <hi>Elijah,</hi> he had at that time in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who had not <hi>bowed their knee to</hi> Baal, <hi>nor kiſſed him with their lips.</hi>

But it will be demonſtratively clear to us, if we conſider either how much of our time the world will take up, or how much of our ſtrength and ſpirits, how it will diſtract and divide us; how much it will allure and intice us, or to how many ſcandals it will expoſe us. Of all theſe I ſhall ſpeak a word or two.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I ſay firſt, if we conſider how <hi>much of our time worldly occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions take up.</hi> All humane actions require <hi>time</hi> as well as <hi>place.</hi> There is no religious action, but requireth time, and the more time is ſpent in our worldly employments, the leſs muſt, or can be ſpent in religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous duties, the more our intanglements are in ſecular affairs, the leſs time we muſt ſpend in the acts of our more immediate homage to God; Alaſs, how little time hath he who is much imployed in the world, for reading, hearing, praying, for any religious ſervice, and this is the ordinary plea that men make for the non-performance of them, they have no time to read the Scriptures, or to pray in their Families, or to inſtruct them, or to hear the Word, or to imploy their thoughts upon ſpiritual things. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith of the <hi>covetous man, that the multitude of his riches will not let him ſleep.</hi> It may be ſaid of others, the multitude of their buſineſſes will not let them pray, or keep up any courſe of Religion in their Families, it ſuffers but a few to ſpend the Lords Sabbath as they ought to do, they are ſo far from ſparing God any of their own time, that they are more ready to ſteal his time, though it be but one day of ſeven.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, Worldly buſineſſes do not only take up much of our time, but alſo much <hi>of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> ſpirits and ſtrength,</hi> God doth not only require our <hi>love,</hi> and ſuch acts of homage in teſtification of our love as he hath preſcribed, but alſo that we ſhould <hi>love him,</hi> and do thoſe acts with <hi>all our hearts, with all our might, and ſtrength;</hi> and exceſs of worldly labour, and buſineſs, waſts our Spirits, takes away that might, and ſtrength which we fhould ſpend in the ſervice of God. <hi>Ah</hi> what heartleſs, lifeleſs prayers, and religious duties are performed by men and women taken up with an undue proportion of ſecular imployments?</p>

                  <pb n="572" facs="tcp:61084:291"/>
3. Thirdly, They fill the head with a <hi>multitude of diſtractions,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 35. The Apoſtle upon this account, <hi>v.</hi> 34. commendeth a <hi>ſingle life</hi> to thoſe to whom God had given that gift, for, ſaith he, <hi>The unmarried Woman careth for the things of the Lord, that ſhe may be holy, both in Body and Spirit: but the married Woman careth for the things of the World, that ſhe may pleaſe her Husband. And this</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I ſpeak to you for your own profit, not that I might caſt a ſnare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that you may attend upon the Lord, without diſtraction.</hi> Diſtractions in religious ſervices, though they appear not to the world, yet really are the blackneſs of the Soul, and it is our duty (as much as in us lyeth) to ſerve the Lord with the greateſt attention of our thoughts, and with as few diſtractions as we can; now the more we are incumbred with ſecular affairs, the greater we ſhall find our diſtractions in the ſervice of God. For, as it is upon the ringing of a Bell, though the man's hand be off the Rope, and the Bell begins to be ſtill, yet for ſome time we ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern a din in the ſides of the Bell, cauſed from its former motion and agitation: So will every obſerving Chriſtian find, that when his hand is off his ſecular buſineſs, yet his head will for ſome time be working upon it; and this more eſpecially ſheweth a <hi>preparation</hi> of heart neceſſary for thoſe in particular, who are much imployed in worldly buſineſs, before they draw nigh to God in the Solemn Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his Worſhip, that the noiſe of their ſecular affairs may be out of their heads, and they may ſerve the Lord without <hi>diſtractions,</hi> and not be like to the People, whom God complaineth of, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 31. <hi>They ſaid come, and let us go and hear the Word of the Lord.</hi> And (ſaith God) <hi>they come unto thee as the People cometh, and ſit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee as my People, and they hear thy words, but they will not do them; for with their mouths they ſhew much love, but their heart goeth after their covetouſneſs.</hi> Chriſt (in the Parable of the <hi>Sower) compareth ſome hearers of the Word to the ground that received the Seed amongſt Thorns, the cares of the world, and the deceitfulneſs of riches choked the Word, and made it become unfruitful.</hi> It is a great blackneſs of a Chriſtian, not to have his heart with God in Religious Services, ſo as the Lord (as the <hi>Prophet</hi> expreſſeth it) <hi>is nigh in his mouth, and far from his reins,</hi> and it is a <hi>blackneſs</hi> that will cover the face of every man and woman that converſeth too much with the world. <hi>Paul</hi> therefore rightly adviſeth the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that they ſhould uſe the world in a careleſs manner, that thoſe that <hi>rejoyced</hi> in the affluences of it, ſhould be <hi>as if they rejoyced not,</hi> and thoſe
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:61084:291"/>
that bought, <hi>as if they poſſeſſed not,</hi> and <hi>thoſe that uſed the world, as not abuſing it.</hi> But (ſaith he) I would have you without <hi>carefulneſs,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 30, 31, 32.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Worldly <hi>imployments</hi> have often an ill influence upon Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, to <hi>intice, and allure them to ſin,</hi> not only by omiſſions of duty, but by the commiſſions of things which are contrary to their duty, there is a ſenſible ſweetneſs in worldly enjoyments, and thoſe are the product of worldly buſineſs and imployment. The Devil baiteth all his Hooks with ſome piece of the World or other. Some with the ſenſibly ſweet part of it, ſome with the gay, and ſplendid part of it, ſome with the richer, and more profitable part of it. It is an hard thing for Chriſtians to keep Vineyards, and not drink ſome of that intoxicating Wine which is the fruit of them. When <hi>Samuel</hi> gave up his account as a <hi>Judge,</hi> in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 3. <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>here I am, witneſs againſt me before the Lord—whoſe Ox have I taken, or whoſe Aſs have I taken, or whom have I defrauded, whom have I oppreſſed, or of whoſe hand have I received any bribe? Paul</hi> in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner thus acquitteth himſelf to the <hi>Church of Epheſus,</hi> Acts 20. 33. <hi>I have coveted no Mans Silver, or Gold, or Apparel.</hi> But ſhew me the Man or Woman that hath been much incumbred with worldly affairs, and can ſay; <hi>I have coveted no Mans Houſe, or Land, or Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, or Gold;</hi> or that can ſay; To whom have I told a lie for my gain, or ſaid it hath coſt me ſo much, when indeed it did not? Or whom have I done injuſtice to in a bargain? Commonly the beſt of the Market which ſuch Chriſtians have, is that of <hi>Zacheus, Luke</hi> 19. <hi>If I have taken any thing from any man by unjuſt dealings, I reſtore him fourfold.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Laſtly, <hi>A too great incumbrance with the world, leaves a blot upon Chriſtians in the common repute of the world,</hi> if they eſcape real blots from it. Holy Men in the Greek are called <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>

                  <hi>diſadvantage we have all received from the fall of Adam.</hi> It was a curſe which upon the fall fell upon all the Poſterity of <hi>Adam,</hi> Gen. 3. 19. <hi>In the ſweat of thy face thou ſhalt eat thy Bread, till thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the ground.</hi> I do not think that if man had continued in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, he ſhould have lived idly, but <hi>Mercers</hi> opinion is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, his labour ſhould rather have been for delight, then for neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, or rather, his labour ſhould not have been ſo great, as now it is; the <hi>Thorns</hi> and <hi>Thiſtles</hi> which the ground now naturally brings forth, and in the prevention, and extirpation of which the labour of the Husbandman is ſo much, were clearly the effect of the curſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Earth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 18. a lively-hood for the Sons of Men had doubtleſs been got at a cheaper rate, with leſſer labour, and man had been at a great deal more liberty, and leiſure for a communion with God, and have had more time for his immortal Soul, then his world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly occaſions will now permit, or allow. This may be a profitable meditation for the poorer ſort of Chriſtians, whom the need of Bread for themſelves, and the want of a juſt proviſion for their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, reſtrain from ſpending ſo much time in communion with God as they would, to ſit down, and think of the woful effect, and fruit of the ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> that firſt ſin of man, which reduced the Sons and Daughters of men to theſe miſerable neceſſities.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Uſe 2.</note> Secondly, Obſerve from hence, <hi>what an advantage thoſe have, whom the liberal hand of Divine Providence hath delivered from ſuch a miſerable ſervitude to ſecular affairs.</hi> If they will make themſelves ſlaves, and drudges to the World, they may, but the Providence of God hath not put them upon any neceſſity ſo to do. God hath given them Eſtates to live upon, Servants to toil for them. I will but offer two things to the conſideration of theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>How inexcuſable will you be if you do not keep your own Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards well?</hi> Your own Vineyards are your Souls, thoſe immortal Subſtances, ordained to an Eternity, ennobled with Reaſon, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny gifts and faculties, by which, if you will, you may bring forth much fruit to the honour and glory of God; if now you be not found mighty in the Scriptures, much in reading, hearing, prayer, cloſe in your walking with God, &amp;c. You cannot plead that you want leiſure: A morning and evening Service God under the Law required, and in the ſame proportion doubtleſs under the Goſpel, though not by way of Sacrifice properly ſo called. I obſerve of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> that they prayed thrice in a day, <hi>Pſal</hi> 55. 17. <hi>Evening, and morning, and at noon will I pray, and cry aloud</hi> (ſaith
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:61084:292"/>
                  <hi>David.)</hi> Of <hi>Daniel</hi> we read, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. 10. that <hi>he kneeled three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks unto God, as he did before-time.</hi> They were both <hi>great men,</hi> and at more leiſure than ordinary <hi>Jews.</hi> they conſidered this; and as God had doubled their portions, ſo they thought it reaſonable in ſome meaſure to proportion their duties to their circumſtances.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, <hi>Conſider how little you will have to ſay, if you ſo far intangle your ſelves in the world, as it becometh a ſnare to your Souls.</hi> Who pitieth him that is burned, who for meer wantonneſs puts his finger in the fire? Hath God given us <hi>food</hi> and <hi>rayment? Jacob</hi> begged no more. The Apoſtle commandeth us, if we have ſo much, to be <hi>therewith content.</hi> It is an excellent Exhortation which the Apoſtle hath given, and thoſe are eſpecially capable to receive to whom God hath given a plenty in this world, <hi>Heb,</hi> 13. 4. <hi>Let your converſation be without covetouſneſs, and be content with thoſe things which you have, for God hath ſaid, I will never leave nor forſake you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Uſe 3.</note> Let this <hi>caution us all</hi> (in the laſt place) <hi>to take heed how we keep Vineyards;</hi> how we make our ſelves drudges and ſlaves to ſecular imployments. Take heed of ſuch a Service to the world as is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with that duty and ſervice which you owe unto God. You cannot ſerve two Maſters, you cannot ſerve <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Mammon.</hi> Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer me to allude to that of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 9, 10. <hi>I wrote</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to you an Epiſtle, not to keep company with Fornicators, yet not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together with the Fornicaters of this world, or with the Covetous, or the Extortioners, or the Idolaters, for then you muſt go out of the world; But now I have wrote to you, not to keep company, if any Brother,</hi> &amp;c. I do but allude to the Text. <hi>Brethren,</hi> I have this day been ſpeaking to you to have a care of medling with the world, becauſe it waſts your time, ſpends your ſpirits, diſtracts your thoughts, allureth and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticeth you to the too much love of it, becauſe it will be a blot upon your Profeſſion, yet I would not be underſtood, as if I had been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuading you to the lives of lazy <hi>Monks,</hi> and <hi>Nuns,</hi> and <hi>Hermites;</hi> if you will have nothing to do with the world, you muſt not live in it. God hath commanded us <hi>in the ſweat of our face to eat our bread.</hi> The Apoſtle bids, that thoſe who would <hi>not labour, ſhould not eat,</hi> and hath told us, that he would have us to <hi>labour with our hands, that we might have ſomething to give to thoſe that want,</hi> and hath told us, that he who <hi>provideth not for his family is worſe than an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel,</hi> and hath <hi>denied the Faith.</hi> Only take heed how you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe

with it, that you be not by it defiled, that it takes not up too much of your time, nor waſts too much of your ſpirits and ſtrength; that it leadeth you not into temptation, diſtracteth not your hearts in holy duties. <hi>Keep thy foot when thou goeſt into the Houſe of God;</hi> look to your thoughts and affections, when you draw nigh unto God in holy ſervices and duties; uſe the world ſo, as thou mayeſt have time for <hi>Religious duties in thy family,</hi> and mayeſt not by thy worldly concerns, be diſtracted in them. I would ſpeak to you in this caſe, as <hi>Paul</hi> doth in the caſe of ſervitude to men, and of Marriage. Are you by the Providence of God looſed from the world? ſeek not to be bound to it. Do your neceſſities call, and for the preſent bind you to it? Till God by favourable Providence looſen you from it, do not looſen your ſelves by idleneſs and lazineſs. It is poſſible thou mayeſt be God's free-man, while thy neceſſities bind thee to worldly buſineſs. I confeſs thou haſt an hard task, but (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>Let every man in the Calling wherein, and whereto he is called, abide therein with God.</hi> Mark that laſt term, not <hi>without</hi> God, not in a neglect of his duty to God, but <hi>with God.</hi> Labour to have <hi>manum in clavo, oculos in coelo,</hi> to be in thy heart, thoughts and affections <hi>with God,</hi> whiles thou art imployed in thy lower buſineſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns in this life.</p>

               <p>THe Spouſe (by which I underſtand the Church of Chriſt, and every particular <hi>believing Soul</hi> that is a true member of it) is yet apologizing for her blackneſs, or appearing blackneſs, from the cauſes of it, three of which ſhe hath already aſſigned. 1. <hi>Her afflictions,</hi> or perſecutions. <hi>The Sun hath looked upon me.</hi> 2. Her oppoſition from <hi>falſe Brethren. My Mothers Children were angry with me.</hi> 3.

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The Spouſe had hitherto not much charged her ſelf, ſhe had charged her <hi>blackneſs</hi> upon her <hi>afflictions</hi> and <hi>Perſecutions,</hi> &amp; upon the <hi>oppoſition</hi> ſhe had met with from falſe Brethren, and upon her <hi>intanglement</hi> in <hi>Secular affairs,</hi> but was there no fault in her ſelf; here now ſhe comes to lay much of the blame up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her ſelf? <hi>My own Vineyard</hi> (faith ſhe) <hi>I have not kept.</hi> Gods diſpenſations of Providence to me (ſaith ſhe) have been ſome cauſe of my blackneſs: The oppoſition I have met with from falſe Brethren have yet been a greater cauſe, but the truth is (ſaith ſhe) notwithſtanding both theſe, had not the fault been my own, I had not been ſo black. I might have kept my Vineyard better then I have done. <hi>The</hi> truely gracious, and humble Soul will not as to its failings ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe it ſelf wholly. It may charge ſomething upon <hi>forreign cauſes</hi> out of its ſelf, either from <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Satan</hi> or men, but will not diſcharge its own naughty and corrupt heart. The hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite chargeth <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>Devil</hi> and <hi>men</hi> highly, but ſeldom chargeth himſelf, or if at all very faintly. The reaſon lyeth in the pride of his heart which will not ſuffer it to ſtoop ſo low as to give God glory, or to take any ſhame to its ſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, Obſerve what words they are which theſe words immediately follow, <hi>They made me the keeper of the Vineyards, but my own Vineyard I have not kept.</hi> The Soul that is too much abroad is ordinarily too little at home, he or ſhe that muſt have an Oar in every ones <hi>Boat</hi> ſeldom hath his own Boat well governed; Such a Soul is like the gadding houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife, whoſe own houſe rarely is well lookt after. This hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth eſpecially when the Soul is much abroad about ſecular concerns; the Soul though it be of a Spiritual nature, yet is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry capable of being laden with, and mired in <hi>thick Clay.</hi> No Soul is ſo careleſs of things of an Eternal concern, as thoſe Souls which are moſt careful and ſollicitous about things tranſitory, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing. There is a kind of inconſiſtency betwixt the buſineſs of the world, and the buſineſs of Heaven, the prefent world, and that which is to come, Nor is any Church ſo neglective of the <hi>Vineyard,</hi> with which God hath betruſted it, as that Church that hath bowed down to impoſitions of falſe worſhip.

and the <hi>Profeſſion of holineſs.</hi> 1. <hi>A profeſſion of faith,</hi> both of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of faith, and of <hi>the grace or habit of ſaith.</hi> It lyeth upon a Chriſtian to keep both. 2. The <hi>profeſſion of holineſs</hi> (which is indeed but the practice of faith, for that worketh by Love and the fruits of holineſs) muſt proceed from the root of faith. This is every Chriſtians <hi>Vineyard</hi> and indeed the Vineyard of his Soul, is not kept without the keeping of theſe. Hence <hi>David</hi> glorieth, that he <hi>kept the ways of the Lord, Pſal.</hi> 18. 21. <hi>Paul kept the faith,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 7. <hi>David</hi> kept the <hi>Lords teſtimonies,</hi> his Law, his Precepts, his Word, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 11. 9. 22, 55, 56, 67. The Church of <hi>Philadelphia</hi> is commended for keeping the Lords Word, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3. 8. The word of his patience, <hi>v.</hi> 20. This is the Vineyard of every Chriſtian according to the more publick or private ſtation which he hath in the Church of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Church of Chriſt</hi> hath a <hi>Vineyard</hi> alſo. Indeed the Church is her ſelf compared to a Vineyard, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5. and in the parable of him who let out his <hi>Vineyards to huſbandmen</hi> (but in that ſenſe Chriſt is himſelf the <hi>Keeper</hi> of it;) Onely he <hi>lets it out to huſbandmen,</hi> intruſting certain Officers of his own appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the managery of the affairs of it, but himſelf hath ſuch a Superintendency upon it, and ſo keepeth it, that <hi>the gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it.</hi> The Church hath a Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard to keep; what is this Vineyard, but the <hi>Doctrine of faith?</hi> The <hi>Ordinances</hi> of our great Lord for <hi>worſhip,</hi> and for <hi>diſcipline:</hi> Theſe are the Churches Vineyard. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of the Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſaith, that unto them were <hi>committed</hi> the <hi>Oracles of God,</hi> Rom. 3. 2. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, the diſpenſation of the Goſpel was <hi>committed</hi> unto him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9 17. The word of reconciliation is ſaid to be committed to the Miniſters of the Goſpel, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 19. The Goſpel was committed to Pauls <hi>truſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 11. Hence <hi>Timothy</hi> is ſpoken to to keep that which was <hi>committed to his truſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 20. The <hi>Church</hi> is therefore called, <hi>The pillar,</hi> and <hi>ground of truth,</hi> and is fitly compared to the Ark in which was laid up the <hi>Pot of Manna,</hi> ſignifying the word and truths of God. The <hi>two Tables</hi> containing the <hi>Laws for Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> and our more ordinary converſation, and the <hi>rod of Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> ſignifying the <hi>Government and diſcipline of the Church.</hi> The rules for theſe are laid up in the Church being part of thoſe Oracles of God which are committed to it. It is a task which God hath layed upon his Church to keep this <hi>Vineyard.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Qu. 2.</note> What it is to <hi>keep</hi> it we may eaſily gather from an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding what it is to keep a Vineyard or nurſery, or garden, &amp;c.

To keep it with digging, planting, manuring, dreſſing, and cultivating, that it may yield that fruit, and profit to the Owner which he expects from it, and for which he at firſt planted it. Hence then may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be concluded what it is both for a particular Chriſtian, and for a Church to keep its own <hi>Vineyard.</hi> The whole buſineſs lyeth in theſe 2 things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It ſignifieth <hi>a Chriſtians keeping of his Soul from Errors, and from luſts, and corruptions.</hi> All motions and inclinations to ſin, are the Souls Weeds, and what the Souls of the beſt of men are too prone to, its natural fruit; and <hi>Quod Sponte prodit laeti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> prodit,</hi> naturally Weeds grow faſter then induced plants. A par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Chriſtians care in keeping the Vineyard of his Soul lies in keeping his underſtanding and judgment untainted with <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour</hi> as to <hi>Doctrine,</hi> in keeping his <hi>will</hi> from cloſing with <hi>motions to ſin,</hi> whether from within, or without, and his <hi>conſcience ſprinkled from Evil works.</hi> So for the Church of Chriſt, her keeping her Vineyard lies in preſerving in all her members a <hi>purity of Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine</hi> in oppoſition to the impurity of <hi>corrupt opinions, and errors: A purity of Worſhip</hi> in oppoſition to all <hi>Superſtition</hi> and Will-Worſhip, and a purity of diſcipline.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, it implieth the Souls <hi>filling</hi> and furniſhing it ſelf with <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>Spiritual habits</hi> the plants which the Lord would have to ſtand, and to grow in all parts of his inheritance, and in every Soul that pretendeth any relation unto him. As the Gardiner, who is intruſted with the keeping of any of your Gardens doth not keep them as he ought, unleſs beſide the weeding of them, and purging them of Weeds and nettles, he alſo furniſheth them with uſeful plants and herbs, and keeps them duly cut and pruned, &amp;c. So neither doth that man or woman keep the Vineyard of his own Soul, that doth not take care to grow in Grace, and in the knowledge of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and in all other good, and vertuous habits. So as to the <hi>Church,</hi> that Church doth not keep its own Vineyard, that doth not beſides purging itſelf of errors, and ſcandals, take care alſo that the truths of God be duly preached, and publiſhed, and the

                  <hi>Ordinances</hi> of God purely adminiſtred. This is now for the Spouſe to keep, or not to keep her own Vineyard, now I ſay the <hi>Spouſe</hi> of Chriſt, whether the <hi>Individual</hi> Spouſe (which is every truly gracious Soul) or the <hi>collective Spouſe</hi> Which is the Church of God is very prone to neglect <hi>the keeping of its own Vineyard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Qu. 3.</note> This needeth no other Evidence, then the experience of all Chriſtians and all Churches, and that in all ages.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I ſay firſt the <hi>Experience of particular Chriſtians,</hi> for <hi>who</hi> liveth, <hi>and ſinneth not againſt God?</hi> The righteous falleth 7 times in a day; now though it be true, that many of the ſins of Gods people are ſins of <hi>pure infirmity;</hi> Either through <hi>ignorance</hi> or <hi>impotency,</hi> to reſiſt the temptation, yet both this ignorance and impotency are often occaſioned through a neglect, or not improvement of the means of knowledge and better infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and through our not preparing our ſelves to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual fight, putting on the whole Armor of God as we ought to have done; Avoiding occaſions to Sin, abſtaining from the appearances of Evil, and giving no advantage to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary; all which are our duties and enjoined us by the Apoſtle.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Nor Secondly either is there, or ever was any Church of God upon the Earth, that kept its own Vineyard as it ought to have done. The Church of the Jews was the only Church God had upon the Earth until the time of <hi>John the Baptiſt.</hi> Whoſoever readeth their ſtory, in the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Books of <hi>Kings and Chronicles,</hi> or in the Writings of the Prophets, will find that they did not keep their <hi>own Vineyard.</hi> Never had any Church a truſt more clearly committed to them, they could have no long diſputes about any thing of the revealed will of God, if any queſtion did ariſe they had an infallible rule, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. for the determination of it; yet (as I told you before) as the ten Tribes made a total defection after the reigns of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> both whoſe reigns made up but 80 years in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of which, (in <hi>Solomon's</hi> time,) towards the latter end of his Reign; they alſo admitted very great corruptions) ſo in the Kingdom of <hi>Judah</hi> they loſt what was committed to their truſt many times and ſeldom kept it 60 years together in any degrees of purity. So that in <hi>Joſiahs</hi> time the Book of the law was thrown about and hid in the rubbiſh, and found by the repairers of the houſe of the Lord, as you find in the ſtory of the Book of the <hi>Kings.</hi> Now that this was their moſt wilful
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:61084:296"/>
neglect, appeareth by their frequent reductions though not perfect, to the Divine rule. When <hi>Aſa, Jehoſaphat, Hezekiah, Joaſh, Joſiah,</hi> attempted it, and the plain revelation which they had of the will of God, both from the letter of the law, their way for deciſion of doubts about it, and the Prophets which God favoured them with, all the while that Kingdom remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. After that Church was deſtroyed, and the Chriſtian Church ſet up, all the <hi>Apoſtolical Epiſtles</hi> give a proof of the prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Churches to neglect the keeping of their own Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards, and of the Lords Watchmen to ſleep while the Enemy ſowed tares. The ſame is alſo Evidenced by all <hi>Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal hiſtory,</hi> and from the Hiſtory of all modern Churches, their Deviations in <hi>Doctrine, Worſhip &amp; Diſcipline,</hi> &amp;c. teſtify it.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Qu. 4.</note> Nor is the reaſon of this aptneſs in us to neglect the <hi>keeping of our own Vineyards,</hi> hard to be aſſigned.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt is <hi>the laboriouſneſs of the work, and the croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it to the genius of Fleſh and blood.</hi> For a Chriſtian to keep his heart with all diligence is no eaſy work, it lies much in a Chriſtians denial of himſelf, taking up the Croſs, mortifying his members, as to which, our fleſh inceſſantly cries in the language of <hi>Peter, Maſter, ſpare thy ſelf.</hi> So that he who doth it rows (as we ſay) both againſt wind and tide. It requires much knowledge and judgment to keep a mans ſelf unſpotted from errors, but a great degree of ſelf denial for any man to keep himſelf unſpotted from the pollution of the World through luſt; upon this account it is that our Saviour compareth the way <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o heaven to a narrow way, a ſtrait gate. And tells us that it is as eaſy for a Camel to go through the Eye of a Needle as for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God. Our work is compared by our Saviour to a cutting off the right hand, and plucking out of a right Eye. In works of great labour, and difficnlty, we are very prone (you know) to be remiſs, and negligent.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But this is not all; <hi>The native corruption and inclination in mans heart to deviate from the holy and right ways of God is a great cauſe.</hi> I muſt confeſs that as to the Churches keeping its Vineyard I cannot apprehend ſuch a difficulty in it. As to truth a man indeed cannot believe what he liſteth, but the Church notwithſtanding this may keep the <hi>Doctrine of ſaith;</hi> if parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Perſons that are otherwiſe perſuaded, in ſome points then
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:61084:296"/>
the reſt of the Church is, would but learn what the Apoſtle directs in that caſe; <hi>Haſt thou ſaith? have it to thy ſelf, Rom.</hi> 14. and not think themſelves obliged to publiſh to the diſturbance of a Church what is their own particular opinion. As to <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances</hi> relating to <hi>Worſhip and Government,</hi> what difficulty can there be in keeping ſtrictly to the <hi>Divine rule</hi> and doing that alone which Gods Word requireth? the queſtions concerning that would be very few, if men did not lay hold upon ſome gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral paſſages, and apply them to their own fancies. Were men but fixed in this to adhere to the Divine rule without diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, or without adding to it, unleſs in caſes where ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions are apparently neceſſary, certainly this were all to be required in order to the Churches keeping <hi>its own Vineyard</hi> as to the Ordinances committed to it. But the corruption of mans heart, inclining him to interpret the will of God in a conſiſtency to his own reaſon, makes all the difficulty in the Churches keeping the Doctrine of faith. And the wild humour that hath always poſſeſt men to Worſhip God according to their own fancies, and to create decencies, and matters of order, according to their own pleaſure, and to conform their Altars to that of <hi>Damaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> hath been all along in the ſtory of the Church, the cauſe of the Churches neglecting to keeps its proper <hi>Vineyard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, It is much cauſed from the <hi>mixture of the world in our converſation.</hi> This is true both as to the neglect of the particular Chriſtian, &amp; as to the neglect of the Church alſo. As to the particular Chriſtian; we are but fleſh, and have ſenſes to be gratified with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, profits, honour, &amp;c. as well as with the ſupply of our neceſſities: We live in, and converſe with the world, which is full of objects, that gratifie our ſenſitive appetite in theſe things; theſe are continual temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to us to remit at leaſt the care of our own ſouls, &amp; to neglect our own Vineyards. The Church alſo while it is militant here on Earth, &amp; conſidered as Viſible, hath in it a great <hi>mixture</hi> of the world, though not of the <hi>Pagen world,</hi> (there muſt be a profeſſion of Chriſt in all the Members of the Viſible Church) yet, of that <hi>world</hi> which <hi>lyeth in wickedneſs,</hi> and it is this mixture of <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> with ſuch as are the ſincere Servants of God, that cauſeth the Church's neglect of its <hi>Vineyard.</hi> All the remiſsneſs in a Church of its care as to the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, Worſhip,</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline of Chriſt,</hi> proceedeth from this mixture of perſons, who are no more than Viſible, with ſuch as are ſincere, and true Members of the Church of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="584" facs="tcp:61084:297"/>
4. A fourth cauſe of this neglect, is mens <hi>fooliſh preſumptions, that they are well enough.</hi> The work of every particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in keeping the Vineyard of his own Soul, is ſo contrary to the grain of fleſh, and blood, that not only the natural man, but even the <hi>Sanctified man</hi> (in regard of that corruption which is yet in him) is ready to take up with ſhort meaſures of it, and to think his <hi>Vineyard</hi> is well enough kept when indeed it is not; men are loth to be <hi>righteous over much,</hi> and are very apt to think that a little is enough. We are very apt to think that we do enough duty, and conſider not the mark which we are to preſs after, the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt. It is ſomething natural to us to think we may not only do, but over-do what God requireth of us, when alas! when we have done all we can we are unprofitable ſervants, <hi>ſervants,</hi> ſo that what we do is but our <hi>duty, unprofitable ſervants,</hi> ſo that what we do cometh much ſhort of our duty. <hi>Perfection</hi> is what we are all bound to aim at and ſtrive after, but withal it is what no man attaineth; not <hi>as though I had already attained, or were already per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle.) You know in works that are not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally pleaſing to us we are well pleaſed to think we have done enough. Thus it is in the buſineſs of <hi>Religion,</hi> and <hi>holineſs,</hi> they are things which <hi>pleaſe not fleſh and blood;</hi> ſo as we are well pleaſed when we can Satisfy our ſelves, and think that we need do no more nor go any further, and as it is with particular Chriſtians ſo it is with <hi>Churches,</hi> all which have not <hi>Paſtors, and Governours</hi> according to Gods own heart, nor are all the <hi>members</hi> of them, <hi>members of Chriſt.</hi> Now thoſe who are not ſo are no great lovers of, nor <hi>zealous</hi> for the perfection of purity, but can take up with meaſures ſhort of thoſe which Chriſt hath made, and given. Hence is that neglect of the keeping their own <hi>Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards</hi> which is but too obvious in all Churches; and hence are thoſe obvious declinations in that duty which men owe to God, and in the purity of Churches every Age is ſtill declining, and growing worſe then the former, whiles a party in the Church ſtill ſtudyeth more and more to wriggle their neck out of the yoke of Chriſt, and to get rid of ſome ingrateful things to fleſh and blood, which a former Age retained. For as no parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Perſon at firſt runs up to the higheſt degree of wickedneſs, ſo ſeldom doth any Church at firſt <hi>Apoſtatize,</hi> to that degree, but gradually declineth.</p>

Which way ſoever you conſider a Soul, whether as a <hi>Spiritual</hi> being, or as a <hi>reaſonable</hi> being, indued with noble faculties, or as an <hi>immortal being</hi> that cannot periſh with the body, as that part of man, which beareth the moſt lively impreſs of the image of God, as that which was <hi>purchaſed</hi> by the blood of Chriſt, and which is the habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God through the Spirit in which the holy Spirit may dwell, that which is ordained to an Eternity either of happineſs or miſery; which way ſoever you look upon your own Souls, or the Souls of thoſe who are committed to your truſts, they are noble Vineyards. Reaſon teacheth us to take the beſt care of our beſt and moſt excellent things, I have thought it often a moſt unreaſonable vanity of ſome Gentlemen, to take a great
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:61084:299"/>
deal more care of the managery, of an <hi>horſe</hi> or <hi>hawk</hi> then of their <hi>Sons.</hi> It is every whit as great, if not a much greater vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to take a greater care of the bodies, and <hi>outward concerns</hi> of their relations, then of their Souls. What can be laid in bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance with a Soul which will not be found too light for it? what ſhall be offered in exchange for it, and not rejected as of too low a conſideration? Of what value think you that muſt be which was bought with the blood of him who was the Son of God? Conſider of what value the profeſſion of your faith, and the practice of holineſs is; your faith is called <hi>precious</hi> faith, and of <hi>holineſs,</hi> it is ſaid that without it none ſhall ſee the Lord.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly. Conſider <hi>who it is that hath betruſted you with</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezek. 18. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>them. Behold</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>All Souls are mine,</hi> It is God that hath given unto us the <hi>truſt</hi> of our own Souls and the truſts of <hi>others Souls</hi> for all Souls are originally Gods. He <hi>breaths</hi> the Soul into the body of a man, he puts Souls into mens families, I beſeech you conſider here theſe particulars: 1. <hi>That every Perſon of reputation and honour valueth a truſt,</hi> and thinks it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath a man, not to diſcharge a truſt he undertakes with ſome degrees of faithfulneſs. We ſee in our daily experience, that as men naturally Love to be truſted, ſo they have a kind of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral religion, for the keeping and diſcharging of it. This is what makes men conſciencious as to the wills of Perſons that are dead. All Souls are <hi>truſts,</hi> our particular Souls are truſts, the Souls of our relations are truſts to us. The property of all Souls is Gods, the truſt of them is in us, I wiſh this were but well thought on; the wicked men mentioned by the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaid, <hi>our lips are our own, who is Lord over us? Pſal.</hi> 12. 4. men think that they may do what they will with what they have a full propriety in. This is a great cauſe of mens neglect of their Souls, they dream too much of an abſolute property they have in them, they ſay, their Souls are their own. <hi>Who is Lord over them?</hi> would men conſider their Souls a little more as truſts they would take a ſtricter care of them. 2. Tho <hi>we naturally</hi> value all truſts, yet ſuch as our <hi>Superiours or near friends com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to us we yet value more.</hi> A dread of our Superiours makes us to value and take care of what they have committed to our truſt a love to our friends makes us value theirs; our Souls, and the Souls of thoſe that are in relation to us, are a truſt commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us by the Lord of the whole Earth by Chriſt who hath
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:61084:299"/>
dyed for us. So that here is both the relation of a <hi>Superiour</hi> and of a <hi>friend</hi> in the caſe, obliging us to take a due care for the keeping of our Vineyards. 3. <hi>The more eyes we have upon us, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving how we manage our truſt, the more careful we are (ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) as to the managery of it.</hi> This is a truſt as to which God who hath entruſted us, hath an Eye to us how we diſcharge it; this needeth no great proof, whoſo believeth Gods Omniſciency, and conſidereth the obſerving Eye which God keepeth upon all men, and all their actions, ſo as they are all written in a Book, muſt know and believe this. Laſtly the more <hi>accountable we are for any truſt,</hi> the more we take our ſelves obliged to keep it with all diligence. The truſt of every mans Soul is a truſt for which he muſt account, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 12. So then <hi>every one of us ſhall give an account of himſelf unto God we muſt give an account to him who is ready to judge both the quick and the dead,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4 5. of what muſt we give an account, but of our <hi>Souls?</hi> their <hi>Elicit &amp; Imperate</hi> acts, the Apoſtle tells us that it is the duty of Paſtors and Governours of Churches, to <hi>watch for Souls</hi> becauſe they <hi>muſt give an account.</hi> Certainly it is as much the duty of every particular Chriſtian to watch over his own Soul, becauſe his Soul is a truſt, of which he muſt give an account to him that is <hi>ready to come to judge both the quick and the dead.</hi> Nor are we only to give an account of our Souls, but of the Souls committed to our charge. This the Apoſtle telleth us plainly, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17. as to thoſe who are Governors, and Paſtors of Churches, and God told it <hi>Ezechiel, Ezech.</hi> 3. 18. <hi>Son of</hi> man (ſaith he) I have made thee a watch-man to the houſe of <hi>Iſrael—v.</hi> 18. <hi>When I ſay unto the wicked thou ſhalt ſurely die, and thou giveſt him not warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor ſpeakeſt to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to ſave his Life, the ſame wicked man ſhall die in his iniquity, but his blood will I require at thy hand.</hi> (This is that which made <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> think that there were but a few Miniſters that would be ſaved.) But it is as true concerning <hi>Superiors</hi> in other relations; God never bringeth a wife into the boſom of any husband, nor addeth a Child or Servant to any family, but he ſaith to the husband of that wife, to the Parent of that Child or thoſe Children, to the Maſter of thoſe Servants, <hi>All Souls are mine. The Souls of theſe Perſons I commit to thy truſt, if thou doeſt not warn them from ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful courſes, if thou doeſt not walk towards them as a man of knowledge, and bring them up in the nurture, and admonition of the Lord, they</hi>
                  <pb n="590" facs="tcp:61084:300"/>
                  <hi>ſhall die in their ignorance, in their iniquity, but their Souls will I require at thy hand.</hi> A conſideration which if duly weighed by the Sons of men, would awaken men to another kind of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their families, and another kind of inſtruction of them then I fear is ordinarily to be found in families.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I ſhall add but one thing more; The better any man keepeth the Vineyard of his own Soul, or the <hi>Vineyard</hi> of his family, <hi>the more fruit he ſhall reap from it.</hi> His <hi>Vintage</hi> will be the better, there is little fruit to be expected from a <hi>neglected Vine.</hi> Our Vineyards, thoſe I mean of our own Souls and the Souls of others under our truſt, do not only bring forth fruit to the honour and Glory of God but unto our ſelves, and that very conſiderable, 1. In our <hi>peace of Conſcience</hi> here in this Life. 2. <hi>In that glory which is the object of our future hopes.</hi> The fruit of righteouſneſs is peace and quietneſs, and aſſurance for ever. Keep your Vineyards, that you may drink the ſweet fruit and wine thereof, that joy, and peace which is the fruit of believing, and of an holy life and converſation. This will be very pleaſant to us while we live, much more, when we come to die. Lord <hi>Remember</hi> (ſaith <hi>Ezekiah</hi> upon his ſick bed) <hi>how I have walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart.</hi> Conſcience checks us for nothing, but the neglect of ſome Vineyard or other, which the Lord hath intruſted us with. 2. Your <hi>glory</hi> hereafter will be the more. I know there is a queſtion in Divinity whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there ſhall be any degrees of glory? It is hard to ſhew you wherein the glory of one Saint ſhall excel another, but I think it is plain enough that there ſhall be differences of glory in Saints that ſhall be glorified, and if ſo, doubtleſs thoſe that have beſt kept their <hi>own Vineyards,</hi> ſhall have the largeſt penny. And thoſe that have beſt diſcharged their truſts to the Souls of others, ſhall have the larger ſhare in glory. <hi>He that winneth Souls is wiſe.</hi> And the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> tells us that <hi>thoſe who turn many to righteouſneſs</hi> ſhall <hi>ſhine as the Stars for ever and ever.</hi>

                  <hi>O thou whom my Soul loveth or hath loved.]</hi> The Chaldee Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſt would have us believe, that this ſeventh verſe was <hi>Moſes</hi> his Petition to God, when he was about to die, for direction from him, how the People ſhould be governed, when he ſhould be gone, and how they ſhould dwell amongſt the Heathen, whoſe laws would be more grievous to the ſincere part of them, then the <hi>Sun</hi> is to the Traveller at noon day, and asking, why ſhe ſhould live amongſt the <hi>Edomites,</hi> and <hi>Moabites,</hi> who made Idols the companions of the true God, and <hi>v.</hi> 8. the ſame <hi>Paraphraſt</hi> makes this to be the Lords anſwer, telling his <hi>Prophet Moſes,</hi> that if they would not live under the power of the Heathen, they muſt <hi>walk in his Commandments,</hi> and be obedient to the guides he had ſet over them. But doubtleſs this is a ſtrained ſenſe, proceeding from the overgreat fondneſs of that <hi>Interpreter,</hi> to apply all that is ſaid in this Song, to the <hi>Jewiſh Church.</hi> There are others who according to their different notions of theſe betwixt whom this Dialogue is inſtituted, carry theſe words in other ſenſes, you know the ſenſe which I have all along followed, is that of thoſe (and they are the moſt, and the beſt) who make it a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue betwixt the <hi>believing Soul,</hi> or the <hi>Church,</hi> and the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> It is then the believing Soul that ſpeaks in this language of a lover, O <hi>thou whom my Soul loveth.</hi> Chriſt is the primary object of the believers love, a believer loveth him, and none elſe, in a degree to be compared with him, or with a love any thing like that love, wherewith ſhe loveth him. But if ſhe loveth him, muſt ſhe tell him ſo? <hi>Modeſty</hi> maketh the Virgin ordinarily to conceal her paſſion; ſinful modeſty oft-times maketh her that is a ſpiritual Virgin to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal her love to Chriſt. She that may, while ſhe is doubting her own ſincerity, conceal her love to Chriſt, will not conceal it, when ſhe lives in any view of it, and can ſay with <hi>Peter, Lord, thou that knoweſt all things, knoweſt that I love thee.</hi> Nor when ſhe is to uſe it as an <hi>argument</hi> to obtain any favour from him. Nor when ſhe is doubting of his love to her (how unreaſonably ſoever.) Nor is the Virgin that is too modeſt to publiſh her love to the world, ſo <hi>modeſt</hi> as not to own it to him whom ſhe hath reſolved upon, and choſen for her Husband. <hi>Bernard</hi> hath, I think too critical a note upon theſe words; <hi>mark</hi> (ſaith he) ſhe doth not ſay whom <hi>I love,</hi> but <hi>whom</hi>
                  <pb n="593" facs="tcp:61084:301"/>
                  <hi>my Soul loveth; Spiritualem deſignans dilectionem,</hi> intimating a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual love. But yet it is well noted by the learned <hi>Mercer,</hi> that the phraſe ſignifieth more then if ſhe had ſaid. <hi>Omy Beloved;</hi> it is as much as if ſhe had ſaid, <hi>In quem omnes meos affectus effudi</hi> (ſaith <hi>Beza)</hi> upon whom I have beſtowed my whole heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tell me where thou feedeſt, where thou makeſt thy flocks to reſt at Noon.]</hi> Thus ſhe expreſſeth the thing that ſhe would have under a metaphorical expreſſion, the ſenſe of which we are to enquire; kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of Sheep, and Goats, was a very ancient, and in thoſe times a noble employment. <hi>Abel</hi> was the firſt <hi>Shepheard</hi> you read of, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 2. <hi>Rachel</hi> was a keeper of Sheep, <hi>Gen.</hi> 29. 6. So was <hi>Jacob,</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> (as you know) before he came to be King over <hi>Iſrael,</hi> God called him from the <hi>Sheepfold.</hi> Chriſt takes unto himſelf the notion of a <hi>Shepheard,</hi> he calleth himſelf the <hi>good Shepheard, John</hi> 10. 1, 2. &amp;c. It was prophecied of him, <hi>that he ſhould feed his flock like a Shepheard, Iſaiah</hi> 45. 11. and his death was prophecied of, under the notion of <hi>ſmiting the Shepheard, Zech.</hi> 13. 7. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 11. The Apoſtle calls him the <hi>great Shepheard,</hi> and the <hi>chief Shepheard.</hi> In this dialect here, the Spouſe ſpeaks to him. It was not unuſual for the Heathens to diſcourſe matters of carnal, and ſenſual love, as tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons between <hi>Shepheards,</hi> and ſome whom they loved. The Holy Ghoſt doth the ſame here, he by <hi>Solomon</hi> diſcourſeth this matter of Spiritual and Divine love, as a tranſaction betwixt a <hi>Shepheard,</hi> and one who dearly loved him. But what would ſhe have? ſhe would know where <hi>he fed,</hi> that is, <hi>where he fed his flocks,</hi> where he made them to reſt at <hi>noon;</hi> the <hi>noon</hi> (as you know) is the hotteſt time of the day, and ſo by the noon I find ſome underſtanding a time of <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.</hi> To this I find <hi>Mercer,</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> inclining. <hi>Beza</hi> thinketh that the Church here beggeth to know how Chriſt would have his Church governed, and ordered in the middeſt of temptations, and perſecutions, and beggeth for Chriſts fulleſt, and cleareſt manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of himſelf to her at ſuch a time (ſo ſaith <hi>Bernard,) Mercer</hi> thinks it is as much as if ſhe had ſaid. Lord I am <hi>burnt with the Sun;</hi> ſhew me that ſhadow, in, and with which thou uſeſt to refreſh thy Saints in the <hi>hour of affliction.</hi> There is a promiſe made to the Church, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 49. 10. <hi>They ſhall not hanger nor thirſt, neither ſhall the heat, or the Sun ſmite them, for he that hath mercy on them, ſhall lead them, even by the ſprings of waters ſhall he guide them.</hi> Now the Spouſe here (in the opinion of theſe Interpreters) begs to know theſe ſhadows, where the <hi>flocks</hi> reſted at <hi>noon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="594" facs="tcp:61084:302"/>
I muſt confeſs I more incline to another ſenſe. The noon was the hotteſt time of the day, and as in our Country, where the power of the Sun is nothing ſo much as in thoſe hot Countries, <hi>Cattel</hi> ſeek ſhadows, and reſting places, where they are a little free from the heat of the weather; ſo they were wont to drive their flocks of Sheep into ſuch ſhadowy places, where both the Shepheard, and the Sheep were more quiet and at reſt, which time was the moſt free time of the day for the Shepheard, when any might more freely diſcourſe him, according to that of the Poet, <hi>Fauſte precor gelidâ quando pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus omne ſub umbrâ ruminet, antiquos paulum recitemus amores.</hi> So that the Spouſe deſireth to know where he fed, where he made his flocks to reſt at noon, That is, where ſhe might have the moſt free, and uninterrupted communion with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For why ſhould I be as one that turneth aſide by the flocks of thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions.]</hi> She here implieth, that without her Lords direction, ſhe was like enough to turn aſide: She beggeth ſhe might not ſo turn aſide.

with Chriſt, is to feed its ſelf by the Tents of Chriſts Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds, and to live according to the examples and directions of his holy Servants, recorded in Holy Writ.</p>
               <p>I begin with the firſt, of which I ſhall ſpeak but briefly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop. 1.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt is he whom the Soul loveth with a ſingular love.</p>
               <p>I put in the term <hi>ſingular,</hi> becauſe (as I told you) the phraſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports it. Love is nothing elſe but the adhaeſion, or cleaving of the Soul to an object, out of a goodneſs and ſuitableneſs which it hath diſcerned in it, with a complacency which the Soul taketh in it, which is ſuch, as if the Soul wants it, it deſires it; if it enjoyeth it, it is glad, and rejoyceth in it; which being firſt conſidered, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth; that look how many objects as there are, that have in them any goodneſs, or ſuitableneſs to our ſtate, ſo many objects of our love there are in the world. And 2. That look <hi>how much goodneſs and ſuitableneſs to us we apprehend in one object more than in another, ſo much we love one thing more than another;</hi> or one perſon more than another. 2. There is alſo a love that floweth from <hi>Union</hi> and <hi>Relation,</hi> of which we are not able to give a perfect account; the <hi>Parent</hi> loves the <hi>Child,</hi> and the <hi>Husband</hi> loves the <hi>Wife,</hi> and the <hi>Wife</hi> the <hi>Husband,</hi> not alwaies out of Judgment. The Husband diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Wife a ſuitableneſs to him, is not alwaies the cauſe of love: Nor is the Child's love to the Mother or Father alwaies ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, flowing from an apprehenſion of the ſuitableneſs of the Parent to it, but rather from an <hi>impetus of nature,</hi> an unaccountable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency in thoſe whom God hath made correlates, cauſed by the God of Nature, who hath made them one fleſh; who ſo delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately conſidereth this, will eaſily underſtand a double reaſon of the Believers Love to Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt is, <hi>That Union which is betwixt the believing Soul, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> which is wrought by Faith; this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth this ſecond Union, which is that of <hi>Love.</hi> By <hi>Faith</hi> Chriſt is united to the Soul, and becometh a member of his body, and that is followed by this Union of <hi>Love:</hi> The Soul in the ſame hour wherein it is united by Faith to Chriſt, being taught of God to love the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. It's a piece of its Regeneration, which continually followeth Juſtification, and is indeed coaevous with it; ſo that as in the natural Union, the ſame day the man becomes a Father, or the Woman a Mother, there is a new Emanation of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and love; the Man or Woman that before knew nothing
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:61084:304"/>
of the heart of a Parent, now begins to feel it, and in the moral Union betwixt the Husband and Wife, the ſame day that they are married to each other, there floweth a reciprocal Affection each to other, ſo as they then begin to know the <hi>heart</hi> of an <hi>Husband</hi> and a <hi>Wife,</hi> of which they knew little or nothing before: So it is upon the Spiritual Union; as the <hi>God of Nature</hi> influenceth the Souls of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, whom he hath given one to another in natural and moral Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, ordinarily for a reciprocal uſefulneſs one to another: So the God of Grace influenceth the Soul put into a ſpiritual Relation to Chriſt: That the Believer upon his Union with Chriſt, doth find his heart cleaving to, and taking a complacency in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and begins thus to know the heart of a <hi>Believer.</hi> And look as it is in the <hi>moral Relation</hi> betwixt the Wife and the Husband, though the Man may have heard ſuch reports of the virtues and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies of the Woman before he hath married her, as hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced from him a complacency in her, yet this bears no propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to that delight and complacency he taketh in her when ſhe is once married to him. So, although a Soul upon the large diſcourſes he hath heard of Chriſt, and of his love to Mankind, and what he hath done, and is ready to do for the Souls of men, may have ſome good thoughts of him, and ſome kind of complacency in his thoughts of him, yet there is a vaſt difference betwixt this, and that complacency which the Soul taketh in Chriſt, when it is once by Faith united to him, and amongſt other habits of grace hath that of <hi>Love to God</hi> infuſed into his Soul, according to that, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 5. <hi>The Love of God is ſhed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghoſt, which is given unto us.</hi> I know there is a Diſpute raiſed by ſome, whether the natural man's love to God, differeth from the Believer's love to God <hi>ſpecifically,</hi> or only <hi>gradually.</hi> I do not think that theſe ſpiritual habits fall under thoſe <hi>logical meaſures;</hi> I am ſure it is a love flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quite from another cauſe. The natural man's love is no more than a natural Plant cultivated by reaſon; the other's is a <hi>fruit of the Spirit;</hi> ſo as they differ further than <hi>gradually;</hi> but whether we ſhould call it <hi>ſpecifically,</hi> or no, or want a <hi>Logical term</hi> to expreſs the difference, I ſhall not think it worth my time to enquire.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſecond Reaſon of the Believer's love, and ſo great and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular love to Chriſt, floweth from his <hi>Experimental diſcerning of that admirable ſuitableneſs that is in Chriſt to his Soul, and the exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing love which he hath ſhewn to him.</hi> 1. <hi>A Believer hath another kind of perſuaſion of the Love of Chriſt, and the excellency that is in</hi>
                  <pb n="600" facs="tcp:61084:305"/>
                  <hi>him, than it is poſſible another ſhould have.</hi> 1. <hi>A perſuaſion flowing from Faith;</hi> And 2. <hi>Confirmed by Experience.</hi> I ſay, firſt <hi>flowing from Faith.</hi> We know a thing by <hi>Senſe, Reaſon</hi> or <hi>Revelation;</hi> the Excellency of Chriſt falleth not under the demonſtration of Senſe. <hi>Reaſon indeed</hi> working upon Principles of Revelation, I mean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding from the Revelation of holy Writ, will ſhew even a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral man, much goodneſs, much excellency in Chriſt. But this <hi>Knowledge</hi> is very far from that <hi>certainty</hi> which <hi>Faith</hi> begetteth in the Soul, which is a <hi>certainty</hi> againſt which the Soul hath nothing to oppoſe ordinarily. <hi>Faith</hi> is an Evidence, and the ſtrongeſt Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to the Soul of what it doth not ſee by the Eye of Senſe, and ſeeth very imperfectly by the Eye of Reaſon. 2. <hi>A Believer's Knowledge is confirmed by Experience;</hi> as he hath heard from the Word of God; ſo he hath ſeen in the diſpenſations of God to his Soul. His Soul is ſprinkled with the Blood of Chriſt; it was loſt, it is now found: It lay under the guilt of ſin, and through Chriſt's ſatisfaction it is acquitted. Though every Believer hath not a full perſuaſion of this, yet he hath a good <hi>hope through grace,</hi> and this cannot but kindle in his Soul a vehement flame of love to Chriſt. <hi>Bleſs the Lord O my Soul</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. 3, 4. <hi>and all that is within me bleſs his holy Name. Who forgiveth all thine ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, who healeth all thy diſeaſes, who redeemeth thy life from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</hi> Nor hath he only ſome experience of the <hi>ſuitableneſs of Chriſt</hi> to his Soul, conſidered as a loſt undone Soul; but he hath as firm a perſuaſion of Chriſt's readineſs, as well as ability to ſupply all his wants, to hear all his prayers, to ſupply all its neceſſities, to bleſs it with all ſpiritual bleſſings; there is no Soul that lives in ſuch a view as a Believing Soul, of its daily renewing ſins, and ſo ſtanding in need of daily repeated acts of pardon, daily renewings of ſpiritual ſtrength, &amp;c. It knows it is in the power of none to help it, but Chriſt alone, he alone ſitteth at the right hand of God to make Interceſſion for the Soul; he is he alone who can be its Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate at the Throne of Grace. It is the Spirit of Chriſt through which he muſt mortifie the deeds of the body, and who muſt ſtrengthen it with might, to all the operations of the ſpiritual life. It is ſo natural to the Soul to love thoſe that love it, that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſaith, if you do it, <hi>what reward have you?</hi> The Soul thus apprehending Chriſt, its love towards him proceedeth in a natural order, and riſeth higher as it knoweth that the love which he hath ſhewed it, and doth ſhew it, is the greateſt love: For greater love
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:61084:305"/>
than this can no man ſhew, than that a man ſhould die for his friend; Chriſt hath died for it while it was an Enemy. <hi>We</hi> (ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle) <hi>being Enemies to God, were reconciled unto him through the death of his Son.</hi> The evil from which he delivered it, was the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt evil. The reaſon why the natural man loveth not Chriſt, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe though he hath indeed heard much of Chriſt, and of his love to the Sons of men, yet he believeth not, or giveth only a faint and careleſs Aſſent unto what he readeth and heareth concerning him: He hath experienced nothing concerning the evil of ſin, nor feeleth any need of pardon, and ſo cannot poſſibly diſcern or apprehend that goodneſs and excellency that is in Chriſt, nor that ſuitableneſs to a Soul's ſtate, that a Believer is apprehenſive of. And in regard the wants of the body are no way to be compared with the wants of the Soul, and the wants of the Soul cannot be ſupplied from any (except only Miniſterially) but from Chriſt alone, the Soul muſt neceſſarily love Chriſt with a ſingular love, and all other things in ſubordination unto him, ſo as they muſt ſtand in no competition for the Soul's Affection with him, much leſs can ſuch a Soul love any thing that offers it ſelf in oppoſition to him. I might inlarge fuurther, in giving you Reaſons for ſuch a Soul's ſingular love to Chriſt; but I have touched upon this Argument before, and theſe are the two main Reaſons of their ſingular love unto him. Their pourings out of their whole hearts, their intire Affections into his boſom. I ſhall only add a ſhort Application of this Diſcourſe.</p>

<pb n="602" facs="tcp:61084:306"/>
come unto him, promiſing that he will <hi>receive them,</hi> and that he will <hi>by no means caſt them away,</hi> yet he hath not there ſpoken this to any particular perſon by name, only in <hi>general,</hi> to all thoſe who are wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and heavy laden, and who come unto him, and the Soul is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten at a loſs, in determining concerning the truth of its own acts, in coming to, and receiving of Chriſt tendred in the Goſpel. On the other ſide the preſumptuous man is like the <hi>fooliſh young man</hi> in the world, that thinks that every young woman who <hi>ſmileth on him,</hi> or ſpeaketh kindly to him, will preſently take him for her Husband, and concludeth good to himſelf from every <hi>ſmile</hi> of providence, but to ſatisfy the true Chriſtian, and to convince others of their folly, let every Soul know, that there is no Soul can take any comfort of this nature, but that Soul only that can truly ſay unto Chriſt, <hi>O thou whom my Soul loveth,</hi> and certainly would men, and women be true to themſelves, they might from hence determine their Spiritual ſtate. But yet, as there is a common affection, which a woman may have for many men, none of which ſhe intendeth to make her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and ſhe may do many common acts of kindneſs for them, ſo there is a <hi>common love,</hi> which a man may have for Chriſt, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny common actions which they may do in his ſervice; the queſtion therefore is, how a man or woman may know, whether he or ſhe may with confidence look up to Heaven, and ſay, <hi>O thou whom my Soul loveth!</hi> Let me add a word or two upon this argument here, though I have before ſpoken much to it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I deſire you to obſerve in the firſt place, that the Spouſe ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth <hi>here in the ſingular number, O thou whom my Soul loveth,</hi> ſo muſt every Soul do that loveth Chriſt in truth; a divided Soul is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies <hi>faulry.</hi> That Soul which hath any thing in Heaven or Earth to be compared with Chriſt, doth not love him. It is true that love is a <hi>diffuſive affection,</hi> and may reſpect ſeveral objects, but note theſe two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Theſe objects muſt be only <hi>diverſe,</hi> not contrary. <hi>Contraries</hi> naturally expel one another, there is nothing but <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>laſt</hi> that is contrary to Chriſt; you cannot (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>love God &amp; Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> he that ſaith to any luſt, <hi>O thou whom my Soul loveth!</hi> cannot in truth ſay ſo unto Chriſt. How many in the world by their fondneſs upon their luſts, ſhew their want of love to Chriſt?</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Conjugal love</hi> admitteth neither <hi>parity,</hi> nor <hi>priority.</hi> The Wife that loveth her <hi>Husband</hi> as ſhe ought to love him, muſt nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther love any other before him, or better then other, nor yet in a
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:61084:306"/>
proportion equal with him; ſhe muſt love him before, and above all things. Our Saviour hath determined this in ſaying, <hi>He that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth Father or Mother, or Brother, or Siſter more then me, is not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of me, and he that loveth Son or Daughter more then me, is not worthy of me.</hi>

If thy Soul loveth Chriſt, <hi>thou wilt reveal all the Secrets of thy Soul to him;</hi> he ſhall know all thy griefs, all thy deſires and wants; thou wilt be much in <hi>prayer,</hi> much in <hi>ſecret prayer.

               <p>I have done with the firſt Propoſition I obſerved from theſe Words from the compellation <hi>(O thou whom my Soul loveth)</hi> viz. <hi>That Chriſt is he, and the only he whom the believing Soul loveth;</hi> there was a 2d which I alſo obſerved from that; <hi>viz. That as there is a time when ſuch a Soul will conceal its Love to Chriſt, and will not be brought to own its Love to him: So there is a time when it will own and acknowledge it.</hi> This now would lead me to a diſcourſe of thoſe times, when a believer is free to own, and acknowledge its grace, particularly, its love to Chriſt; And thoſe times when it findeth a difficulty and will not be brought to do it. But I remember, I handled that point, when I diſcourſed the forgoing words <hi>I am black but comely.</hi> I ſhall therefore here paſs it over, <hi>and</hi> come to the matter of the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition or thing wherein ſhe deſireth to be inſtructed. viz. <hi>Where he fed</hi> [his flock;] Where <hi>he made his flocks to reſt at Noon.</hi> In the explication of the terms of the Text. I conſidered the <hi>Noon</hi> time,</p>
               <p n="1">1. As the time when Shepherds having driven their flocks into ſome ſhady places to lye down, and reſt, were themſelves moſt at leiſure and one might have the moſt private, free, and full communion with them with the leaſt interruptions, At other times of the day, till night again comes, the Shepherd muſt have a conſtant Eye upon his flock. According to which ſenſe, the phraſe is expreſſive of believing Souls deſires of all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, and opportunities, when it may have the moſt pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, free, and full communion with Chriſt, with the leaſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, As the time, <hi>when</hi> the <hi>Sun ſhines out hotteſt;</hi> So it
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:61084:308"/>
may be underſtood of the <hi>Churches Noon,</hi> or the Believers <hi>Noon.</hi> When they were moſt <hi>ſcorched with Trials, and Perſecutions,</hi> So there are 3 Propoſitions which I before obſerved. The firſt of which I ſhall begin with.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> That a believing Soul is very covetous of ſuch occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and opportunities, when it may injoy the moſt private, free, and full communion with Chriſt, with the leaſt interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>Whiles the Shepherd is driving his flock to their paſtures he is in motion, one may exchange ſome few words with him, but he cannot have much ſerious diſcourſe with him, when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to his feeding place, ſtill his Eye muſt be after his flock, which in their feeding may be prone to ſtraggle, but at Noon, when his flocks are in the ſhadow, that is the faireſt oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of converſe with the Shepherd. It is true it is the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of our humane natures, that we cannot at the ſame time duly attend two different things, God is not under the Law of it, God cannot be ſo taken up with one buſineſs of providence, as to neglect another becauſe of it. But while Chriſt is ſet out to us under imperfect, and infirm compariſons, he is ſet out as one compaſſed about with our infirmities. And certain it is that our communion with him in this life, admitteth of many inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions on our part, and there are times, and places wherein a good Chriſtian may and doth injoy a more perfect, free, and full communion with his God, then he doth, or can do, at other times and places.</p>
               <p>The Spouſe here deſireth to know, the times, places, and opportunities of moſt free, full and perfect communion with God, and this I ſay is the object of every believing Souls deſire.</p>
               <p>As to <hi>times</hi> of this nature they are eaſily diſcerned, by conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering what thoſe things are which moſt interrupt and hinder our communion with God: thoſe are either, 1. <hi>Worldly cares, buſineſſes</hi> and <hi>diſtractions:</hi> or 2. <hi>Temptations, whether from the ſtirrings of luſts</hi> in our own heart (for every man ſaith <hi>James is tempted, when he is drawn away by his own luſt, and enticed.)</hi> Or from his <hi>Grand adverſary the Devil.</hi> So that times of freeſt communion with God, are times, when we are likely to be moſt free from the incumbrances of the World, or the <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>leſtations of our own luſts, or Satans Suggeſtions.</hi> As to the two latter, there are indeed no times as to which which we can promiſe
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:61084:308"/>
our ſelves an abſolute immunity. As to the former there are two times. The <hi>morning</hi> or <hi>the night ſeaſon.</hi> 2. <hi>The Sabbath day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The morning</hi> or <hi>night ſeaſon.</hi> That is a time for reſt, and when the greateſt part of the World are at their natural reſt, hence you ſhall obſerve that the Servants of God have often made choice of theſe times for their more private and free com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5. 3. <hi>My voice ſhalt thou hear in the morning, in the morning will I direct my Prayer unto thee, and will look up,</hi> Pſal. 59. 16. <hi>I will ſing aloud of thy mercy in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Pſal. 63. 1. <hi>O God thou art my God, early will I ſeek thee,</hi> v. 6. When I <hi>remember thee on my bed, and meditate on the in the night watches.</hi> Times of leaſt buſineſs, in the World and greateſt ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, from the noiſes &amp; buſineſſes of the World, are the times for freeſt communion with God, not that God is not as ready to hear our Prayers, and to communicate himſelf at other times, but becauſe the Souls of Gods People, are not ſo free in themſelves, for whereas the life of our communion with God lyeth in the <hi>attention</hi> of <hi>our thoughts,</hi> and <hi>fervency of our Spirits.</hi> And the latter of theſe hath alſo a great dependence on the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, it is impoſſible for us to keep our thoughts ſo intent upon our duty, when the noiſes, and buſineſſes of the World diſtract us, as when we have nothing of that nature from the World to diſturb or divert us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Sabbath day</hi> is likewiſe ſuch another time, and ſo are other times which we have voluntarily ſet apart for the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn ſeeking of God, but the former eſpecially. For tho the Law of the Lord for the <hi>Sanctification</hi> of <hi>the Sabbath,</hi> hath not ſuch an influence upon the World, as were highly to be deſired, yet in the places (eſpecially) where we live, it hath ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence ſo that the moſt of men and women ceaſe from all ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile labour and there is a great ſilence in the World that day in compariſon of other days: and that law taketh a great hold upon the hearts of all ſuch as truly fear God, ſo as none of them durſt ingage themſelves in wordly buſineſſes as on other dayes: and tho this be not the caſe as to ſuch ſolemn days as Chriſtians ſet apart for religious duties, yet we having laid our ſelves under a <hi>private law,</hi> tho the time at firſt was our own, and we needed not to have dedicated it to the Lord, yet hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done it, we think our ſelves juſtly to be more ingaged, and concerned to lay the World out of our ſight and thoughts, and
<pb facs="tcp:61084:309"/>
and this doubtleſs much commendeth the practice of Chriſtians in ſetting ſome times of this nature apart for the ſolemn ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God.</p>
               <p>As to <hi>places</hi> under the Goſpel we have no ſuch place as the <hi>Temple at Hieruſalem,</hi> none to which any ſuch <hi>promiſe</hi> is made, our <hi>Rule</hi> is, <hi>Every where to Worſhip the Father: Every where to liſt up pure hands.</hi> But yet though there be no particular place, concerning which we have a command, more then another, in it to make our addreſſes to God, nor any to which any promiſe is made, nor concerning which it can be ſaid God hath in it more Manifeſted himſelf to People ſeeking him, yet there are two ſort of places in which we have more advantage then in others, for a communion with God: 1. <hi>Places of Solitude,</hi> 2. <hi>Places where</hi> 2 <hi>or</hi> 3 <hi>meet together</hi> or a greater number of Gods People ſo meet to pray, or in any manner to Worſhip God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt give us advantage by freeing us from the <hi>noiſes, buſineſs</hi> and <hi>diſtractions of the World;</hi> hence you read of <hi>Jſaac</hi>'s going into the field, for meditation, and our Saviour's going ſo often up to a mountain for Prayer, <hi>Mar.</hi> 6. 46. <hi>Matth.</hi> 14. 23.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond gives us advantage, as <hi>from the promiſe of God made to the aſſemblies</hi> of his People, ſo from the <hi>influence</hi> that the <hi>Affections of pious Souls in holy duties have, one upon</hi> another, of which it is an hard thing to give an account, but it is no more then I believe any good Chriſtian will find upon his or her experience, that their hearts are otherwiſe affected, when they are in a ſociety of ſerious Chriſtians praying to God, or perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any acts of Worſhip, then when they are alone. Hence it is that you find ſerious Chriſtians, ſo covetous of opportunities to withdraw into their cloſets, or when they may join with other ſerious and conſciencious Chriſtians in more publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
               <p>If any ſhall (for the further explication of this notion) ask me, from whence a more full, free, and uninterrupted communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God is to be adjudged and determined; I anſwer ſhortly, I have before told you, That all <hi>communion</hi> ſpeaks a mutual or <hi>reciprocal communication</hi> of two or more each to other. God communicateth himſelf to the Soul in his influences of grace, the Soul communicateth it ſelf to God, in the <hi>actings</hi> and <hi>exerciſes</hi> of its gracious habits, ſo as the <hi>fulneſs, freedom</hi> and more near
<pb n="609" facs="tcp:61084:309"/>
communion with God is to be judged from ſeveral things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt <hi>from the attention of the Souls thoughts in the duty.</hi> A Soul hath more or leſs communion with God in a duty, as his thoughts more or leſs deviate and wander from the thing he is about. When there is a meer bodily ſervice performed either by the lips, or knee, or Eye, the duty is but a mere <hi>formality,</hi> the Soul hath no communion with God in it, in Praying the man doth not Pray, nor in hearing hear, nor in ſinging ſing. As to this the beſt of Gods People muſt cry, God be merciful to us ſinners, ſo that the degree of perfection attainable in this life as to this thing is but comparative, ſome may have more of this attention then others, or more at one time then at another, but none is perfect in this thing. Only the pious Soul as in other things, ſo in this thing, is ſtriving after perfection, preſſing forward towards the mark, and daily humbling himſelf for his imperfection, and flying to Chriſts interceſſion and advocation, and exerciſing faith on his more perfect righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>A ſecond thing wherein a fuller communion with God (on the Souls part) lyeth, is, <hi>fervency of Spirit,</hi> this chiefly reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the duties of <hi>Prayer,</hi> and <hi>Praiſe.</hi> The <hi>effectual Prayer</hi> muſt be <hi>ſervent,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> a Prayer which ſetteth the whole Soul on work, and while we ſing, we muſt make melody in our hearts to the Lord, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 19. <hi>Prayer</hi> is oft times in Scripture expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed under the notion of <hi>crying, wreſtling with God,</hi> pouring out of the heart before the Lord, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 142. 2. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62. 8. <hi>David</hi> calleth this a <hi>preſſing hard after God, Pſal.</hi> 63. 8. ſome think it is a metaphor from <hi>hounds</hi> purſuing their game in view.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third thing is a <hi>Freedom of Spirit.</hi> This is (as I take it) that which <hi>David</hi> calls <hi>largeneſs of heart, Pſal.</hi> 119. <hi>v,</hi> 32. <hi>I will run the way of thy commandments, when thou ſhalt enlarge my heart.</hi> There is no good man but findeth his heart more free to duty, and in duty at one time then at another; there is a <hi>ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart</hi> which at ſome times is the great grievance, and incumbrance of pious Souls, it is cauſed ſometimes from immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate ſorrow, ſometimes from <hi>fear</hi> ſometimes from one cauſe, ſometimes from another, but what ever the cauſe be, it certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abates the Souls communion with God, at leaſt its communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of it ſelf to God. And by conſequence, a freedom of Spirit, a readineſs of heart to duty, with a liberty not of tongue onely but of Spirit alſo (for without the latter, the former
<pb n="610" facs="tcp:61084:310"/>
is but hypocriſy) advantageth, and promoveth the Souls com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A fourth thing which maketh the Souls communion with God more full is, <hi>An ability more ſtrongly to exerciſe its ſaith</hi> upon God without doubting, whether it be in a ſtronger <hi>adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> or more <hi>firm perſuaſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. On Gods part the Souls communion is more full, <hi>when it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth from God more influences of grace</hi> teſtifying his acceptance of the Souls addreſſes unto him, or filling it with the ſenſible manifeſtations of his love, or inabling it more fully to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate it ſelf unto God, that it can be more attent in its thoughts, more fervent in Spirit, more free to, and in its performances, or exerciſe its faith more powerfully and ſtrongly. This I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to be enough to have ſpoken in the explication of the Propoſition, hinting you both wherein this more full, and free communion with God, is diſcernable, and alſo what thoſe times or places are where, and when it may moſt ordinarily, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be obtained, which I conceive is the thing which the Spouſe in the text expreſſeth her deſire towards, and which ſhe begs that her beloved would inſtruct her as to.</p>
               <p>That this is the deſire of every good Chriſtian, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</p>
               <p n="1">1. From <hi>its deprecation of thoſe things</hi> which <hi>would hinder it, and avoiding them ſo far as it can.</hi> Thoſe things that hinder it are, 1. <hi>Inteſtine luſts and motions to ſin,</hi> Vanity of thoughts, &amp;c. 2. <hi>Diabolical Suggeſtions.</hi> Now there are no two things which the pious Soul more deprecateth then theſe two: <hi>Worldly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions.</hi> Obſerve <hi>David</hi> how he bewailed his <hi>dwelling in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhek;</hi> And <hi>having his habitation in the tents of Kedar</hi> and how bitterly in three ſeveral <hi>Pſalms</hi> he bewails his being baniſhed from <hi>Hieruſalem, Pſalm</hi> 42. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 120. <hi>v.</hi> 5. How ſadly doth St. <hi>Paul</hi> bewail his <hi>body of death Rom.</hi> 7. 24.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Reaſon.</note> Nor indeed can it poſſibly be otherwiſe as will appear to any Soul that underſtandeth what communion with God is.

That which is the object of any rational Souls deſire, muſt come under the notion of good, and ſo appear, and the more goodneſs, or ſutableneſs to a Souls neceſſities is in any object, and appears to the Soul, the ſtronger muſt be the Souls motions to, and towards it. Now there is nothing in the World, can poſſibly appear to a pious Soul to have that degree of goodneſs in it, that an <hi>

Our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, is the great teſtimony of our union with him, and that Soul that hath no evidence of a communion with God, will find it ſelf at as great a loſs to evidence its union with him. Beſides, good is generally valued, and adjudged, either by <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit</hi> or <hi>pleaſure.</hi> The pious Soul knoweth, that the more full, or free, and leſs interrupted its communion with God is, the more <hi>ſweet,</hi> and <hi>pleaſant it is;</hi> duties are more our tasks, and burdens, then our delight and pleaſure, when the Soul hath but a broken interrupted, and diſtracted communion with him. And as to <hi>profit</hi> nothing can be more conſiderable to the Soul, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that the peace of the Soul, and the increaſe of its grace, are both much advantaged by it. <hi>David</hi> cryeth out, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. <hi>v.</hi> 25. <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon Earth that I deſire beſides thee.</hi> The deſire of God upon Earth (mentioned by the <hi>Pſalmiſt)</hi> muſt be a deſire of fellowſhip, and communion with God, which being in it ſelf deſirable, the more the Soul hath of it, the more full, and free, and leſs interrupted that communion is, the more ſtill it muſt be the object of every pious Souls deſire.</p>

Prayer, whether he finds any fervency of Spirit or any freedom of Spirit to, or in the duty, whether his Soul performeth it with any exerciſe of faith in God; theſe are things he looks not after, neither are they the objects of his deſires or indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Uſe 2.</note> Hence therefore conſcientious Chriſtians may take ſome juſt meaſures of themſelves. A Chriſtian indeed is not to be judged from his praying or hearing, but from his hungring and thirſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after a communion with God in the duties he performeth unto him and after ſuch a communion with God, as I have been deſcribing unto you; and if there be ſuch deſires in your Souls, they will be evidenced.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>By the trouble of your Souls when you find you come ſhort of it.</hi> Deſire (not obtained) as well as hope deferred, will make the heart ſick, no true Chriſtian but at ſome times, will find his <hi>thoughts</hi> more <hi>wandring,</hi> his <hi>Affections</hi> more <hi>cold,</hi> his <hi>Spirit</hi> more <hi>ſtraitned,</hi> his Faith more languid; to find this and not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for it, or troubled at it, is a very ill evidence againſt the Soul, that it hath no ſuch deſires as I have been diſcourſing of.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, Such <hi>deſires will be attended with indeavours to avoid whatſoever may hinder ſuch a communion with God.</hi> Real deſires are always attended with proportionable indeavours. He that deſires a more free, and full communion with his friend, will go out of a croud of company, where he knows he cannot injoy it. He that deſires ſuch a communion with Chriſt will find ſome time to get out of the crouds of Worldly buſineſs and company, where he knows he cannot have it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And Laſtly, The truth of ſuch deſires will be evidenced by the uſe of all probable means that may conduce to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Uſe 3.</note> He vainly pretends to deſire a thing who will uſe no means within his reach, and power to obtain it. And that brings me in the laſt place to a Word of exhortation to the uſe of ſuch means. For though it muſt be by an influence, a great influence of grace, that any Soul comes up to this, yet that is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the uſe of due means on our part.</p>
               <p>I ſhall briefly hint ſome probable means of this nature.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Make Religion as much your buſineſs as you can.</hi> I know it cannot be all our buſineſs while we are in the world. But the more it is our buſineſs the more our communion with God will
<pb n="613" facs="tcp:61084:311"/>
be. When a Boy is firſt bound Apprentice, he knoweth not how to keep his mind to his buſineſs, it is much running after his idle diverſions and recreations, but when he hath once been habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated to his work, by degrees he grows more ſerious, and fixed. So will the Soul as to its great buſineſs of communion with God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Prepare your hearts to ſeek the Lord,</hi> by prayer, by ſeque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring your ſelves ſometime from your ſecular concerns. There lyes much in this, for want of it, we are much acceſſary to our own diſtractions; and that interrupted broken communion with God, of which we complain.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe your indeavours to lift up your hearts to God in duties, and to keep off ſuch things as would hinder it.</hi> Frown upon your hinderances. If a man frowns upon one that would come to diſturb him in any ſerious diſcourſe with his friend, he muſt be very impudent that ſhould continue ſuch interruptions, or repeat them.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <hi>4. Laſtly.</hi> Beg of God to make up what thou canſt not do.</p>
               <p>Hitherto I have only diſcourſed a notion of my own as to the Senſe of my Text. I told you that the generality of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters take notice of the <hi>Noon</hi> as the hotteſt time of the day, when the Sun emits its moſt direct beams, &amp; ſo by it underſtand a time of <hi>Affliction</hi> and <hi>trial,</hi> for which interpretation, they have that of our Saviour <hi>Math.</hi> 13. 6. 21. This will afford us two no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the one more implyed, the other more plainly expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. I ſhall ſpeak ſomething onely to the firſt of them at this time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> That Chriſt hath feeding, and reſting places, and ſhades, wherewith, and wherein to refreſh his Saints in the moſt ſcorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing times of trial and affliction.</p>
               <p>I ſhall onely open the Propoſition by ſhewing you <hi>what theſe ſhades,</hi> theſe <hi>feeding &amp; reſting places are,</hi> &amp; then ſhortly apply my diſcourſe. As to the firſt I ſhall inſtance only in three particulars. <hi>David</hi> in his 23 <hi>Pſal.</hi> maketh uſe of this very <hi>Metaphor, The Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is my Shepherd, v.</hi> 2. <hi>He maketh me to lye down in green paſtures, he leadeth me beſides the ſtill Waters.</hi> It is the work of a Shepherd, to find out green paſtures for his flock in the day time and a ſecure fold for them at night, yea and a fitting ſhadow for them at noon. Chriſt doth ſo for his <hi>little flock</hi> to whom it's his his Fathers and his will to give a Kingdom. There ſhall be no
<pb n="614" facs="tcp:61084:312"/>
want of thoſe that fear him. In the day time of their lives, he feeds, and protects them by his providence, he nouriſheth them by his ordinances, and daily influences of grace. In the night of death, he folds their Bodies in the grave, their Souls in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams boſom;</hi> It is the work of a Shepherd, to provide and look out paſture for his ſheep when that ordinary paſture is burnt up like a wilderneſs; It is our great Shepherds work, to provide feeding, and reſting places, when either publick trials, afflictions, and perſecutions debar them of their ordinary ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence upon common providence, or ordinary and more pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick diſpenſations of publick ordinances, and inſtitutions, the common food of their Souls. But you will ſay to me, what are theſe <hi>ſhadows from the heat,</hi> theſe <hi>feeding,</hi> and <hi>reſting</hi> places which Chriſt hath provided, wherein to feed and reſt his flock at ſuch a Noon?</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt <hi>he feedeth them upon the promiſes, either more general, or more ſpecially ſuited to their particular trials. Jeremiah</hi> ſaith, <hi>Jer.</hi> 15. 16. <hi>I found thy words and did eat them and they were the joy and rejoicing of my heart Jeremy</hi> poſſibly there ſpeaketh of the word of <hi>Prophecy</hi> which was as welcome to him as his meat. But what was the word of Prophecy but the revelation of the will of God to him, which when it was foretelling ſome judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come upon the People is more ordinarily called, <hi>The Burden of the Lord?</hi> The Believing Soul alſo in the Noon time of his Affliction and tryal, finds the word of the Lord, this he digeſteth by faith, and they become the joy and rejoycing of his heart. <hi>By theſe things men live</hi> (ſaid <hi>Hezekiah)</hi> ſome under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand his affliction: Others the <hi>promiſes of God</hi> made to him in the day of his Affliction. The carnal heart underſtands not this food, it is to him all one with feeding upon the air. The promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are onely yea and <hi>Amen</hi> in <hi>Chriſt;</hi> they are as ſhew bread of which none but the <hi>Royal Prieſt-hood</hi> can eat, when the Child of God hath nothing elſe to eat, he will yet feed upon a promiſe. <hi>I had periſht</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) in my affliction if thy word had not been my delight, Pſal.</hi> 119. <hi>v.</hi> 92. <hi>Latimer</hi> is ſaid to have made his laſt meal upon that promiſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 13. <hi>Faithful is God, who will not ſuffer us to be tempted above what we are able.</hi> It is alſo reported of one Mr. <hi>Midgely</hi> a Miniſter in <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> that being under horrid temptations to deſtroy himſelf, and going once to the water ſide with deſign to do it, carrying in his poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
<pb n="615" facs="tcp:61084:312"/>
the <hi>New Teſtament;</hi> he pauſed a while to read a little and happily fell upon that text, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1. 28. 29. <hi>Come unto me all you that are weary, and heavy laden and I will eaſe</hi> you; upon the reading of which he ſaid to himſelf (or to God rather) <hi>ſayeſt thou ſo?</hi> I <hi>will not then drown my ſelf yet.</hi> The large field of the promiſes, is one of thoſe green paſtures; Where Chriſt at Noon feedeth his flock, and maketh them to reſt. It is a feeding place which is at all times green, the promiſes contain the <hi>Sure mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> of God. He that liveth upon meer Senſible enjoyments, feedeth but upon Graſs and Flowers. The Graſs will wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Flowers will fade. But <hi>the word of the Lord abideth for Ever,</hi> and there are ſome promiſes or others, which ſute the Soul in all its ſtates, and circumſtances of Tryal and affliction.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, Chriſt ſometimes feeds his flock at noon, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Special Providences.</hi> And theſe are alſo of ſeveral ſorts, either of <hi>Protection from the Evil,</hi> or <hi>Suſtentation in, and under trouble or deliverances out of trouble</hi> ſometimes when thouſands, and ten thouſands fall on their right, and left hand. The Plague ſhall not come nigh their dwellings, according to the promiſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91. <hi>v.</hi> 7. In a time of <hi>famine,</hi> Corn ſhall be fetched out of <hi>Egypt</hi> for <hi>Jacobs</hi> Family, the Prophet ſhall be fed by a raven, or the multiplying of the little meal in the widows barrel, and the little Oyl in the cruſe. Sometimes they ſhall by ſome miraculous, or at leaſt inexpected waies, and means be delivered out of trouble, ſo were the three Children in the <hi>fiery fornace; Daniel,</hi> in the den of Lions; of theſe there are multitudes of inſtances in Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, He ſometimes feeds his People by <hi>Special influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> either of <hi>ſtrengthening</hi> or <hi>comforting grace.</hi> In the multitude of my perplexing thoughts (ſaith <hi>David) thy comforts delight my Soul, Pſal.</hi> 34. <hi>v.</hi> 19. <hi>As the ſufferings of Chriſt abound in us,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>ſo our conſolations abound by Chriſt,</hi> 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>He will</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job) put ſtrength into me.</hi> Hence the Servants of God are inabled to rejoyce in tribulation; &amp; under ſickneſſes, have profeſſed that they were never better, and in great trials have rejoiced with a joy unſpeakable; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing in tribulation floweth not from the <hi>Tribulation.</hi> For no affliction is joyous, but grievous, but from the influences of God upon the Soul in, and under its tribulation. Some one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe waies, and means Chriſt feedeth his flock in a time of Trial, and maketh them to reſt in the Noon time of
<pb n="616" facs="tcp:61084:313" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Trials, and afflictions. I proceed to the application of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Uſe 1.</note> 
                  <hi>This</hi> in the firſt place <hi>commendeth the love of Chriſt to his lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle flock.</hi> They ſay the Devil leaves the Witch when ſhe is once in Gaol, or upon trial for her life, how true that is I cannot tell; but certain it is that his Servants have no great help from him in an hour of ſtraits, and adverſity; &amp; this indeed ſpeaks no love, which never ſo much or ſo clearly ſhineth as through a Cloud of ſad Providences. <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us that a friend is <hi>made for an hour of adverſity.</hi> But herein is the Love of Chriſt manifeſted to thoſe that have relation to him, <hi>my Soul</hi> (ſaith <hi>Mary, Luk.</hi> 1. 4647.) <hi>doth magnify the Lord, and my ſpirit hath rejoyced in God my Saviour, for he hath regarded the low eſtate of his handmaiden.</hi> Chriſt regardeth the low eſtate of his People, he leaveth them not when they are in diſtreſs, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 43. 1, 2. <hi>Fear not, for I have redeemed thee, I have called thee by thy name; when thou paſſeſt through the waters I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they ſhall not overflow thee, when thou walkeſt through the fire, thou ſhalt not be burnt neither ſhall the flame kindle upon thee: For I am the Lord thy God, the holy one of Iſrael thy Saviour.</hi> This lets us ſee the wonderful difference betwixt the ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of believers, and unbelievers. The world hath no places where to make their flocks to <hi>reſt at Noon.</hi> The Devil takes no care for his flock at ſuch a time. Other men may ſeem to do well enough ſo long as they have reſt and eaſe, and proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But what will they do in the day of their viſitation? God takes another care for his People; when <hi>David</hi> can incourage himſelf in nothing elſe, he can <hi>incourage himſelf in his God. When the Fig-tree doth not bloſſom, and there is no fruit in the vine, when the fields yield no meat, and the flock are cut off from the fold, and there is no herd in the ſtall, yet</hi> even <hi>then they can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in the Lord and be glad in the God of their Salvation,</hi> Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bak. 3. 17, 18, 19. <hi>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Uſe 2.</note> In the next place; <hi>What cauſe of rejoycing and lifting up of the head is here to the People of God, whether ſuch as lie under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi>

                  <hi>preſſures of Tryals or Afflictions, or ſuch as have theſe ſtorms in proſpect,</hi> though they be not already fallen upon them. Is the noon of Tryals and Afflictions come upon any of you? Hath the Lord taken away thoſe gourds which heretofore were a ſhade to you, your health, friends, eſtate, your outward comforts, of what kind ſoever? yet be of good cheer, God is only changing your Souls Paſtures: Hitherto you have lived more immediately upon the creature, you ſhall only now live more immediately upon God; hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto you have lived by ſight, God is now calling you to live by Faith; hitherto your great Shepherd hath fed you in the fields of ſenſible comforts and enjoyments, things that are ſeen, he is now calling you to live upon things that are inviſible, but every way as ſufficient for the ſupport and ſuſtenance of the Soul; he that hath fed thee in the morning, will not leave thee at noon time, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. <hi>v.</hi> 3. <hi>Truſt in the Lord, and do good, and ſo ſhalt thou dwell in the Land, and verily thou ſhalt be fed. David</hi> ſaith, <hi>He never ſaw the righteous forſaken.</hi> The Believer ſhall be fed, either with that bread which the world knoweth, and calleth ſo, or with that bread which the world knoweth, and calleth ſo, or with that bread which the world knoweth not of. There is a revolution of time, a viciſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Providences, but there is no change of the Word and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God. <hi>Verily they ſhall be fed.</hi> There ſhall be no want to thoſe that fear the Lord. A <hi>noon</hi> may come, but Chriſt hath a <hi>ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,</hi> a <hi>feeding,</hi> a reſting place for his <hi>flocks at noon.</hi> That God who hath kept thee in health, will alſo keep thee in ſickneſs. He that hath hitherto kept thee from the malice of a moſt malicious world, will keep thee under the preſſures of their malice: Only take care to <hi>Truſt in the Lord, and to do good.</hi> Is not this thy caſe? Haſt thou the ſtorm only in proſpect, but it is not yet fallen upon thee; and art thou only tormented with the fears of what is likely to come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee? oft-times ſlaviſh fear proves a great evil, and an evil in proſpect, is greater than when it is fallen upon a perſon. Let this incourage you to hear that Chriſt hath ſhades for his People at noon. God hath ſaid, <hi>I will never leave you nor forſake you.</hi> Let me only commend one Promiſe to you; it is made to the Church, and to every Believer as a Member of it; it is that, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 4. 5, 6. <hi>And the Lord will create upon every dwelling place of Mount</hi> Zion, <hi>and upon her Aſſemblies a cloud, and ſmoke by day, and the ſhining of a flaming fire by night, for upon all the glory ſhall be a defence, and there ſhall be a Tabernacle in the day-time from the heat, and for a place of refuge, and for a covert from Storm and from Rain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="618" facs="tcp:61084:314"/>
I will ſhut up this Diſcourſe with a word or two of Exhortation.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Uſe 3.</note> Firſt; To ſuch as are yet <hi>none of the Inhabitants of Mount</hi> Zion: None of thoſe, I mean, who are the true Members of the Church of Chriſt: Thoſe who have no title, or are able to make out no title to the dwelling-places upon Mount <hi>Zion,</hi> or any of them; what a motive ſhould this be to all ſuch to indeavour what in them lieth, to get into Chriſt's little Flock. A <hi>noon</hi> muſt come. Poſſibly it is now morning with you, and you are more careleſs; but man is born to trouble, and it is as natural to humane nature, as it is for ſparks to fly upward, as <hi>Job</hi> tells us. The Children of God in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the world's hatred, are more expoſed to others; but there is none who liveth and ſhall not ſee death; none that lives but muſt look to be in deaths often, of one nature or another. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the higheſt prudence to be prepared for all Aſſayes. Thou haſt no way for this but to get an intereſt in Chriſt. Whilſt thou art an <hi>Egyptian,</hi> thou canſt not look for the Priviledges of one that is an Inhabitant in <hi>Goſhen.</hi> Doeſt thou ask me how can this be? How ſhould I who am a Goat be transformed into a Sheep? Our Saviour anſwers thee, <hi>Except a man be born again, he cannot ſee the Kingdom of God;</hi> he can be none of that little Flock to whom it is God's will to give that Kingdom. <hi>Regeneration,</hi> a new Birth, from the holy Spirit, can only make this <hi>Spiritual Metamorphoſis.</hi> Thy work in order to it, lyeth only in ſome external actions, ſuch as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraining what thou canſt from ſin, waiting upon God in Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, calling upon God in Prayer, not reſiſting the motions of his holy Spirit.</p>
               <p>2d <hi>Branch.</hi> Secondly; This Diſcourſe ought to quicken ſuch as are of the Flock of Chriſt in all their <hi>Noons</hi> of Affliction and Trial, to betake themſelves to Chriſt's ſhades, to the places where Chriſt uſeth to feed, and to make his Flocks to reſt at Noon. What thoſe ſhades are, I have ſhewed you; our work is to betake our ſelves unto them. It is natural to us when we are purſued to look for a covert, for ſome refuge or ſhelter, where we may hide our ſelves till the ſtorm be paſſed over, and to flee to ſuch places where we think that we may be ſecure. There is no true ſhelter but in Chriſt's ſhades. Let us then inquire what is the duty of a good Chriſtian in an evil day, that he may bring his Soul to a reſt and quiet.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt and great thing is, to look out our Evidences, <hi>to make out our title to, and intereſt in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> We muſt intitle our ſelves to the great Shepherd of our Souls, as our <hi>Shepherd,</hi>
                  <pb n="619" facs="tcp:61084:314"/>
before we can expect that he ſhould in a ſcorching time make us to lie down in green Paſtures, and lead us beſides the ſtill waters, and encourage our ſelves as <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 23. 4. <hi>Though I walk through the ſhadow of death, I ſhall fear none evill, for thou art with me; thy Rod and thy Staff comfort me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That done, a Chriſtian's next work is, to <hi>look out the Promiſes which God hath made, either ſuch as are more general,</hi> and reſpect his People under any Trial, or ſuch <hi>as are more ſpecial,</hi> and relate to the People under any Trial, or ſuch <hi>as are more ſpecial,</hi> and relate to the People of God under ſuch particular preſſures of Affliction that they lie under. The Book of holy Scriptures is a great Store-houſe, there is ſcarce any condition of Chriſtians to which ſome Promiſes are not ſuited. It is of great uſe for a Chriſtian to know, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, and be acquainted with the Promiſes: They are as the Jointure to the Wife, all that ſhe hath to live upon; only with this difference, the Woman liveth not upon the Jointure which her earthly Husband hath made her, till he be dead. Chriſt died once, he dieth no more, but ever lives; but the Promiſes are what the Soul liveth upon, when God ſeems as dead, withdrawing himſelf from the ſupport and protection of his People. A good Chriſtian ought not therefore to be a ſtranger to them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is the duty of a Chriſtian to <hi>betake himſelf to theſe ſhades;</hi> to eye the Promiſes, to commit himſelf unto them, to hope in them; theſe are acts and exerciſes of Faith. <hi>Come my People</hi> (ſaith God by his Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,) Enter into the Chambers, and hide thy ſelf for a little time, till the indignation be overpaſt.</hi> Our coming is by Faith, committing our ſelves unto God, and truſting in him, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 19. <hi>Wherefore let them that ſuffer according to the will of God, commit the keeping of their Souls unto him in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator.</hi> Chriſt is the primary object of our Faith, the Promiſes are the proximate objects. In ſuch a time therefore let every good Chriſtian call the Promiſes to his mind, whet them upon his Soul, offer his Soul to them, call upon it to truſt in them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is the duty of a Chriſtian at ſuch a time to <hi>wait upon God with patience.</hi> God ought to be truſted in regard of his Truth and Faithfulneſs, his Power and Goodneſs. He ought to be <hi>waited upon</hi> in regard of his Majeſty, and Greatneſs, and Wiſdom. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are oft-times made in general, for help, deliverance, ſtrength, and the like, without ſpecifying the particular way and method which God will uſe, and without limitations of time; <hi>He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth maketh not haſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="620" facs="tcp:61084:315"/>
                  <hi>5. There muſt be a</hi> cloſe walking with God, though we be ſore broken in the place of Dragons, and covered with the ſhadow of death, yet we muſt not forget the Name of our God; our heart muſt not turn back from him; we muſt not deal falſly in our Covenant with him, nor ſuffer our ſteps to decline from his way, <hi>Pſal. 44. The Promiſe,</hi> Pſal. <hi>37. 4. that we</hi> ſhall dwell in the Land, and be certainly fed, <hi>is prefaced with a Precept,</hi> to truſt in the Lord, and to do good. <hi>And the advice of the Apoſtle</hi> Peter is to commit our Souls in well doing unto God, as to a faithful Creator.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Laſtly, <hi>Prayer</hi> muſt be added, the <hi>promiſes</hi> are Gods bonds, by which he hath made himſelf a Debtor to his Creature. Prayer is an action of ours, by which we put theſe bonds in ſuit.</p>

               <p>I Am ſtill upon the Spouſes third Petition to her Beloved. <hi>Tell me (O thou whom my Soul loveth) where thou feedeſt, where thou makeſt thy flocks to reſt at noon.</hi> Methinks I could ſay with <hi>Peter,</hi> when he was with his Maſter upon the Mount of Transfiguration. <hi>It is good for us to be here;</hi> let us build here two <hi>Tabernacles,</hi> one for the <hi>Spouſe,</hi> another for her <hi>Beloved.</hi> What ſhe would have in this Petition clouded with Metaphors, I have more fully before opened, either a more full <hi>communion with Chriſt, moſt free from interruptions: Or his more ſpecial influence upon her in her hours of affliction, and perſecution.</hi> I have ſpake ſomething already to it in both theſe ſenſes. I have but one thing to add, before I come to the words, which are the reaſon of her Petition, that is from the
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:61084:315"/>
                  <hi>form of the words,</hi> conſidered as a prayer, ſo expreſſive both of her <hi>wants,</hi> and <hi>deſires a ſupply.</hi> The Propoſition I ſhall ſhortly ſpeak to is this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> That though a Believer at all times fees a need of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and influence of the grace of Chriſt: yet more eſpecially in the time of afflictions and tryals.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Return unto me, for I am married unto you</hi> (ſaith the Lord) was Gods language of old to his ancient Spouſe, the People of the <hi>Jews.</hi> The Apoſtle largely purſueth the ſame metaphor, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 32. <hi>This is a great myſtery, I ſpeak concerning Chriſt and the Church,</hi> ſo he concludeth his diſcourſe; the Wife deſireth her Husbands preſence at all times. God hath made the Woman the weaker ſex, and the Wife ſtands in daily need of her Husband, (whom God hath made her head) to guide, and conduct her, ſhe is not only as a <hi>Vine</hi> for fruitfulneſs, but for weakneſs and dependency alſo; ſo is every be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Soul, it hath alwaies need of that promiſe, <hi>I will never leave you nor forſake you.</hi> But as the Wife hath more eſpecial need of the Influence, and aſſiſtance of her Husband, in times, and matters of difficulty and diſtreſs: ſo hath the believing Soul, ſo that he at all times prayeth with <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 27. 9. <hi>Hide not thy face from me, put not away thy Servant in anger, thou haſt been my help, leave me not, neither forſake me, O God of my Salvation.</hi> The Child of God knoweth what will follow at any time, if the Sun of Righteouſneſs doth not ſhine upon him, all his protection, ſtrength, life, healing is in the ſhadow of his Wings. But yet I ſay he or ſhe ſeeth a more eſpecial need of his preſence and influence, in the noon of ſharp Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, and Afflictions. Hence you ſhall obſerve, that though the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God have kept their daily courſes of prayer, yet at ſuch times they have uſed themſelves to more ſolemn addreſſes, and appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations to God, of which you have plentiful inſtances in Scriptures, in the <hi>ſolemn faſts,</hi> and prayers put up to God in ſuch times, and their more ſpecial Petitions, put up with reference to ſuch times, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations of Providence. Hence <hi>David</hi> cryeth out, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. 11. <hi>Be not far from me, for trouble is near, for there is none to help me,</hi> and again, <hi>v.</hi> 19. <hi>Be not thou far from me O God, make haſt to help me;</hi> ſo again, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 35. 22. It was a time of great outward ſtraights with <hi>David,</hi> as you may ſee by reading all the former part of that <hi>Pſalm, v.</hi> 22. <hi>This</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>thou haſt ſeen O God, keep not ſilence, O Lord be not thou far from me;</hi> ſo <hi>Pſal,</hi> 38. 21, 22. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 71. 12. Every Chriſtians experience is a full proof of this, ſo as the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
<pb n="622" facs="tcp:61084:316"/>
needeth no further proof, only let me ſhew you the reaſon of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Reaſon.</note> The great Reaſon is, <hi>Becauſe we are all of us more prone to live by ſight, then by faith.</hi> The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>we live by faith, not by ſight.</hi> He tells you what he himſelf, and other Chriſtians then did, and what all good Chriſtians ſhould do. The juſt (ſaith the Prophet) ſhall <hi>live by faith.</hi> But through our infirmity we do live more by ſight, then we do by <hi>faith.</hi> It is a leſſon very hard to fleſh and blood, could we live more by faith, there would be theſe two conſequents to ſuch a life.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the day of our ſenſible contentments, <hi>we ſhould live more upon the word, and promiſes of God, then upon any ſenſible comforts and enjoyments.</hi> But it is hard for us to have a ſtaff lent us, and not to lean upon it, ſo when it breaketh, we come to ſee our errors, and ſee more need of the influences of Divine Grace at ſuch, then at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>We ſhould ſee as much in God, and in Chriſt to uphold, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain our ſelves in an evil day,</hi> as at <hi>any other times,</hi> for the promiſes are the ſame, and Chriſt in whom all the promiſes are <hi>yea,</hi> and <hi>Amen,</hi> is the ſame, and Gods all-ſufficiency is the ſame, he is at all times <hi>the God that changeth not.</hi> This being premiſed as the great and original cauſe, we may conceive ſome further, and more particular reaſons.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe in this <hi>Noon, all creature comforts fail:</hi> yea, and in ſome afflictions, ſenſible ſpiritual comforts ſometimes fail alſo. In trials that are more external, ſuch as <hi>bodily afflictions,</hi> perſecutions, &amp;c. outward comforts fail; when the Sun ſhineth upon our Tabernacles, and the rod of God is not upon us, we are then ready to forget God, when <hi>Jeſhurun</hi> waxed fat, he kicked up the heel, when theſe outward conſolations are taken away, then the Soul beginneth to ſee, that it ſtands in need of ſome other ſupports. If the <hi>Affliction</hi> be ſome <hi>divine deſertion,</hi> then the ſenſible conſolations of the Holy Spirit fail alſo, what <hi>Daviá</hi> ſaid in his proſperity, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30. 6. <hi>I ſhall never be moved,</hi> we are all of us too prone to ſay in the day of our <hi>proſperity,</hi> but as it fared him with, <hi>v.</hi> 7. ſo it fareth with us, <hi>when the Lord hideth his face we are troubled.</hi> It is too natural even to the beſt of men not to know the God of our mercies, in the day of our mercies. It was <hi>Iſraels</hi> ſin, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 2. 8. <hi>For ſhe did not know that I gave her Corn, and Wine, and Oil.</hi> We do not ſo duly attend to that which we profeſs to know, that our Soul ſtrength, and Soul comforts are from the Lord, and hence it is, that in the day when they are withdrawn, we ſee a more ſpecial need of the preſence, and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:61084:316"/>
of Chriſt upon us. It is the unhappineſs, and infirmity of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, that we ſeldom either underſtand our mercies, or the Author and Fountain of them, till we come to want them, while we have health, and peace, and liberty, while we have inward ſtrength and quiet, we neither underſtand the value of theſe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, nor Eye God as we ſhould do, as the Author of them, but in the <hi>noon time</hi> of our <hi>tryals,</hi> and <hi>afflictions,</hi> whether more immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from God, in <hi>bodily afflictions,</hi> or <hi>divine deſertions,</hi> or more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from men, then we both underſtand the value of our mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and alſo what need we have of the preſence of God with us, and the influences of God upon us. At other times we live very much upon our more ſenſible enjoyments, now we have not them to live upon, and ſo ſee a more need of a God, and a Chriſt to live upon.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Ordinarily at ſuch a time. <hi>Our luſts, and corruptions move very impetuouſly.</hi> A man never ſo well knows the luſts, and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his own heart, as in an evil day. <hi>Natura vexata prodit S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam.</hi> Anger a man (we ſay) and you will ſee his temper, when God by his providence vexeth a poor creature as others will ſee ſomething, ſo he will ſee more what luſts, and corruptions are in his heart. The Devil knew this well enough, when he replyed to God commending his ſervant <hi>Job, Put forth now thine hand and touch him,</hi> and <hi>he will eurſe thee to thy face.</hi> Now as every good Soul keepeth a watch upon his heart and obſerveth the motions of ſin and luſt in his Soul, ſo he never ſeeth more of the need of the preſence and influence of God upon his Soul, then when <hi>Iniquities prevail againſt him.</hi> When <hi>Paul</hi> cries out of the <hi>body of death,</hi> he preſently cries out, <hi>O wretched man that I am who</hi> ſhall deliver me?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Laſtly, <hi>His Grand Adverſary the Devil is never more buſy then at ſuch a time.</hi> Times of afflictions are not only times of divine temptations, when God proveth, and tryeth his People whether they will adhere, and keep cloſe to him, but of <hi>Diabolical Suggeſtions</hi> and <hi>temptations alſo.</hi> When the Devil is making tryal whether he can pluck a Soul out of Chriſts hand, and out of his Fathers hand. The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> calls the Devil <hi>The fowler</hi> and he knows hard wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the beſt time for his purpoſe, he firſt gets a commiſſion againſt <hi>Job</hi> to take away all that he had, ſaving his life onely and then his Wife cometh, and perſuadeth him to <hi>curſe God</hi> and dye, and he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth him with many other Suggeſtions, and temptations. This was the reaſon of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> writing to the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> to
<pb n="624" facs="tcp:61084:317"/>
reſtore the inceſtuous Perſon who by his order was caſt out of their communion, leſt ſaith he, he ſhould be <hi>ſwallowed up of too much grief;</hi> and <hi>Satan</hi> ſhould have <hi>advantage againſt him, for we are not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of his devices.</hi> We are never ſo ſenſible what need we have of our friends, as when our enemies appear moſt buſy, moſt ſtrong, and active. Hence it is that although a believer ſeeth a need of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and influence of Chriſt at all times, yet he never ſeeth ſo great a need of him as in a time of great and ſharp trials, and afflictions, when trouble is hard at hand. I ſhall ſhut up this diſcourſe with a Word or two of exhortation ſhortly.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Uſe.</note> This ſhould ingage all of us ſo to behave our ſelves towards our Lord in the morning of our proſperity that we may not want his preſence, and influence, in the noon of our trials, afflictions, and adverſity. It is a mighty folly in any of us to live, as we had no Proſpect of the ordinary, or neceſſary contingencies of humane life. <hi>Prudence</hi> quaſi <hi>providence, Solomon</hi> ſaith, The wiſe man hath his Eyes in his head. And theſe Eyes are imployed in looking for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as well as round about him at the preſent. It is a great folly in a man to ſpend, as if it were not poſſible he ſhould ever come to want, or to live as if he ſhould never ſee death. The wiſe man lives in a conſtant view of what may be, or what is likely to be, and in ſome kind of proviſion for it. It were mighty madneſs for any in a morning (though it be never ſo cool) to conclude it would never be <hi>Noon</hi> or <hi>Night.</hi> Man is born to trouble (ſaith <hi>Job)</hi> as the ſparks flie upward. Good men ſeem to be more particularly deſigned for it, if not from the appointment of God, who hath ordered their por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in another life, yet from that hatred and enmity which the world hath to them, and to the waies wherein they walk.</p>
               <p>It is therefore an high point of wiſdom in all men to have them in proſpect, and be preparing for them; this can be done no better way than by taking heed to our converſations in times of health, peace and liberty. We muſt not think to abuſe, or to live in the neglect and contempt of a friend, in the time of our proſperity and liberty, and to have him at our beck, ready to help us in the time of our ſtraits and adverſity. God had often delievered the <hi>Jews</hi> in their diſtreſſes, when they cryed unto him, <hi>Judg.</hi> 10. 6. <hi>They did evil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

gave them, <hi>v.</hi> 11, 12. Did not I deliver you from the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and from the <hi>Amorites,</hi> from the Children of <hi>Ammon,</hi> and from the <hi>Philiſtins?</hi> The <hi>Zidonians</hi> alſo, and the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> and the <hi>Moabites did oppreſs you, and you cried to me, and I delivered you out of their hands, yet you have forſaken me, and ſerved other gods; Wherefore I will deliver you no more; Go, and cry unto the gods which you have choſen, let them deliver you in the time of your tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</hi> If as we have a need of the preſence and influence of Chriſt at all times, ſo we ſhall have a more ſpecial apprehenſion of that need in any time of affliction and diſtreſs, we ſtand highly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to take heed how we carry our ſelves to him in the time of our health, peace, liberty, proſperity. As we uſe him in the daies of our health, peace, and liberty, ſo we ſhall find him in the daies of our ſickneſs, diſtreſs, or other adverſity: So as conſidering our ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to trials and afflictions, here is a potent Argument to perſuade our keeping cloſe to the Laws of Chriſt while we are at liberty. But I ſhall add no more to my diſcourſe upon this Propoſition; and have done with the Spouſe's Petition, and come to that Argument by which ſhe preſſeth this Petition,—<hi>For why ſhould I be as one who turneth aſide by the flocks of thy Companions?</hi> When I opened the words, I noted to you, <hi>That the</hi> 70 <hi>Interpreters, Montanus,</hi> and ſome others, tranſlate the words <hi>as one that covereth her ſelf.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſo the <hi>Dutch Annotators; Junius</hi> and <hi>Tremellius,</hi> as <hi>one that ſtretcheth out a Tent,</hi> by the <hi>flocks of thy Companions.</hi> The <hi>Syriack,</hi> and the <hi>Ethiopick Verſions,</hi> and the <hi>Vulg. Lat.</hi> who is alſo followed by <hi>Pagnine,</hi> tranſlate it, <hi>as one that wandreth,</hi> or <hi>one that turneth aſide.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Radical word</hi> is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which primarily ſignifieth to cover, in a ſecondary ſenſe to <hi>wander</hi> or turn aſide. I before noted, that covering denoted three things amongſt the <hi>Eaſtern Nations.</hi> 1. <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty.</hi> Virgins therefore went vailed into the company of men eſpecially. 2. <hi>Shame.</hi> Harlots therefore covered themſelves, as you read, <hi>Gen.</hi> 38. 14. 3. <hi>Sorrow, Ezek.</hi> 24. 17. So as the ſenſe of the words ſeemeth to be this.</p>
               <p>Why ſhould I that am married to thee, be taken for one not married to thee, or for one that goeth on whoring from thee? or for one that is a mourner, through great grief and heavineſs?</p>
               <p>Or if you take it in the ſecond ſenſe, ſhe plainly hints her aptneſs to wander without the conduct and guidance of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and accordingly ſhe deprecateth it. By <hi>wandring</hi> or <hi>turning</hi>
                  <pb n="626" facs="tcp:61084:318"/>
                  <hi>aſide,</hi> muſt be underſtood a deviation from the ſtatutes and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God. By that term <hi>[the flocks</hi> of thy <hi>Companions]</hi> I told you ſome underſtanding <hi>Idolaters,</hi> ſome, <hi>Hereticks,</hi> the <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>later</hi> makes his <hi>Idol Chriſts Companion,</hi> giving it the ſame worſhip that is due to him. The heretick maketh ſome creature, his leader, Chriſts <hi>Companion,</hi> taking his <hi>Inſtruction</hi> from him. But I told you I ſhould rather underſtand it of true Chriſtians, whom the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith Chriſt is not aſhamed to call Brethren, but yet the former ſenſe being imbraced by grave, and reverend Authors, I ſhall not paſs it over without a few words relating to it. Obſerve then,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Here are two things which the Spouſe ſeemeth to fear, and ſo deprecateth, <hi>Sin,</hi> and <hi>Scandal;</hi> Sin eſpecially thoſe two great Sins of <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Hereſie. Scandal</hi> leſt ſhe ſhould be any ways a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to the Goſpel, and give occaſion to any to ſpeak evil of the waies of God, and to reproach the Goſpel.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Spouſe in this reaſon that ſhe gives for her Petition, doth ſuggeſt, that without the influence and ſupport of her Lord, ſhe ſhould never be able in an hour of great temptation, to make ſtraight ſteps to her feet, and to keep her ſelf upright, ſhe ſhould be ready to wander and turn aſide.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That which the Spouſe expreſſeth, is <hi>an earneſt deſire to be kept from ſin, and from ſcandal:</hi> She doth therefore uſe this as an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to plead with her Lord for his preſence and influence, that ſhe might not ſin againſt the Lord, nor being overcome with temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, or ſwallowed up with grief, become a ſcandal to her Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Here are two things which offer themſelves as matter for my Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>inſufficiency of a. Soul</hi> to avoid <hi>ſin and ſcandal,</hi> without the <hi>preſence and influence of Chriſt upon it.</hi> This the Spouſe owneth and acknowledgeth. It is as much as if ſhe ſhould ſay, <hi>Lord,</hi> if thou doeſt not help and aſſiſt me in the <hi>Noon</hi> of my trials and afflictions, if thou doſt not ſhew me, where at ſuch times thou feedeſt thy flocks, and makeſt them to reſt at Noon, I ſhall wander, I ſhall turn aſide by the flocks of thoſe that are ſet up for thy Companions; I ſhall go a whoring from thee, and upon that account <hi>walk</hi> as one <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered for ſhame,</hi> amongſt thoſe who are thy People. But this is a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject which I have before handled, when I diſcourſed upon thoſe words; <hi>Draw me, and we will run after thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond thing is, The two great objects of a believing <hi>Soul's fear,</hi> are <hi>ſin and ſcandal.</hi> Why ſhould I wander, or turn aſide,
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:61084:318"/>
or walk as one covered for ſhame, like an Harlot? All theſe ſenſes ſpeak her fear of ſin. Or, why ſhould I walk as a mourner, covered and dejected? or as an unbeliever, one that is not married to thee? Thoſe ſenſes of the words expreſs her fear of ſcandal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop. That</hi> ſin, <hi>and</hi> Scandal are the two great objects, of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Souls fear.</p>
               <p>What ſin is I need not ſpend many Words to tell you. The Apoſtle gives you the full notion of it when he calleth it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, A Non-conformity to the divine law, which notion comprehendeth <hi>original ſin,</hi> which lyeth in the abſence of the divine Image, and the ill complexion of the Soul reſulting from it, and actual ſin, which is well deſcribed by <hi>Auguſtine</hi> to be, <hi>every thought, Word,</hi> and <hi>deed which is contrary to the holy Law of God.</hi> Sin is often in Scripture ſet out under the notion of erring, wandring, going aſtray, and that dependeth upon another Metaphor we often meet with in Scripture, comparing a courſe of holineſs unto <hi>a way,</hi> with relation to which <hi>ſin</hi> (which is a deviation from holineſs) is expreſſed by the notions of <hi>erring,</hi> wandering, going aſtray, turning aſide, &amp;c. The Precepts of God are expreſſed alſo under the notion of a rule and a guide; hence ſin is called a crooked way. Now all ſin is the object of the believers fear but not all alike. For as there is a difference in the guilt of ſin, ſo there will be a difference in the Souls fear, it will moſt tremble at thoſe ſins which render it moſt obnoxious to the wrath of God, of which nature <hi>Idolatry is;</hi> and indeed the guilt of it much lyeth here, that in that ſin the creature is made the companion of God, and the Worſhip due unto God alone is either given unto it or ſhared betwixt God and it. The notion of Scandal is not ſo obvious, I ſhall therefore inlarge a little in my diſcourſe on that. The Words <hi>Scandal</hi> and <hi>Scandalize</hi> are hardly found in any Prophane Authors; the Scripture therefore muſt open that term to us. A Scandal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and ſtrictly, is ſomething laid in a mans way at which one is prone to ſtumble, and fall, the Word which the Septuagint tranſlate by this Word we tranſlate a ſtumbling block, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19. 14. <hi>Thou ſhalt not put a ſtumbling block before the blind.</hi> The <hi>Hebrew</hi> Word is by our tranſlators rendred <hi>offence,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. 31. This is all we can get from the <hi>Etymology</hi> of the Word, it ſignifies any thing at which another ſtumbles, and falls, thence it is <hi>applyed</hi> to ſuch things as are to others <hi>occaſions of ſin</hi> which is the ſtumbling, and falling of the Soul; ſo <hi>Aquinas</hi> I think rightly deſcribeth <hi>Scandals</hi> to be <hi>any Words, or actions of ours by which others have an occaſion of ruin;</hi>
                  <pb n="628" facs="tcp:61084:319"/>
That is ſinning which is the Spiritual ruin of a man, or woman. In this ſenſe man only can be Scandalized, he cannot be tempted to evil. But two wayes a Scandal may reflect upon God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As by our carriages his glory may be prejudiced amongſt men, his name blaſphemed, his wayes reproached, and theſe actions which produce ſuch effects we call Scandals.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>As others by our carriages may be induced to ſin againſt God.</hi> So that Scandals may be committed two wayes. When we ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have our ſelves as we cauſe the Maſter which we ſerve, the Goſpel which we profeſs, or the way wherein we walk to be evil ſpoken of; or that others by our example are inticed to ſin. Scandals are ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily divided, into ſuch as are not only taken but given alſo: and ſuch as are meerly taken but not given.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The latter is what is called <hi>Seandalum Phariſaeorum.</hi> The ſcandal of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> becauſe they were ſo offended at our Saviour. This is when men are offended at us and ſpeak evil of us or of the wayes of God for our ſake, though we do nothing but what is our duty, and we muſt not omit for the offence of any Perſons. Theſe are now only paſſive Scandals, Scandals taken, and not given, and the guilt lyeth not upon thoſe who do the actions but upon thoſe who are troubled that others are more righteous then they, and will do what they judge God requireth of them, without regard to the pleaſing or diſpleaſing of any. Theſe are not the Scandals which a good man feareth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But then there is an <hi>active Scandal</hi> or a <hi>Scandal given,</hi> and this may be two wayes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>By any open ſinful actions.</hi> Thus we call <hi>open ſinning Scandalous ſinning.</hi> Becauſe it giveth a juſt offence to all good People, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it of its own nature tendeth to cauſe the name of God to be blaſphemed, and the Goſpel, and wayes of God to be reproached, and evil ſpoken of, and is an inducement to others alſo to ſin againſt God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is alſo committed <hi>by an ill uſe of our liberty,</hi> in things where Gods Law hath left us our liberty, when we will do actions, which although we think we may do, yet others think are unlawful, and our doing of them may either cauſe them that have another opinion to reproach us and our profeſſion, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them doubting concerning the lawfulneſs of them, yet to do them becauſe they ſee us whom they look upon as ſtronger, doing of them, thus we abuſe our liberty by chuſing that action by which our Brother is offended, grieved or made weak, now theſe
<pb n="629" facs="tcp:61084:319"/>
Scandals are ſuch as next to our perſonal plain ſinnings ought to be the object of all good Chriſtians fear.</p>
               <p>I muſt confeſs as to theſe laſt mentioned Scandals, by actions, in which I judge God hath left me in his Law a full and perfect liberty, but others have not the ſame apprehenſions ſo as my taking one part may cauſe in other Chriſtians, hard thoughts or hard ſpeeches concerning me. Or if not ſo, yet my example may induce them though they doubt, yet to adventure upon the ſame actions, and ſin againſt God, (for <hi>he that doubteth</hi> is <hi>damned</hi> if he eateth, that which another who doubteth not may freely eat.) I ſay as to ſuch <hi>Scandals</hi> there is a very <hi>hard queſtion in Divinity,</hi> viz. <hi>what is a Chriſtians duty, ſuppoſe him preſſed by a Superiours command</hi> on the one ſide, if he doth not do it he diſobeyeth his Superiours in a thing which he confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth not to be forbidden by the Word God, and ſo ſeemeth to ſin againſt the Precept of obedience to them. On the other ſide he ſeeth, that if he doth the thing, he ſhall not onely grieve many good Chriſtians who think the thing lawful, but poſſibly cauſe them to intertain hard thoughts of him, or to ſpeak hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of him: or if not ſo, yet (which is worſe) to do the ſame thing though they doubt of the lawfulneſs. Nay further it may be that the command of Superiors in the caſe may be attended with penalties which may ruin a man &amp; his family. What is to be done here is an hard caſe: That it is not our duty to <hi>obey Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours</hi> in all things is out of queſtion: that we ought to obey them in things of which we are ſtrongly perſuaded that they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, whether they be ſo or no, is what no weighed Divine will ſay; whether this be not, though not Originally, yet with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to circumſtances a thing unlawful, ſo as it is not juſt matter of a Superiours Precept, that is the queſtion. On the other ſide: That St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid he would never <hi>eat fleſh while the World ſtood rather then make his brother to offend,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 13. I obſerve, St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth not ſay I will eat <hi>no meat,</hi> but no <hi>fleſh</hi> while the World ſtandeth; fleſh is but one <hi>Species</hi> of meat, he might eat other things, and ſupport his life. And <hi>as</hi> to that <hi>Species</hi> of meat, it muſt doubtleſs be reſtrained by the former diſcourſe: which is of <hi>meat</hi> that had been ſet before Idols: This he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines <hi>unlawful,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 20. doubtleſs it is unlawful for a man to <hi>ſtarve</hi> himſelf rather then offend his Brother. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of a thing if not unlawful, yet as to which he was at a full liberty;
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:61084:320"/>
he could forbear it without any remarkable prejudice to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Beſides, the <hi>Scandal</hi> in the caſe is but a contingency, he is not ſure his Brother will be made to offend by his <hi>example or action.</hi> The caſe is a very hard caſe, but I ſhall ſpend no more Words about it, that being not the <hi>Scandal</hi> which cometh with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compaſs of my text: But either ſuch Scandal as ariſeth from <hi>actions</hi> plainly ſinful, or at leaſt actions, that have no ſuch circumſtances. Whether we interpret <hi>covered,</hi> as an <hi>harlot</hi> was covered, or as a mourner was covered, both ſuch Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals are the juſt fears of all good Chriſtians.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Sin</hi> is the object of every good Chriſtians fear upon many accounts. As it <hi>defileth the Soul</hi> and taketh away its beauty, and comelineſs, <hi>as it rendereth the Soul guilty</hi> and obnoxious to the wrath of God: As it <hi>Spoileth the Souls peace,</hi> &amp; cauſeth ſour refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of conſcience. As it <hi>hazardeth the Souls Salvation.</hi> As indeed it is the cauſe of that evil, all that evil that can befall a man, eſpecially conſidering that every good Chriſtian knoweth this, and in one degree or other hath felt it ſo as it needeth no more then its own former experience to confirm it, and can have no fruit, no pleaſure, in thoſe things for which it hath formerly ſo trembled, and of which it hath been, and is ſtill aſhamed. He that loves the Lord hateth evil, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97. 10. <hi>David</hi> hated the works of them that turned aſide, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101. 3. Now whatſoever is the object of our <hi>hatred</hi> when it cometh near us, and we ſee a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of being ſurprized with it we naturally fear.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As to <hi>ſcandal:</hi> If it be given by any <hi>ſinful action of ours,</hi> it is doubtleſs ſin, and to be feared equally with any other ſin, it being but the aggravation of a ſinful act. The caſe is alſo the ſame, if it be cauſed through an <hi>ill uſe of our liberty,</hi> in a caſe where we have a <hi>perfect liberty,</hi> though the act be not in it ſelf ſinful, yet the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance makes it ſo. The reaſon is, becauſe in things of an indifferent nature we are tied up to general Rules, and are obliged to do that which ſhall be moſt, 1. <hi>For the glory of God.</hi> 2. <hi>For the good of others.</hi> 3. <hi>Which will give leaſt offence to Jew or Gentile.</hi> Thoſe golden Rules given us by the Apoſtle, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 31, 32, 33. There are three great Reaſons why every good Chriſtian will as much fear <hi>ſcandal,</hi> as any other more plain downright ſinning.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The concern of the glory of God;</hi> that is an end we muſt aim at in all our actions, whether <hi>Natural, Moral,</hi> or <hi>Religious.</hi> The glory of God is as much prejudiced by the ſin of another, as by my own
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:61084:320"/>
ſin; ſo that in all ſcandals the honour of God is wounded two waies; 1. By <hi>my own ſin,</hi> who ought not ſo to have uſed the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which his Word left me. 2. <hi>By the others ſinning occaſioned by my ſin. David</hi>'s Eyes ran down with Rivers of water, becauſe others did not keep the Law of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The concern of his Brothers Soul,</hi> which is deſtroyed by his ſin. For thy meat (ſaith the Apoſtle) deſtroy not thy Brother, for whom Chriſt died. God makes it a mark of hatred of our Brother, not to reprove him, nor to ſuffer ſin upon him; how much greater hatred muſt it ſpeak in us to give him <hi>Exemplum malae rei aedificantes in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hennam</hi> (as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſomewhere deſcribes ſcandal) to ſet him an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample contributing to his deſtruction. Love will not lay a ſtumbling block in the path of the blind. How can any man ſay, he loveth his Brother, that doth not not lay a ſtumbling block before his Brother, to make his body to ſtumble and fall, but to make his Soul to fall?</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The concern of the peace and quietneſs of his own Soul is in it too.</hi> He that is of any tenderneſs of Conſcience, will find no peace in the doing of any thing which reflecteth any diſhonour upon God, or tendeth to deſtroy his Brother for whom Chriſt died.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Uſe 1.</note> We may learn from hence, <hi>that the fear of ſin and ſcandal, are no ill ſigns in any Souls in whom they are found.</hi> It is a noble <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd Divine temper to be afraid of ſinning againſt God. The beſt of men in the Old Teſtament are ordinarily deſcribed under the notion of <hi>men fearing God.</hi> No man can fear God but the man that feareth ſin; whether he feareth the Lord, and his power, and greatneſs, with a more ſervile fear, or feareth the Lord and his goodneſs, which is a more filial and ingenuous fear, one of the firſt fruits, or prime evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of it, is a fear of ſinning againſt God; and that man who <hi>feareth not ſin,</hi> feareth not God. It is true, there may be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of this fear, through our infirmity ignorance, and miſtake; a man may have a timorated Conſcience, and be ſometimes afraid where no fear is, and this often happeneth in Perſons under the power, and prevailing of Melancholy, which darkeneth a man's reaſon. In ſuch a caſe it is rather the effect of a natural diſeaſe, than the genuine and proper motion of a reaſonable Soul. A man alſo free from that diſtemper, through ignorance and infirmity may be afraid of actions as ſinful, which indeed are not ſo; but this is an errour on the right hand. It is much better in this caſe to fear too much, than too little; to forbear many lawful actions for fear of ſinning againſt God in them, when the weak Conſcience is not fully
<pb n="632" facs="tcp:61084:321"/>
ſatisfied, then to run on adventurouſly, when the Conſcience doubteth. Let others deſpiſe and mock at Perſons, as thoſe that would be too preciſe and pure, that durſt not do ſome actions as to which others make no difficulty; nay, it may be think them their duty. My Soul ſhall, I hope, alwaies reverence thoſe in whom I diſcern an uniform fear of ſin. If men indeed ſtrain at Gnats, and ſwallow Camels; pretend a Conſcience in ſome things, but regard not the dictates of it in other things, this is Hypocriſie; this is but a pretended fear. But if you ſee Chriſtians in all their other waies ſtrict and conſcientious, taking heed to their waies, though I may think that in ſome things they fear too much, and ſcruple what I do not ſcruple, nor ſee any ſin in, yet I hope I ſhall alwaies reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence ſuch Perſons. I may be miſtaken as well as they, and who hath made me more infallible than they are? It is a noble temper to be afraid of ſinning againſt God, and ſo conſequently to be afraid of ſcandal, not only of doing acts that are openly ſinful, but of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch actions which we think we cannot do without grieving, offending, and making to ſtumble and fall thoſe for whom Chriſt died. If Chriſt had ſuch a value for Souls, as for the Redemption of them, to come down from Heaven to Earth, and to die upon the Croſs, certainly they ſhould not be ſo cheap in my ſight; as for the good of them, I will not forbear the leaſt thing which I may as well forbear as do. It is poſſible that Religious People may fear <hi>ſcandal</hi> too much: They may in ſome particulars be afraid of their <hi>duty,</hi> for fear of offending Brethren; they may lay too great a ſtreſs upon a <hi>ſcandal of grief:</hi> But theſe are very pardonable things in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of mens neither fearing God nor men, and running on in cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of actions, without regarding the offence of God or of men. Every good man will in your City be wary of leaving ladders in ſtreets, or heaps of muck, or any pits uncovered, from whence Perſons in the dark may receive any miſchief, and this is but in conformity to the antient Law of God, which commanded the Jews to lay no ſtumbling blocks in the way of the blind: Have we charity for our neighbours Bodies, and have we none for their Souls? Are we ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of making them wound, or break a bodily limb, and have we no regard to the making them wound the honour and glory of God, and the peace of their own Souls, and to hazard their own eternal Salvation? If men had any drams of true <hi>Brotherly Love,</hi> they would at leaſt forbear actions, as to which they have a perfect liberty, with which they know any number of f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ber Perſons will
<pb n="633" facs="tcp:61084:321"/>
be offended. This I ſpeak as to things in which they have a perfect liberty. For what things I apprehend that I ought to do as my duty toward God, or to forbear upon that account, I can neither do the one, nor forbear the other, to avoid <hi>offending</hi> others, the reaſon is, becauſe <hi>Charity</hi> (as we ſay) ought to begin at home; every man or woman is obliged in the firſt place to attend, and look after the Peace and eternal Salvation of his own Soul.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But you will ſay to me,</hi> What ſhall we do in caſes where we are under the command of Superiours, to do things which yet we ſee we cannot do, but we ſhall give occaſion of offence to Chriſtians not ſo well ſatisfied as we are?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> I told you before, that I apprehend this a very hard caſe. The Law of God obligeth me to <hi>obey</hi> my Superiours; it alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth me to <hi>give no offence,</hi> to lay no ſtumbling block before my Brother, and this Law concerneth <hi>Superiours</hi> as well as <hi>Inferiours.</hi> As I ought not to do any ſuch actions which probably may give occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to my Brother to ſin; ſo no Superiours ought to command me to do any ſuch things: Superiours therefore unqueſtionably ſin, in making any ſuch things the matters of their command. But admit they will not do their duty, ſtill the queſtion is, what is mine?</p>
               <p>I do not think the command of a Superior in this caſe can take hold of my conſcience, my reaſon is, becauſe his command in this caſe is contrary to the command of God who hath commanded him as well as me to give <hi>no offence,</hi> to lay no ſtumbling block in the way of his Brother. If he ſinneth in the matter of his command I cannot ſin in withholding my <hi>active obedience,</hi> that is certain. But if he will not be ſenſible of his duty, nor only command, but command under penalties that I though originally at liberty muſt do the thing, or ruin my ſelf and family, this much narroweth the caſe. Here now the queſtion lyes: Whether in a matter, as to which I have originally a perfect liberty, and ſo judge but through the iniquity of a Superiors command, muſt either do or forbear this or that action or ruin my ſelf and family: and on the other ſide, if I do do it, or do forbear it, I ſee I ſhall not only <hi>grieve my Brother,</hi> but cauſe him to <hi>ſin</hi> probably, what is my duty? Whether ought the <hi>contingency</hi> of my <hi>Brothers ſtumbling,</hi> and ſinning by my example, to rule me and cauſe me rather to chuſe the loſs of all. I muſt confeſs I do here a little heſitate. My reaſon is, becauſe my Brothers fall is not neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated by my action, he ought to live by <hi>rule</hi> not by <hi>example,</hi> to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me no further then I follow Chriſt, to allow me to live by my
<pb n="634" facs="tcp:61084:322"/>
own <hi>faith,</hi> while yet he lives and walks by his own faith. That may be lawful to me, which to him is not lawful becauſe he doubteth, and cannot ſee with my eyes. Oh! how happy would the World be, if Superiors would only preſs things which they apprehend neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary by a divine Precept (I mean in relation to the things of God, for in civil things Superiours are more abſolute Judges) and if in any thing they miſtake and apprehend things ſuch which indeed are not, they would be very tender (for that can be but in very few caſes) and if private Perſons, would learn not to judge others but in things where they ſee them act apertly, and plainly againſt the will of God, and not arrogate infallibility to themſelves, and others would learn not to be too poſitive upon their own apprehenſions, nor make others practice their rule, but to live by their own faith. But this is but a digreſſion; I ſay, It is a good thing to fear ſin, and to fear Scandal.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Uſe 2.</note> I ſhall ſhut up this diſcourſe with an <hi>Exhortation</hi> to Chriſtians, to make <hi>ſin,</hi> and <hi>Scandal</hi> the objects of their fear I ſhall not need to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large much upon the firſt, it being the confeſſed duty of every one that owneth the name of a Chriſtian, or any relation to Jeſus Chriſt. He that feareth not what is plainly ſinful feareth God in no ſenſe, he neither feareth the Lord and his greatneſs, nor yet the Lord, and his goodneſs I ſhall only tell you that he who feareth ſin, feareth the <hi>occaſions,</hi> and <hi>appearances</hi> of it. But I ſhall rather preſs the exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with reference to Scandal, calling upon you to take heed of any actions,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Which may draw out the luſts and corruptions, of other mens hearts to entertain any hard thoughts, or uſe any hard ſpeeches con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Profeſſion, and Religion.

               <p n="2">2. But 2dly good Chriſtians are not only concerned to take heed of ſuch actions, as are acts of plain <hi>impiety</hi> and <hi>unrighteouſneſs.</hi> But of ſuch behaviour, and ſuch acts, as ſhould make Religion and religious Perſons appear unlovely, to the World; let me inſtance in three or four things.</p>

1. <hi>Take heed either of an over ſad, and penſive,</hi> or of an <hi>over light, and chearful behaviour.</hi> The ſober and ſerious Chriſtian, that knoweth his times to laugh, and times to weep, and decent meaſures to be obſerved in both, is the only man that honoureth Religion. He that <hi>walks covered,</hi> by <hi>the flocks of Chriſts companions, covered</hi> as a mourner, or <hi>covered</hi> as if he were not <hi>married to Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>covered as an harlot,</hi> whoſe face is always full of ſhame and his Eyes always full of tears, doth not honour Religion; let a Chriſtian betwixt God and his Soul alone, cover himſelf with as much ſhame as he will, and let his Eyes run down with tears in his cloſet, but take heed of diſhonouring Profeſſion by a continual drooping, and ſadneſs. That Chriſtian that is over merry, and jolly offends on the other hand, and as much Scandalizeth Profeſſion. <hi>Canſt thou be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, canſt thou play fooliſh Soul who ſinnedſt to day?</hi> (ſaith our <hi>Engliſh Poet)</hi> we ſin too much to be over <hi>frolick.</hi> Both theſe extreams are to be avoided.</p>

Hence ſome things may be lawful for us in one place, and under ſome circumſtances, which are unlawful in other places, and under other circumſtances.

Where thou haſt a <hi>perfect Liberty,</hi> it is thy duty to forbear ſuch circumſtances, as, though thou thinkeſt lawful, yet thou feeſt will be grievous aad offenſive to others. 2.

               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> A friendly Compellation; O thou faireſt amongſt Women!</p>

                  <hi>3.</hi> A Direction in this caſe: Go thy way by the footſteps of the Flocks, &amp;c. <hi>Hence three Propoſitions are obvious.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop. 1.</hi> That of all Souls, the truly believing Soul is the moſt beautiful Soul in the Eyes of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Prop. 2. <hi>That the beauty of this Soul is not perfect.</hi> This Soul may be in ſome things ignorant, and at a loſs how to <hi>main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain communion with God at ſome times.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop. 3.</hi> That the ſureſt way for a gracious Soul to get a perfect Inſtruction in thoſe things which concern its ſpiritual good, and to keep and enjoy its communion with Chriſt, is to feed it ſelf by the Tents of his Shepherds, and to live according to the Precepts of his Word, and the Examples of his Church there recorded.</p>
               <p>I ſhall begin with the firſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop. 1.</hi> That of all Souls, the Believer is the moſt beautiful Soul in the Eyes of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>I will inquire a little into the Nature of the Believing Soul's Beauty: Then I ſhall give you ſome Reaſons of it; and laſtly, Make ſome Application.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It is not a corporeal viſible Beauty,</hi> but <hi>ſpiritual and inviſible.</hi> When we ſpeak of Beauty, we ordinarily underſtand a ſymmetry of bodily parts, with a due mixture of the colours of fleſh and blood
<pb n="638" facs="tcp:61084:324"/>
commending it ſelf to the carnal Eye. This is that of which <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Favour is deceitful; Beauty is vain,</hi> but none I hope will have ſo groſs a conception of the Soul's Beauty in the Eyes of Chriſt, who ſeeth not as man ſeeth, and judgeth not from any outward appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. <hi>The King's Daughter is all glorious within, Pſal.</hi> 45. 13. This Beauty lieth in the Soul's ſymmetry to, and with the Divine Law, in a due proportion of virtues and gracious habits in the Soul's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to God the pattern of Perfection. The Heathens, by the Light of Nature, could ſee that the inward Beauty was the true Beauty. It is reported of <hi>Diogenes,</hi> that meeting with a young man who was exceeding comely, but very vitious, he cried out, <hi>O quam bona domus, &amp; malus hoſpes!</hi> What a brave houſe is here, and how bad an inhabitant it hath! It is what may be ſaid of a great many comely men and women in the world: O what brave houſes hath the God of Nature made, but what ill Tenants hath the <hi>Devil</hi> thruſt into them? Within there dwells nothing but <hi>Pride, Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, Luſt Vanity,</hi> and other Inmates of corruption. Our Saviour hath fitted them with a name, they are <hi>Painted Sepulchres.</hi> The Spouſe's Beauty is ſpiritual, her <hi>Ornaments are the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh,) 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 4. And as corporeal Beauty lieth in the due proportion of the parts of the body one to another, yet this alone will not make a Beauty, without a due proportion of colours, and a good Air of the countenance: So this Spiritual Beauty lieth in the proportion of the Soul and its ſeveral powers and faculties to the Divine Rule, its <hi>Symmetry</hi> with the Divine Nature; yet this will not do without the <hi>grace of Juſtification,</hi> that grace which doth <hi>gratum facere,</hi> render the Soul acceptable in the ſight of God. Hence this Beauty is not obvious to our ſenſes. <hi>The World</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>knoweth us not.</hi> It is a Spiritual Beauty, ſo as fleſh and blood diſcerneth it not; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as we ſee things by the <hi>Eye of Senſe, Reaſon</hi> or <hi>Revelation.</hi> Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Beauty is diſcerned by a carnal Eye; the object beareth a due proportion to the <hi>Organ:</hi> Yea, there is an inward Beauty, which even the Eye of a <hi>natural man</hi> may diſcern; it lieth in the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which the mind of the man or woman beareth to the Rule of Virtue, and the Principles of Reaſon. Thus a man may ſee more Beauty and Lovelineſs in one that is Learned and knowing, than in one that is ignorant; in one that is juſt, chaſt, ſober, temperate, than in a beaſtly Drunkard, a ſottiſh unclean Adulterer, an unjuſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous man, &amp;c. But the Beauty of a Child of God lieth deeper,
<pb n="639" facs="tcp:61084:324"/>
and more remote from a carnal mans apprehenſion, in the Souls <hi>Symmetry</hi> with the <hi>pure,</hi> and <hi>holy nature of God.</hi> the proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Soul to the pattern of a diſciple of Chriſt as his linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are drawn in holy Writ. This the natural Eye ſeeth not, the Spiritual man alone diſcerneth, nor doth he at all times diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern it in ano ther, <hi>Eli</hi> could not ſee <hi>Hannahs</hi> beauty, but thought it had been only a little colour which too much wine had brought into her face. The Subject of this beauty is the heart, Chriſt ſeeth, and knoweth that hence, though a Child of God doth appear fair to his Brother, yet to Chriſt more fair, even the faireſt amongſt Women.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, It is not a <hi>Native</hi> but an <hi>adventitious beauty,</hi> you (ſaith the Apoſtle) hath he <hi>quickened</hi> who were dead in <hi>treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes and ſins.</hi> Eph. 2. 1. <hi>Children of wrath by nature even as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, v.</hi> 3. By nature <hi>there is none righteous, no not one, none that underſtandeth, nor ſeeketh after God,</hi> the Philoſopher ſpake like a Philoſopher when he determined the Soul to be naturally as <hi>white Paper</hi> or <hi>tabula raſa.</hi> The Divine muſt ſpeak otherwiſe there is in man a want <hi>juſtitiae debitae ineſſe,</hi> a want of that image of God in which lies the Souls beauty; He was created in hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, but he is become like the Beaſt that periſheth, he hath loſt the <hi>image</hi> of the <hi>heavenly, Behold</hi> (ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 51.) I was <hi>ſhapen in iniquity,</hi> and <hi>in ſin did my Mother bring me forth. What can be clean</hi> (ſaith Job) <hi>that is born of a Woman?</hi> Or how can that which is clean come forth from <hi>that which is unclean.</hi> The vitious inclinations of Children is matter of demonſtration, till they be in ſome meaſure corrected, by the precepts and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, and government of thoſe that are ſet over them, and by moral diſcipline, which yet doth not cultivate and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn them ſufficiently to render them beautiful in the Eyes of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, it is not an <hi>Artificial</hi> but <hi>created beauty.</hi> The beauty of the Civil perſon, that either from the precepts or examples of his governours or his ingenuous education, hath imbibed Principles of Moral Diſcipline is indeed no <hi>native beauty,</hi> but it is an <hi>artificial beauty,</hi> as to which God hath had no hand but that of his common Providence, but the Spouſe's beauty is a <hi>created beauty,</hi> wholly Gods work in the Soul, creating faith in it, uniting it to Chriſt, changing its heart, giving it new habits, new qualities, and inclinations. <hi>Thou were</hi>
                  <pb n="640" facs="tcp:61084:325"/>
                  <hi>comely,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 16. 14. <hi>through my comelineſs put upon thee.</hi> Corporteal beauty is the work of God in nature, and it is hardly in the power of man to contribute any thing towards that. The Painter diſſembleth a beauty but giveth no real beauty; the Taylor diſſembleth a <hi>Symmetry</hi> of parts but cannot give it. But Spiritual beauty is much more the gift of God, that is, a Gift of Special grace. Art may make a woman that is not beautiful appear ſo, but it cannot make one to be beautiful that is not ſo. Good works do little more to the Saints beauty in the Eyes of Chriſt then hanſome cloaths, or linnen doth towards the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the body. If the body be comely, and beautiful, han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome faſhioned cloaths or linnen may indeed ſet it off, but if the body hath no true ſymmetry of parts, all that good cloaths do is to hide deformity, and to make the body that is not comely yet appear ſo unto others. If the Soul of a man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man be truly beautiful through an <hi>imputed righteouſneſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent grace,</hi> good works much ſet forth this beauty to the world, and are alſo acceptable unto God. But works only <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi> good, that is, ſuch things as God hath commanded, can never make a Spiritual <hi>Ethiopian</hi> fair, nor the Soul that is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally crooked, ſtraight. The Romiſh Taylors, and Painters, labour in vain to make Souls beautiful by preſcription of good works, not flowing from a true faith in Jeſus Chriſt; indeed the truely beautiful Soul will <hi>maintain good works for neceſſary uſes,</hi> and not be ſeen in any part of the world, or in any ſtation in it, but clothed with them, the Kings Daughter though all glorious within, yet muſt have her garments alſo ſmell of <hi>Myrrh, Aloes,</hi> and <hi>Caſſia,</hi> but theſe are not her onely beauty in the Eyes of her beloved, ſhe ſtill cries out, O Lord, my righteouſneſs is all as a menſtruous cloth, as an unclean thing. I am altogether in my ſelf, as a filthy and unclean thing.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The beauty of the Child of God is not onely Adherent but alſo Inherent,</hi> Juſtification is his <hi>beauty,</hi> this I call <hi>adherent,</hi> he is in a ſtate of favour with God, &amp; hath a right to be called his Child. <hi>Regener at ion</hi> is his <hi>inherent beauty,</hi> and makes not onely a change in his ſtate, but in his nature and temper. <hi>Juſtification</hi> maketh an alteration in the Souls ſtate, and relation to God, before that it was an enemy, now a Child, it cannot be properly ſaid to be any thing inherent in us, rather adherent to us, without it the Soul cannot be comely in the Eyes of Chriſt; thoſe who in <hi>Johns</hi>
                  <pb n="641" facs="tcp:61084:325"/>
viſion were ſeen <hi>clothed in white,</hi> were ſuch as were <hi>waſhed in the blood of the lamb.</hi> Let the Vertues of mens Souls be never ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent, their actions never ſo ſplendid, yet while they are not juſtified, they cannot be fair in the Eyes of Chriſt, who judgeth not according to the outward appearance, but according to the heart. But yet this is not all the Spouſe's beauty; In the ſame moment wherein by juſtifying the ſinner, God maketh a change in his ſtate, he alſo maketh a change in his heart; this cannot be alone, neither is it cauſative of the other. Thoſe are wonderfully vain that charge us with aſſerting, that God can be pleaſed with an unholy Soul or that any ſuch Soul is fair and lovely in the Eyes of that God, who is of purer Eyes, then that he can behold any iniquity. This is what Proteſtants do affirm; That God reckoneth the righteouſneſs, or comelineſs of Chriſt unto to the Soul, and ſo makes us comely, and in the ſame moment gives his Spirit to it, to renew &amp; ſanctifie it, and dwell in it, &amp; that both theſe make up the Spiritual beauty &amp; comelineſs, but God doth not accept our Perſons upon the latter, but upon the former account; yet we ſay, This conformity of the heart to the will of God wrought by regeneration, is a great part of the Souls com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. <hi>Thou haſt</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>raviſhed my heart, my Siſter, my Spouſe, thou haſt raviſhed mine heart with one of the Chains about thy neck, Cant.</hi> 4. 9. This we alſo further ſay, That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this <hi>inherent beauty,</hi> be not that for which Chriſt accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the Perſon of a Child of God, yet God is well pleaſed with it, and it doth much increaſe Gods manifeſtative love towards a Perſon, <hi>John</hi> 14. 21.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Fifthly, The beauty of the Child of God is a <hi>deſirable beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> deſirable to God. Indeed all beauty is deſirable; this is to God <hi>deſirable.</hi> You muſt underſtand it ſafely. All deſire in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſpeaketh ſome want and indigences, in God it only ſpeaks <hi>complacence,</hi> Pſal. 45. 4. <hi>So ſhall the King deſire thy beauty,</hi> the meaning is no more then be well pleaſed with thy Beauty. God is well pleaſed with their Souls and his will moveth toward them, and the enjoyment of them, not to fill up any vacuity or emptineſs in himſelf, but to fill up their <hi>emptineſſes with the ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of himſelf who filleth all in all.</hi> Thus the Schoolmen ſay truly, That though the creature works, and moves to ſupply his own indigence, yet God never moveth nor worketh but to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate his own perfection and fulneſs.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="642" facs="tcp:61084:326"/>
6. The beauty of the Child of God is a <hi>never fading beauty.</hi> Corporeal beauty is vain, <hi>age,</hi> ſickneſs, contagious diſeaſes, many accidents, either greatly abate, or deſtroy this. This Spiritual beauty, though it may abate, yet ſhall never ſail; It is one of Gods gifts to the Soul which are without repentance, It is cauſed from the ſeed of God which abideth in the Soul. The appearance of it to the world may abate, but its beauty cannot wholly fail and periſh. It is as the air of the Soul reſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from its ſtate of Juſtification, which altereth not, and from the infuſed habits of Regeneration which cannot dye.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Laſtly, <hi>It is not aperſect beauty.</hi> The adherent beauty of Gods People is perfect, the Soul that is juſtifyed from the guilt of one ſin is juſtifyed from the guilt of all ſins. God never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gives in part (if we underſtand by forgiving, remitting the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation ſin layeth us under to Eternal death.) But the inherent beauty of the Children of God is imperfect, we know in part, and love in part; ſincerity is all we can glory in, all our perfection as to that. The habits of grace infuſed in <hi>Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> are capable of increaſe and augmentation, nor will any be perfect in them till he comes to dye: No nor then neither, for though the actings of ſome grace proportioned to our indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent mortal ſtate will then ceaſe (and ſo in that ſenſe may be ſaid to be perfected) yet <hi>Love</hi> and delight in God, habits of Grace which we ſhall carry with us into, and exerciſe in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world ſhall be made perfect there. But in the exerciſes of our habits of grace the beſt of Gods People are much more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, laying many a black parch upon a fair face, which the pure God ſeeth, and can diſtinguiſh from <hi>Beauty ſpots.</hi> Though for them he will not caſt his people off.</p>
               <p>Thus far I have ſhewed you the nature of the Spouſes beauty. I ſhall now ſhew you whence it is, that ſuch a Soul in the Eyes of Chriſt is the <hi>faireſt amongſt Women.</hi> This will appear but reaſonable if we conſider,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That their beauty is Chriſts workmanſhip.</hi> I told you before that it is not an <hi>artificial beauty,</hi> nor <hi>natural,</hi> but <hi>created</hi> and ſuperinduced upon the Soul; The holy Scripture calls man <hi>Gods Generation, Acts</hi> 17. 29. and borroweth the expreſſion from an Heathen Poet, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> they ſaw that by the light of Nature. The Apoſtle tells us, Eph. 2. 10. <hi>That we are Gods workmanſhip created to good works, which God had before or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained,</hi>
                  <pb n="643" facs="tcp:61084:326"/>
                  <hi>that we ſhould walk in them,</hi> God, had ordained it Chriſt wrought it. Whatſoever of good a Child of God hath in him it is all from God, he is <hi>begotten of God, John</hi> 1. 13. We are <hi>created</hi> by him to good works, and he worketh in us to will and do. Are we <hi>juſtified,</hi> and is that any part of our beauty? We are <hi>juſtifyed by his grace, waſhed in his blood. Except I waſh you</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>you have no part in me.</hi> It is natural to us all to account any thing beſt, and faireſt, to which our ſelves have contributed any thing as a cauſe. The Father and Mother value their own Child above any others: The man of art takes moſt delight in his own <hi>workmanſhip.</hi> God can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but what is truly, and highly good, and he cannot but be moſt pleaſed in his own work.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, <hi>The beauty of the Child of God is Chriſts beauty,</hi> and <hi>lyeth in the Souls aſſimilation, or being made like</hi> unto Chriſt. Is he juſtifyed? It is by the <hi>imputation of his righteouſneſs.</hi> Is he <hi>regenerated?</hi> It is through his <hi>Spirit</hi> and by his regeneration, the <hi>image of God,</hi> and Chriſt is renewed in him in <hi>Knowledge, righteouſneſs and holineſs,</hi> the like mind is in him that was in Chriſt. Likeneſs is the Mother of Love, and all Love floweth from ſome likeneſs or conceived likeneſs in the object beloved. Chriſt cannot but love that Soul that is made partaker of the Divine nature, &amp; renewed according to his image, &amp; made like unto himſelf. The believer was predeſtinated to be conform to the Image of the Son, &amp; by Faith &amp; <hi>Regeneration</hi> he is made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, renewed according <hi>to the image of God,</hi> (according to the Apoſtles phraſe.) If <hi>Jacob</hi> knew his ſons coat again, and the ſight of it was enough to ſet the Fathers bowels on yerning, Chriſt will doubtleſs know his own robes, and cannot but account that Soul moſt beautiful, that is adorned with &amp; dreſſed in them.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Uſe 1.</note> This in the firſt place may ſerve to convince us of the truth of what <hi>John</hi> tells us, 1. <hi>John</hi> 5. 19. <hi>That the whole world lyeth in wickedneſs.</hi> For theſe Souls whom Chriſt judgeth and calleth the <hi>faireſt amongſt Women:</hi> The moſt lovely and beautiful Souls, are thoſe who in the Eyes of the generality in the world are counted the moſt unlovely, deſpicable, and contemptible Perſons in nature in ſo much that Godly men and women may take up the words of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 9. concerning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and thoſe of his own order, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 9. <hi>We think, that God hath ſet as forth</hi> as it <hi>were appointed unto death, for we are made</hi>
                  <pb n="644" facs="tcp:61084:327"/>
                  <hi>a ſpectacle to the world, to angels and to men.</hi> We are <hi>fools</hi> for Chriſts ſake, profane, leud men they are wiſe, <hi>we are weak,</hi> they are ſtrong, they are honourable, we are deſpiſed; the People of God, in the preſent age, in all former ages are they who hunger, and thirſt, who are naked and buffeted, and have no certain dwelling place, yet they labour, working with their hands, being reviled they bleſs, being perſecuted they ſuffer it, being defamed they intreat, yet are they made as the filth of the world, as the off-ſcouring of all Nations even to this day. Thus it was under the Old Teſtament, the prophet complained in his time, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59. 15. <hi>That truth failed, and he who departed from evil made himſelf a prey,</hi> but he addeth, and <hi>the Lord ſaw it, and it diſpleaſed him that there was no judgment.</hi> It was ſo under the New Teſtament; who was more deſpiſed, and reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of men then Chriſt? Who was more reviled, contemned, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed both in words and deeds then <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> Chriſt, and his bleſſed Apoſtles, and all the Primitive Chriſtians? Chriſt foretold his diſciples, that the world ſhould hate them, that they ſhould ſpeak of them all manner of Evil, perſecute them, turn them out of their <hi>Synagogues,</hi> &amp;c. It is ſo in our times, if there be in any places Perſons fearing God, and working righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, Perſons that make a conſcience of their waies, that fear an Oath, that durſt not drink, and ſwear, and curſe, and blaſpheme the living God, as others do, that make conſcience of their worſhipping God, and are a little more ſtrict and frequent in it then others are. Theſe are the Perſons againſt whom the world ſpits all their venom, againſt whom their hands are lifted up, men may meet together to drink, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, to hear leud and profane Songs, and Plays, but not to <hi>pray,</hi> not to conſider and exhort one another to love, and to good works; what is this an Evidence of but that the <hi>world lyeth in wickedneſs?</hi> Chriſt judgeth pious Souls, the faireſt Souls, theſe are they ſor whom he died. Whom he calls his Siſter, his Spouſe, the faireſt Souls in the creation; theſe are thoſe Souls, whom the World ſets up as marks to ſhoot all their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venomed arrows, bitter words againſt, to offer all affronts, and indignities unto. Shall not the Lord viſit for theſe things? Shall he not be avenged on ſuch a generation? Shall a gallant in the World, draw his Sword upon the man that affronts his Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, or Miſtreſs, a wanton Woman that he hath eſpouſed, or
<pb n="645" facs="tcp:61084:327"/>
to whom his heart cleaveth, and ſhall the Lord bear theſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts, theſe injuries offered to Souls that are more precious in the Eyes of their Lord then all the world is beſide? Hear what the Lord ſaid by his prophet as to that antient People of his, Iſa. 43. 2, 3. <hi>I am the Lord thy God, the holy one of Iſrael, thy Saviour, I gave</hi> Egypt <hi>for thy ranſom:</hi> Ethiopia <hi>and</hi> Seba <hi>for thee. Since thou wert pretious in my ſight thou haſt been honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and I have loved thee, therefore will I give men for thee, and People for thy life.</hi> Was this ſpoken for the Jews only think we, or did this concern the profane part of the Jews, or thoſe only that feared the Lord, walked in his commandments, and worſhiped him in Spirit and in truth? That it was not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood with reference to or upon the account of the leud, and profane part of the Jewiſh Nation is evident, by Gods declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed deteſtation of them by the ſame prophet, and by others of his Prophets. If it were ſpoken with reference to ſuch as fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God, and walked in his commandments, and kept cloſe to the rule of Worſhip which he had given them, it holds good ſtill to all Souls that fall under that Character. They are preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in Gods fight, honourable, he hath loved them, the holy one of <hi>Iſrael</hi> is their Saviour, and the worlds hatred of them, profane mens reviling, contemning, abuſing them, is but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Evidence, <hi>that the world knoweth them not,</hi> and ſpeaketh evil of, and doth evil to things and Perſons they know not: Or that it lieth in wickedneſs, in a vile and wicked Error of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, judging thoſe vile, and baſe, whom God judgeth precious and honourable, and thoſe worthy of hatred, whom he loveth, &amp; though the Lord may for a time ſuffer his good &amp; righteous Servants to be thus reviled, thus treated, thus abuſed, by leud and ungodly men, for the trial of their faith, and for the exerciſe of their patience, and that ſome of the blood of his Saints may be poured into the cup of wicked mens ſins, that the cup of their iniquities may be full, and they may fill up their meaſures of ſinning, That upon them may come all the righteous blood of his People, which hath been ſhed, yet be aſſured, the Lord will not ſuffer it alwaies, but awake as one out of ſleep, &amp; plead the cauſe of his People, and give <hi>Egypt</hi> for their ranſom and <hi>Ethiopia</hi> and <hi>Seba,</hi> and they will find at laſt, that God will give men for them, and People for their lives. Poſſibly ſome will ſay to us, but how ſhall we know theſe whom Chriſt calls
<pb n="646" facs="tcp:61084:328"/>

were in the quarry as unlovely rude ſtones as any others; it is the Lord that hath hewed them out, that hath poliſhed them and of grace hath ſuperinduced that beauty upon them wherein they glory, and if they have received their beauty they have no reaſon to glory as if they had not received it. I ſay he that conſidereth this, and that now at the beſt he is not without ſpots, his beauty is not perfect, at leaſt that part of his beauty which is inherent in him is not perfect, this will ſhew a thinking. Chriſtian eternal cauſe to walk ſoftly towards men, and humbly as well as thankfully toward God. Grace leaves no room for, giveth no advantage unto pride; hence though a believer moſt excelleth all other Souls, yet he ordinarily leaſt excelleth them in his own apprehenſions.</p>

If Chriſt can ſee ſo much beauty in us who are poor creatures, poor worms of the Earth, who have no beauty but what he hath put upon us, and into us, certainly we muſt be very blind if we can ſee no beauty, no lovelineſs, nothing to be deſired in him, who is the bright Image of his Fathers <hi>glory,</hi> and the expreſs Image of his Perſon, whom all the <hi>Angels,</hi> adore, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, and in whom the Soul of the everlaſting Father reſteth, and is well pleaſed, and who is his great delight.</p>

The Spouſes requeſt was, to be inſtructed how ſhe might enjoy, a full and free communion with her Lord eſpecially in a time of trial and diſtreſs with reference to this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition; her Lord anſwereth her, <hi>If thou knoweſt not;</hi> Suppoſing ſhe might as to this at ſome times be ignorant, and at a loſs; The Propoſition is plain:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> That even the beſt of Gods People (the faireſt amongſt Women) may ſometimes be at a great loſs where, and how to maintain their deſired communion with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>I ſhall open the Propoſition in three concluſions. Then confirm and apply it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Souls communion with Chriſt lyes in their reciprocal communications of themſelves each to other.</hi> All communion is made up of a mutual communication of two or more Perſons. I have diſcourſed the nature of communion largely in ſome of my former diſcourſes and therefore ſhall ſay little of it now. Onely I ſay all communion lyes in a mutual and reciprocal communication. Thus two friends have communion each
<pb n="655" facs="tcp:61084:332"/>
with other by frequent meetings together, mutual diſcourſes, and communications of the Secrets of each others hearts, one to another. The Subjects in this communion are Souls clothed with bodies, and their communion is bodily. But now the Soul con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered with Chriſt, as its correlate in this communion, are <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi> and their communion is more Spiritual. The Soul perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth its part in it by the ſecret exerciſe of the powers God hath given it upon Chriſt as the object. By Spiritual Meditations, the exerciſe of <hi>faith,</hi> love, hope, deſire, joy and delight, &amp;c. By giving up its will to his will, aſſenting to what he dictateth in his word, conſenting to what he there commandeth, &amp;c. Chriſt communicates himſelf to the Soul by the ſecret influences of his Spirit, opening and inlightening the underſtanding, bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and inclining the will, influencing the affections, convincing, ſtrengthening, quickening, comforting the Soul. Indeed there is a more external communion with God, but ſeparated from this it ſignifieth nothing to the Souls advantage; ſo we are ſaid to have communion with God, in reading, and hearing his word, praying, receiving the Sacraments, the Soul hath in theſe no further fellowſhip &amp; communion with God, then it in them exerciſeth theſe more inward powers in more external acts by the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the bodily members; ſo far as it poureth out itſelf to God, in prayer by the words of the lips, or opens its heart to God in hearing the word, receiveth it with <hi>faith</hi> and love, and meekneſs, &amp;c. So far and no further, hath the Soul in theſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties any communion with God. Nor doth God communicate himſelf to the Soul that is not made to believe and obey what it heareth further then to let it know his will with the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of ſuch arguments as his Miniſters are inabled to uſe by vertue of thoſe gifts which he hath given them to fit them for their miniſtration.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>There can be no union between Chriſt, and that Soul, with whom Chriſt hath not a conſtant communion,</hi> communion is the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of union, according to the nature of the union. Wherever <hi>communion</hi> wholly ceaſeth, the union is diſſolved. Indeed where the <hi>communion is voluntary</hi> (not from a natural cauſe) there may be great differences in the degrees of it, but wholly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted it cannot be; hence God and Chriſt have a conſtant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the believing Soul, this is by the Spirit of God given to them, and dwelling, and working in them, and the
<pb n="656" facs="tcp:61084:333"/>
                  <hi>ſeed of God</hi> abiding in them. Our union with Chriſt is preſerved by the ſame means by which it was at firſt made, which was by Gods firſt communication of his power and goodneſs to the Soul, and the Souls communication of itſelf by faith to him. Thus the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> was firſt made between God, and the Soul, thus it is, and muſt be maintained, and upheld. The reaſon why we ſay the Soul once in a ſtate of grace cannot fall from it, either <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,</hi> or <hi>totally,</hi> is not from the <hi>ability, and certainty of their own wills,</hi> however renewed, and ſanctified, but from the more conſtant, and certain influences of the Spirit of Grace, which is given to the Soul, dwelleth in it, and worketh in it; Chriſt hath not only promiſed to come to them that love him, and keep his Commandments, but to make his abode with him, hence the union between Chriſt, &amp; the Soul, is not only compared to the <hi>moral union</hi> between the <hi>Husband and Wife, Eph.</hi> 5. 30. but to the <hi>natural union</hi> between the <hi>Vine</hi> and the <hi>Branches, John</hi> 15. 1. betwixt which (while they remain united) there is a conſtant communication, and in very deed did not the Soul of a believer daily receive divine influences and communications, it muſt <hi>wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and <hi>die</hi> as naturally, as the Branch doth, when the union is broken betwixt it and the Vine, and this our Saviour teacheth us, <hi>John</hi> 15. 4. <hi>As the Branch cannot bring forth fruit, unleſs it abideth in the Vine, ſo no more can you, except you abide in me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3.</hi> Although the Souls communion with Chriſt can never be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly interrupted, and broken, yet it may be more of leſs, and ſometimes indiſcerned by the Soul. <hi>I ſay it may be</hi> more <hi>or</hi> leſs. <hi>God may more, or leſs communicate himſelf to the Soul, as to his influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of</hi> ſtrengthening, quickning, comforting grace, <hi>and the Soul that moveth from theſe principles, may be able, more or leſs to</hi> communicate itſelf to God <hi>in the exerciſes of</hi> meditation, <hi>faith, joy, and delight in God. Nay, ſometimes Gods influences may be ſo ſecret, and indiſcernable, that the Soul may cry out as one forſaken of God, and a ſtranger to him. This hath ſo plentiful an evidence in Holy Writ, as the truth of it cannot be diſputed. We find</hi> David, Pſal. <hi>22. 1. crying out,</hi> My God! my God, why haſt thou forſaken me? Why art thou ſo far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring, <hi>and the Pſalmiſt,</hi> Pſal. <hi>77 3.</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred God, and was troubled. <hi>v. 4.</hi>—I am ſo troubled, that I cannot ſpeak. <hi>v. 7.</hi> Will the Lord caſt off for ever? And will he be favourable no more? Is his mercy clean gone for ever? Doth his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe fail for evermore? Hath God forgotten to be gracious? Hath
<pb n="657" facs="tcp:61084:333"/>
he in anger ſhut up his tender mercies? <hi>There are many inſtances of this nature in the</hi> Pſalms, <hi>we have an inſtance in this Song,</hi> Cant. <hi>5. 1, 2.</hi> By night upon my Bed, I ſought him whom my Soul loveth, I ſought him, but I found him not. <hi>v. 2.</hi> I will riſe now, and go about the City, in the ſtreets, and in the broad places, I will ſeek him whom my Soul loveth, I ſought him, but I found him not. <hi>v. 3.</hi> The Watchmen that go about the City, found me, to whom I ſaid, ſaw ye him whom my Soul loveth. <hi>So Cant. 5. 5.</hi> I roſe up to open to my Beloved, and my Hands dropped with Myrrh, and my Fingers with ſweet ſmelling Myrrh upon the Handles of the lock, I opened to my Beloved, but he had withdrawn himſelf, and was gone, my Soul failed when he ſpake, I ſought him, but I could not find him, I called him, but he gave me no anſwer. <hi>What do all theſe meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorical expreſſions purport? but this, that there are times when the Soul finds a difficulty to maintain, or diſcern its communion with God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sometimes God doth not as at other times breath upon, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate himſelf to the Souls, even of the beſt of his people, the faileur ſeemeth to be on Gods part, for ſome juſt cauſe, the Soul findeth ſome freedom to impart, and communicate its ſelf to God, but findeth not Gods aſſiſtances, influences, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications of himſelf to it, as it deſireth, and as it hath expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced from God at other times; this looks like the caſe of the Spouſe in thoſe two places of this Song before mentioned.</p>
               <p>Sometimes again the Soul eaſily diſcerneth the faileur in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, it cannot <hi>meditate</hi> upon God. It remembreth God, and is troubled, it cannot pray with any fervour, nor exerciſe faith with any boldneſs; this ſeems to be the caſe of the <hi>Pſalmiſt, Pſal.</hi> 77. That the thing is ſo evident, let me therefore rather ſpend time to ſearch out the reaſons of ſuch a diſpenſation on Gods part, and affliction on ours.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Oh Gods part</hi> we uſually call ſuch a <hi>diſpenſation a deſertion,</hi> ſo as the cauſe of it is the withdrawing of ſome divine influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from the Soul. It was truly ſaid of <hi>Auguſtine, Deus non de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerit etiamſi deſerere videatur.</hi> Though God ſeemeth to forſake, yet he never wholly forſaketh any Soul to whom he is united, it is the withdrawing only of ſome ſenſible manifeſtations of his love. All divine deſertions are either founded in Divine Juſtice, or in the <hi>Divine Wiſdom,</hi> ſo as the account which can be given of any ſuch <hi>diſpenſation</hi> on Gods part, muſt fall under one of thoſe two heads.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="658" facs="tcp:61084:334"/>
1. When it is founded in <hi>Juſtice,</hi> it alwaies is for the <hi>puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſin.</hi> For though God upon the Covenant of Grace hath reſerved no liberty to himſelf eternally to forſake his people, no nor yet <hi>totally,</hi> yet he hath reſerved to himſelf a liberty for temporary afflictions of them; you have (as to this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar) a fair copy of the Covenant of grace, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 26. 27, &amp;c. The Covenant of Grace was made with Chriſt from Eternity, the tenour of it was revealed variouſly, to <hi>Adam</hi> upon the Fall, to <hi>Noah,</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to <hi>David;</hi> in that Pſalm you have the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of it to <hi>David,</hi> v. 20. 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26. <hi>He ſhall cry unto me; thou art my Father, my God, and the rock of my Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Alſo I will make him my firſt born, higher then the Kings of the Earth.</hi> v. 28. <hi>My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my Covenant ſhall ſtand faſt with him. His Seed alſo will I make to endure for ever, and his Throne as the days of Heaven.</hi> As this Covenant was made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed, <hi>I am thy God, and the God of thy Seed, Gen.</hi> 17. So in the further revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it to <hi>David,</hi> it is declared to relate to <hi>him and his Seed.</hi> Now followeth <hi>v.</hi> 30. <hi>If his Children forſake my Law, and walk not in my Judgments, if they break my Statutes, and keep not my Commandments:</hi> That is, if they ſin againſt me, (for all thoſe phraſes do but expreſs ſin) then <hi>v.</hi> 32. <hi>Will I viſit their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion with the rod, and their iniquity with ſtripes. Nevertheleſs my loving kindneſs will I not utterly take from him, nor ſuffer my faithfulneſs to fail. My Covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.</hi> God you ſee hath reſerved to himſelf upon his Covenant of Grace with his People, a liberty to viſit <hi>their tranſgreſſion with the Rod; and their iniquity with ſtripes,</hi> but no liberty <hi>utterlyto take away his loving kindneſs</hi> from them: Afflictions (which are there call'd a <hi>viſitation with rods and ſtripes)</hi> either reſpect the outward, or the inward man: Thoſe which relate to the outward man, are diſeaſes, pains, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions, &amp;c. Thoſe which relate to the inward man, are <hi>deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> and <hi>temptations,</hi> which God permitteth, though himſelf moveth none to Evil. <hi>Deſertions</hi> are either <hi>total,</hi> or <hi>partial;</hi> as to the former God hath forecloſed himſelf by the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> in which he hath ſaid, <hi>He will never leave his People, nor forſake them. His loving kindneſs he will not utterly take from them, nor ſuffer his faithfulneſs to ſail,</hi> Pſal. 89. 33. <hi>Partial deſertions</hi> therefore are the only <hi>rod,</hi> the only <hi>ſtripes</hi> which God
<pb n="659" facs="tcp:61084:334"/>
hath reſerved to puniſh his people with (as to their inward man) <hi>who break his Statutes, and keep not his Commandments,</hi> theſe muſt be the withdrawings of ſome <hi>manifeſtations of his love,</hi> which are promiſed to thoſe <hi>who love him, and keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.</hi> Hence it is, that as <hi>Sampſon</hi> found the continuing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of God upon him (as to his bodily ſtrength) while he kept his <hi>vow</hi> and <hi>covenant</hi> with God as a <hi>Nazarite,</hi> yet when he had betrayed himſelf to <hi>Dalilah,</hi> and ſhe had ſhaved off his locks, he diſcerned that <hi>God was departed from him,</hi> and he had not ſtrength to do, as at other times, whatever he reſolved: ſo when the Soul that found in itſelf a ſtrength before ſufficient to grapple with its temptations, and to perform the ſeveral duties and operations of a Spiritual life, hath ſuffered itſelf to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with motions; and temptations to ſin, it finds itſelf weak, falls before a temptation, fails in its Spiritual duties, it cannot believe, hope, meditate, rejoice, and delight in God, &amp;c. Thus it was with <hi>Peter,</hi> that had <hi>faith</hi> enough to walk upon the Sea at Chriſts command, when he had ſinned by too much confidence in himſelf, he falls by the hand of a ſilly Damſel in the High Prieſts Hall, hence it is oft-times, that the livelineſs, and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of the Soul in its converſation alſo fails, and it is at a loſs where to find its beloved, and how to enjoy its deſired com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Sometimes theſe diſpenſations are not ſo much founded in the Divine Juſtice, and intended as the puniſhment of guilt in the Soul, as in the <hi>Divine Wiſdom</hi> deſigning to <hi>prove,</hi> and <hi>to try his People, and to make them to ſeek more after him. Job</hi> was thus tried. Though <hi>Job</hi> doubtleſs had guilt enough of ſin to have juſtified God in ſuch providences, yet God himſelf ſaith of him, <hi>Job</hi> 2. 3. <hi>That there was none like him in the Earth; that he was a perfect, and an upright man, one that feared God, and eſchewed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi> yet had he not been under ſome <hi>divine deſertion, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawings of grace,</hi> as well as more external Trials, he had never fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into thoſe extravagant paſſions in which you find him, <hi>ch.</hi> 3, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>On our part this loſs and ignorance</hi> happeneth divers ways. I ſhall inſtance in ſome more principal cauſes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The prevailing of ſin and corruption in the Soul.</hi> The guile of ſin alwaies cauſeth <hi>weakneſs</hi> and <hi>blindneſs. How weak is thine heart, ſaith the Lord, ſeeing thou doſt all theſe things,</hi> Zech. 16 30. <hi>Weakneſs is the cauſe of ſin,</hi> and it is the <hi>effe ct</hi> of ſin, it argueth
<pb n="660" facs="tcp:61084:335"/>
weakneſs in a Soul to do thoſe things which God hath forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and which will certainly end in the harm of the Soul. It is a weak thing wilfully to ſin againſt God, and <hi>weakneſs</hi> is alſo the <hi>effect of ſin,</hi> this is cauſed from the ſour reflections, and reverbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of conſcience, when a man would medirate on God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and hope, joy, rejoice, and delight in God, conſcience throws his ſin in his face, and bringeth his iniquity to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, he remembreth God, and is troubled, he cannot tell how to believe, how to hope, how to joy, and rejoice in God, whom he now looketh upon as angry with him; for the proof of this (though I might fetch enough from <hi>Davids</hi> Poenitenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al <hi>Pſalms)</hi> yet I need no more then the experience of every good Chriſtian, who keepeth any watch upon his own heart and ways. I appeal to any of your Souls, when you are conſcious of any wilful ſlips, and failings in your life, can you remember, and think of God as at other times? Can you believe, and hope in his mercy; Can you pray with that boldneſs, and courage, and confidence, doth not ſhame cover your faces, ſo as you know not how to look upward?</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Diabolical ſuggeſtions</hi> are another cauſe; what ſtrange and horrid impreſſions do the beſt of Gods people find? ſome indeed of more ſtrength, and longer continuance then others, but there is ſcarce any who doth not find them at ſome times, and in ſome degree, or other, and although if they be mere impreſſions, not conſented to by the Soul, but abhorred by it, they are not the Souls guilt, yet they muſt be the Souls diſturbance, ſo as under them the Soul will not know how to uphold, and maintain a communion with God as at other times, but its communion is broken, and interrupted, and imperfect; though the Devil can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtain the Soul without its own concurrence, yet he can trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Soul, if God permits him, by his mere ſuggeſtions, and impreſſions, and therefore we had need pray every day, <hi>Lead us not into temptation.</hi> The Devil in this caſe can do as much to a Soul, as a clamorous railing fellow can do to diſturb our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with our friends, though we hearken not much to him, and chide him away, yet he can make a noiſe, and diſturb our communion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Severe outward afflictions may be a cauſe.</hi> Though afflictions be not alwaies indications of Divine Wrath, (for the Apoſtle tells us, that <hi>whom he loveth, he chaſteneth, and ſcourgeth every Child</hi>
                  <pb n="661" facs="tcp:61084:335"/>
                  <hi>whom he receiveth)</hi> yet oftentimes they are ſo, and whether Gods end be to puniſh ſin, or no, yet there is no Soul but is conſcious of ſo much daily guilt, as gives him cauſe to ſuſpect, they are the puniſhments of ſome guilt; and I told you before how apprehenſions of guilt, very ordinarily make the Soul at a loſs how to uphold, and maintain its wonted communion with God. Beſides <hi>afflictions</hi> uſually excite <hi>paſſions,</hi> particularly thoſe of <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>ſorrow;</hi> Both oppoſite to the exerciſes of <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>joy,</hi> and <hi>delight</hi> in God, both diſtracting the Soul in the <hi>ſweet meditations</hi> of God. To this may be added, that the Soul in afflictions, as it ſtandeth in more need of the divine preſence, and influence, ſo it is prone to expect more, or to think it hath nothing. Neither can the Soul under the roilings, and prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of paſſion ſo well diſcern Chriſts communications of himſelf unto it; and beſides, they hinder the Soul in its motions, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications of it ſelf to Chriſt. <hi>I am ſo troubled</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt) that I cannot Speak.</hi> The Soul is ſo troubled, that it cannot believe, it cannot hope, it cannot Pray, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The laſt cauſe that I ſhall aſſign is <hi>diſtractions,</hi> cauſed either from <hi>worldly cares</hi> and <hi>buſineſſes,</hi> or from <hi>ſome falſe guides.</hi> A Soul overwhelmed with buſineſſes and cares of the World, will many times find it ſelf at a loſs how to maintain its communion with God, there is ſuch an oppoſition betwixt a <hi>communion with God,</hi> and <hi>the World,</hi> the firſt being wholly a Spiritual thing, the other wholly of the Earth, earthly, that a man overwhelmed in the World will find the maintaining of this communion difficult, and be more at a loſs to it, then another man more free from theſe incumbrances. Beſides, in the World Chriſtians are ſubject to <hi>diſtractions</hi> from <hi>falſe guides;</hi> one ſaying <hi>loe Chriſt is here;</hi> another ſaying, <hi>loe he is there;</hi> one telling us that the way to have communion with Chriſt is to caſt off <hi>duties,</hi> and <hi>ordinances;</hi> another preſcribing an attendance upon them as the onely means of ſuch communion: One telling them that there is no other communion with Chriſt then with <hi>Chriſt myſtical,</hi> having and keeping in the <hi>communion of his Church,</hi> whereas many may do ſo (if we mean the viſible Church) that have no communion with Chriſt at all. Upon Chriſts <hi>floor</hi> there is <hi>Chaff</hi> as well as <hi>Wheat,</hi> which when Chriſt cometh with his fan thoroughly to purge his floor, ſhall be caſt into unquenchable fire; <hi>tares,</hi> as well as <hi>wheat,</hi> which muſt grow together untill the Harveſt, but then the <hi>Son of man ſhall ſend forth his Angels, and they ſhall gather out of his kingdom, all things that offend, and them which do iniquity, and ſhall caſt them into a</hi>
                  <pb n="662" facs="tcp:61084:336"/>
                  <hi>furnace of fire, where ſhall be wailing, and gnaſhing of teeth, Matth.</hi> 13. 40, 41, 42. Some telling them, that there is no communion with Chriſt, but <hi>by joining with the Prayers of the Church,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Sacrament with the Church, as if an external communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Chriſt, (which <hi>Judas</hi> a Son of perdition had) were all, that men and women need look after. Theſe different notions, and inſtructions ſometimes puzzle the minds of Gods own People and make them to be at a great loſs. I now come to the Application.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Uſe 1.</note> This in the firſt Place lets us ſee what a perpetual uſe, and need there will be of an <hi>able ſtanding Goſpel Miniſtry</hi> and the goodneſs of God, in providing ſuch an ordinance for his Church.

Juſtified and <hi>Sanctified,</hi> yet there would be need of ſuch an Ordinance.

Yea and they had need be <hi>able Miniſters too.</hi> How various are the caſes of Chriſtians, how different one from another? This work is to be done <hi>publickly</hi> which indeed ſerveth for the moſt of Chriſtians, and <hi>privately</hi> alſo, for thoſe who cannot receive Satisfaction from pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick inſtructions. Alas who is ſufficient for theſe things? and how ſlighty a buſineſs is ordinarily made of the greateſt work, the moſt weighty imployment under Heaven? How many <hi>watchmen</hi> are there that like thoſe mentioned in the 3d Chapter of this Song? When the Spouſe of Chriſt comes to them complaining, as <hi>v.</hi> 6. That <hi>her beloved hath withdrawn himſelf, and is gone,</hi> when their <hi>Souls fail,</hi> when they come and tell them, <hi>that they have ſought their beloved, and cannot find him, they have called, but he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them no anſwer,</hi> inſtead of relieving of them, <hi>they ſmite them, &amp; wound them, &amp; take away their vails from them,</hi> they wound them with cruel and envenomed Words, mock and jeer, and revile them, and know not how to <hi>ſpeak a word to the weary,</hi> (indeed not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding what a wearied Soul means) the moſt they are able to ſay is, <hi>what is thy beloved more then anothers beloved?</hi> The Lord pity his flock and give them <hi>Paſtors according to his own heart, who can feed them with wiſdom, and underſtanding,</hi> and will be faithful in doing of it, men <hi>to whom the Lord</hi> God hath given the tongue of the learned, that they may ſpeak a Word in ſeaſon to thoſe that are weary, as he promiſed, <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> 50. 4. There are no more peſtilent enemies to the People of God, then thoſe that would have the flock of Chriſt, without <hi>Shepherds,</hi> or (which it may be is worſe) Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with <hi>Idol Shepherds</hi> (as the Prophet calls them, <hi>Zech.</hi> 11. 17.

                  <note place="margin">Uſe 2.</note> This Notion (Secondly) <hi>may give ſome relief to Souls, whoſe condition this may be.</hi> Here may be ſome before the Lord this day, who are crying out, <hi>where is my God become?</hi> Lord when wilt thou ſtrengthen me? Quicken me? Comfort me? I confeſs the caſe of theſe Chriſtians is ſad, communion with Chriſt is the life of a good Chriſtians life. All the comfort, and Satisfaction of his life is bound up in this one thing, let him want this he wants all, if he be at a loſs as to this, he is quite loſt; this is that which differenceth the true Child of God from an Hypocrite; the profane man lives with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a God in the World, all talk of communion with God is but canting, the thing it ſelf a <hi>Chimera.</hi> The Hypocrites ends cannot be obtained by this courſe of life he taketh up with meer external acts of communion, never regarding whether he hath any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, in, and by thoſe acts, he can live without any preſence of God, without any influence of God upon his Soul: A Child of God cannot, if he wanteth communion with God, he calls all into queſtion, doubteth of his union, and whether he hath not been all this while miſtaken, whether his Soul be yet actually reconciled, and at Peace with God. All that can be ſaid to relieve the Child of God under this complaint, to eaſe him under this burden, is this; That this miſery which befalleth him, is but what is common to the very beſt of men, it is a priviledge reſerved for the Saints in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to live in a not interrupted communion with God. To be ever with the Lord, beholding his face, to live in the ſenſe of ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant communion with Chriſt as doth afford the Soul a perfect Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. The ſublunary Saint is often crying out, <hi>Tell me, O thou whom my</hi> Soul <hi>loveth, where tho u feedeſt.</hi> This diſpenſation indeed will ſpeak thee ſenſibly miſerable, and ſad, but it will not ſpeak thee to have no relation to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Uſe 3.</note> I ſhall ſhut up this diſcourſe with a Word or two of exhortation, <hi>Pleading with you to do what in you lies to avoid ſuch a ſtate, and to keep your ſelves within the knowledg, where Chriſt feedeth, where he makes his flocks to reſt at noon,</hi> 1. Conſider firſt, <hi>That as the Spiritual life of any Soul lyes in its union, and communion with Chriſt:</hi> So <hi>the comfort of his life lyeth in his ſenſe of this communion and knowledge, how at all times, and in all conditions to Support, and to maintain it.</hi> Our Saviour tells us that, <hi>As the branch cannot bring forth fruit unleſs it abide in the Vine, ſo neither can we except we abide in him, John.</hi> 15. 4. That Soul which hath no communion with Chriſt is as certainly dead, as the body is that hath no communion with the head, or
<pb n="665" facs="tcp:61084:337"/>
the branch that hath no communion with the ſtock. Now it is true, <hi>Senſe</hi> is not neceſſary to <hi>Spiritual life. We live</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>by faith, not by ſight.</hi> But the comfort of the Soul doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon ſenſe and knowledge, it is true as to a Chriſtians com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, not to live, and not to know that we live, are much the ſame thing, as to its happineſs, it is not; but I ſay as to his comfort it is; What quiet can a Chriſtian have in his breaſt, what Peace in his conſcience? What joy in the Holy Ghoſt, that feeleth no inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, is ſenſible of no inward communion betwixt his Soul and Chriſt?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hence conſider Secondly, <hi>That to the waky Chriſtian there is no greater miſery upon the Earth then what ariſeth from his apprehenſions of his having no communion with Chriſt.</hi> All the enjoyments of the World will be nothing of Satisfaction to ſuch a Soul, it is an evil—<hi>Nullis medicabilis herbis.</hi> I ſay with a waky ſoul it will be thus; ſome Souls are in a profound ſleep, they never think of <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> never conſider their latter end, they are ignorant, and know not the relation that Chriſt hath to a State of <hi>Eternal happineſs,</hi> that as Eternal life is the gift of God, ſo it is through Chriſt, for that the Father hath given into his hands the Power of Eternal life, and he giveth it to whomſoever he pleaſeth. Now theſe Souls though they have no fellowſhip, no communion at all, yet they have no miſery, no grief from it. But I ſay to the Soul that is awake, to conſider the Grave, the Eternity to which he is haſtening, 'tis the greateſt burden imaginable to lye under apprehenſions, that his <hi>fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip</hi> is not with the Father, and with the <hi>Son Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, conſider <hi>that of all evils, thoſe lye heavieſt, and moſt ſadly upon the Soul, concerning which the man or woman is conſcious, that he himſelf hath been acceſſary to them, and a cauſe of them.</hi> Let a good Chriſtian be at loſs for his communion with God, let the cauſe of it be what it will, he is ſad enough, but if his heart ſmites him that he himſelf hath been the cauſe of it, Oh! inſupportable burden of that reflection! he cannot bear the thoughts of his deſtroying his Soul by his own hands; of this you may make an eaſy judgment by conſidering the frame of your Spirit under ſuch acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, though of a much lighter nature, it is ſad enough for a man to loſe his eſtate, for a Mother to loſe her Child, but for the man to think that he loſt his eſtate, through his own ſupine negligence, or for a Mother to think ſhe hath been the death of her Child: Theſe are wounds healed uſually with great difficulty. So for a
<pb n="666" facs="tcp:61084:338"/>
Soul to think it hath loſt its communion with its dear Lord by its own ſupine negligence, or any voluntary act of its own which it might have avoided. This maketh a deep wound in the Soul. But will ſome ſay, what ſhould, what can we do to uphold our commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Chriſt and to maintain a ſenſe of it? Let me here ſpeak two words.</p>
               <p>The firſt to ſuch as have their <hi>beloved in view,</hi> and do yet injoy deſired communion with him; 2. To ſuch as have loſt this <hi>view,</hi> in order to their recovery of it.</p>
               <p>To the firſt I ſay,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Be much with him whom your Soul loveth.</hi> What the Prophet ſaid of Gods preſence of <hi>Providence</hi> is as true concerning the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God in gracious influences, 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 2. <hi>The Lord is with you while you are with him, if you ſeek him, he will be found of you.</hi> Souls that are much with God ſeldom loſe their ſight of him, ordinarily the Souls of men, and women, firſt withdraw the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications of themſelves unto him through levity, and wantonneſs, then Chriſt withdraweth, both in juſtice, to puniſh in them that le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, and in wiſdom to make them to ſeek after him, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5. 15. <hi>I will go, and return to my place, until they acknowledge their offence, and ſeek my face, in their affliction they will ſeek me early.</hi> That Soul is ſeldom or never at a loſs to know where Chriſt feedeth his flocks, that keepeth a conſtant correſpondence with him. Be much in <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer,</hi> eſpecially <hi>ſecret Prayer,</hi> much in Heavenly meditation, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation; when the Spouſe after her loſs, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3. 1, 2 had found her beloved, <hi>I held him</hi> (ſaith ſhe) <hi>and would not let him go.</hi> How doth the Soul hold Chriſt ſo as ſhe will not let him go, but <hi>by faith,</hi> and conſtant, and frequent acts of fellowſhip and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, <hi>Take heed of grieving the holy Spirit.</hi> It is the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Counſel, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 30. <hi>Grieve not the holy Spirit by which you are ſealed to the day of Redemption.</hi> We maintain our fellowſhip with Chriſt by the Spirit. That takes of Chriſts and giveth to us, and again it takes of ours and giveth to Chriſt, by the Spirit we Pray, by its aſſiſtance we exerciſe <hi>faith,</hi> Love, &amp;c. Chriſt by his Spirit com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municateth himſelf to us, and we by the Spirit do communicate our Souls to him. Take heed therefore you <hi>grieve not this Spirit,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by any preſumptuous ſinnings, or by quenching its motions, or reſiſting its <hi>operations. Let every</hi> Knock, every motion, and impulſe, every impreſſion of the holy Spirit be very valuable to, and regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the Eyes of your Souls.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="667" facs="tcp:61084:338"/>
                  <hi>3. Thirdly,</hi> Maintain in your Souls an high eſtimate of Jeſus Chriſt, and the influences of his grace. <hi>If (ſaith Chriſt)</hi> any man loveth me, I will come to him, and make my abode with him, John <hi>14. 21. The Soul that truly loveth Chriſt ſhall never be ignorant where to find him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Laſtly, <hi>Study holineſs in all manner of converſation.</hi> The Spouſe ſaith that <hi>he feedeth among the Lillies;</hi> the <hi>Lillies</hi> are white, and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Let your apprehenſion of Chriſts withdrawing, the communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of himſelf to your Souls, be no temptation to you to withhold the communications of your ſelves to him, though you may find it more hard, and difficult, and that you cannot do your duty with ſo much eaſe, yet do it. If you cannot do what you would, yet do what you can, if (as you think) you do not, you cannot overtake God, yet let your Souls preſs hard after him.</p>
               <p>But what ſhall be ſaid to that Soul that is at loſs and in ſuch a ſtate as that it doth not know where its Beloved feedeth, where he maketh his flocks to reſt at Noon?</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Let ſuch Souls look for him in the promiſe, where it wants the ſight of him in his Providences.</hi> There <hi>David</hi> found him, when he cryed out, <hi>Remember thy Word, in which thou haſt cauſed me to hope.</hi> The promiſes are <hi>Chriſts place,</hi> when he returneth from a Soul he retreateth no further. All the puniſhment that our tender Lord putteth his Spouſe to ſuffer is to <hi>live by faith, not by ſight.</hi> Chriſt in his <hi>Providences</hi> may appear to a Soul <hi>yea and nay,</hi> ſometimes a friend ſometimes an Enemy. But in his promiſes he is always <hi>yea</hi> and <hi>Amen</hi> the <hi>true and faithful one.</hi> I have already ſhewed you that the <hi>Promiſes</hi> are thoſe <hi>green paſtures</hi> were Chriſt feeds his flocks in the <hi>Noon</hi> of trials and afflictions.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Look for him in ſupporting influences, when you cannot ſee him in comforting and quickening influences.</hi> Chriſt communicateth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf variouſly to the Souls of his People, not always in the ſame me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods or influences, ſee if thou doeſt not feel his <hi>ſtrength,</hi> when thou doeſt not find his <hi>conſolatory manifeſtations;</hi> you have heard that the communion of the believing Soul with Chriſt never ceaſeth, it is only our <hi>ſenſe</hi> that fails, or ſome particular <hi>Manifeſtations</hi> or the degrees of them may abate. We ought therefore to look narrowly to ſee if we cannot find any influences of Chriſt upon our Souls, when it may be we cannot diſcern thoſe which our Eye is moſt upon.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="668" facs="tcp:61084:339"/>
3. Thirdly, <hi>Be as free as you can in your part of this communion, when you cannot diſcern your Lord ſo free in his part.</hi> You may reſt upon this; That Chriſt will never be in your debt, nor be long wanting in his communications of his grace to that Soul that is ready to communicate it ſelf unto him. It may be I or another Soul may not ſee, and diſcern it, but Chriſt is never behind hand with the Soul as to acts of love. Nay we could not be free in communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Souls to him, without his firſt influencing our Souls with ſtrength to ſuch a liberty.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Laſtly take the advice of your beloved in the text. <hi>Go your way by the footſteps of the flock:</hi> And feed your kids by the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds tents. But that leadeth me to the laſt part of the Text, which I called the <hi>Direction</hi> in anſwer to the petition. Of that (if God pleaſe) in my next exerciſe.</p>

Something I muſt touch upon as to both theſe, but I ſhall diſcourſe neither of them in their latitude, having fully done it lately in ſet Diſcourſes upon thoſe Arguments; I ſhall now ſpeak to neither of them further than they relate to the direction of the Text: Being both the ſureſt compaſs for a Chriſtian when he is at loſs, to direct his courſe by, when he is in diſtreſs, and knows not what to do.</p>

               <p>The Propoſition you ſee is concerning Chriſtians <hi>injoying</hi> and <hi>upholding</hi> their <hi>communion</hi> with Chriſt in a day of darkeſt diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in the <hi>Noon of Trials</hi> and <hi>Afflictions.</hi> 2. It directeth a double means in order to this end. 1. <hi>A keeping to the footſteps of the Flock.</hi> 2. <hi>Feeding by the Shepherds Tents.</hi> I ſhall ſpeak to this by way of <hi>Explication, Confirmation,</hi> and <hi>Application.</hi> By way of Explication; the only Queſtion is, What <hi>Flock,</hi> what <hi>Shepherds</hi> are here ſpoken of?</p>
               <p n="1">1. It muſt be <hi>Chriſt's Flock;</hi> that is plain. There are other Flocks in the World, but the Text is doubtleſs to be underſtood of the Flock of Chriſt, which I before ſhewed you was the <hi>Church of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. I think it reaſonable alſo to determine, <hi>That that Flock is here meant, for whoſe feet we have the beſt aſſurance that they were guided and upheld by the unerring Spirit of God.</hi> The <hi>Papiſts</hi> call to us for this, to <hi>keep to the footſteps of the Flock:</hi> But when we come to ask them where that Flock is, they will tell us, it is at <hi>Rome,</hi> where it hath been <hi>kept</hi> and <hi>fed</hi> by a lineal Succeſſion of <hi>Biſhops</hi> from the <hi>Apoſtles times.</hi> The name of the <hi>Church of Chriſt</hi> is an honourable name; this maketh every Party cry out (as the <hi>Jews of old) The Temple of the Lord, The Temple of the Lord are we.</hi> There is ſcarce any company of Hereticks and Sectaries, but lays claim to this name. Neither can this Text be underſtood of all thoſe that are within the Pale of the Viſible Church, which hath in it bad as well as good, but of that <hi>little Flock</hi> only, who <hi>hear Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>follow him,</hi> and thoſe to whom it is <hi>our heavenly Father's will to give a Kingdom,</hi> the footſteps of thoſe who have made the Word a light to their ſeet, and a lamp to their paths; for none can be ſo abſurd as to
<pb n="672" facs="tcp:61084:341"/>
think, that Chriſt here directeth his Spouſe to go her way by the footſteps of thoſe who walk contrary to the will of his Father. Now, where ſhall we find, where can we find thoſe of whom we are ſure they were of this <hi>little Flock?</hi> or, where ſhall we find the certain practice of ſuch, but in the Records of holy Writ? For the <hi>preſent Church of Rome,</hi> thoſe that know the ſecond Commandment, or any of the Revelations of the Divine Will againſt <hi>Idolatry,</hi> muſt know this <hi>Flock</hi> is not to be found there. For the Primitive Church, if they mean the Apoſtolick Church, the Church in their Age, whoſe Story we have Recorded in the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles,</hi> we agree with them, that this is the <hi>Flock</hi> whoſe <hi>footſteps we are to follow,</hi> yet no further than they followed Chriſt. <hi>Be you followers of me</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>as I am of Chriſt;</hi> but for the <hi>following Church</hi> after their Age, we are ſo much at loſs to know what they did, Antichriſt hath ſo trodden out their footſteps, ſo purged and corrupted all Writings that ſhould give us any true account of what the Church did, that we can by no means allow the Record of their practice to be a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Guide to us. We have no ſufficient Evidence of the prints of their feet, in matters wherein the Eternal Salvation of our Souls are concerned. We have a more ſure word of Prophecy, and we are ſure we are not to follow them in any thing wherein they did not follow Chriſt. We conclude then as to this matter, that Chriſt in theſe words intended to give his Spouſe a certain Rule, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ſteps of thoſe whom they might be ſure it was <hi>Chriſt's Flock,</hi> and whoſe footſteps might be ſeen. This <hi>Flock</hi> can be only that, the print of whoſe feet we have in the unerring Word of God. We believe that in all Ages of the World Chriſt hath had a Flock, a number that have heard his voice, and followed him, to whom he hath given, and will give Eternal Life, but they have been under various diſpenſations, ſometimes more, and ſometimes leſs perſpicuous to the World. We believe that it hath been the deſign of <hi>Rome</hi> ever ſince the Myſtery of Iniquity began to work in it, to blot out the prints of the feet of the Flock of Chriſt in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times; we therefore reaſonably in purſuit of this Direction of Chriſt's, overlook the Churches of this, and former Ages. The pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of thoſe of <hi>Rome</hi> in this and late ages we know to be directly contrary to the Word of God. The practice of the <hi>Primitive Church in former ages</hi> we are incertain of, further then what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in holy writ, we know that it hath been the policy of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> to blot out all the records of thoſe times which might make
<pb n="673" facs="tcp:61084:341"/>
againſt them, any thing that might ſhew us that the <hi>Doctrine, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip &amp; Diſcipline</hi> of the Church in thoſe ages was different from their preſent practices, we know that the records of the Primitive Churches practice (excepting that in the Apoſtles time recorded in Scripture) have been moſtly in their hands and they have blotted out, and put in what they pleaſed, to juſtify their <hi>Idolatry and Superſtitions,</hi> we therefore call <hi>to the Law</hi> and <hi>to the Teſtimony;</hi> to the holy Scriptures; we are ſure they have not been kept in their hands onely, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them the pure Word of God. We ſay there is no other cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain rule, no other unqueſtionable record of the footſteps of the flock: We know they are able to make the man of God wiſe to ſalvation. thoroughly furniſhed to every good work. All Proteſtants acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg them a perfect rule as to matter of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> we ſay they alſo are ſo as to <hi>Worſhip</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> and as to all our converſation. We know the practice of the Saints, and Servants of God in holy Writ (not reproved by it) are the <hi>footſteps</hi> of <hi>Chriſts flock,</hi> for others we know not, we are ſure if they were contrary to the <hi>footſteps</hi> of the Servants of God in holy Writ, they are no footſteps of the flock of Chriſt, which <hi>hears his voice,</hi> and owneth that only, and will not follow ſtrangers.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As to the <hi>Shepherds</hi> mentioned in the Text, We know Chriſt is the <hi>true Shepherd,</hi> the <hi>chief Shepherd.</hi> He <hi>feedeth his Flock like a Shepherd.</hi> He aſcending up into Heaven, hath betruſted his Flock to <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Teachers,</hi> to Under-Shepherds, we know that if theſe be <hi>Chriſts Shepherds,</hi> they muſt take, and follow Chriſt's directions, and they are no further <hi>Shepherds</hi> then they do ſo. He hath indeed betruſted to ſome his Goſpel, the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration both of the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and the <hi>Ordinances of the Goſpel;</hi> As they are to publiſh no other Doctrine, ſo they are to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe no other Rules of life, either for the <hi>Worſhip of God,</hi> or <hi>government of the Church,</hi> they have no <hi>legiſlative power in the Church</hi> committed to them; only an <hi>executive power,</hi> to execute thoſe Laws, thoſe Ordinances, which Chriſt the Supreme <hi>Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd,</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> which were his firſt Commiſſioners have left. This is the truſt which Chriſt hath committed to them, in the diſcharge of which alone, they can be faithful, they are not the <hi>Miniſters of men,</hi> but the <hi>Miniſters of Chriſt.</hi> By the <hi>Tents of thoſe Shepherds</hi> who do this all Chriſtians are bound to ab de, and to feed themſelves, neither caſting off <hi>Divine inſtitutions,</hi> nor <hi>ſubmitting</hi> to <hi>humane inſtitutions</hi> contrary to the Divine rule;
<pb n="674" facs="tcp:61084:342"/>
and if the Divine rule be a perfect rule, whatſoever is beſides it is contrary to it, for it reproacheth it with imperfection, or elſe is meerly, idle, and Superfluous.</p>
               <p>That this is the duty of Chriſtians, will appear both from the the conſideration of the end for which God hath left us the footſteps of the flock in holy Writ, and alſo from comparing this with other courſes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Let us firſt conſider the <hi>end for which God hath leſt us the footſteps of his flock in holy Writ, and when he aſcended up on high, gave gifts unto men, and amongſt others Paſtors and Teachers.</hi> The footſteps of the flock of Chriſt are to be found in the Word of God, you have in Scripture not onely the inſtructions of <hi>David,</hi> the words of the man according to Gods own heart, but the <hi>practice of</hi> David <hi>recorded</hi> under ſeveral circumſtances: Not onely the Doctrine, and inſtructions of the Apoſtles in their <hi>Sermons,</hi> and <hi>Epiſtles,</hi> but the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles</hi> teaching us their practice. Now though it be true, that their <hi>examples</hi> oblige us in nothing wherein they did not follow the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, nor in any thing which they did in conformity to the <hi>Ceremonial law,</hi> wherein they uſed a liberty (that law being dead with Chriſt, but through a gracious indulgence, allowed, for a time, till the believing Jews could be Satisfied concerning the <hi>abolition</hi> of it, in order to the gaining the Jews, and walking towards them without offence, upon which account <hi>Paul</hi> both circumciſed <hi>Timothy</hi> and purified himſelf. Nor are their exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples our rules, in what they did as <hi>Apoſtles</hi> or as men indued with the extraordinary gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>working miracles</hi> or <hi>ſpeaking with tongues;</hi> for as we cannot do the latter, ſo we want their <hi>miſſion</hi> and more extraordinary commiſſion to do the former. Hence Miniſters are under no obligation to do as they did, fixing no where, but going up and down preaching the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and ſettling Churches: yet in other things, wherein they acted as Miniſters of the Goſpel, or private Chriſtians, we are bound to the imitation of them, and God hath left us their actions upon ſacred record for our inſtruction. <hi>For whatſoever is written aforetime is written for our learning, Rom.</hi> 15. 4. The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> telleth us, <hi>That all Scripture is given by inſpiration of God and is profitable for Doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in righteouſneſs.</hi> This is the end for which God hath given us the Scripture, and all the Scripture, 2 <hi>Tim,</hi> 3. 16.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="675" facs="tcp:61084:342"/>
2. It is the moſt <hi>ſafe</hi> and <hi>certain</hi> rule. The two great things that commend a <hi>rule</hi> given with reference to any end is the <hi>ſecurity of it,</hi> and the <hi>certainty</hi> of it. To walk by the <hi>footſteps</hi> of Chriſts <hi>flock</hi> recorded in Scripture muſt be a <hi>ſafe rule,</hi> no man needeth fear ſinning againſt God, by <hi>obeying his Word,</hi> and living up to the rule, <hi>direction,</hi> and preſcription of it, ſin muſt be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing contrary to the <hi>Divine Rule.</hi> In following other <hi>rules</hi> men <hi>may err,</hi> in following of this rule they cannot err. The <hi>certainty,</hi> of a rule much commends it. If the Trumpet give an incertain ſound who ſhall prepare himſelf for the battel? If there be no certainty in a rule who can follow the direction of it? Let us now compare this <hi>rule</hi> as to this caſe what a <hi>Chriſtian is to do,</hi> eſpecially in a time of <hi>affliction and diſtreſs,</hi> to maintain and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his <hi>communion with Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Some will pretend to the Spirit as their rule. They have an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing</hi> (they tell us) <hi>which teacheth them all things,</hi> and ſo pretend to follow the <hi>motions, and impreſſions of the holy Spirit. But</hi> there is no <hi>certainty in</hi> this pretended Rule for all Spirits are not of God. The Spirit hath given us the Rule of the word, for you heard before, <hi>That all Scripture is given us by divine inſpiration,</hi> and that it is able to <hi>make the man of God wiſe to Salvation.</hi> The Spirit teacheth nothing contrary to the Word. The Word directs us to follow the <hi>footſteps of the Flock.</hi> There can be no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty in pretended impreſſions from the Spirit which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Word of God, no nor any <hi>ſecurity.</hi> For all ſuch pretences muſt Iſſue in the deceit of our own hearts, we follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our own luſts, and imaginations in ſtead of the holy Spirit, or (which is worſe) the impreſſions of the <hi>evil Spirit.</hi> Yet this is the rule of all Enthuſiaſts.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Others call out to us to follow the <hi>Church,</hi> the <hi>practice of the Church in all ages.</hi> And indeed if they could make appear to us what that was, they would ſay ſomething, but what certainty can there be in this rule while they that talk of it, can neither make that Church appear to us, nor yet what their practice was; we know who were the Church, in the Apoſtles age, and we know what their practice was, by the records of holy Writ, but who the Church were, and what their practice was in latter ages we cannot tell, and by conſequence there is no certainty in this rule, we may follow the <hi>ſteps</hi> of the <hi>Synagogue of Sat an</hi> inſtead of the ſteps of the flock of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="676" facs="tcp:61084:343"/>
3. The <hi>Papiſts</hi> call to us to follow <hi>Traditions,</hi> and indeed for the Traditions delivered us by the Apoſtles we ſee reaſon to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them, and if they could by an unqueſtionable record make out any thing to us, which had been received as an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church,</hi> we ſhould have a great reſpect and reverence for it, but for <hi>unwritten Traditions,</hi> which the <hi>Papiſts</hi> put into an equal ballance with the Word of God for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians rule, being (as they pretend) delivered as rules by the Apoſtles to the Church of God, as we know no need we have of ſuch, ſo we have no <hi>certainty</hi> that any ſuch things were ever ſo delivered and therefore can ſee no ſecurity in receiving them, or giving any ear unto them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There is a 4th ſort, that in diſtreſſes are much <hi>for ſeeking God, and walking according to the impreſſions we have upon ſuch ſeeking;</hi> this practice is founded upon an excellent bottom: 1. A <hi>Precept</hi> for the owning, and acknowledging of God in all our ways. 2. A <hi>Promiſe that he will direct our ſteps, Prov.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 6. Seeking of God at all times, (at ſuch times eſpecially) is the great duty of Chriſtians, and if rightly done, cannot be in vain, but for the right performance of it, a Chriſtian muſt have reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect both to the <hi>matter of his Prayer,</hi> and alſo to the <hi>manner of it.</hi> It is to the <hi>matter of our Prayers</hi> onely that I am here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to ſpeak. As to this our rule is, that <hi>it muſt be ſomething conſonant to the will of God.</hi> I mean his will revealed in his Word. Hence it followeth,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That when God hath revealed his will in his Word for, or againſt a thing which we are about to do, for us to ſeek God, whether we ſhould do it or no, forbear it or no, is to tempt and provoke God.</hi> This is like <hi>Balaams</hi> going to inquire of God whether he ſhould go with the Meſſengers of <hi>Balak,</hi> after that God had plainly told him he ſhould not go. We ought to acquieſce in the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Gods will in his Word, whether in the Precepts or the examples of the Servants of God recorded there, and for things forbidden to avoid them, for things commanded to do them; here's no place for ſeeking God as to the doing or forbearing; ſo that although for things of this nature, as to what God hath commanded us to do, we may, and ought to ſeek God for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, help, and aſſiſtance in the doing of them: And as to things forbidden we may <hi>ſeek God</hi> for ſtrength to avoid them, and all temptations to them, yet we may not ſeek God whether
<pb n="677" facs="tcp:61084:343"/>
we ſhould do the things ſo commanded, and forbear the things ſo forbidden yea or no. Such ſeeking of God is but asking leave to ſin againſt him.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2. In</hi> particular actions <hi>as to which Gods</hi> Word <hi>hath not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly directed us, it is our duty to</hi> ſeek God <hi>for</hi> direction, and having firſt well conſidered the general rules of the Word of God, if we find the action neither commanded nor forbidden, according to them we may, for ought I know, attend the impreſſions we find upon our Spirits, after ſuch ſincere and ſerious ſeeking of God. And take them to be the will of God concerning us as to ſuch actions. <hi>But this is but a digreſſion from my ſubject. This is enough to ſhew you, there is no ſuch</hi> ſecurity, <hi>or certainty in any direction we can have, as in following the</hi> footſteps of the flock <hi>of Chriſt, the prints of whoſe feet we find in the Word of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It is as reaſonable that we ſhould feed by the <hi>Shepherds Tents,</hi> that is, attend upon <hi>Divine inſtitutions,</hi> if we would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy any <hi>fellowſhip, and communion with God;</hi> for it is unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to expect the influences of Divine Grace in any way, but ſuch only as God hath promiſed he will give them in, much leſs in the neglect, or contempt of any ſuch means as he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. The promiſe is, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 24. <hi>In all places where I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord my name, I will come unto thee, and bleſs thee.</hi> Our commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God depends upon his <hi>coming to us, and bleſſing us.</hi> Where God will come unto us, and bleſs us, there we may, there we ſhall have communion with him. Now where will <hi>God come unto us, and bleſs us? In all places where he recordeth his Name to dwell;</hi> what doth that ſignify but in all his ſacred ordinances, and inſtitutions? Conformable to this is his promiſe in the New Teſtament, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 20. <hi>Where two or three are gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in my name</hi> (that is, at my command, or by my order) <hi>there am I in the midſt amongſt them,</hi> and to his Miniſters his promiſe is made, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Go you therefore, and teach all Nations, Baptizing them in the Name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt, teaching them to obſerve all things whatſoever I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded you, and loe I am with you alway, to the end of the world.</hi> Where can we expect communion with God, but where he hath promiſed to be with his People, to meet them, and to bleſs them?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Uſe 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Obſerve from hence how unreaſonable they are that</hi> talk of a communion with God, or expect any ſuch thing, who make not the
<pb n="678" facs="tcp:61084:344"/>
Word of God a light to their Feet, who go not forth by the footſteps of the flock, who feed not their Souls by the Shepherds Tents: <hi>under this condemnation fall,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> All ſuch who having no regard to the Word as their rule, walk according to the imaginations of their own hearts, <hi>which you ſhall find to be the conſtant Character of wicked Men in Scripture.</hi>

               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> Such as follow the incertain examples, and traditions of men.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Laſtly, <hi>Such as caſt off ordinances under a pretence of a more immediate fellowſhip, and communion with God.</hi> There is a middle way betwixt reſting in, and taking up with mere external per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, and <hi>caſting them off.</hi> It is true, a Soul may wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God in ordinances, and have no communion with God in them. Communion with God lies in more then meer lending an Ear to God, and allowing him our bodily preſence, in more then a communication of the will of God to our external ſenſes: but this is to be had by the <hi>Shepherds Tents,</hi> in places where <hi>God hath recorded his Name to dwell,</hi> and the performance of ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal acts, as God hath required, and made his promiſes of that nature unto. To look for a preſence of God with us in a neglect, or contempt of theſe inſtitutions, is to look for what we have no reaſon to expect to find.</p>

As it was prophecied of old, that there ſhould come times when many ſhould ſay, <hi>Lo here is Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>lo there is Chriſt,</hi> to amuſe Souls, and make their way incertain to them. So the times are come. when many ſay, <hi>Lo here is the Church,</hi> others ſay, <hi>lo it is there,</hi> the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſay it is with them, and other parties ſay it is with them, in this incertain cry we have a certain rule.

But we ought to do nothing for which we have <hi>not a particular, or general Warrant from the Word of God.</hi> In fome actions (thoſe eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly which relate to the Worſhip of God) the Word of God is a <hi>particular rule in all things.</hi> No act of Worſhip, no mean of Worſhip is to be uſed, but what we have a particular Warrant in Gods Word; the reaſon is, becauſe there is all the reaſon in the World God ſhould preſcribe his own Homage, and becauſe it is a <hi>ſufficient rule,</hi> he that worſhippeth God according to the rules of the Word, neither adding thereto, nor diminiſhing therefrom, ſhall worſhip God <hi>acceptably.</hi> As to particular, <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi> and <hi>civil actions,</hi> the word is not a <hi>particular ſufficient rule,</hi> but it is <hi>a general rule;</hi> it is impoſſible that the Word of God ſhould particularly direct all the <hi>civil</hi> actions of a mans life, it hath left a thouſand things of that nature to our own <hi>liberty and wiſdom,</hi> only hath given us ſome <hi>general rules,</hi> which we are to obſerve in them; in theſe things a Chriſtian hath not ſuch a liberty, but that he ought to obey the Ordinances, and laws of men, ſo far as they reſpect the order and government of Nations and Kingdoms, and that out of conſcience to the <hi>Commandment of God,</hi> requiring ſuch obedience to men in their Spheres, and the capacities which God hath ſet them in.</p>

Secondly, <hi>Feed your Kids by the Shepherds Tents.</hi> Keep to the <hi>Ordinances, and Inſtitutions of Chriſt,</hi> adminiſtred by thoſe whom he hath ſet over his flock as <hi>Shepherds.</hi> That is the ſenſe of that part of the direction, and by the way this ſheweth us a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, and uſefulneſs of a <hi>Goſpel Miniſtry.</hi> It is the deſign of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites,</hi> and <hi>Romiſh Prieſts</hi> to take you off from your Miniſters. The <hi>Socinian</hi> complaineth, that the world hath been a long time troubled with an idle ſort of Perſons called <hi>Miniſters, Quakers,</hi> and other <hi>Enthuſiaſts,</hi> all ſing the ſame Song, yet there is none of theſe but have their Heads, their Guides, and Teachers, only poſſibly ſome of them would have none who ſhould wholly ſet themſelves apart, and give up themſelves to this work, others would only bring you off the true Miniſters of the Goſpel, to put you under <hi>Idol Shepherds.</hi> Certain it is that the Shepherds mentioned in the Text are ſuch as are ſent by the great Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, and can truly derive from the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Here is the queſtion <hi>how ſhall we know which be the Shepherds tents,</hi> our reaſon will direct us not to give credit to thoſe who only bear witneſs of themſelves, Chriſt ſaith, <hi>John.</hi> 5. 31. <hi>If I bear witneſs of my ſelf my witneſs is not true:</hi> That is, if I alone bear witneſs of my ſelf. Such a Teſtimony is alſo more to be ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when it is arrogant, when men challenge to themſelves to be alone the <hi>true Shepherds.</hi> But for your direction I ſhall lay down a few concluſions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It is both impoſſible for any to know them by their lineal ſucceſſion from the Apoſtles, who were the firſt deputed by Chriſt to feed his flock, and needleſs to make ſuch an inquiry for them.</hi> The former aſſertion proveth the latter, for it is doubtleſs needleſs to look for what is impoſſible to be found. This is the great thing which the <hi>Papiſts</hi> boaſt of, the great thing which they contend for, That thoſe can be no true Miniſters who are not ordained by <hi>Biſhops</hi> in a <hi>lineal ſucceſſion</hi> or a <hi>perſonal ſucceſſion from the Apoſtles, &amp; Rome</hi> hath only had ſuch a ſucceſſion, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Shepherds</hi> Tents, are only to be found amongſt them. I am ſorry to find any <hi>Proteſtants</hi> liſping this language of <hi>Aſhdod; Proteſtant Divines</hi> in former ages have thought it enough to prove <hi>ſucceſſion in Doctrine.</hi> The truth is a ſucceſſion of Perſons is a thing impoſſible to be proved, if we muſt own no Miniſters, but ſuch as can prove they are made ſo by <hi>Biſhops, in a true ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion from the Apoſtles,</hi> I am ſure they muſt own none at all, for
<pb n="681" facs="tcp:61084:345"/>
how is it poſſible think you that after near 1700 years, any Miniſters ſhould be able to prove ſuch a ſucceſſion. All the Iſſue of this conteſt muſt be either to bring us all again to <hi>Rome,</hi> which indeed vainly boaſteth of ſuch a ſucceſſion, or elſe to <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> to the owning of no true Miniſtry at all, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to no <hi>Ordinances.</hi> Nor is any ſuch inquiry neceſſary, for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly Chriſt hath clothed his Church with a power to reſtore his inſtitutions if they were loſt, or the exerciſe of them for any ſpace of time were interrupted.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, The <hi>true Shepherds are to be known by their miſſion.</hi> Chriſt is agreed to be the <hi>true Shepherd,</hi> the principal <hi>Shepherd.</hi> All true Under-Shepherds muſt have their miſſion from him. He certainly ſendeth none but, 1. <hi>Such as are by him fitted and qualified for all parts of their work.</hi> 2. Such as are <hi>diſpoſed, &amp; inclined</hi> to <hi>their work.</hi> Conſider but what the work of the <hi>Shepherd</hi> is, <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>ſeed the flock</hi> of Chriſt, to <hi>watch over them,</hi> &amp;c. And this is one way for you to know Chriſts <hi>Shepherds,</hi> they are by him qualified for their work with gifts and abilities to pray, and Preach, to open, and to apply the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, they are alſo by him <hi>inclined</hi> and <hi>diſpoſed to it,</hi> deſiring the Office of a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> and to give up themſelves to it. Where this is found, there's <hi>Chriſts Miſſion.</hi> They are alſo <hi>called by the Church,</hi> proved, ſet apart to the work by <hi>faſting and Prayer,</hi> but this is onely their external miſſion. A Church may be ſo corrupted as to ſend out men who were never ſent of Chriſt, neither having any <hi>internal qualifications to fit them for it,</hi> nor <hi>any inclinations, and heart unto</hi> it, only deſiring to be put into the Prieſts Office for a <hi>morſel of bread.</hi> No good Chriſtian can judg theſe <hi>Chriſts Shepherds,</hi> for though he hath given a power to his Church to ſend out Miniſters, yet they are limited to ſuch as are <hi>able and faithful,</hi> nor ought any to be look'd upon as a true Shepherd or Miniſter of Chriſt, who apparently hath no inward qualifications for the work of the Miniſtry nor any heart faithfully to diſcharge it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, You ſhall know them <hi>by their Doctrine,</hi> Gal. 1. 8. <hi>Though we or an Angel from Heaven Preach any other Goſpel unto you, then that which we have Preached unto you, let him be accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, v.</hi> 9. <hi>As we ſaid before ſo now I ſay again, If any man Preach any other Goſpel unto you, then that you have received, let him be accurſed.</hi> He that is <hi>accurſed,</hi> or to be accurſed, is none
<pb n="682" facs="tcp:61084:346"/>
of thoſe <hi>Shepherds,</hi> by whoſe Tents Chriſtians are to feed their Souls, but thoſe who bring any Doctrine to Peoples Ears, that is contrary to the Doctrine delivered by Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, or other then that, is accurſed, and by the Judgment of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> to be accounted <hi>accurſed;</hi> ſuch a one therefore, can be no ſuch Perſon as Chriſtians are bound to hear, or to feed their Souls by their Tents. But you will ſay, <hi>what if they be not declared ſo or adjudged ſo, by the Church.</hi> This is the Churches ſin and neglect of their duty. The Church by its judgments cannot make one hair of truth <hi>white</hi> or <hi>black,</hi> ſhe is only to declare and adjudg that to be the Doctrine of Chriſt which is ſo: And to declare and adjudg that which is not ſo to be what it is. If the Church will neglect her duty I am not to neglect mine. If the Major part of the Church be ſo corrupted, that they will call evil good, and good evil, determine Error to be truth, and truth to be Error, their Error cannot conclude me. If it could, we had long ſince been <hi>Arrians,</hi> and in later times been <hi>Papiſts. Proteſtants</hi> have therefore rightly determined that every true <hi>Chriſtian</hi> hath a <hi>judgment</hi> of <hi>diſcretion</hi> in this caſe. The ſole judgment of truth &amp; Error is in Chriſt and his Word. A declarative judgment is in the Church, but a <hi>judgment of diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> ſo far as to guide a Chriſtians particular practice, is in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Chriſtian, who is to <hi>prove all things,</hi> and <hi>to hold faſt that only</hi> which is good. I cannot, I ought not to feed my Soul by the Tents of thoſe Shepherds, who bring me other <hi>Doctrine</hi> then what they can prove from the Word of God. If the Church will ſuffer ſuch, I am not bound by their ſins. Gods Paſtors <hi>feed his People with wiſdom and underſtanding, Jer.</hi> 3. 15. Not with meet high-ſwelling Words of vanity, much leſs with lies and Erronious Doctrine contrary to Chriſts and the Apoſtles Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Chriſt tells us that to the true Shepherd, <hi>the Porter openeth, John</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 3. And the <hi>Sheep hear his voice.</hi> God opens the hearts of his People to ſuch as are his <hi>Shepherds.</hi> The Apoſtle tells the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> they were the <hi>ſeal of his Apoſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 2. And again, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 2, 3. <hi>Ye are our Epiſtle, Written in our hearts, and known, and read of all men, for as much as you are manifeſtly declared to be the Epiſtle of Chriſt Miniſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by us, Written, not with Ink, but with the Spirit of the living God, not in tables of ſtone, but in the fleſhly tables of the heart.</hi> God
<pb n="683" facs="tcp:61084:346"/>
hath ſealed the miniſtry of thoſe Miniſtersto be from him, whoſe miniſtry he hath bleſſed, by opening the hearts of People to it, and by it; there needs no further evidence, this is a ſufficient let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of recommendation of them to all that own the name of Chriſt. I ſpeak not here for that inſignificant converſion of men to an <hi>opinion,</hi> without a turning of their heart from ſin unto God, but of the <hi>real converſion</hi> or <hi>change</hi> of mens hearts. This is a proof Sirs, of true <hi>Shepherds</hi> a proof of a true miniſtry, 2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 13. 3. I will never queſtion the truth of that mans miniſtry, with whoſe miniſtry I ſee God going along. So that their mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry <hi>opens the Eyes of the blind,</hi> and <hi>turns men from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive forgiveneſs of ſins, and an inheritance amongſt them that are Sanctified. Which were the ends for which God ſent out Paul, Acts</hi> 26. 18. Let ſuch men as theſe be ordained by whom they will, <hi>Biſhops</hi> or <hi>Preſbyters,</hi> or <hi>only ſent out by the Church,</hi> let them be ordained by what Rites and in what manner they will, it is plain they are Chriſts Shepherds. Let there have been defects in their entrance, and admiſſion by the Church into the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry. God hath now ſealed their miniſtry, all defects are taken away.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Our Saviour hath given us another note of a true Shepherd, <hi>John</hi> 10. 4. <hi>When he putteth forth his Sheep he goeth before them,</hi> he <hi>doth not</hi> only lead them by his voice but by his feet. I ſhall never believe that Chriſt ſent an <hi>open Drunkard</hi> to perſuade men not to <hi>be drunk with wine wherein is exceſs,</hi> nor a <hi>Scandalous</hi> and <hi>unclean Perſon</hi> to tell men <hi>that Whoremon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and Adulterers God will judge.</hi> Nor a <hi>profane Swearer</hi> to Preach to men, <hi>Swear not at all.</hi> Chriſt indeed did ſend out <hi>Judas,</hi> but he was under no <hi>Scandalous Character</hi> till he betrayed his Maſter. A <hi>ſecret Hypocrite,</hi> whom we do not diſcern may be judged by <hi>us ſent of Chriſt.</hi> But a Scandalous profane Perſon can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not. The Church ought to caſt out ſuch unſavoury ſalt; if ſhe neglects her duty, I ought not to neglect mine: I am bound to feed by no ſuch Shepherds Tents.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The <hi>true Shepherds of Chriſt will not traduce, and revile one another,</hi> the falſe Apoſtles traduced <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> as an hireling, and a weak man, &amp;c. you read not that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> &amp;c. ever did ſo, there was ſome hot Conteſts betwixt <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> but
<pb n="684" facs="tcp:61084:347"/>
they never ended in revilings, and ſeeking of a proof of Chriſt one in another. In ſhort, if you ſee any Miniſters who are able to <hi>Pray</hi> and <hi>Preach,</hi> and <hi>faithful in doing it,</hi> and who in Preaching mind the Souls of the People, and feed them not with the air of a few fine Words: Nor with rotten, and corrupt Doctrines. Any whom the Lord owneth, making them bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed inſtruments to turn Souls to God, any who walk before their flock, who live up to what they Preach in all holineſs of life, conclude theſe are the Shepherds Tents by which Chriſt hath commanded you to feed, if you would have any commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him. Regard not what <hi>Romiſh Prieſts ſay,</hi> that they have no <hi>Apoſtolical Succeſſion;</hi> no what <hi>Enthuſiaſts</hi> ſay, that they are <hi>wirelings,</hi> therefore none of <hi>Chriſts Shepherds.</hi> He is no hireling that receiveth wages, for <hi>the labourer</hi> is by God deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined <hi>worthy of his hire.</hi> He is an <hi>hireling</hi> in the ſenſe of Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 10. that regards not the Souls of People, and <hi>looks at nothing but his hire.</hi> I ſhall only preſs your feeding by the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds Tents,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>From the former advantages you have had from your Souls feeding there.</hi> I ſhall allude to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Galat.</hi> 3. 2, 3. This only would I know of you, were not you converted from ſin unto God by the Miniſters of Chriſt, by ſuch Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds, as I have been deſcribing to you? Were your hearts firſt changed, by thoſe that declaim againſt Miniſters and Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider <hi>the moful Examples of thoſe who have caſt off the Miniſtry and Ordinances of God.</hi> What horrors have filled the Souls of ſome? What <hi>ſtupid blindneſs have others fallen into?</hi> How many of them are delivered up by God to ſtrong deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to believe lies, or to a looſneſs of life and converſation, to commit iniquity with greedineſs, and that without any appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſenſe or feeling. I could give you ſeveral, ſtrange inſtances, but I ſhall rather chuſe to leave you to be informed by your own Obſervation.</p>

               <p>You read in holy Writ, of <hi>Fellow-Citizens,</hi> and <hi>Fellow-Heirs, Eph.</hi> 2. 19. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 6. of <hi>Fellow-helpers,</hi> and <hi>fellow-labourers,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 23. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. 2. of <hi>fellow priſoners,</hi> and <hi>fellow ſouldiers, Col.</hi> 4. 10. <hi>Philemon</hi> 23. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 25.

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Chriſt is with his Saints a Fellow-Citizen in the City of their God.</hi> The City of God ſignifieth either the Church of God, or Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.

<pb n="688" facs="tcp:61084:349"/>
fellow-members of the ſame Body. The Mayor of your City, thô the moſt dignified Citizen, yet is a Fellow-Citizen. The Saints are all <hi>Fellow-Citizens, Eph.</hi> 3. 6. Chriſt, though their Head, is their Fellow-Citizen; he calls them <hi>Brethren, Heb.</hi> 2. 11, 12. ſaying, <hi>I will declare thy Name unto my Brethren; in the midſt of the Church, I will ſing praiſe unto thee.</hi> Do Fellow-Citizens dwell in a <hi>City compacted</hi> together? Chriſt dwells in his Church: He walks in the midſt of the <hi>Golden Candleſticks:</hi> He <hi>dwelleth</hi> in the Believing Soul; his dwelling-place is in <hi>Zion, in his holy Mountain,</hi> Zech. 2. 11. <hi>I will dwell in the midſt of thee.</hi> He ſaith, He will make his abode with the Soul that <hi>loveth him, and keepeth his Commandments; I in you, and you in me,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.

But the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a <hi>Fellow-Citizen</hi> ſpeaketh more than Cohabitation: A <hi>Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerſhip in the ſame Rights and Priviledges.</hi> So doth a <hi>Co-heirſhip</hi> ſpeak a Partnerſhip in the <hi>ſame Enjoyments.</hi> Thus Chriſt is their <hi>Fellow-Citizen,</hi> their <hi>Fellow-Heir;</hi> they are Partners with Chriſt in the ſame Priviledges, in the ſame Enjoyments. <hi>Of his fulneſs they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive grace for grace.</hi> And for the New <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the City of God which is above, he hath willed them a Partnerſhip with him in his glory, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 22. <hi>And the glory which thou haſt given me, I have given them, that they may be one, even as we are one.</hi> Only there is this obſervable difference, <hi>Fellow-Citizens,</hi> and <hi>Fellow-Heirs amongſt men,</hi> are Notions which denote an equality in <hi>Priviledges</hi> and <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments,</hi> but not ſo between Chriſt and us.

                  <hi>work.</hi> What is the work of Believers, but to <hi>glorifie God?</hi> This is their great buſineſs. <hi>Whether</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>you eat, or drink, or whatſoever you do, let all be done to the glory of God.</hi> What was the work of Chriſt while he was upon the Earth? <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 4. <hi>I have glorified thee on the Earth, I have finiſhed the work thou gaveſt me to do:</hi> Chriſt and his Diſciples have in the general one and the ſame work, to <hi>glorifie God.</hi> Though, if we come to ſpeak of the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar actions by which God is glorified by the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and by the Believer, there is a great deal of difference. Chriſt glorified his Father by performance of the acts of our Redemption, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Fathers Will, we by thoſe good works which he hath commanded; yet in the general ſcope, <hi>viz. the glorifying of God,</hi> and the more <hi>general mean</hi> by which this general End is attained, <hi>viz. obedience to the Will of God,</hi> they are both the ſame; Chriſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied his Father, by <hi>obedience to his Will:</hi> The Child of God glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth God by obedience to his Will; both of them glorified God by the praedication of his Name, by praiſing him, &amp;c. Chriſt took up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him the form of a Servant, and became obedient, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 7, 8. The Child of God is <hi>by Birth a Servant,</hi> and <hi>by Covenant a Servant;</hi> (there is that difference betwixt them) but they are both <hi>Servants,</hi> both obedient to the Will of God, and both by that <hi>obedience</hi> ſerve the great End of <hi>glorifying God,</hi> which juſtifieth the Notion, though the <hi>Acts of their obedience</hi> differ according to their ſeveral <hi>ſpheres</hi> and <hi>ſtations.</hi> In a great Family you know they are all fellow-ſervants, though ſome of them have a more, ſome a leſs noble Imployment.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Chriſt is their <hi>Fellow-worker,</hi> their <hi>Fellow-helper,</hi> not only with reference to the Father, as they both work to the ſame End, and by the ſame general Means, <hi>viz. obedience to the Will of God,</hi> but as he worketh in them, and excites their habits of grace, and ſtrengtheneth them in the exerciſe of them, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 13. <hi>I can do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengtheneth me,</hi> Phil. 4. 13. <hi>Without me you can do nothing,</hi> Joh. 15. 3.

                  </gap>, it lifts over againſt them. The Child of God, without the <hi>preſence</hi> and <hi>aſſiſtance</hi> of Chriſt, cannot pray a prayer, nor <hi>hear a Sermon,</hi> nor perform any ſpiritual duty; ſo as that Chriſt is not only to the Believer a <hi>Fellow labourer,</hi> and <hi>Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervant,</hi> doing the ſame work that they do, or at leaſt having done the ſame work, but he is their <hi>Fellow-helper</hi> as to all their own ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual <hi>Motions</hi> and <hi>Actions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. You in holy Scripture read of a <hi>Fellow-Priſoner, Ariſtarchus,</hi>

This Notion ſignifieth one that is a Partner and Fellow to another in Conflicts, Combates, &amp;c. a common Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerſhip in <hi>hazards</hi> and <hi>ſufferings.</hi> In this ſenſe our Lord properly calleth his Spouſe (the <hi>Believing Soul)</hi> his <hi>Fellow.</hi> He fought and overcame the ſame Enemies with whom they daily fight. The Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian hath three great Enemies; the <hi>World,</hi> the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</hi> It is true, Chriſt had none of the ſecond to incounter; he was born without ſin; he lived without ſin; he <hi>had no body of death.</hi> But yet he had to die for our ſins; all our ſins were ſet in Battel Array againſt him; they were thoſe which nailed him to the Croſs, but he conquered, and declared his <hi>Conqueſt,</hi> by his <hi>Reſurrection from the dead.</hi> The World is our Enemy, one of thoſe Enemies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which we are to maintain the Spiritual Fight. It was alſo his Enemy, he fought againſt it, and overcame it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 33.—<hi>Be of good cheer, I have overcome the World.</hi> The <hi>Devil</hi> is another of our great Enemies, againſt whom we are commanded to put on the whole Armour of God, Chriſt overcame him alſo, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14, 15. <hi>Through death he deſtroyed him who had the power of death, even the Devil.</hi> And the ſame Apoſtle in the ſame Epiſtle tells us, that he was therefore tempted, that <hi>he might be able to ſuccour thoſe that are tempted.</hi> The Apoſtle mentioneth Chriſt in this Notion, when he calleth him, <hi>The Captain of our Salvation.</hi> It is long ſince that he let his People know by his Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> that <hi>In all their affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions he was afflicted.</hi> He took himſelf concerned in the perſecution of his Church, and therefore calleth from Heaven, <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me.</hi> Indeed it is not eaſie to determine what kind of <hi>Sympathy</hi> the moſt perfect Nature of Chriſt is capable of, but that he is their <hi>Fellow-ſufferer,</hi> the Scripture plainly determineth. Thus you ſee, that it is not in a complement that Jeſus Chriſt ſpeaking to his Saints, ſpeaks to them in this dialect, <hi>Thou that art my Fellow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But our Tranſlation reads it, <hi>O my Love;</hi> and the word, as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhewed you, is alſo ſo tranſlated properly enough. A Friend hath this name in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> becauſe he is alwaies the companion and aſſociate of his correlated Friend. Hence we tranſlate it, <hi>My Loves,</hi> and conformably to this our Lord ſpeaketh, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 14. <hi>You are my Friends, if you do whatſoever I have commanded you.</hi> And again, <hi>v.</hi> 15. <hi>Henceforth I call you not Servants, I call you Friends.</hi> Let us a little inquire how Chriſt approveth himſelf a <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers Friend.</hi> Friendſhip ſpeaketh 4 things.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="691" facs="tcp:61084:350"/>
1. <hi>Love.</hi> 2. <hi>Free and ingenuous love.</hi> 3. <hi>Mutual,</hi> and <hi>reciprocal Love.</hi> 4. <hi>Mutual communion</hi> and <hi>converſe each with other.</hi> 1. <hi>It Speaketh Love. Amicus ab amando.</hi> This is ſo obvious to every one that either underſtandeth any thing of the <hi>Revelation</hi> or <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of <hi>holy, Writ,</hi> that it will need very few words to demonſtrate. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the frequent friendly compellations which Chriſt hath given his <hi>People,</hi> whoſo conſidereth his conjuction with his Father in the <hi>Eternal Purpoſes</hi> for their Salvation, and all thoſe means by which they are made meet for the inheritance of the Saints in light; his concern in the <hi>Eternal Covenant</hi> of <hi>Redemption</hi> and of <hi>Grace,</hi> in which he became a Surety for them; his taking upon him humane Nature, walking up and down in our fleſh, Dying upon the Croſs for us ſinners; his reſurrection from the dead for their juſtification; his aſcending up into Heaven, and giving Gifts unto men, Paſtors and Teachers for the perfecting of the Saints; his ſending his Spirit to convince the World of ſin, righteouſneſs and Judgment; his daily influence upon his People, ſtrengthening, quickening, and comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them; his being their advocate with the Father, in caſe both of Sins and duties; his paſſionate expreſſions while he was on the Earth for the converſion of Souls; his intreating them by his Miniſters, as his Embaſſadors, that they would be reconciled to God; the charge that he hath given the World againſt offending them; his declarations of his coming to judge the World, to render tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to them that trouble them, and to them Reſt and Peace: I ſay he that conſidereth any of theſe things, much leſs, all of them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, muſt ſay that <hi>he loved</hi> them with an <hi>Everlaſting, unchangeable Love;</hi> alone ſuted to all the neceſſities of his poor Creatures, and that he hath willed them good ſutable to all their Evils.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, Friendſhip ſpeaketh <hi>free and ingenuous Love.</hi> Not the Love of a <hi>Child</hi> to a <hi>Father</hi> which is Natural, &amp; to which he is obliged by a filial duty becauſe of his Fathers care of, and <hi>proviſion</hi> for him; not the Love of a <hi>Servant,</hi> which is purchaſed by a kind uſage, and dependance. A <hi>friend</hi> loveth freely. The Love of true Friends, is ordinarily an inaccountable thing. They love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and can hardly give one another an account of it, further than a goodneſs, and excellency, a ſuitableneſs, and likeneſs which they diſcern, or at leaſt think they ſee each in other. Chriſts Love to us is free. He <hi>healeth our backſlidings and loveth</hi> us <hi>freely. He hath mercy on whom he will have mercy.</hi> The reciprocal Love of the believing Soul is not ſo free and ſo ingenuous, as is his beloveds love to him.
<pb n="692" facs="tcp:61084:351"/>
Yet it is thus far ingenuous, that it is not only for that the Soul hath from Chriſt, but for that goodneſs, and excellency which it diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in Chriſt; this we had before, <hi>Becauſe of the Savour of thy good Ointments, therefore do the Virgins Love thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Love properly doth not make a friend unleſs it be <hi>mutual, and reciprocal.</hi> Indeed in a large ſenſe, a man may be ſaid to be a <hi>friend to his Enemy:</hi> That is, to wiſh well to him, and to do him ſome kind Offices. But this is not <hi>friendſhip.</hi> All <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> implyeth a <hi>reciprocation of Love.</hi> Chriſt <hi>Loves the believer,</hi> and every <hi>true</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever <hi>loveth Chriſt.</hi> So they are Friends, in the ſtricteſt, and moſt proper ſenſe. Indeed there is a great difference which is well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by one of the Caſuiſts thus: <q>We will good to him, but we<note place="margin">Tolet. in Caſ. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. <hi>4.</hi> c. <hi>8.</hi>
                     </note> do not beſtow that good upon him, which we will him: But he while he willeth good to us, alſo giveth us that good which he, willeth, and by his loving us maketh us good, and lovely.</q> But every Child of God truly loveth Chriſt; truly I ſay, that is, <hi>ſincerely</hi> though not with that kind or degree of Love with which Chriſt loveth him. <hi>Lord</hi> (ſaith <hi>Peter) thou that knoweſt all things, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt that I Love thee.</hi> And <hi>If any man Loves not the Lord Jeſus</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>let him be Anathema Maranatha.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Laſtly, <hi>Love of friendſhip alwaies ſpeaketh Communion betwixt the two Lovers.</hi> We are bound to Love our Enemies, and in every good man there is ſuch a Love, even to thoſe that hate them; but this is no Love of friendſhip, for the Precept of <hi>Love</hi> to <hi>Enemies,</hi> obligeth onely againſt <hi>malice and private Revenge,</hi> and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Offices of kindneſs, it doth not oblige to intimacy, or to any <hi>near fellowſhip,</hi> and <hi>Communion</hi> with them. We are ſo far obliged to Love our Enemies, as to bear no malice againſt them, to take no <hi>private Revenge</hi> upon them, to be ready to do any acts of kindneſs for their Souls, and any common offices of love. But I ſay we are not by it obliged to make them our intimates nor to keep any fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip or communion with them. But in a <hi>Love of friendſhip,</hi> there is alwaies Communion, or a mutual Communication of the Parties loving each to others. Chriſt gives this account of his love of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to his diſciples, <hi>John</hi> 15. 15. <hi>Henceforth I call you not Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, for the Servant knoweth not what his Lord doth, but I have called you Friends, for all things I have heard of my Father I have made known to you.</hi> Chriſt Communicates himſelf to <hi>believers,</hi> to ſuch as are his diſciples indeed, he is in them, they in him, and he is daily Communicating of his life, and ſtrength to them, for,
<pb n="693" facs="tcp:61084:351"/>
                  <hi>John</hi> 15. 4. <hi>Without him, they can do nothing.</hi> They are daily communicating themſelves unto him, making a ſecret ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to him, of <hi>their hearts,</hi> their <hi>wills,</hi> their affections. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating their <hi>wants</hi> and <hi>deſires</hi> to him by <hi>Prayer,</hi> &amp;c. Thus I have juſtified the notion of Chriſts <hi>Love,</hi> his <hi>friend,</hi> his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, to be agreeable, to what the Scripture revealeth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Chriſt, and the believing Soul.</p>

My Friend! My Fellow!</hi> Is it not he who is the Eternal Son of God, God over all bleſſed for ever, he to whom there is none like, and beſides whom there is no God? He whom God calleth his fellow, and who thought it no robbery to be equal with the Father. And to whom doth he ſpeak? Is it not to thoſe who muſt ſay to corruption, <hi>thou art my Mother,</hi> and to the Worms, <hi>you are my brethren and my Siſters?</hi> To thoſe whoſe Fathers are <hi>Amorites,</hi> and whoſe Mothers are <hi>Hittites,</hi> who by nature are dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, unclean Children of unclean Parents. Will the Lord Love ſuch <hi>Ethioptans,</hi> as we are by nature? Such Enemies, as we have ſhewed our ſelves by practice? Will the Lord make himſelf a companion to the creature, that is but as the duſt of his feet? What manner of Love and condeſcenſion is this? For him whom the Eternal Father hath proclaimed to be his Son, and that Son in whom he is well pleaſed in whom the Lord hath ſet up his reſt, he whom <hi>Kings and Prophets</hi> deſired to ſee, whom <hi>Angels</hi> and glorified Saints adore, to whom the Father hath given a name above every name, he who hath Heaven for his throne, the Earth for his footſtool, and the utmoſt ends of the Earth for his poſſeſſion to ſay to us, <hi>My Love, My Friend, My Companion?</hi> Certainly theſe terms ought to raviſh our hearts, and to affect them with in expreſſible admiration; and to whom doth he ſay thus? Is it only to the <hi>Glories</hi> and <hi>beauties</hi> of the World? To the <hi>Emperors, Rings, Princes</hi> and Nobles thereof? No; he ſaith thus to every believer, even the meaneſt that tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon the Earth, to the moſt poor, diſtreſſed, afflicted crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to <hi>Job</hi> that ſits upon a dunghill ſcraping himſelf with a potſheard, to <hi>Lazarus</hi> that lyeth at the rich mans gate full of ſores, and begging bread, while the Dogs lick his ſores, to the

pooreſt believer living in the meaneſt and dirtieſt Gottage, to thoſe whom the World revileth, ſlighteth, ſcorneth, to thoſe who have ſpit in his face, and abuſed his patience, and deſpiſed his goodneſs, that have hardened their hearts againſt him, griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his holy Spirit. Yet having repented of theſe things and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing turned to him, to theſe he calleth, to theſe he ſaith, <hi>My Love, My Friends, My Companions!</hi> He upbraideth them not for their former miſcarriages, to theſe he becometh a fellow Priſoner, in theſe he becomes a fellow helper, theſe ſhall be joint heirs with him. <hi>Hear O Heavens! be aſtoniſhed O Earth,</hi> never was Love like this, never ſuch matchleſs Love. Let all our Souls ſwallow up themſelves in this gulph of unfathomable Love, and while we are ſinking let us cry out, <hi>O the height, and depth, and length, and breadth</hi> of the Love <hi>of God in Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> It is a condeſcenſion beyond the graſp of our faith. The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it cauſeth in us a difficulty to believe it. Who is a God like our God, a <hi>Saviour</hi> a <hi>Redeemer,</hi> an <hi>Huſband</hi> like our Saviour, our Redeemer our Spiritual Husband? When they told <hi>David,</hi> that he ſhould have <hi>Michal</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Saul</hi> to Wife, and perſuaded him to it; Seemeth it to you (ſaith he) <hi>a ſmall thing to be a Son-in-law to a King?</hi> If there be any of you not affected with this Love, this tranſcendent Love, give me leave to ſpeak to you in the language of <hi>David;</hi> Seemeth it to you a ſmall thing, to be the beloved, the friends, the companions of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt? Ah! That I could ſend you away this day, admiring the divine Love, that he ſhould take the <hi>fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> of our nature upon him, that he ſhould make us his <hi>fellow Citizens,</hi> admit us to a fellowſhip with him both in grace here, and in glory hereafter, that he ſhould be our <hi>Companion</hi> in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation, our Companion <hi>in labour,</hi> and <hi>follow Soldier.</hi> But I leave this to be further improved by you in your more private meditations.</p>

Secondly, This notion is of wonderful uſe <hi>to relieve, and comfort the People of God under all their preſent afflictions or fears of greater.</hi> The face of things as to Gods People hath been a long time gathering blackneſs and there is this day a great blackneſs. Priſons in the Primitive times were more the habitations of Gods People then Palaces, God grant we may not ſee them to be ſo again; we have been ſo uſed to beds of Feathers &amp; Down, that the thoughts of a bed of ſtraw make us ſhrink, ſo wedded to our

His Companions in tribulation, and to call himſelf their fellow Souldier and <hi>fellow Priſoner.</hi> There are a great many arguments with which the ſuffering Servants of God may be relieved; <hi>Fear none of thoſe things which thou ſhalt ſuffer</hi> (ſaid the <hi>Angel to</hi> the <hi>Church at</hi> Smyrna) <hi>Behold the Devil ſhall caſt ſome of you into Priſon, that you may be tryed, and you ſhall have tribulation that you might be tryed, and you ſhall have tribulation for ten days, Rev.</hi> 2. 10. There are ſeveral ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, 1. <hi>It is the Devil that caſt Saints into Priſon.</hi> He doth it by men as his inſtruments, but he filleth them with their <hi>rage and malice,</hi> 2. <hi>It is that they may be tryed.</hi> God permits it, the Devil could have no power againſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a believer more then againſt Chriſt, if God did not permit it. The Devil and his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments deſign is to ruin and to deſtroy them, Gods end is to try them. 3. It ſhall be <hi>but a tribulation</hi> for <hi>ten days,</hi> a ſhort time. <hi>The rod of the wicked ſhall not always reſt upon the lot of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous.</hi> Well, but how ſhall they hold out theſe ten days? See <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> 43. 1, 2. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord that created thee, O</hi> Jacob, <hi>and he that formed thee, O</hi> Iſrael, <hi>Fear not, for I have Redeemed thee, I have called thee by thy name, thou art mine. When thou paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt through the waters I will be with thee, and through the rivers they ſhall not overflow thee. When thou walkeſt through the fires thou ſhalt not be burnt, neither ſhall the flame kindle upon thee.</hi> In the ten days of tribulation, the Child of God ſhall not be alone, he that Redeemed them, <hi>will be with them.</hi> This was made good to the three Children in the fiery fornace in <hi>Babylon,</hi> Dan. 3. 24. <hi>Did not we caſt three men bound into the midſt of the fire?</hi> (ſaith <hi>Nebuchadnezzar) lo I ſee four men looſe walking in the middeſt of the fire, and they have no hurt, and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.</hi> He was with <hi>Daniel, Daniel</hi> 9. 22.

                  <hi>as an Evil doer, or as a buſy body in other, mens matters. But if any man ſuffer as a Chriſtian, let him not be aſhamed, but let him glorify God one this behalf.</hi> Let men look that they <hi>ſuffer for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſake,</hi> that is, to avoid ſinning againſt God, (all ſuch ſuffering is for righteouſneſs ſake) then they ſhall never be alone. <hi>Saul, Saul why</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>perſecuteſt thou me,</hi> calling out of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to <hi>Paul,</hi> when he was in his full carreer of perſecution of the Church. No man can expect, that Chriſt ſhould be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion to him in his tribulation while he ſuffereth meetly for his <hi>ſtomach,</hi> or out of <hi>humour,</hi> much leſs if he ſuffereth for doing that which is plainly ſinful and which he ought not to have done, but if he ſuffereth to avoid ſin againſt God, to keep him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unſpotted from the World, as he is made a partaker of Chriſts ſufferings, ſo Chriſt will be a partaker of his ſufferings, his Companion in ſuffering, and whenſoever Chriſts glory ſhall be revealed, he ſhall be glad with exceeding joy. It is a marvelous ſweet notion to ſuffering Chriſtians, to hear that Jeſus Chriſt is, and will be their Companion in ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; fear not therefore Chriſtians! in deſpight of evil men, and evil times, to keep a good Conſcience, but <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>Count it all joy, when you fall into diverſe temptations.</hi> A good Conſcience was yet never in Priſon alone. Nor will this be ſtrange to us if we conſider, that even death it ſelf, though it makes Soul and Body part Company, yet it doth not make Chriſt and a believer part Company. Our Bodies ſhall be raiſed from the Grave, <hi>by the Spirit of Chriſt dwelling in us, Rom.</hi> 8. 11. There are two great arguments amongſt others to comfort the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God in all their <hi>noons of Afflictions,</hi> 1. That even then they are <hi>Chriſts fellows.</hi> They then are in the <hi>fellowſhip of his death,</hi> Phil. 4. 10, 11. They <hi>ſuffer with him,</hi> Rom. 8. 17. They are <hi>made conformable to his death,</hi> Chriſt is <hi>magnified in their body.</hi> They make up what is lacking in the <hi>ſufferings of Chriſt,</hi> 2. <hi>That Chriſt will then be their fellow;</hi> it is to the Spouſe at <hi>Noon,</hi> that he ſaith here, <hi>O My Love, My Fellow!</hi> &amp;c. When the World is ſpitting their Venom, ſhewing their utmoſt Malice and hatred, even then Chriſt is calling to them and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>My Love.</hi> When the World is caſting them out as <hi>Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent fellows,</hi> then is Chriſt ſaying unto them, <hi>My Companions!</hi> Then will he be with them, and manifeſt himſelf as a friendly Companion to them.</p>

In the third place, How <hi>ſhould this raiſe up the hearts of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans above all diſcouragements, as to hard and difficult duties.</hi> O ſaith a Chriſtian. This is an hard ſaying, who can hear it, a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult duty, how ſhall I ever perform it? how ſhall I ever get up my heart to it? Put to thy hand Chriſtian, thou canſt do nothing of thy ſelf, but thou mayeſt do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengtheneth thee, what cannot Chriſt and thou do toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? I live, ſaith <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 2. 20. <hi>yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me, and the life which I now live in the fleſh, I live by the faith of the Son of God.</hi> Remember Chriſt hath called thee <hi>fellow,</hi> and why? Becauſe he is thy <hi>fellow helper</hi> in <hi>duty</hi> as well as thy fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Priſoner, and fellow Souldier in all thy ſufferings.

                  <hi>Is Chriſt our</hi> Companion? let us not grudg then to be his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and let us behave our ſelves towards him as towards a Companion, and ſuch a Companion. <hi>This learneth us ſeveral things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. It learneth us what is <hi>our conſtant work and duty, viz!</hi> To <hi>Glorify God by doing the work which God hath given us to do, by</hi>
                  <pb n="698" facs="tcp:61084:354"/>
                  <hi>manifeſting his name to thoſe whom God hath given us.</hi> This was Chriſts work, he went up and down doing good, ſaith the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt. This was Chriſts work, this ſhould be our work, we ſhould be thinking every morning, how ſhould I glorify Chriſt this day? How may I ſhew my ſelf this day a <hi>Companion in labour</hi> to my great Lord and Maſter? this we cannot do by making our ſelves Companions of fools, nor meer Companions of worldly men, but by being the Companions of thoſe that fear the Lord.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It learneth us our duty, to be <hi>couragious,</hi> valiant in fight, ſtriving againſt ſin, <hi>confident of Victory</hi> over all our <hi>Spiritual Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</hi> Of theſe I have ſpake before. We ſhould alſo in conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of this uſe Chriſt as our <hi>Companion,</hi> and behave our ſelves towards him as to our Companion, and as to ſuch a Companion, as he is. I ſhall direct in that in two or three particulars, 1. <hi>Be no Companion to Chriſts Enemies.</hi> David ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 63. <hi>I am a Companion of all them that fear thee, Pſal.</hi> 119. 63. <hi>Solomon</hi> telleth us, That a <hi>Companion of fools ſhall be deſtroyed Prov.</hi> 13. 20. Who thoſe fools are you may read, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 9, 10. <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. 8. All ſuch as ſhall <hi>never enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God,</hi> ſuch as ſhall be deſtroyed in the lake that burns with fire, and brimſtone, are fools with a witneſs. No Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to theſe can ſhew himſelf a Companion to Jeſus Chriſt: <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 7. A <hi>Companion of riotous men ſhameth his Father.</hi> He that is a <hi>Companion,</hi> an ordinary Company, to looſe and profane men, <hi>Drunkards, Swearers, Blaſphemers, profane Swearers, and curſers,</hi> and profeſſeth to be a Companion of Chriſt ſhameth Chriſt to whom he pretendeth to be a Companion. <hi>Have no fellowſhip with the unfruitful works of darkneſs, Eph.</hi> 5. 11. If you have ſee what the ſame Apoſtle ſaith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 14. <hi>What fellowſhip can righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>light</hi> have with you? The Gentleman abhorreth his Miſtriſs that makes herſelf a Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to ever Tapſter and Porter. 2. <hi>Be you much in company with Chriſt. Fellows,</hi> and <hi>lovers</hi> uſe to be ſo, they are never well but when they are ſo. <hi>Frequent Communion with God,</hi> is like the frequent meetings, and converſes of lovers, which ripen things apace for the wedding day. The Soul that is much with Chriſt in <hi>Soliloquies</hi> and <hi>meditations,</hi> much in <hi>Prayer,</hi> ripeneth apace for glory, for the great <hi>marriage of the Lamb.</hi> Much commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God, hath theſe two eminent advantages. God is by
<pb n="699" facs="tcp:61084:354"/>
it much indeared to the Soul and the Soul is again reciprocally much endeared to God by it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>When thou art in communion with Chriſt be not Idle.</hi> A man may be in his ſtudy, and do nothing of moment; a Child may truant in the School: <hi>Domitian,</hi> may be killing flyes in his <hi>Councel-Chamber.</hi> A Soul may loſe that time that it pretends to ſpend with Chriſt. Spend this hallowed part of your time, as Lovers, and Companions uſe to do.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In <hi>imparting your ſecrets unto Chriſt:</hi> Your ſecret wants, doubts, fears, deſires, not concealing your moſt ſecret thoughts from the Lord.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> In wooing of your beloved: <hi>Begging his love and favour, crying out to him with the Spouſe,</hi> Let him kiſs me with the kiſſes of his mouth. Draw me, and we will run after thee. Tell me O thou whom my <hi>Soul</hi> loveth! where thou feedeſt, where thou mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thy flocks to reſt at Noon.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>In mutual embraces:</hi> The embraces of <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>love.</hi> I <hi>held him</hi> (ſaith the Spouſe) <hi>and would not let him go.</hi> Put the hand of faith about the neck of your beloved, it is a Chain from which he cannot, from which he will not get looſe. But I have dwelt long enough upon the compellation in the Text, <hi>[my Love</hi> or <hi>my Fellow]</hi> I ſhould now come to the matter of my text, <hi>I have compared thee to a company of Horſes in</hi> Phara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oh's <hi>Chariots.</hi> But of that hereafter.</p>

I ſhall ſpeak to this Propoſition in my uſual method, by way of <hi>Explication, Confirmation,</hi> and <hi>Application.</hi> By way of Explication I ſhall ſhew you, 1. <hi>In what ſenſe</hi> that term, <hi>I have likened,</hi> or I <hi>have compared thee,</hi> is to be underſtood. 2. <hi>Why Chriſt hath likened his Spouſe to Horſes,</hi> to a <hi>company of Horſes,</hi> and why to a <hi>company of Horſes in</hi> Pharaoh<hi>'s Chariots.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the firſt, the only queſtion is, Whether the ſenſe be, <hi>I have made thee like,</hi> or <hi>I have fancied thee like;</hi> the <hi>Radical</hi> word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> ſignifieth to <hi>be like,</hi> or to <hi>aſſimilate.</hi> I find it frequently in Scripture uſed in <hi>Pihel,</hi> the very Conjugation in which it is uſed in this Text. From ſome of thoſe Texts we may poſſibly gather the ſenſe of it in this Text, <hi>Numb.</hi> 15. 35. <hi>I will do unto them as I thought to do unto them.</hi> There it is tranſlated, <hi>I thought,</hi> Iſa. 14. 24. <hi>As I have thought, ſo have I brought it to paſs,</hi> Judg. 20. 5. <hi>The men of</hi> Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beah—<hi>thought to ſlay me,</hi> Pſal. 48. 9. <hi>We have thought of thy lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving kindneſs,</hi> Hoſ. 12. 10. <hi>I have uſed ſimilitudes,</hi> Lam. 2. 13. <hi>To what ſhall I liken thee?</hi> The word is in Scripture often uſed to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the making <hi>Idea's</hi> and <hi>Repreſentations</hi> of things in our minds. No man does any action but he firſt makes the <hi>Idea</hi> and Platform of it in his thoughts: Now this action of the mind informing the <hi>Idea</hi> or <hi>Platform</hi> of a thing, is that which is expreſſed by this word. In ſhort, the word may ſignifie either; <hi>I have made thee like,</hi> or <hi>I have in my mind fancied,</hi> or <hi>conceived thee like;</hi> ſo it either denotes a <hi>gracious act of Chriſt</hi> terminated in us, or an action of Chriſt <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated in himſelf.</hi> In the firſt ſenſe it ſignifies, Chriſt's induing of his Spouſe with ſome noble and generous qualities, bearing ſome proportion to thoſe that are found in an Horſe. In the ſecond ſenſe it is rather expreſſive of ſome duty in the Spouſe proceeding from ſuch Endowments. In the Text the latter muſt include the former. For he who draweth the <hi>ſimilitude,</hi> is one who cannot err in his Judgment. We may have Fancies that are vain, and our minds may conceive of things otherwiſe than indeed they are. He cannot conceive his Spouſe like to a company of Horſes, if indeed ſhe were not ſo, He could not be deceived with a falſe Repreſentation of any Object. I think it no vain conjecture of ſome Interpreters of this Text, that our Saviour addeth theſe words, with ſome reference to the Spouſe's Petition immediately preceding. She had begg'd to to be directed how in the Noon of her afflicted ſtate, when the Sun of Tryals and Perſecutions beated hot on her, ſhe might enjoy, a free, full Communion with him, he had bidden her to <hi>go forth by</hi>
                  <pb n="701" facs="tcp:61084:355"/>
                  <hi>the footſteps of the Flock,</hi> to follow the ſteps of thoſe who before had walked with God under the darker diſpenſations of his Providence. Now, leſt ſhe ſhould ſhrink at the thoughts of Trials, he goes on, and tells her, he had made her like, and looked upon her as like to an <hi>Horſe,</hi> yea a <hi>company of Horſes in</hi> Pharaoh<hi>'s Chariots.</hi> But,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Why doth our Saviour compare his Spouſe to Horſes?</hi> We would in our Age think it a ſtrange Complement for a man to uſe to the woman whom he loved. But we muſt remember, that a great deal is to be allowed in the different Dialect of ſeveral Nations, in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Ages, as we ſee is to Perſons in the ſame Age living at an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years diſtance each from other. There are many Phraſes which an hundred or two years ago were good Engliſh, and good ſenſe, which in our more Polite and Reformed Age we ſhould now judge very ordinary courſe Language. <hi>Elijah</hi> you know was called by the King of <hi>Iſrael, The Chariots of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and the Horſemen thereof;</hi> all that was meant, was the <hi>honour,</hi> and <hi>ſtrength,</hi> and <hi>defence</hi> of the Nation. So <hi>Zech.</hi> 10. 3. It is ſaid, God had viſited his Flock, and made them like a goodly Horſe in Battel. And <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 11, 14. Chriſt is deſcribed as <hi>riding upon a white Horſe,</hi> and <hi>his Army on white Horſes.</hi> The Spouſe is here compared to <hi>Horſes,</hi> a company of Horſes, only for ſome eminent quality, or qualities in Horſes. Nor is our own Dialect free from ſuch compariſons. We ſay of a man without diſparagement, <hi>He is as ſtrong as an Horſe.</hi> Nor is this ſimilitude improper, whether we conſider, 1. <hi>The generous quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of that creature:</hi> Or, 2. <hi>The general repute and value which ſome of that Species have,</hi> eſpecially with ſome Perſons. The <hi>Hebrew Doctors</hi> reckon up ſeven Qualities of an Horſe, but they reckon good and bad Qualities together. 1. It is a <hi>goodly creature.</hi> 2. It is a <hi>docible creature,</hi> eaſily to be taught ſeveral things. 3. It is a <hi>mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi> valiant creature. 4. It is a <hi>ſwift creature.</hi> 5. It is a very <hi>labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious uſeful creature.</hi> I do not think that all theſe are intended in this Text, becauſe it is not ſaid, I have likened thee to an <hi>Horſe,</hi> but <hi>to a company of Horſes in</hi> Pharaoh<hi>'s Chariots.</hi> There are two or three of them which may be intended, and it is queſtionable which of them is principally intended.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>An Horſe is a goodly creature.</hi> You read of a <hi>goodly Horſe, Zech.</hi> 10. 3. We take a great delight to look upon ſome Horſes whoſe Limbs are well proportioned, and which have been well man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged. An Horſe is very comely above a Swine, or an Ox, or any neat Cattel: And uſually Horſes uſed in Coaches and Chariots,
<pb n="702" facs="tcp:61084:356"/>
(eſpecially Princes Chariots) are of the moſt goodly and comely ſort. If we ſhould take it in this ſenſe, it ſignifies Chriſt's high Opinion of his Church, and every Believing Soul. He had before called her, <hi>The faireſt amongſt Women,</hi> here he compareth her to <hi>goodly Horſes.</hi> This is <hi>Beza</hi>'s, and ſome other Learned Interpreters Notion of the <hi>Metaphor</hi> in the Text. The <hi>ſtature</hi> and talneſs of the Woman, and juſt proportion of her Limbs one to another (ſaith he) addeth much unto her beauty. Horſes (upon thoſe accounts) are very lovely, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful creatures; but beſides that, I have diſcourſed before the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and comelineſs of the Spouſe, I muſt confeſs I incline with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other Interpreters rather to another ſenſe of it in this Text.</p>
               <p n="2">2. An Horſe is a very <hi>ſwift creature.</hi> There are indeed other creatures in other Countries that are more ſwift of foot than an Horſe, but none of ordinary uſe that are ſwifter of foot. <hi>Deodate</hi> thus interprets the <hi>Metaphor,</hi> and there is a truth in it. God puts into his People a Spirit of life and activity, ſo as they are <hi>ſwift to hear,</hi> James 1. 19. <hi>ready to every good work.</hi> We read in Scripture of Horſes <hi>ſwifter than Leopards, Hab.</hi> 1. 8. But I do not think this principally intended in this place, and it ſeemeth too much a ſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Metaphor.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And laſtly, Therefore the Horſe is a <hi>ſtrong and valiant crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> God himſelf propoundeth the Horſe as a pattern of ſtrength, <hi>Job</hi> 32. 19. <hi>Haſt thou given unto the Horſe his ſtrength?</hi> And it is ſaid of God, that <hi>he delighteth not in the ſtrength of an Horſe, Pſal.</hi> 147. 10. And as the Horſe is a creature of ſtrength, ſo it is a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a great ſpirit and courage; <hi>He ruſheth into the Battel, and is not afraid, Jer.</hi> 8. 6. God ſpeaking to <hi>Job</hi> concerning the Horſe, giveth an excellent and elegant deſcription of him, <hi>Job</hi> 39. 19, 20. where God asketh <hi>Job, Haſt thou clothed his neck with Thunder? Canſt thou make him afraid at a Graſhopper? The glory of his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils is terrible. He paweth in the Valley, and rejoyceth in his ſtrength. He goeth on to meet the armed man, he mocketh at fear, and is not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted, neither turneth he back from the Sword. The Quiverrattleth againſt him, the glittering Spear, and the Shield, he ſwalloweth the ground with fierceneſs and rage, neither believeth he that it is the ſound of the Trumpet. He ſaith amongſt the Trumpets, Ha, Ha, and he ſmelleth the Battel afar off, the Thunder of the Captains, and the ſhout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</hi> With reſpect of this Quality of the Horſe I conceive it is, that the <hi>Spouſe</hi> is here compared to <hi>Horſes;</hi> War-like Horſes, full of ſpirit and courage. I <hi>have likened thee to a company of Horſes;</hi> That

is, I have made thee <hi>bold, couragious, full of reſolution,</hi> to make a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual reſiſtance to thy Enemies, to bid a defiance to them, no more to regard the <hi>reproaches</hi> and revilings, the threats, and rage, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences of wicked men that oppoſe thee, and cauſe thy trouble, than the Horſe regardeth the <hi>ratlings of the Quiver,</hi> or the <hi>ſound of the Trumpet,</hi> or the <hi>glittering Spear</hi> or Shield. Fear not the rage and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thy Enemies. I have made thee like to the Horſes in <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh's</hi> Chariots, which are ſo bred, and ſo ſpirited, that they mock at fear; and the more their Enemies rage and make a noiſe, the more couragiouſly, and with the more mettle they go on. This I take to be the moſt proper and likely ſenſe of the <hi>Metaphor</hi> in this Text; accordingly I ſhall handle it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But it is not ſaid, <hi>To an Horſe</hi> only, but to a <hi>company of Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes:</hi> Why to a company of Horſes? The term company denotes <hi>Multitude</hi> and <hi>Unity.</hi> 1. It denotes <hi>Multitude.</hi> The Church of Chriſt conſiſts of many <hi>Individual Believers,</hi> who in reſpect of their Innocency, and feeding in the ſame Paſtures, are compared ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to a Flock of Sheep here in reſpect of that ſpirit of <hi>valour, courage,</hi> and <hi>fortitude</hi> which animates them all, to a <hi>company of Horſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It is a term which denotes <hi>Unity,</hi> not a numerical Unity, but an Unity in ſome <hi>common work,</hi> and in ſome accidents common to them all. Thus the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>We being many are one body.</hi> There is, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 4, 5. <hi>one Body, one Spirit,</hi> they are <hi>called in one Hope, of their Calling,</hi> they have <hi>one Lord, one Faith, one Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,</hi> they have <hi>one God</hi> and <hi>Father of all.</hi> The Spouſe is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a <hi>company of Horſes in a field,</hi> or in the ſtreets, but to a <hi>company of Horſes in a Chariot,</hi> where they <hi>draw together,</hi> run toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon the Enemy. Every Believer alſo hath a <hi>Company</hi> within himſelf, the ſeveral <hi>powers</hi> and <hi>faculties</hi> of his Soul armed with the whole Armour of God. Theſe are like a <hi>company of Horſes in</hi> Pharaoh<hi>'s Chariots.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. But why in <hi>Pharaoh's Chariots. Pharaoh</hi> was a common name to the <hi>Kings of Egypt,</hi> and a <hi>company of Horſes in</hi> Pharaoh<hi>'s Chariots,</hi> ſignifieth no more than a company of the beſt <hi>Egyptian Horſes-Egypt</hi> at that time was one of the moſt famous places for <hi>Horſes</hi> in the world. Hence you read that <hi>Solomon</hi> had Horſes brought out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 10. 28. And the King of <hi>Judah ſent his Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors into</hi> Egypt, <hi>that they might give him Horſes, Ezek.</hi> 17. 15. So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 31. 1. <hi>Woe to them that go down to</hi> Egypt <hi>for help, and ſtay on</hi>
                  <pb n="704" facs="tcp:61084:357"/>
                  <hi>Horſes.</hi> v. 3. <hi>Their Horſes are fleſh, and not ſpirit.</hi> So as I think they have but a feeble ſupport from this Text, who would make advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of this Text to juſtify their notion, that this Divine por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of holy Writ is no more but a <hi>Love-ſong</hi> betwixt <hi>Solomon</hi> and <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Daughter.</p>
               <p>To all this I might add one thing more, that the <hi>Horſe</hi> by reaſon of thoſe excellent qualities, which the God of nature hath endued it with, hath in all ages been <hi>in a very high eſteem with men.</hi> The vanity of ſome Perſons in the expreſſion of this hath been very great. Hiſtorians tell us, the <hi>Perſians</hi> made ſolemn funerals for their Horſes; in other places they builded <hi>Pyramids</hi> over their Sepulchers. <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, built a City to the memory of his Horſe. <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> ſet up his Horſe a marble <hi>effigies.</hi> The Emperour <hi>Commodus,</hi> would have his Horſe buried in the <hi>Vatican.</hi> Our age is more rational, then to allow theſe vanities, but yet it is vain enough, many a man takes more care for the mangery of his Horſe then for the <hi>Education</hi> of his Child, and alloweth his Horſes more attendance then his wife. Which lets us ſee what a value men yet put upon this creature. So as this ſenſe may be put upon the Words of this Text, <hi>thou art as dear to me, and in as high eſteem with me, as the Horſes in</hi> Pharaohs <hi>Chariots are to, and with him.</hi> The Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition then of the Text amounteth to this:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> That the Church of Chriſt, and every particular believer in it, is in Chriſts Eyes exceeding lovely, and highly eſteemed of by him, and knowing that ſhe is in the midſt of Enemies he hath cloathed her with ſtrength for the victory ſufficient if ſhe will make uſe of it; <hi>he hath made her like to a</hi> Company of Horſes in <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Charrots.</p>
               <p>The proof of the Propoſition then lyeth in the proof of theſe two things.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> That the Spouſe of Chriſt is in his Eyes exceeding goodly, and beautiful, and highly eſteemed of by him.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> That ſhe is cloathed with ſufficient ſtrength and might to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come her Enemies.</p>
               <p>For the proof of the former, I ſhall not inſiſt upon it, for beſides the large diſcourſe I have already ſpent upon that, when I handled that phraſe <hi>(O thou faireſt amongſt women)</hi> The expreſſions of Scripture are ſo obvious to every Eye, where Chriſt ſetteth out his Love to, and eſteem of his Church, and
<pb n="705" facs="tcp:61084:357"/>
every particular believer, that I need not ſpend time in giving you an account of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The latter is no leſs plain, Immediately upon the fall God gave out this promiſe,</hi> Gen. <hi>3. 15.</hi> The ſeed of the woman ſhall break thine head, <hi>and</hi> thou ſhalt bruiſe his heel. <hi>The ſeed of the woman was Chriſt, and his ſeed, thoſe that believe in him. Conformable to this is that promiſe,</hi> Rom. <hi>16. 20.</hi> God ſhall bruiſe Sathan under your feet ſhortly. <hi>It was an ancient promiſe made to</hi> Abraham, <hi>and in him to all that walk in the</hi> ſteps of his faith, Thy ſeed ſhall poſſeſs the gates of its Enemies. <hi>God ſaith,</hi> Zech. <hi>10. 3.</hi> That he made his flock as a goodly Horſe in the day of battel, <hi>v. 5.</hi> And they ſhall be as mighty men which tread down the Enemies as mire in the ſtreets; in the battel they ſhall fight, becauſe the Lord is with them. <hi>I come to the</hi> Application.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Uſe 1.</note> I ſhall only apply it by <hi>Exhortation</hi> to two great duties: <hi>Fortitude</hi> and <hi>unity.</hi> I begin with the firſt, upon which I ſhall moſt inlarge, as to which I ſhall ſhew you, 1. <hi>Wherein it lies,</hi> and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe it to you as it ſtands diſtinguiſhed from a <hi>natural Spirit,</hi> and <hi>ſtomack.</hi> 2. <hi>From a moral fortitude.</hi> 2. I ſhall offer you ſome directions in order to the promoving of it. 3. <hi>Laſtly I</hi> ſhall preſs it by ſome arguments.</p>
               <p>It is agreed on all hands that the object of it is <hi>dangers</hi> and <hi>ſufferings.</hi> That the nature of it lyeth in a bold encountring, and going through them: That the vices oppoſed to it are. 1 <hi>Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardiſe.</hi> 2. <hi>Raſhneſs,</hi> or fool hardineſs, as we call it. There is a <hi>courage</hi> or <hi>fortitude</hi> which ariſeth only from the <hi>natural Spirit</hi> and courage of the creature. Now this is to be found in beaſts as much as in men, yea and more then in men, the reflections of whoſe reaſon makes them leſs Spiritful then <hi>Horſes,</hi> or <hi>Dogs,</hi> or <hi>Lions,</hi> &amp;c. This commendeth no man, for no man hath more of this then many Beaſts have. So it removeth not man at any diſtance from a Brute Creature. Secondly. There is a <hi>moral fortitude.</hi> Which though it muſt have ſome foundation in nature, for none that is naturally fearful, and cowardly, will by reaſon be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved to any degree of valour, yet differeth from the other. As it ariſeth from knowledge, and ſome juſt improvement of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and is governed by the dictates of reaſon, and directed to ſome noble, and rational end, ſuch now as the preſervation of our honour or Country, &amp;c. But now Chriſtian fortitude is quite another thing as it ariſeth,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="706" facs="tcp:61084:358"/>
1. From a threefold principle of grace, 2. As it is direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the rule of the Word. 3. As it is exerciſed upon and againſt ſin; As laſtly it works for a more noble end, the glory of God, and the Salvation of the Soul, you may take this Deſcription of it:</p>
               <p>It is an habit infuſed into the Soul by the holy Spirit of God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling the Soul, from the dread of the Eternal God, a Love to him, and a faith in him, and his promiſes, to deſpiſe the proſpect, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of any danger, in a reſiſtance and fighting againſt ſin, and all temptations to it, governing it ſelf by the rule of Gods Word, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the glory of God, and the Salvation of a mans Soul. <hi>From hence may eaſily be gathered, both how it differeth from</hi> Natural Spirit <hi>and</hi> ſtomackfulneſs <hi>which is under no govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, either of reaſon or Religion, and is a mere natural quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and found in beaſts, as much, and more then in man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It alſo differeth from <hi>Moral ſortitude,</hi> both in the <hi>Principle,</hi> the rule, and manner of its exerciſe, and the End. All which I ſhall open. I ſhall begin with the firſt of theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt Principle of <hi>Chriſtian Fortitude</hi> is the <hi>holy Spirit. Fear not</hi> ſaith God, I <hi>will ſtrengthen thee, and uphold thee with the hand of my righteouſneſs.</hi> It is indeed God as the God of Nature that puts the natural Spirit and courage into the Horſe, or other beaſts, <hi>Job.</hi> 32. 19. <hi>Haſt thou</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>given ſtrength to the Horſe; Haſt thou clothed his neck with Thunder?</hi> But here God acts as the Author of ſaving grace. The holy Spirit is the Author of all gracious habits, now there is a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold <hi>Spiritual habit,</hi> from which this <hi>fortitude</hi> or Chriſtian courage proceeds; they are as it were the Parents of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt is the <hi>fear of God.</hi> No man is valiant againſt ſin, when temptations to it lye from great dangers, but he that hath a true dread of God in, and upon his heart. It is ſaid of <hi>Moſes, Hebr.</hi> 11. 27. <hi>That by faith he forſook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the King, for he indured, as ſeeing him who is inviſible.</hi> He for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook Egypt in obedience to the command of God, he feared not the wrath of the King. When he ſaw he muſt either incur the Kings wrath, or Gods diſpleaſure, he feared not the wrath of the King, though (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith) <hi>The wrath of the King is as the Meſſenger of death:</hi> Yet he feared not the wrath of the King, here now was courage; here was Chriſtian Fortitude: Whence was it that he was ſo courageous? The Text tells
<pb n="707" facs="tcp:61084:358"/>
you, <hi>He indured, as ſeeing him who was inviſible,</hi> he had the dread of the King of Kings upon his Soul, <hi>agnovit imperatorem coeli,</hi> he knew there was one, that <hi>was higher then the higheſt</hi> mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal; and this is neceſſary, and that too in a very good degree to every Soul that is valiant for God. Every Perſon that feareth not God will be a coward in the Spiritual fight.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A Second habit contributing to this <hi>fortitude</hi> or <hi>Chriſtian courage,</hi> is <hi>The Love of God.</hi> The Apoſtle tells you it <hi>conſtrains;</hi> we ſee in daily experience, the lover will indure no difhonour to be done unto, no affront to be put upon the woman that he loveth. The vain Gentleman is ready to fight upon any ſuch account. The Soul which truly loveth God, will fuffer no affront, no diſhonour which he can help, to be done unto, and put upon God, much leſs can he allow his own Soul in any ſuch thing, what ever be the conſequent of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third habit from which this <hi>Chriſtian courage</hi> or <hi>forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> ariſeth is <hi>Faith: Faith</hi> reſpecting both the <hi>Propoſition of the Word,</hi> and the <hi>promiſe of the Goſpel,</hi> and <hi>Perſon of the Mediatour.</hi> Faith agreeing to all which the holy Scripture revealeth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>wrath of God,</hi> his power, juſtice greatneſs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the reward of thoſe who well fight the good fight, who overcome, &amp;c. And alſo hoping, and truſting in God for the <hi>fulfilling</hi> of thoſe promiſes. <hi>Natural courage</hi> is much from Nature, and derives much from the <hi>Blood, Moral Fortitude</hi> deriveth much from <hi>Education</hi> and <hi>Reaſon.</hi> Chriſtian Fortitude in encountring dangers ariſeth from quite different principles. The Chriſtian is <hi>ſtout</hi> and <hi>valiant</hi> in the <hi>reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of ſin,</hi> becauſe he <hi>feareth</hi> the <hi>great</hi> and <hi>living God,</hi> whoſe <hi>wrath</hi> is a thouſand times more formidable then the wrath of the greateſt man, who when he hath <hi>killed the body can do no more;</hi> God can <hi>caſt both body</hi> and <hi>Soul into Hell-Fire.</hi> Becauſe he <hi>loveth God,</hi> and will ſuffer any thing, rather than grieve and offend him, and becauſe he <hi>believeth,</hi> whatſoever God hath revealed in his holy Word concerning the greatneſs, power, wrath, and juſtice of God againſt ſin, and concerning thoſe who ſtrive in the reſiſtance of it. Hence you read in that <hi>martyrology</hi> which you have <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 33. That they <hi>through faith ſubdued Kingdoms,—v.</hi> 34. <hi>quenched the violence of fire, eſcaped the edge of the ſword,</hi>—waxed valiant in the fight, v. 35. they were <hi>tortured,</hi> not <hi>accepting deliverance, v.</hi> 36. <hi>they had Trials of cruel mockings,</hi>
                  <pb n="708" facs="tcp:61084:359"/>
                  <hi>and Scourgings, yea moreover of bonds, and impriſonment,</hi> &amp;c. The principles of the Chriſtian valour, are not meer <hi>Natural Spirit</hi> and <hi>ſtomackfulneſs,</hi> nor meer principles of <hi>honour,</hi> and <hi>reputation,</hi> and <hi>reaſon,</hi> which were the principles of the <hi>Roman</hi> valour, but theſe which I have ſhewed you.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As to the <hi>Acts of it.</hi> They are all <hi>lawful reſiſtances of ſin.</hi> He will reſiſt <hi>unto blood,</hi> but it ſtill is in <hi>ſtriving againſt ſin, Heb.</hi> 1. 2. 4. And this he doth by a <hi>lawful reſiſtance;</hi> This in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription I called a <hi>governing himſelf according to the rules of Gods Word,</hi> 2 Tim. 2 5. <hi>If a man ſtrive for maſteries, yet is he not crowned except he ſtrive lawfully.</hi> All <hi>ſin is a tranſgreſſion of the law of God.</hi> No <hi>Chriſtian fortitude</hi> can be ſhewen either in the encountring of a danger, for <hi>not doing what he ought to do:</hi> Or for the encountring of a danger, rather then doing, what God hath given him a <hi>freedom</hi> and <hi>liberty to do.</hi> As to the firſt a man is not Gods Martyr but the Devils: As to the Second, he cannot be a Martyr for God but for his own humour, God hath left him a liberty, he need not ſuffer unleſs he will. But now there may be ſeveral actions as to which a good man doth not ſee his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, but lyeth under apprehenſions, that they are unlawful. The Queſtion is <hi>what a Chriſtian is to do as to them?</hi> And <hi>whether a Chriſtian can ſhew any Chriſtian fortitude in incountring dangers rather then doing them.</hi> To which I ſhortly anſwer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That it is the duty of every good man as to ſuch actions to uſe all the means he can, as to a true information of his own conſcience.</hi> Reading the holy Scriptures, and other good Books, interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Scriptures, which may rightly inform him: Keeping his ear open to all arguments on both ſides, to all inſtructions.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>If by no means he can receive Satisfaction as to the lawfulneſs of ſuch actions, the doing of them would be ſin to him, and he is bound to incounter any danger rather then do them and this is a piece of Chriſtian fortitude.</hi> The proximate Rule of our actions muſt be our own Conſcience (by which I mean, our own pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical judgment of the lawfulneſs or unlawfulneſs of things to be done, according to the beſt information we have, or can get concerning the will of God in his word;) the perſuaſions, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, dictates, or practice of others is no rule to us. We muſt reſiſt what our own Conſciences tell us is ſin and contrary to the will of God.</p>
               <p>But it muſt be <hi>lawfully.</hi> It muſt be ſuch a <hi>reſiſtance</hi> only as
<pb n="709" facs="tcp:61084:359"/>
Gods Word doth allow us. A private Perſon in the reſiſtance of ſin, muſt not <hi>reſiſt the power, which is the Ordinance of God, Rom.</hi> 13. 2. It is one thing to do what ſuch powers command, another thing by Arms to reſiſt. God hath not given the Sword into any private hand, and ſuch a Perſon drawing it ſhall periſh with it; we muſt <hi>ſtrive againſt ſin,</hi> but we muſt <hi>ſtrive lawfully,</hi> not by ill Language, or boiſterous actions, but by meek and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Suffering.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Laſtly. The End of <hi>Chriſtian fortitude</hi> muſt be, 1. <hi>The glory of God.</hi> 2. <hi>The Salvation of our own Souls.</hi> 'Tis no Chriſtian valour, to be valiant for any thing but the truth, the honour and glory of God, the cauſe and concern of God in the World: and in a matter where the Eternal Salvation of his own Soul is concerned. Thus far I have opened to you the nature of this <hi>Chriſtian courage</hi> and <hi>fortitude,</hi> which I am calling to you for. Let me in the next place offer ſomething to you which may promove this excellent habit in your Souls. A <hi>Natural courage</hi> cannot be given, where any thing of a <hi>Moral fortitude</hi> may be promoved by rational arguments, education, and a due di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion of moral Principles. But there muſt be ſome good natural foundation of courage, for the <hi>Moraliſt</hi> in the managery of his diſciple to build upon, but it is not ſo as to this <hi>Chriſtian fortitude.</hi> Perſons of the weakeſt ſex, of the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, meaneſt, weakeſt Spirits by nature, have been made valiant as to the Spiritual fight from the <hi>dread of God,</hi> the <hi>Love of God,</hi> by <hi>ſaith</hi> in the Word of God, and in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Now in order to this excellent habit, and ſo neceſſary for theſe times,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt thing which I ſhall commend unto you in order to it is, a <hi>Sound knowledge of the revealed will of God, both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſin, and concerning duty.</hi> Knowledge is the <hi>foundation of ſaith.</hi> It is that which giveth boldneſs to a man both in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and in acting. A poor ignorant Perſon may be valiant, but he cannot expect to be ſo, he is Sometimes made valiant in an extraordinary manner, by ſome ſpecial inſtinct, and impreſſion of God upon him, as that Woman which told her Judges, <hi>She could not diſpute, but ſhe could dye for Chriſt.</hi> A juſt knowledge of what I may, or may not do, of the Nature of God, his promiſes, and threatnings, is moſt neceſſary to a true Chriſtian courage and fortitude. He fighteth more like a <hi>madman,</hi> then a <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> that is not firſt fully Satisfyed in the goodneſs, and juſtice of his cauſe.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="710" facs="tcp:61084:360"/>
2. <hi>A knowing man may be</hi> cowardly if he be not rooted and grounded in the faith, heartily and firmly believing what he hath the notion of. Faith <hi>is the only</hi> ſhield that keepeth off the fiery darts of the wicked. <hi>Now this is the gift of God, and the way to obtain it is</hi> Prayer. <hi>Beg of God his Spiritual armour, and to make you valiant in the Spiritual fight, Math. 26. 41.</hi> Watch and pray that you enter not into temptation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Set as looſe to the World and all your concerns, and Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in it as you can.</hi> It is obſerved of great Cities that they ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom hold out long againſt an Enemy, Their <hi>Riches,</hi> their <hi>Wives and Children</hi> make them Cowards. That Man or Woman that hath not learned to deny himſelf in all his worldly contentments can never be valiant.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Laſtly <hi>look unto Jeſus the Author, and the finiſher of your ſaith, who for the joy that was ſet before him, indured the croſs, deſpiſed the ſhame, and is ſet down on the throne of God; conſider him who indured ſuch contradiction of ſinners in himſelf, leſt you be weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſaint in your minds.</hi> It is the Apoſtles advice, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 3. The valour and courage of a General oft times puts mettal, and courage into his Souldiers, &amp; retrieveth a day of battel when it is upon the point loſt. The eying of Chriſt who is the author and finiſher of our faith, is of mighty uſe to us to ingage us to go on to the Spiritual fight without fear or dread. Let me preſs this upon you by a few arguments.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt ſhall be from <hi>the ton general decay of this gracious habit in the Spirits of Chriſtians.</hi> God of 'old complained by his Prophet, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9. 3. That there was a <hi>generation of them who bent their tongues like bows for lies,</hi> but there <hi>w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> none valiant for the truth upon the Earth.</hi> How few are there this day that are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant for the truth? There are many that bend their bows for lies. <hi>Papiſts</hi> are full of courage and mettal for an idolatrous wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; wicked men are full of malice &amp; courage to accuſe, inform againſt, and to deſtroy the People of God, but who is on the Lords ſide? Who? Where is the courage of Chriſtians for the truths, the waies, the Ordinances of God? They dare not appear for God, but ſeek all waies to hide, and cover themſelves, and to withdraw themſelves from the Lords battels. They are not like the warlike horſe God ſpeaketh of to <hi>Job,</hi> that <hi>ſaith amongſt the Trumpets, Ha, Ha,</hi> that mocketh at fear, is not affrighted, and turneth not his back from the Sword. It is time for ſome to

Let this a little move us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider <hi>how neceſſary a grace it is for the times in which we live.</hi> The whole Life of a Chriſtian upon the Earth is ſuch a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, ſuch a warring with Principalities and Powers, and the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the Darkneſs of this World, againſt ſpiritual wickedneſs in high places, that he had need be called to, at all times, to put on the <hi>whole Armour of God,</hi> that he may be able to ſtand againſt the Wiles of the Devil, to <hi>withſtand,</hi> and <hi>when he hath done all to ſtand.</hi> But the times wherein we live ſeem to have a particular malignity againſt Religion and Godlineſs above the times we have ſeen, or the daies of our Forefathers. The Devil is come down with a <hi>great rage,</hi> we had need of <hi>courage,</hi> and of <hi>patience.</hi> The <hi>Caſuiſts</hi> trouble their Readers with many Queſtions in order to the Solution of this one Queſtion, <hi>When a Chriſtian is obliged to make an explicit Confeſſion of his Faith,</hi> and to declare what he is, and what he will ſtand to, and abide by? They agree generally, that he is bound to do it <hi>where the glory of God is eminently concerned.</hi> 2. Or <hi>where the good of others is in eminent hazard.</hi> There are certainly two times when the <hi>glory of God is eminently concerned</hi> in Chriſtians appearing for him. 1. <hi>When his Truths and Ordinances are like to be trodden under foot.</hi> 2. <hi>When the Name and Things of God are eminently blaſphemed.</hi> I beſeech you conſider whether theſe be not times of great reproach and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy; were ever the Truths of God more oppoſed? was ever the holy Name of God to that degree blaſphemed? was there ever a greater rage againſt Religion and Godlineſs? Is it not now time for Chriſtians to buckle on their Armour, to quit themſelves like men, to arm themſelves with courage, to ſhew themſelves like a company of Horſes in <hi>Pharaoh's Chariots,</hi> Horſes that will not be afraid, like <hi>Graſhoppers,</hi> Horſes that <hi>paw in the Valley,</hi> and rejoyce in their ſtrength, and <hi>go on to meet the armed men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſider, That <hi>Chriſt hath made you like the Horſes in</hi> Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh<hi>'s Chariots.</hi> I will open this in two things.</p>

1. <hi>He hath put of his ſtrength into you.</hi> The wiſe man ſaith, <hi>The Horſe is prepared for the day of Battel;</hi> he is prepared by Nature, by a great natural Spirit which God hath given him, and he is prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by Art and Managery. God hath prepared every Chriſtian for this Spiritual battel by giving him a <hi>New Nature.</hi> We uſe to ſay, That if the Horſe knew its own ſtrength, it would be too hard for the Rider. God in mercy to man hath hidden the Horſes ſtrength from him. God in judgment hath hidden Chriſtians ſtrength from them, in theſe ſinful times. The Church hath a ſtrength in it, ſuch a ſtrength, as the Gates of Hell cannot prevail againſt. Believers have a ſtrength in, and with them, if they would but put it forth; pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, torments, fires, in former times could not prevail againſt them. How hath God in theſe ſinful times hidden the wiſdom of the wiſe, and the prudence of the prudent, and the ſtrength of the ſtrong men from them? What a ſtrength was there in <hi>Luther</hi> when <hi>Melancthon</hi> was afraid they ſhould periſh in their appearing for the Cauſe of God, and he made anſwer, <hi>Eſto, ruamus, ruet Chriſtus una Chriſtus magnus ille regnator mundi; mallem cum Chriſto ruere, quam cum Caeſare ſtare.</hi> Be it ſo (ſaith he) Let us periſh, Chriſt muſt periſh with us, Chriſt, that great <hi>Ruler</hi> of the World; I had rather fall with Chriſt, than ſtand with <hi>Caeſar.</hi> The Horſe is not afraid of an <hi>Army</hi> of armed men; he <hi>goeth on to meet the armed men, he mocketh at fear, he is not affrighted, he turneth not his back from the Sword, he feareth not the rattling of the Quiver,</hi> nor the <hi>glittering of the Spear, and the Shield, he ſwalloweth up the ground with fierceneſs and rage,</hi> neither believeth he <hi>that it is the ſound of the Trumpet.</hi> Chriſt hath made his People like to theſe Horſes, only the ſtrength of the Horſe is natural, the Believers ſtrength is ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual. Why are we afraid? 2. <hi>The Horſes in</hi> Pharaoh's <hi>Chariots had doubtleſs ſome Armour to protect them and preſerve them.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he that governed the Chariot took a care of them. Thus alſo were the Horſes prepared for the Battel, by Art, as well as by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Thus are Chriſtians alſo prepared; there is an <hi>Armour of God</hi> prepared for them, which they are to put on. And Chriſt who go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneth his own Chariot, his Church, will take care of them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 46 5. God is in the midſt of the Church, therefore it ſhall not fall, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27. 3. <hi>I the Lord do keep it, I will water it every moment, laſt any hurt it, I will keep it night and day, Pſal.</hi> 125. 2. As the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains are round about <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> ſo the Lord is round about his People; <hi>He will create a defence upon their glory, a cloud, and a ſmoak,</hi>
                  <pb n="713" facs="tcp:61084:361"/>
                  <hi>and a flaming fire upon her Aſſemblies, a Tabernacle, a place of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, a cover from the ſtorm, and from Rain,</hi> Iſa, 4. 4, 5.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And laſtly; <hi>Chriſt expecteth this from you.</hi> Thus much me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks is ſignified to us by the phraſe, <hi>I have compared thee to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Horſes in</hi> Pharaoh<hi>'s Chariots.</hi> The Prince expects that his <hi>War-horſes</hi> ſhould ſerve him in the day of Battel, that they ſhould not be afraid of armed men, of Drums or Trumpets, &amp;c. It is the ſervice we have to do for Chriſt in the uſe of the habits of his grace beſtowed upon us, and in thankfulneſs for all the goodneſs he hath ſhewed us in more calm and quiet times. That Chriſtian ill requiteth the Lord for all his feeding in green and fat Paſtures, who when an Evil day comes, and the Lord by his Providence calleth out to the World, <hi>Who is on my ſide?</hi> Who is afraid, or aſhamed to appear for God, own his Truths, and ſacred Inſtitutions? Chriſt hath not compared us to <hi>Aſſes,</hi> that couch under burdens, but to a more generous ſort of creatures, to Horſes, to Horſes in <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s <hi>Chariots.</hi> Look upon your ſelves as ſuch. Be not like the cowardly Cur, that runs away as ſoon as a Man takes but up a ſtone to throw at him. We read of Chriſtians in the Primitive times, that they would expoſe themſelves to their Tormentors, telling them, <hi>They were Chriſtians.</hi> In Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s time the Perſecutors curſed the People of God, and ſaid, <hi>They had a mind to burn.</hi> Oh that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in theſe times had ſuch a courage, as the <hi>wicked Apoſtates,</hi> and their moſt furious Adverſaries; might think that Chriſtians in the defence of the Goſpel, had a mind to ſuffer whatever their wicked hands durſt do againſt them. Certainly he who hath given Chriſtians the grace of fortitude and courage, expecteth the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But ſecondly; This Doctrine <hi>calleth aloud to Chriſtians for Unity.</hi> Chriſt hath not compared us to Horſes in a Field, but in a Chariot, where they are united. Horſes in Chariots draw by couples, and that maketh their draught the more eaſie. Oh that my head were a fountain of waters, my eyes rivers of tears, that I might weep day and night for the Diviſions amongſt the People of God. This hath made almoſt every Horſe draw ſingly, and hath almoſt mired the Lord's Chariots.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I beſeech you conſider how God's Enemies are united. <hi>Gebal, Ammon,</hi> and <hi>Amalek; Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Atheiſts</hi> are united in their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to Truth and Holineſs, againſt every perſon, and every<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thing which hath any thing of the ſtamp and impreſſion of God
<pb n="714" facs="tcp:61084:362"/>
upon it. Is it not time for all <hi>Proteſtants</hi> to unite, all ſuch eſpecially as are Chriſtians not in name only, but in deed, and in truth? It may be we cannot unite in every Principle or <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice;</hi> we have different apprehenſions, and we cannot reconcile them: Can we not <hi>forbear one another in love?</hi> who hath made us more infallible than our Brethren? 2. I beſeech you conſider, <hi>what already have been the fruits of our breaches, and diſunion, and what is likely to be the further iſſue of them, if not in time prevented. Popery</hi> is increaſed; many abſurd and blaſphemous Opinions are propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; what will the end of theſe things be? Shall we not be made a common prey, <hi>pugnant ſinguli, vincuntur univerſi;</hi> while men fight ſingly, they are overcome univerſally. You that have any ſavour of the things of God upon your Souls, that have ſenſe of things, and how diſmal the ſtate of them is, and is like to be, I beſeech you lay theſe things to heart. The whole Miniſtry of the Goſpel, the Ordinances of God are ſtruck at. One Truth of God is cryed down after another. Lay theſe things to heart, and while you are perſuaded that your Brethren own the ſame <hi>common Faith</hi> with you, and purſue the ſame common deſign of the glory of God, and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as the means to it, give an allowance to them in ſome things wherein you differ; do not arrogate Infallibility to your ſelves; believe it is poſſible you alſo may be miſtaken; and though you are bound to live by your own Faith, and walk according to your own Faith, and Perſuaſion, yet do not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce an <hi>Anathema</hi> againſt all that are not juſt of your ſize. Lay aſide your heats and animoſities, and your differences, which are of far leſs moment than the whole Intereſt of Chriſt and his Goſpel is. I ſhall conclude my Diſcourſe, as the Apoſtle begins his ſecond Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the <hi>Philippians; If therefore there be any conſolation in Chriſt, if any comfort of love, if any fellowſhip of the Spirit, if any bowels of mercy:</hi> Let me add, If any concern for the honour and glory of God, or the Intereſt of Chriſt or Religion in the Nation, fulfil the compariſon of my Text, and be you yet at laſt <hi>like a company of Horſes in</hi> Pharaoh<hi>'s Chariots, being like minded, having the ſame love, being of one accord, and of one mind, and do the ſame thing in bearing a joint Teſtimony for God.</hi>

               <p>THE Bleſſed Lover in this ſong goes on yet in the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of his Spouſe.

Only there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing looks a little odd according to the guiſe of our Country, where Women uſe to wear <hi>ropes of Pearl</hi> about <hi>their Necks</hi> or <hi>Wriſts,</hi> or <hi>Jewels</hi> on their <hi>Breaſts</hi> or in their <hi>Ears,</hi> but how theſe ſhould reflect a beauty on her Cheeks is hard to underſtand, but we underſtand not the <hi>faſhions of other Countries.</hi> We read, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3. 21. Of <hi>Noſe Jewels</hi> in uſe amongſt the Jews, which <hi>dreſſers</hi> of Women in our times would find hard to put on And if a way could be found for that, we ſhould judge them very ſtrange <hi>Ornaments.</hi> But let me firſt open the words. Our tranſlators add ſome Words here to compleat the ſenſe. In the <hi>Hebrew</hi> is no more then, <hi>Thy Cheeks are comely with rows</hi>—and <hi>thy Necks with Chains.</hi> Our <hi>Interpreters</hi> not being able to conceive, what rows (except of Jewels) could adorn the face, have added theſe Words to the former part: Nor able to conceive what <hi>Chains</hi> ſhould adorn the Neck of a woman except <hi>of Gold or Pearls;</hi> And having added <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="716" facs="tcp:61084:363"/>
                  <hi>Interpreters</hi> agreed about the tranſlation of the other Words, either as to the matter or form. As to the form the <hi>Septuagint</hi> reads the Word as a <hi>queſtion. How comely are thy Cheeks?</hi> But moſt other Interpreters read them poſitively, and indicatively, as we read them; that difference is not much. But there is yet a greater difference as to the matter of the words, for the Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty read it, How fair are thy Cheeks, <gap reason="foreign">

Pagnin, Montanus,</hi> and moſt others read it according to the ſenſe our tranſlation puts upon it. Let me at leaſt attempt to reconcile this difference. The Word is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which unqueſtionably derives from the <hi>radical Word</hi>

But it is hard to put that ſenſe of it upon this Text, though the <hi>Septu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agint,</hi> and thoſe that follow them, do it. For what ſenſe can we make of this? <hi>Thy Cheeks are</hi> comely with <hi>Turtles.</hi> But ſome of the Hebrew Doctors tell us, that the word ſignifieth alſo a <hi>kind</hi> of <hi>Womens Ornaments,</hi> and <hi>Pagnin</hi> tells us that <hi>R. David</hi> ſaith it ſignifieth <hi>Pearls</hi> or <hi>Jewels,</hi> ſet in <hi>order;</hi> ſome think it was an <hi>Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> that had ſomething of the figure of the <hi>Turtle.</hi> They ſay the <hi>Turtle</hi> hath this name from the mournful noiſe which it maketh, ſounding in our Ears like this Word. Others think the <hi>French word Tour</hi> (which we have now made <hi>Engliſh)</hi> ſignifying an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament of the head, and the Engliſh word <hi>Attire</hi> both derive from this <hi>Hebrew</hi> word. From this diſcourſe you may gather, that the penury of words in the Hebrew tongue, conſtraining them to ſignify ſeveral things by the ſame word, is the reaſon of the
<pb n="717" facs="tcp:61084:363"/>
difference of <hi>Interpreters</hi> in the tranſlation of the <hi>Hebrew Text</hi> both in this, and many other Texts. It is moſt probable, that Women had ſome <hi>Ornaments</hi> in thoſe Countries, which they expreſſed by this name, and that, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the Greek alſo did expreſs it (though our <hi>Lexicographers</hi> give us no ſuch account of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.) The learned <hi>Mercer</hi> obſerves that thoſe Interpreters who tranſlate the words, <hi>as the Turtle,</hi> are miſtaken both in the affix which is not <gap reason="foreign">

The word certainly ſignifieth ſome <hi>Ornaments</hi> in thoſe times uſed by Women to adorn their heads with, called by this name becauſe of the order and exceeding neatneſs of them, or becauſe of their figure, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion. Our Interpreters have thought fit, to Interpret the word concerning thoſe Ornaments, though we do not exactly know their faſhion.

               <p>By this time you may eaſily underſtand the <hi>Propoſition,</hi> the ſenſe of which according to this explication is,</p>
               <p>The Spouſe of Chriſt, whether by her we underſtand the Church which is a body made up of ſeveral believers, or a particular believer, is not only inwardly comely, and beautiful, in reſpect of thoſe habits of grace, by which ſhe is made (as the Pſalmiſt expreſſeth it) <hi>all glorious within,</hi> but ſhe is alſo viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly comely, in her more external appearance, by her orderly converſation, according to the Laws of God, which is as an Ornament or Chain of well ſet Jewels unto her, and by her ready ſubmitting her Neck to the yoke of Chriſts Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, his ſeveral Precepts being like a Chain <hi>of Gold</hi> or <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſtones</hi> about her neck. This is enough for the explication, the Child of God is not only inwardly, but outwardly holy, and his holineſs is a great beauty to him. Here are two things.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> The Child of God, is not only inwardly, but externally holy.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2. This</hi> external holineſs is to him a great beauty.</p>
               <p>A Child of God hath a <hi>good heart,</hi> but that's not all; he muſt live a good life: this is a point exceeding obvious whether we conſider, 1. The <hi>Rule by which he walketh.</hi> Or Secondly, The <hi>influence that the heart hath upon the life.</hi> Or 3. <hi>The example he is to follow.</hi> Or 4. The <hi>Patterns of holy men upon Scripture record.</hi> 5. Or the <hi>promiſes of God</hi> to whom they are made, Or 6. The deſcriptions of good men in holy writ. Or 7. <hi>The end which he ſerveth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. If we conſider the <hi>Divine rule,</hi> it reacheth not the heart alone, but the outward man. <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine</hi> before men (ſaith our Saviour) that <hi>they may ſee your good works. Shew me thy ſaith by thy works,</hi> faith <hi>James, Faith without works is dead.</hi> It were endleſs to reckon up the ſeveral Texts of Scripture by which God hath directed the Government of our <hi>Tongues,</hi> our <hi>Eyes,</hi> our <hi>Ears,</hi> our <hi>Hands,</hi> our <hi>Feet.</hi> In ſhort the ſeveral Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts for good works are all proofs of this.</p>

               <p n="4">4. See the <hi>Patterns of holy men</hi> upon <hi>Scriptural record, Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> all the holy Servants of God, you will find their holineſs did not lye only in the obedience of their heart, but of their whole external converſe, a ſtrict walking with God in obedience to his will.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Obſerve the <hi>promiſes of God,</hi> they are not onely made to <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> and the more inward habits of the mind, but to <hi>external</hi> acts, ſuch as <hi>Prayer, hearing the</hi> Word, <hi>Sanctification of the Sabbath,</hi> ſhewing mercy to the poor, doing juſtly, walking righteouſly, </p>
               <p n="6">6. The <hi>deſcriptions of holy men alſo make out this.</hi> They are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to be men <hi>fearing God,</hi> and <hi>eſchewing evil,</hi> walking in the Commandments of God. Working righteouſneſs, all which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions ſignify that a believer muſt not only be internally holy, but externally ſo alſo.</p>
               <p>Laſtly the <hi>end,</hi> which they ſerve ſhews alſo a neceſſity of it; they are <hi>lights</hi> to inlighten the World, and therefore they muſt not be hid under buſhels: They are <hi>Salt</hi> to ſeaſon the World, and therefore muſt be expoſed to their uſe, their end is to glorify God before men, which cannot be without an external, as well as an internal holineſs; thus the firſt thing appeareth. I have paſſed over theſe things, eaſy enough to have been extended into a much larger diſcourſe Becauſe it is a point ſo exceeding obvious and indeed agreed by all men. The 2d thing is that <hi>holineſs</hi> is <hi>a believers beauty,</hi> it is ſo in the Eyes of Chriſt which is here ſpoken of. Nor is this of any thing more difficult demonſtration then the other. What is that which we call beauty but an amiable exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal appearance of a Perſon, ariſing from a <hi>Symmetry of parts,</hi> a due
<pb n="723" facs="tcp:61084:366"/>
mixture, and Proportion of colours, in conformity to ſome <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Pattern</hi> or <hi>Idea.</hi> A Chriſtians <hi>Original Pattern</hi> is God the Father, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; <hi>be you holy at your Heavenly Father is holy:</hi> As I <hi>am holy,</hi> (ſaith the holy Writ.) What can be a Chriſtians beauty but his conformity to God, and that amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs which ariſeth from that. All Spiritual beauty is to be meaſured, from the <hi>ſymmetry</hi> of the Soul to the divine law. That which makes the Soul amiable to God and to all thoſe who are like God. This is <hi>holineſs.</hi> But I ſhall ſum up all in ſome few Words of application. I ſhall firſt obſerve from hence two or three <hi>Corollaries</hi> for our inſtruction, then cloſe all with a few words of exhortation.</p>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Rows of Jewels are things as to which a great Art is ſeen in the orderly diſpoſing of them.</hi> There is a ſtrange <hi>orderlineſs</hi> to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the Divine Precepts. Could you imagine a Family, a Church, a Common-wealth, any Society of men, in which the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral perſons, both in their ſingle, and relative capacities, lived up to the ſtrictneſs of the Divine Rule, reſpecting them, how orderly would they appear even in the Eye of humane Reaſon? All the uglineſs and diſorder that we ſee in mens Lives, in Families, Churches, Cities, Kingdoms (if you obſerve it) arifeth from mens deviations from the Divine Rule, through the impetuouſneſs of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortified paſſions.

               <p>

Let me therefore cloſe this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with a word or two of <hi>Exhortation.</hi> 1. To <hi>neglect other beauty.</hi> 2. <hi>To ſtudy this beauty more and more.</hi> 3. <hi>Not to Satisfy your ſelves,</hi> with mere pretences <hi>of inward purity, whiles your more exteriour converſation gives no evidence to it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. I ſay firſt to <hi>neglect other beauty,</hi> whether natural (though that be a great gift of God where it is found:) Or <hi>Artificial</hi> which is borrowed from Gold and Silver, and Precious Stones, and Jewels, and fine Cloaths, and Linnen, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider, <hi>This is not your beauty.</hi> That's our beauty which Commends us to our Husband Jeſus Chriſt. He regards not a fine face, nor well proportioned limbs, he regards not Jewels, and Ornaments, nor fine Clothes and Linnen. They are in his Eyes poor vile things. Leave theſe things to the men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the world that have nothing elſe to Commend them to the wantons of the world. The beauty of a Chriſtian lyeth not in theſe things, nay they are his ſhame, and deformity, as I ſhall by and by ſhew you.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly let me urge the Precept of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 9, <hi>Let women</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>adorn themſelves in modeſt apparel with ſhamefaſtneſs and ſobriety, not with broidered Hair, or Gold, or Pearls, or coſtly aray but (which becometh women, profeſſing Godlineſs,) with good works.</hi> Mark that phraſe <hi>(which becometh women proſeſſing Godlineſs)</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, theſe vanities of <hi>broidered Hair,</hi> Gold, Pearl, coſtly aray, may become men and women of the world, and commend them to the world, but they do not become men and Women profeſſing Godlineſs, they are not to approve themſelves to the vain Perſons of the World, but to Chriſt alone, theſe things Commend no Soul to Chriſt, good works, an holy life and converſation according to the rule of the Goſpel, that and nothing but that will Commend a Soul to God, that is the only adorning which becometh wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that profeſs to Godlineſs. You have the like in <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 3. Speaking of good women <hi>whoſe adorning</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>let it not be the outward adorning of playting the hair, and of wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gold, and putting on of apparel, but let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the Ornament of a meek, and quiet Spirit, which before God is of great price, for</hi>
                  <pb n="727" facs="tcp:61084:368"/>
                  <hi>after this manner in</hi> the old time <hi>the holy women alſo who truſted in God adorned themſelves,</hi> I do know the Common Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which ſome put upon theſe Texts, as if the Apoſtle did not wholly forbid theſe <hi>Ornaments,</hi> but only forbad Chriſtians to look upon theſe things as their only <hi>Ornaments,</hi> ſo as to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the adorning of the <hi>hidden man of the heart.</hi> Nor indeed do I think theſe Texts to contain an abſolute <hi>prohibition of theſe things</hi> to all women that are <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and <hi>at all times.</hi> I do know that our Saviour ſeemeth to allow <hi>ſoſt rayment to thoſe that are in Kings houſes.</hi> Reaſon alloweth an aray to Perſons according to the <hi>Station</hi> and <hi>quality</hi> they take up, and are in in the World Religion doth not contradict it. But when I conſider, 1. <hi>What</hi> of men, and womens eſtates, which God hath given them to Cloth <hi>the naked,</hi> to <hi>feed the hungry</hi> &amp;c. (The neceſſities of their families being firſt provided for) <hi>is ſpent on theſe things,</hi> 2. <hi>The difference between habits for diſtinction</hi> of <hi>Perſons in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy</hi> and <hi>habits</hi> for <hi>vanity,</hi> where there is no ſuch diſtinction. 3. <hi>The time that is ſpent in</hi> the dreſſing up worms in this manner. 4. <hi>The proneneſs of our hearts to value our ſelves upon theſe accou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trements.</hi> I cannot but think that there is more forbidden in thoſe Texts, then that Chriſtians ſhould look upon theſe as their <hi>only</hi> or <hi>Principal Ornaments.</hi> Eſpecially when I alſo conſider that as God in the old Teſtament forbad his People <hi>the habits of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens:</hi> So he hath commanded his People, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 2. <hi>Not to be conformed to this World, Rom.</hi> 12. 2.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, <hi>Conſider the ſinfulneſs of ſome of theſe things.</hi> Where theſe <hi>adornings</hi> are beyond the <hi>quality of Perſons,</hi> and beyond what their eſtates will bear, in conſiſtency with that Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of good works which God requireth of them, where they are <hi>temptations</hi> to draw out the luſts of others: Where they are <hi>offences</hi> and <hi>Scandals</hi> to ſuch as fear God, they are doubtleſs <hi>

               <p>Conſider laſtly, how inconſiſtent theſe things are with that <hi>Miniſtring to the neceſſity of Saints: That richneſs in good works,</hi> that <hi>mortification.</hi> The <hi>declaration of our ſenſe of Gods diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations to us,</hi> which are the duties of Chriſtians: God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires that we ſhould <hi>labour with our hands, that we may have to give to him that needeth, Eph.</hi> 4. 28.

Are you <hi>rich in the World,</hi> and will your eſtate bear ſuch expences, and hath not God charged ſuch, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 18. To <hi>do good,</hi> to be <hi>rich in good works, ready to diſtribute, willing to Communicate, laying up in ſtore for your ſelves a good foundation, againſt the time to come, that you may lay hold on Eternal life.</hi> Can you be rich in clothes, and habits, and rich in good works alſo? If you could doth not the Apoſtle tell you, <hi>That thoſe who are Chriſts have crucified the fleſh, with the affections and luſts thereof, Gal.</hi> 5. 24. Is this your crucifixion of the fleſh with its affections and luſts? What is a gratifying and pleaſing the fleſh, what is a making proviſion for the affections, and luſts of it, if this be not? To what other uſe, or end can theſe things be? Doth adorning our ſelves with Jewels and Silks, and Ribbands, patchings and paintings, ſpeak a mortified heart to the World? a Crucified heart to the fleſh? They ſpeak nothing leſs then this; ſurely they ſpeak fleſh, that is wanton, and proud, and puffed up. It is the Obſervation of a learned Author, That heretofore Chriſtians wounded their fleſh for <hi>mortification,</hi> we wound it for <hi>pride, folly</hi> and <hi>vanity;</hi> the Ears are boared to hang Jewels in: But how much better is that boaring of the Ear mentioned, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40. 6. <hi>A boaring of the E ars</hi> in Teſtimony that we will be the Lords Servants for ever.

               <p n="2">2. Secondly, <hi>Study holineſs,</hi> If you will look after <hi>beauty,</hi> ſtudy the true, the <hi>inward beauty,</hi> that which commendeth the Soul to God; your labour for the other many times deſtroys your Souls, it conſumes the time which ſhould be ſpent in reading, in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, faſting.

The beauty vain Perſons labour for is but <hi>Jezebels</hi> beauty; ſtudy the beauty of <hi>Sarah,</hi> of which you read in, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 5. The Ornaments with which holy Women of old, adorned themſelves, Ornaments which become ſuch, as do not profeſs Pride, and vanity, but Godlineſs. Put Chriſts Chains about your Necks, his rows upon your Cheeks. The Phariſees prided themſelves in their <hi>Phylatteries.</hi> They did ill to adorn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with thoſe Scrowls of the law in their Skirts, while they lived not up to the rule, and true ſenſe of it in their lives, but there are no ſuch rows of Jewels as thoſe of Gods Precepts.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Laſtly (with which I ſhall conclude this diſcourſe) <hi>Satisfy not your ſelves with dreams, and fancies of meer inward, Spiritual beauty.</hi> I again tell you it muſt be a counterfeit. There may be an external appearing beauty, without any inward beauty, but that is but a counterfeit, there can be no <hi>inward beauty</hi> without an external beauty. <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> too muſt be ſhewed by works, where <hi>holineſs to the Lord</hi> is ingraven in any man or Womans heart, it will alſo be written (to uſe the phraſe of the Prophet <hi>Zechariah, Ch.</hi> 14. 20.) upon the very <hi>bells of the Horſes—yea every pot in</hi> Hieruſalem <hi>ſhall be holineſs to the Lord.</hi> We have a great cry of Religion, and for Religion in theſe days. We hear a bundance talking as if there were no Saints in the World but themſelves, but wherein doth their Religion lye? In a fine tongue; they can (as <hi>Luther</hi> ſaid) <hi>Crepare Chriſtum</hi> make a crack, and boaſt of Chriſt. But where are the <hi>rows of Jewels</hi> upon their Cheeks? The <hi>Chains of Gold</hi> about their Necks? Where
<pb n="730" facs="tcp:61084:370"/>
is their ſtrict, and conſciencious waiting upon God in Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? Where's the fear of God to be ſeen in their lives? Theſe times make me often to think of that ſaying of <hi>Hierom, Grande eſt Chriſtianum eſſe, non dici.</hi> To be a Chriſtian that is a great, and difficult thing, to be called ſo, that is a poor and mean, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry eaſy thing. Look abroad and ſee how few ſerious, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Chriſtians are to be found in the World, how few who in any meaſure anſwer that great name by any ſeverity of life, and converſation. If <hi>Luxuriouſneſs</hi> in meats, and drinks, if exceſs in apparel and dreſſes, if griping the poor, if cruelty towards Perſons in diſtreſs, and oppreſſion, and covetouſneſs, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding houſe to houſe ſpeak Chriſtians, we have too much of theſe things even amongſt Profeſſors: But if a true believer muſt ſhew forth his faith, by works of piety towards God, and works of righteouſneſs, and charity towards men, if they muſt abound in good works, and their light muſt ſhine before men ſo as they may ſee their good works, and glorify their Father which is in Heaven, how ſmall is the number of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in this age wherein there is ſo much talk of it; We muſt ſay of many Profeſſors to Religion as once <hi>Iſaac ſaid of Jacob,</hi> Gen. 27. 22. <hi>The voice is Jacobs voice,</hi> but the <hi>hands are Eſaus hands.</hi> There are many whoſe voice indeed is <hi>Jacobs voice,</hi> they talk like Saints, O but their hands are <hi>Eſau</hi>'s hands. Let them come unto you that you may feel them. Their habits are <hi>Eſau</hi>'s habit; they <hi>eat</hi> and drink like <hi>Eſau,</hi> they deal in the World like <hi>Eſau.</hi> They are Virgins upward, beaſts downward, monſters in Religion. Oh let not this be any of your Character. Know it to be your duty, as much to abound in <hi>Prayer, hearing, faſting, exerciſes</hi> of <hi>repentance,</hi> and <hi>mortification,</hi> as others make it their vanity to abound in good words, coſtly apparel, in Pride and Luxury. You muſt have <hi>Chriſts rows upon your Cheeks,</hi> his <hi>Chains about your Necks.</hi> I ſhall conclude with that of the Apoſtle to the <hi>Philippians, Philip.</hi> 4. 8. 9.</p>
               <p>Finally (Brethren) whatſoever things are true, whatſoever things are honeſt, whatſoever things are juſt, whatſoever things are pure, whatſoever things are lovely, whatſoever things are of good report, if there be any vertue, and if there be any praiſe, think on theſe things.</p>

               <p>THE <hi>Chaldee Paraphraſt</hi> out of his unreaſonable fondneſs to make this whole Song to be nothing elſe but a diſcourſe betwixt God and the <hi>Congregation of Iſrael,</hi> thus gloſſeth upon theſe words.</p>

                  <q>It was then ſaid unto Moſes go up to the firmament, and I will give thee there two Tables of ſtone cut out of the Sapphire of the throne of Glory, ſhining like the beſt Gold ordered with lines writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with my own Fingers, in which are ingraven the Ten command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which are more pure, <hi>then Silver purified ſeven times,</hi> &amp;c.</q> I ſhould hardly mention this ancient Jewiſh Paraphraſt ſo often, but to convince the <hi>Atheiſtical</hi> Spirits of latter ages, that the Jews did not underſtand this excellent Song as a meer wanton Love Song, between <hi>Solomon</hi> and the <hi>Daughter of Pharaoh.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did <hi>Gregory Nyſſen, Gregory</hi> the great, nor <hi>Bernard,</hi> who with others of the Ancients have wrote Commentaries upon it, ſo underſtand it, though they agreed not with this <hi>Paraphraſt</hi> concerning the Perſons in it.

               </p>
               <p>I am not much ſatisfied with the tranſlation of the words by our interpreters, becauſe I find no other Interpreters agreeing with them. The 70 interpreters who are followed by thoſe who made the <hi>Arabick Verſion</hi> interpret it <hi>images,</hi> or <hi>pictures.</hi> The <hi>Syriack</hi> Interpreters tranſlate it <hi>Chains.

I think the <hi>Tigurine Verſion</hi> tranſlateth it beſt. They tranſlate it <hi>Ornament a convenientia,</hi> Convenient Ornaments. It
<pb n="732" facs="tcp:61084:371" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is certain the word ſignifieth ſome ſuch <hi>Ornaments</hi> as Women uſed in thoſe times, and Countries. Ornaments differ both in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Countries, and in ſeveral Ages in the ſame Country, ſo that it is no wonder if Interpreters are at a loſs ſo many hundreds of years ſince, exactly to tranſlate words ſignifying things ſo variable after ſuch a diſtance of time, and in another country.

               <p n="1">1.

It is a rule in <hi>Divinity; omnia opera Trinitatis adextra ſunt indiviſa.</hi> All the works of the Trinity, out of itſelf, and with relation to the creatures, are individed, what is the Act of one Perſon, is the work of all three Perſons. The <hi>Father created,</hi> the Son createth, and the Holy Ghoſt createth. So in the works of <hi>Providence.</hi> The <hi>Father work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth hitherto, and the Son worketh.</hi> This is eminently true in that noble <hi>work of Providence.</hi> The Collation of ſpecial grace, <hi>John.</hi> 14. 23. <hi>If any man love me, he will keep my words, and my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will love him, and We will come unto him,</hi> and make <hi>Our</hi> abode <hi>with him.</hi> The Text being thus opened, you ſee to what point in Divinity it leadeth us.

               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> That Chriſt is ready to give out more grace, more Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Ornaments to the Souls of believers, where he ſeeth the Cheeks of his Saints already comely with Rows of Jewels, and their Necks with Chains of Gold, he will ſtill be preparing for them Chains of Gold, with Spots of Silver.</p>
               <p>To this purpoſe is the promiſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 12. <hi>To him that hath ſhall be given,</hi> and <hi>he ſhall have in more abundance.</hi> It was the end of his coming into the World, not only that his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might have life, but that they might have it more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, <hi>John</hi> 10. 10. And he acteth in the diſpenſations of his grace according to, and in fulfilling of the end of that his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

(and that indeed is properly the Ornament of a believer) he giveth abundantly. He fills the Souls of his People with joy, and peace in believing, that their Souls may abound in hope, through <hi>the power of the Holy Ghoſt, Rom.</hi> 15. 13. He maketh the Souls of his People to <hi>abound in loves;</hi> hence the aboundings in this gracious habit are made the matter of the Apoſtles prayer, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. 12. They could not grow in grace if he were not alwaies ready to give out more grace, for all <hi>Acts</hi> muſt proceed from habits and a growth, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement in gracious Acts muſt flow from an increaſe of the power, and principle of acting. If any one asks the reaſon of this <hi>Liberality of Chriſt to his Spouſe it</hi> is not hard to aſſign it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That fulneſs of Grace and Love which is in him</hi> is the great ground and cauſe of it; what makes the loving Husband who knoweth that his Wife is already full ſtockt with Cloaths, and Linnen, and Rings and Jewels, and other Ornaments, that yet he can never go abroad but he muſt bring her home ſomething to add to her ſtock in theſe things, but only firſt <hi>he finds that his purſe will hold out to it;</hi> He hath wherewithal to do it. 2. His <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>kindneſs</hi> to <hi>his Wife is ſuch as conſtraineth him to it,</hi> so as he can never think ſhe hath enough, and he is ſtill giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her as if ſhe had nothing. Chriſt is a fountain of fulneſs, the fulneſs of the Godhead dwelt in him bodily, and of <hi>his ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> (ſaith <hi>John) we receive grace for grace;</hi> The full fountain runneth over, neither doth he loſe any thing by his communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, while he giveth grace, he is but like unto the <hi>Sun</hi> which loſeth no light by imparting its light to the World: Then his Love to his Saints is infinite &amp; tranſcendent, he muſt not be out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyed by his creatures. Doth therefore a loving Husband when his Wife hath already a competent wardrobe, and a competent num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Ornaments, yet add to her ſtores, and ſo much to ſupply her wants as to ſhew his own Love and kindneſs to her? How much more ſhall the Lord Jeſus do it? So that in this reaſon there are indeed three. The firſt is that infinite fulneſs of grace that is in him, which cannot terminate it ſelf in him, without a communication to the creature, the Second is the nature of his communication which is ſuch, that he loſeth nothing by it. He ſaith <hi>we will make thee, borders of Gold,</hi> men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are not ſo forward to give what they have <hi>aliunde,</hi> from without themſelves: As what they have from themſelves and
<pb n="735" facs="tcp:61084:372"/>
are no loſers by the communication of. The term <hi>make</hi> doth not denote a <hi>non praeexiſtence.</hi> All the Chains of Gold with which Chriſt adorneth his Spouſe are coaevous with Chriſt himſelf, given out in the purſuance of an Eternal purpoſe, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed with the blood of Chriſt, but it ſignifieth that Chriſt hath them of his own. And then thirdly, <hi>His exceeding Love to his Spouſe</hi> cauſeth the giving of them out. It is ſaid of <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 18. 5. <hi>That he was preſſed in Spirit and Teſtified,</hi> &amp;c. Chriſt is preſſedin Spirit, with Love to the believing Soul. His heart is <hi>raviſhed</hi> as he afterward expreſſeth it in this ſong, <hi>Thou <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aſt raviſhed my heart, my Siſter, my Spouſe.</hi> This love is the great and firſt moving cauſe of theſe communications; as the loving husband that hath an eſtate which will bear it, and a Wife wherein he greatly delighteth, is alwaies giving her ſuch things as he judgeth will be pleaſing and acceptable unto her; ſo our bleſſed Lord, having firſt made his grace acceptable to the Soul, and then loving that Soul that hungreth and thirſteth after him, with a tranſcendent love cannot but be daily Satisfying ſuch a Soul with his good things.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſecond Reaſon of this is the <hi>Renewing wants of his Spouſe.</hi> Love doth not give<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Nogood Soul hath ſo much grace, but it ſtill wants. A prudent husband though very loving and tender, may judg his Wife hath Ornaments enough, and therefore may ceaſe to add to her ſtock, though ſhe may not have ſome particular Ornament, becauſe though ſhe hath it not yet ſhe may not want it, and it would be to her of no profitable uſe, only it may be, ſerve for Pride or oſtentation, but no tender husband with-holds from his Wife what he knoweth her to need. But the Child of God never hath ſo much faith, but he ſeeth cauſe to cry out, <hi>Lord help my unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,</hi> he is in daily want of Spiritual ſtrength, complaining of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and impotency, ſo as ſupplies of grace are a daily good to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Souls, and Chriſt can withhold no ſuch thing from them. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire</hi> doth yet more engage the love of a correlate, and the more paſſionate and vehement the deſire of the beloved is, the more he
<pb n="736" facs="tcp:61084:373"/>
that loves moveth towards her Satisfaction. The <hi>Philoſopher</hi> ſaith, to Love is to will that which is good to another, though indeed, love rather lyeth in a complacency which one taketh in another, of which the <hi>willing of good</hi> is but a firſt fruit, and an effect, good he tells us is that which <hi>all deſire.</hi> The nature of good lyes in a <hi>Sutableneſs</hi> and <hi>conveniency</hi> to our needs, for the ſupply of ſome vacuity, or emptineſs in us, all the effluxes and emanations of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace are ſuch, ſuted to ſome great wants of our Souls, and not only ſo, but alſo to the deſires of every gracious man and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who is continually crying, <hi>give, give</hi> and God cannot be wanting either to ſupply the neceſſities, or to anſwer the cravings, and importunities of his Peoples Souls. He hears the deſire of the humble, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10. 17. And <hi>giveth</hi> them their <hi>hearts deſire, Pſal.</hi> 21. 3.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>The intereſt of Gods own honour and glory is concerned in his giving of more grace.</hi> The loving husband buyeth his Wife Chains, and Jewels. And fine Clothes, and when ſhe hath a good ſtock he is yet adding to the ſtock; his love to her, his deſire to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy her deſires ſo far as he is able in all things convenient, are the great grounds, but yet he hath alſo ſome Eye to his own honour and Reputation, by it he is taken notice of in the World as one that is able to do ſuch things, and alſo as one to whom his Wife is very dear, this bleſſed Lover firſt aimeth at his own honour. <hi>Hereby</hi> faith Chriſt <hi>is your Father glorified if you bring forth fruit;</hi> much fruit of <hi>holineſs</hi> requireth much of the ſeed of God, much grace, as the Principle productive of it, for without his influence the Soul can do nothing. Further grace is neceſſary to uphold and maintain what grace he hath already beſtowed. It is alſo neceſſary to the production of that <hi>much fruit</hi> by which God is glorified by his People in the World. <hi>Grace</hi> in its true exerciſe is a lovely thing in the ſight of the World. Men that hate the practice of grace in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, yet love it in another. Hence the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 12. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth Chriſtians to <hi>have their converſation honeſt amongſt the Gentiles, that whereas they ſpeak againſt them as evil doers, they may by their good works, which they ſhall behold, glorifie God in the day of their viſitation.</hi> The Children of God are like Stars, which ſhine from a borrowed light; God hath all the honour of their well do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The man that walketh piouſly, devoutly, humbly in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation towards God, and in the exerciſe of juſtice and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, humility and meekneſs, mercy and charity, and bounty towards men, that is moderate and ſober in the uſe of proſperity, and patient

in the time of adverſity, doth by this converſation commend himſelf to all that part of the World, that hath yet any remainder of reaſon left, whoſe paſſions have not out-lawed their reaſon, and transformed them into Beaſts: And look as when the Wife is excellently attired, it draweth the Eyes of all after her, &amp; ſets them upon enquiry, whoſe Wife ſhe is, &amp; the honour redoundeth to the Husband, out of whoſe Purſe her Ornaments are known to come: So when men ſee Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans abounding in the fear of the Lord, in faith, &amp; love, in meekneſs, ſobriety, liberality to the Poor, love to their Enemies, a doing good to all, the honour doth not only redound to them, but the Name of Chriſt for their ſake is alſo well ſpoken of, the grace of God in them is commended and magnified.

other Ornaments, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 3. But you find not this ſentence at the foot of that account. <hi>Thus of old holy women who truſted in God adorned themſelves.</hi> With ſome of them you read that <hi>Jezebel</hi> adorned her ſelf when ſhe looked out at the window. Methinks this ſhould be a mighty humbling conſideration to a good man or woman who have adorned themſelves (after the manner of the World) that they might not be ſingular, but go like Perſons of their rank in the World, to think; Now I have decked, and adorned my ſelf at the expence of a great deal of mony, and I have ſpent in the doing of it a great deal of time. <hi>None of theſe things are Chriſts Ornaments,</hi> he hath allowed me to wear them, but theſe are none of thoſe things which I have received from him as my Saviour, and Redeemer; none of thoſe things which do commend me unto him, or make me at all more lovely in his ſight. Theſe are none of his rows of Jewels, or his Chains of Gold. None of that attire, in which I muſt, if ever I come to Heaven, be brought unto the King of Kings. This is none of that <hi>rayment of needlework</hi> mentioned, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 14. And would ſerious Chriſtians but entertain ſome ſuch thoughts, with what a contempt, and neglect would they look upon their other Ornaments, while their circumſtances make it but decent for them to wear them.

It is a ſhame to man to be beholden to a ſtone, or a little Earth, or a Silk-worm or a little flax for his Ornament; they are Ornaments that degrade the creature, and make a man beholden for his Honour and Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to things he treads upon. <hi>Grace</hi> is a ſupernatural thing, a thing that entreth into the ſubſtance of the Soul, and makes it ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially beautiful.

Other Ornaments com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend us but to our earthly Relations, and the vainer part of the World. Grace commends us to Chriſt, to his Father, to Saints and Angels.

Are there any Souls here whoſe iniquities are forgiven, whoſe ſins are covered, whoſe Souls are regenerated, renewed through the Sanctification of the Spirit, might not theſe Souls go into their Cloſets with <hi>David,</hi> and ſit down and ſay, <hi>Who are we, O Lord God!</hi> and what were our Souls, that the Lord ſhould bring us hitherto, that God ſhould waſh our Souls white in the Blood of the Lamb, and give us another Spirit than we had by Nature, a new Heart, a new Nature, that he ſhould make us partakers of the Divine Nature? But this was yet a ſmall thing in the ſight of God; he hath ſpoken alſo of his Servants for a great while yet to come; he hath ſpoken of more grace, of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for us <hi>Borders of Gold,</hi> with <hi>Badges of Silver. A faithful man ſhall abound with bleſſings.</hi> The beginnings of ſaving grace in the Soul, in the <hi>Juſtification</hi> of the <hi>Soul,</hi> and the firſt change and reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of our Natures, are bleſſings of that nature, as Eternity will be too ſhort a time to admire the Love of God in, and for; but will the Lord alſo add to his Servants ſtock, and increaſe their heap? will he be ſtill making and preparing new Ornaments for them, and giving further grace to them till all their wants ſhall be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, all their emptineſſes filled up? what manner of Love is this? Let our Souls be ſwallowed up in the admiration of this Love; Let our Souls, and all that is within us bleſs his holy Name.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>How doth this Notion call to us for all manner of holineſs?</hi> Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="743" facs="tcp:61084:376"/>
lyeth in two things, 1. The <hi>mortification</hi> of luſts and ſinful habits with the eſchewing and declining of ſinful acts, which are the fruit of thoſe trees. 2. <hi>The exerciſes of Godlineſs.</hi> Let me ſhortly preſs both, from this notion of out beloved's being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring ſtill, and making for us, <hi>Chains of Gold,</hi> and <hi>ſpots of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</hi> I will begin with the 2d.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The exerciſes of our ſelves unto Godlineſs,</hi> in all thoſe poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive duties which God requireth of us. Whether they may be more <hi>internal,</hi> ſuch as <hi>faith, hope, Love,</hi> or more <hi>external,</hi> in our more <hi>external communion</hi> with God, in Prayer, reading, hearing his word, receiving his holy Sacrament. Or in our <hi>converſation</hi> before and towards men: I ſhall preſs theſe from this notion upon a twofold conſideration.</p>
               <p n="2">1. Theſe <hi>exerciſes</hi> are the way to keep Chriſt ſtill at work, making for us theſe <hi>further Ornaments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2. They are the</hi> wearing, and uſing of theſe Ornaments.</p>
               <p>I ſay (firſt) theſe <hi>exerciſes</hi> will keep our Lords hand continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally at work, ſo as he will never be weary but be ſtill adding to our Ornaments of grace.</p>
               <p>I have had occaſion often in my former diſcourſes to hint to you, that although God be ingaged by his covenant, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, to bring the Souls of believers to glory, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to give out to them ſuch neceſſary ſupplies of grace, as ſhall make them meet for that inheritance, yet he is at liberty as to the gradual manifeſtations of his grace, to diſpenſe them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own infinite wiſdom, and his Peoples behaviour toward him. And the promiſes, of that grace, are made to the exerciſes of grace; Chriſt will be alwaies giving to thoſe, who are alwaies working out their Salvation with fear and trembling, exerciſing themſelves to Godlineſs. Theſe exerciſes are thoſe ſacred means, in the uſe, and not without the uſe of which he hath promiſed the influences of further grace. Men miſtake the promiſes of further grace, if they apprehend them made to any who do not their duty as to the fulfilling of them, when God had made thoſe large promiſes of which you read, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. He concludeth, <hi>v.</hi> 37. <hi>Thus faith the Lord God I will yet for this be inquired of by the houſe of</hi> Iſrael <hi>to do it for them.</hi> I will do it faith God, but yet I <hi>will be inquired of to do it for them.</hi> And for that promiſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 12. <hi>Whoſoever hath to him it ſhall be given, and he ſhall have more abundance,</hi> though by the foregoing verſe where our Saviour giveth a reaſon why he
<pb n="744" facs="tcp:61084:377" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſoake to his diſciples more plainly then to others. <hi>Becauſe it is given to you to know the myſteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, but to them it is not given.</hi> It ſeems to be a promiſe of further grace to thoſe to whom the firſt grace is given. Yet in <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 29. where the ſame <hi>promiſe</hi> is repeated and annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the parable of the <hi>talents,</hi> it is plainly to be underſtood of thoſe <hi>who have</hi> and uſe and <hi>improve</hi> what they have; ſo as take thoſe two Texts together, they are a promiſe indeed of further grace to be given, but to ſuch as make a juſt improvement of what grace God hath firſt beſtowed upon them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, Our <hi>exerciſes of Godlineſs are indeed the wearing of theſe Jewels.</hi> God gives men and women grace for their uſes, exerciſe is the uſe of the habit, and the end for which the Lord giveth it. What man will be continually buying clothes, and Ornaments for his Wife, who when ſhe hath them will not wear them? They are no Ornaments if they do not adorn us, how ſhall they adorn us in the ſight of the World (which cannot look into our hearts) unleſs we uſe and wear them? How can we wear, and exerciſe our grace, but by works of piety towards God, and goodneſs towards men? I will add yet one thing more.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is but ingenuity in us when our Lord is never weary of giving out to us, never ſatisfied, never thinking that he hath done enough for us, to be thinking we have not done, enough, nor can ever do enough for him, when we hear Chriſt ſaying to us, I <hi>will make them borders</hi> of <hi>Gold,</hi> and <hi>Ornaments of Silver.</hi> Should not we be ſaying, We will take ſome new ſteps in the ways of God, do ſome further acts of obedience then we have yet done, forget what is behind, and preſs on to what is before, unto the price of the high calling. Shall my beloved never think me fine enough? Adorned enough? And ſhall I ever think my ſelf, holy, and Spiritual enough? Serviceable enough to him in my generation? Shall not I be ever trying ſome new ways to advance Chriſt in the World, in my family, in my own Soul? Chriſt asks his diſciples, <hi>what do you do more then others, Matth.</hi> 5. You receive more, but what do you do more? Every good Chriſtian ſhould ask himſelf theſe two queſtions;</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>What do I more then others?</hi> I have more mercy then
<pb n="745" facs="tcp:61084:377"/>
others, what do I more than they? It is a ſhame for a Chriſtian to do no more than a Publican, a poor wretch that never taſted how good the Lord is; yea it is a ſhame for him to do no more than he who hath not received the meaſures of grace which he hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p>The 2d Queſtion I would have him propound to himſelf is, <hi>What do I do more than I was wont to do?</hi> Wherein do I go on from ſtrength to ſtrength? Wherein do I exceed my ſelf? Chriſt is preparing new meaſures of grace for, giving out new meaſures of grace to me? What new affections have I for Jeſus Chriſt? What new perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances do I do for him? The ſecond thing in which I told you <hi>Holineſs</hi> lay, was in <hi>mortification of luſts,</hi> and <hi>vitious habits, in eſchew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evil,</hi> &amp;c. Is our Lord making and preparing new Ornaments for Believers? How ſhould they be <hi>afraid to grieve and diſhonour him?</hi> This Notion affords a double Argument, whereby to preſs this ſecond part of Holineſs. 1. From <hi>Ingenuity.</hi> It is no way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genous, and becoming Chriſtians, to be pulling Jewels (as it were) out of Chriſt's Crown, while he is adding Jewels to our Crown, to be ſpoiling Chriſt of his Honour and Glory, while he is conſulting our honour and ſatisfaction. O therefore <hi>grieve not his holy Spirit!</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>There will by it ariſe a diſadvantage to your Immortal Souls.</hi> What Husband will ſtill be bringing <hi>new Ornaments to a froward and diſobedient Wife,</hi> that taketh no care to pleaſe him? Duty may oblige him to ſee that ſhe ſhall not want neceſſaries, but he will certainly cut her ſhort of ſuperfluities. God in this, as I have ſhewed you, deals after the manner of men. God's Cove nant, his Truth and Faithfulneſs to that, will oblige him, notwithſtanding his Peoples frowardneſs, to give them what grace is neceſſary to bring them to Heaven, but they muſt look to be cut ſhort of that <hi>more grace,</hi> which they otherwiſe might receive from him. The Soul of a Chriſtian, who giveth himſelf too much liberty, may be ſaved, but it will be as <hi>through fire.</hi> When <hi>David</hi> had fallen into thoſe two great ſins of <hi>Adultery</hi> and <hi>Murder,</hi> I remember God ſent <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> to him with this Meſſage, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 7, 8. <hi>I anointed thee King over</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and delivered thee out of the hands of</hi> Saul, <hi>and I gave thee thy Maſters Houſes, and thy Maſters Wives into thy boſom, and gave thee the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael <hi>and</hi> Judah; <hi>and if that had been too little, I would moreover have given unto thee ſuch and ſuch things; wherefore haſt thou deſpiſed the Commandment of the Lord, to do evil in his ſight,</hi> &amp;c.

from thoſe mercies which he had already received from God, but from that <hi>Love</hi> which was yet in his heart for him, and his <hi>readineſs</hi> to do much more for him than he had yet done. Think when you have any temptations to ſin againſt the Lord, that you hear Chriſt ſaying to you, I died upon the Croſs for you, I waſhed you in my Blood, I have pardoned thy ſins, clothed thee with my Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, changed thy heart, put my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

So as the moſt literal Tranſlation is, <hi>While the King is in his Round,</hi> whiles the King is round about. But by thoſe that are Criticks in the <hi>Hebrew Language,</hi> it is obſerved, that it is a word which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the form of their ſitting, or rather lying down to eat meat (for ſo was the faſhion of thoſe Countries.) The uſe of <hi>Tables</hi> and <hi>Stools</hi> was not then known, but they were wont to ſit or lie down, lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon their Elbows, and ſo to eat their meat. <hi>Samuel,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 11. (ſpeaking of their ſitting down to eat) ſaith, <hi>We will not ſit down until he come,</hi> that is, <hi>David's Jeſſe</hi>'s youngeſt Son. In the <hi>Hebrew</hi> it is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> we will not round it. Their meat was ſet on the ground, and their manner in eating was, to lie down round about their meat, and ſo eat, leaning on their Elbows, with their hand raiſing their head from the ground. The word only denotes to us their faſhion of ſitting, or lying in a round figure when they did eat, as we now ſit about Tables. Hence our Tranſlation is good enough to expreſs the ſenſe; <hi>While the King ſitteth at his Table<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  </gap>, <hi>accubitu, recubitu, circuitu,</hi> is alſo proper, becauſe thoſe words ſignifie the poſture in which they did eat in thoſe Countries. But there's no foundation for their Tranſlation, who underſtand it of a <hi>lying in Bed,</hi> it doubtleſs ſignifies, <hi>While the King ſitteth or lyeth at meat.</hi> It followeth <hi>[My Spikenard ſendeth forth the ſmell thereof.]</hi> The word tranſlated Spikenard is <gap reason="foreign">

Thus alſo <hi>Mercer</hi> interpreteth it, <hi>while Chriſt</hi> (ſaith he) is <hi>preſent with his Church, feeding it with his Word,</hi> the Church ſendeth forth the ſweet ſmells of Faith, grace, and good works, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>we are a ſweet ſavour unto God.</hi> And what he ſaith of the preſence of Chriſt with the Church, is as true concerning his preſence with the particular Soul that believeth in him; he who fitteth with another at the table hath a fellowſhip and communion with him <hi>while Chriſt vouchſafeth me his preſence.</hi> That I take to be the ſenſe of this Phraſe. You read in the <hi>Goſpel</hi> of a <hi>Marriage Supper</hi> which the King provided for his Son. And <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 9. You read of the <hi>Marriage Super</hi> of the Lamb, and God promiſeth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 20. That if any man opens to him while he ſtandeth at the door and <hi>knocketh,</hi> he will <hi>come in, and ſup with him.</hi> Which phraſes only note Gods nearneſs of preſence, intimacy of fellowſhip, and mmunion with his People.</p>

The next queſtion is what is here meant by <hi>the ſmell thereof. Tremellius</hi> tranſlates it <hi>Nardinum,</hi> that which is of ſpikenard, taking the <hi>Suffix<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> not as a Pronoun, but as forming a <hi>Noun adjective.</hi> So it ſhould be read thus, <hi>while the King ſitteth at his Table, that which is of Spikenard ſendeth forth the ſmell thereof,</hi> as if the <hi>ſmell</hi> related to the fulneſs of Grace which is in Chriſt. But I ſhall rather follow our own tranſlation. <hi>To ſend forth its Smell</hi> (ſaith Mr. <hi>Durham</hi> on the Text) <hi>is to be in lively exerciſe: Grace without ſmell or lively exerciſe being like flowers ſomewhat withered, that ſavour not, nor like unbeaten ſpice that ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nds not forth its ſavour.</hi> My grace is in exerciſe, that is his Senſe. But 2dly. The <hi>ſmell of a thing</hi> is that which <hi>diſcovers a thing,</hi> &amp; that both to <hi>our ſelves,</hi> and <hi>to others.</hi> Not only the motions, and vigorous actings and exerciſes of grace, but the <hi>Notifications</hi> and <hi>diſcoveries of it,</hi> both to our ſelves and others, depends upon Chriſts preſence with, and influence upon the Soul, that is poſſeſſed of it. Two <hi>Propoſitions</hi> of Doctrine ariſe from the words thus opened.</p>
               <p n="1">

                  <hi>2. Prop.</hi> The ſmell of the Saints grace doth much depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſts influence upon them and communion with them.</p>
               <p>I cannot but obſerve the connexion of this verſe with the two former. Her beloved had told her that <hi>her Cheeks were comely with Rowsrof Jewels, her Neck with Chains of Gold,</hi> he had been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending her for her grace &amp; holy converſation in the World. Ay (ſaith ſhe) while my beloved, whiles the King <hi>ſitteth at his Table, my Spikenard ſendeth forth the ſmell thereof.</hi> So long as it pleaſeth the Lord to keep my Soul company, to vouchſafe me his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious influence, ſo long I can do ſomething, thoſe habits of grace with which he hath bleſſed me, ſo long ſend forth their ſmell, but if he hath withdrawn himſelf from me, if he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth his bleſſed influences, my grace moveth not, ſmelleth not. But before I can reach that, I would willingly ſpeak ſomething to the firſt Propoſition concerning the nature of true grace, to ſend forth a ſmell, a peculiar ſmell.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1. Prop.</hi> True grace where it is will ſend forth a proper ſmell.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Philoſopher</hi> tells us that a ſmell <hi>is a quality of a mixed body which is drawn out by heat, ariſing from a due temperament of things in it which are hot and moiſt.</hi> But I have nothing to do with the <hi>Philoſophical notion</hi> of a ſmell, it is here without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion taken <hi>Metaphorically,</hi> and (as I before hinted) ſignifieth
<pb n="751" facs="tcp:61084:380"/>
                  <hi>Motion,</hi> and <hi>diſcovery.</hi> In all ſmells, that ariſe from things, there is. 1. <hi>Something of motion,</hi> the thing giving out the ſmell mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and ſends ſome quality into the air. The ſmell of grace ſignifies the motion and exerciſe of it, 2. <hi>There is in ſmells ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of diſcovery.</hi> By the ſmell of a thing we both diſcover <hi>the place</hi> of the thing, and know where it is, and alſo the <hi>nature of things</hi> in a great meaſure. I will open my meaning to you in this propoſition in three concluſions ſhortly.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1 Concluſ.</note> 
                  <hi>Where a truth of grace is in the Soul it will not lye hid,</hi> but <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it ſelf</hi> both <hi>to him</hi> that hath it, and to <hi>others,</hi> or at leaſt to one of them. A man may carry duſt in his pocket, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther himſelf, nor others with whom he converſeth know it, but he cannot ſo carry Musk or any odoriferous thing, if it be open; <hi>grace</hi> is a glorious light which God kindleth in the Soul and muſt not be hid, the Kingdom of Heaven which is <hi>within us</hi> as well as that <hi>without us</hi> is like unto leaven which cannot lye long hid in the meal. The <hi>Romans faith</hi> was ſpoken of <hi>through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the World, Rom.</hi> 1. 8. The <hi>elders</hi> obtained a <hi>good report, Heb.</hi> 11. 2. Grace where it is will be heard of, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 15. <hi>After I had heard of your faith, and your love to all the Saints.</hi> The like he ſaith to the <hi>Coloſſians, Coloſ.</hi> 1. 4. It is a thing to be ſeen in its fruits and effects. <hi>Shew me thy faith by thy works,</hi> and I will ſhew thee my faith by my works, <hi>James</hi> 2. 18. The grace that dwelleth in Chriſt hath a <hi>favour;</hi> ſo we had it before, <hi>Becauſe of the Savour of thy good Ointments therefore do the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins love thee.</hi> Grace is the <hi>ſalt of the Soul.</hi> Have <hi>ſalt in your ſelves</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) and ſale muſt not be without a Savour. It is compared to <hi>light,</hi> to <hi>fire,</hi> neither of which will be reſtrained.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2 Concluſ.</note> Secondly <hi>grace doth not ſend forth a Savour only, but a ſweet ſavour,</hi> like the Savour of <hi>Spikenard</hi> which is very <hi>grateful</hi> to the exterior ſenſes. Corruption, and luſt hath a ſavour. The Savour of the <hi>body of death</hi> is like the Savour of the <hi>dead body</hi> when putrefied. Luſts are like <hi>Solomons dead flyes</hi> which ſend forth a <hi>ſtinking Savour, Eccleſ.</hi> 10. 1. The Drunkard hath a ſmell of drink. The unclean Perſon hath a ſmell, but it is a ſtinking Savour; the <hi>Covetous Worlding,</hi> hath an earthy Savour and ſmell. But the Savour of the Saints grace is a ſweet ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Savour; his garments ſmell of <hi>Myrrh, Aloes, and Caſſia,</hi> His ſmell is <hi>as the ſmell of a field which the Lord hath bleſt</hi> (as

                  <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſaid of his Son, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27. 27. like the <hi>ſmell</hi> of <hi>Labanon,</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 14. 6. All the Children of Gods garments <hi>ſmell of Myrrh, Pſal.</hi> 45. 8. The Lord ſmelleth a <hi>ſweet Savour</hi> from them. He tells us <hi>he will not ſmell in the aſſemblies of wicked men, Amos</hi> 5. 1. But <hi>Paul was a ſweet Savour to God,</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 15. And the Apoſtle calls the alms of the Saints, <hi>an odor of a ſweet ſmell, a Sacrifice acceptable unto God, Eph.</hi> 4. 18. Their grace ſends forth a ſweet ſmell amongſt the People of God who are partakers of the ſame grace, yea even into the World, that even thoſe who know little of God, or of the myſteries of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom yet many times will ſpeak well of them and ſtand up in their defence.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Concluſ.</note> Though grace at all times ſends forth a ſmell, yet it doth not give a like <hi>ſmell,</hi> in all times and in all Perſons. Things (you know) that are moſt odoriferous, give out a ſmell according to the <hi>quantity</hi> of them, and according to the <hi>heat</hi> which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to them, a <hi>dram of Musk</hi> doth not give out ſuch a <hi>ſmell</hi> as a pound giveth, nor doth the moſt <hi>Aromatick Ointment</hi> in the <hi>Winter,</hi> or when it is kept in the cold, give out ſuch a ſmell, as when it is kept in a warm hand, or influenced by the warm beams of the Sun, or brought near to a warm fire, it is ſo with our habits of grace they have in them a ſweet ſmelling Savour, but exert it variouſly.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>According to the different degrees of grace in the Soul.</hi> Every Child of God hath his <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, his meaſure of grace, but every one hath not a <hi>like meaſure</hi> the faith of one is weak and little like a <hi>grane of muſtard ſeed</hi> which is the leaſt of all ſeeds, yet groweth up to a great tree, the faith of another may be ſo ſtrong as to remove mountains; according to the degrees of our infuſed habits of grace ſo will the ſmell of them be.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>According to the influence of Chriſt (who is the Sun of Righteouſneſs)</hi> ſo <hi>alſo will the ſmell of our grace be</hi> weaker or ſtronger. Three things contribute much to the ſmell of any odoriferous thing, 1. <hi>Heat,</hi> 2. <hi>Air,</hi> 3. <hi>Motion.</hi> Heat eliciteth and draweth out the <hi>odoriferous quality, air</hi> conveyeth it to the ſenſe, <hi>motion rarifieth the parts.</hi> Three things alſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the ſweet ſmell of the Saints grace.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>influence of the Sun of righteouſneſs</hi> upon the Soul. Therefore our Spouſe here ſaith, <hi>Whiles the King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſitteth at his table, my Spikenard ſendeth forth the ſmell thereof.</hi> 2. The <hi>Breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi>
                  <pb n="753" facs="tcp:61084:381"/>
                  <hi>of the holy Spirit</hi> which our Saviour compareth to the wind blowing where it liſteth, 3. <hi>Motion,</hi> the exerciſe of grace. As the Ointment doth not ſmell ſo ſweet in the box as when it is poured out, ſo it is grace in motion and exerciſe that cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſweet ſmell thereof. When <hi>Mary poured out</hi> her Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the houſe was filled with the <hi>Odour</hi> of it, <hi>John.</hi> 12. 3. and Chriſts name is compared in this Chapter to <hi>Ointment pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out,</hi> which is exceeding <hi>ſweet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Doth any now further ask whence it is that true grace where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it reſides will ſend forth its ſmell? I anſwer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It is from the Nature of it.</hi> It is ſome peculiar quality in the nature of a thing which makes it to ſend forth a pleaſant ſmell, what that is in natural things is not eaſy to determine. The <hi>Philoſopher</hi> faith it is a quality which ariſeth from a due temperament of ſomething that is dry, and Savoury, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which is moiſt; (It is an account of it which will hardly bear a ſtrict <hi>Examen)</hi> that it is a <hi>peculiar quality</hi> is moſt certain: So it is from the peculiar quality of gracious habits that they ſend forth their pleaſant ſmell, and of that I think a more eaſy and certain account may be given what it is. 1. <hi>Its conformity to the Holy Nature of God.</hi> 2. Its <hi>proportion</hi> and <hi>conformity</hi> to the reaſon of man. 3. Its life and activity. 1. <hi>In gracious habits there is a conformity to the Holy Nature of God.</hi> Hence gracious Souls are ſaid to be partakers of the Divine Nature, conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the image of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. The light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhews the greateſt part of mankind, that there is a God, Reaſon tells us, this God muſt be the Supreme, firſt, and moſt perfect Being, from hence it followeth, that the excellency of every thing lyeth in a conformity to God, who himſelf is the moſt perfect Being, and the Pattern of all perfection. This muſt make it the moſt amiable flower in the creation, and cauſeth it to give out a ſweet ſmell to all who have not loſt their ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, debauching their reaſon by their moſt ſordid luſts, and paſſions. 2. In all gracious habits and exerciſes, there is alſo a <hi>conformity to humane reaſon.</hi> There are in man ſome reliques of that reaſon in which much of the Original image of God where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in man was created lay, for <hi>Right reaſon</hi> (which <hi>Socinians</hi> ſo much talk of) it exiſteth in no man or Woman perfectly by nature, but ſome judgment remains of what is <hi>good</hi> and <hi>filthy,</hi> ſome <hi>notions</hi> of <hi>good and Evil,</hi> though very imperfect; now all
<pb n="754" facs="tcp:61084:382"/>
gracious habits will approve themſelves, and all gracious acts do approve themſelves to theſe notions, Hence all truly <hi>moral acts,</hi> are materially <hi>gracious acts:</hi> That is, the ſame acts which <hi>grace</hi> teacheth the good man to do, though from noble<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, in a better manner, and to a more pure, and noble End. So that ſo long as there are any men in the World, who have not outlawed their natural reaſon, and almoſt extinguiſhed it by their brutiſh luſts, and paſſions, <hi>grace</hi> will give a ſmell, and a good report. And the great hatred which good and holy men meet with from the men of the World, is from this, that <hi>grace</hi> carrieth out the Saint beyond the <hi>meaſures of the man of reaſon:</hi> So that in ſome acts, eſpecially of Religion, he cannot be bounded by his limits. The man of the World commendeth the Child of God, for his juſtice, and Charity, for his Sobriety, and temperance, his readineſs to forgive his Enemies, his meekneſs, humility, his ſerving of God, &amp;c. He is only angry at him, that he will offer up to God more and more excellent Sacrifices, that his meaſures of <hi>praying, hearing, faſting,</hi> &amp;c. Will not ſerve his turn, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Laſtly <hi>Grace is of a nimble, active nature.</hi> It is the Fire with which the Holy Ghoſt baptizeth the Soul, and it cannot lye hid in the Soul.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is <hi>from the Ordination of God that grace ſendeth forth its ſmell.</hi> We may ſay this of every created <hi>Quality,</hi> which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth any effect. It is from the Law of God in creation laid upon that Plant, Gum or Oil, known to the <hi>Eaſtern People,</hi> by this name of <hi>Spikenard,</hi> and the Law of God laid upon <hi>Musk,</hi> and ſweet Flowers amongſt us, that they or any of them, ſend forth a pleaſant ſmell, the powerful hand of God in creation hath crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſuch vertues, and qualities in theſe things, and God hath ordained that they ſhould <hi>emit, or ſend forth their ſavour;</hi> and there is a daily influence of the <hi>providence of God</hi> upon them, by which theſe natural powers, and faculties in them are upheld, by which they do produce theſe grateful effects to our ſenſes, and daily affect the Air which we ſuck in, by which that grateful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is conveyed to us: The like may be ſaid of <hi>grace</hi> which is but a <hi>ſavoury, ſweet ſmelling quality</hi> in the <hi>rational creature,</hi> cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent to the other ſavory, ſweet ſmelling qualities in <hi>vegetative</hi> and <hi>ſenſitive creatures:</hi> It is Gods creation in the Soul, and it is from <hi>Gods Ordination,</hi> that it ſendeth forth this <hi>ſmell.</hi>
                  <pb n="755" facs="tcp:61084:382"/>
This is true, whether by the <hi>Sending forth the ſmell thereof,</hi> we underſtand the <hi>exerciſe thereof;</hi> Or the <hi>gratifying the Spiritual ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of others by ſuch exerciſe:</hi> Both of them do proceed from the Ordination of God, which is the Law of God upon the New creature.</p>
               <p>There is a double Ordination of God in the caſe. The <hi>exerciſe</hi> of a believers grace is from a divine <hi>Ordination, Joh.</hi> 15. 16. <hi>You have not choſen me, but I have choſen you, and obtained you, that you ſhould go and bring forth fruit.</hi> We are choſen in him before the foundation of the World, that we ſhould be holy, and without blame before him in love, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 4. <hi>Predeſtinated</hi> to <hi>be to the praiſe of his glory, v.</hi> 11. He hath alſo <hi>ordained</hi> the acceptableneſs of the ſavour of grace, both in his own noſtrils, and in the noſtrils of others, thoſe eſpecially, that are made partakers of the divine nature, And from hence it is that <hi>grace,</hi> and the actings and exerciſes of it, ſend forth a <hi>ſweet ſmell</hi> to ſome: And others revile them, and ſpeak ill of them. As it is in natural things, ſavours which are to ſome exceedingly grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and delicious, are to other creatures as ingrateful and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable, which proceedeth from a different nature or different qualities in ſeveral creatures; all which are <hi>Originated</hi> in the <hi>Creation</hi> and Ordination of God: So it is with <hi>grace,</hi> the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of which is a ſweet ſmelling ſavour in the noſtrils of God, <hi>let me hear thy voice</hi> (ſaith the beloved in this ſong) <hi>for thy voice is ſweet,</hi> and <hi>thy countenance is comely,</hi> and a <hi>ſweet ſmelling ſavour,</hi> in the noſtrils of ſuch as are made partakers of the ſame <hi>divine nature:</hi> It is a <hi>ſtench</hi> in the noſtrils of <hi>debaucht</hi> and <hi>profane</hi> men, and the lively and <hi>vigorous exerciſe</hi> of it is ſo in the <hi>noſtrils of Hypocrites;</hi> all this proceeds from their different nature and the <hi>Ordination of God,</hi> whoſe <hi>Ordination</hi> it is, <hi>That wiſdom ſhould be juſtified of her Children.</hi> God hath <hi>ordained</hi> that where habits of grace are, they ſhould ſprout forth in acts; there is a Principle of life in the ſeed of God, as in natural ſeeds, which being committed to a fitting ſoil ſheweth it ſelf. Nor is this without the concurrence of a daily providence of God, upholding this Spiritual, vertue.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Uſe 1.</note> Let us then obſerve, that <hi>true grace is neither a dead and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipid thing, nor yet an ingrateful thing in its exerciſe, to any that have any acquaintance with God, or fellowſhip in the divine nature.</hi> The name of <hi>grace</hi> is an excellent name and every one would
<pb n="756" facs="tcp:61084:383"/>
be called by it. Amongſt Chriſtians the name of an <hi>ungracious man</hi> is a name of ſuch <hi>reproach,</hi> as every one is offended at. But alas! How dead, and inſipid a thing muſt <hi>grace</hi> be, if all had it who would pretend to it, in the age wherein God hath caſt our lot?

The moſt of men and women ſend from their converſations ſome ſcent, ſome ſmell abroad in the World, but alas! The ſmell of the moſt is not like the <hi>ſmell of a field</hi> of a Soul <hi>that the Lord hath bleſſed,</hi> with the bleſſing of his grace, but <hi>like the ſmell of Souls</hi> which the Lord hath curſed, and will curſe. One man ſmells of <hi>drunkenneſs,</hi> another <hi>ſmells of the luſts of uncleanneſs,</hi> a third ſmells of <hi>covetouſneſs,</hi> a fourth of <hi>Pride</hi> and haughtineſs of mind, a <hi>Fifth</hi> of <hi>earthly mindedneſs, and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs,</hi> a Sixth of <hi>Levity</hi> and <hi>airineſs.</hi> Another <hi>ſmells</hi> of <hi>cruelty</hi> and unmercifulneſs, another of <hi>lyes</hi> and <hi>perjuries,</hi> breaking all oaths, covenants, promiſes, &amp;c.

I <hi>hate,</hi> I <hi>deſpiſe your feaſt dayes, and I will not ſmell in your ſolemn aſſemblies. Though you offer me your burnt offerings, and your meat offerings I will not accept them, neither will I regard the peace offerings of your ſat beaſts.</hi> There are ſome whoſe ſmells are ſuch in the noſtrils of God, with reſpect to their ordinary converſation, that nothing they do, or can do, will ſmell ſweet in Gods noſtrils. As ſome ill Savours are ſo ſtrong as they drown the ſweet ſmell of any perfumes which the Perſon hath about him. So ſome ſinners ſmell ſo odiouſly, ſo abominably in the noſtrils of God, that no good act they can do, is or can be acceptable to God; this was the caſe of theſe <hi>Iſraelites:</hi> They did ſome good things, the keeping of ſolemn feaſts, the offering, of burnt offerings were things which God had commanded, and elſe where he calleth them a <hi>ſweet ſavour.</hi> But ſuch was the ſtench, the ill ſavour

of the lives of theſe degenerated <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that it had drowned the <hi>ſweet ſmell</hi> in Gods noſtrils which theſe acts had ſent forth, had they been done by better men.

                  <hi>5. I ſhall conclude this Diſcourſe with a</hi> word of Exhortation; To do what in us lies that our Spikenard may ſend forth the ſmell thereof. <hi>It amounteth to that of our Saviour,</hi> Let your Light ſo ſhine before men, that they may ſee your good works, and glorifie your Father which is in Heaven. <hi>I ſhall preſs it with two Arguments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> It is no Spikenard that ſendeth forth no ſmell, no pleaſant ſmell. James <hi>tells us, that</hi> Faith without works is dead, <hi>that is, it is no true Faith.</hi> John <hi>calleth pretended</hi> love to God <hi>without</hi> love to the Brethren, <hi>no love.</hi> Tantum es, quantum agis, <hi>a man is ſo much, and no more a Chriſtian than he acts, and liveth like a Chriſtian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. There is nothing ſo <hi>ſcandalous in the World, ſo diſhonourable to God, ſo dangerous and infignificant to our ſelves, as the name of Saints, without the ſmell of Saints.</hi> The World expects that things and perſons ſhould in ſome meaſure anſwer their names; hence it is that the falls and ſlips of Chriſtians make a greater noiſe, and give a greater offence to the World, than the groſſer actions of perſons who make no pretences to Religion and Godlineſs. For Branches in Chriſt, which bring forth no fruit, Chriſt tells us, the <hi>Husbandman,</hi> his Father will cut them off. Theſe are they who bring up an evil report upon the waies of God, and make them to be abhorred. Nor can an empty name be of any ſignificancy to our ſelves.</p>
               <p>I ſhall ſhut up this Diſcourſe with a few Directions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Would you have your Spikenard ſend forth the <hi>ſmell thereof? Take heed then of Dead Flies.</hi> The Wiſe man tells us, That one Dead Fly will make the Apothecary's whole Box of Ointment to ſtink. What are Dead Flies in this caſe but <hi>ſcandalous ſips,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from our extravagant luſts and paſſions? One open ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<pb n="760" facs="tcp:61084:385"/>
ſin, will make a Chriſtian's whole <hi>Box of Spikenard</hi> caſt forth an unpleaſant ſmell in the World. One ſinful act will not loſe us Heaven, but it will in a great meaſure ſpoil our ſcent. How many have we known, who, I hope, are gone to Heaven, who yet by their ſcandalous actions, (like <hi>David)</hi> made the Enemies of God to blaſpheme. I hope they are ſome of them gone with <hi>Spikenard,</hi> I mean, with a truth of grace to their graves, but their Spikenard had wofully loſt its ſcent. It's a ſad thing when a man, of whom we can hardly preſume, that he was in favour with God, and in a ſtate of Grace, yet leaves the World, with a better report for juſtice and charity, for mercy, and bounty, and liberality, than one who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed higher, and went for a Child of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Take heed of <hi>expoſing thy converſation to too much Air</hi> (I ſpeak in this Dialect, to keep to the <hi>Metaphor</hi> a little.) Too much of Air ſpoileth the ſcent of the moſt precious Ointment. Take heed of too much needleſs converſe with the World. Things that keep their ſcent muſt be kept cloſe. It is true at all times, much more in ſuch debauched times as we live in, the more recluſe and private from the World a Chriſtian keepeth himſelf, the better he will keep his ſcent.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Keep thy ſelf from actions, as to which, though thou art ſatisfied thou mayeſt do them, but they are not of good report,</hi> either amongſt Chriſtians, or men of the World. It is too much the Errour of Chriſtians, that in matters of <hi>offence and ſcandal,</hi> they only have a reſpect to <hi>Brethren.</hi> It is true, we ought to have a firſt and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal reſpect to them; I am ſure our Rule is more extenſive, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 32. <hi>Give none offence, either to the Jews or Gentiles, or to the Churches of Chriſt.</hi> The Apoſtle puts the Churches of Chriſt laſt, as if it ought to be the leaſt of our care not to offend the <hi>Churches of Chriſt.</hi> I know no ſuch thing can be concluded from the order of the Apoſtle's words: Yet one would think, if in actions of this nature any might be neglected, it ſhould be Believers, whom we might preſume to be of more knowledge and judgment, than to take any ſuch offences; and if they did, ſo as they ſhould reprove us for it, yet to have more love for God, than for any ſuch actions in any perſons to cauſe Religion, and the holy Name of God to be evil ſpoken of, our great care ſhould be to have a good report of thoſe <hi>who are without,</hi> and Chriſtians careleſneſs as to this, is without doubt their great Errour, we ought not only to follow things that are <hi>juſt, and honeſt, and pure,</hi> but things alſo that are <hi>lovely,</hi> and
<pb n="761" facs="tcp:61084:385"/>
of a <hi>good report, Phil.</hi> 4. 8. and <hi>to provide things honeſt in the ſight of all men, Rom.</hi> 12. 17.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>You muſt live in the practice and exerciſe of Grace, if you will have it ſend forth the ſmell thereof.</hi> It is the rubbed Pomander that is <hi>ſweet. The Ointment poured out,</hi> which ſendeth out a ſavour. It is not <hi>Grace</hi> talked of, but acted, and in its full exerciſe that ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth its pleaſant ſmell.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Laſtly; <hi>Be as much in communion with Chriſt as thou canſt.</hi> The King muſt be at his Table, when our Spikenard ſendeth forth the ſmell thereof. Be much with him in <hi>Prayer, Meditation, Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Word.</hi> The Preaching of the Goſpel is the <hi>feaſt of fat things</hi> upon the Mountains; and here, becauſe it is a time when ſome of you are preparing for your duty of communion with Chriſt in the Ordinance of his Supper, let me mind you of your duty as to that, the rather, becauſe I find our own Annotators, and divers other Expoſitors of my Text touching upon it in their Notes. That <hi>Table</hi> is the <hi>King's Table:</hi> It is called the <hi>Lord's Table,</hi> he is the Maſter of that Feaſt, as well as the Proviſion. It is an Ordinance which the Lord hath inſtituted for our Soul's fellowſhip and communion with him; Our Souls draw out from the Fountain of his Fulneſs, by this Conduit-pipe. <hi>Neglect not that ſacred Ordinance,</hi> that your <hi>Spike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> may ſend forth the ſmell thereof; And <hi>Remember while you ſit there, that you do not reſtrain your Souls from God,</hi> but give out your Souls in the exerciſe of the graces of <hi>Faith, Love, Repentance, Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving</hi> proper for that holy communion with this <hi>King of Glory.</hi>

               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1. That</hi> all exerciſe of gracious habits dependeth upon Chriſts influence upon, and communion with, the Soul.</p>

                  </gap> and 1 <hi>Phil.</hi> 29. <hi>It is given to you on the behalf of Chriſt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,</hi> a <hi>power</hi> to <hi>believe,</hi> that is the <hi>habit,</hi> but the Lord doth not only give us a <hi>power to believe,</hi> but to believe <hi>actually. Acts</hi> of faith, and holineſs, are our <hi>fruit;</hi> The <hi>habits</hi> of either are <hi>the ſeed,</hi> the Acts are the fruit, and ſo are often called in holy writ, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 2, 3, 4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 4. <hi>In me</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>is thy fruit found;</hi> hence a life of Holineſs is called a <hi>walking</hi> in, and <hi>after the Spirit, Gal.</hi> 5. 25. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1. <hi>I live</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Galat.</hi> 2. 20.) <hi>but yet not</hi> I, but <hi>Chriſt liveth in me;</hi> and again Phil. 4. <hi>v.</hi> 13. <hi>I can do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengthneth me.</hi> To every good <hi>act</hi> there is not required only a <hi>firſt exciting grace,</hi> and a <hi>working grace,</hi> quickening, and determining the will unto the act: But a further <hi>exciting, aſſiſting,</hi> and <hi>cooperating grace,</hi> Thus that ancient Councel <hi>(Concil.

                  <hi>sn us and with us that we may work.</hi> Hence the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith, of himſelf, 1 Cor. 15. 10. <hi>By the grace of God I am that I am, and his grace which was beſtowed on me was not in vain, but I la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured more abundantly then they all, yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.</hi> In every good action of a regenerate Soul The renewed Soul acts, and God acts.

Some (ſaith he) may ſay, <hi>Then holy men are acted, and do not act; Reſpondeo</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Immo agis, &amp; ageris &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="1">1. The <hi>firſt is the difference between Gods influence upon our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral powers to their natural acts and our Spiritual habits &amp; powers as to their Spiritual acts.</hi> God influenceth our bodily members, as to their <hi>natural acts.</hi> Without his influence we could not <hi>move,</hi> nor <hi>ſpeak,</hi> nor do any natural act; but how doth he influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence us as to them? By <hi>upholding</hi> our <hi>natural powers:</hi> And by <hi>keeping off thoſe things which would hinder their natural exerciſes.</hi> God hath given unto man a Soul, indued with the powers both of the <hi>Vegetative Soul</hi> in plants, and of the <hi>Senſitive Soul</hi> in brute creatures, beſides ſome more noble powers, which are proper to the reaſonable Soul. Now theſe Souls act from this <hi>natural power</hi> in them, which being upheld in them, &amp; not hindred by any <hi>forraign,</hi> or <hi>intrinſick</hi> cauſe, produce the acts that are proper to them: This is but an influence of <hi>common providence,</hi> and is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all men. But the influence I am ſpeaking of is an influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of <hi>Special grace:</hi> Not an influence common to men, but pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to the People of God who have experienced this grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Second difference I deſire you to obſerve is, <hi>The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt Divine influences, as to the firſt and this further grace.</hi> No man cometh unto the Son <hi>unleſs the Father draweth him.</hi> In the firſt grace the Soul is <hi>meerly paſſive;</hi> that change is wrought by <hi>working grace;</hi> this by <hi>cooperative,</hi> and <hi>aſſiſting grace;</hi> the renewed Soul moves and acts from it ſelf: It is only <hi>quickened</hi> and <hi>aſſiſted</hi> by Divine influences. To ſpeak therefore clearly, and diſtinctly, we ſay God hath a double influence upon our wills as to any good actions done by us.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="764" facs="tcp:61084:387"/>
1. He influenceth <hi>our wills as the cauſe, Exciting our wills to the Acts.</hi> Our wills are the cauſe of all good actions done by us, (the proximate cauſe;) we firſt <hi>will</hi> the thing which we do, <hi>ſed ille fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit ut velimus,</hi> it is he who influenceth our wills, and makes us willing, and then excites our wills.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>God together with our wills</hi> (as the proximate cauſe) <hi>hath an influence upon the effect.</hi> It is univerſally granted by ſober men, That there is a concurſe of Divine providence, to the production of every <hi>effect;</hi> nor doth this concurſe of the <hi>firſt cauſe</hi> hinder the <hi>liberty of the Second Cauſe.</hi> No Natural agent produceth any effect without a <hi>concurſe of the Divine power,</hi> and a ſimultaneous motion of the Divine power. Some will have this influence of God upon us, as to Spiritual acts, to be no more then an ordinary concurrence of Providence. But I think the contrary will appear to every one who ſhall diligently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The imperfect ſtate of the will of man even after regeneration.</hi> Before Regeneration man hath <hi>ſervum arbitriun:</hi> A meer ſervile will. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> tells us that in the <hi>ſtate of Innocency,</hi> mans happineſs lay in a <hi>poſſe non peccare,</hi> a power which he had in that ſtate, if he would, not to ſin againſt God. The happineſs of the ſtate of the Souls in glory will lie in a <hi>non poſſe peccare,</hi> in this that they ſhall have no power more to ſin. They ſhall be like the Angels in Heaven, confirmed in a ſtate of purity, and holineſs. The ſtate of a Man or Woman not regenerated is <hi>that he cannot but ſin.</hi> Now though the Regeneratedman be by regeneration freed from the <hi>ſervitude</hi> of the laſt mentioned ſtate, yet it is much ſhort either of the more perfect ſtate of the <hi>will of the glorified Saints,</hi> or of the ſtate of <hi>Adam in inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,</hi> we cannot ſay that their will is ſo ſtated through Grace, <hi>that they have a power not to ſin.</hi> Even the beſt of men ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth 7 times a day, and who can tell how oft he offendeth. We know but in part, and ſo may ſin through ignorance, and oft times do ſo. We are men full of <hi>paſſions,</hi> and live in a World that is full of temptations, and are often <hi>over-born.</hi> Our will is indeed manumiſed, and <hi>to will is preſent with</hi> us, but our free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is imperfect.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Yea I cannot underſtand, but that we ſhould have need of a Divine influence exciting, and aſſiſting us to our <hi>Spiritual acts,</hi> ſuppoſing that upon our regeneration we had been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly

reſtored unto that <hi>indifferency</hi> in which <hi>Adam</hi> was created. For admit the <hi>will of man indifferently free to move</hi> to good or evil, what but the Influence of <hi>Divine Grace</hi> ſhould incline and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine it rather to that which is good, than to that which is evil. But that which makes it much ſtronger, is the conſideration that we are not reſtored to ſuch a perfect liberty or indifferency, but there is remaining even in the beſt the <hi>body of death, paſſions,</hi> impetuous paſſions, which ſtrongly Incline us to that which is evil, and often prevail againſt us. <hi>David</hi> complaineth, <hi>That iniquities prevailed againſt him. Paul</hi> complained, <hi>That he was ſometimes brought into captivity to the Law of his Members.</hi> Beſides, if we could imagine that the <hi>will of man</hi> (though renewed) could be the <hi>firſt Principle</hi> of any ſpiritual action, it muſt be a Firſt Cauſe, and man would be a God to himſelf.</p>
               <p>But it may be ſome will ſay, though it be true, that the <hi>will of man</hi> cannot move it ſelf to a <hi>Spiritual Act,</hi> but it muſt have a firſt mover, yet God's Influence upon it may be no more than the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary concurſe of his Providence, ſuch as he allows to all his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures upholding their Beings, and their natural powers and facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. I therefore add,</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>That this may ſeem plauſible to thoſe who either do not conſider, or will not allow thoſe two contrary Principles which are in every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed Soul,</hi> but to thoſe who believe and conſider this, it cannot, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>For the Fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit againſt the Fleſh, and theſe are contrary the one to the other, ſo that you cannot do the things which you would;</hi> eſpecially when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider alſo the advantage which the <hi>Fleſh</hi> hath in us againſt the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Vicious habits and inclinations are natural to the ſoil of our hearts. It is a common obſervation, <hi>Quod ſponte prodit laetius pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,</hi> what a ſoil naturally brings forth, it brings forth more vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly and certainly, than what it is made to bring forth by Art and Cultivation. The heart of every man naturally inclines to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and actions, contrary to the Will of God. Hence <hi>Self-denial</hi> is the firſt thing neceſſary to Chriſt's Diſciple; this makes more than a concurſe of common Providence neceſſary to a ſpiritual act. Now in our <hi>natural motions</hi> there is no oppoſition, and therefore an ordinary conſervative power of common Providence is ſufficient to their production, Nature giving no oppoſition to them; but this reaſon differeth very little from the firſt, therefore I ſhall not further inlarge upon this head.</p>

4. Laſtly; If we could exerciſe gracious habits without any <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural influence</hi> exciting and quickening, and alſo aſſiſting and cooperating; <hi>Then we might from our ſelves begin, and carry on a ſupernatural act:</hi> For ſuppoſe one indued with the habits of grace, he is only by theſe furniſhed with a power to believe, to love God, &amp;c. The Queſtion is, <hi>Whence he acts and exerciſeth theſe powers?</hi> If this be from <hi>himſelf,</hi> then the <hi>ſupernatural act begins,</hi> and is carried on from himſelf, and God ſhould give only to <hi>will,</hi> but <hi>not to do.</hi> The Apoſtle tells us, in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>That we are not ſufficient of our ſelves to think any thing as of our ſelves, but our ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency is from God.</hi> If it be anſwered, That as in natural actions God upholdeth the natural powers and faculties of the Soul; ſo in the renewed Nature, he upholdeth the <hi>Spiritual Powers.</hi> This is too ſhort; for the Queſtion is, Whence a Chriſtian is inclined to this or that individual good action, and why more at one time than another; for there is a never-ceaſing influence of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the principles and powers of the renewed Nature; yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience tells us there is not at all times the ſame <hi>power</hi> and <hi>vigour</hi> to act. Beſides, in all God's influences and concurſes of <hi>Providence</hi> with his creatures, his influence is according to the nature of the ſecond Cauſe with which he concurreth. But when God concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth with a <hi>ſpiritual habit</hi> or power in the Soul, he concurreth with a <hi>Second Cauſe</hi> which is <hi>ſupernatural,</hi> not a native quality in the rational Soul, but <hi>adventitious, ſuperinduced qualities,</hi> therefore an ordinary concurſe of Providence is not ſufficient; and as the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Cauſe with which he concurreth is ſupernatural, ſo the Effect to be produced is of that nature alſo. To all this might be added, the mention ſo often made in Scripture of the <hi>Spirit dwelling in us, helping our infirmities, working in us:</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s telling us, that he <hi>lived,</hi> yet not he, but ſaith he, <hi>Chriſt liveth in me, Gal.</hi> 2. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Degrees of exerciſes of Grace depend upon the degrees of thoſe Influences.</hi> Chriſt tells us, That he came into the World, <hi>that his People might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly, Joh.</hi> 10. 10. The aboundings of gracious acts depend upon the aboundings of Spiritual Life. This is ſo obvious to every man's common reaſon, that I need not inlarge in a Diſcourſe to prove it. Every one will conclude, That if without Chriſt <hi>we can do nothing,</hi> we cannot without him do great things, if we cannot think a <hi>good thought,</hi> we cannot <hi>pray a good prayer,</hi> nor do an act which muſt ſpeak a great ſelf-denial, and mortification of our members.</p>
               <p n="3">3.<note place="margin">3 Concluſ.</note> 
                  <hi>As is the exerciſe of Grace, ſo is the ſmell of it.</hi> I have before told you, that ſome Divines ſay, the <hi>exerciſe of Grace</hi> is the <hi>ſmell of it.</hi> I had rather by it underſtand the <hi>Acceptation</hi> of ſuch exerciſe of Grace with God, and the <hi>report of it</hi> amongſt men, which indeed dependeth upon the exerciſe, and is more or leſs according to the exerciſe of it. The more a Soul liveth in the improvement and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of thoſe bleſſed habits with which God hath endued it, the more it glorifieth God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 8. <hi>Herein is my Father glorified, that you bear much fruit; ſo ſhall you be my Diſciples. Abraham</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>ſtrong in the Faith, gave glory to God;</hi> and the greater is the ſweet ſavour which the Soul gives in the World. There is nothing in the exerciſe of gracious habits, that is unlovely, or unſavoury to that part of the World, that hath not through malice out-lawed its reaſon; they are not the exerciſes of Grace, but the breakings out of ſin and corruption which give the Souls of Chriſtians any ill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port amongſt the generality of the men of the World. Some few perſons indeed there are, who have ſuch a perfect rooted hatred of God in them, that as they ſay of the <hi>Baſilisk,</hi> that it hath ſuch an hatred and antipathy to man, that it will flie upon the Picture of a man; ſo they will flie upon the Image of God where-ever they ſee it, or think they ſee it; but the number of theſe (though in it ſelf too great, yet) comparatively is but ſmall. The generality of men and women in the World are not ſo bad, but a good man living uniformly up to his Principles, hath a fairer quarter amongſt them. But amongſt the People of God, thoſe who excel in vertue, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of Grace alwaies ſmell very ſweet, and amongſt all men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the conduct of reaſon; as is the exerciſe of theſe ſpiritual habits, ſo is the Chriſtian's <hi>ſmell</hi> more or leſs. The Ointment poured forth
<pb n="768" facs="tcp:61084:389"/>
is that which perfumes the houſe, the reaſon is, becauſe that odo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riferous quality is by the Air, (as its <hi>vehicle) conveyed to our ſenſes.</hi> So for men and women in the World; the habits of Grace in the Soul are not diſcerned but by the exerciſe. Indeed as to our <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation with God,</hi> the reaſon is different; he ſeeth the hearts of men in their internal change and renovation, but he hath given them their gracious habits for this very end, that they ſhould exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe them; he hath commanded the exerciſe of them; <hi>Let me hear thy voice</hi> (ſaith he) for <hi>ſweet is thy voice.</hi> By the exerciſe of them he is glorified; a great deal of honour redoundeth to him from others. So as it muſt needs be true, that as is the <hi>exerciſe of Grace,</hi> ſo muſt be the <hi>ſmell</hi> thereof, whether you by <hi>ſmell</hi> underſtand <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe</hi> (as the ſmell of the odoriferous Ointment or Plant is the product of its odoriferous quality) or the <hi>acceptation</hi> of it with God, and acceptableneſs of it unto man. Where there is no exerciſe of Grace, there can be no <hi>ſmell;</hi> where the exerciſe of it is weak, the ſmell of it muſt bear a proportion; where there are the higheſt and ſtrongeſt exerciſes, there is the ſweeteſt and ſtrongeſt ſmell.</p>
               <p n="4">4.<note place="margin">4 Concluſ.</note> 
                  <hi>Where the King is withdrawn from his Table, the Soul's Spike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard ſendeth forth little or no ſmell.</hi> This is my laſt Concluſion, in proof of the Propoſition. God ſometimes hideth himſelf from the Souls of his People. The preſence of God with Churches, Nations, and particular Souls (of which you ſo often read in holy Writ) is to be underſtood not of his <hi>Eſſential Preſence,</hi> for ſo he is never ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from any of us; <hi>Enter, praeſenter Deus eſt, &amp; ubique potenter</hi> (according to the old barbarous verſe) he <hi>filleth Heaven and Earth, &amp; infinitum ultrà ſpatium,</hi> an infinite ſpace beyond what we can comprehend under theſe two terms. It muſt be therefore underſtood of his <hi>Providential Preſence</hi> reſpecting his <hi>goodneſs,</hi> and ſuch grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diſpenſations as from thence flow to poor creatures. Now the goodneſs of God reſpecting our outward or inward man, God is ſaid to be <hi>preſent</hi> or abſent, with or from his creatures, as he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſeth out good unto them, or with-holdeth them from them. Hence you read in Scripture ſo often of God's preſence with his People in going out with their Armies, bleſſing them with ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, &amp;c. And on the contrary, of God's hiding his face, and depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures from his People, by his giving them up to their Enemies, his cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them in their baskets and ſtore, &amp;c. As to their <hi>inward man,</hi> God is ſaid to be <hi>preſent with them</hi> when he upholdeth their Souls to their ſpiritual operations, gives them quiet, and peace in their
<pb n="769" facs="tcp:61084:389"/>
Spirits, &amp;c. to be abſent, and to hide his face from them when he with-holdeth theſe Influences. God indeed doth never wholly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake a <hi>living man,</hi> for he muſt then die and return to his duſt; nor as to his <hi>Spiritual Influences</hi> doth he ever wholly <hi>withdraw himſelf</hi> from the Believer's Soul, for then his <hi>Spiritual Life</hi> muſt be wholly extinguiſhed, the <hi>Union</hi> betwixt the <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his <hi>Spirit</hi> wholly diſſolved, but he oftentimes doth gradually withdraw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; this is what we call <hi>Deſertion.</hi> Take a Soul under theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances which enjoyeth not the preſence of Chriſt with it as at other times, this Soul at this time <hi>hath its Spikenard,</hi> for the Seed of God abideth in it; but (alas!) <hi>it ſendeth not forth the ſmell thereof,</hi> at leaſt not ſo as at other times; the <hi>deſerted Soul</hi> acts its Grace weakly, falls under many corruptions, and into many temptations: It is like a Flower in Winter, whoſe Root is kept in the Earth alive, but it doth not bud and bloſſom as at other times. It is true, God at ſuch a time loveth the Soul, (for whom he loveth, he loveth to the end, but many of its actions in this ſtate are not ſo pleaſing to him; it crieth out, I think upon him, and I am troubled; I am ſo troubled, that I cannot ſpeak, I cannot pray, I cannot ſing prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, &amp;c. Nor can its converſation be ſo ſweet to men; it walks <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectedly,</hi> and troubled, &amp;c. It is true, Deſertions are of ſeveral ſorts and degrees, and that Soul from whom God hideth himſelf as to conſolatory Influences, may yet enjoy his preſence as to <hi>ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>quickening Influences,</hi> but the actions of a <hi>deſerted Soul,</hi> ſo far as it is <hi>deſerted,</hi> are far from ſending forth a pleaſant ſmell. Theſe four things are ſufficient to make good the Propoſition. <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>preſence</hi> of Chriſt with, and his ſupernatural Influences upon the Soul, are highly neceſſary to the Spouſe's Spikenard ſending forth the ſmell thereof. I come now to the Application.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Uſe 1.</note> Obſerve from hence (in the firſt place) <hi>how little room is left for any creature's boaſting, and how juſt reaſon the beſt of Souls have to walk humbly before their God.</hi> We are naturally <hi>proud,</hi> and have hearts exceedingly prone to be lifted up above meaſure. God knoweth our <hi>infirmity,</hi> and hath ſo ordered the whole buſineſs of our Salvation, that all <hi>boaſting is excluded.</hi> There are but two things as to our <hi>Spiritual concerns</hi> that we can boaſt or glory in: The <hi>dignity of our ſtate,</hi> or <hi>the change of our hearts</hi> manifeſted in our <hi>holy diſpoſitions,</hi> or <hi>vertuous and pious actions.</hi> As to the former God hath (as the Apoſtle hath determined) <hi>excluded boaſting,</hi> by <hi>the Law of Faith, Rom.</hi> 3. 27. <hi>Where is boaſting then?</hi> (ſaith he)
<pb n="770" facs="tcp:61084:390"/>
he anſwereth himſelf, <hi>It is excluded; By what Law? Of Works? nay, but by the Law of Faith.</hi> Would any man glory that his Soul is in a ſtate of righteouſneſs, and favour with God? What reaſon is there for that, if he be juſtified through Grace, and righteous only through the imputed righteouſneſs of another? If he be only compleat in Chriſt, all glorying of that Nature is excluded. What is then left for a man to glory in, will he glory in his <hi>habits of grace,</hi> the <hi>renovation of his nature,</hi> &amp;c. So indeed he might if this change had proceeded from himſelf, if he had been born again of the <hi>will of man,</hi> or of <hi>bloods,</hi> but if it be <hi>of the will of God,</hi> if it be of <hi>water, and</hi> of <hi>the Spirit,</hi> which worketh as a moſt free agent, blowing where it liſteth, where is there any room for boaſting? Will he boaſt of his <hi>good acts?</hi> If it be not he that liveth, but Chriſt that liveth in him, if all things which he doth be through Chriſt that ſtrengtheneth him, where is there any room for boaſting? God hath not left us a Feather to boaſt of: Will a man boaſt that he hath a power to will what is ſpiritually good? He boaſts beyond his Line, and of a Lye. For it is God who giveth <hi>both to will and to do.</hi> This is <hi>gratia operans,</hi> working Grace; it is working, effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Grace that giveth man any ſpiritual power; he cannot make his own <hi>Spikenard;</hi> it is indeed his, but <hi>ex dono,</hi> of God's free gift: But it may be when he hath it, <hi>he can exerciſe it without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aſſiſtance;</hi> no, as he muſt firſt <hi>receive the Spirit</hi> before he hath in him any thing of Spiritual Life, ſo he muſt be <hi>led by the Spirit.</hi> If God did not excite the Grace beſtowed on him, it would be choaked by that body of death, that luſt and corruption which is in the beſt mens hearts. What can the creature do, when the Holy Spirit hath quickened his habits of Grace? he cannot act and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe them, and put forth ſpiritual acts; but doth he no more need the Influence of the Holy Spirit? yes, without Chriſt he can do nothing; he muſt ſtill have the Grace of God with him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 10. <hi>Not I</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) but the Grace of God which was with me.</hi> This is now <hi>cooperative</hi> and <hi>aſſiſting Grace.</hi> He cannot make the Wheel which muſt carry him in the waies of God, <hi>(working Grace</hi> muſt do that) when it is made, he cannot ſet it upon motion. <hi>Exciting Grace</hi> muſt oil it; <hi>Aſſiſting Grace</hi> muſt keep it up, move with it, or he will never come to iſſue any good action. A Believer indeed <hi>acteth,</hi> for the <hi>habits of Grace</hi> from which he acteth are <hi>inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent</hi> in him; he is not moved like a <hi>Machine,</hi> or dead Engine, but yet he is acted, that is, aſſiſted and helped in his action: He is <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi>
                  <pb n="771" facs="tcp:61084:390"/>
but <hi>what he hath received;</hi> he <hi>doth nothing</hi> but <hi>while he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving.</hi> Let not then the Natural man glory in the power and good inclinations of his own will; he neither hath, nor can have any power to do that which in a ſpiritual ſenſe is good, until it be given him from above. Let not the <hi>renewed man glory in his infuſed habits of Grace;</hi> for as he did not <hi>merit it,</hi> nor any way purchaſe them, ſo of himſelf he cannot <hi>uſe or exerciſe them:</hi> But let him who <hi>glorieth,</hi> glory in this, that to him <hi>Chriſt is all in all,</hi> that he <hi>liveth,</hi> he acteth, and bringeth a good action to an iſſue, but yet <hi>not he,</hi> but Chriſt that <hi>liveth</hi> in him, acteth with him, and worketh in him what he accepteth from him. It is Chriſt who layeth the foundation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, and then layeth the corner-ſtone, who is both the <hi>Author and Finiſher of our Faith;</hi> we have nothing to do but to cry <hi>Grace, Grace,</hi> when we ſee the work done. In the mean time, nothing hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth but that the Soul may rejoyce, and boaſt in the Lord, while it walketh humbly with God, mourning over the infirmity of its lapſed Nature; for certainly man did not come out of God's hands in the day of Creation in this impotent ſtate.

               <p n="1">1. I ſay firſt <hi>in point of duty,</hi> as God is thereby glorifyed. For this cauſe we are born, for this cauſe is every man come into the World, that he may bring honour and glory to his great Creator. Herein (ſaith our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 15.) <hi>Is my Father glorifyed, if you bring forth mach fruit,</hi> and as the Lord

               <p n="3">3.

               <p>I anſwer, It is true, that our God (as to his <hi>manifeſtative</hi> preſence with the Souls of his People) governeth himſelf accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the good pleaſure of his will, and his own infinite, and unſearchable wiſdom: The King oft-times riſeth up from his Table when the Soul of his Child is able to give it ſelf no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count what diſtaſte he hath taken, nor what hath made him to go away from it, and not to give out his influence as at other times, but yet it is as true that at other times, he withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for the puniſhment of his Peoples ſins, either of <hi>Omiſſion</hi> or <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> and there are ſome means to be uſed in order to the keeping of his preſence with us, upon the Omiſſion, or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of which he withdraweth, and hideth his face, and he ordinarily departech not from the Soul but upon ſome diſtaſt given to him; I ſhall therefore conclude this diſcourſe, with a few <hi>directions</hi> given in order to the keeping ofhis preſence with us. To keep to the <hi>Metaphor</hi> here uſed, there are four or five things, which will make a ſerious and ingenuous Perſon make haſt from a Table, or depart from a place, where he might have made a longer ſtay, or abode. 1. The frowardneſs or ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of his hoſt, 2. A diſcerned want of love or attendance, 3. An ill intertainment, 4. The dulneſs or unpleaſantneſs of the company, 5. A diſcerned ſlight or careleſneſs of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. To avoid theſe,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Take heed of grieving his holy Spirit,</hi> quenching the motions of it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 20. <hi>Behold I ſtand at the door and knock, if any man will open, I will come in, and ſup with him, and he ſhall ſup with me.</hi> O Chriſts coming in, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
<pb n="774" facs="tcp:61084:392"/>
with the Soul, and allowing the Soul to ſup with him, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies what is here in the Text expreſſed, by the <hi>Kings ſitting at his Table.</hi> And the Spouſes <hi>Spikenard, ſending forth the ſmell thereof;</hi> now this dependeth upon the Souls opening; when Chriſt ſtands at the door, and knocketh, he knocketh by the <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his holy Spirit,</hi> the Soul <hi>openeth,</hi> by <hi>its willingneſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, imbrace and obey ſuch motions;</hi> the reaſon why this great King, riſeth up from his Table, is, becauſe when he knocketh the Soul is not obedient to his motions, he <hi>pipeth</hi> to the Soul, and it doth not <hi>dance.</hi> He <hi>mourneth to it</hi> and <hi>it doth not weep,</hi> it doth not anſwer his motions to it, according to the nature of them, but denyeth, delayeth or diſputeth. God telleth the preſumptuous ſinner, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 24. That, <hi>Becauſe he hath call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> and he <hi>refuſed, becauſe he ſtretcheth out his hand, and he doth not regard, but he ſets at nought all his Counſel, and would none of his reproof, he would laugh at their calamity, and mock when their fear cometh,</hi> &amp;c. As a Child of God cannot be guilty of ſinning to ſuch a degree, as ſetting at nought all the Lords Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and refuſing all his reproof: So he cannot be under ſuch a ſevere threatning as is there mentioned. But as the Child of God may in ſome degrees be guilty of ſuch ſinning, not hearken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to, and obeying all the motions of Gods holy Spirit, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving all its reproof; So for this he may be puniſhed in his meaſure, by Gods withdrawings of his manifeſtative preſence, take therefore the Apoſtles Counſel, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 30. <hi>And grieve not the holy Spirit whereby you are ſealed unto the day of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Let this great King want no love,</hi> no <hi>attendance,</hi> no <hi>reverence</hi> nor obedience, while <hi>he ſits with you.</hi> When Chriſt was at meat in the houſe of <hi>Simon the leper, Mary</hi> brought a box of <hi>Spike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard,</hi> and poured it on his head, <hi>Mar.</hi> 14. 3. Chriſt ſits ſtill while the Ointment was poured out, it was not the ſmell of the Spikenard but the love of her that brought it, which made the room pleaſant to him.

in <hi>Cana of Galilee</hi> where Chriſt was preſent, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>Whatſoever he ſaith unto you do it.</hi> That is the way to keep him ſtill ſitting at his Table in your Soul.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Take heed there come nothing to your Table that ſhall diſtaſt him.</hi> Every ill ſmell of <hi>lnſts</hi> and corruptions will diſturb him; this made him to hate the Jewiſh <hi>feaſt days,</hi> and <hi>not to ſmell in their Solemn aſſemblies, Amos</hi> 5. 21. If you look into <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 1. 11, 12, 13. <hi>Ch.</hi> 66. <hi>v.</hi> 3. <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. 8, 9, 10. You will ſee what ſins will make him to riſe up from his Table: All for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality, and hypocrisy in your behaviour toward him, all groſs, and Scandalous ſinnings, &amp;c. When in ſtead of <hi>wine</hi> he meets with the <hi>poiſon of Dragons</hi> inſtead of <hi>ſweet grapes,</hi> he meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with <hi>grapes of gall,</hi> and <hi>cluſters of wormwood,</hi> he will not long ſit at his Table in that Soul.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Not only the apparent <hi>badneſs,</hi> and <hi>rudeneſs,</hi> but the <hi>dulneſs, and unpleaſantneſs of a company, makes an ingenuous man riſe up from his Table.</hi> Take heed of heavineſs, and dulneſs, inactivity, and want of delight in your communion with God.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> As a diſcerned careleſneſs, and ſlighting of a friends Company, makes the ſtay of an ingenuous Perſon with his friend, much ſhorter, then it otherwiſe would have been: <hi>So</hi> any careleſs ſlighty behaviour toward this great King, may make his ſtay, and abode with your Souls, <hi>in</hi> the ſenſible manifeſtations of his love, much ſhorter <hi>then</hi> it otherwiſe might have been. <hi>He will be a welcome gueſt where-ever he abideth; on the other ſide, he doth not eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly riſe up, or depart from a Table where the Soul inlargeth it ſelf in teſtifying the gratefulneſs of his preſence to it, by offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him all the entertainment it can afford him, giving up of it ſelf to him, daily importuning him not to leave him. Thus you ſhall find our Spouſe doing,</hi> Cant. <hi>3. 4.—I</hi> found him whom my Soul loveth, I held him, and would not let him go, untill <hi>I</hi> had brought him into my Mothers houſe, and into the Chamber of her that conceived me.</p>

I noted to you four things concerning <hi>Myrrh,</hi> and two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a <hi>bundle of Myrrh:</hi> I ſhall purſue them alittle, and by them give you the ſenſe of the Propoſition.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>I told you Myrrh,</hi> true <hi>Myrrh,</hi> was an <hi>exceeding ſcarce thing, and therefore very precious, and of great value;</hi> it grows but in ſome Countries, few have it, it is the beſt thing of the Country, a Preſent for a Prince. I proved this; <hi>Chriſt is of great value to a poor Soul;</hi> 1. <hi>Not eaſily procured.</hi> 2. When <hi>procured, of inflnite worth.</hi> He is the <hi>Giſt of God,</hi> and God giveth <hi>as a King.</hi> No man <hi>comes to the Son, but he whom the Father draws.</hi> In the Country where <hi>Myrrh</hi> grew, but few got it. In a <hi>Country</hi> where Chriſt is Preached, but few get a portion in him: <hi>One of a City, and two of a Tribe God brings to</hi> Sion. <hi>Judas</hi> ſate under the Myrrh-tree, and yet got no Myrrh. <hi>Many are called, but few are choſen.</hi> If they did not make their Inciſion into the Myrrh-tree, and that in a ſeaſonable time of the year too, even the inhabitants of <hi>Arabia</hi> got no Myrrh. Even thoſe that live where Chriſt is preacht, without laying hold upon him and receiving the drops of his blood, and that in a ſeaſonable time too, in the <hi>accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time</hi> (as the Holy Ghoſt terms it) <hi>while he may be ſound</hi> (as the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeaketh) they get no part in Chriſt. The <hi>fooliſh Virgins</hi> may come when the Door is ſhut: And our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſaith, <hi>Many ſhall ſeek and ſhall not enter.</hi> 2. <hi>Myrrh</hi> when procured <hi>was of high value.</hi> Eſpecially a great quantity, a <hi>bundle of Myrrh.</hi> So is <hi>Chriſt;</hi> Witneſs the Apoſtle, who counts all things droſs, and dung that he may <hi>win Chriſt,</hi> who deſires to have nothing but Chriſt, to know nothing but Chriſt to be<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 7, 8.</note> nothing but intereſted in Chriſt. Nay let the Evidence of the thing witneſs. <hi>By his name alone we can be ſaved,</hi> Acts 4. 12. By him we have <hi>remiſſion of ſins, juſtification, peace with God,</hi> indeed all ſpiritual bleſſings, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 3. He is <hi>All in all.</hi> Thus, you ſee in the firſt ſenſe he is a <hi>bundle of Myrrh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. I told you <hi>Myrrh was very medicinal,</hi> of this the Scripture ſpeaks nothing, but <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> and <hi>Pliny,</hi> and other Naturaliſts,<note place="margin">Plinii Nat. hiſt. l. <hi>24.</hi> c. <hi>26.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Myrrh</hi> is (as I told you) a <hi>great preſervative againſt putreſaction.</hi> Which was the cauſe of their uſing of it about dead bodies, either putting it into the body (after the <hi>Egyptian Method)</hi> or outwardly anointing, or embalming the body with it (after the <hi>Jewiſh Method.)</hi> Chriſt is the ſame to the Soul where he dwells, he preſerveth the Soul againſt the putrifacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of luſts and corruptions. The Apoſtle ſpeaks this, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 3.<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>How ſhall we that are dead to ſin live any longer therein.</hi> Where he argues that the Souls Intereſt in Chriſt ariſing from its juſtification, preſerveth the Soul againſt <hi>putrifying luſts,</hi> that <hi>ſin cannot have dominion over it,</hi> becauſe it is not under the law, but under grace. But I haſten to the 4th which in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Interpreters is chiefly intended here.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Myrrh, whether in the <hi>Herb, Spice, or Gum, is exceeding ſweet.</hi> Hence you read of beds, and garments <hi>perſumed with Myrrh:</hi> Now the greater quantity there is, the ſtronger the odour muſt be: Chriſt is a heap of ſweets, exceeding ſweet to<note place="margin">Cant. 5. 13, 16</note> the Soul; <hi>his mouth is moſt ſweet,</hi> Cant. 5. 16. <hi>his Cheeks are as ſweet Flowers, his lips drop ſweet ſmelling Myrrh, Cant.</hi> 5. 13. Sweetneſs to the noſtrils is nothing elſe but <hi>a ſmell that ariſing from ſome hidden quality in the thing that emits it, and conveyed to the noſtrils by the air, gratifies that outward ſenſe.</hi> There is a <hi>ſweetneſs,</hi> that is mental too. A Notion is as ſweet to the<note place="margin">Prov. 13. 19.</note> Scholar, as a perfume is to a <hi>Lady, Prov.</hi> 13. 19. <hi>Deſire ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed is ſweet to the Soul.</hi> Chriſts ſweetneſs is mental ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he is ſweetneſs not to the noſtrils, but to the Soul, and ſo he is a bundle of ſweets: Let me unty this bundle of Myrrh a little. And ſhew you how Chriſt is ſweet: I will open it to you in three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>He is exceeding ſweet in his actions as our Redeemer.</hi> As to theſe he is a bundle of Myrrh, there were many of them: His <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niting of the Divine nature to the Humane nature,</hi> in his Incarnation, <hi>his fulfilling the law,</hi> his <hi>death upon the croſs;</hi> His re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, aſcending, ſitting at his Fathers right hand, making interceſſion for us: The Soul ſmells of all theſe by <hi>Meditation and</hi>
                  <pb n="783" facs="tcp:61084:396"/>
                  <hi>faith,</hi> and the ſmell is like that of a bundle of <hi>Myrrh;</hi> ſhall I ſhew you how? 1. For his <hi>Incarnation, with the manner of it,</hi> he unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>divine, and humane nature, by an hypoſtatical union, was conceived by the overſhadowing of the Holy Ghoſt in the womb of a Virgin without the help of man.</hi> Mr. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> and others think this Text, hath a ſpecial referenee to this; this is Chriſt now conſidered, as <hi>wrapt in ſwadling clothes, and laid in a manger.</hi> The Soul ſmells of this by a firm and ſtedfaſt divine faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the thing becauſe God hath ſaid it in his word, though it cannot ſee it by the evidence of <hi>reaſon</hi> and <hi>ſenſe.</hi> And the Souls ſmells of it <hi>continually by meditation.</hi> And O how ſweet it is to a believing Soul! Then ſaith the Soul (firſt) <hi>he that San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifieth,</hi> and <hi>I that am Sanctified are both one.</hi> I ſee Chriſt is not <hi>aſhamed to call me Brother.</hi> 2. Then faith the Soul, I ſee I <hi>have a merciful high-Prieſt, that knoweth how to pity a poor piece of fleſh, hungring, and thirſting, and full of infirmities.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Again here's comfort ſaith the poor Soul to me, I <hi>was born a leper, under the imputed guilt of Adams ſin, I was conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> in ſin, and <hi>brought forth in iniquity;</hi> But my Saviour was born without ſin, the veſſel was made pure, by the overſhadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Holy Ghoſt and no impure hand contributed to his conveyance into the World. I was born a <hi>Child of wrath,</hi> indebted to juſtice before I knew what I did, but he was born a <hi>Child of Love:</hi> He was born with a knowledge of humane infirmities to know how to pity me, but without ſinful infirmities; That he might be in a capacity, to ſave, and help me. Again ſaith the Soul, Then I ſee a <hi>perfect and ſufficient Saviour.</hi> One <hi>me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God</hi> (conſidering the juſtice of God that could give no remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion without blood,) could not have ſaved me becauſe he could not have died for me, and ſo have deſtroyed him that had the power of death. One <hi>meerly man</hi> could not have ſaved me, for he could not have merited. But a Perſon that was <hi>God, and man;</hi> God, and man in one Perſon, muſt needs be in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect capacity; as man he died, as God he merited, nay the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that was God-man both died, and merited. How ſweet is this to the Soul, torturing it ſelf with thoughts for the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs of its nature, troubled with humane infirmities, perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with thoughts how Chriſt ſhould be able to ſave it, &amp;c. This is but one of his actions,</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>He fulfilled the law for us.</hi> I am not of their mind that
<pb n="784" facs="tcp:61084:397"/>
think that Chriſts active obedience is not imputed, I think the Apoſtle ſpeaks plain enough to the contrary, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3, 4. And if not he, yet the Prophet; <hi>By his knowledge he ſhall juſtifie many.</hi> You read that he was made righteouſneſs for us: And doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs (whatever ſome may fancy) the obedience of the Perſon which was God-man, could not be an homage due from the humane nature of Chriſt (which was indeed but a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;) <hi>Chriſt fulfilling the Law</hi> is exceeding ſweet to the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Soul. This poor Soul when renewed is but renewed in part, &amp; in many things offendeth, and the ſenſe of its daily back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlidings makes it tremble. How ſweet is it now to the Soul, to be able to conclude thus to its ſelf: Though there be much guile found in my heart, and in my mouth, yet in his mouth there was no guile found, though I have been an <hi>Abſolom,</hi> rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling againſt my Heavenly Father, from my youth upward, yet he was an <hi>Adonijah,</hi> a <hi>Son that never diſpleaſed his Father,</hi> 3. <hi>Look upon him in the laying down of his life.</hi> How ſweet is the meditation of it to a poor Soul? <hi>Chriſt crucified</hi> is a bundle of Myrrh; indeed from hence the Soul draweth many pretious ſmells, hence it is that the Soul <hi>ſmelis Spiritual life,</hi> with all the conſequences and dependencies upon it; Hence it ſmells <hi>Spiritual liberty,</hi> with all the ſweet fruits of it: I ſay from hence it <hi>ſmells</hi> Spiritual life to itſelf, when it is almoſt ſuffocated, with the apprehenſion of the guilt of ſin, and cries out, if I pine away in my iniquities how can I then live? And faints at the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the wrath of God due to it, for every ſingle ſin, and much more for the numberleſs number of the ſins which it<note place="margin">Iſa. 53. 5, 6.</note> hath committed; It ſmells that of the Prophet, <hi>Iſa. Ch.</hi> 53. <hi>v.</hi> 5, 6. <hi>He was wounded for our tranſgreſſions, and bruiſed for our iniquities: the Chaſtiſement of our peace lay upon him, and with his</hi>

                  <hi>ſtripes we are healed, v.</hi> 10. His Soul was made <hi>an offering for ſin.</hi> Or that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13. <hi>Chriſt hath Redeemed us from the curſe of the law, being made a curſe for us,</hi> and this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſheth it; I have deſerved to dye (ſaith the Soul) but Chriſt hath died for me. I have deſerved to tread the wine preſs of my Fathers wrath; but he hath trode the <hi>winepreſs of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wrath alone.</hi> I was born a ſlave to luſts and corruptions, but Chriſt by dying hath made me free. Ah! what a bundle of Myrrh is a <hi>crucified Chriſt to the Soul?</hi> Hence it ſmells Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al life, even from his death for we have <hi>Remiſſion of ſins through</hi>

                  <hi>his blood.</hi> It ſmells <hi>Spiritual peace; Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect? it is Chriſt that died, Ro.</hi> 8. 38. It ſmells an <hi>acceſs unto God: The holy of holies being Sprinkled with his blood,</hi> and Heaven itſelf by it Sanctified, and made acceſſible. It ſmells <hi>Spiritual liberty.</hi> For the blood of Chriſt, ſaith the<note place="margin">Heb. 9. 14.</note> Apoſtle, <hi>purgeth the Conſcience from dead works, to ſerve the living God.</hi> It ſmells <hi>Spiritual ſtrength.</hi> For through the croſs of Chriſt (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>my heart is crucified to the World.</hi> Thus you ſee that in this action (or ſuffering rather) Chriſt is to the Soul a bundle of Myrrh. 4. Look upon Chriſt as <hi>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing up from the dead.</hi> He is a <hi>bundle of Myrrh</hi> there too, the Soul from hence again ſmells <hi>Spiritual life,</hi> Rom. 4. 25.

Look upon Chriſt (as the <hi>men of Galilee,</hi> Acts 1. 11.) <hi>Aſcending up to Heaven.</hi> Thus he is alſo a bundle of Myrrh, he <hi>lives,</hi> and from hence <hi>Job</hi> ſmelt, that he ſhould <hi>ſee him with his Eyes,</hi> the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, that ſtood to wait upon his <hi>aſcenſion,</hi> told the <hi>men of Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lee,</hi> ſo much, that as they had ſeen him aſcend, ſo they ſhould ſee him coming again. Hence the believing Soul <hi>ſmells,</hi> that he ſhall <hi>aſcend</hi> too, for <hi>where Chriſt</hi> is <hi>there he muſt be.</hi> The <hi>body is there, the Eagles ſhall flee</hi> to it one day. <hi>He is lifted up,</hi> and every believer ſhall be <hi>drawn after him.</hi> Our <hi>fleſh and</hi> blood ſhall inherit the Kingdom of God.

Look upon Chriſt as <hi>ſitting one the right hand of the Majeſty on high:</hi> So he <hi>is a bundle of Myrrh,</hi> too. Is it ſo ſaith the Soul? Then he hath favour with God, and power with God, and what need I any more then for my God, my Saviour, he

               <p>I Proceed, in opening the <hi>bundle</hi> or <hi>bag,</hi> or <hi>box</hi> of <hi>Myrrh,</hi> which makes my Text give a fragrant ſmell. I have ſhewed that it is Chriſt, who is thus reſembled, and have propounded to ſhew you the aptneſs of the compariſon in five things: I am yet upon the 4th: He is to the believing Soul a <hi>bundle of Myrrh</hi> for ſweetneſs: I propoſed to open this in three particulars:
<pb n="787" facs="tcp:61084:398"/>
ſhewing you, that Chriſt is ſo, 1. <hi>In his mediatory actions.</hi> 2. <hi>In his Spiritual influences.</hi> 3. In <hi>his Goſpel Inſtitutions, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances.</hi> I have done with the firſt and now proceed to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond: To ſhew you the ſweetneſs of Chriſt to the believing Soul.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>In his Spiritual influences. When he aſcended upon high</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.) <hi>he gave gifts unto men:</hi> he gave gifts to his Church: <hi>his Ordinances.</hi> (Of thoſe the Apoſtle ſpeaks:) but he gives other gifts likewiſe, gifts even to the <hi>Rebellious, Pſal.</hi> 68. All theſe are ſummed up under one head: <hi>The gift of the Spirit.</hi> This is that which he calls <hi>the promiſe of the Father.</hi> He was the promiſe of the Father of old, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 27. It was his promiſe, <hi>John</hi> 14. 16. I will pray the <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>he ſhall give you another</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Comforter,</hi> and <hi>he ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide with you for ever: Even the Spirit of truth.</hi> He is ſent in Chriſts name. 26. <hi>v.</hi> he is called the Spirit of Chriſt: hence the influences of the Spirit are the influences of Chriſt. I ſhall inſtance in a ſixfold influence, of the Spirit of Chriſt, upon the Soul, as to all which he is a bundle of Myrrh to his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt is <hi>his convincing influence,</hi> Joh. 16. 8. <hi>When he is come, he will reprove the World of ſin;</hi> In reſpect of this influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the <hi>Spirit of Chriſt</hi> is called <hi>the Spirit of bondage, Rom.</hi> 8. 15. They ſay of <hi>Myrrh,</hi> that in the gathering, it makes the hands of the gatherers exceeding bitter, but gathered, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes incomparably ſweet: Thus it is with the Lord Chriſt as to this influence of the Spirit upon us, the Soul, for the time that it is under this influence, is <hi>full of bitterneſs:</hi> but it turneth to an exceeding great ſweetneſs. The Book which St. <hi>John</hi> did Eat, was in the <hi>Mouth as ſweet as hony, but in the belly more bitter than wormwood.</hi> A fit emblem of ſin. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions of the Spirit of Chriſt are of a quite contrary nature, in the mouth they are as bitter as wormwood: but in the belly they are exceeding ſweet; the Soul in the hour of conviction, is exceedingly ſad, and troubled, but when convinced how it bleſſeth God, who was pleaſed to convince it of ſin? Like the woman, who in an hard labour is full of pain, and wiſheth ſhe had never bred a Child: but being once delivered forgets her pain, and remembers her throws with pleaſure.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſecond influence of the Spirit of Chriſt is <hi>Illumination.</hi>
                  <pb n="788" facs="tcp:61084:399"/>
The Spirit is the Spirit of <hi>wiſdom and knowledge,</hi> Iſaiah 11. 2. <hi>It teacheth us all things,</hi> Joh. 14. 26. 1. Joh. 2. 27. <hi>That is, all things neceſſary to Salvation.</hi> The things <hi>which Eye hath not ſeen, nor Ear heard, nor can it enter into the heart of man to conceive;</hi> even theſe things are <hi>revealed to us by the Spirit,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 9, 10. Concerning the manner of the Spirits teaching, how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the teachings of Ordinances, and yet diſtinct from it, I have elſe where ſhewed you: my buſineſs now is to ſhew you that Chriſt in this influence <hi>is a bundle of Myrrh. Light is ſweet to the Eye</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon)</hi> knowledge is that about which the underſtanding (which is the Eye of the mind) is exerciſed, and is every whit as pleaſant unto the Soul as <hi>light is unto the bodily Eye.</hi> Now as all knowledge is ſweet to the Soul, ſo eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the knowledge, 1. <hi>Of things hidden from others.</hi> 2. Of <hi>ſuch things as are of neareſt concernment to us:</hi> eſpecially, if the knowledge be certain.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I ſay, the <hi>knowledge of ſuch things as are hidden from others:</hi> ſuch knowledge we upon experience find to be very ſweet, and ſuch a knowledge the Spirit of Chriſt gives to the Soul. The Goſpel of Chriſt, <hi>is it ſelf called a myſtery,</hi> a thing hidden from <hi>ages,</hi> and hidden <hi>from the wiſe and prudent.</hi> This indeed is more generally revealed to all, but <hi>more eſpecially</hi> and fully, and clearly to the believing Souls. But further the Spirit of God reveals the <hi>ſecrets of God</hi> to the Souls of the Saints, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 9, 10. Even the <hi>deep things of God,</hi> its <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular election</hi> and the truth of its graces, &amp;c. Now this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is ſweet to the Soul.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The knowledge of ſuch things as are of neareſt concernment to us, is moſt ſweet.</hi> Such is <hi>the teaching of the Spirit</hi> it teacheth us to cry <hi>abba</hi> Father, it teacheth us to <hi>ſee the things that are free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given us of God.</hi> Add to this, that by how much any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is more <hi>certain,</hi> by ſo much it is <hi>more ſweet,</hi> the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is not ſo pleaſed, with probable notions, as <hi>what is matter of demonſtration,</hi> and aſſured to the Soul; ſuch is the teaching of the Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 4. It teacheth <hi>by demonſtration,</hi> leaving no doubting in the Soul. This is a ſecond influence of the Spirit of Chriſt upon the Soul in reſpect of which he is a bundle <hi>of Myrrh</hi> unto the Soul.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third influence of the Spirit of Chriſt, is its <hi>Sanctifying</hi> influence, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 16.—<hi>being Sanctified by the Holy Ghoſt:</hi>
                  <pb n="789" facs="tcp:61084:399"/>
It is Chriſt that <hi>Sanctifieth, Heb.</hi> 2. 11. Sanctification is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed under the Notion of <hi>being conformed to the Image of Chriſt.</hi> Now as to this influence of grace, Chriſt is a <hi>bundle of Myrrh</hi> to the <hi>believing Soul.</hi> The unbeliever hates holineſs, but the Child of God Loves it, and deſires further degrees of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 22. I <hi>delight in the Law of God after the inward man</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 7. 22.) He his highly pleaſed, when he finds the power of grace in his heart, overpowering luſts, and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and his Soul every day growing more and more like God, and like Chriſt, more full of Spiritual deſires, Spiritual affections, his heart more willing to deny it ſelf, to be under the plenary power, and Command of Jeſus Chriſt when he finds, that it is not he that liveth, but it is Chriſt that liveth in him; Chriſt in reſpect of this influence, is to the Souls of his Saints as a bundle of Myrrh.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A fourth influence of Chriſt upon the Soul, is his <hi>ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening influence, Phil.</hi> 4. 13. I can <hi>do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengtheneth me.</hi> He ſtrengtheneth the Soul, 1. In doing <hi>Spiritual duties.</hi> 2. <hi>In reſiſting Corruptions.</hi> 3. <hi>In ſuffering ſharpeſt trials.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 26.</note> The Lord ſtood by me (ſaith <hi>Paul.)</hi> But it is not my preſent buſineſs, to diſcourſe either of the ſeveral ſorts of Spiritual ſtrengthening influences: Nor yet of the ways and methods, by and in which Chriſt meeteth the Soul with ſtrength, and Communicates ſtrength unto it. My work is only to ſhew you that this influence of his is as a bundle of Myrrh to the Soul. Now that Chriſt in this influence is exceeding ſweet to the Soul, needs no other proof, then the daily experience of the Souls of Gods People, how refreſhed do they riſe up from Prayer, when they have found the Spirit of Chriſt in it, helping their infirmities, with ſtrong cryes, and groans? It is ſaid of <hi>Hannah,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. <hi>That ſhe roſe up, and her Countenance was no more ſad.</hi> This was that which made the holy Martyrs take joyfully the <hi>ſpoiling of their goods,</hi> the <hi>burning of their bodies.</hi> And made them feel no more pain (to uſe the <hi>expreſſion</hi> of one of them) then if they had been <hi>upon a bed of Roſes.</hi> So that their Perſecutors curſed them, ſaying <hi>they had a delight to burn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5, A fifth ſort of influences are <hi>the Quickening influences of the Spirit of Chriſt.</hi> I have formerly told you that the Scripture mentioneth a threefold quickening: All of them <hi>from Chriſt,</hi> and by the Spirit. 1. <hi>The quickening of the dead body,</hi> mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="790" facs="tcp:61084:400"/>
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 11. This will be as a <hi>bundle of Myrrh,</hi> exceeding ſweet when it comes, when in the reſurrection we ſhall be <hi>like Angels.</hi> And the thoughts of this are exceeding ſweet, while we live here. 2. The <hi>quickening of the dead Soul,</hi> mentioned <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 1. This is exceeding ſweet to the Soul (when done;) Oh how pleaſant it is to a Soul to remember his converſion, the time, the Sermon when, and by which God was pleaſed at firſt to work upon it, and work a change in it. 3. The <hi>quicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a dull Soul,</hi> labouring under any Spiritual deadneſs, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſs, or inactivity; of this <hi>David</hi> often <hi>Speaks,</hi> and <hi>prays</hi> for it, Pſal. 119. <hi>Quicken me in thy precepts,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>knockings</hi> and <hi>motions</hi> of the holy Spirit, are tireſome and tedious, and exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grievous to a carnal heart, they diſturb its ſweet ſleeps, in its bed of idelneſs, Security, and luſt, but they are exceeding <hi>ſweet</hi> to a gracious heart. The renewed Soul prays for them, thirſts after them, delights in them, and is never more pleaſed then when it feels itſelf moſt alarumed, and awakened, and ſpur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on by them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The laſt ſort of <hi>influences</hi> are the <hi>comforting influences of Chriſt</hi> by his Spirit. The Spirit is called the <hi>comforter</hi> often, <hi>John ch.</hi> 14. &amp; 16. It is a piece of its office, to <hi>ſeal,</hi> and to witneſs; <hi>It witneſſeth with our Spirits that we are the Children of God.</hi> It ſealeth us up to the day of Redemption. I ſhall not need ſtand to prove, that Chriſt in theſe is as <hi>a bundle of Myrrh;</hi> The very name <hi>comforter</hi> imports <hi>ſweetneſs,</hi> and is of it ſelf a <hi>bundle of Myrrh</hi> to the Soul. Now all our <hi>Conſolations</hi> come from Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 1. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 5. He was called the <hi>Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Iſrael.</hi> And the Jewiſh believers waited for him under that Notion, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 25. I have now opened to you the 2d thing, and ſhewed you how Chriſt in his influences is a <hi>bundle of Myrrh.</hi> One thing yet remains.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Chriſt in his Ordinances, and Goſpel Inſtitutions, is a bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of Myrrh.</hi> Chriſt is in his Ordinances. <hi>We preach Chriſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) and we are <hi>Baptized into Chriſt, Rom.</hi> 6. And for the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 10. <hi>It is the Communion of the Body, and Blood of Chriſt.</hi> Chriſt in theſe is a bundle of Myrrh to the Souls of believers. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, Chriſt <hi>in theſe</hi> is only ſweet upon the former account, <hi>viz.</hi> in reſpect of his <hi>influences,</hi> which he is pleaſed to convey in and through theſe <hi>Organs,</hi> and ſeparated from theſe, Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="791" facs="tcp:61084:400"/>
ſignify little but burthen to the Soul. Ordinances are ſweet to the Soul two waies. 1. <hi>As God is pleaſed in, and by them actually to convey the influences of Chriſt, and his grace to the Soul.</hi> Thus they are only <hi>ſweet</hi> to the Soul, when it ſees the <hi>power and glory of God in his Sanctuary,</hi> 2. <hi>As they are under a divine appointment in order to that End.</hi> Thus Ordinances are ſweet to the gracious Soul, though at preſent, the Soul doth not meet with, and enjoy God in them: yet ſaith the Soul, they are thoſe appointments, wherein God hath ſaid he will be found, and inſtituted of God, in order to that end, and it may be my lot, as well as others, to meet with God in them, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Soul prizeth them; how precious Ordinances (even thoſe which were <hi>carnal</hi> (as the Apoſtle calls them) under the Jewiſh Oeconomy) were to the Servants of God who liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in thoſe times, appears by the eminent inſtances of <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42, &amp;c. The Pſalmiſt ſpeaks of the Body of Jews, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84. <hi>v.</hi> 6. That they paſſed <hi>through the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of Bacah</hi> and went <hi>from ſtrength to ſtrength,</hi> until <hi>they all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared before God in</hi> Zion. And thus I have opened to you the fourth thing in this ſimilitude, ſhewing you how aptly Chriſt is compared to a bundle of <hi>Myrrh,</hi> viz. For <hi>ſweetneſs:</hi> but I alſo noted two things hinted in the term of <hi>bundle;</hi> a <hi>bundle, or bag</hi> notes a quantity of ſweets. 2. Men uſe to bind up things in <hi>bundles,</hi> for their better <hi>preſervation.</hi> Hence two things more.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Chriſt is a <hi>bundle of Myrrh.</hi> He is an <hi>heap of ſweetneſſes,</hi> exceeding ſweet to the gracious Soul. The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>(Col.</hi> 2. 3.) That all the <hi>treaſures of wiſdom are in Chriſt.</hi> All the treaſures of Soul ſweetneſs are in Chriſt alſo. There are other things that are ſweet to the <hi>Worldling,</hi> and him that is a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to Chriſt. <hi>Stollen waters are ſweet</hi> to the <hi>Thief,</hi> Prov. 9. 17. <hi>The bread of deceit is ſweet</hi> to the <hi>deceiver, Prov.</hi> 20. 17. <hi>Luſt is</hi> ſweet to the <hi>unclean</hi> Perſon: yea and to the exterior ſenſes of a gracious Soul other things may be ſweet to the Child of God. But to the Soul of the Saint (conſidered as a Saint) nothing is ſweet but Chriſt, he is its <hi>bundle of Myrrh,</hi> all the pleaſure, and ſweetneſs, and delight that it hath in the World on this ſide of Heaven, is either in the <hi>meditation of Chriſt</hi> or <hi>application of him, fiducially,</hi> or aſſuredly; all his hopes of good are in Chriſt. <hi>Chriſt in him the hopes of glory.</hi> All his injoyments, which he valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, are the enjoyments of Chriſt, and his grace, he is a bundle of Myrrh unto it.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="792" facs="tcp:61084:401"/>
6. Laſtly. Chriſt is to it as <hi>a bundle of Myrrh, In regard of of its great care and diligence</hi> to <hi>preſerve and keep alive its ſenſe, and enjoyments of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The gracious Soul is very careful to keep its view of Chriſt. Obſerve the next words. <hi>He ſhall lye all night betwixt my breaſts</hi> (of which hereafter.) Obſerve again this Spouſes carriage, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3. 4. Upon her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of Chriſt when he had abſented himſelf, <hi>I held him, and would not let him go, until I had brought him into my Mothers houſe: into the Chamber, of her that conceived me.</hi> See alſo, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8. <hi>v.</hi> 1. The Soul that hath had any experiences of Chriſt and of the influences of his grace, binds them up as it were in a bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle. The memory of that Soul is the bag and the ſtring too. Thus the Pſalmiſt <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77. 5. I <hi>have conſidered the days of old, the years of ancient times.</hi> I <hi>call to remembrance my Song in the night, v.</hi> 11. I <hi>will remember the works of the Lord, ſurely I will remember thy wonders of old.</hi> I <hi>will meditate alſo of all thy works, and talk of all thy doings.</hi> And indeed this needeth no further proof then what my former diſcourſe hath given it, for it is very connatural to us, to be careful in the preſerving, and keeping <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>loſe, and ſafe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is precious to us. The Worldling ties up his mony in bags, and is very careful to keep ſafely what he hath got with care; the Lady keeps her perfumes, and Jewels ſafe; ſo doth the Scholar his Books; indeed ſo doth every one, whatſoever he accounteth ſweet and pretious: Now nothing being more ſweet and precious to the Soul then Jeſus Chriſt and his influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, it is as natural to him to indeavour the preſervation of them. But I have ſpake enough to the explication, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the point.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Uſe 1.</note> Have you heard, that Chriſt is to the Soul, as a <hi>bundle of Myrrh?</hi> How ſottiſh then is the generality of the World, that either deſpiſe, or neglect their intereſt in him.

Drink, yea, drink abundantly O you beloved.</hi> Chriſt incarnate, crucified, aſcended up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſitting at Gods right Hand, is daily preached to poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. And what is their language, other then that of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, Iſa. 53. 3. <hi>He hath no form, no comelineſs: There is no beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that we ſhould deſire him?</hi> People that live in theſe lightſome parts of the World, dwell upon the <hi>mountain of Myrrh, upon the hill of frankincenſe</hi> (to uſe the expreſſion, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4. 6.) and yet how few are thoſe that look after and diſcern any ſweetneſs in Jeſus Chriſt? What is the reaſon? Are not theſe men rational perſons as well as believers? How comes it that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is as a bundle of Myrrh to a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Soul, and not at all pretious unto others? I will aſſign a double reaſon.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt is their want of <hi>Spiritual ſenſes.</hi> There are but few that have <hi>ſenſes exerciſed to diſcern between Good and Evil. Heb.</hi> 5. <hi>ult.)</hi> the Carnal man is ſaid to be dead in ſin, <hi>life and ſenſe</hi> go together, the dead man ſmells nothing. The Natural Soul is a dead Soul. He hath Natural ſenſes, he diſcerns the ſweetneſs of Hony to his taſt, Muſick to his Ear, fair and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful objects to his Eye, Perfumes to his Noſtrils, the ſweetneſs of notions to his underſtanding, but he diſcerns no ſweetneſs in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things, he <hi>ſavours not the things of the Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. But Secondly, His <hi>Noſtrils are choked with other Smells.</hi> The vitiated pallat taſts not the ſweetneſs of the beſt meat, the Noſtrils ſuffocated with ſtinks diſcern not the ſweetneſs of the beſt Perfumes; the Souls of unbelievers, are filled and ſuffoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the ſmells of the World: One with the ſmell of unjuſt gain, <hi>Dulcis odor lucri,</hi> he cannot ſmell the ſweetneſs of Chriſt, who commands him to leave the gain of injuſtice, to diſtribute and give to the poor, to avoid covetouſneſs which is Idolatry; another is ſuffocated with the ſavour of Worldly buſineſs and imployments, he ſmells the ſmell of a field which the Lord hath bleſt, the ſmell of his Worldly buſineſs puts out the ſmell of Chriſts ſweetneſs, he is cumbred about many things, and he ſmells no ſweetneſs in the One thing neceſſary. A third hath his ſmell adulterated with <hi>ſordid luſts,</hi> the ſmell of a drunken cup, of a fordid wanton, ſpoils him for ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling this <hi>bundle of Myrrh,</hi> which is infinitely more ſweet. But give me leave to turn this complaint and reproof into an Exhortation.</p>
               <p>

                  <note place="margin">Uſe 2.</note> In the firſt place. <hi>O you fools, when will you be wiſe?</hi> You that are creatures of pleaſure, and are not ſatisfied with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ranſacking of the whole Creation for objects of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, <hi>Turn in hither I beſeech you,</hi> and <hi>tell me if there be any ſweetneſs like this bundle of Myrrh.</hi> Your Eye engageth your Tongue to call the comely face <hi>ſweet;</hi> Alas!

You hear the voice of a ſinging man or Woman, &amp; you think it ſweet, but that voice will one day grow hoarſe, or you may be in a ſtate, that it will grate upon your Ears, and be offenſive to you. You ſmell a powder or perfume, and you muſt have it and wear it about you, becauſe it is ſweet: But what are all theſe to one Chriſt, who is ſweeteſt to the Soul in an evil day, who doth not refreſh the outward man ſo much as the inward man; whoſe ſweetneſs raviſheth every ſoul that is poſſeſſed of it, never corrupts nor decaies, nor ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, Imagine all the lines of beauty, which adorn all ſublunary faces, to be brought into one face, that face muſt be very love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: But all nothing to the <hi>face of Chriſt,</hi> in the Eye of a believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Soul.

                  <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. What the Country of <hi>Arabia</hi> was for Myrrh, that is every place (where the Goſpel is preached) as to the gaining of Chriſt. It is true there are many Countries where the Goſpel of Chriſt is not preached, but <hi>England</hi> is a <hi>mountain of Myrrh,</hi> and it drops every day amongſt you.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I told you that in the Country where the Myrrh <hi>grew e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very</hi>
                  <pb n="795" facs="tcp:61084:402"/>
                  <hi>one gathered it not:</hi> But I told you it was <hi>their own fault,</hi> either deſpiſing through ignorance, or through lazineſs neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their opportunity; in the Country where Chriſt is Preach'd, every one <hi>receives him not,</hi> but it is their own fault. I do not think it is true, in every ſenſe, <hi>that every man may be ſaved that will; This</hi> phraſe implies a power in our ſelves to Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual actions: but it is unqueſtionably true that <hi>if any Soul ſitting under the Goſpel periſh, it is becauſe it will not be ſaved. You will not come to me</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>that you may have life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. I told you indeed that <hi>there is a ſeaſon,</hi> (as there was for gathering Myrrh) <hi>which if neglected, we get no ſhare in Chriſt.</hi> The fooliſh Virgins came when the <hi>gate was ſhut.</hi> Many <hi>ſhall ſeek</hi> and <hi>ſhall not enter.</hi> There is a <hi>ſeaſon of grace.</hi> And ſome Divines think that this ſeaſon is oft times finiſhed while our life yet laſteth, and the means of grace continue: Whether it be ſo or no I cannot determine; ſure I am, thou haſt no ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent reaſon to conclude thy ſeaſon paſt, whiles yet thy life laſts, and the means are continued, eſpecially if God yet at laſt give thee an heart to come unto Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Doeſt thou ask what thou ſhouldeſt do? Remember what I told you, concerning the procuring of the dropping of Myrrh. 1. They made an <hi>inciſion</hi> into the tree. 2. They <hi>ſet ſomething to receive it. The inciſion</hi> is made already. The Souldiers made that when they pierced thy Saviours ſide.</p>
               <p>There is nothing left for thee to do, but to <hi>open thy heart</hi> to receive thoſe influences of grace which freely drop from a crucified Chriſt: yea God muſt do that too. The truth is, thou haſt nothing to do more then to go up to the <hi>mountain of Myrrh,</hi> to <hi>wait upon God in his Ordinances,</hi> to ſit under Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel diſpenſations and to <hi>look up to Heaven</hi> for further grace. Only remember the <hi>full Soul loaths the Hony-Comb,</hi> the full diſh receives not the moſt precious liquor; and while thy Soul is full of the love of the World and love of luſts, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives no Myrrh, while it is full of the love of pleaſures, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs, froth and idleneſs, it is like the riven diſh, that holds nothing. But to come to a concluſion,</p>

things. 1. <hi>Be often taking the ſavour of him:</hi> The woman that hath a rare ſmelling flower, or perfume, wears it in her boſom ſhe ſuffers not the firſt to dye in her Garden, nor the latter to evaporate in her cabinet, but ſhe is often ſmelling of it. Oh that the Children of God would make as much uſe of Chriſt, that they would not let his ſweetneſs in a Goſpel ordinance evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate into the Air, nor the ſweetneſs of his mediatory actions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in the Goſpel die in ſheets of Paper, but that they would ſtudy the Scriptures, meditate on the Word, think over Goſpel Sermons when they have heard them! Oh that they would wear, the remembrance of Chriſts actions upon their hearts e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day, how ſweet would it be to their Souls? How pleaſant to their thoughts! the lazy ſtudent loſeth the ſweetneſs of thoſe thouſand notions, that are in his Books, becauſe he never reads his Books, nor ſpends time in ſtudying them: The negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Chriſtian loſeth much of that infinite ſweetneſs that his Soul might have by reflecting upon the Goſpel ſtory, and Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel truths, for want of <hi>meditating</hi> upon them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Be <hi>exceeding careful to preſerve</hi> the <hi>influences of Chriſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your Souls</hi> and <hi>your experiences of his love.</hi> Shall the woman bind up her ſweet flowers in a poſy, and the Lady carefully tye up her perfumes in bags and glaſſes, that they might not loſe their ſcent, and ſhe the ſweetneſs of them? And ſhall a Chriſtian poſſeſſed of the ſweet influences of grace, poſſeſſed of the preſence of Jeſus Chriſt do nothing to preſerve it. Say with the Spouſe here, <hi>he ſhall lodge all night betwixt my breaſts;</hi> do as the Spouſe, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3. When ſhe had found him whom her Soul loved, <hi>ſhe held him, ſhe would not let him go, till ſhe had carried him to her Mothers houſe, to the houſe of her that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived her.</hi> Bind up your experiences of the Love of Chriſt in ſo many bundles, and do what in you lyes to preſerve his influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences in the Vigour of them, would you know how you might preſerve them? There is no better way then for you to keep up in your Souls, an high value and eſteem of them; it is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily for want of love, that the <hi>Beloved</hi> withdraws himſelf.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>You are communicative, of your ſweet perfumes.</hi> The Lady cannot wear her ſtrong perfumes, but others whom ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth near will partake of her ſweetneſs. It is of the Nature of the perfume to ſeaſon the whole Air. She will hardly have a perfume, bat out of a deſire to have it taken notice of, ſhe will
<pb n="797" facs="tcp:61084:403"/>
be holding it to the Noſtrils of others. Oh that you who are poſſeſſed of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>this bundle of Myrrh,</hi> would be as communicative of that alſo: That you would be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending Chriſt (as the Woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> did, <hi>John.</hi> 4.) to your Neighbours, Kindred, Children, Friends, Acquaintance, that they alſo might follow after him in the <hi>ſavour of his precious ointments.</hi> This is a piece of Chriſtians duty. <hi>When thou art converted</hi> (ſaith our Saviour to Peter) <hi>ſtrengthen thy Brethren.</hi> Thus to do good, and to diſtribute forget not, for with ſuch ſervice God is well pleaſed: But to come to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Is Chriſt to the <hi>believers a bundle of Myrrh?</hi> Let not <hi>them be as bundles of Nettles to him.</hi> The Bundle of Myrrh gives a pleaſant ſmell, <hi>cheereth the ſenſes.</hi> The bundle of Nettles Prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and offendeth, and grieveth the Noſtrils; It is the Apoſtles exhortation Eph. 4. 30. <hi>Grieve not the holy Spirit by which you are ſealed to the day of redemption.</hi> The Exhortation is to holineſs of Converſation: The Argument is <hi>from the love of Chriſt to you.</hi> The love of God <hi>conſtraineth</hi> (ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle.) There are many arguments to preſs holineſs from, none ſo ingenuous, none ſo conſtraining to an ingenuous Soul, as the ſweetneſs of Jeſus Chriſt to it. It breaks the heart of an ingenuous Child to remember its frowardneſs to an indulgent Father, and a tender Mother. Love worketh much upon a good Nature. Study this Argument and the force of it upon your Souls to make you perfect holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the Lords fear.</p>

               <p>I Have united the bundle of Myrrh in my Text, that I might give you the fuller ſmell thereof. Chriſt is the Poſie of his Saints; we muſt now find him a convenient place; the Text aſſigns him a Poſies place, about, or betwixt the breaſts, not upon her <hi>ſhoulders,</hi> as if he were her burthen, nor behind her back, where ſhe could not view him, but in her breaſt, where ſhe may be alwaies pleaſing her ſenſes with him. The Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 8. ſays, <hi>I have ſet the Lord alwaies before me, he is at my right hand, therefore I ſhall not be moved. De Ponte</hi> notes, that the believing Soul in the time of ſpiritual Combate, ſetteth Chriſt at her right hand, but in the time of Peace ſhe lodgeth him betwixt her breaſts. It was an old uſage, ſaith <hi>Atheneus,</hi> to anoint the breaſt with Myrrh, becauſe of its vertue to ſtrengthen the heart; here our Spouſe placeth her bundle of Myrrh.</p>
               <p>Not to trouble you with the ſtrained fancies of Interpreters, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Spouſe's breaſts; <hi>In mammis ſignum amoris:</hi> the place betwixt the breaſts is near to the heart, and the ſeat of the beloved Object; it is the beloved Husband, and the Beloved Babe that is allowed to lodge betwixt the breaſts. She might have ſaid he ſhall lodge near my heart, but ſhe rather chuſeth to ſay, <hi>betwixt my breaſts,</hi> (which are an outward part, nigh to the heart) intimating that ſhe would not only bear Chriſt upon her heart, but expreſs her love, by living to Chriſt in her outward converſation. But not to overſtrain the Metaphor, ſhe doth not ſay, he ſhall <hi>come,</hi> but he <hi>ſhall lodge,</hi> or lodge all night betwixt my breaſts. There are two Propoſitions which I named from theſe words, and which yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main to be diſcourſed:</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> That the believing Soul is wonderfully deſirous of Chriſt's abiding with it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That to engage him to ſuch an abode, ſhe will allow him a room betwixt her breaſts.</hi> The latter will be a proof to the former, &amp; come in collaterally, while I handle the former.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="799" facs="tcp:61084:404"/>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> That a gracious heart will be exceeding deſirous of Chriſt's abiding with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ſhall ſpeak to this Propoſition in this Method: 1. Shewing you what are thoſe</hi> lodgings and abidings of Chriſt with, and upon the Soul, of which the gracious heart is ſo exceedingly deſirous. <hi>2.</hi> How it doth appear that a believing Soul is ſo fond of Chriſt's abidings with it: <hi>3,</hi> Whence it is that ſhe is thus exceeding fond of Chriſt's lodgings and abidings with it. <hi>4.</hi> I ſhall apply the whole.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> 1. What is to be underſtood by the lodging or abiding of Chriſt with the Soul?</p>
               <p>You read in Scripture of Chriſt's <hi>abiding</hi> with the Soul, and the <hi>Soul's abiding</hi> with Chriſt. The firſt is mentioned as our priviledge, the ſecond as our duty. Of the firſt you read, <hi>John</hi> 14. 23. <hi>My Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and I will come unto him, and we will make our abode with him.</hi> Of the ſecond, <hi>John</hi> 15. 6. <hi>If a man a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ide not in me, he is cut off,</hi> &amp;c. So again, <hi>v.</hi> 6. each depending upon the other; for it is <hi>God's Covenant: I will never depart from you to do you good, and I will put my fear into your hearts, that you ſhall never depart from me.</hi> Abiding, or lodging in the primary Notion, ſignifieth <hi>the continuance of ſome corporeal preſence</hi> transferred to ſpiritual things, it ſignifies The <hi>continuance of a priviledge,</hi> or <hi>perſeverance in a duty.</hi> Chriſt's abode with us ſignifies the firſt; our <hi>abiding with him</hi> ſignifies the latter, each of them expreſſed in Scripture, by various expreſſions. Chriſt's abiding with us, is expreſſed, <hi>John</hi> 14. 16. <hi>By the abidings of the Comforter,</hi> by the abiding of the <hi>anointing Oil,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 26. It is oppoſed to the momentany, and ſhort refreſhings of grace, when to uſe that other phraſe of Scripture, God is to the Soul but <hi>as a wayfaring man, that tarries but for a night.</hi> Our abidings with, and in Chriſt, are alſo variouſly expreſſed, by the <hi>abidings of that in us which we have received,</hi> 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 24. by <hi>abiding in light,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 10. and the <hi>Word of God abiding in us,</hi> v. 14. by <hi>abiding in the Doctrine of Chriſt, Joh.</hi> 2. <hi>ep. v.</hi> 9. But I have nothing to do ſave only with the former Notion. In ſhort, The abidings of Chriſt with the Soul import two things.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> The permanency of his Union with the Soul, continuing the ſtate of Juſtification, <hi>1 Joh. 3. 24.</hi> Hereby we know he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given to us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The conſtancy of his gracious Influences upon us,</hi> which <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> 21. he calls <hi>A manifeſting of himſelf unto us;</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 22. his <hi>abode with us.</hi> This is alſo the abiding of the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter
<pb n="800" facs="tcp:61084:405"/>
mentioned, <hi>v.</hi> 16. This is the lodging of Chriſt betwixt the Soul's breaſts. This it is of which the gracious Soul is ſo exceeding fond and covetous: And ſo much ſhall ſerve for the firſt Queſtion. I come to the ſecond.</p>
               <p>Qu. <hi>2.</hi> How doth it appear that a gracious Soul is ſo deſirous of Chriſt's abidings with it?</p>
               <p>There are three waies by which the Earneſt deſire of our friends abode with us are diſcernable to others: 1. By <hi>Verbal Expreſſions.</hi> 2. <hi>Real Actions.</hi> 3. <hi>Vehement Paſſions.</hi> By all theſe the believing Soul's deſires that Chriſt ſhould lodge with it, have been, and are diſcernable.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Verbal Expreſſions</hi> (before the World was ſo far debaucht as now, that none knows by the Index of the Tongue what the Clock ſtrikes in the heart) were ſufficient Evidences of cordial deſires. The Children of God cannot lye unto him, we may therefore from their words conclude ſtill. If you look upon the Saints or Church in former times, ſee what the Church ſaith, <hi>Jer.</hi> 14. 8. <hi>O thou hope of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>the Saviour thereof in times of trouble, why ſhouldeſt thou be as a ſtranger in the Land, as a wayfaring man, that turneth aſide to tarry for a night?</hi> The expreſſions of <hi>David</hi> in the <hi>Pſalms</hi> this way are very many; this is it which he means by <hi>the lifting up of God's Countenance upon him,</hi> which he ſo paſſionately deſires above <hi>Corn, Wine,</hi> and <hi>Oil, Pſal.</hi> 4. for which he prefers the place of a <hi>door<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper in the houſe of God,</hi> before <hi>dwelling in the Tents of wickedneſs, Pſal.</hi> 84. Indeed, if you look upon the whole ſum of the deſires both of <hi>David,</hi> and other Saints, who ſtand upon ſacred Record, you will find that as to ſpiritual things, all their deſires are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in this one, that God would abide with them, lodge all night betwixt their breaſts. And the ſame Spirit yet breatheth in the Souls of all that fear the Lord. I need do no more for the proof of this, than appeal to the experience of all ſuch who have in the leaſt degree taſted how good the Lord is; what's the ſum of all their prayers? what's their language to one another, and to all the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of God, to whom at any time they addreſs themſelves? but oh that they might find the <hi>Abidings of the Comforter with their Souls,</hi> the abidings of the ſtrengthening and quickening Spirit of God with them! Oh that Chriſt would not be as a ſtranger in their Souls, nor as a wayfaring man that turneth in to their Souls for a night!</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Earneſt deſires of gracious Souls for the <hi>abidings of Chriſt with them,</hi> are evident alſo upon the conſideration of what they
<pb n="801" facs="tcp:61084:405"/>
will be ready to do for the <hi>continuance of them:</hi> This is in part hinted in the Text: He ſhall lodge, or ſtay, or lie all night <hi>betwixt my breaſts,</hi> which metaphorical expreſſion ſignifies (by interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) theſe two things:</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> I will deny him nothing which he ſhall deſire of me, ſo I may but keep his company.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> I will entertain him with the higheſt demonſtrations of cordial Affection.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I will deny <hi>him nothing which he ſhall deſire of me.</hi> The Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will deny nothing to that Child, nor the Wife to that Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, which either of them allow to lodge betwixt their breaſts. The believing Soul will deny Chriſt nothing, ſo it may keep his preſence with her. Will he have the man do for him? <hi>Lord,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 9. 6. <hi>What wilt thou have me to do?</hi> Will he have the<note place="margin">Acts 9. 6. Acts 21. 11.</note> man <hi>to die for him? I am ready</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 21. 11.) <hi>not to be bound only, but alſo to die at</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>for the Name of the Lord Jė<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</hi> Will he have it deny it ſelf, diſtribute and give to the poor, make ſatisfaction where he hath done injury? No ſooner is <hi>Zacheus</hi> told that <hi>Chriſt was come to his houſe,</hi> but he cries, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19. 5, 8. <hi>Lord, the half of my goods I give to the Poor, and if I have taken any<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thing from any by falſe accuſation, I reſtore him fourfold.</hi> Will he have <hi>Peter gird himſelf, and come to him upon the waters? Peter</hi> will do it immediately. Doth he call <hi>Simon</hi> and <hi>Andrew</hi> from their Nets to follow him, upon a promiſe that they ſhall be made Fiſhers of men? and doth he by and by require <hi>James</hi> and <hi>Zebedee</hi> to do the like? they immediately <hi>leave their Father, forſake their Nets, and follow him,</hi> Mark 1. 16, 17, 18.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The phraſe ſignifies as much as, <hi>I will entertain him with the higheſt Evidences of moſt cordial Affection.</hi> I have more than once noted, that the heart lies under the left breaſt; however, the breaſts are the place of love. It were endleſs to enlarge upon thoſe ſeveral Scriptures expreſſing the ſatisfaction of gracious Souls, upon the preſence of Chriſt with them, or his returns of preſence to them. One or two of them ſhall ſuffice. The firſt ſhall be that of <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 146. You will diſcern upon the reading of that Pſalm, that God had returned to his Soul in Influences of mercy, teſtifying his gracious preſence, he had <hi>heard his ſupplication,</hi> v. 1. <hi>Inclined his Ear unto him,</hi> v. 2. helped him, <hi>v.</hi> 6. Mark with what a ſatisfaction his Soul receiveth theſe Influences; <hi>v.</hi> 2. <hi>I will call upon him as long as I live; v.</hi> 7. <hi>Return unto thy reſt O my Soul; v.</hi> 12. <hi>What</hi>
                  <pb n="802" facs="tcp:61084:406"/>
                  <hi>ſhall I render to the Lord for all his benefits; I will take the cup of Salvation,</hi> &amp;c. v. 16. <hi>Oh Lord, truly I am thy Servant, I am thy Servant, and the Son of thy handmaid,</hi> &amp;c. How welcome is the preſence of God to <hi>Davids</hi> Soul? Do you uſe to ſay to your friend? Sir, what ſhall I provide for you? I think my ſelf much beholden to you, I am much your Servant for this kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, rejoiced to ſee you, &amp;c. Obſerve if <hi>David</hi> here ſpeaketh not much the ſame language. The other inſtance ſhall be that of the Spouſe, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3. 4. when ſhe had recovered her belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>I found him whom my Soul Loveth,</hi> I held him <hi>and would not let him go, untill I had brought him into my Mothers houſe, and into the Chamber of her that canceived me.</hi> The Child knoweth not how to expreſs its love to its friend better then by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him or her home to its Mothers, or Fathers houſe. What need any further evidence then that exuberance of joy which is found in every gracious Soul, upon any return of divine love which may evidence Chriſta abiding with it?</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Vehement paſſions</hi> will alſo diſcover a gracious Souls de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to the Enjoyment of Chriſt, and his abidings with the Soul. When they ſaw our Saviour weep over <hi>Lazarus</hi> his grave, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11. They cry out, <hi>How he loved him!</hi> He that ſeeth a Friend mourn when his Friend is gone from him, or perhaps but go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the woman jealous of any, whom ſhe but ſuſpects would draw away her husband from her, falling into fits of paſſion whes;he doth but fear ſuch a thing, will eaſily conclude, that this friend, this Wife is eagerly deſirous of the preſence and abiding of his friend, or her husband with her; and Secondly he that obſerves the jealouſy of a gracious Soul, over the Lord its Saviour, and of every ſin of Omiſſion, or Commiſſion which it ſuſpecteth as that which may probably ſeparate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt his Soul and it. He that obſerveth what ſlaviſh fear the Chriſtian (yet living in the enjoyments of God) is often tormented with left he ſhould loſe his beloved preſence, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And no wonder though they be ſo as we ſhall ſee by enquiring upon the third queſtion.</p>

               <p>To make a thing the object of a reaſonable Soul's deſire, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, <hi>That the underſtanding conceive it under the Notion of good, and ſome good which it wanteth, and may poſſibly obtain,</hi> and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the degree of goodneſs apprehended in an object propoſed, ſo is the motion of a reaſonable Soul's deſire <hi>more or leſs towards it.</hi> Now that which appears to us as good, appears ſo, 1. <hi>Under the notion of profitable and advantageous;</hi> Or, 2. <hi>Under the notion of ſweet and pleaſant,</hi> or <hi>under the notion of vertaous and honourable.</hi> It is almoſt impoſſible to conceive, but that the ſpiritually enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Soul ſhould apprehend the <hi>abidings of Chriſt</hi> with it tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently good upon all theſe accounts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Under the notion of Vertuous and Honourable.</hi> What greater honour can betide a poor creature than to have the Almighty pitch his Tents in and with it? for the Lord of Heaven and Earth to make his abode with a Worm? the Eternal Son of God to dwell with Duſt and Aſhes, yea and delight to dwell and continue with it? Such honour have all the Saints, and no wonder if they be ſo fond of it. Doth <hi>Abigail</hi> think it an honour to be but a Servant to an Earthly <hi>David?</hi> and <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> judge it an honour to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to eat Bread at his Table? What is it then to have the Son of God in the Arms of our Souls, and to have him dwell in our hearts, and make his abode there?</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Nor certainly can any thing be more ſweet to a gracious Soul.</hi> The joy and peace (that peace which paſſeth all underſtanding) which is the iſſue of believing, ebbs and flows according to the abidings of Chriſt with the Soul: His preſence makes an Heaven, and his abſence makes an Hell there. There are two Paſſions, which are like overflowing Floods, and drown a Soul's beauty and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Grief;</hi> the preſence of Chriſt with the Soul keeps them both under. The Soul of the Saint cannot fear, when <hi>it knows</hi> that it is <hi>He that ſaveth it, and upholdeth it with the hand of his Righteouſneſs, and the Children of the Bride-Chamber</hi> (himſelf told us) <hi>cannot mourn while the Bridegroom is with them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. For the <hi>advantage which accrews to the Soul by the abidings of chriſt with it;</hi> beſides that already mentioned, in the quiet and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſecurity which it hath by his company, which is infinitely above the value of all other concernments; I ſay, beſides that, the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage is exceeding great. I will mention but two things.</p>

1. <hi>Its enemies are ſtill;</hi> when the Captain of our Salvation is in our quarters, there's no great fear that the enemy will beat them up. The tempter hath nothing to ſay, whiles he that ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours the tempted is ſpeaking peace to the Soul, God muſt firſt ſay to the Devil, <hi>behold this Soul is in thy hands,</hi> before he can meddle with it. And our own inbred enemies, thoſe of our own houſe (our innate luſts and Corruptions I mean) are as ſtill as our grand Adverſary: The very waters of <hi>Marah</hi> themſelves turned ſweet when this <hi>Tree</hi> of life is in them. Our hearts loſe much of their bitterneſs by the preſence of Chriſt in them, it is when the Sun is down, that the Frogs and Toads croak and the Dors and Bats fly. It is in the night when the Thief ſteals. The time of Chriſts withdrawings from the Soul is the time when <hi>Sathan</hi> moleſts, and luſts are moſt buſy.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Souls Spikenard</hi> then ſends <hi>forth its pleaſant ſmell.</hi> You had it in the former verſe. I ſhewed you there what dependence the exerciſe of our grace hath upon Chriſts preſence with us, both in reſpect of his exciting and aſſiſting influence. Chriſt ſpeaks it plain in that excellent parable of the vine, and the branches, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 5. <hi>He that abidath in me, and I in him, the ſame bringeth forth fruit,</hi> for <hi>without me you can do nothing—</hi>v. 6. <hi>The ſame bringeth forth much fruit.</hi> Otherwiſe the Soul <hi>wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, v.</hi> 6. Naturaliſts ſay that in thoſe Countries which abounded with Myrrh, they were wont to bind <hi>bundles</hi> of it to <hi>the heart,</hi> or to anoint it with the Gum; the uſe of it was to ſtrengthen the heart againſt what was noxious, and unto a due diſcharge of its natural operations. It is <hi>Gregories</hi> obſervation, (or ſimilitude rather) that the Soul that applies Chriſt to its heart, and which findeth his influence will find it like a bundle or an anointing of Myrrh ſtrengthening the Soul againſt the prevailings of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and filling it with a Spiritual heat, and fitneſs for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly operations. And thus I have ſhewed you juſt reaſon, why the lodgings or abidings of Chriſt with a gracious Soul are ſo deſirable to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But will ſome poor Soul ſay? Can Chriſt not abide with that Soul which he hath once owned, is his love mutable, is he <hi>not the God that changeth not,</hi> but loveth to the end whom he once loveth?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, The Love of Chriſt is an abiding love, he is not <hi>yea and nay</hi> with the Soul, upon which he hath once fixed his heart, <hi>whom he loveth he loveth to the end.</hi>

1. <hi>His union with the Soul abideth.</hi> Chriſt once in us and ever in us, is a truth to which we muſt adhere, that corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which could not at firſt prevent it, ſhall never he of force to diſſolve it; but the <hi>ſenſe of this union</hi> may fail. The indwelling Spirit ſhall not be diſſeiſed, but the Spirit as a comforter may fail the Souls of the Saints. <hi>When wilt thou comfort me?</hi> (ſaith the man after Gods own heart.) Beſides that our ſtate of juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is to be maintained by the performance of our Spiritual duty, and there can be no juſtified Soul, that doth not earneſtly deſire its own continuance in that ſtate.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>His neceſſary influences upon the Soul abide too.</hi> The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe muſt ſtand good, I will never leave thee nor forſake thee, nor can it be imagined that ſo noble and vertual an head as the Lord Jeſus Chriſt can be united to any member of his Spiritual body without a proportionable influence upon it: or that the ſeed of God in the Soul ſhould be wholly inactive. But Spiritual deſires are alſo the ſacred means, which God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the preſervation of theſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But <hi>Gradual abidings of Chriſt in the Soul may fail.</hi> He may not abide with the Soul in ſuch proportions of Spiritual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, at all times. Now the degrees of Spiritual influence from Chriſt are highly deſirable to a gracious Soul. But I have ſpake enough to the explication and confirmation of the point. I come now to the Application.</p>
               <p>

               <p n="3">3. A man may ſay, <hi>Oh that Chriſt would come betwixt my breaſts, that yet is not the Spouſe of Chriſt.</hi> There's ſcarce a wretch living but at one time or other wiſheth Chriſt would ſpeak to his Soul pardon and peace; 'tis one thing for a woman to deſire the Phyſitian may make applications to her breaſts, when full of pain, that yet will not ſay he ſhall lodge betwixt her breaſts, you ſee there may be a great many miſtakes in this point, but plainly let me ask you two or three queſtions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Are you willing to open the ſecrets of your Souls to Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> There's many a one is willing that Chriſt ſhould come ſo near him as his Ear, but not into his heart; canſt thou ſay that thy Soul cleaveth to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that thou deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt he ſhould enter into its ſecrets, not only to tip thy tongue, regulate thy Countenance, but to Command in thy heart?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Art thou willing that Chriſt ſhould <hi>lodge all night with thy Soul?</hi> Not ſerve thee only by fits to cure thy heart akings, but that he ſhould lodge and dwell with thee; make an abode with thy Soul.</p>

               <p>By this, O Chriſtian I ſhalt thou know if indeed thou beeſt the Spouſe of the Lord Jeſus, and not an harlot. I might have further added. That the Soul that is ſo, ſays ſo of no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Deal faithfully I beſeech you with your own Souls; the World is full of pretenders, but I fear me exceeding thin of ſuch as can ſay, and ſay it in truth, and ſay it cordially, That Chriſt is he, and he alone whom they deſire ſhould lodge and ſtay betwixt their breaſts.

1. That there is ſuch an overflowing Fountain of goodneſs and ſweetneſs in Jeſus Chriſt, that even thoſe who are not Believers may diſcern ſome ſweetneſs and excellency in him. 2. It aſſerts,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That there is a peculiar excellency and ſweetneſs in him diſcernable to the Believer, which others do not diſcern.</hi> The former is a truth. As a good woman may ſo far approve her ſelf to all that ſee her, or hear of her, that they may in heart admire her, and praiſe her, and have a general love for her; but yet this woman may to her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, in reſpect of her peculiar ſuitableneſs to him, and more immediate and intimate converſe with him, be ten thouſand times more precious in his Eyes, than unto others: So it is with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; a wicked man, who is far enough from ſaving Faith, or any ſpecial Intereſt in Chriſt, may yet have a general love for him. Give me leave alittle to enlarge upon this ſuppoſed part of the Propoſition. 1. <hi>By enquiring</hi> upon what bottom this general love can ſtand. 2. <hi>By making ſome Inferences from it.</hi> The grounds of it may be, 1. <hi>Real,</hi> or 2. <hi>Suppoſed and miſtaken.</hi> The truth is, ſuch is the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, ſuch a Fountain of ſweetneſs, that there is real ground for all the Sons of men to love him. I will hint you two or three.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt ſhall be, <hi>his humbling himſelf for the good of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</hi> The Evangeliſt ſaith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16. That <hi>God ſo loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, &amp;c. Arminians</hi> cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what the greateſt part in the World (as to the matter of Redemption) have to thank God for, if Chriſt were not given with equal reſpect to one as to another, or at leaſt (as others qualifie) to purchaſe a poſſibility for all: But certainly if one ſhould ſay, ſuch a one ſo loved ſuch a Family, that he gave his whole Eſtate to a <hi>Child</hi> of it, we might underſtand it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though every Member of the Family neither had, nor were in poſſibility to have part, and part like. It is very queſtionable whether the <hi>Angels</hi> ever ſhared in the death of Chriſt any way; yet I believe they love Chriſt for his dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for men: And to that end, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 10. the manifold Wiſdom of God is by the Church made known to them. <hi>Beneficence,</hi> or <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good to others,</hi> eſpecially ſuch as are in miſery, is a thing ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends it ſelf to the reaſon of man, that we cannot but have a love for ſuch as are bountiful, though we never taſt of their bounty. We ſee it in ordinary experience, if we that live here (be rational and ingenuous) hear that one who lives in the furtheſt parts of <hi>England</hi> hath given all his Eſtate to good uſes, though we have no ſhare in
<pb n="814" facs="tcp:61084:412"/>
them, yet we love the man for it. And certainly, if you could ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a reaſonable creature, who ſhould but hear that Chriſt, the Eternal Son of God, came down from Heaven, and died upon the Croſs, for ſome men, though he knew he were none of them, yet it would be a ground of love to him conſidered as a reaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, a ground of it may be, <hi>The certain apprehenſion of</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Reaſon.</note> 
                  <hi>ſome good which even the Unbeliever enjoyeth from Chriſt.</hi> It is ſaid by many, and thoſe too ſuch as can by no means agree, that Chriſt died equally for all, or that he purchaſed a poſſibility of Salvation for all; that yet there is none who lives, but is for his life and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation beholden to the death of Chriſt; and that all receive this good from him, which may to rational men evidence a ground of Love. I muſt confeſs I cannot too boldly ſtrike this ſtring, for I much doubt whether the ſtanding of the World, and the common preſervation of men, flows from the Death of Chriſt as the Iſſue of his purchaſe; I ſhould rather aſcribe it to the gracious Providence of God, of which even the Death of Chriſt alſo is an Iſſue.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Certain it is, that whatever the intention of Chriſt in dying was, ſuch is the Wiſdom of Divine Providence, <hi>That the Goſpel is held forth indefinitely; Whoſoever believeth ſhall be ſaved.</hi> So that there is no ground for any Soul to conclude, I was none of thoſe conſidered in the purchaſe of Chriſt, and there is ground ſufficient in the intrinſecal value and ſufficiency of the Death of Chriſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered together with the indefinite Propoſal of the Covenant of Grace, to encourage every man under hope of finding mercy with him, to come unto him. Now, which is there of us, that ſhould hear of a liberal man worth many thouſands of pounds, that ſhould have freely determined with himſelf to ſpend it all upon our Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſhould make a general offer to us, that to ſo many of us as would come to him, he would give a ſhare ſufficient, would not (as a reaſonable creature) judge himſelf engaged to love him, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſhould ſo go to him and receiveour ſhare? Give me leave only to infer two things from this Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That there is ſufficient ground for God to condemn thoſe for want of</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Corol. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>love to Chriſt, who yet never had a ſaving ſight of him.?</hi> All men deſerve to be <hi>Anathema Maranatha,</hi> whoſe hearts yern not toward Chriſt, whether ever they had any ſaving experience of the Love of Chriſt to their Souls, or no. I ſpeak but as a reaſonable creature. If I were ſure that I were ſhut out of Chriſt's thoughts when he
<pb n="815" facs="tcp:61084:412"/>
died upon the croſs, and that he would never ſave my Soul; yet I ſee reaſon enough why I ought to hate my ſelf, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn my ſelf if I ſhould not love him: I remember what the Jews ſaid for their Centurion: <hi>He hath loved our Nation and built us a Synagogue;</hi> this I am ſure of, Chriſt hath loved man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, he hath purchaſed ſalvation for ſome of them. O my Soul (if thou beeſt forgotten of God) yet love him, who would ſo far humble himſelf as to pity duſt and aſhes.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <note place="margin">Corol. 2.</note> 2. Hence ſecondly, No wonder <hi>if there be ſome love to Chriſt appearing in thoſe who have no ſhare nor intereſt in him.</hi> It hath been the aſſertion of ſome, that Common grace and ſpecial grace differ not <hi>ſpecifically</hi> but <hi>gradually.</hi> I think the aſſertion, amongſt underſtanding men but a conteſt of Logical terms; I no way doubt of the truth of this, <hi>That an unbeliever may love Chriſt in a ſenſe: But</hi> the Love of the Child of God vaſtly dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, being an <hi>infuſed habit</hi> and of another <hi>ſpecies.</hi> Whatſoever is preſented to us under the Notion of good, whether ſo really or apparently, is plainly the proper object of our love: Now ſuch may Chriſt appear even to an unbeliever, who is far from having taſted how good the Lord is; hence even in a carnal man there may be <hi>deſires after Chriſt,</hi> good wiſhes to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of Chriſt upon the Earth, yea and he may do much for the Service of Chriſt; either from a general Notion of Chriſts excellency, or 2dly (which I ſhould have mentioned before) <hi>from a ſuppoſal that he hath as good a ſhare, and intereſt in Chriſt, as any other,</hi> though in this (poſſibly) he may be miſtaken. And this is very uſeful for us to conſider, that we may not build too great confidences, from ſuch deſires, which we find in our Souls, or any ſuch external actions, without a due in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry after their Principle. But enough of this, I come to the poſitive part of the Propoſition.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> That there is a peculiar excellency in Chriſt, which the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Soul ſees and ſavours, and is not diſcernable to others. <hi>My beloved (ſaith the Spouſe) is</hi> a Cluſter of Camphire unto me. <hi>They ſaid to her in 5th of this Song,</hi> v. <hi>9.</hi> What is thy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved<note place="margin">Cant. 5. 9.</note> more then another beloved, O thou faireſt amongſt women? what is thy beloved more then anothers beloved that thou ſo ſtrictly chargeſt us? <hi>She anſwers,</hi> v. <hi>10.

               <p>To the firſt</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The believer ſees further into the heighths, and depths of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming love</hi> (in the general) then <hi>another man doth.</hi> The heighth of redeeming love is too great for a reaſonable man to take, the Aſtronomer is loſt at taking the heighth of this Star,<note place="margin">Eph. 3. 16, 17.</note> we muſt <hi>be ſtrengthned with might by the Spirit in the inward man, Chriſt</hi> muſt dwell <hi>in our hearts by ſaith,</hi> and we muſt be <hi>rooted, and grounded in love,</hi> before we ſhall <hi>be able with all Saints to comprehend, what is the breadth, length, and depth, and heighth, and know the Love of Chriſt which paſſeth knowledge.</hi> The unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever living under the light of the Goſpel is like the blind man, whoſe Eyes Chriſt hath once touched, and he ſeeth ſomething of he excellency of Chriſt, but alas! he <hi>ſeeth men like trees;</hi> Chriſt <hi>muſt touch him again</hi> before <hi>he ſees things clearly;</hi> the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever ſeeth Chriſt as another thing to what the unbeliever ſeeth.</p>

But it ſees them not ſo ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and clearly, as upon ſpecial ſaving illuminations, when the Spirit dealeth with the Soul, as it were by demonſtration, and gives it to ſee a Chriſt crucified as it were before its Eyes. There are two things eſpecially, which the Soul (upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion) doth doubtleſs ſee after a quite other manner then it ſaw them before converſion. 1. <hi>The ſinfulneſs and miſchief of ſin.</hi> A man meerly reaſonable may ſee the uglineſs, and ſinfulneſs of ſome ſins, (ſuch as are contrary to the light of nature, &amp;c.) A man Commonly enlightned may ſee more of the ſinfulneſs, and danger, both of theſe and of other ſins: but when the Spirit of God cometh ſavingly to work in the Soul, it ſeeth the ſinfulneſs, and danger even of theſe ſins, after another manner; ſin then becomes exceeding ſinful, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 13. It then thinks it ſees Hell fire before it, and is dropping into it, and ſo hath a clearer ſight of the danger of it. 2. The <hi>excellency of Chriſt,</hi> is doubtleſs ſeen by it too after another manner. Of this there needs no greater evidence than the Souls ſtrange workings of affections towards him, its groanings after him, longings for an intereſt in him, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>This proceeds alſo from the Souls union to Chriſt, and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of him.</hi> There are three waies by which the mind of man is united to its object, every one of which makes it more ſweet, then when it meerly contemplates it, and hath it in ſpeculation: one or all of which waies every believer is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="818" facs="tcp:61084:414"/>
1. <hi>The firſt is by hope.</hi> Suppoſe a man, hath in his Eye a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, and vertuous Woman: there's ſuch a proportion to his reaſonable nature, in her goodneſs and vertue, that ſhe is preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to him, and he puts a value upon her, though he never hopes to make her his Wife, but if he hath any ſuch grounded hope ſhe is much more precious to him: there's no gracious Soul, but is at leaſt thus far united to Chriſt, not only behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him as an excelling object, but poſſeſſed of a <hi>good hope through grace</hi> that this Chriſt is his Chriſt; now this muſt make him more ſweet then to another, who hath no ſuch hope.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But ſecondly: Suppoſe this man <hi>hath ſome aſſurance,</hi> that this vertuous Woman ſhall be his Wife, though it may be as yet they be only man and Wife before God, yet this union makes her more ſweet and precious to him: now this is the portion of many of Gods Children, they can ſay, <hi>my Beloved is mine and I am his;</hi> I am ſure the death of Chriſt is mine, the grace of Chriſt is mine, and the glory of Chriſt ſhall be mine, I ſhall ſee my Redeemer with theſe Eyes (as <hi>Job</hi> ſaid) how much more ſweet, muſt this aſſurance make Chriſt to his Soul, then to anothers, that can only ſay, there is a Saviour given to the World, but whether for my Soul, or no, I cannot tell.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Laſtly (to keep my ſimilitude ſtill) Suppoſe now the man that hath taken notice of a good and vertuous Woman in the World and hath formerly had hopes, to obtain her for his Wife, and promiſes, hath at laſt come to the enjoyment of her, and to experience the fruit of her vertues, in her good converſation with him, you will certainly ſay that to this man, this Woman is more ſweet then to all the World beſides, this is the caſe of every believing Soul. It hath had ſome experiences or other of the warmings, quickenings, ſtrengthenings, comfortings of his grace, and hence it is that Chriſt to <hi>this Soul,</hi> I ſay to this Soul more then to another, is a <hi>bundle of Myrrh,</hi> and a Cluſter of <hi>Copher.</hi> But I have inſiſted too long upon a truth, ſo far expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced by every gracious Soul.</p>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Qu.

He may not be <hi>ſweet to thee.</hi> There are two ſorts of Souls who ſavour very little of Chriſts ſweetneſs. 1. <hi>The Soul that lies under guilt of ſin;</hi> the thoughts of Chriſt to that Soul are ordinarily ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry terrible. 2. <hi>The Soul that is choaked with Worldly Incumbran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi> The freer the Soul can keep it ſelf, from diſtracting cares for the World, or from the renewing guilt of ſin, the ſweeter will the thoughts of Chriſt be unto it.

               <p>The believing Soul is a beautiful Soul; to the main of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, I have very lately ſpoken, when I ſpake to the compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, <hi>v.</hi> 8. where Chriſt had called her <hi>the faireſt among Women.</hi> I then diſcourſed the Nature of her <hi>beauty,</hi> and ſhewed you, 1. That it was not a corporeal but <hi>a Spiritual beauty,</hi> 2. Not <hi>a viſible but an inviſible beauty,</hi> 3. <hi>Not a Native but an adventitious beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> 4. Not <hi>an artificial, but a created beauty,</hi> 5. Not <hi>an adherent beauty only but an inherent beauty alſo,</hi> 6. A <hi>deſirable beauty,</hi> 7. <hi>A durable beauty,</hi> 8. <hi>Not a perfect beauty.</hi> And having ſpoken ſo fully to it there (where alſo the ſame word is uſed) I intend not to repeat it here, only I ſhall take notice of ſome cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, by which the Propoſition is advantaged in this Text. And</p>
               <p>They are four or five, 1. <hi>He had told her before,</hi> She was the <hi>faireſt amongſt Women.</hi> Not ſatisfied with that he repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his Love to her again, and telleth her ſhe is fair, ſhe is fair.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Soul had been commending Chriſt, that he was as a <hi>bundle of Myrrh, as a Cluſter of Camphire</hi> to her; Chriſt upon her expreſſing affection to him replies, <hi>Behold thou art fair,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3. When he calls her</hi> Fair <hi>he adds,</hi> My Love; Thou art fair my Love.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is not barely expreſt, <hi>Thou art fair,</hi> but here is an <hi>Ecce</hi> prefixed; <hi>Behold</hi> thou art fair.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Laſtly, He doth not ſpeak it <hi>ſingly;</hi> But he doubles his words; <hi>Thou art fair, Thou art fair,</hi> and the term <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,</hi> is repeated too, <hi>Behold! thou art fair; Behold! Thou art fair.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here is none of theſe five circumſtances, but will afford us a meditation, which will be either informative, or ſweet, or profitable to us. Give me leave therefore to ſpeak a word to each of them.</p>

                  <pb n="823" facs="tcp:61084:416"/>
                  <hi>it,</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) <hi>that Power belongs unto God.</hi> There is many a Soul that can ſay, Once hath God ſpoken, yea twice have I heard it, that the <hi>Love of God belongs to me.</hi> There is many a Chriſtian that can ſay, In ſuch an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance I heard God ſpeaking peace, at ſuch a time I found this <hi>Spirit witneſſing with my Spirit</hi> that I was his Child. Chriſt in this conſulteth, 1. His <hi>Peoples infirmities;</hi> 2. <hi>His own glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Chriſt I ſay in this thing conſulteth, 1. <hi>His Peoples infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.</hi> They are many which make them need this; two chiefly.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Believers Soul is dull of hearing.</hi> The Apoſtle charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Hebrews, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 11. That they were <hi>dull</hi> of <hi>hearing,</hi> which made the repeating fundamental truths neceſſary for them—There's nothing in the World, that a gracious heart would more gladly hear then this, <hi>that it is fair in the Eyes of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and yet nothing that it is more dull to hear: the reaſon is becauſe <hi>it ſo eagerly deſires it,</hi> and prizeth it ſo highly, that it cries out, <hi>It is too good news to be true.</hi> You ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in the World a double diſpoſition in men: ſome are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed almoſt wholly to fear, others to over much confidence. Hence at ſuch a time of changes in the ſtate as this is, one man (be a thing never ſo true, and to his mind, yet) he hardly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, he is naturally diſpoſed to fear the worſt. Other men, let things be never ſo improbable yet they will hope, and talk as confidently as if the thing they would have were done. It is much from their natural temper, they are diſpoſed to confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, &amp;c. Take now an unbelieving natural man, and he is diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to bleſs himſelf and hope well of his condition, you have his copy, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 19, 20. <hi>He ſaith, I ſhall have peace, though I walk according to the imagination of my heart,</hi> &amp;c. But now take a believing Soul, and he is <hi>very dull of hearing words of peace.</hi> Tell him news of the wrath of God revealing againſt the Children of diſobedience he eaſily believes it, and tells you he feels it in his Conſcience, he is one of them deſigned to this wrath. The terrors of God have been upon his Soul and (like an affrighted man) he is very prone to ſhake, at any repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of what he hath found ſo terrible to him. But let a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Chriſt tell him, <hi>thy iniquities are pardoned,</hi> Chriſt is at the door of thy Soul, it is Such improbable news to his affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Soul, ſuch a ſtrange thing, that he ſhould be pardoned, and
<pb n="824" facs="tcp:61084:417"/>
ſuch a ſinner received to mercy, that he is like the Chriſtians met, <hi>Acts</hi> 12. to pray for <hi>Peter,</hi> when the Maid brought in word that <hi>Peter</hi> was at the gate, they ſay unto her, <hi>thou art mad:</hi> And when ſhe ſtands to her word, they will believe no more then <hi>that it was his Angel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A gracious Soul eſpecially when it comes firſt to believe, is ready to ſay to it ſelf, Surely I <hi>am mad</hi> to think that Chriſt ſhould account me fair, pardon my ſins, &amp;c. Now Chriſt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating peace, conſulteth this infirmity in us: as I remember<note place="margin">Judg. 12. 3.</note> he did with <hi>Manoah, Jud.</hi> 12. <hi>Manoah's Wife</hi> had been barren, God ſends an Angel to her to tell her ſhe ſhould conceive a Son, &amp;c. <hi>v.</hi> 6, 7. <hi>Manoah's</hi> Wife tells her Husband (you muſt think there was nothing in the World theſe two deſired more then a Son.) But it ſeemed too good news to be true and therefore, <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>Manoah,</hi> goes and Prays, <hi>O Lord let the man of God which thou didſt ſend to us come again to us,</hi> indeed the reaſon of his deſire which he aſſigns is to direct him how to <hi>order his Son:</hi> but certainly <hi>Manoah</hi> thought the news too good to be true: and God ſo far yeilds to <hi>Manoah's infirmity,</hi> as to ſend his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel the ſecond time,</p>
               <p n="2">2. As the believing Soul is <hi>dull of hearing Chriſt at firſt ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>

                  <hi>peace to</hi> it, and is like to <hi>Samuel</hi> when <hi>Eli</hi> called, and cannot apprehend Gods voice: So it is <hi>alſo very prone to forget the words of peace which God ſpeaketh to it.</hi> Of all the joys which we are in this life capable of, theſe are the greateſt, and none ſo ſoon loſt as theſe are, ſo incertain is the ſtate of the Children of God. <hi>In many things we offend,</hi> and even <hi>the righteous man ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth ſeven times in a day,</hi> and who can tell how often he offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth? Now every ſin in its own nature is a breach of our peace with God, and gives the watchful Soul occaſion of doubting, whether it did not at firſt miſtake the voice of God, or whether God hath not changed his mind towards it: and hence in the ſecond place God highly conſults our infirmities, in doubling his <hi>words of peace</hi> upon us and repeating them unto us. Chriſt had told <hi>Peter, Thou art</hi> Peter, <hi>and upon this rock will I build my Church,</hi> but when <hi>Peter</hi> had denied his Maſter Chriſt eaſily fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing, that <hi>Peters</hi> thoughts would be much troubled, and that he would be ready to forget all his former evidences of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour:<note place="margin">Mark 16. 7.</note> orders his Angel, <hi>Mar.</hi> 16. 7.

Love is of an obliging nature, and there is no Soul that puts on ſo lively for God, as that Soul that hath the moſt freſh and frequent manifeſtations of Divine Love to it. <hi>David</hi>'s Inſtance in the 118 <hi>Pſalm,</hi> is a full Evidence of this. And this is the account that may be given why it pleaſeth the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to repeat his Love ſo frequently unto the Souls of Believers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But I hear ſome gracious Souls ſaying, <hi>Bleſſed are they that are in ſuch a caſe,</hi> who hear God ſpeaking Love to their Souls, and often repeating his Love to them: But alas! we are ſo far from this, that we could never yet hear Chriſt ſpeaking any ſuch thing to our Souls; we could never yet hear Chriſt ſo much asonce ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Behold thou art fair my Love,</hi> &amp;c. What will you ſay to us? Shall we hope that we are the Spouſes of Chriſt, who never yet could obtain one good look from him? I anſwer;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. As it is not the Husband's fond and affectionate expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to his Wife, which make, or alone evidence her to be his Wife, but <hi>the Marriage-covenant is that which doth it;</hi> her conſent to have him to be her wedded Husband, and his conſent to have her to be his Wife So, it is not a <hi>word of peace,</hi> ſealed to the Soul which maketh the Soul, or which alone evidenceth the Soul to be the Spouſe of Chriſt: No, it is the Marriage-covenant, it is the Soul's conſent to have Chriſt for its Saviour, for its Husband. Though Chriſt hath not ſaid it in thy hearing, <hi>Thou art fair my Love, thou art fair,</hi> yet if the Soul can ſay, and ſay it in truth, that it hath accepted Chriſt as its Saviour, and conſented to Chriſt as its Husband, there's no cauſe of deſpondency, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 7. <hi>We walk by faith, not by ſight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Though the Lord be pleaſed thus to ſpeak his Love in the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſome Souls, and again to repeat it to them;</hi> yet he is pleaſed to <hi>reſerve himſelf more from ſome who are equally dear to him.</hi> It may be the indulgent Father loves every Child he hath with a dear and tender love, and doth deſign to give them all due proportions of his Eſtate, yet he may carry himſelf <hi>more ſtrangely</hi> and reſervedly to ſome than unto others: Poſſibly he may do it out of <hi>prudence,</hi> as knowing it the beſt way in order to their good: Poſſibly no other account can be given of it, than a meer <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="826" facs="tcp:61084:418"/>
thy Soul ſo clearly as upon anothers: Poſſibly no other account can be given of it, but becauſe he will do it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Take heed thy looſe walking with God be not the cauſe of it.</hi> When ever Chriſt ſpeaks to the Soul, he will ſpeak truth, if thou beeſt all foul, and ſpotted, he will not ſay to the, <hi>behold thou art fair my Love, behold thou art fair.</hi> The Soul may have many fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, many ſpots upon its face, and yet be <hi>fair</hi> in the Eyes of Chriſt, fair as to its Juſtification: But Chriſt will not ſay to ſuch a Soul, <hi>Behold thou art fair.</hi> The Father or prudent Mother, may dearly love a diſingenuous and rebellious Child. But their prudence will keep them from commending ſuch a Child, and from expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing exuberant affection to it, leſt the Child by it take advantage to go on in courſes of diſobedience. Chriſt dearly loves many a poor Soul that hath its wanton tricks, and is full of failings, but he will not ſay to ſuch a Soul, <hi>Behold thou art fair my Love.</hi> I will add but one thing more.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Laſtly; Poſſibly Chriſt hath ſpoke, and ſpoke it to thee often, <hi>Behold thou art fair my Love, Behold thou art fair, but thou haſt not heard him.</hi> I have already told you that many of God's People are very <hi>deaf of that Ear.</hi> I was about to ſay, there is no better ſign of a gracious Soul, than not to be too ready to hear ſuch meſſages of peace. God ſometimes ſpeaks ſo as the Soul cannot but hear, when he pleaſeth to ſet the <hi>Broad Seal</hi> of his Spirit unto the poor Soul; this indeed is an audible voice, and diſtinguiſhable enough. But God in every Sermon ſpeaks to the Believer, <hi>Thou art fair my Love, thou art fair.</hi> We never Preach thoſe great Truths of God, <hi>That whoſoever believes ſhall be ſaved, and whoſoever is juſtified by Faith, hath peace with God,</hi> and ſuch like; but God to every Believer that hears us ſpeak, <hi>Thou art fair my Love, thou art fair.</hi> But alas! not one of many hath an Ear to hear, no not thoſe who truly believe. It is in this caſe as with <hi>Samuel,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 4, 5. <hi>Samuel</hi> was young, and had not been uſed to the voice of God; God calls him once, away he goes to <hi>Eli;</hi> the Lord calls a ſecond time, <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> runs to <hi>Eli</hi> again, and ſo a third time, till <hi>Eli</hi> inſtructed and aſſured him it was the voice of God. Till the Spirit of God brings the voice of God in the Goſpel to the Ear, to the inward Ear of a Chriſtian, he will not underſtand God ſpeaking peace to him, when indeed he doth ſpeak it. In very deed it is for want of Spiritual Logick. The Word of God hath the Propoſition. He that believes is fair: <hi>Though a man hath been a Thief, a Drunkard, a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous</hi>
                  <pb n="827" facs="tcp:61084:418"/>
                  <hi>perſon, &amp;c. yet, if he be waſhed, if he be juſtified, if he be ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified in the Name of our God, and through the Spirit of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, he is fair.</hi> Thus much is plain in the Word, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 11. But now when the Soul ſhould come to aſſume,—<hi>But I am waſhed, I am juſtified, I am ſanctified;</hi> there it fails; and theſe may be the Reaſons of a gracious Soul's complaint in this caſe. But I have ſpoke enough to the firſt of the five Circumſtances which I mentioned, I proceed now to a ſecond.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2 Circumſt.</note> The Spouſe had been admiring Chriſt, comparing him <hi>to a bundle of Myrrh, to a cluſter of Camphire, or Copher.</hi> Now Chriſt adds, Behold thou <hi>art fair my Love;</hi> Behold <hi>thou art fair.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> High out-goings of a Soul toward Chriſt; are ordinarily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of great returns of the Love of Chriſt upon the Soul.</p>
               <p>Duty in us is not the Father of Grace, for who hath given firſt unto God, and it ſhall be repaid to him again? but extraordinary influences of Grace, are commonly the wages of great duty. It is very ſeldom that any Soul lets Chriſt know that he is exceeding dear to it, but (by the next Poſt) the Soul ſhall know that it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dear to Chriſt. Doth God hear <hi>Ephraim</hi> bemoaning himſelf thus? <hi>Thou haſt chaſtiſed me, and I was chastiſed, as a Bullock unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed</hi>

Is he a pleaſant Child? for ſince I ſpake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, I do earneſtly remember him ſtill, therefore my bowels are troubled for him I will ſurely have mercy upon him, ſaith the Lord.</hi> Is the Spouſe <hi>ſick of love?</hi> Cant. 5. 8. <hi>Doth ſhe indeed think</hi>

I might inſtance in many Texts of Scripture, but I forbear. Will you know the reaſon of this? Take it. 1. <hi>Negatively,</hi> 2. <hi>Poſitively.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Negatively;</hi> It is not becauſe <hi>there's any merit in duty.</hi> Chriſt is no Merchant of Grace, he gives it, but he ſells it not. Indeed it is a contradiction to ſpeak of <hi>meritorious duty;</hi> if it be duty, it is the payment of a debt on our part, and can be no purchaſe-mony. The compaſs of that Commandment, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and all thy Soul, and with all thy ſtrength, is of an exceeding latitude;</hi> there's no finiſhing of it by any creature in this life. It was from the jejune Interpretation that the Phariſees of old, and the Papiſts of late, have put upon the Law of God, that
<pb n="828" facs="tcp:61084:419"/>
they ever dreamt that man was able to perform it, much leſs do any thing of ſupererogation. The foundation-ſtone of man's Salvation is laid in Grace, and the top-ſtone is Grace too: To the whole Building you muſt cry, <hi>Grace, Grace.</hi> But Poſitively</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is <hi>from the overflowings of Divine Grace in him who is our Fountain-head the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The Eye that weeps for its ſin, till it can weep no more, doth not by its tears make it ſelf an Handkerchief to dry its Eyes, but a tender-hearted Saviour moved from his own bowels cannot but afford it one, and ſay unto it why weepeſt thou? The Soul, that for Chriſts ſake parts with Father Mother, Children, Brethren, Siſters, all, doth not by this purchaſe to it ſelf peace of Conſcience or eternal life (Alas! what proportion is there betwixt things temporal, and ſuch as are Spiritual and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal?) But he who hath both theſe to give, gives them upon the Souls performing its duty in this particular, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 29. The Soul that caſts up many a long look to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and earneſtly wiſheth for his preſence with it, and valueth it above the World, and ſeeks for it more then for Gold, or hid treaſure, doth not by this earn Chriſts Love to it, but Chriſt from the fulneſs of his grace makes choice of this Soul, to reveal himſelf unto. The<note place="margin">Iſa. 30. 18.</note> Prophet, <hi>Iſaiah Ch.</hi> 30. <hi>v.</hi> 18. hath ſuch an expreſſion as this; <hi>The Lord will wait that he may be gracious unto you:</hi> Chriſt is a <hi>fountain of Grace;</hi> a full fountain: now when the fountain is brim full of water, the water waiteth for an opportunity to diffuſe it ſelf: it may be there is a bank that hinders the full river, that it cannot diffuſe its water, the water therefore works ſecretly and ſoftens the bank firſt till a breach be made, and then it emptieth it ſelf by it. Chriſt is a ſea, a full ſea of Grace, but ſinful man caſts up a bank, againſt this ſea, a bank of <hi>unbelief:</hi> A bank of <hi>ſtone</hi> (hardning his heart) a bank of <hi>earth,</hi> (favouring an earthly mind) a bank of <hi>mud,</hi> delights in ſenſual luſts and objects; Chriſt now cannot ſhew his grace to ſuch a Soul, the bank hinders; where he pleaſeth indeed he worketh ſecretly, takes away the heart of ſtone, and makes it an heart of fleſh, takes away <hi>unbelief,</hi> vanity, earthly mindedneſs, ſenſual affections, and then he emptyeth the treaſuries of grace upon the Soul.

Let me ask

thee, who thus complaineſt this queſtion, Did Chriſt ever yet hear thee ſay, <hi>as a bundle of Myrrh is my beloved unto me, he ſhall lye all night betwixt my breaſts?</hi> Haſt thou ſerved Chriſt with Ordinary expreſſions of duty? How canſt thou expect to be feaſted by him with extraordinary returns of mercy? If thy breathings after him have been faint, and ſhort, what reaſon haſt thou to expect, that his breathings ſhould be ſo full upon thee? He is indeed a full ocean of free grace, but it may be thou haſt caſt up a bank againſt him: it may be thou haſt clogg'd him with an hard heart, and unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heart, a vain heart, a filthy ſenſual heart: Wonder not, O Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian! that he is ſo little towards thee in a way of mercy, if thou beeſt ſcant towards him in thy way of duty. There is a generation of men and women in the world, who are taken notice of to behave themſelves as if they thought that all the World were made to ſerve them, and they not made to ſerve any (but they are an unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable generation, and ſober perſons ſo account of them, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly ſlight them.)

Behold thou art fair,</hi> now in this life, while thou art <hi>black</hi> with infirmities, and corruptions, black through affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and temptations, yet even now thou art fair, 1 <hi>Joh</hi> 3. 2.<note place="margin">1 Joh. 3. 2.</note> Beloved, <hi>Now we are the Sons of God. It doth not yet appear what we ſhall be.</hi> This particle is often thus uſed in holy Writ. <hi>Gen.</hi> 29. 2, 25. and it is capable enough of this ſenſe in this Text. <hi>Behold thou art fair,</hi> thou ſhalt not only be hereafter <hi>beautiful,</hi> when the Crown of glory ſhall be ſet upon thy head, but thou art now beautiful, thou doeſt not apprehend thy ſelf ſo, thou art bewailing thy ſpots, and thy infirmities, but I look upon thee as fair, with all thy ſpots, I look upon thee as beautiful even now.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It denotes the <hi>certainty of a thing.</hi> Behold is a particle of <hi>Demonſtration,</hi> and is often ſo uſed in Scripture. There is nothing more certain, then what we can <hi>behold.</hi> Thus the particle is uſed, Gen. 16. 2. <hi>Behold now the Lord hath reſtrained me from bearing</hi> (they are the words of <hi>Sarah)</hi> that is, the Lord hath
<pb n="833" facs="tcp:61084:421"/>
                  <hi>certainly</hi> reſtrained me; ſee <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 27. The believing Soul is (certainly) a beauteous Soul. The Beauty of that Soul which truly believes in Jeſus Chriſt is not an <hi>imaginary thing,</hi> it is a true, and real thing, it is a <hi>certainty</hi>'s <hi>Behold thou art fair,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Laſtly this particle <hi>Behold</hi> doth very often denote <hi>eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> and <hi>excellency.</hi> When ſomething is <hi>wonderful in Nature or</hi> otherwiſe, the Scripture uſeth to make mention of it, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixing this particle <hi>Behold</hi> to it. So <hi>James</hi> 3. 3, 4. It is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful thing, that the ſtrength of an Horſe ſhould be ruled by a bit, and that ſo great a <hi>bulk</hi> as a ſhip, driven about with fierce winds, ſhould be turned about with a very ſmall helm; and thus it is a very often uſed in Scripture, and it may have that uſe here. <hi>Behold thou art fair (My Love!) Behold thou art fair;</hi> and ſo it may hint to us theſe two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That the beauty of a believer is no ordinary beauty, but a rare, and eminent, beauty,</hi> not like the beauty of Woman, not like that vain thing which we call <hi>beauty</hi> in a natural fenſe which is only the object of the luſt of the Eye: no, it is a <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual beauty,</hi> which age will not deface, diſeaſes will not ſpoil, no outward accidents will hurt; a beauty that is not expoſed to wind, and weather. The Kings Daughter is <hi>all glorious within<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and yet ſo great is her glory, that the King of Kings deſires her beauty. Or ſecondly it may denote this,</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That it is a wonderful thing, that Chriſt ſhould account a Child of</hi> Adam, <hi>a poor believing Soul beauteous.</hi> When <hi>David</hi> conſidered the Heavens and the Earth, he cries out, <hi>What is man</hi> (O Lord!) <hi>that thou ſhouldeſt remember him;</hi> or the Son of man that thou ſhouldeſt be mindful of him? It is a matter of high admiration to any ingenuous Soul to ſit down and think, that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould account it beautiful. But I haſten to the laſt Circumſtance.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">5 Circumſt.</note> I obſerved to you that the phraſe is doubled: Chriſt doth not only ſay, <hi>thou art fair</hi> (my Love) but he doubles the phraſe, <hi>Thou art fair, thou art fair.</hi> There is doubtleſs nothing ſuperfluous in holy Writ, though poſſibly there may be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing both in the matter, and ſtile, of which we can give no Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory account: almoſt in all languages theſe repetitions and reduplications of words and phraſes are uſual. The <hi>Hebr.</hi> is very full of them; they are of ſeveral uſes. I ſhall note ſuch of them as may be properly applied to this Text.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="834" facs="tcp:61084:422"/>
1. Sometimes <hi>the doubling of a word or phraſe denotes the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the thing, or action,</hi> Gen. 15. 13. <hi>Know of a ſurety,</hi> thy ſeed ſhall be a ſtranger, &amp;c. In the Heb. it is, <hi>knowing thou mayeſt know.</hi> And thus frequently in the new Teſtament, <hi>verily verily,</hi> denotes the exceeding certainty of the Propoſition ſpoken, and thus it may do in this Text, <hi>thou art fair</hi> my Love, <hi>thou art fair:</hi> That is, thou art certainly very fair.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Sometimes it is to note the exceeding <hi>earneſtneſs</hi> and <hi>intention</hi> of <hi>him who ſpeaketh. Bis dictum magis dicitur.</hi> Thus it is often uſed in Scripture, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. 10. <hi>The valley of</hi> Siddim <hi>was full of ſlimepits,</hi> (ſo we tranſlate it) in the <hi>Hebr.</hi> A valley <hi>of pits of pits.</hi> So in many Texts: other Writers, amongſt whom <hi>Julius Scaliger,</hi> &amp;c. much Commend this form of ſpeaking, as having in it a great kind of force and vehemency: accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this uſage, the ſenſe is, <hi>thou art exceeding ſair my Love,</hi> which comporteth, with what he had ſaid before, <hi>v.</hi> 8. where he had called the Spouſe, <hi>thou ſaireſt amongſt Women. Chriſt hath his delight amongſt the Sons of men.</hi> He takes no ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the Angels as in believers.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Repetitions (thirdly) of the ſame word or phraſe, in<note place="margin">Numb. 1. Exod. 26.</note> Scripture <hi>ſometimes note a diſtribution.</hi> And ſo the ſenſe may be this, <hi>thou art fair</hi> my Love, <hi>thou art fair; Thou art juſtified by my grace,</hi> and ſo thou art fair; <hi>thou art Sanctified in my name,</hi> ſo thou art fair; thou art fair without and thou art fair within, thou art fair in this part, and fair in that part, fair in every part.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Laſtly (to mention no more) Repetltions are often uſed by Orators not only to expreſs a <hi>vehemency of intention, in him that ſpeaketh, and the certainty of the thing that is ſpoken, but to beget a vehemency, and earneſtneſs of attention in him that hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</hi> and Interpreters of holy Writ do aſſign this as one reaſon of the uſe of them in ſeveral places of Scripture, when the Holy-Ghoſt deſigneth earneſtly to inculcate the thing ſpoken, and to beget in us a belief of it: hence now we may learn theſe things which I will but name, and conclude what I have to ſay from the conſideration of the Circumſtances of the firſt Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Text.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>beauty of a believing Soul is unqueſtionable,</hi> it is not in a complement that Chriſt ſaith the believing Soul is beautiful: it is not a ſeeming beauty, but a certain beauty.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="835" facs="tcp:61084:422"/>
2. <hi>The beauty which grace gives the Soul is an eminent beauty,</hi> not an ordinary, but an eminent beauty. The phraſe is doubled to denote eminency.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Beauty of a believing Soul is a <hi>manifold beauty:</hi> A beauty in every part.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>It is the will of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that a believing Soul ſhould know, and believe it ſelf to be a beauteous Soul.</hi> A Gracious Soul may debaſe it ſelf too much, and often err as much in having too mean thoughts of it ſelf, as the hypocrite doth in having too high thoughts of himſelf, thinking of himſelf above what be ought to think.</p>
               <p>But I intend not to enlarge a diſcourſe upon theſe things, having ſpoken to them, or at leaſt to ſome of them before, thus much is ſufficient to have noted concerning the Circumſtances; I proceed to the ſecond part of the Text, <hi>Thou haſt Doves Eyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Prop.</note> The Propoſition of this Text is plain enough. <hi>The true Spouſe of Chriſt hath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Doves Eyes.</hi> I before obſerved to you, that ſome read it, thy Eyes are like the Eyes of a Dove: others thy Eyes are as a pair of Doves: but as the difference is not much, ſo I ſee no reaſon to deviate from our Engliſh tranſlation. For the explication and confirmation of the Propoſition (for I will join both together) we will enquire theſe three things.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> Qu. Why Our Saviour in commending his Spouſe begins with her Eyes, <hi>and only Commends her for them?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> Qu. What is here meant by the Spouſes Eyes?</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3.</hi> Qu. Why the Spouſe is ſaid to have the Eyes of Doves rather then of any other creature?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>1.</hi> Qu. Why doth our Saviour, here Commend the Spouſe only for her Eyes?</p>
               <p n="1">1. The general account which Interpreters give of it, is this; That it is a <hi>Synechdoche,</hi> and by a figure, according to which a conſiderable part is often put for the whole; our Saviour doth here ſpeak his whole Spouſe to be like a Dove, like a <hi>Doves Eye.</hi> Indeed we are commanded to be harmleſs as Doves, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 16. And the Church is called Gods <hi>Turtle Dove, Pſal.</hi> 74. 19. And <hi>David</hi> wiſheth that he had the <hi>wings of a Dove, Pſal.</hi> 55. 6. The ſhape of a <hi>Dove</hi> was that ſhape which the Spirit of God choſe, when it deſcended upon Chriſt: And the coming in of the Gentiles to Chriſt is ſet out by the flockings of <hi>Doves</hi>
                  <pb n="836" facs="tcp:61084:423"/>
                  <hi>to the Windows, Iſa.</hi> 60. 8. And the Eye (of all the members) is the moſt conſiderable as to beauty, a good Eye much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth an ill complexion, and a bad Eye much blemiſheth any other Symmetry of parts. And this may be allowed for one reaſon. But,</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Soul doth much diſcover it ſelf at the Eye.</hi> It is the caſement at which it ſhews it ſelf: many of the Vertues, and Vices of the mind are read in the Eye; <hi>wantonneſs</hi> diſcovers it ſelf at the Eye: hence you read in Scripture of <hi>Eyes full of adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,</hi> 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 14. So doth <hi>rage, pride, malice, envy</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other vices, and as the evil, ſo the good diſpoſitions and vertues of the Soul, are much diſcovered by the Eye too: ſo that indeed when our Saviour commendeth his Spouſe for her <hi>Eyes,</hi> he commendeth her whole <hi>Soul,</hi> and it is but a proof of what he had before ſaid, <hi>Thou art fair my beloved, thou art fair.</hi> Thou haſt Doves Eyes, proves that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2.</hi> Qu. What is here meant by the Spouſes Eyes?</p>
               <p>After ſuch a reſolution, as I gave to the firſt queſtion, this might ſeem needleſs, if Interpreters had not led me the way, who are in doubt whether our Saviours deſign here be to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend thoſe bodily parts of his Spouſe: or ſome <hi>inward parts,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Eyes</hi> by a Metaphor; the difference is not much, for ſuppoſing him to reſemble the Eyes of her body to <hi>Doves Eyes,</hi> the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is becauſe of thoſe gracious diſpoſitions in her Soul, which by her Eyes diſcover themſelves, and are like the natural incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of Doves; if he ſpeaks of the <hi>Eyes of her mind,</hi> and his meaning be that his Spouſes <hi>underſtanding</hi> (which is the Eye of the Soul) is like <hi>a Doves Eyes,</hi> the thing is much the ſame, Unqueſtionably, that which our Saviour here deſigns to Commend believers for is, the gracious diſpoſitions of their Souls diſcovered in their outward converſation, much reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, the natural diſpoſitions and behaviours of Doves. But the chief thing we have to enquire into for the full underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Saviours meaning in this Text, is,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3</hi> Qu. What theſe rare and remarkable properties are in Doves, or in the Eyes of Doves more then in other creatures, for which our Saviour reſembleth his Spouſe to them, either to ſhew us what true believers are, or ought to be?</p>
               <p>The Dove is a creature ſufficiently known to us; a creature which of old God made uſe of in Sacrifices, rejecting others.
<pb n="837" facs="tcp:61084:423"/>
It was the creature ſent out of the Ark by <hi>Noah,</hi> which brought the olive branch. Naturaliſts obſerve many remarkable things of the Dove. Give me leave to open to you, the aptneſs of the ſimilitude in nine or ten particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Doves Eyes are <hi>meek and harmleſs Eyes.</hi> Hence Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſts obſerve that the Dove preſently forgets an injury, and builds her neſt and lays her eggs, and hatcheth her young, where her neſt was newly deſtroyed, and her young ones taken away, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 16. <hi>Be harmleſs as Doves.</hi> The cruelty and revenge of the mind is much ſeen in the Eye, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 6. you read of him that hath an <hi>evil Eye:</hi> there is a <hi>bewitching Eye</hi> and a <hi>flaming ſparkling Eye;</hi> in which you may ſee the ſparks of that rage, and envy, and anger, which flame in the Soul, you may read rapine, and cruelty, and miſchief, in an Hawks Eye, but in a Doves Eye nothing but meekneſs: the old verſe ſaith,</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Felle <hi>Columba caret,</hi> roſtro non-laedit, &amp; ungues</l>
                  <l>Poſſidet innocuos—</l>
               </q>
               <p>A Dove wants gall, and though it hath nails and claws, yet it gripes none with them. The Dove doth not wholly want gall, but Naturaliſts ſay, it hath but very little (compared with other creatures;) and hence it is, that it is very gentle, peaceable, fearful, and doth no other bird hurt: Believers are compared to <hi>Sheep,</hi> and to <hi>Doves.</hi> Sheep have horns, but they hurt none with them: Doves have claws, but they hurt none with them: and (as I faid before) this may be read in their Eyes in which you do not ſee ſuch a ſharpneſs, and ſparkling as it were of fire, as in the Eyes of birds of prey: Believers<note place="margin">Mat. 10. 16.</note> have, or ſhould have Doves Eyes: <hi>Samuel</hi> is able to ſtand up and ſay, <hi>whoſe Ox have I taken? Or whoſe Aſs have I taken? Or whom have I defrauded:</hi> Our Saviour commands us that we ſhould<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 20.</note> be innocent as Doves; in malice they are Children, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. it is the Apoſtles Command, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4 31. <hi>Let all bitterneſs, and</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 31.</note> 
                  <hi>wrath, &amp; anger, and clamour, and evil ſpeaking be put away from you with all malice.</hi> Believers when <hi>unregenerate lived in malice, and</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Titus 3. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>envy, hateful, and hating one another,</hi> Tit. 3. 3. But, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 8.<note place="margin">Col. 3. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>They have put off all theſe, anger, wrath, malice,</hi> &amp;c. And it is their buſineſs to be ſtill laying them aſide: every true Believer hath ſomething of a Doves Eye, and it is his work to be daily getting his heart up to it more and more.</p>

2. <hi>A Doves Eye</hi> ſecondly, is a <hi>ſatisfied Eye.</hi> The ſatisfaction of the ſenſible and reaſonable Soul, is much diſcerned in the Eye.

               <p n="3">3. <hi>The Dove's Eye is a Benign Eye.</hi> You do not only not diſcern any thing of rage and fury, or cruelty, and greedineſs in a Dove's Eye; but you diſcern a certain <hi>kindneſs,</hi> and (as it were) <hi>a good will in it:</hi> Hence it is very friendly amongſt its fellows, and it loves an habitation near dwelling-houſes of men.

Grace takes away that curriſhneſs and doggedneſs, which makes men rugged in their ſpeeches and behaviour, and churliſh in their ſpirits; and if ought of this remains upon their hearts, it is becauſe their Faith is but in part, and they have yet a body of death, ſome unmortified corruption that yet remains in them, which is in the fault; for Grace is of a benign, kind nature; the Believer hath <hi>Doves Eyes.</hi> Look as it is with a Dove; let a Cock be feeding, that's a churliſh creature, and will endure none to be near it: The Dove is kind, and allows room to all commers; ſuch a kindneſs there is now in a Believer's heart, where Grace hath taken its full hold.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Doves Eyes are lowly Eyes.</hi> The pride and haughtineſs of the Natural diſpoſition, both in ſenſible and rational creatures, is much ſeen in the Eyes: You diſcern a proud and lofty Bird by the ſurli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

               <p n="7">7. Doves Eyes are <hi>fearful, tender Eyes;</hi> this experience teacheth, and Naturaliſts ſay, That it is cauſed by the little proportion of Gall that is in them: There is not in them indeed ſuch a ſhineſs and fearfulneſs as is in ſome other Birds, becauſe they are (many of them) nurſed up near to houſes, and made familiar to men, but it is evident they are <hi>trembling creatures.</hi> The Spouſe of Chriſt hath (upon this account) <hi>Doves Eyes.</hi> It is true, he hath not the fear of a reprobate upon him; he is more acquainted with God, and hath been bred up in nigher communion with God; yet he is very ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to fear; he <hi>fears ſinning againſt God,</hi> and God cannot lay an hand upon him, but he is ready to tremble; he cannot caſt an Eye upon any Judgment of God, but he ſhakes at the apprehenſion of an angry God in it: He hath Doves Eyes.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>The Dove's Eye is a mournful Eye.</hi> Hence in Scripture the mourning of Doves is made uſe of to expreſs ſad mournings, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38. <hi>v.</hi> 14, <hi>I did mourn like a Dove, Iſa.</hi> 59. 11. <hi>We mourn ſore like Doves.</hi> I conceive it chiefly relates to the <hi>mourning of Turtles.</hi> The Saints Eyes too are <hi>mourning Eyes;</hi> they are perſons of ſorrowful ſpirits, broken and contrite ſpirits; and look as it is with Turtles, they never mourn ſo bitterly, as when they have loſt their Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; ſo it is with the Believer; he never ſo mourneth, as under the withdrawings of Divine Love. It is not proper for the Children of the Bridechamber to mourn while the Bridegroom is with them, but when he is gone, <hi>Then they ſhall mourn.</hi>

               <p n="10">10. <hi>The Doves Eyes are quick Eyes.</hi> Naturaliſts obſerve, that the flight of the Dove is very ſwift, ſo ſwift, that when they flie direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forward, no Hawk can take it; and for this quickneſs of flight, quickneſs of the Eye is neceſſary. The Spouſe of Chriſt is quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſighted too; its Eye immediately pierceth through a miſt of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and dangers; he believeth in hope againſt hope: When he doth not ſee by the Eye of Senſe, yet he believeth: He hath Doves Eyes.</p>

I know no more certain character of one that is a ſtranger to Chriſt than this; Let me ſee one that is full of cruelty, (wanting tenderneſs of heart) malice, and revenge, &amp;c.

The <hi>Dove</hi> takes the meat which is thrown to it, and is ſatisfied; however, it feeds not it ſelf to the prejudice of any other Bird (as the Hawk doth.) A good Chriſtian hath learned in all eſtates to be content, and is ſatisfied with the portion God allots to him; he ſeeks no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the injury of another in his right; he covets not what is his neighbours; the World is a wide Sea, he fiſheth with his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, but he robs not his neighbours Net, nor ſuffereth his heart to covet what he hath in it.

                  <note place="margin">2 Motive.</note> Chriſt is the unqueſtionable <hi>Idea of all perfection,</hi> and there is nothing more worthy of a Chriſtian, then to labour after a conformity to Chriſt, to make Chriſt his <hi>Archetypon,</hi> In many ſciences, in order to a mans perfection imitation is as much his concernment, as his following the rules, and Precepts of Art. I am ſure it is ſo in the great <hi>Myſtery</hi> of <hi>Godlineſs:</hi> it is the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs which God is doing with us by his Providences, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 29. and which we ought to endeavour in our practice, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 10. <hi>to be made conformable unto the Image of the Son of God He hath given us an example, John</hi> 13. 15. and he hath left us an example, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 21. now what were Chriſts Eyes? <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 12. <hi>His Eyes are as the Eyes of Doves.</hi> It were an eaſy matter here to run through all the aforementioned particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.

Nay <hi>when he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled</hi> (ſaith <hi>Peter)</hi> he <hi>reviled not again,</hi> but ſuffered quietly, &amp;c. He had <hi>ſatisfied Eyes.</hi> What <hi>Covetouſneſs</hi> was he ever guilty of? he had a bag indeed, but it was for the poor, he had not an hole where to <hi>hide his head.</hi> Yet he neither coveted the holes of the Fox, nor the Neſts of the Birds.

He had <hi>meek and lowly Eyes,</hi> he ſays of himſelf, <hi>Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly.</hi> He had <hi>ſimple Eyes,</hi> no guile was found in his mouth, no deceit in his heart, no doubleneſs in his actions, &amp;c.

The Doves Eye is a certain</hi> note of a diſciple of Chriſt; many have the countenance of Doves, and the voice of Doves but they have not the Eye of Doves; an Hypocrite may <hi>groan</hi> like a Dove, and may look like a Dove in ſome part of his converſation, but yet want the Eye of a Dove.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">4 Motive.</note> My laſt argument, ſhall be from the honour &amp; repute which by them you will gain to your Maſter &amp; <hi>to his Goſpel in the World.</hi> It is one of the great things, that a Chriſtian hath to take care of, that the name of God for his ſake be not Blaſphemed in the World, and on the contrary, it ſhould be his great care ſo to order his converſation, as that by the ordering of it he may in the World gain a name, and glory to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and to his Goſpel, and bring up a good report of the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and the Inhabitants thereof. Now could we find a Chriſtian, that were harmleſs and innocent, doing injury to none, ſlow to conceive wrath, ready to forgive, free from greedineſs of the World, and covetouſneſs after that to which he hath no right, kind, and courteous, meek, and lowly, ſimple in heart, and of a ſingle Eye, tender ſpirited, of a clean converſation. chaſt, and ſober, of a broken Spirit, obſerving his waies, and circumſpect in his walking, how lovely would this Chriſtian, appear even in an evil World? How likely were a company of ſuch Chriſtians to recover the honour which others have loſt to Religion in the World? Oh! let the honour of the Goſpel
<pb n="849" facs="tcp:61084:429"/>
move you, that the report of your faith may ſpread, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may ſee that Religion is not an empty thing; and glorify God in the day of their viſitation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But you will ſay, are theſe things in our power? Can we create to our ſelves Doves Eyes? If not, why do you perſuade us? And why do you not rather ſpend your time in praying to God for us?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> I anſwer, that for the <hi>habits of theſe graces</hi> (the exerciſe of which I call to you for) they are the gift of God. The Creator gives the Dove its Eye, and the God of grace muſt create in men <hi>Doves Eyes.</hi> But yet,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>As to the outward exerciſe of theſe things</hi> (ſome of them at leaſt) <hi>much lyes in a mans power, in the uſe of that Common grace, which the Lord denies to none, till by their abuſe of it they have provoked him to deal ſo with them;</hi> they may doubtleſs, reſtrain their hands, and tongues from acts of cruelty, revenge, and malice, their bodies from unchaſt acts, &amp;c. it is true theſe acts as done by them cannot pleaſe God, becauſe not done from a right Principle, to a right manner, nor to a right End nor are they able to mortify their inward luſts, but the outward acts are their duty, and would take off much of the reproach caſt upon Religion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For thoſe who have received <hi>the habits of regenerating grace,</hi> 'tis true the Lord muſt excite them to action.

               <p>Prop. 1. <hi>Chriſt's Beauty doth infinitely tranſcend the Beauty of his Saints.</hi> The Saints are Stars, and there is not the leaſt Star, but hath its luſtre and glory; but yet there is a difference of Stars in glory, and the glory of the <hi>Sun of Righteouſneſs,</hi> of the <hi>Star</hi> that came out of <hi>Jacob,</hi> is far more eminent than the Beauty of other Stars, which are ſet in inferiour Orbs. <hi>Pulchritudo eſt qualitas per quam aliquid</hi>

                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, or <hi>quod pollet charitate.</hi> There is a corporeal Beauty, and there is a mental Beauty; the corporeal Beauty is nothing elſe beſides a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain lovelineſs that ariſeth from a due proportion of bodily parts, and due temperament of humours, and a comely bodily figure. The mental Beauty is a lovelineſs which ariſeth from a well tempered Soul, adorned with good natural diſpoſitions, moral habits, or ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb n="852" facs="tcp:61084:431"/>
infuſed habits of Graces. When I ſpeak of the Saints Beauty, and of Chriſt's Beauty, I underſtand it of a <hi>ſpiritual lovelineſs</hi> in them ariſing from that Grace which dwelled in Chriſt eſſentially, as God, and was poured out upon-him without meaſure, as Mediator, and is derived from him to all that truly believe in him. Now I ſay, this Beauty in Chriſt doth infinitely tranſcend that of the Saints. I will ſhew it you in ſome few particulars, which you may gather from what I ſaid before concerning the Saints Beauty. I ſhewed you that the Saints Beauty was not <hi>native,</hi> and <hi>primitive,</hi> but <hi>derivative,</hi> not <hi>eſſential,</hi> but <hi>accidental,</hi> not <hi>perfect,</hi> but <hi>imperfect.</hi> I told you that it was indeed <hi>durable,</hi> but yet the degrees of it might <hi>fade.</hi> Let me now open to you the tranſcendent Excellencies of Chriſt's Beauty.</p>
               <p n="1">1. And more generally: It is a glorious, <hi>incomprehenſible,</hi> and moſt <hi>incomparable Beauty; When the Word was made fleſh, and came and dwelt amongſt the Sons of men, they beheld his glory as the glory of the only begotten of the Father, full of Grace and Truth,</hi> Joh. 1. 14. In all created Beauties, there is not equality: There are ſome faces more beautiful, and ſome minds more beautiful and lovely than others, which yet have their lovelineſs too. (Beauty is a quality which is capable of degrees.) There is a glory in Chriſt's Beauty, which is not to be found in the Beauty of any Saint. The Apoſtle tells us, that the <hi>fulneſs of the Godhead dwelt in him bodily.</hi> And the Evangeliſt, that his glory <hi>was like the glory of the only begotten Son</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Col. 2. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>of God; he was full of Grace and Truth.</hi> Now, if you ask me what this glory is, what Tongue is able to expreſs it? Every one ſees a <hi>glory</hi> in the Sun's Light excelling the glory of the Stars; but where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Excellency is more than in the fulneſs of the Light, none is able to determine. Here it is true which the Vulgar Latine makes the ſenſe of <hi>Prov.</hi> 25. 27. <hi>Qui ſcrutatur Majeſtatem opprimetur à gloria:</hi> While the Soul ſets it ſelf to fathom the tranſcendent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Excellencies that are in Chriſt, it is overcome with glory, as the Eye is with the Light of the Sun, that looks too wiſtly upon it; as the Boy that appeared to the Auncient, (who had promiſed his People to open to them the Doctrine of the Trinity,) unlading water out of the Sea into a little hole with a Spoon, and told him that he ſhould ſooner have done that work, than he would have opened the Doctrine of the Trinity: So I may ſay in this caſe: Chriſt is every way wonderful. The Prophet (concerning his Birth) cries out, <hi>Who ſhall declare his Generation?</hi> I may here cry out, <hi>Who</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſa. 53. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>ſhall declare his glory?</hi> Thus much we can ſay, that his Beauty is
<pb n="853" facs="tcp:61084:431"/>
                  <hi>extenſively</hi> and <hi>intenſively</hi> more than that of the moſt eminent Saint in the World, that it is incomparable, and incomprehenſible, but it is impoſſible fully to delineate his glory to you; yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing we may ſpeak more particularly.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Therefore Chriſts Beauty is a <hi>Primitive Beauty.</hi> The Beauty of the moſt eminent Saint is no more than a derivative Beauty; we are <hi>clean through Chriſt's cleanneſs,</hi> and we are <hi>comely through Chriſt's comelineſs.</hi> Take the Saint out of Chriſt he hath nothing in him but blackneſs, uglineſs, and deformity, all his Beauty is derived from Chriſt; he is but like the Star, that hath its Light from the Sun, being of it ſelf but a thicker part of coeleſtial matter; yea he is in a lower degree than a Star, which the Philoſopher ſaith hath ſome (though a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſmall) Light of his own. The Child of God of himſelf is not only dark, but darkneſs: <hi>You were once darkneſs</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle)<note place="margin">Eph. 5. 8. John 1. 9. 8. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>but now you are light in the Lord.</hi> But now Chriſt is not only <hi>light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom,</hi> but <hi>light it ſelf: I am the true Light, Job.</hi> 1. 9. <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 12. Yea, and his Light, his Beauty is from himſelf. Conſider him as God equal with the Father, and coaevous with him; all the Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections were in him. The whole Beauty of the Godhead was in Chriſt. Conſider him indeed as to his Humane Nature, ſo his Beauty was derivative; the Spirit was <hi>given to him</hi> (though <hi>not by mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure)</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 3. 34. Col. 1. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 34 <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 19.) <hi>It pleaſed the Father that in him ſhould all fulneſs dwell.</hi> But conſider now the Lord Jeſus Chriſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally, as <hi>God and Man,</hi> and ſo all his Beauty was <hi>Primitive,</hi> and from himſelf: His Divine Nature being the Fountain of all Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and his Humane Nature receiving the fulneſs of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head from that Nature to which it was joyned, in the fellowſhip of the ſame Perſon: Now look what difference there is betwixt the Original Light of the Sun, and the borrowed Light of a Star, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Primitive Light of the Fire, and the Derivative Light of a Taper, ſuch a tranſcendent difference there is between the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Chriſt, and the Beauty of a Chriſtian.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Chriſt's Beauty is an <hi>Eſſential Beauty.</hi> When I diſcourſed to you concerning the Beauty of Chriſtians, I told you that their Beauty was <hi>accidental</hi> and <hi>adventitious;</hi> all thoſe gracious diſpoſitions which are found in the Souls of Saints, which make them lovely and beautiful, either in the Eyes of Chriſt, or of their Brethren, are but adventitious qualities, and accidents, no part of their Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; But Chriſt's Beauty is <hi>Eſſential</hi> to him. It is certainly true, that there are no accidents in God; all that love, and goodneſs, and
<pb n="854" facs="tcp:61084:432"/>
mercy, which is in Jeſus Chriſt, that ſlowneſs to conceive a wrath, and readineſs to forgive, it is all Eſſential unto him.—<hi>Eſſentia Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vina identificat ſibi omnia quae ſunt in Divinis</hi> (ſay the Schoolmen) Chriſt is from his Eſſence wiſe, good, gracious, holy, &amp;c. Now every ones Reaſon will eaſily apprehend a tranſcendent difference between Eſſential and Subſtantial Beauty, and Adventitious and Accidental Beauty. But</p>
               <p n="4">4. Chriſt's <hi>Beauty</hi> is a <hi>ſpotleſs Beauty;</hi> He is called the <hi>Sun of Righteouſneſs.</hi> The Sun hath no ſpots in it, it is all beautiful, all glorious. The Saints Beauty is a <hi>ſpotted Beauty,</hi> or at leaſt a Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty attended with ſpots; it is like the Beauty of the Moon; the Moon is a glorious creature, but the Moon hath its ſpots. Take the faireſt Saint in the World, he hath ſome blemiſhes, much grace, but ſome corruption, much rectitude, but ſome crookedneſs; yea, he is in nothing perfect. He <hi>believeth,</hi> but crieth out, <hi>Lord help my unbelief.</hi> He loveth God, this is his Beauty: Oh! but he wants ſome degrees of love, he bewails his want of love to God, and begs of God to teach him to love him; there's his ſpot in his Beauty. He doth direct his waies towards God; there's his Beauty: But he<note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 5.</note> cries out, <hi>Oh that my waies were directed to keep thy Statutes!</hi> there's his ſpot, there's his deformity. But now look upon Chriſt, there was no ſpot found in him, no defect of Beauty, no mixture of deformity; no guile was found in his mouth, no deceit in his heart, no crookedneſs in his actions.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Chriſt's Beauty</hi> is a <hi>never fading Beauty.</hi> I remember that I told you concerning the Beauty of the Saints, that it is a durable Beauty, it is never wholly loſt, and it is true in the Eyes of Chriſt, but what's the reaſon? becauſe the Providence of God continually upholds that ſtate of Beauty which is once conferred: Nor hath God ſo ordered the upholding of the Saints Beauty, but that it may fade and decay as to degrees, yea and be wholly loſt (as to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Judgment.) 'Tis true, the <hi>Beauty</hi> of Juſtification can never be loſt, can never decay, but the Beauty of Holineſs may. Now, Holineſs is a great part of the Saints Beauty, both in the Eyes of God, and alſo of men: But Chriſt's Beauty can never fade, the <hi>Roſe of Sharon</hi> cannot wither; this is proved from the third thing. If Beauty could fail from Chriſt, the Divine Eſſence might be extinguiſhed.</p>
               <p n="6">6. In the laſt place; Chriſts beauty is a <hi>communicative Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> The lovelieſt face in the World, cannot procreate ſuch ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="855" facs="tcp:61084:432"/>
the moſt vertuous ingenuous mind, cannot communicate its vertue, and ingenuity ſo as to poſſeſs another Soul with it You have many a Child of God, that is exceeding beautiful, both by <hi>juſtifying,</hi> and <hi>regenerating grace,</hi> but what they have is to themſelves. The wiseſt Virgins can lend no Oil to the fooliſh; if they do, there will not be enough for them both. But now Chriſts Beauty is communicative, he is in himſelf comely, and he can put his comelineſs upon others, yea (which is more) he can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, without loſs to himſelf, as the Fire gives heat to all in the Room, and yet hath no leſs heat in itſelf, or as the Sun inlightneth the Moon, and all the Stars, yea and all the World, and yet hath as much light ſtill as it had before that commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication. So doth the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, he hath communicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Beauty to <hi>ten thouſand thouſand Saints</hi> even to all that have lived ſince <hi>Adams</hi> fall to this day. They were all comely <hi>through his comelineſs put upon them,</hi> yet hath he in himſelf the ſame Beauty he ever had. But I have ſpoke enough to the opening of this point. I come to the application in three or four words.</p>
               <p n="1">

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Profeſſors have been too apt to think of themſelves above others,</hi> forgetting that of the Apoſtle in that Chap. v. 10. <hi>In honour preferring one before another;</hi> ah how vile have Brethren ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in one anothers Eyes? How ready have the followers of <hi>Paul</hi> been to deſpiſe the followers of <hi>Cephas,</hi> and thoſe that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed <hi>Apollo</hi> to deſpiſe thoſe that followed <hi>Paul?</hi> How ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject have we been to contemn thoſe not of our own form, though poſſibly better Scholars in Chriſts School then we! (for Scholarſhip in Religion is not to be judged by forms in the Church?) Certainly it had been much better for thoſe ſelf conceited Chriſtians, that looking upon their own beauty have ſo ſcorned others, as low, legal Chriſtians, to have thought with themſelves. Ah! but what is my Beauty to Chriſts Beauty? And why do I deſpiſe, who my ſelf have not attained.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A 2d <hi>ſort of profeſſors have erred by thinking of themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove</hi>
                  <pb n="856" facs="tcp:61084:433"/>
                  <hi>the meaſure of faith given to them.</hi> I know nothing hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed ſo much, to the miſerable diſtempers of our Church as this, that our profeſſors have looked their faces in a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying glaſs, there they have beheld their parts above what indeed they were, yea and their graces too. But alas (Friends) Suppoſe them what you would have them, there is no cauſe of glorying, for <hi>if thou haſt received it, why doeſt thou glory, as if thou hadſt not received.</hi> And let the parts and graces that make thee beautiful be what they will, certainly they are ſhort of Chriſts ſtill (who is thy great Example.)</p>
               <p n="3">3. But <hi>moſt abominable are thoſe, who dream that they are as holy as Chriſt, as perfect as he is,</hi> yea that they are <hi>Chriſted</hi> and <hi>Godded.</hi> They may be <hi>Devilled,</hi> and <hi>Sathanized,</hi> with pride and ſelf conceit, but certainly, when the Saint is grown to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt pitch, Chriſt muſt be higher by the head, and ſhoulders. Did theſe <hi>poor worms,</hi> ever drink of that cup of which he drank? Or were they ever baptized with the Baptiſm where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he was baptized? If not, how come they to ſit at his right hand? were they the onely begotten Sons of God, <hi>full of grace and truth?</hi> How then come they (if they were not ſo) to be ſharers with him in his glory? Away then with this blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous pride; and if thou (O thou worm of the Earth!) knoweſt not how to difference Chriſts Beauty from thine, go to the Sun, and Moon, and Stars, and conſider if the imperfect twink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling light of the latter bear any Proportion to the triumphing light of the former; go and learn, how the heat of thy hand (made hot by the Fire) can poſſibly be proportionable to the heat of the Fire, which gave thy hand what heat it hath. But no more of this. It is a thing not fit to be named amongſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. This is the firſt Uſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Uſe 2.</note> In the 2d place; Let this Caution you againſt that which the Apoſtle <hi>Jude</hi> complains of, <hi>Jude</hi> 16. <hi>Having mens per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in admiration.</hi> Under the former branch of Application I took notice of one great cauſe, of the ſad miſcarriages of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors in our age; I ſhall here touch upon another, It is <hi>This having mens perſons in admiration,</hi> Chriſtians have had ſuch a one in their Eye, whom they have looked upon as an holy and eminent perſon, full of Spiritual Beauty, and him they have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed over hedge and ditch, never looking at Chriſt all the way. It is good to behold the workings of Grace upon thoſe
<pb n="857" facs="tcp:61084:433"/>
who are made the ſubjects of it; but to what end? What? that we might admire them, and follow them? no, but that we might admire God in them, and that Grace of Chriſt by which they are ſo holy, ſo humble, ſo meek, ſo eminent in any Grace. I am afraid many have made another uſe of Profeſſors ſeeming Beauty in theſe times, and the Lord hath let them ſee, that their <hi>Beauty was vain,</hi> and their appearing <hi>Favour deceitful.</hi> Certainly Brethren, if that which you have heard be true, Chriſt alone is to be admired by you; he is the chiefeſt of ten thouſand. Do you hear any one ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſuch a Miniſter, ſuch a Chriſtian is fair, O! he, or ſhe is fair, they have Doves Eyes, look thou up to Heaven, and ſay, Nay, (my dear Saviour!) <hi>thou art fair;</hi> theſe are derivative Beauties, thine is a primitive Beauty; the Beauty of theſe is but an accidental, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventitious Beauty, thine is an eſſential, ſubſtantial Beauty; theſe are mixed Beauties, thine is a perfect Beauty. We have hearts that are exceeding carnal. Men are very prone to admire their fellows ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for <hi>Outward Advantages, than for Spiritual Perfections;</hi> more for outward parts, than for Grace; and when they take notice of Grace in any, to admire them rather than Chriſt for the Grace of God beſtowed upon them. The Woman, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. 27. was guilty of the firſt, that hearing Chriſt ſpeak, lift up her voice and ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed is the Womb that bare thee, and the Paps which thou haſt ſucked.</hi> Chriſt reforms her wiſh, <hi>v.</hi> 28. yea rather, <hi>Bleſſed are they that hear the Word of God and keep it.</hi> The <hi>Corinthians</hi> were guilty of the ſecond, who much admired thoſe amongſt them that had <hi>parts, and extraordinary gifts:</hi> The Apoſtle endeavours to reform that, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 31.—<hi>I ſhew unto you a more excellent way;</hi> that was Grace. Grace is better than all the gifts in the World. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are alſo ſubject to a third Errour, where they ſee, or at leaſt think they ſee eminent Grace in any, they are prone to admire them, and follow them. But Chriſtians! I ſhew unto you a more excellent object; do you ſee eminent grace in any, admire Chriſt in them, and the eminency of Grace in Chriſt, who hath given them ſuch a proportion. But let Chriſt ſtill be greater in the Throne than the greateſt Saint upon the Earth; admire him, and follow him. But that will be a third branch of Application.</p>

                  <hi>What you have heard, methinks, ſhould ſend you all away filled with the</hi> admiration of Chriſt, panting with deſires after Chriſt, and filled with the love of him.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I ſay firſt, <hi>Filled with the admiration of Chriſt.</hi> Have you at
<pb facs="tcp:61084:434"/>
any time ſeen an eminent Chriſtian abounding with love to God, zeal for him, clothed with humility, buried in ſelf-denial, adorned with any Graces which have made him acceptable to all with whom he hath converſed, and have you admired ſuch a one, how he could abridge himſelf of the ſweets and contentments of this life, and ſatisfie himſelf with being any thing, or nothing, ſo he might but attain to the Reſurrection of the Dead, win Chriſt, be found in him, and win others to him? and will you not admire that Fountain from whence all theſe ſtreams are derived? Is he a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable creature that gazeth upon a twinkling Star, and admires the luſtre of it, and looks upon the Sun without any admiration at all. Oh! admire Chriſt, to whom all created Perfections are no more than ſo many drops of Water to the Ocean, ſo many grains of Sand to a Mountain, ſo many ſlender Beams to the body of Light in the Sun.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Shall not this ſend you away panting after <hi>Union, and the ſeal of Union with Chriſt?</hi> Man as a ſenſual creature, deſires corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Beauty, and 'tis hard for him to ſee it in a Woman free for him, and not to deſire her for it. Man as a rational creature deſires <hi>mental Beauty,</hi> and it is hard for him to know of any adorned with moral Vertues, and with a pleaſing and ingenuous diſpoſition, and not to deſire friendſhip and acquaintance with him or her that is ſo qualified. Man as regenerate and a ſpiritual new creature, deſires ſpiritual Beauty; and 'tis ordinary for Chriſtians, ſeeing others more eminent in Grace than themſelves, to deſire fellowſhip with them, and to be made partakers of their Grace. But lo here Chriſtians, a beautiful Object excelling all created Beauties; Lo here one that is the faireſt amongſt the Sons of Men; Lo here one to whom all the <hi>Lillies of the Field,</hi> yea even <hi>Solomon</hi> himſelf in all his glory, was never like; ſhall not your hearts pant after Union with him? Shall none ſay, Oh that this Chriſt were mine, his Grace mine, his Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty mine, his Glory mine! Shall not every Soul which hath had a glimpſe of his Glory, deſire <hi>that he would kiſs it with the kiſſes of his mouth,</hi> that it might have further confirmations of its Intereſt in him?</p>
               <p n="3">3. And thirdly; Shall not all your hearts, who have this day heard of his Beauty, burn with further <hi>love to him?</hi> Doth the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans heart leap when ſhe hears her Husband magnified? Doth ſhe pride her ſelf in ſecret thoughts, ſaying, <hi>This is my Beloved, This is my Husband?</hi> and doth the commendation which others give him
<pb n="859" facs="tcp:61084:434"/>
blow the Coals of Love in her heart, and make them burn unto a flame? Oh that this Diſcourſe might have ſuch an influence upon you this day! Have not your hearts burned within you, while I have diſcourſed in your Ears concerning Chriſt's lovelineſs? O go home now and love him more! But our Saviour hath ſaid. <hi>If you love me, keep my Commandments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Laſtly; Therefore ſeeing that the <hi>Beauty of Chriſt is ſo tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent a Beauty,</hi> let all the Children of God do that one thing, (which St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith he did) <hi>viz. Not think that he hath attained,</hi> but <hi>forgetting that which is behind, preſs on forward to that which is before, unto the price of the High Calling.</hi> Chriſt is our mark; we are to learn of him to be lowly, and meek, to be holy and ſeparate from ſin. Let no man therefore ſet up himſelf a ſtand ſhort of this mark, and let every one ſee, that there is room for him yet to be more and more holy; thou mayeſt be as holy as thy Neighbour, but thou art not yet as holy as Chriſt; that's that thou ſhouldeſt ſtudy; that's it which thou ſhouldſt labour after. But this is enough to have ſpoken to the firſt Obſervation. The ſecond follow: That the ſenſe of that <hi>Value</hi> and <hi>Eſtimate</hi> which <hi>Jeſus Chriſt puts upon our Souls, ſhould make us put an high value upon him.</hi> The Spouſe's ſaying, <hi>Thou art fair</hi> (my Love!) <hi>Thou art fair,</hi> made her reply <hi>Thou art fair my Beloved.</hi>

                  </gap> It is a word often made uſe of in Scripture, ſignifying (ſometimes) that which gives ſatisfaction to the outward Senſes; ſometimes that which gives
<pb n="860" facs="tcp:61084:435"/>
ſatisfaction to the mind. You read of the <hi>pleaſant harp, Pſal.</hi> 81. 3. of <hi>pleaſant riehes, Prov.</hi> 24. 3. of the <hi>ſweet Pſalmiſt,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 1. in all which Texts, this word is uſed: it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times denotes the <hi>Satisfaction of the</hi> mind in an object, thus it is ſaid to be a <hi>pleaſant thing</hi> to praiſe God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 135. 3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147. 1. and a <hi>pleaſant thing</hi> to <hi>keep Gods Commandments, Prov.</hi> 22. 18. and to ſee brethren dwelling together in unity; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 133. 1. in all which Texts alſo this Word is uſed. The Spouſe here uſeth the word by way of <hi>auxeſis</hi> adding ſomething to what ſhe had ſaid before; Thou art <hi>fair:</hi> Yea <hi>pleaſant.</hi> The Propoſition is plainly this:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt is not only beautiful, but pleaſant.</p>
               <p>I ſhall ſpeak to this Propoſition by way of <hi>Explication,</hi> and <hi>Application.</hi> By way of <hi>Explication,</hi> I ſhall enquire, <hi>what is meant by pleaſant?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> How the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is not only fair, but alſo pleaſant? <hi>I ſhall there ſubjoin the confirmation.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>1.</hi> Qu. What doth the Spouſe mean, when ſhe ſays Chriſt is pleaſant?</p>
               <p>The word tranſlated pleaſant, is ſometimes uſed to ſignify what is grateful to the ſenſual Eye, and ſo may be conceived <hi>Synonymous,</hi> to the term <hi>fair,</hi> but I conceive the Spouſe here intendeth ſomething more, (as I hinted to you before.) A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men, beauty properly relates to the complexion, <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs</hi> to the <hi>converſation,</hi> a man may be fair and yet not <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant,</hi> he may have a fair face, and a falſe heart, a ſweet coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and a ſour Soul. But yet this difference will not ſerve us here. For Chriſts beauty is not a corporeal, ſenſual beauty, but an inward Spiritual beauty, and it is yet harder to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, <hi>fair,</hi> and <hi>pleaſant,</hi> as they relate to Chriſt: <hi>Bernard</hi>

               <p n="3">3. I ſhall offer you a third Notion of the term. As amongſt men, we may eaſily diſtinguiſh betwixt <hi>beauty,</hi> and <hi>pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> whether you take beauty, for the comelineſs of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, or the Ornament of the inward man. A man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man may have a ſweet complexion, a lovely Countenance, a beautiful perſonage, and yet have a debauched Soul, and ſo be far from pleaſantneſs, yea a man may have a <hi>mental beauty,</hi> and yet not pleaſant, no good Companion for ones life. There are many men who are wiſe, and juſt, and learned, and yet poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly, through pride, moroſity, or ſurlineſs, or reſervedneſs, not pleaſant: Pleaſantneſs doth much refer to the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation: and if we allow this ſenſe of the <hi>term;</hi> by which (As our own Annotators obſerve) the Spouſe doth elegantly correct, and raiſe the ſenſe of what ſhe had before ſaid: Then this is that which the Spouſe ſaith: <hi>My Dear Saviour, is not only beautiful in the Eye of my mind,</hi> both <hi>in reſpect of his Maj ſty, and glory, and of that Grace, which was poured forth upon his lips, in reſpect of the eminent perfections, both of his Divine, and humane Nature,</hi> but <hi>he is alſo lovely, and amiable, and ſo I have ſound him in all his diſpenſations to me and alſo in all my converſe with him.</hi> Thus it denoteth the pleaſantneſs of the Souls Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Chriſt, and may comprehend both his Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of himſelf to the Souls of his People <hi>in and through his Ordinances,</hi> and alſo, his Communication of himſelf to them,
<pb n="862" facs="tcp:61084:436"/>
by way of more immediate, Spiritual influences; and it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth thus much, <hi>That a Chriſtians walking with God, is a pleaſant walking,</hi> you know that the life of a Child of God in Scripture is expreſſed under ſeveral Notions; it is ſometimes called, <hi>a walking with God.</hi> It is ſaid of <hi>Enoch, he walked with God, Gen.</hi> 5. 22. 24. the like of <hi>Noah, Gen.</hi> 6. 9. it is called, a walking <hi>in Gods ways:</hi> And <hi>after Gods Commandments.</hi> A <hi>walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Chriſt,</hi> Col. 2. 6. A <hi>walking in the Spirit, Gal.</hi> 5. 16. 25. Chriſt is he who maintaineth, and influenceth, and upholdeth, a Chriſtians life, he is the Companion of his life, now that which the Spouſe aſſerts is, that Chriſt is not a ſour Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to make uſe of the ſimilitude of the Text. Many a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man hath an Husband, who it may be is a comely Perſon learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſober, wiſe, but yet poſſibly of a moroſe reſerved temper, or of a proud, and ſurly diſpoſition, he is fair but he is not pleaſant, Jeſus Chriſt the Husband to a gracious heart, is not only beautiful, ſo as a Soul may pleaſe it ſelf in beholding of him, and looking upon him, but he is alſo pleaſant: all his deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and converſe with the Souls of his People are ſweet, and delightful. And thus much may ſerve to have ſpoken to the firſt queſtion, and for the more general explication of the term; the ſecond follows, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2.</hi> Qu. How is the Lord Jeſus Chriſt pleaſant? And in what particulars doth his pleaſantneſs appear?</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Pleaſantneſs implies a general ſweetneſs, and lovelineſs in converſation,</hi> 2 Sam. 1. 26.

David</hi> apprehended a lovelineſs in his converſe with <hi>Jonathan:</hi> as a man delights to be in the Company of his friend, and hath much Satisfaction in it, ſo it is with the gracious Soul.

               <p n="1">1. It is a pleaſant thing for the Soul of a Chriſtian, to enjoy Chriſt in his Ordinances, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84. 1, 2. <hi>How amiable are thy Tabernacles O Lord of Hoſts, my Soul longeth, yea even fainteth, for the Courts of the Lord:</hi> it is a pleaſant thing to a Chriſtian,
<pb n="863" facs="tcp:61084:436"/>
to hear of Chriſt in a Sermon, to look up to Chriſt in Prayer: to praiſe the name of God. <hi>David</hi> upon this argument engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Children of God to praiſe him, for it is <hi>pleaſant, Pſal.</hi> 135. 3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147. 1.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is a <hi>pleaſant thing,</hi> to a gracious Soul, <hi>from the influences of the Spirit of grace to direct his life according to the rule of Gods Word.</hi> As it was the meat and drink of our Saviour, to do the will of his Heavenly Father: ſo it is the meat of a diſciple, of Chriſt to do the will of Chriſt eſpecially when he findeth his Soul advantaged to it from the influences of the Spirit of Chriſt, <hi>Rom,</hi> 7. 22. I <hi>delight in the Law of God, after the inward man.</hi> Obſerve two things, St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth not ſay I <hi>delight in the Love of God;</hi> who could do otherwiſe then ſo? But I <hi>delight in the Law of God:</hi> an holy heart delights in the Law of God: but ſecondly, Obſerve the reſtriction, <hi>as to the inward man.</hi> This may prevent an objection. Will ſome poor Soul ſay, I cannot ſay that I delight in ſtrictneſs, the Lord Pardon it to me, I even force my ſelf upon any cloſe walking: But dooſt thou not <hi>delight in the Law of God as to thy inward man?</hi> If thou doeſt, Chriſt is pleaſant to thee, he is not pleaſant to thy fleſh, but he is pleaſant to thy Spirit.</p>
               <p n="2">2. you will further underſtand how Chriſt is pleaſant to the Soul, and receive a further confirmation of it, if you but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, <hi>what is requiſite to make one pleaſant,</hi> as a pleaſant Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, or a pleaſant Companion, of ones life, &amp;c. I conceive there are three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Some real poſitive worth.</hi> A man or woman that hath no worth, is pleaſant to none, but ſuch as are fools, or ſots, Chriſt hath an infinite worth in him, nay you will obſerve, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though a man have much worth in him, yet he is pleaſant to none but ſuch, as may have an advantage from his worth: the moſt learned man in the World hath no pleaſantneſs in him, to the apprehenſion of a Clown, that is not in a capacity to partake of his worth: ſo that to make a man pleaſant, he muſt not only have a real worth in him, but a worth of ſuch a Nature, as he to whom he is pleaſant may be advantaged; ſuch is Chriſt, ſuch are the excellencies of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To make a Perſon pleaſant (beſides a real worth,) there is required ſome <hi>ſutableneſs</hi> of <hi>nature, and diſpoſition, to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which ſo judgeth of him:</hi> take now an eminently learned
<pb n="864" facs="tcp:61084:437"/>
man in any ſcience, though he hath a worth in him, and ſuch a worth, as might to a novice be advantageous, yet all this doth not make him <hi>pleaſant</hi> that which makes the Husband plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to the Wife, and the Superior pleaſant to the inferiour, is ſome congruity of diſpoſition. And ſuch a congruity there is betwixt Chriſt and a believing Soul. Chriſt notwithſtanding all that perfection of grace, and excellency which is in him, and notwithſtanding, the aptitude, and fitneſs of his grace to the wants of a Soul, yet is not <hi>pleaſant</hi> to a natural man: he is not beautiful to him, becauſe he wanteth Spiritual Eyes to diſcern, he is not <hi>pleaſant</hi> to him, becauſe he wants that congruity of diſpoſition which is neceſſary: Chriſt is holy, he is unholy. But now the believer is made <hi>partaker of the Divine Nature,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. He is a <hi>partaker of Chriſt, Heb.</hi> 3. 14. And indeed hence ariſeth, that particular pleaſantneſs, which the believing Soul doth above any other Soul diſcern in Chriſt; even from that congruity.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To make any one, not only fair, but <hi>pleaſant, there will be required of him a Freedom from thoſe things, which ſpoil all pleaſantneſs in converſe,</hi> and a <hi>preſence and exerciſe of thoſe diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which are in themſelves grateful</hi> to <hi>humane Nature.</hi> I will inſtance in two on three, and ſhew you how Chriſt is freed from the former and poſſeſſed of the latter.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The pleaſant man muſt not be <hi>reſerved,</hi> but <hi>Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</hi> A man that is of a reſerved cloſe temper, may be a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Perſon and have much real worth in him, but yet he is not pleaſant: it is the Communicative man, who is the pleaſant man. Chriſt (upon this account) is pleaſant, he is not reſerved from the Souls of his Saints, Look now as it is with a man, if he be one that hath real worth and abilities to do good to his friend, and of a free temper, that if his friend ſpeaks to him he preſently hears and anſwers, if he asks him a queſtion, he preſently reſolves, this man now is a pleaſant man. Chriſt is pleaſant, as he is furniſhed, with a ſufficiency of power, and ability, for the comforting, reſolving, advantaging his Peoples Souls any way, ſo he is not reſerved from them. How free, was he with his diſciples while he was upon the Earth, how ready if they doubted to reſolve them, if they asked any thing of him to anſwer them, if he ſaw them troubled to reſolve them, &amp;c. Chriſt hath removed the place of his reſidence,
<pb n="865" facs="tcp:61084:437"/>
but he hath not changed his diſpoſition. How free is Chriſt ſtill with the Souls of his People? How ordinarily doth he reſolve their doubts, ſpeak peace to their Souls, anſwer their Prayers? Doth any Soul object againſt this in the words of <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 22. 3. <hi>I cry in the day time, and thou heareſt not, and in the night time I am not ſilent?</hi> That Soul ſhould do well to inquire, whether ſome reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedneſs found in it towards Chriſt, hath not cauſed Chriſt's reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedneſs to it; whether he doth not reſtrain <hi>Faith.</hi> He ſhould do well alſo to enquire, whether he be not miſtaken. Chriſt oft-times gives Anſwers which we do not underſtand. Finally; Let him <hi>wait,</hi> and he will ſee that Chriſt reſerves himſelf only that he might hereafter be more pleaſant to the Soul. But this is enough to have ſpoken to this firſt particular.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He that is <hi>pleaſant,</hi> is not <hi>moroſe,</hi> but <hi>courteous;</hi> a man may be communicative enough, and yet not <hi>pleaſant;</hi> he that is of a churliſh, dogged temper, moroſe in all his behaviour, is never plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant: He that is of a gentle behaviour, is pleaſant. Oh how <hi>gentle</hi> is the Lord Jeſus Chriſt! How tenderly he deals with his Peoples Souls! <hi>A bruiſed Reed he will not break, a ſmoaking Flax he will not quench,</hi> Mat. 12. 20. It was propheſied of him of old, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40. <hi>v.</hi> 11. <hi>that he ſhould gather the Lambs with his arm, and carry them in his boſom, and gently lead thoſe that are with young.</hi> If he ſpeaks to a poor laden ſinner, mark how tenderly he ſpeaks, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 29. <hi>Come unto me you that are weary and heavy laden, and I will eaſe you.</hi> I appeal to the Souls of you that fear God, Hath not Chriſt dealt tenderly with you? Hath he pleaded againſt you with his great Power? Have you at any time found him churliſh to your Souls? Nay, who is there amongſt you but hath admired his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions in his Word, and the manner of his diſpenſations unto your Souls? and can (from experience) ſay, <hi>He is pleaſant.</hi> If any Soul from its own experience object againſt this Notion, I ſhall only adviſe it to conſider, <hi>whether it hath not put a falſe interpretation upon Chriſt's diſpenſations to it:</hi> Or ſecondly, To diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Chriſt's ordinary dealings with the Souls of the People, and his carriage to it, upon ſome eminent provocations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. A third thing <hi>which makes a man pleaſant, is humility.</hi> The proud perſon is grateful to none, no not to him who is as proud as himſelf, but he who is full of humility, of a condeſcending ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, &amp;c. is ordinarily pleaſant to his Companion. Upon this account alſo <hi>Chriſt is pleaſant;</hi> he condeſcendeth to us who are of <hi>low degree.</hi>
                  <pb n="866" facs="tcp:61084:438"/>
Nothing more indears a Perſon of Honour, and makes him plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to his Companion, than when there is diſcerned in him a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs to ſtoop and be ſerviceable to thoſe who are beneath him: Oh how pleaſant is Chriſt upon this ſcore to every honeſt heart! From the time that he <hi>Nothing'd</hi> himſelf, and humbled himſelf to a death upon the Croſs, unto this day, he hath been, and ſtill is thus <hi>pleaſant</hi> to every gracious Soul. Every diſpenſation of ſpecial grace makes him thus more and more pleaſant to his Peoples Souls. But I have ſpoken enough to the Doctrinal part. I come now to the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Uſe 1.</note> By way of inference in the firſt place, let me conclude from <hi>hence, That a Chriſtian's Life muſt needs be a pleaſant Life.

                  <hi>I ſate down under his ſhadow with great delight, and his fruit was ſweet to my taſt.</hi> It is one great diſcouragement that keeps off men from following the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: They have taken up a fancy, that <hi>Chriſt is an hard Maſter; reaping where he hath not ſown, and gathering where he hath not ſtrawed.</hi> They fancy the life of a Chriſtian a moping life, burthened with cares, troubled with ſorrows, &amp;c. and think all their friends good daies are gone when once they turn Puritan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s, and begin to follow after God. And in very deed, then, and not before, do they begin to live, and to underſtand what true contentment is. Oh! let not this prejudice take hold of any of your Souls; come but taſt land ſee how good the Lord is. Might but this prevail with any of you to embrace the offers of Chriſt, and to fall in with the waies of God, let my Soul go for yours, if when once you have truly experienced the Contentment of a Chriſtian's life you do not with <hi>David</hi> chuſe to be a Door-keeper in the Houſe of God, rather than to dwell in the Tents of wickedneſs, if you prefer not one day in the Lord's Courts before a thouſand elſewhere. Let not the deceitful pleaſures of the World ſeduce you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if the Earth affords any ſatisfaction, that Soul hath it that walks with God, and hath a fellowſhip with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. By way of Argument, let me but plead with you,</p>
               <p n="1">1. To obſerve <hi>the difference between ſenſual and intellectual plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures:</hi> And again, betwixt <hi>rational and ſpiritual pleaſures.</hi> Who is
<pb n="867" facs="tcp:61084:438"/>
there that obſerves not how much the ſatisfaction of the mind, in the poſſeſſion of Learning and Vertue, excels all that ſatisfaction which the Eye hath in ſeeing, or the Ear in hearing? Chriſt is pleaſant to the Soul, not to the outward, but to the inward man. The pleaſures of the mind are <hi>rational</hi> or <hi>ſpiritual.</hi> The proportion which know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge beareth to the underſtanding of man, and which moral Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue bears to his Reaſon, makes them pleaſant, and creates an intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual rational pleaſure. But alas! it muſt be imperfect; for as the Eye is not ſatisfied with ſeeing, nor the Ear with hearing, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it poſſible that the Soul ſhould be ſatisfied with knowledge, or moral accompliſhments, eſpecially when it is awakened to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Eternity. Hence the Learned man, that before took pleaſure in his knowledge, being awakened, cries out, I with my Learning may go to Hell, when one that knows much leſs may go to Heaven; where's the pleaſure? But now the Soul that is poſſeſſed of Chriſt, hath its heart perfectly at reſt, becauſe it ſees its eternal Intereſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for, and cannot diſcern it ſelf in danger of future miſery. Furthermore, the things in which it takes pleaſure, are above the rank of all ſublimary contentments, even ſuch things as <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, nor hath Ear heard, nor can it enter into the Heart of man to conceive.</hi> Beſides, <hi>Conſcience is quiet.</hi> Conſcience is that which ſpoils much of the Worlds pleaſure; for as a <hi>good Conſcience is a continual feaſt,</hi> ſo an <hi>evil Conſcience</hi> is (more or leſs) a continual torment. Now <hi>Chriſt</hi> is he alone that quieteth the Conſcience. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a poor Chriſtleſs Soul drinks Wine in Bowls, and boaſt in their outwardly happy condition, but by and by a finger of a mans hand appears; their Conſcience begins to ſtir, and to tell them they are damned undone ſinners; what becomes of their pleaſure? But now the Soul that is in Chriſt, his Conſcience ſpeaks peace to him, he hath peace without trouble. And to give you a demonſtration of this pleaſantneſs of a Chriſtian's life, as I remember Chriſt ſaid of the <hi>Lillies, they neither ſpin, nor ſow, yet</hi> Solomon <hi>in all his glory is not like one of them:</hi> So give me leave to ſay; Step unto the poor Cottages of Chriſtians, who have ſearce Bread to eat, no Silken Rayments to put on, no Muſick to make them merry, no Money to ſpend, no Orchards or Gardens to delight them; and yet there's many a Nobleman, many a Gentleman who have all theſe in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, &amp; yet in all their glory are not like one of theſe Lillies; theſe poor Souls have more true content and pleaſure in one day, than they have in all their life, nor would they change conditions with
<pb n="868" facs="tcp:61084:439"/>
them. So true is that of <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 15. 16, 17. <hi>Better is a little with the fear of the Lord, than great Treaſures, and trouble there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. Better is a dinner of Herbs where love is, than a ſtalled Oxe, and hatred therewith.</hi> I dare warrant you, that the Philoſopher could have dined more ſweetly at home with Bread and Water, than at the Tyrants Table of Dainties in view of a ſharp Sword hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over his head by a thred. There's many a poor Chriſtian in this like a true ſpiritual <hi>Diogenes,</hi> that ſatisfieth himſelf with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the Sun upon his Tub, better than an <hi>Alexander</hi> could do himſelf with a whole World ſubdued to his feet.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <note place="margin">Uſe 2.</note> 2. <hi>Obſerve from hence the difference between Chriſt and luſts, Chriſt and the World.</hi> The Soul of man cannot be alone, it is either eſpouſed to <hi>luſts,</hi> and to the <hi>World,</hi> or elſe to the <hi>Lord Jeſus.</hi> There's many a one whoſe Soul is united to it's <hi>luſts. Luſt</hi> is its beloved. Can this Soul ſay, <hi>Behold thou art fair my Beloved, yea pleaſant?</hi> Doubtleſs nothing leſs. Reaſon tells the Drunkard, that his Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs is a foul thing, and Reaſon tells the Unclean perſon, that his Soul is united to a filthy thing. Take him that is united to the World, to the Riches of it, or to the Honours of it, Reaſon tells him they have no beauty in them; nor are they more pleaſant than beautiful. Ah! what racks of Conſcience have prophane ſinners oft-times? The Wine tickles the throat as it paſſeth, but it maketh the ſtomach ſick: The luſts of the fleſh leave a Thorn in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, which abides, when the pleaſure of them is vaniſhed. The World pleaſeth the Eye, while the figure of it paſſeth before it, but it is no more than <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a great fancy, and <hi>vexation of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> ſpoils the pleaſure of it. But Chriſt is pleaſant; never any Soul that followed him, repented of it; yea thoſe that follow him weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, never repent of their repentings. Bring me that Soul which ever ſaid I would I had never known, or never walkt with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Uſe 3.</note> Let this therefore prevail with every Soul that hears me this day, <hi>to get acquaintance with Chriſt;</hi> And 2. <hi>With thoſe who have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in him, to labour to grow up in him.</hi> 1.

of pleaſantneſs, it would go a great way to perſuade men into it. Hearken to the Wiſe man ſpeaking of Wiſdom, (of Chriſt indeed, and his Grace under the notion of Wiſdom) <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>Her waies are waies of pleaſantneſs, and all her paths are peace.

We are the <hi>Branches,</hi> and<note place="margin">John 15. 2. 5. 6.</note> therefore purged that we may bring <hi>forth fruit,</hi> ib. 5. 16. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther therefore the gracious Soul be looked upon as the <hi>Spouſe of Chriſt, and Married to him, by faith,</hi> its fruit is holineſs, or whether it be looked upon as a <hi>branch in Chriſt,</hi> ſtill its <hi>fruit is holineſs;</hi> our works (conſidering us as men) are our fruit. Now look, as ſeveral Plants, according to their different natures bring forth different fruit, ſome bring forth pleaſant, ſome bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fruit, ſome wholſom, ſome again noxious fruit: ſo it is with men and women, who are the <hi>Plants of the World;</hi> by Nature they are all wild Plants, and are corrupt, and bring forth cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt fruit, called by the Apoſtle, the fruit of ſin unto death: But having a new Nature given them by God, they<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 22. Eph. 5. 9. Gal. 5. 22.</note> bring forth fruit unto life, the fruits of righteouſneſs, which are alſo called the <hi>fruits of the Spirit, Eph.</hi> 5. 9. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 22. the fruit of <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> to ſhew the <hi>ſpecies,</hi> or kind of them, fruit <hi>unto life,</hi> ſhewing the conſequent of them, the <hi>fruit of the Spirit,</hi> ſhewing the more external cauſe of them: Now as theſe fruits more or leſs abound in the Soul, the Soul is more or leſs fruitful. This is the particular Saints fruit.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Churches fruitfulneſs</hi> is its bringing forth <hi>many Sons unto God.</hi> Children are the <hi>fruit of the body,</hi> cauſed by genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Gods Children are the fruit of the Church, cauſed by <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation;</hi> Converſion is called a begetting, 2 Pet. 1. 3. We are ſaid to be <hi>begotten of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Job.</hi> 5. 1. God is our Father,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 3.</note> but the Church is our Mother: It is the Church which bears us, which travels, and brings forth Children unto God: And the Saints are called the Churches Children, Iſa. 54. 13. <hi>All thy</hi>

                  <hi>Children ſhall be taught of the Lord, and great ſhall be the peace of thy Children.</hi> The thriving of the Church lies in this when ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Souls are in it converted, and brought home unto God. This is the Souls fruitfulneſs and thriving, and this is alſo the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches fruitfulneſs, and thriving. This is that which my Doctrine ſpeaketh of and ſaith, that i t dependeth upon Chriſts <hi>conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cton</hi>
                  <pb n="872" facs="tcp:61084:441"/>
                  <hi>with the Soul and with the Church.</hi> Look as the fruitfulneſs of the Woman depends upon the conjunction of her Husband with her, as the fruitfulneſs of the plant depends upon its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with the Earth; as the thriving of the Body by its meat, dependeth upon the bleſſing of God. <hi>Man liveth not by bread only, but by every word that cometh out of the mouth of God:</hi> And as the thriving of the plant dependeth upon the influence of the Heavens, the ſhinings of the Sun, and the diſtillations of the Clouds; ſo, yea much more then ſo, doth the thriving of a <hi>Church and of a Soul,</hi> depend upon the influence of Chriſts grace. I will prove it firſt <hi>concerning the particular Soul.</hi> 2. Concerning the Church, 1. <hi>Concerning the particular Soul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. It is Chriſt that <hi>giveth the Soul a prolifick vertue.</hi> The fruitful Woman muſt have a prolifick vertue, ſo muſt the plant of the field, otherwiſe the Woman is barren, and the plant is barren. That power which is in any Soul, to <hi>bring forth the fruit of holineſs,</hi> that is its prolifick vertue, and this is from the Lord; this is that which the Apoſtle calleth <hi>to will</hi> in <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 13.</note> 2. 13. <hi>The will is the root of all humane actions,</hi> and the power in the Soul to do them lies in its ability to will them. This is from the Lord, yea and from the Lord in a way of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial providence too. The God of Nature hath put into the creature a proliſick vertue that (ſuppoſing the particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of Ordinary Providence) the woman brings forth the fruit of the Body, in a Natural courſe. And ſo concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the plants of the field, (ſuppoſing the concurrence of Ordinary Providence) the plant brings forth fruit in its kind. But it is not thus with men, and women, as to the fruit of grace and of holineſs. It was thus indeed with <hi>Adam; Adam</hi> in the day of his creation (as to the fruit of holineſs) was like the plant of the field, indued with a proli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick vertue, he had not only Natural faculties, underſtanding, will, &amp;c. but he had a power, and diſpoſition in theſe faculties, to that which was good, this was connatural to him in the day of his creation; but as it is with the woman, created at firſt with this prolifick vertue, yet by accident this or that particular wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, may want it, and ſo is <hi>barren:</hi> So it is with all the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Adam,</hi> though in him created in <hi>ſtatu integro,</hi> with
<pb n="873" facs="tcp:61084:441"/>
a <hi>poſſe velle,</hi> a power to will that which is well pleaſing in the ſight of God, yet by that ſad accident of the firſt mans tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion we are all become barren, and without any power <hi>to will</hi> that which is good. A will indeed is left to us, but an indiſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in that will unto that which is good; we are <hi>reprobate unto every good work.</hi> And that not only, by wicked works, as men are by them hardened in ſin, and accuſtomed to Evil (and cuſtom we ſay is a ſecond Nature,) but even by Nature we are ſo. Now it is from Chriſt, that the Soul hath its firſt power, and ability ſo much as to move to a good action, 2 Cor. 3. 5. <hi>We are not of our ſelves ſufficient to think one good thought,</hi> Eph. 2. 5. <hi>When we were dead in ſin, he hath quickened us together by Chriſt.</hi> Life is the Principle of all operation, we are by Nature <hi>dead,</hi> it is the Lord that quickeneth us. Look as the Child moves not till it be <hi>quickened,</hi> ſo neither doth the Soul move unto any thing that is good until grace at firſt quickeneth it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As Chriſt gives the prolifick vertue to the Soul, <hi>ſo it is he alſo that doth excite this vertue to act.</hi> God hath given unto the plant a <hi>prolifick vertue</hi> from whence it is that it brings forth fruit; God hath given Bread-Corn a Power, and faculty to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh the Body, and it is from hence that it nouriſheth, but withal God by a <hi>daily Providence</hi> doth both uphold the faculties of the plant, and of the bread, and excite them to their exerciſe, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe neither would the bread nouriſh, nor the plant bring forth its fruit in its ſeaſon. So it is with the Soul. Suppoſing the Soul poſſeſſed, of a power to will that which is good, (the will being renewed through grace) yet it is God that excites this power, Phil. 2. 13. <hi>He giveth to do.</hi> Not only to will, but alſo to do. And indeed this muſt be granted, or elſe grace ſhall have the leaſt ſhare in any good action that is done by us, for the Act is more Noble then a meer Power, It is Chriſt that gives a Power to will, and it is Chriſt that gives the Act of willing. diſpoſing and quickening the Soul to the exerciſe of the Power which himſelf hath beſtowed upon it. For let us conſider whence it ſhould come: The Lord in the change of the heart, doth not change the <hi>Nature of man,</hi> but man hath a liberty in his will, I mean a <hi>liberty oppoſed to coaction,</hi> his will is not compelled to that which is good; he hath indeed a power, but not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling him: now when the will of man is in that ſtate that he
<pb n="874" facs="tcp:61084:442"/>
can will that which is good, or that which is evil, tell me what is it which inclineth him to the one rather then the other, ſave only the influence of Divine grace.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Nay, Thirdly, <hi>It is Chriſt that muſt aſſiſt in every good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;</hi> not only excite to it, but <hi>aſſiſt in it, or it will never be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sected.</hi> Even in natural productions, beſides the prolifick ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, which the fruitful woman muſt have, and muſt be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to her conception of a Child in her womb; and beſides the influence of Providence, which muſt be ſuppoſed to excite this vertue, which firſt cauſeth the conception (as to the Divine cauſation) there muſt alſo be a daily influence, and concurſe of Providence, preſerving and upholding the womans natural fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, &amp;c. or ſhe miſcarrieth, and the fruit of her body thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not; and as it is with a Plant, notwithſtanding its proli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick vertue, and the influence of Providence exciting this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in the Spring time to put forth it ſelf, there muſt be a dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly influence of Providence upholding the natural vertues of the Plant, and aſſiſting them to the perfecting of the fruit; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this, though the Plant hath ſuch a vertue, and hath put it out, yet the fruit dwindleth away, and comes to nothing: So it is with a Soul: Suppoſing the Soul quickened, born again, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed unto that which is good; and ſuppoſing it to have begun a good action, yet without the continuance of the ſame grace with the Soul, and in the Soul, it brings nothing to perfection. Hence <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 2. Chriſt is faid to be <hi>the Author and Finiſher of our Faith.</hi> Hence ſaith St. <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 2. 20. <hi>I live, but yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me; and the life which I now live in the fleſh, I live by the Faith of the Son of God.</hi> And 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 10. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>He laboured, yet not he, but the grace of God which was with me.</hi> To be ſhort then; To a particular Soul's fruitfulneſs in good works, there is required, 1. <hi>The Grace of God upon the Soul,</hi> giving it a power to act. 2. <hi>The Grace of God in the Soul, exciting it to its ſpiritual operations.</hi> 3. <hi>The Grace of God with the Soul, aſſisting it in its operations.</hi> This not ſuppoſed, the Soul either wants a power <hi>to will,</hi> or wants a <hi>power to move, to do,</hi> &amp;c. The Reaſon of this lies not only in that general neceſſary influx upon the creature, which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to all its motions and actions, and which God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to himſelf, to grant or withhold as he pleaſeth. But in this, that through the Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> the Nature of Man is ſo
<pb n="875" facs="tcp:61084:442"/>
lapſed, that it requireth a more particular eminent influx of Providence upon it, to inable it unto that which is ſpiritually good, its <hi>ſpiritually prolifick vertue,</hi> being by the fall quite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct, and the Soul of every man and woman <hi>dead in creſpaſſes and ſins.</hi> But thus much ſhall ſerve for the firſt. I come to the ſecond, to prove it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Concerning the Church;</hi> That <hi>neither can it be fruitful with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conjuuction with Chriſt.</hi> I told you, that the fruitfulneſs of the Church lies in its bringing forth many Sons unto God. The more Souls are converted, the more fruitful the Church is; but without Chriſt's conjunction with it, it bringeth forth none. If Chriſt's <hi>preſence</hi> be in his Church, it brings forth many Souls. If he be not preſent, it <hi>brings forth no Children.</hi> This will eaſily appear by conſidering how the Church of God is Inſtrumental to the converſion of Souls; and by making it appear to you that theſe cauſes are not <hi>principally efficient ſole cauſes;</hi> nor can be ſo, but are only inſtrumental cauſes. 2. That <hi>upon experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence it is made evident,</hi> that where <hi>Chriſt doth not concur,</hi> they do nothing. For the firſt,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Church is to be conſidered as to <hi>its parts,</hi> and as <hi>to its priviledges;</hi> as to <hi>what God hath planted</hi> in it, and what <hi>God hath betruſted to it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to its parts; So it is made up of <hi>Officers,</hi> and <hi>members.</hi> As to its <hi>priviledges,</hi> ſo there is committed to it the <hi>Oracles of God;</hi> the <hi>Myſteries of God;</hi> the <hi>Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven:</hi> there is none of all theſe, but have or may have, (for ought I know) an <hi>inſtrumental cauſation,</hi> in bringing forth Children unto God, or in bringing of them up, but none of them have a <hi>Principal efficiency</hi> none of them have a <hi>ſole efficiency,</hi> nor can produce the effect without Chriſts conjunction; let us look upon them ſeverally.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Look firſt upon the Officers of the Church:</hi> theſe were <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Apoſtles Evangeliſts Prophets:</hi> Ordinary, <hi>Paſtors,</hi> and <hi>Teachers.</hi> That theſe have an inſtrumental cauſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the converſion of Souls is plain, they were ſet in the Church, <hi>for the perfecting of the Saints, Eph.</hi> 4. 12. for the perfecting their number, and for the perfecting of their graces, <hi>Paul</hi> calls them Fathers, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 15. and ſaith he <hi>begat</hi> the <hi>Corinthians.</hi> He ſaith the ſame of <hi>Oneſimus:</hi> but alas, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles of old, ſo Miniſters now, have no more then an <hi>inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality</hi>
                  <pb n="876" facs="tcp:61084:443"/>
in this production: <hi>Paul planted,</hi> and <hi>Apollos watered,</hi> but <hi>God gave the increaſe,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6. God was all, <hi>he that plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing,</hi> he that <hi>watered was nothing,</hi> but God that gave the increaſe was all, <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 9: They are but <hi>waterers together with God,</hi> workers <hi>together with him.</hi> Hence though <hi>Paul</hi> Preached the ſame Doctrine to all, yet he was to ſome, the <hi>ſavour of life unto life,</hi> to others, the <hi>ſavour of death unto death.</hi> And though his earneſt deſire was to convert his own Nation, it was his hearts <hi>deſire,</hi> and <hi>Prayer to God that they might be ſaved, Rom.</hi> 10. 1. yet he could not effect it. And if the Officers of the Church, who are under a ſpecial ordination of God for the great end of converſion, could do no more, it will eaſily be granted of private members, whoſe indeavours in quickening others, though they may be ſometimes bleſſed, of God to ſuch an end, yet doubtleſs are not more efficient to it then the labours of Miniſters, nor yet in an equal tendency with their's unto ſo great an end.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>As to the priviledges granted to the Church.</hi> The <hi>Oracles of God,</hi> are committed to the Church, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 2. <hi>it is the pillar and ground of truth,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. the <hi>myſteries</hi> of God are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 1. <hi>The keys of the Kingdom of Heaven are Committed to it. Mat.</hi> 16. 19. I underſtand ever by the firſt term, the <hi>Word of God,</hi> and the diſpenſation of it in the Preaching of the Goſpel: by the ſecond, the <hi>Sacraments of the Goſpel,</hi> by the third, the <hi>Cenſures of the Church.</hi> I know the terms are more generical, and not ſo to be reſtrained (I only for diſtinction ſake ſo reſtrain them at preſent) nor do I med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle here with the diſputes, whether the diſpenſation of theſe or any of theſe, belong to the whole Church, or only to Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, nor yet to which of the Officers: I ſhall only aſſert two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Scripture ſeemeth to aſſign to all theſe, ſome inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentality as to the bringing forth of Children unto God:</hi> this is plain. 1. Concerning the <hi>Word,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 15. I <hi>have begotten you through the Goſpel,</hi> James 1. 18. <hi>of his own will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat he us by the word of truth:</hi> As to the Sacraments, for the Sacrament of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> we are ſaid to be <hi>Baptized</hi> into Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 27. and again, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38. <hi>to be Baptized</hi> for the <hi>Remiſſion of ſins.</hi> For the Sacrament of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; though I dare not aſſert it a <hi>converting Ordinance</hi> yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably
<pb n="877" facs="tcp:61084:443"/>
it hath its inſtrumentality to the Salvation of Souls. For <hi>Cenſures</hi> they have alſo their <hi>inſtrumentality,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 5. the end of their adminiſtration is <hi>for the deſtruction of the fleſh, that the Spirit may be ſaved in the day of Chriſt.</hi> But now.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2. It is as plain,</hi> that they have but an inſtrumental cauſation, <hi>and ſeparated from</hi> the influences of Chriſt, and his concurrence with them; they do nothing, <hi>hence,</hi> James <hi>2. 18.</hi> of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, John <hi>1. 13. we are born again not of</hi> blood, <hi>nor</hi> of the will of the fleſh: <hi>nor</hi> of the will of man: <hi>but</hi> of the will of God, <hi>John 3. 5.</hi> except you be born again, <hi>of</hi> water and of the Spirit you cannot enter into the Kingdom of God. <hi>Thus the truth is evidenced from Scripture. And Scriptural rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. In the ſecond place? <hi>Conſider all experience, where-ever the Word of God hath been Preached, the Sacraments adminiſtred, Church Cenſures duly executed, ſo long as Chriſt hath granted his preſence with the adminiſtrations; they have been made mighty in order to the bringing home of Souls unto God.</hi> Where the Lord hath withdrawn his preſence, either as to the generality of Perſons under the external adminiſtrations or as to any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Souls they have ſignified nothing. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> doth but make the <hi>heart of the People fat, and their Ears heavy,</hi> and <hi>ſhuts their Eyes, Ch.</hi> 6. 10. he complains, that <hi>he laboureth in vain and ſpendeth his ſtrength for nothing and in vain. Saint</hi> Pauls <hi>Goſpel is to the Jews a ſtumbling block,</hi> and to the Gentiles fooliſhneſs, 3000 are converted at St. <hi>Peters</hi> Sermon, while Chriſt is in his Bed with his Church, but few or none, of the Jews in their Synagogues, <hi>Acts</hi> 19. they were <hi>hardened.</hi> Chriſt was gone out of his Bed, and it was now no longer <hi>green</hi> and flouriſhed no more. But this is enough to have ſpoken as to the proof of the Doctrine, come we now to the Application.</p>
               <p>The Propoſition might be applied variouſly.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the confutation of the errors of thoſe who either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the neceſſity, of any conjunction of Chriſt with the Soul, as to the production of the fruits of grace, or at leaſt of ſuch a conjunction, as is unqueſtionably neceſſary; and of thoſe who think, that there is a power in mans will, <hi>ad bonum Spirituale,</hi> to produce that which is Spiritually good, and that a <hi>moral ſuaſion</hi> is ſufficient to the converſion of a Soul.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We might from hence obſerve the reaſon, why the <hi>Word</hi>
                  <pb n="878" facs="tcp:61084:444"/>
                  <hi>and Ordinances of God</hi> are ſo ineffectual as to ſome, however effectual unto others, but I have not time to enlarge ſo far. I ſhall therefore cloſe up all with one Branch of Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,—</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Uſe</note> Beſeeching every Soul that heareth me this day to labour, that <hi>Chriſt may yet be kept in his Bed, in our Bed.</hi> The Bed is the reſting place, while Chriſt remaineth and reſteth amongſt his People, <hi>The Bed is green.</hi> The Soul in which Chriſt reſteth, is a flouriſhing Soul, the Church in which Chriſt reſteth, and in which he dwells, is a flouriſhing Church: whiles he walketh in the midſt of the Golden Candleſticks, they are full of light. If he withdraweth himſelf their light will be darkneſs. Give me leave a little to improve this argument with you to the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening up of your indeavours to the utmoſt, for the keeping of Chriſt in our Bed. I am the rather ingaged to it from the fears, that the experiences of late years, and the preſent juncture of affairs have created in me, that Chriſt is riſen up out of <hi>his Bed amongſt us.</hi> It was ſaid of old, That when the Church had wooden Challices, ſhe had golden Prieſts; but after ſhe came to golden Challices, ſhe had wooden Prieſts, I cannot ſay ſo for our late times. The Church of God amongſt us hath had golden Prieſts, I believe there was no Nation under Heaven, that in ſuch a ſpace of time enjoyed more of the Ordinances of God, more able Preachers, more powerful and Spiritual admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations. The <hi>Bed hath been lovely:</hi> or the Bedſtead rather, hath been ſo, but hath it been flouriſhing? how few Children have been all this time brought forth, unto God? The Lord help us. Thouſands have been perverted but how few have been converted? Thouſands carried off from the waies of God not ſo many tens brought into Chriſt? Where are the Souls have been convinced of fin, or converted to Chriſt? The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of our daies hath been to opinions, and factions, not to Jeſus Chriſt. Yet bleſſed be God it hath fared with us as with trees withering, which bring forth ſome ſmall proportions of fruit, though dwingling, as to the proportion, and not in ſo great plenty as formerly, but I am afraid we are yet growing worſe and worſe, ſure I am if the Lord withdraws his preſence from his Ordinances, it muſt be ſo, ſeeing you may ſee, and not perceive, hearing you may hear, and not underſtand. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks I ſee our Saviour (though now exalted at the right
<pb n="879" facs="tcp:61084:444"/>
hand of his Father) weeping over <hi>England,</hi> (as once over <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem)</hi> and ſaying, O <hi>England! England!</hi> thou that haſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed the Ordinances of God, and deſpiſed thoſe that have been ſent unto thee: <hi>how often would I have gathered thee, as an hen gathereth her Chickens under her wings: but thou would'ſt not. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold my houſe ſhall now be leſt deſolate.</hi> You may have Miniſters, and you may have Ordinances, but you ſhall not ſee me hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth till you ſay, <hi>bleſſed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.</hi> The pulſe of the Spirit in Ordinances, hath for many years, beaten faintly, now and then a ſtroke (like the pulſe of a dying man) I am afraid leſt the laſt ſtroke ſhould be nigh at hand. Where's the power, and preſence of God in our aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies? Where's the taking of Heaven by force, which former times experienced? Oh that the conſideration of the uneom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortableneſs of a deſolate ſanctuary, or dead Ordinanees in an open ſanctuary, might awaken you while yet you have hope to do what in you lies that Chriſt may be kept in his bed with you: it is true, the wind blows where it liſteth, and who can command the breathings of it? But yet, let there be nothing wanting in your indeavours, That if God ſhall meaſure out ſuch a diſpenſation, your Conſciences may not rebuke you; as wilful occaſioners of it. To this end give me leave to adviſe,</p>
               <p n="1">1.

The Jews would not be gathered, then Chriſt hid the things from them that concerned their peace. Chriſt in the laſt day of the feaſt cried. <hi>You would not come to me that you might have life.</hi> Firſt they would not, then he would not, you have had a Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel feaſt, poſſibly this may be the laſt day of it; this day Chriſt cries to you: Oh let him not go away with this dreadful word, you <hi>will not come to me that you may have life.</hi> Take heed of deſpiſing Ordinances, of ſlighting Chriſt and the means of grace: <hi>Take heed of ſhunning Chriſts Bed.</hi> How many are there that ſhy the Bedſtead, refuſe the Sanctuary, how dreadfully do theſe poor creatures deſpiſe their own mercies? Your daies of grace (for ought I know) may be very few, you had not need neglect them.

               <p>Whoſo conſidereth that the <hi>Beloved</hi> here mentioned <hi>is the King of glory,</hi> the Lord of Heaven and Earth, who dwells not in houſes made with hands, will eaſily conclude, it is no fabrick of wood and ſtone, (Chriſt when he was upon the Earth had no ſuch-place where to hide his head, and now the Heaven of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens contain him) that is here meant. True it is, that the Lord of old, choſe a particular houſe in which he was pleaſed more eminently to manifeſt his gracious preſence, in alluſion to which, his myſtical Spiritual habitation may poſſibly be called his houſe.

By the houſe here I find Interpreters generally underſtanding the <hi>aggregate body of Chriſtians,</hi> which we call the <hi>Church:</hi> properly enough called the <hi>Lords houſe,</hi> becauſe as a man dwelleth in his houſe, ſo the Lord is ſaid to <hi>dwell</hi> in his Church, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 16.

               </p>
               <p>This hath in this latter age of the World been found an hard matter to agree amongſt Perſons of different Notions. That the term <hi>Church,</hi> is a name of multitude, and that a <hi>Church,</hi> muſt be an <hi>aggregate body,</hi> is generally agreed; <hi>that it is a body of People called by God out of the World,</hi> is alſo as freely conſented to.

The Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant part of the Church, is that part of it, who (God having in the time of their life called them out of the Paganiſh and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing World and they afterward finiſhed their courſe) are called alſo by God out of this ſenſible, ſinful, elementary World to the enjoyment of himſelf in glory. Theſe are thrice called. 1. Out of the <hi>Pagan World,</hi> to the acknowledgment of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpel. 2. Out of the <hi>unbelieving World,</hi> to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
<pb n="886" facs="tcp:61084:448"/>
of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt and his Grace by true and lively Faith. 3. <hi>Out of the ſenſible ſinful World,</hi> to the <hi>Inheritance of glory.</hi> The other part of the Church, is that which is uſually called <hi>Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,</hi> and is the whole number of thoſe whom God hath called out of the <hi>Paganiſh World, to the acknowledgment of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>Doctrine of the Goſpel.</hi> This is again diſtinguiſhed into that which is <hi>Inviſible,</hi> and that which is <hi>Viſible.</hi> The Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible part is that whole number of men and women in the World, which the Lord by his Goſpel hath called <hi>out of darkneſs into mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velous light,</hi> out of a ſtate of Nature, into a ſtate of Grace. The Matter of this Church are men and women; the Form their <hi>Union</hi> in and with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. The <hi>Viſible Church</hi> is that about which the great quarrels have been: Some agreeing it to be the whole number of People over the face of the whole Earth, called out from a <hi>ſtate of Paganiſm,</hi> to the embracing of the Doctrine of the Goſpel.

               <p n="1">1. <hi>God is an holy God:</hi> Hence thoſe who are <hi>unholy,</hi> are not like to pleaſe him, nor he likely to continue long with them.

               <p>I Come to the ſecond Propoſition, which I have obſerved out of theſe words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop. 2.</hi> That the Word and Ordinances of God are the Beams and Rafters of his Houſe, which is his Church.</p>

                  <pb n="891" facs="tcp:61084:450"/>
So I choſe rather to interpret theſe <hi>metaphorical terms</hi> than (as ſome) concerning <hi>Perſons.</hi> I ſhall ſhew you the propriety of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor in a few particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Beams and Rafters</hi> are integral parts of an Houſe, indeed part of the ſubſtance of it, without which there can be no Houſe. An Houſe may want a due proportion of Beams and Rafters, and yet be an Houſe; but ſome there muſt be, ſome more principal <hi>Beams and Rafters,</hi> or there can be no Houſe; <hi>Without the Word and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of God, there can be no Church of God.</hi> Every company of men make not a Church, but a company owning the Word of God, and walking in the Fellowſhip of Ordinances; theſe make an Houſe of God. A Church may for a time (it may be for ſome long time) want ſome particular Ordinances, and yet be a true Church of God, but its ſtate muſt be lame and imperfect. But if it want all the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, if it wants the <hi>Word and Sacraments,</hi> which are the Church's Beams, it cannot be a Church of God. It is lame if it wants any Ordinance of God, but it loſeth the nature of a <hi>Church</hi> if it wants <hi>all Ordinances.</hi> That which makes a Church to be a Church, is Union and Fellowſhip; now the Word of God, and the Doctrine of Faith contained in the Word and the Ordinances for Worſhip and Order, are thoſe things in which the Church hath its Fellowſhip, by which the Members of the Church have Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip both with God, and alſo one with another.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Houſe is built upon Beams and Rafters, and they bear up the weight of the other materials.</hi> The weight of every Tile in the Houſe lies upon the Rafters, and the whole Building is laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>groundſel</hi> and <hi>dormans,</hi> and <hi>wall plates,</hi> and <hi>ſtudds;</hi> all which come under theſe two Notions of Beams and Rafters. The Church of God alſo is builded upon the Word of God; this is that which the Apoſtle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 20. calls the <hi>Foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets;</hi> the <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> of every particular Member of the Church is builded upon the Word of <hi>Promiſe,</hi> and the Word of <hi>Precept.</hi> Our <hi>Faith</hi> is built upon the Promiſes of the Word; our <hi>Obedience</hi> upon the Precepts, they are the <hi>Foundations,</hi> and <hi>Rule of all Holineſs.</hi> The whole weight of every particular Soul is laid upon the Word, and the weight of the whole Church lies upon the Word of God. Look as it is in an earthly houſe builded with the hands of men, if the Beams prove falſe or untruſty, or the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations prove unſure, the whole Building either ſinks and falls, or at leaſt ſways this or that way: So it is with the Church as to the
<pb n="892" facs="tcp:61084:451"/>
Word of God; yea ſo it is as to every particular Soul; the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the particular Soul, and the whole Fabrick of the Church, depends upon the <hi>truth, and ſureneſs, and permanency of the Word of God.</hi> If the Word of God ſhould not hold ſure, if the Truth of God could be found a Lye, all our Faith and Hope is in vain. The very notion of a Church is a <hi>Chimaera,</hi> and the greateſt concernments of it are buried up in ruines. It is the Word of God that is the Baſis of the Church, and the Baſis of every individual Soul, that is a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of that Church.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The Beams and Rafters of an Houſe, as they ſupport the burthen, and bear the weight of the Building: ſo they alſo unite the parts and ſides of it;</hi> they are the <hi>Mediums</hi> of Union to it; ſo is the <hi>Word and Ordinances</hi> to the Church: The Word is the Foundation upon which the Church, and every particular Soul is builded; and the Doctrine of Faith, and the Ordinances of God, are the means of <hi>Union</hi> in it. I do not think that an Explicit Covenant-Union, is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the conſtitution of a Church: I think that Union which the whole Church hath in the Profeſſion of the ſame Doctrine of Faith, and in the practice of the ſame Ordinances &amp; Rules of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, is ſufficient to make up ſuch an Union amongſt all Goſpel Profeſſors, as may juſtifie the denomination of a <hi>Catholick Church.</hi> And again, an agreement in the Profeſſion of the ſame Faith, and the practice of the ſame Ordinances in the ſame place, is enough to make up a particular Church of God. Look as in a Building, let the walls be at never ſo many foot diſtance one from another, yet the beams or dormans that go acroſs the Building, unite them together, and make them all but one and the ſame Building: So it is with the whole number of Profeſſors, ſcattered over the face of the whole Earth, though part of them be in <hi>England,</hi> part in <hi>France,</hi> part in <hi>Germany,</hi> part in other parts of the World, yet the ſame Doctrine and Profeſſion of Faith, and the practice of the ſame Ordinances of Worſhip running through them all, makes the whole but one Body, <hi>one Church,</hi> the Houſe of the Living God.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Look as it is with the <hi>Beams</hi> and <hi>Rafters;</hi> the <hi>purer,</hi> and <hi>ſtronger,</hi> and more <hi>ſubſtantial</hi> they are, and the more intire and homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneous they are, the ſtronger the Houſe is: So it is as to the Word and Ordinances of God; the purer the <hi>Doctrine of Faith,</hi> and <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances</hi> for Worſhip are, the ſtronger and better the Church is. If the Beams of an Houſe be ſappy, or rotten, or patched up of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral heterogeneous pieces, the weaker the Houſe is, and more ſubject
<pb n="893" facs="tcp:61084:451"/>
to fall, and to decay: So it is with the Church, which is the <hi>Houſe of the Living God.</hi> If the <hi>Doctrine of Faith, owned and profeſſed in it,</hi> be as it were <hi>heart of Oke,</hi> pure Doctrine, taken out of the heart of the Written Word, not ſappy through the additions of Humane Inventions, nor heterogeneous, part of it the pure Word of God, part of it the meer Fancies and Doctrines of men; if the Ordinances for Worſhip practiſed in it, be pure Ordinances, if the Tabernacle be <hi>according to the Pattern of the Mount,</hi> according to the form of ſound words, and pure Rule of the Goſpel, the Church is fair, and glorious, and ſtrong, the <hi>gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it;</hi> but if otherwiſe, if the Doctrine of Faith profeſſed in it be mingled with the Clay of Humane Fancies and Errours; if the Ordinances of Worſhip practiſed in it, be full of the ſap of Traditions and Ceremonies, the Church is a declining, decaying Church, and hath no ſtrength in her. The reaſon is, becauſe God will not continue with ſuch a Church. The Pſalmiſt ſaith of the Church, <hi>God is in the midſt of her, therefore ſhe ſhall not fall;</hi> now they muſt be <hi>golden Candleſticks</hi> in the midſt of <hi>which God walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi> But thus much may be ſufficient to ſhew you the propriety of the Metaphor. Let me ſhortly Apply this before I paſs on to the other Propoſition.</p>

                  <hi>Fidei, &amp; Cultus,</hi> the Foundation of <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Worſhip</hi> and <hi>Order,</hi> the Foundation of Doctrine and Ordinances, I ſay: And as no man can lay any other Foundation of Salvation than Chriſt; ſo neither can any lay any other Beams of <hi>Doctrine</hi> or <hi>Inſtitutions</hi> for <hi>Worſhip,</hi> but what Jeſus Chriſt hath laid. Chriſt, by himſelf, and by <hi>his Apoſtles,</hi> laid theſe Foundations and Beams of Doctrine and Worſhip; from the Goſpel of Chriſt, and the Writings of the Apoſtles muſt be drawn, the Articles for the firſt, and the <hi>Canons</hi> for the latter: And the whole Building of the Church de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon theſe Foundations and Beams. Let the Word of Faith, or the Purity of Worſhip fail from the Church, or any part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, it preſently ceaſeth to be a Church of God, and turns into an <hi>Antichriſtian Synagogue.</hi> Now I ſay, this commends to every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, the <hi>Doctrine of Faith,</hi> and the <hi>Ordinances of God.</hi> There is an Excellency in <hi>Entity</hi> or <hi>Being:</hi> Hence whatſoever it be which gives Being to a thing, and without which it would not be (at leaſt not ſuch) hath a great Excellency in it; and the more noble the thing is, to which Being is given, the more Excellent is the Form by which it hath ſuch Being. The Soul of man gives <hi>Being to a man:</hi> The Body without the Soul is but a lump of fleſh, a piece of Clay; the Soul informeth, and inliveneth, and giveth an Humane Being to it; ſeparate that from it, and the man is no more. Some Philoſophers have vainly dreamed of an <hi>Amma Mundi,</hi> a general Soul of the World, which ſhould give <hi>Form, Life, Motion to every part of the World.</hi> Now as the Soul of a man is more excellent than any Souls of Beaſts, becauſe it is the Principle of a more Noble Being, ſo (doubtleſs) if there were any ſuch Univerſal Soul, which gave Life, Being, Motion, Form, Union, to all the World, it would be a more excellent ſubſtance than any particular Soul is. But God himſelf ſupplieth that place. Now <hi>The Word and Ordinances of the Goſpel,</hi> though they be not <hi>Anima Mundi,</hi> the Soul of the World. Yet they are <hi>Anima E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>cleſiae,</hi> as it were the Soul of the Church of God, without which the Church would be no ſuch thing as the Church of the Living God: They are thoſe things which make the Church to be a <hi>Church;</hi> and the whole Church to be but one Church. Let this therefore engage every Chriſtian to prize the Word, and to prize the <hi>Ordinances</hi> of the Goſpel. That's the firſt Branch.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Uſe 2.</note> Hence in the ſecond place you may obſerve, what is a <hi>ſad Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of a decaying Church, and by this you may alſo diſcern a lame</hi>
                  <pb n="895" facs="tcp:61084:452"/>
                  <hi>and imperfect Church.</hi> Look as in a Building there are ſome more principal Beams and pieces of Timber, without which there can be no Houſe, no Building: Others that are integral parts, without which the Building is not compleat, yet the Houſe may be an Houſe, though lame and imperfect. So it is in this caſe, without the <hi>Doctrine of Faith,</hi> and ſome <hi>Ordinances of Worſhip,</hi> the Church is no Church. If any part of the <hi>Doctrine of Faith</hi> be wanting, or corrupted in a Church, the Church is (however true) yet lame and imperfect. Suppoſe a Church wholly want ſome Ordinances, (as ſome do the Ordinances of Eccleſiaſtical Cenſures) yet they are not by this made no Church, if they have the <hi>Doctrine of Faith,</hi> and <hi>ſome Ordinances of Worſhip;</hi> much leſs ought a Church to be ſo cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, for the temporary want or ſuſpenſion of the Exerciſe of ſome Ordinances, (which was the caſe of the Jewiſh Church in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs as to <hi>Circumciſion)</hi> but yet the Church that wanteth ſuch Ordinances is imperfect and lame. And again I ſay, this is a ſad Symptom of a <hi>decaying Church, when either the Doctrine of Faith, or Ordinances of Worſhip, are denied, or corrupted in it;</hi> for theſe are the <hi>Beams</hi> and <hi>Rafters</hi> of the Houſe; and every one grants that Houſe to be a decaying, declining Houſe, where the Beams and Rafters are rotten. We need no further Evidence of this than what we have in God's Epiſtles to the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> recorded by St. <hi>John</hi> in the ſecond and third Chapters of the <hi>Revelation.</hi> The Church of <hi>Smyrna</hi> was a decaying Church: The Doctrine of <hi>Balaam,</hi> and of the <hi>Nicolaitans</hi> was holden in it. The Church of <hi>Thyatira</hi> was a decaying Church, for the Woman <hi>Jezebel</hi> taught, and ſeduced the Servants of God in it. And but a while after, (theſe Rafters and Beams being decayed) theſe Houſes of God fell, and to this very day lie in their rubbiſh. From that time that <hi>Jeroboam</hi> ſet up the Calves at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> and the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> ſet up Altars in Groves, the Church of the Jews was a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining, decaying Church, and the Rulers of it, and Members of it having no heart timely to repair, and reform it, the Houſe fell. It is true, God raiſed it again after the Captivity, but it decaying the ſecond time, fell, and lies buried in its Ruines this day.</p>
               <p>Thirdly. From this Notion, may be drawn a great <hi>argument both for unity, and uniformity. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity in matters of faith. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in matters of practice.</hi> The Doctrine of <hi>unity</hi> in the Church of the Goſpel is exceedingly preſſed in Scripture, ſcarce is there any one of the Epiſtles of the Apoſtles, in which, it is not again
<pb n="896" facs="tcp:61084:453"/>
and again preſſed; <hi>Be of one mind:</hi> there is a double union, which is our duty to labour after. The firſt is <hi>unit as fidei:</hi> the unity of faith, <hi>as to the underſtanding.</hi> The ſecond is <hi>unit as Charit at is quoad affectum,</hi> the unity of Love, and Charity as to the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The latter of theſe hath been highly pleaded for in theſe ſinful, and wofully divided times: and indeed never more need of it, but it hath not been duly conſidered, that conſidering the corrupt ſtate of man, <hi>The former union muſt be the Mother of the latter.</hi> For as all love is founded in ſome <hi>ſimilitude,</hi> ſo this love and affection where it hath any where grown up to its due heighth, we ſhall find, hath been founded in the ſimilitude of underſtanding, and <hi>de facto</hi> it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that amongſt Chriſtians of different perſuaſions in the things of God, there hath ſeldom been an intireneſs of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial affection. Indeed theſe things ought not to be: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I do not Commend them, nor yet blame the exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of brethren of divided Principles to an union in affection, forbearing one another where all things have not been alike revealed to all; but ſuch is the corruption of our natures, that<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 10.</note> this is rather <hi>optandum,</hi> then <hi>ſperandum,</hi> to be wiſhed for rather than hoped, for if there could be <hi>unity</hi> in Judgment and <hi>unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in practice,</hi> (which the Apoſtle calls a thinking and a <hi>ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> the ſame things) the other union of affection would follow more readily: O let us labour for this. There is but one <hi>truth;</hi> but one <hi>true rule of Worſhip.</hi> This Doctrine, theſe rules are contained in the Word of God: theſe are the <hi>Beams</hi> and <hi>Rafters</hi> of the Church, and if the ſame <hi>Beams</hi> and <hi>Rafters</hi> run through the whole Church, and be upon every part of the roof, we may expect that the building ſhould be ſtrong, and durable; on the other ſide, the difference of theſe Beams and Rafters, whiles one Church holds one thing in ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ter of faith, another Church holdeth another thing; nay, whiles one particular Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian believes one thing, another Chriſtian believes another thing, whiles this Church, or this Chriſtian Worſhips God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter one way and order, another Church, or other Chriſtians, they Worſhip God after another way: though indeed it is poſſible their differences may not be ſo great, but they may yet agree in one and the ſame head, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo both parties differing may at leſt be ſaved, yea it may be their differences are not ſo great, but there may be a juſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing
<pb n="897" facs="tcp:61084:453"/>
one of another (provided all Chriſtians were of equal underſtandings, or that they rightly underſtood each other;) yet doubtleſs, this breach of <hi>unity,</hi> as to matters of Judgment, in things relating to the Doctrine of Faith, and breach of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi> as to matters of <hi>practice,</hi> is a great weakening of the Church of God, and much ſpoileth the beauty, and glory of it: O there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſtudy <hi>unity,</hi> and ſtudy <hi>uniformity:</hi> you ſtrengthen the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by both theſe, you weaken it, by dividing or diſagreeing (at leaſt to open notice.) It is to me very remarkable that St. <hi>Paul</hi> almoſt in every Epiſtle preſſeth theſe things, and <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 2.<note place="margin">Phil. 4. 2.</note> when but two <hi>women diſſented,</hi> he thought it worthy of his pains to perſuade them to it: I <hi>beſeech</hi> Euodias, <hi>and I beſeech</hi> Syntyche <hi>that they be of the ſame mind in the Lord.</hi> Doeſt thou therefore O Chriſtian, differ from other Chriſtians amongſt whom thou liveſt, in any <hi>matter of faith,</hi> or <hi>in any matter</hi> of <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,</hi> as to fellowſhip in Ordinances? ſit not down Satisfied, but labour for this unity, for this uniformity. And as means to it, let me but offer you my thoughts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I would have Chriſtians <hi>open hearted and free in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of their diſſents.</hi> It is one of the great plagues of our times, that Chriſtians are not free one with another, but lock up their private opinions, and make it a great piece of their art to conceal themſelves and to lurk under ambiguous phraſes, &amp;c. It is true ſome are too open: the Apoſtle Commands him that in an indifferent thing hath a particular <hi>faith, to have it to himſelf before God, Rom.</hi> 14. 22. that <hi>is to be underſtood</hi> as to the open publiſhing of it to the diſturbance of others, and the offence of the weak: but in the mean time (doubtleſs) a prudent diſcovery of ſuch diſſents, to able and faithful Perſons of a differing Judgment, would much contribute to the unity of Chriſtians.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Eſpecially 2dly, If they would be <hi>willing to be convinced,</hi> and to <hi>hear arguments againſt themſelves,</hi> to bring forth their ſtrong reaſons and to hear others bring forth theirs alſo: I know not how it comes to paſs, that Chriſtians who have Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſores, in their underſtandings and Judgments, are very loth to diſcover them, and are impatient of having them touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (at leaſt) at firſt, would Chriſtians be willing to take Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and give Satisfaction each to other, many of our dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences in Doctrine and practice would eaſily be compoſed;
<pb n="898" facs="tcp:61084:454"/>
eſpecially if to their mutual diſcourſes to this purpoſe they would but bring humble hearts, and <hi>pietatem diſcendi</hi> rather then <hi>diſcutiendi acumen,</hi> a pious mind to learn rather then a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire to ſhew their quaintneſs in arguing their own cauſe (which <hi>Auguſtine</hi> lamented that he did not do in his reading the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures whiles he was a young man.)</p>
               <p n="3">3. And 3dly, If to all this Chriſtians would add <hi>Prayer</hi> unto that God who <hi>revealeth</hi> truth to his People, it would highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to this unity I am pleading for, it is a piece of Chriſts interceſſion for us that we might be one.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And laſtly, Would Chriſtians (as becomes ſuch as are humble) <hi>if after all due means uſed for mutual Satisfaction, and attaining to this happineſs,</hi> but <hi>learn that piety and prudence which the Apoſtle Commands and reaſon dictateth,</hi> viz. <hi>To keep the things wherein they diſſent to themſelves and walk together ſo far forth, as they have mutually attained,</hi> and <hi>are mutually agreed:</hi> certainly this would go very far, and if this courſe did not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contribute to preſerve the <hi>ſtrength</hi> and <hi>beauty</hi> of the <hi>Beams,</hi> and <hi>Rafters,</hi> of Gods houſe amongſt us; yet the weakneſs of them, or rather indeed our weakneſs would not be ſo manifeſt to our enemies nor our nakedneſs ſo much diſcovered unto them that hate us.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Uſe 4.</note> Is the <hi>Doctrine of faith?</hi> And are the Ordinances of God, the Beams, and <hi>Rafters of the Church?</hi> How much are we then all concerned to keep them in their <hi>ſtrength,</hi> and <hi>purity,</hi> and <hi>beauty.</hi> We are Commanded to <hi>contend earneſtly for the faith, which was delivered once to the Saints, Jude.</hi> 3. and to ſtrive to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for the faith of the Goſpel, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 7. <hi>there is a ſtriving about words to no profit, but to the ſubverting of the hearers,</hi> which the Apoſtle warns <hi>Timothy</hi> againſt, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 14. and there is a ſtriving about <hi>things</hi> that are indifferent and it may be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on both ſides to be ſo. Theſe are vain janglings and unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable ſtrivings. But there is a ſtriving for the <hi>Doctrine of faith,</hi> againſt <hi>Haereticks,</hi> and erroneous Perſons, and there is a ſtriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a true <hi>Worſhip of God,</hi> and a pure adminiſtration of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, according to the rule of the word, without the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Ceremonies and humane Inventions. In theſe things Chriſtians that are members of the Church, ſtand highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to ſtrive: To ſtrive to maintain, the Word of God, and the Doctrines of faith contained in them, that they be not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
<pb n="899" facs="tcp:61084:454"/>
with the leaven of errour. And to maintain the Worſhip of God in its perfection, that no part of it be loft: and in its purity, that the adminiſtration of it be not mixed up with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane inventions: now to ſtrive for theſe things is a noble ſtriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and worthy of Chriſtians: for the Ordinances of God and the Word of God they are the Beams and Rafters of the houſe of God, and what man is there that doth not take himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to take care of the <hi>Beams</hi> and <hi>Rafters</hi> of hishouſe, that nothing comes to them which may expoſe them to a ſudden putrefaction and rotenneſs, and indanger the whole building to fall? If a Church defends the Doctrine of the Word, and the Ordinances of God, and maintains them in their ſtrength, beauty, purity, they will defend it. There can be no inſtance given of Gods leaving any Church, ſo long as the Doctrine of faith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in it incorrupted, and the Ordinances of God abode in it and were adminiſtred in their power, ſtrength and purity. But this is enough to have ſpoken to the 2d Propoſition: the 3d yet remains.</p>

               <p>I Am now come to the laſt Propoſition which I obſerved out of theſe Words, with which I ſhall cloſe my diſcourſes, both upon this verſe, and upon this whole Chapter. The point is this:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop. 3. There is a</hi> Beauty, Sweetneſs, Power and Efficacy, and an incorruptible nature in the Word and Ordinances of God.</p>
               <p>Theſe four things I noted to you concerning theſe two ſorts of wood to which the Spouſe here likeneth the Beams, and Rafters of the Church which is her, and her beloveds houſe:
<pb n="900" facs="tcp:61084:455"/>
Here are four things (in the Propoſition) praedicated of theſe Spiritual Rafters</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt is <hi>Beauty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Cedars, and Fir trees, are <hi>tall,</hi> and goodly trees, the latter loſe not their beauty in the Winter time. <hi>Zion</hi> of old was called <hi>the perfection of beauty, Pſal.</hi> 50. 2. <hi>ſtrength and beauty</hi> were ſaid to be <hi>in the Sanctuary, Pſal.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 50. 2. 96. 6. Rom. 10. 15.</note> 96. 6. the feet of them who bring glad tidings of peace are called <hi>beautiful, Rom.</hi> 10. 15. the Sanctuary indeed of old had an external beauty, it was full of Gold, and of rare work, which much pleaſed the carnal Eyes of the beholders. This beauty is ceaſed with the Jewiſh Worſhip. But there is a greater beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſtill remaining, the beauty of <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple in all its glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, was not like the beauty of Goſpel adminiſtration.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Beauty is a pleaſing thing.</hi> That which Satisfieth the luſt of the Eye, is that which we call carnal beauty: the orderly adminiſtration of Goſpel inſtitutions is <hi>a comely thing</hi> in the Eyes of a Spiritual Soul, the ſimplicity of the Goſpel adminiſtrations hinders not the beauty at all. The ſober, grown Perſon, thinks a ſuit of plain Spaniſh cloth, as beautiful, as the Child thinks its gay coat, whoſe colours it may be are more diverſe and the rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands about it of ſeveral colours, but the ſubſtance of it not of half ſo much value. 'Tis true the legal adminiſtrations were more gay, but though the trimming were more coſtly the cloth was not ſo good: They were all but <hi>ſhadows of things to come.</hi> The ſubſtance is ours. What ſober Perſon lives in a Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, where the Sabbaths of God are ſtrictly obſerved: where the Paſtor powerfully, plainly, clearly, gravely, Preacheth the wholeſome Doctrines of the Goſpel, Prays powerfully and Spiritually, where the Word of God is read, and the Sacraments duly and orderly adminiſtred, where <hi>Pſalms</hi> are daily ſung in a Spiritual manner; and the Ordinances of diſcipline, are prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and faithfully executed, and doth not ſee a great comelineſs in them, at which his Soul is pleaſed, and with which it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted?</p>
               <p n="2">2. As they are exceeding pleaſing to a Spiritual heart, ſo there is a <hi>lovely Majeſty in them, and alſo a great Symmetry and proportion.</hi> God hath ſtamped a certain ſecret Majeſty upon every holy inſtitution of his, which Commandeth love and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence for it, from all ſober Perſons, who have not outlawed both their reaſon and Religion too, and here again the plainneſs,
<pb n="901" facs="tcp:61084:455"/>
and ſimplicity of the Goſpel adminiſtrations gives advantage to them: beſides there is a great Symmetry in them: the word Preached is <hi>verbum audible,</hi> an audible word, the Sacrament is <hi>verbum viſible,</hi> a viſible word. When the Goſpel is Preached<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what is Preached but Chriſt crucified, and what is that which is repreſented in the <hi>Sacrament</hi> but a Chriſt crucified? The whole Goſpel adminiſtration is a goodly thing, and doth ſhine <hi>nativa luca</hi> in a certain native light of its own: and hath ſuch a lovelineſs attends the pure diſpenſation of it, that the ſuperad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of any humane inventions, is but like adding black patches to a lovely face, without which it was far more beautiful.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But laſtly the <hi>Beauty of the Word and Ordinances, of the Goſpel lies in this that the beauty of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.</hi> This is that which gives them luſtre. Obſerve holy <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 27. v. 4. <hi>one thing have I deſired of the Lord: that will I ſeek after that I may dwell in the houſe of the Lord all the daies of my life,</hi> to behold the beauty of the Lord, &amp; <hi>to enquire in his holy Temple.</hi> The gracious Soul ſees the Face of God in his Word, and the Image of Chriſt in Ordinances, this makes them lovely. Look as it is with the body; let it be never ſo good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a ſtructure, the lineaments of it never ſo proportioned, yet if the Soul informs it not, there is no beauty in it: So it is with Ordinances. Chriſt is the Soul of Ordinances, and it is only his ſtamp upon them, his preſence in them, which makes them lovely, and beautiful. Take the Word of God, as Chriſt is wrapt up in it, the Ordinances of God, as they are the inſtitutions of Chriſt and ſacred conduit pipes, and means, by which Chriſt conveys himſelf, and the influences of his grace, unto Peoples Souls; ſo they are exceeding beautiful: they are thoſe perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances in which the Soul ſeeth Chriſt, and meets with Chriſt; and this makes them goodly things.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The 2d thing which the Propoſition praedicates concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>word and Ordinances, is power and Efficacy,</hi> and <hi>uſefulneſs,</hi> I obſerved to you concerning <hi>Cedars,</hi> that as they had much <hi>beauty and</hi> goodlineſs in them: ſo they had much <hi>ſtrength in them,</hi> which made them very uſeful for Beams and Rafters, fit to bear the weight of materials in building laid upon them and to uphold the building. There is a wonderful power and vertue in the Word and Ordinances of God.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. There is in <hi>them a ſupporting power:</hi> They ſupport a Church. The Apoſtle ſaith that the Church is built upon the <hi>foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets, Eph.</hi> 2. the Church cannot ſtand with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them: they ſupport a <hi>particular Soul.</hi> The weight of poor Souls all lies upon the Word of God: how often doth holy <hi>David</hi> ſpeak to this in that excellent Pſalm, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. v. 49. <hi>Remember thy Word into thy ſervant upon which thou haſt cauſed me to hope,</hi> v. 15. <hi>This is my comfort in my affliction for thy Word hath quickened me,</hi> 81. <hi>My Soul fainteth for thy Salvation: but I hope in thy word,</hi> v. 92. <hi>unleſs thy love had been my delight I ſhould have periſhed in my affliction.</hi> Nay herein doth the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful power of the Word of God appear above the ſtrength of Cedars, you muſt Imagine a Cedar Beam of ſome proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble bigneſs to bear the great weight of a building, every ſtick of Cedar will not do it.

But further, there is a <hi>working power likewiſe, in the Word, and Ordinances;</hi> this is now more than is in a <hi>Cedar beam,</hi> that hath in it a great ſtrength, but it hath <hi>no life,</hi> it is an inanimate thing, and ſo worketh nothing, it beareth much, but hath no activity in it. <hi>The words which I ſpeak</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>are Spirit, and life.</hi> Indeed the life and Spirit which they have, is Chriſts <hi>life, Chriſts Spirit;</hi> without which they are but dead letters, and weak things, but from Chriſts concurrence with them, they have not only the forementioned power to uphold, and bear up a ſinking Soul, but they have an active, working power, to caſt down the <hi>ſtrong holds</hi> of the Soul (according to that of the Apoſtle 2. Cor. 10. 4) <hi>The Weapons of our warfare, are not carnal, but mighty through God, to the pulling down of ſtrong holds, caſting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth it ſelf againſt the knowledge of God, and bringing into Captivity every thought to the Obedience of Chriſt.</hi> But I ſhall not inlarge upon this being ſomething beyond my Metaphor.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third thing which my Propoſition predicateth of the
<pb n="903" facs="tcp:61084:456"/>
Word &amp; Ordinances of God is <hi>ſweetneſs.</hi> This is one thing which I obſerved to you concerning the <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The ſweetneſs of the <hi>Cedar</hi> is a gratefulneſs to the exterior ſenſes: But the ſweetneſs of the <hi>Word and Ordinances</hi> of God is <hi>intellectual,</hi> they are ſweet to the inward man. Which intellectual ſweetneſs is yet ſet out by ſimilitudes of ſenſible things, Pſal. 119. 103. <hi>How ſweet are thy words unto my taſt.</hi> What is ſweeter then <hi>honey ſaith Sampſon; Judg.</hi> 14. 18. Holy <hi>David</hi>

                  </gap>elleth him, Pſal. 19. 10. <hi>The word of God is ſweeter then the hony or the hony comb,</hi> and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 104. He doubleth the Expreſſion for the further confirmation of it. They are the words of God, that are the pleaſant words, of which <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 24. Pleaſant words are as an <hi>hony comb:</hi> Sweet to the Soul and <hi>health to the bones.</hi> The ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that reſulteth to the Spiritual ſenſe, from the word of God, ariſeth from two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt is that <hi>ſweet joy and peace, which God Ordinarily brings into the Soul from them. God will ſpeak peace to his People</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) and he creates <hi>the fruit of the lips peace, peace,</hi> (ſaith the Prophet;) this joy is indeed of different degrees, there is the <hi>rejoicing of hope,</hi> for hope growing from a true Root bringeth forth ſome fruit of joy in the Soul, though it indeed be not ſo fair and pleaſant a fruit as that joy which is the fruit of aſſurance, becauſe the Union which hope gives the Soul with its beloved object, is of the loweſt fort. But yet even this <hi>joy</hi> hath a great deal of ſweetneſs, but Oh! How great is that ſweetneſs which is the riper fruit of aſſurance, that peace which paſſeth all underſtanding; A ſweetneſs which oft times overcomes the Soul and is too great for it to bear. Both which the Soul reaps from the word of God and from the Ordinances of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But ſecondly this ſweetneſs in the <hi>Word and Ordinances of God</hi> ariſeth not from this alone, but from other uſefulneſs of them to the Soul. That is not only ſweet: but that alſo which is profitable, <hi>David</hi> ſaies, that the Law of the Lord doth <hi>convert</hi> the Soul, makes <hi>wiſe the ſimple, enlightens the Eyes,</hi> that they are uſeful to <hi>warn us,</hi> and that in <hi>keeping them there is great reward.</hi> By the word and the Ordinances of God the Soul hath wherewithal to anſwer the tempter, in that it finds ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to help it in repelling a ſecret motion to ſin, &amp;c.
<pb n="904" facs="tcp:61084:457"/>
This makes the Word and Ordinances of God exceeding ſweet to gracious Souls as they are thoſe things by which the Soul is profited.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But thirdly, there is a further ſweetneſs, that the Word, and Ordinances of God have to a gracious Soul, as they are <hi>pure and holy,</hi> Pſal. 119. v. 140. <hi>Thy word is very pure, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth thy ſervant love it.</hi> The heart of man (naturally) doth not love purity, but the Spiritual heart that is conformed to the image of God loves it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is turned into the likeneſs of the word, and made to love whatſoever is holy and Spiritual and pure. This makes the Rafters, and beams of the Church, to the true Chriſtian to be like Cedar and Fir, ſweet ſmelling, becauſe of that purity, and holineſs which cleaveth to them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A fourth thing which the Propoſition predicateth of the Word and Ordinances of God, is their duration, <hi>they are of an incorruptible Nature,</hi> as <hi>Cedar</hi> and <hi>Fir, or Pine:</hi> Not ſubject to corruption, and putrefaction as other ſorts of wood are, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40. <hi>v.</hi> 8. The graſs withereth, and the flower fadeth, but <hi>the Word of God ſhall ſtand for ever.</hi> Our Saviour ſpeaketh to this purpoſe, Heaven and Earth ſhall paſs away, <hi>but one jot or tittle of the Law ſhall not paſs away until all theſe be fulfilled.</hi> I will open this a little.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Ordinances of the Goſpel endure for ever.</hi> Herein the excellency of the Goſpel diſpenſation appeareth, above the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal diſpenſation. The Law brought nothing to perfection (faith the Apoſtle to the <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Jewiſh Prieſthood ceaſed; But the Goſpel Miniſtry continues, Chriſt hath promiſed to be with them to the <hi>End of the World,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 4 11, 12.</note> God hath given <hi>Apaſtles, Prophets, Evangeliſts, Paſtors, and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, for the perfecting of the Saints until we all come in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt.</hi> The paſſover was but for a time, until the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> The word of God in particular indureth for ever. <hi>I will open this in two things,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Propoſitions of the word indure for ever.</hi> They are <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of Eternal truth,</hi> whether they be <hi>Dogmatical Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> which aſſert the truth of God, concerning the Nature or will of God, or concerning the ſtate of man, or any thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to his <hi>duty,</hi> or whether they be ſuch as are <hi>promiſory,</hi> they are of an immortal Nature, the reaſon is, becauſe God is a God that changeth not, he is not Yea, and Nay, but Yea and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, a God that cannot lye to his People, nor repent of what he hath ſaid unto them. The truth of the word abideth for ever.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>vertue of the word abideth, and is immortal.</hi> The ſame vertue which the word of God ever had in it to convince, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert, to enlighten, quicken ſupport, comfort, the ſame is in it ſtill, and indeed the proof of this dependeth partly upon the former, for the vertue of the word, whether it be the word of precept, or the word of promiſe, doth much depend upon the <hi>truth of it.</hi> Now the truth of it being perpetual, the vertue of it muſt alſo be ſo, ſuppoſing the ſame concurrence of that holy Spirit which muſt be to make the Word of any uſe or vertue at any time, I have ſpoken enough to the Explication of the point; I come now to the Application of it; which I ſhall diſpatch, by drawing ſome ſpeculative and practical Inferences from what you have heard.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Uſe 1.</note> Hence (in the firſt place) you may obſerve a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt the <hi>Legal</hi> and the Goſpel <hi>Miniſtry;</hi> And (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently) the excellency of the latter above the former. The Apoſtle to the Hebrews inſiſteth much upon this, and by this argument proves the excellency of the Goſpel above the Law.

It is true, the Doctrine of the Law and Goſpel, the Propoſitions of truth, contained in both are much one and the ſame.

                  <note place="margin">Uſe 2.</note> 2. Obſerve from hence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>The blindneſs of many Peoples Eyes, and the hardneſs of our hearts,</hi> together with the <hi>unreaſonableneſs of unbelief.</hi> You have heard that there is a Beauty and a <hi>ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> in the Word and Ordinances of God, they are beautiful to the Eye, and they are <hi>ſweet</hi> unto the taſt and to the ſmell; the lips of Chriſt drop <hi>ſweet ſmelling Myrrh;</hi> what is the reaſon then that the moſt of People can taſt no ſweetneſs in them, nor ſee any beauty in them? Alas, the moſt men and women in the World have no more ſavour of a Sermon or Sacrament then in the white of an Egg: They ſee more beauty in a <hi>play-book,</hi> or an <hi>hiſtory,</hi> then they can ſee in the holy Word of God, the reaſon is this, they are void of <hi>Spiritudl ſenſes,</hi> they have their <hi>exteriour carnal ſenſes,</hi> they can taſt <hi>ſweetneſs</hi> in an <hi>Hony-Comb,</hi> but they have not any Spiritual ſenſe, they <hi>can taſt</hi> no ſweetneſs <hi>in the Word of God,</hi> which to <hi>Davids</hi> taſt was ſweeter then the Hony-comb.

2. As it diſcovers the want of Spiritual ſenſe, in an unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Soul, ſo it alſo diſcovers the <hi>hardneſs of mens hearts.</hi> The Word and Ordinances of God, have a <hi>power and Efficacy</hi> in them, but alas! how few do they make any impreſſion upon? But I ſhall not inſiſt upon this as not ſo proper to the reſemblance of the Text. Let me rather,</p>
               <p n="3">3. Infer the <hi>unreaſonableneſs of unbelief,</hi> from what you have heard, of the <hi>ſupporting power of the Word of God.</hi> The <hi>Word of God,</hi> is the greet ſupporter of Souls, under all afflictions, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, in all diſtreſſes and agonies, &amp;c. God is indeed pleaſed as to ſome of his People to give them in <hi>ſenſible evidences of his love,</hi> ſealing them up, (by way of aſſurance of his love) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the day of redemption: and bleſſed are they who are in ſuch a caſe, but this is not the portion of all the People of God, the moſt of Chriſtians have nothing but the royal Word of God to truſt to, and upon this all their hopes hang as to Eternity. And we are ſo carnal, that we find it an hard thing oft-times to keep up the building of grace, faith and hope, upon this foundation, but are ready to ſway, and ſink through diſtruſt and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, through unbelief, and anxiety of thoughts, &amp;c. This is that which we call unbelief. The unreaſonableneſs of which is ſufficiently evidenced from the ſtability of the Word of God, it is a <hi>Beam of Cedar.</hi> Thou that thinkeſt it an hard thing, to have nothing but a bare Word of God to truſt to, unleſs thou haſt ſome ſenſible evidence, that canſt not believe without a ſign, conſider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Word is the <hi>Beam</hi> of the Church. The whole Church of God is built upon the Word; it is that which God hath judged ſufficient at all times for his People: God the Father had no more than Chriſt's word for the price of all the Souls that were ſaved, from the beginning of the World, until the time of Chriſt's Death and Paſſion, (when the price was actually paid into God's hand.) All the Believers that were ſaved, from <hi>Adam</hi> till Chriſt's coming in the Fleſh, had no more to truſt to for their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, than the Royal Word of God; <hi>That the Seed of the Woman ſhould break the Serpents head: That a Meſſiah ſhould come and be ſlain to make reconciliation for iniquity,</hi> &amp;c. They all truſted on theſe words of God, and were ſaved.</p>

immutable things: It muſt needs be ſo, becauſe of the immutable Nature of God; he is a God that <hi>cannot lye,</hi> that cannot ſpeak that which is falſe; he is a God that cannot <hi>repent;</hi> he cannot, like man, <hi>eat his word,</hi> or recede from it. <hi>David</hi> ſaith, That <hi>the Word of the Lord is ſettled in the Heavens.</hi> The Graſs may wither, and the Flower may fade, but the Word of the Lord muſt ſtand for ever. Heaven and Earth ſhall paſs away, but one jot or tittle thereof cannot fail. Hath he ſaid it, and ſhall he not do it? Hath he ſpoken it, and <hi>ſhall not</hi> he bring it to paſs?

               <p n="3">3. It is a <hi>Beam that never yet brake;</hi> never Soul miſcarried that truſted its whole weight upon it. What greater Arguments can any have to perſuade his Soul to truſt to the Word of God, than theſe two.</p>

                  <hi>Firſt;</hi> That the Nature of the word is ſuch that it cannot fail. <hi>The truth of God cannot be turned into a lye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly; <hi>That no inſtance can be produced of any Soul that miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in its confidence.</hi> Look over all the Book of God, and find me Gods Word given to any Soul, for anything, whether temporal, or ſpiritual, and it was not made good unto him: indeed <hi>the Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> have ſometime tarried beyond the patience of God's People, but they have alwaies been fulfilled in their ſeaſons.</p>

Conſider how <hi>unreaſonable a thing it is, that thou ſhouldeſt truſt to the word of a man,</hi> and diſtruſt the <hi>Word of a God?</hi> You think your ſelves concerned to truſt in the <hi>Royal word of a King,</hi> in the ſerious word of a Noble Perſon, in the word of an ordinary Friend who is but accounted morally honeſt, how unreaſonable a thing then is it, that thou ſhouldeſt not take the word of a God, the word of him who cannot lye? To ſum up this then Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, what though thou haſt nothing but the word of God to truſt to, either for thoſe things which concern thee as to this Life, or for thoſe things which concern thee as to another Life; yet the Word of God is enough; it is the Beam of <hi>Chriſt's Houſe,</hi> and it is a Beam of Cedar, which cannot corrupt or putrifie, nor fail for ever. Nor indeed</p>
               <p n="5">5. Is that <hi>Aſſurance</hi> (of things not ſeen) which God gives to any Soul, any thing more than the ſealing, and particular appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Word.

ſtrength to the Word, only helps me to bear my ſelf upon it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Is there ſuch a <hi>Beauty, Sweetneſs, Strength</hi> and <hi>Power;</hi> and ſuch an <hi>incorruptible</hi> and <hi>immortal Nature</hi> in the Word of God, and in the <hi>Ordinances of God?</hi> Oh that theſe things might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them more to all you that hear me this day! Under this head let me plead with you for theſe things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>For a knowledge and underſtanding of, and an acquaintance with the Word of God.</hi> Let the beauty of an Object be never ſo perfect, it pleaſeth not me, if I look not upon it, or looking upon it, do not obſerve and underſtand it! Let the <hi>ſweetneſs of an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject be never ſo great,</hi> it affords me no pleaſure unleſs I taſt it. Let the power and efficacy of a thing be never ſo much, it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to me if I make no application of my ſelf to it, or it to me. And in very deed this is the reaſon why the moſt poor Souls ſee no beauty, underſtand no ſweetneſs in the Word of God, why they feel nothing of the power and ſtrength of it, becauſe they ſeldom look into it; or if they read in it, and attend upon it, they obſerve not what they read and hear; they underſtand not the Myſteries of the Goſpel; they make no appplications of the Word of God to their Souls, nor of their Souls to the Word, and try not the ſtrength of it: Oh let the Word of God be precious to you! Read it, and read it over and over again, thou wilt every time diſcern ſome ſweetneſs in it, which before thou didſt not diſcern; hear it; and hear it often; obſerve what thou readeſt, and what thou heareſt; get underſtanding in the Lord's Statutes; make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the Word to thy Soul, and of thy Soul to the Word. When thou art in ſtraights as to thy outward condition, or as to thy ſpiritual condition, thou wilt then find this <hi>ſweetneſs, beauty, power</hi> and <hi>efficacy</hi> in the <hi>Word,</hi> which till that time affords but matter of diſcourſe to thee.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let this plead with you for a <hi>due Attendance upon Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi> The <hi>Word,</hi> the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> every Ordinance of the Goſpel, they are the <hi>Beams and Rafters of the Church,</hi> which deſerve all your care and diligence to uphold and maintain, and to keep up in their perfect ſtrength glory and beauty: They are <hi>Beams of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar, and Raferes of Fir;</hi> they have a ſweetneſs, beauty and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency in them; and this beauty and excellency which is in them, will not be diſcerned by the Soul that neglects its Attendance upon them.</p>
