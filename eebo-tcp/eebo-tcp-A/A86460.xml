            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Who dyed of the Small Pox.</head>
            <head>AN ELEGIE.</head>
            <l>SCarce have I dry'd my Cheeks, but Griefs invite</l>
            <l>Again my Eyes to weep, my Hand to write,</l>
            <l>Which ſtill return with greater force, being more</l>
            <l>In weight and number then they were before.</l>
            <l>Mechanick Griefs are eloquent, their ſound</l>
            <l>Beats through the ſtreets, and in that ſpacious Round</l>
            <l>Salutes each ſtrangers eare: Nor can ſo high</l>
            <l>And wide a Ruine in one Family</l>
            <l>Contracted keep; but ſeeking farther bounds,</l>
            <l>Fills every breſt with its afflicting ſounds.</l>
            <l>Youth met with Beauty weeps; then who forbears</l>
            <l>To Griefe's Exchequer to bring in his tears?</l>
            <l>Het that ſuch tributes doth not now returne,</l>
            <l>Knows neither Vertue, nor for whom we mourn,</l>
            <l>SHE, whoſe unequall'd, and whoſe rich deſert</l>
            <l>Did take poſſeſſion in each knowing heart;</l>
            <l>Whoſe life was ſuch, it may be well deny'd,</l>
            <l>That ſhe did ever ill, but that ſhe dy'd.</l>
            <l>SHE, like another Nature, but whoſe Name</l>
            <l>Gave life to Beauty, and a voyce to Fame;</l>
            <l>SHE, whoſe pure worth was ſuch, whom gone, that even</l>
            <l>Heav'n would lament with many a tear, if Heaven</l>
            <l>Had not aſſum'd her, who in all ſhe did,</l>
            <l>Both Grace in it and Innocence were hid,</l>

            <l>Did here begin to ſtartle, and did ſeeme</l>
            <l>To feare her Beauties would now conquer him:</l>
            <l>Therefore a danger to prevent ſo nigh,</l>
            <l>Drew forth at once all his Artillery,</l>
            <l>And ſo direct the Battery was laid,</l>
            <l>So full the Charge, ſo faſt the Caſe-ſhot play'd,</l>
            <l>That the poor Body fell upon the place,</l>
            <l>A thouſand wounds being printed on her face:</l>
            <l>Yet ſpight of Death, and Fate, we muſt imply,</l>
            <l>That ſhe her ſelfe was well content to dye;</l>
            <l>For in this ſad and tedious vale of Teares,</l>
            <l>Ere ſhe had hardly numbred eighteene yeeres,</l>
            <l>She had done all her buſineſſe, and made even</l>
            <l>With Earth, and drawn up her accounts for Heaven.</l>
            <l>Rich in her Sexes value, good mens praiſe,</l>
            <l>And full of all could be deſir'd, but dayes;</l>
            <l>Where after her we ſigh our ſoules, the while</l>
            <l>She counts our teares, and with a pittying ſmile</l>
            <l>Beholds our following Love; and now no Drums,</l>
            <l>Nor voyce of Cannons, nor of Trumpets comes</l>
            <l>To vex her quiet eare; nor any noyſe</l>
            <l>Dares once approach to interrupt her joyes;</l>
