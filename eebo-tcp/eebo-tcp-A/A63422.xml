            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>n the West of <hi>Ireland,</hi> one <hi>James Steward</hi> riding by the Sea-side, as the Tide was comming in, perceived at a dist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance something of a strange bigness to make towards the shore: At first he apprehended it might be some Horse that might have been caught away with the violence of the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42369:3"/>
Tide, and having recovered himself was now swiming to Land, but approaching nearer on a closer view, he was infinitely surprized &amp; amazed, not so much at the bigness (which yet he found to exceed that of a Horse which he first took it for in the Body) as at the uncouth shape, and a number of strange Horns of great length, which rendered it not a little terrible to behold: Insomuch that he durst not go nearer to it, least it should destroy both him and his Horse, wherefore rideing off, he went immediately to one <hi>Tompson</hi> that dwelt hard by on the Beach, and acquainting him with this strange adventure desired his Aid, and that he would bring Ropes and Handspikes with him, and what other help he could procure, but there being none at that time at home but himself and his wife, they could not get any other assistance; However they two went down with him to the place, where the Man and his Wife were both almost astonisht at the sight of this strange Monster, and the Woman especially so far frighted that she would by no means permit her Husband should go neer or meddle with it, yet <hi>Steward</hi> the first discoverer, boldly adventured to ride up pretty near it, and at last to touch it with a Rope, and found it made no resistance, but lay stranded on the Ground, and wanted water to carry it off. Upon this <hi>Tompson</hi> and his Wife, seeing it so peaceable and inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive, grew couragious and came neer to assist the other man, and by their joynt Labour they got their Ropes so about it as they tumbled it over and were able to Hale it further on shore; during all which time it made no resistance, but when they went to lay hold on the Horns, they found thereon Shells like Coronets with Teeth within them which got hold of their hands and fingers, so that they were glad to let them go. And the Night comming on, they were forced for that time to leave it, having dragg'd it quite upon dry Land. Early next morning they return with more Company, whom the noise of this rare Accident soon drew together. But
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42369:4"/>
at their coming find the Monster quite dead, and now had time to view, and not without wonder, consider it's wonderful and prodigious shape, which they found as follows.</p>
            <p>The Length of this Sea-wonder, Horns and all, was full Nineteen foot, and in Bulk or Bigness of Body some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what larger then a Horse. It had two heads, the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest of which joyning immediately to the Body, had no perfect distinct shape; but like a vast lump, wherein nothing plainly appeared but two Eyes of an Oval form and of Extraordinary Bigness, this great head carryed the Horns, ten in number, of which the two longest were situated in the middle, and were smooth; the other eight, <hi>Viz.</hi> Four on each side were all wreathed or crooked, and upon them there grew curious shells (as it were) of the bigness of a large Clock Button, but in form and shape like Crowns or Coronets, two and two together and over against each other, to the number of one hundred in all on each Horn; on the top of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of these Buttons or Coronets, was the resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of a pearl which was to open and shut as a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Mouth, and had within it a row of Teeth, so that it should seem (beside the mouth of the little Head which we shall describe by and by) this Monster re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived nourishment for its Body at eight hundred seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral places, for to that number or thereabouts did the Crowns on all the eight Horns amount: Besides, it had a natural power to contract or draw in these Horns into it's Head, (as a Snail does) and extend them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain at pleasure. But when it was dead they all stood out at their full length, some of them being eight or ten foot long, and the two longest which were of equal size and length eleven foot.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:42369:4"/>
Between these two smooth longest Horns, and in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of all the rest, grew up from the great head, the little or smaller head, at about three or four foot distance; this was in shape much like the head of a Hawk, looking upward, and had a strange mouth, and two tongues in it, and here too, no doubt it did take in much of its nourishment.</p>
            <p>The Body it self, besides the Horns, was about eight or nine foot long, it was altogether smooth without Scales, Fins, or Legs, and all over of a flesh-colour, save only a large fleshy skin like a mantle, which was fast to the back, but hung down loose on both sides with a fringe round at bottom; and this was of bright red or the out-side, and perfect white within: This mantle was generally supposed to be its chief support in swiming, for it had not one bone in or about, nor any tail, but towards the lower end it grew sharp like a wedge.</p>
            <p>In brief, every thing in the said Monster was wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; the Liver being taken out, is credibly reported to have weighed thirty pounds; for experiment the people boiled some of the flesh, but the longer it boiled, the harder it became; it gave a very good scent as it boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and seemed fat, but in boiling the fat hardned, and no Creature (though several at divers times were tryed) would eat a bit of it, or so much as tast of it.</p>
            <p>A true Draught of this rare Animal, together with one of its heads, and two of its Horns, was carried to <hi>Dublin,</hi> the 16 of <hi>December</hi> last; and presented to several persons of Honour, since which time there is leave granted by Authority for the publique shewing thereof; both in <hi>Dublin,</hi> and other places.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:42369:5"/>
               <hi>We might now divert the Reader a little, and tell him, that some Zealots hearing of a strange Creature with several Heads, ten Horns, and more then tripple Crowns, took it for the Apocaliptical Beast, and fancied the Pope was land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Person; But—</hi>Non bonum est Ludere cum Sanctis, <hi>we dare not prophain a Text for a Jest, nor play the fool with Thunderbolts, and hope none will be so impertinently vain, as to place every strange production in Nature to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Prodigies, since, if we consider how large a share the Sea makes of this inferiour Globe, and that Nature is ever active and wonderfully fruitful, we may not irrationally conclude, or at least suspect the Ocean to be inhabited with as many several species of Creatures, as the Earth; and that the vast wilderness of Waters contains as many Monsters, and altogether as strange ones, as any in the Desarts of</hi> Afrique.</p>
