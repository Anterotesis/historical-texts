            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Passing ouer many daies in this muse, at last I perceiued mens humors slept, that loue of many friends followed no farther then their graues, that Art was growen idle, and either choice schollers feared to write of so high a subiect as his vertues, or else they dated their deuotions no further then his life. While thus I debated with my selfe, I might see (to the great disgrace of the Poets of our time) some Mycanicall wits blow vp mountaines, and bring forth mise, who with their follies did ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther disparage his Honors, than decypher his vertues: beside, as <hi>Virtutis comes est inuidia,</hi> so base report who hath her tong bli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stered by slanderous enuie, began as farre as she durst, now after his death, to murmure, who in his life time durst not once mutter: whervpon touched with a Zealous iealousie ouer his wonderfull ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, I could not, whatsoeuer discredit I reapt by my presumption, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I did <hi>Tenui Auena meditari,</hi> but discouer the honorable

qualities of so worthie a Counsellor, not for anie priuat benefit I euer had of him, which should induce me fauorably to flatter his worthie partes, but onely that I shame to let slip with silence, the vertues and honors of so worthie a knight, whose deserts had bin so many and so great towards al. Therfore (right worshipful Ladie) I drewe a fictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> called <hi>A Maidens Dreame,</hi> which as it is <hi>Enigmaticall,</hi> so it is not without some speciall and considerate reasons. Whose slender <hi>Muse</hi> I present vnto your Ladiship, induced therunto, first, that I know you are partaker of your husbands sorrowes, for the death of his honourable Vncle, and desire to heare his honors put in memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie after his death, as you wished his aduancement in vertues to be great in his life: as also that I am your Ladiships poore Countrima<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and haue long time desired to gratifie your right worshipfull father with some thing worthie himselfe. Which because I could not to my content performe, I haue now taken oportunitie to shew my duetie to him in his daughter, although the gift be farre too meane for so worshipfull and vertuous a Lady. Yet hoping your Ladishippe will with courtesie fauour my presuming follies, and in gratious acceptance vouch of my well meant labours, I humbly take my leaue.</p>
