            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

against sinners, and yet that sinne, that broad way-path and highway to hell, is attempted with a delectation and pleasure so craftie and subtill are the baits and lures of the deceiuer, and so void of spirituall wisedome is the soule-murdering sinner. But if due consideration were had of the wages of sinne, and the reward of vnrighteousnesse, and to what bitternesse it will turne in the end, it would make vs lesse bold to sinne, and more fearefull to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, if we would take into our company for a daily consort, the pale memory of death, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to he summoneth vs after this life.

vnto. Imagine to see a sinner lye on his departing bed, burde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and tyred with the grieuous and heauie load of all his former trespasses, goared with the sting and pricke of a festered consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, feeling the crampe of death wresting at his heart strings, ready to make the ruthfull di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorce betweene soule and body, panting for breath, and swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in a cold and fatall sweat, wearied with strugling against the deadly pangs: Oh how much would he giue for an houre of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance! at what rate would he value a daies contrition! Then worlds would be worthlesse, in respect of a little respite, a short truce would seeme more precious than the treasures of Empires,
<pb facs="tcp:12409:4"/>
nothing would be so much estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as a moment of time, which non by moneths and yeeres is la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uishly spent.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:12409:4"/>
perfect register of all his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeds: when hee should see the Iudge prepared to passe the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence against him, and the same to be his Vmpire, whom by so many offences he hath made his enemie: When not onely the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils, but euen the Angels, should plead against him, and himselfe maugre his will, bee his owne sharpest appeacher: What were to be done in these dreadfull exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents?</p>
                  <p>When hee saw that gastly dungeon and huge gulfe of hell, breaking out with fearefull flames, the weeping, houling, and gnashing of teeth, the rage of all those hellish monsters, the horrour of the place, the rigour of the paine, the terrour of the
<pb facs="tcp:12409:5"/>
company, and the eternitie of all those punishments. Would you thinke them wise that would daily in so weighty matters, and idlely play away the time allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to preuent these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable calamities? Would you then account it secure, to nurse in your bosome so many vgly Serpents as sinnes are, or to foster in your soule so many malicious accusers, as mortall faults are?</p>
                  <p>Would you not then thinke one life too little to repent for so many iniquities, euerie one whereof, were enough to cast you into those euerlasting and vnspeakeable torments? Why then doe we not (at the least) deuote that small remnant of
<pb facs="tcp:12409:5"/>
these our latter dayes, to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an attonement with God, that our consciences may be free from this eternall danger? Who would relie the euerlasting affaires of the life to come, vpon the gliding, slipperinesse; and running streame of our vncertaine life?</p>
                  <p>It is a preposterous pollicie (in any wise conceit) to fight against God till our weapons be blunted, our forces consumed, our limmes impotent, and our breath spent; and then when we fall for faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and haue fought our selues almost dead, to presume on his mercy. It were a strange peece of Art, and a very exorbitant course, while the Ship is sound, the Pylot well, the Marriners strong, the gale fauourable, and the Sea calme,
<pb facs="tcp:12409:6"/>
to lye idle at rode: and when the Ship leakes, the Pylot were sicke, the Marriners faint, the stormes boysterous, and the Sea turmoyled with surges, to launch forth for a voyage into a farre Country: yet such is the skill of our euening re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters, who though in the sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of health, and in the perfect vse of reason, they cannot resolue to weigh the ankers that withhold them from God, neuerthelesse, feed themselues with a strong per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion, that when their sences are astonied, their wits distracted, their vnderstanding dusked, and both body and minde racked and tormented with the throbs and gripes of a mortall sicknesse, then will they thnke of the weightiest matters, and become Saints, when
<pb facs="tcp:12409:6"/>
they are scarse able to behaue themselues like reasonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? being then presumed to be lesse then men: for how can he that is assaulted with an vnsetled conscience, distrained with the wringing fits of his dying flesh, maimed in all his abilities, and circled in with so many encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances, be thought of due discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to dispose of his chiefest iewell, which is his soule? No, no, they that will loyter in seed time, and begin then to sowe when others begin to reape: they that will riot out their health, and cast their accounts when they can scarsely speake: they that will slumber out the day, and enter their iourney when the light doth faile them, let them blame their owne folly, if they dye
<pb facs="tcp:12409:7"/>
in debt, and eternall beggerie, and fall headlong into the lapse of end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse perdition.</p>
                  <p>Great cause haue wee then to haue an hourely watchfull care ouer our soule, being so dangerous assaulted and enuironed: most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly entreating the diuine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty to be our assured defence, and let vs passe the day in mourning, the night in watching and wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and our whole time in plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full lamenting, falling downe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ground humbled in sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloath and ashes, hauing lost the garment of Christ, that hee may receiue what the persecuting ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my would haue spoyled, euery short sigh will not be sufficient satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, nor euery knocke a warrant to get in. Many shall cry Lord,
<pb facs="tcp:12409:7"/>
Lord, and shall not be accepted: the foolish Virgins did knocke, but were not admitted: <hi>Iudas</hi> had some sorrow, and yet died despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. Foreslow not (saith the holy Ghost) to be conuerted vnto God, and make not a daily lingering of thy repaire vnto him: for thou shalt finde the suddennesse of his wrath and reuenge not slacke to destroy sinners. For which cause, let no man soiourne long in sinfull securitie, or post ouer his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance vntill feare enforce him to it, but let vs frame our premises as we would finde our conclusion, endeauouring to liue as we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to dye: let vs not offer the maine cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

To satisfie
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:12409:24"/>
thee herein, I will also explaine vnto thee what may answere thy desire. For although our Lord do reserue the best wine, and the delicate dishes of most delight, vntill the end of the banket, yet he suffereth not his friends to bee vtterly destitute of meate and drinke in this tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous voyage: for hee knoweth very well, that they could not otherwise hold out in their iourney. And therefore when he said vnto <hi>Abraham,</hi> Feare not <hi>Abraham,</hi> for I am thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender, and thy reward shall be exceeding great: By these words he promised two things, the one for the time present, that was, to bee his safegard and defence in all such things as
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:12409:24"/>
may happen in this life; and the other for the time to come, and that is, the reward of glory which is reserued for the next life. But how great the first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise is, and how many kinds of benefits and fauours are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in included, no man is able to vnderstand, but onely he, that hath with great diligence read the holy Scriptures, wherein no one thing is more often repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and set forth, than the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the fauours, benefits, and priuiledges, which Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God promiseth vnto his friends in this life. Hearken what <hi>Salomon</hi> saith in the third chapter of his Prouerbs, as touching this matter. <hi>Blessed is that man that findeth wisdome,</hi>
                              <pb n="26" facs="tcp:12409:25"/>

Doest thou thinke it then a good exchange, to forsake the wayes of Almighty God, for the waies of the world, sith there is so great difference betweene the one and the other, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the end of the way, but also
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:12409:26"/>
in all the steps of the same? What madnesse can be greater, than to choose one torment, to gaine another by; rather than with one rest to gaine another rest? And that thou maist more clearely perceiue the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of this rest, and what a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of benefits are presently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident thereunto, I beseech thee harken attentiuely euen what Almighty God himselfe hath promised by his Prophet <hi>Esay,</hi> to the obseruers of his law, in a manner with these words, as diuers interpreters doe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound them. When thou shalt doe (saith hee) such and such things, which I haue comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thee to doe, there shall forthwith appeare vnto thee
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:12409:26"/>
the dawning of the cleare day (that is, the sonne of iustice) which shall driue away all the darkenesse of thy errours and miseries, and then shalt thou begin to enioy true and perfit saluation. Now these are the benefits which Almighty God hath promised to his seruants. And albeit some of them be for the time to come, yet are some of them to be presently receiued in this life: as, that new light and shining from heauen; that safety and abundance of all good things; that assured confidence and trust in the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God; that diuine assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in all our Prayers and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions made vnto him; that peace and tranquility of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:12409:27"/>
that protection and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence of Almighty God. All these are the gracious gifts and fauours which Almighty God hath promised to his seruants in this life. They all are the works of his mercy, effects of his grace, testimonies of his loue, and blessings, which he of his father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prouidence extendeth.</p>
                           <p>To be short, all these benefits doe the godly inioy both in this present life, and in the life to come: and of all these are the vngodly depriued, both in the one life, and in the other. Whereby thou maist easily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, what difference there is betweene the one sort and the other, seeing the one is so rich in graces, and the other so
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:12409:27"/>
poore and needy: For if thou ponder well Gods promised blessings, and consider the state and condition of the good and the wicked, thou shalt find, that the one sort is highly in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of Almighty God, and the other deepely in his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure: the one be his friends, and the other his enemies: the one be in light, and the other in darkenesse: the one doe enioy the company of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and the other the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy pleasures and delights of Swine: the one are truely free, and Lords ouer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and the other are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come bondslaues vnto Sathan, and vnto their owne lusts and appetites.

with the witnesse of a good conscience, and the other (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they bee vtterly blinded) are continually bitten with the worme of conscience, euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more gnawing on them: the one in tribulation, stand sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastly in their proper place; and the other, like light chaffe, are carried vp and downe with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery blast of winde: the one stand secure and firme with the anker of hope, and the other are vnstable, &amp; evermore yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto the assaults of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune: the prayers of the one are acceptable &amp; liking vnto God, and the praiers of the other are abhorred and accursed: the death of the one is quiet, peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and precious in the sight
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:12409:28"/>
of God, and the death of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is vnquiet, painefull, and troubled with a thousand frights and terrours: To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, the one liue like children vnder the protection and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Almighty God, and sleepe sweetly vnder the shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of his pastorall proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; and the other being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from this kinde of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, wander abroad as strai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed sheepe, without their sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard and Master, lying wide open to all the perils, dangers, and assaults of the world. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then, that a vertuous life is accompanied with all these benefits, what is the cause that should withdraw thee, and perswade thee not to

To say that thou art an enemy vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy selfe, and that thou doest not desire these benefits, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, considering that a man is euen naturally a friend to himselfe, &amp; the will of man hath euer an eye to his owne benefit, which is the very obiect or mark that his desire shooteth at. To say that thou hast no vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,

nor taste of these benefits, it wil not serue to discharge thine offence, for somuch as thou hast the faith and beleefe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, though thou hast not the taste, for the taste is lost through sinne, but not the faith: and the faith is a witnesse more certaine, moresecure, and better to be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted, than all other experiences and witnesses in the world. Why doest thou not then dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit all other witnesses with this one assured testimony? Why doest thou not rather giue credit vnto faith, than to thine owne opinion and iudgement?

sweet Sauiour Iesus Christ, when he tooke vpon him to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie for the debt that we owed. And if this seuerity was vsed vpon greene and innocent wood, and that for the sinnes of others; what then will he doe vpon dry and withered wood, and against those that are loden with their owne sinnes?

We see daily many starres fall downe from heauen vnto earth, with miserable fals, and to wallow themselues in the durt, and to eat the meat of swine, which sate before at Gods owne table, and were fed with the very bread of Angels. If then the iust and righteous

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:12409:70"/>
for such persons as be rebels and transgressours of his Law. For although the hope of the rewards that are promised vnto the good in the life to come, may moue vs very much here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: yet are we commonly more moued with things that beirkesome vnto vs, than with such as be pleasant: euen as we see by daily experience, that we are vexed more with an iniury done vnto vs, than delighted with any honour; and we are more troubled with sicknesse, than comforted with health: and so by the discommodity of sicknesse, we come to vnderstand the commodity of health, as by a thing so much the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter perceiued, by how much
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:12409:71"/>
more it is sensibly felt. Now for this cause did our Lord in times past vse this meane more than any other, as it appeareth most clearely by the writings of the Prophets, which are euery where full of dreadfull sayings and threatnings, wherewith our Lord pretendeth to put a terrour into the hearts of men, and so to bridle and subdue them vnder the obedience of his Law. And for this end he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Prophet <hi>Ieremie,</hi> That he should take a white booke, and write in the same all the threatnings and calamities which hee had reuealed vnto him, euen from the first day he began to talke with him, vntill that present houre, and that he
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:12409:71"/>
should read the same in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of all the people, to see if peraduenture they would be moued therewith vnto repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and to change their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer life, to the end, that he might also change the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of his wrath, which he had purposed to execute vpon them. And the holy Scripture saith, That when the Prophet had done according as he was commanded by almighty God, and had read all those threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings in the presence of the people, and of the Rulers; there arose such a feare and terrour amongst them, that they were all astonished, and as it were bestraughted of their wits, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one in anothers face, for the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:12409:72"/>
exceeding great fear which they had conceiued of those words. This was one of the principall means which almighty God v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with men in the time of the Law written, and so he did also in the time of the Law of grace: in which, the holy Apostle saith, That as there is reuealed a iustice, whereby God maketh men iust, so is there also reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led an indignation and wrath, whereby he punisheth the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iust: for which cause, S. <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> (the glorious forerunner of our Sauiour Christ) was sent with this commission and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassage, to preach vnto the world <hi>That the axe was now put to the root of the tree and that euery tree that brought no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And so great was the thunder of these words, and the terrour which entered into mens hearts, so dreadfull, that there ran vnto him of all estates and conditions of men, euen of the very Pharisees and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:12409:73"/>
Publicans, yea, and Souldiours also (which of all others are wont to be most dissolute, and to haue the least care of their consciences) and each of them demanded for himselfe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly of that holy man, what he should doe to attaine vnto sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, and to escape those ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible threatnings which he had denounced vnto them, so great was the feare they had concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of them.</p>
                        <p>And this is that (deare Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian brother) which I doe at this present (in the behalfe of Almighty God) deliuer vnto thee, although not with such feruency of spirit and like holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of life, yet that which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth more in this case, with

the same truth and certainty; for so much as the faith and Gospell which Saint <hi>Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist</hi> then preached, is euen the same now taught.</p>
                        <p>Now, if thou be desirous to vnderstand in few words, how great the punishment is, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God hath threatned in his holy Scriptures to the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that which may most briefly and most to the purpose be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in this matter, is this: That like as the reward of the good is anvniuersall good thing, euen so the punishment of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is an vniuersall euill, which comprehendeth in it al the euils that are. For the better vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing whereof, it is to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, That all the euils of this life
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:12409:74"/>
are particular euils, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doe not torment all our sences generally, but onely one, or some of them.

And so diuers men are diseased in diuers parts of the body, howbeit, in such wise, that none of all these diseases be generally through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the members of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, but particular to some one of them. And yet for all this, we see what griefe onely one of these diseases may put vs vnto, and how painefull a night the ficke man hath in any one of

these infirmities, yea, although it be nothing else but a little ach in one tooth. Now let vs put the case, that there were some one man sicke of such an vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall disease, that he had no part of his body, neither any one joynt or sence free from his proper paine, but that at one time and instant hee suffered most exceeding sharpe torment in his head, in his eyes, and eares, in his teeth, and stomack, in his liuer and heart: and to be short, in all the rest of his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and joints of his body, and that he lay after this sort stret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching himselfe in his bed, being pained with these greefes and torments, euery member of his body hauing his particular tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

vnto them, for nothing is perfectly great, in case it haue an end: But alas, they haue not so much as this poore and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable comfort: but contrariwise, their paines are equall in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance with the eternity of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, and the l<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>sting of their misery with the eternity of Gods glory. As long as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God shall liue, so long shall they dye: and when al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God shall cease to be God, then shall they also cease to be as they are. O deadly life, O immortall death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I know not whether I may truely tearme thee, either life or death: for if thou be life, why dost thou kil? And if thou be death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> why doest thou endure? Wherefore
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:12409:81"/>
I will call thee neither the one, nor the other, for so much as in both of them there is contained something that is good: as in life there is rest, and in death there is an end (which is a great comfort to the afflicted) but thou hast neither rest nor end. What art thou then? Marry, thou art the worst of life, and the worst of death; for of death thou hast the torment, without any end, and of life thou hast the continuance without any rest. O bitter composition, O vnsauory purgation of our Lords cup! of the which, all the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the earth shall drinke their part.</p>
                        <p>Now in this continuance in this eternity, I would wish that

If this then be accounted so great a torment, what torment shall that be (thinke you) in that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting night in hell, which hath no morning, nor so much as any hope of any dawning of the day: O darknesse most ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure!

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:12409:83"/>
to liue euerlastingly in such a night as this is, lying not in a soft bed (as the sicke man doth) but in a hot burning furnace, fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming out such terrible raging flames. What shoulders shall be able to abide those horrible heats. If it seeme to vs as a thing intollerable to haue onely some part of our feet standing vpon a pan of burning coales, for the space of repeating the Lords prayer, What shall it be (thinke you) to stand body and soule burning in the midst of those e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting hot raging fires in hell, in comparison of which, the fires of this world are but painted fires. Is there any wit or iudgement in this world? Haue men their right sences?
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:12409:83"/>
doe they vnderstand what these words import? or are they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture perswaded, that these are onely the fables of Poets? or doe they thinke, that this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaineth not to them, or else that it was onely ment for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? None of all this can they say, for so much as our faith assureth vs most certainly herein. And our Sauiour Christ himselfe, who is euerlasting truth, crieth out in his Gospell, saying, <hi>Heauen and earth shall faile, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Of this misery there follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth another as great as it, which is, that the paines are alwayes continuing in one like degree, without any manner of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, or decreasing. All man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

of things that are vnder the cope of heauen, doe moue and turn round about with the same heauen, and doe neuer stand still at one state or being, but are continually either ascending or descending. The sea and the riuers haue their ebbing and flowing, the times, the ages, and the mutable fortune of men, and of kingdomes, are euermore in continuall motion. There is no feauer so feruent, that doth not decline, neither griefe so sharp, but that after it is much aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, it doth forthwith de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease. To be sho't, all the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations and miseries are by little and little worne away with time, and as the common saying is, <hi>Nothing is sooner dried</hi>
                           <pb n="145" facs="tcp:12409:84"/>
                           <hi>vp than teares.</hi> Onely that paine in hell is alwayes greene, onely that feauer neuer decreaseth, onely that extremity of hear knoweth not what is either eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or morning. In the time of <hi>Noahs</hi> flood, almighty God rained forty dayes and forty nights, continually without ceasing vpon the earth, and this sufficed to drowne the whole world. But in that place of torment in hell, there shall raine euerlasting vengeance, and darts of furie vpon that cursed land, without euer ceasing so much as one onely minute or moment. Now what torment can be greater and more to be abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, than continually to suffer after one like manner, without
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:12409:85"/>
any kinde of alteration or change? Though a meat be neuer so delicate, yet in case we feed continually thereupon, it will in very short time be very loathsome vnto vs: for no meat can be more precious and deli cate than that Manna was, which almighty God sent down vnto the children of Israel in the Desart, and yet because they did eat continually thereof, it made them to loath it, yea, and prouoked them to vomit it vp againe. The way that is all plaine (they say) wea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:12409:85"/>
be alwayes after one manner, are an occasion of loathsome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and paine: what kinde of loathsomenesse will that be which shall be caused by those most horrible paines and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in hell, which doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue euerlastingly after one like sort? What will the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and cursed creatures think, when they shall there see them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues so vtterly abhorred and forsaken of almighty God, that he will not so much as with the remission of any one sinne, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigate somwhat their torments. And so great shall the fury and rage be which they shall there conceiue against him, that they shall neuer cease continually to curse and blaspheme his holy
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:12409:86"/>
name. Vnto all these paines, there is also added the paine of that euerlasting consumer, to wit, <hi>the worme of conscience,</hi> whereof the holy Scripture maketh so oftentimes mention, saying, <hi>Their worme shall neuer dye, and their fire shall neuer be quenched.</hi> This worme is a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious raging despight and bitter repentance, without any fruit, which the wicked shall alwayes haue in hell, by calling to their remembrance the opportunity and time they had whiles they were in this world, to escape those most grieuous and horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble torments, and how they would not vse the benefit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And therefore when the miserable sinner seeth himselfe
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:12409:86"/>
thus to be tormented and vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on euery side, and doth call to minde how many dayes and yeeres he hath spent idly in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, pastimes, and pleasures; and how oftentimes he was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertised of this perill, and how little regard he tooke thereof: What shall he thinke? What anguish and sorrow shall there be in his heart? Hast thou not read in the Gospell, that there shall be <hi>weeping and wailing, and gnashing of teeth?</hi> The famine of Aegypt endurd onely seuen yeares, but that in hell shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure euerlastingly. In Aegypt they found a remedy, though with great difficulty &amp; charge; but for this, there shall neuer a ny remedy be found. Theirs

Oh, if thou knewest and wouldest consider, how euery one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to hell, shall there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine tormenting and renting himselfe, weeping and wailing, and saying; O miserable and vnfortunate wretch that I am, what times and opportunities haue I suffered to passe invaine? A time there was, when with one cup of cold water I might haue purchased to my selfe a crowne of glory, and when also with such necessary workes of
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:12409:87"/>
mercy in relieuing the poore, I might haue gained life euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting. Wherefore did I not looke before me? How was I blinded with things present? How did I let passe the fruitfull yeares of abundance, and did not enrich my selfe? If I had beene brought vp amongst In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels and Pagans, and had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued that there had beene no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but onely to be born, and to dye, then might I haue had some kinde of excuse, and might haue said, I knew not what was commanded or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited me: but for so much as I haue liued amongst Christians, and was my selfe one of them professed, and held it for an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of my beleefe, that the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:12409:88"/>
houre should come when I should giue vp an account after what order I had spent my life: forsomuch also as it was daily cried out vnto me by the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall preaching and teaching of Gods Embassadours (whose aduertisements many follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, made preparation in time, and laboured earnestly for the prouision of good workes:) forasmuch I say as I made light of all these examples, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded my selfe very fondly, that heauen was prepared for me, though I tooke no paines for it at all: what deserue I that haue thus led my life? O ye in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernall furies, come and rent me in peeces, and deuoure these my bowels, for so haue I iustly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:12409:88"/>
I haue deserued eternall famishment, seeing I would not prouide for my selfe while I had time. I deserue not to reap, because I haue not sowne; I am worthy to be destitute, because I haue not laid vp in store; I deserue that my request should now be denied me, sith when the poore made request vnto me, I refused to releeue them: I haue deserued to sigh and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment so long as God shall be God; I haue deserued, that this worme of conscience shal gnaw mine entrails for euer and euer, by representing vnto mee the little pleasure that I haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed, and the great felicitie which I haue lost, and how far greater that was which I might
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:12409:89"/>
haue gained, by forgoing that little which I would not forgoe. This is that immortall worme that shall neuer dye, but shal lye there euerlastingly gnawing at the entrailes of the wicked, which is one of the most terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble paines that can possibly be imagined.</p>
                        <p>Peraduenture thou art now perswaded (good Reader) that there can be added no more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this, than hath beene said. But surely the mighty arme of God wanteth not force to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice his enemies more &amp; more: for all these paines that are hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto rehearsed, are such as doe appertaine generally to all the damned: but besides these ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall paines, there are also
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:12409:89"/>
other particular paines, which each one of the damned shall there suffer in diuers sorts, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the quality of his sinne. And so according to this proportion, the hauty and proud shall there be abased and brought low to their great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion. The couetous shall be driuen to great necessity: the glutton shall rage with conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall hunger and thirst. The lecherous shall burne in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry same flames which they themselues haue enkindled. And those that haue al their life time hunted after their pleasures and pastimes, shall liue there in continuall lamentation and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. But because examples are of very great force to moue our
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:12409:90"/>
hearts, I will bring onely one for this purpose, wherby some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of this matter may the better be perceiued. It is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of a certaine holy man, that he saw the paines (in spirit) of a licentious and worldly man in this sort. First he saw how the diuels that were present at the houre of his death, when hee yeelded vp his ghost, snatched away his soule with great reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, and made a present there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to the prince of darkenesse, who was then sitting in a chaire of fire, expecting the comming of this present. Immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that it was presented before him, he arose vp out of his seat, and said vnto the damned soule, that he would giue him the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:12409:90"/>
of that honourable seat, because he had beene a man of honour, ann was alwayes ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much affected to the same. Incontinently after that he was placed therein, crying and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting in that honourable tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there appeared before him two other most ougly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels, and offered him a cup full of most bitter and stinking liquor, and made him to drinke and carouse it vp all, perforce; saying, It is meet, sithence thou hast beene a louer of precious wines and bankets, that thou shouldest likewise proue of this our wine, whereof all we doe vse to drinke in these parts.</p>
                        <p>Immediately after this there came other two, with two fiery
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:12409:91"/>
trumpets, and setting them at his eares, began to blow into them flames of fire, saying, This melody haue we reserued for thee, vnderstanding that in the world thou wast very much delighted with minstrelcie and wanton songs: and sodainly he espied other diuels, loaden with vipers and serpents, the which they threw vpon the breast and bellies of that miserable sinner, saying vnto him, that forsomuch as he had beene greatly delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the wanton embracings and lecherous lusts of women, he should now sollace himselfe with these refreshings, instead of those licentious delights and pleasures, which he had enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the world. After this sort
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:12409:91"/>
(as the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> saith in the 47. chapter) when the sinner is punished, there is giuen measure for measure, to the end, that in such a great variety and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of punishments, the order and wisedome of Gods iustice, might the more manifestly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare.</p>
                        <p>This vision hath almighty God shewed in spirit to this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man for aduertisement and instruction, not that in hel these things are altogether so mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially done, but that by them we might vnderstand in some man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the varietie and multitude of the paines which be there appointed for the damned. Whereof, I know not how some of the Pagans haue had a
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:12409:92"/>
certaine knowledge: for a <hi>Poet</hi> speaking of this multitude of paines, affirmed, That although he had a hundred mouthes, and as many tongues, with a voyce as strong as yron, yet were they not able onely to expresse the names of them. A Poet he was that spake this, but truely therin he spake more like a Prophet or an Euangelist than a Poet. Now then, if all this euill shall most assuredly come to passe, what man is he, that seeing all this so certainly with the eyes of his faith, will not turne ouer the leafe, and begin to prouide for himselfe against that time? Where is the iudgement of m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="161" facs="tcp:12409:92"/>
selfe-loue, which seeketh euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more for his owne profit, and is much affraid of any losse? May it be thought that men are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come beasts, that prouide onely for the time present? Or haue they peraduenture so dimmed their eye-sight, that they cannot looke before them? Hearken (saith <hi>Esay</hi>) O yee deafe and ye blinde, open your eyes that you may see; Who is blinde but my seruant? And who is deafe but yee, vnto whom I haue sent my messengers? And who is blind, but he that suffereth himselfe to be sold for a slaue? Thou that seest so many things, wilt thou not suffer thy selfe to see this? Thou that hast thine ears open, wilt thou not giue eare hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to?
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:12409:93"/>
If thou beleeue not this, how art thou then a Christian? If thou beleeue it, and doest not prouide for it, how canst thou be thought a reasonable man? <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith, That this is the difference betweene opinion and imagination, that an imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation alone is not sufficient to cause a feare, but an opinion is: for if I doe imagine that a house may fall vpon mee, it is not enough to make me afraid, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse I beleeue or haue an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion it will be so indeede: for then it is sufficient to make me afraid. And hereof commeth the feare that murderers al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes haue, by reason of the suspition they conceiue, that their enemies doe lye in wait
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:12409:93"/>
for them. If then the opinion and onely suspition of danger is able to cause the greatest cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to feare, how is it that the certainty and beleefe of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and so great terrible miseries (which are farre more sure than any opinion) doth not make thee to feare. If thou perceiuest, that for these many yeares past thou hast led a licentious and sinfull life, and that at the last, according to present iustice, thou art condemned to these horrible torments in hell: if al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so there appeare by probable coniecture, that there is no more likelihood of thy amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for ensuing years to come, than there was in those already past, how happeneth it, that run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:12409:94"/>
headlong into so manifest a danger, thou art not at all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid? Especially, considering the sinfull state wherein thou liuest, and the horrible paines and torments which doe attend for thee, and the time which thou hast lost, and the endlesse repentance which thou shalt haue therefore in the most hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible torments of hell. Assured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it goes beyond the compasse of all common sence &amp; conceit of humane reason, to consider, That there should be such neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, wilfull, grosse, &amp; carelesse blindnesse, able to enter and take such deepe rooting in the soule of man.</p>

which it had in this life. This faith telleth thee also, that both the reward of vertue, and the punishment of vice, is a thing so wonderfull, that although the whole world were full of bookes, and all creatures were writers, yet should they all be wearied, and the world come to an end, before they should end their description, and make a perfect declaration what is comprehended in each one of these points. This faith infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth thee also, that the debts and duties which we owe to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, are so great, that albeit a man had so many liues as there be sands in the Sea, yet would they not suffice, if they were al employed in his seruice.

If that bonds of debts and benefits; what debts are greater than these which we owe vnto al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, as well for that he is which he is, as also for that which we haue receiued of him? If the feare of perils doe moue vs, what greater perill can there be than death, the houre there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of being so vncertaine, and the account so strait? If thou be moued with peace, liberty, qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etnesse of minde, and with a pleasant life, (which are things that all the world desires) it is certaine, that all these are found much better in the life that is gouerned by vertue and reason, than in that life which is ruled by the affections and passions of
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:12409:97"/>
the minde, forsomuch as man is a reasonable creature, and no beast. Howbeit, in case thou account all this as not sufficient to moue thee thereunto, yet let it sussice thee to consider fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that euen almighty God so abased himselfe for thy sake, that he descended from heauen vnto the earth, and became man, and whereas hee created the whole world in sixe dayes, he bestowed three and thirty yeares about thy redemption; yea, and was also contented for the same to loose his life. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God dyed, that sinne should dye; and yet for all this doe we endeauour, that sinne might liue in our hearts, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding that our Lord
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:12409:97"/>
purposed to take away the life of sinne with his owne death. If this matter were to be discus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with reason, surely this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready spoken might suffice to preuaile with any reasonable creature: for not onely in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding almighty God vpon the crosse, but whethersoeuer we doe turne our eyes, we shall finde, that euery thing crieth out to vs, and calleth vpon vs to receiue this so excellent a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit: for there is not a thing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the world (if wee duely consider it) but doth inuite vs to the loue and seruice of our Sauiour Iesus Christ, insomuch, that looke how many creatures there be in the world, so many preachers there are, so many

bookes, so many voices, and so many reasons, which doe all call vs vnto almighty God.</p>
                     <p>And how is it possible then, that so many callings as these are, so many promises, so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny threatnings, and so many prouocations, should not suffice to bring vs vnto him? What might almighty God haue done more than he hath done, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised more greater blessings than hee hath promised, or threatned more grieuous and horrible torments than he hath threatned to draw vs vnto him, and to plucke vs away from sinne? And yet all this not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, how commeth it to passe, that there is so great (I will not say arrogancy, but)
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:12409:98"/>
bewitching of men, that doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue these things to be certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true, and yet be not afraid to continue all the dayes of their life in the committing of deadly sinnes? yea, to goe to bed in deadly sinne, and to rise vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in deadly sinne, and to embrue themselues in euery kinde of loathsome, detestable, and odious sin, euen as though all their whole endeauours in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the practise of sinne, to resist all grace and fauour in the sight of God?
