         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

this controverſie by the accidents ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
in the Epiſtle to the Reader: I
levelled all my labours, to rake vp the
coales, and ſtiflle the flames of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.
Being priuate, I endevoured
to keepe my ſelfe within the boundes of my condition. I
wrote in ſecrete, acquainting fewe with my counſell. I
tempered my ſtile with the modeſteſt words that I could
deviſe I ſubmitted my ſelf to be led by better reaſons. I
abſtained from offences, &amp; occaſions of choller. I wrote
in latine, that it might not come into the handes of the
<pb facs="tcp:178019:4"/>
multitude: hoping that if anie blowes fell harder, then
I meant them, they might be the better taken, the fewer
ſaw them. But all this ſeed bred no corne: for M. Doct.
hunting after praeferment (if I miſtake not his plot) and
ſetting the foundation of his praiſe on this conqueſt,
hath now publiſhed in print, that I wrote in a corner, &amp;
cried at the croſſe, that I ſent vnder ſeale. If the worſte
were my diſgrace, it might be borne with: or if all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
had learning, this reply might be contemned. But
ſeeing this cauſe is Chriſts, and ſlips amongeſt the ſimple
may goe for ſix pence: I will not betray him, that hath
done ſo much for mee, nor ſee them deceaued, whome he
hath bought ſo dearlie. The queſtion is of an article of
our faith, and pertaineth to all, that care what they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue.
The doubt is not, whether the article be true, but
in what ſenſe it is true. For, ſeing theſe articles are not
ſcripture, but grounded on the Scripture: the queſtion
is, in what ſenſe Chriſt is ſaid according to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
to deſcend into Hell. And now ſeeing hee is no
more a Chriſtian, that is ignorant of his faith, then he
a Carpenter, that ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not handle his axe: this muſt needs
be a queſtion as neceſſarie, as it is needfull for a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
to vnderſtand, what he beleeueth. For that, which
manie ſaie, it ſufficeth to knowe that Chriſt deſcended
into Hell, though they knowe not, in what ſort he was
there; is as if a farmer ſhoulde content himſelf, that hee
hath a leaſe of his fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>me, and neuer enquire how long it
laſteth, nor on what condition hee holdeth. By the
ſame reaſon, it is ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to know that Chriſt was born,
and that he ſuffered: and needleſſe to ſeeke how he was
<pb facs="tcp:178019:4"/>
borne, and what hee ſuffered. Wherefore, I haue reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
to ſtand at my defenſe, and to beare the brunt of
theſe blowes. For, my weapons are ſound Syllogiſmes,
my armour Scripture, and truth my ſhield. I doubt not
of the proofe, and feare not the muſcate. I was brief be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as the mediocritie of a private letter requyred. My
breuitie bred obſcuritie, and gaue more probabilitie to
his inverſions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and euaſions: to his inſinuations and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections,
to his making and marring my argumentes in
wrong mouldes. But now I haue made them my ſelf, &amp;
ſhaped them on ſuch blockes, as will not (I hope) be eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
wrung out of faſhion. I haue turned his ordinance
ſome againſt himſelf, and all from vs, ſo farre, as I hope
he will diſpair himſelf, to hit this marke with that ſhot.
Yet becauſe manie mindes are ſwayed with affection of
the man, or with conceit of the matter: and my name
came neuer neere ſo manie eares, as this booke is like to
come in mouths: I haue reſolued to commend it to your
honor. Hoping, that if your name win minds to read<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the
waight of my reaſons, ſhall turne the ſcales, and winne
heartes to beleeue. I haue manie reaſons of my choiſe.
Your Zeale of Gods houſe. Your loue of Gods glorie, Your
knowledge in Gods worde. And your aeſtimation, in
Gods Church, amongeſt ſuch, as loue his name ſincearly

the Fryar Bellarmine, hauing laid open all the plaites,
and ript the ſeames of this controuerſie: I preſume the
more to vſe your name in this cauſe, which hath beene

maintained vnder your countenance. If there were any
hope, that that worke would come out ſhortlie, I would
burie my papers in the duſte. But ſeeing that time is
like to be long<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and manie in the meane time are decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
with theſe bold bragges. I haue thought expedient
(to amaze the adverſaries of this doctrine with the
light of that ſunne, when it ſhall pleaſe God to giue it to
his Church) to ſet out my little candle, wherein (I hope)
there is light inough, to diſperſe the miſtes, and pearce
the cloudes of theſe Sophiſmes. Thus, beſeeching God
(the authour of all honour) to augment your honour, to

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am forced (gentle Reader) though
I hate contention, to contend with
a contentious man: or elſe, having
the better end of the ſtaffe, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake

that the Lordes fielde ſhould want

pertaines to the one ſide. It is hard, (and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt

as I am cleare before the Lord, ſo, to purge my ſelfe

beganne. The Biſhop of Salisburie that laſt was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his remooving to Yorke, tooke order, that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
preachers ſhould keepe lecture on the market
daies, in the cheefe market townes of his Dioceſe.
There is a great market euerie Satterday at a towne
called Chippenhame, in North Wilſhire. Within 4.
myles of which, dwelleth one M. Wiſedome, a man
for integritie of lyfe, and exceeding paines in his cal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ling
loued of all the godlie, hated of the wicked and
admired of both. This man was one of the prechers
appointed to that place, and preached there once in
a fourtnight, or a month, I know not which. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
on Satterday the 14. day of Februarie or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about
<hi>Anno</hi> 1589. expounding in that place the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of the beleef, he deliuered this opinion, which
I defend, concerning the deſcenſe of Chriſt into hel.
Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had done, one Chalfont Vicar of that towne
<pb facs="tcp:178019:6"/>
ſtood vp, and proteſted to the people, that hee had
taught falſe doctrine: and promiſed, that if they
would come that day ſeuen night, they ſhould heare

commes. The people flockes to the Church in
great multituds, exſpecting ſome famous man, with
ſome new matter. At length, in came this. M. Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>font
himſelf. Hee climbes into the pulpit, and pyles
vp a heap of books, as high as his head. Then after
a pſalme, and a formall prayer, hee beginnes like an
Oratour at his own perſon and his adverſaries, that
he was M. Wiſedomes ſenior, that he was a Bachelor
when M. Wiſedome was a Scholler: and a Maiſter of
Arte. before he was a Bachelour. That hee had read
more, and knew more, then he. That he had learned
arithmetick, and could reckon the articles of the
creed, better then hee. That there was 12. of them,
made by the 12. Apoſtles. That his memorie ſerued
him to remember, which Apoſtle made which arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.
That M. Wiſedome did reckon them wrong, and
made but 11. of them. That al learned Fathers were
on his conſpiracie. That M. Wiſedome did falſefie
Calvine, and other learned writers: That Chriſt

London. He lookes downe manie times on M. Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
where he ſat vnder the pulpite, amazed at his
impudencie, like a meeke ſheep, (as hee is indeede)
and calles him by his name. This ſaieth Auguſtine,
this ſaieth Ierome, this ſaieth Cyprian, and you ſay
that. Where was your learning? Where was your
<pb facs="tcp:178019:6"/>
reading? Where was your ſimplicitie and plain dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
which you make ſhow of? And turning to the
people he warned them to be ware of falſe Prophets
that going in ſheepes clothing, were inwardlie raue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
wolues, meaning M. Wiſedome becauſe of his
plainneſſe, and ſimplicitie. This exclamation, (for
ſermon I cannot call it) being ended, the people de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
ſome ſaying this, and ſome ſaying that: and
all, (ſauing ſuch as loue, or malice did carrie more
then truth or matter) condemning Chalfonts impu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dencie.
That day ſeuen-night, the people meets a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
hoping to heare M. Wiſdome reply, for that
was his day by the Biſhops order. But M. Hil beeing
then at a towne called Leycocke, within 2. myles of
this Chippenhame by accident, or of ſet purpoſe, I
know not, came thither that morning, and tooke
the place. The ſame man not manie yeares before,
had dipped in the ſame controuerſy almoſt after the
ſame manner at Sarum, againſt one M. Connam, a
man both learned, and Chaplane to my L. of Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke.
But to let that paſſe, at this ſermon 28. Feb.
<hi>Anno</hi> 1589. I was my ſelfe, vpon the occaſions ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
in the beginning of my letter to M. Hill, (for
as yet he was not Doctor) which he hath printed. In
it with painted words, and great names of Doctors
he ſo varniſhed the matter, that at the firſt hearing
it ſeemed not improbable. Towards his aduerſaries
hee behaued himſelfe modeſtlie, geuing them the
praiſe both of learning and godlineſſe, namely Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
and Beza. To blaze their error in this point, he

Then after a ſolempne challenge to all the
learned men in the world, that did diſſent from him,
he offered his notes to anie that would haue them:
he promiſed faire play, if anie man would anſwere
<pb facs="tcp:178019:7"/>
him: he proteſted loue to him, that coulde confute
him: and vowed a recantation in the ſame place, if
his forces could not bide the battle. I hearing this
braue challenge, and miſtruſting his cardes for all
his facing: wrought a freend that had acquaintance
with him, to help mee to his notes. After two mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths
or there-abouts, hee ſent them to mee vnder
his owne hand. Peruſing them, I found them out of
their coullours, nothing anſwerable to the ſhewe
that they made in the pulpite. Wherefore, hearing
of no man, that did reply: ſaving M. Wiſdome in a
ſermon that M. Hill was not at: and hoping that his
proteſtations had beene as farre in his heart, as they
were faire in his mouth: I reſolued to anſwere him
for the truthes ſake, though my leaſure was not
much, promiſing my ſelf as much thank for my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
as his great offers led mee to beleeue. To keep
it ſecrete, I wrote in latine. I ſeaſoned my wordes,
with all moderation, that might bee in a contrarie
ſtyle. I offered to confeſſe, if it could be ſhewed, that
my anſweres turned not the edge of his argumentes.
To be ſhort, I promiſed to yeelde to anie truth, that
he could proue. I was in hope that this conference
ſhould haue beene priuate, amongeſt vs, and ſuch
freends onelie, as hee or I, might haue acquainted
with it. Indeed, he offered mee to haue talked of the
matter at a freends houſe. But I conſidering, that in
ſuch diſputations, ſtormes of wordes ryſing out of
hearts, heated with contradiction, doth hinder rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and ſtop judgement, refuſed any conference, but
with the pen.<note place="margin">The ſecond conſideration is better than the firſt.</note> This reply I finiſhed within few daies:
But miſtruſting mine own infirmities, and knowing
that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, I kept it in my hand
till the next May following. Then going home to
viſite my naturall freendes, I left it with a freend or
two to be deliuered him. They beeing doubtfull of
<pb facs="tcp:178019:7"/>
my returne, though it not beſt to ſturre a coale, that
they knew no man in my abſence to put out. At my
returne vnderſtanding that they had not deliuered
it: I tooke it into my handes againe, I added and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
diuerſe things. I wrote it new: and ſent it him
incloſed in a letter. In time of my abſence, (which
was half a yeare and more) he had receaued by ſome
ſecret meanes, an engliſhe copie of the firſt draught,
which I my ſelfe had tranſlated at the requeſt of a
freend, not aboue fiue daies before my journey. It I
deliuered him with condition to bring it mee againe
He brought it not, and I forgot it. In time of my ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
he lent it to another, &amp; the other gaue a cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
of it to one, that put it in M. Hills hands. To that
before my returne, he had fumbled vp this anſwere,
that now he hath printed. I not knowing it, ſent him
(as I haue ſaid) the latine. Vpon receit whereof hee
ſent the other amongſt his freends. It went amongſt
them from one to another, from November (for in
Nouember I ſent mine,) till the September follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and then he ſent it mee. In this meane time ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
were giuen out, that I had anſwered his ſermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
that he had replied, and I recanted. Theſe ſpeeches
grew dailie, and lifted his heart as high as his name.
Whereon hee reſolued to diſpute in Oxenford for a
ſcarlet hood. He promiſed his freends to make that
one of his queſtions. He gaue out, that al Oxford was
on his ſide. But when it came to proof, hee was faine
to promiſe to his friends, and they to others, that he
would conferre with learned men: that hee woulde
yeeld to anie truth,<note place="margin">The admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of a man to a degree of ſchoole in Oxford is cal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led a grace.</note> that could be proued out of the
word: that he would not deall in that queſtion, but
as he ſhould be led by ſuch conference, or els he had
gone as graceles out of Oxford, as he came thither.
Notwithſtanding, when he was ſure of his grace, to
maintain his credit amongſt his friends in the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie:
<pb facs="tcp:178019:8"/>
he took that queſtion to maintaine in Oxfoord
on the Viper day of the Act. howe manfully hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
it, I report me to them that heard him. <hi>A fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius
terrae</hi> at the lower end of the ſchoole (a thing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
ſeene before in that place at that time) got a pla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cet
of the Doctor of the chyre, to bruſh his skarlet
gowne: who trimmed it ſo neatly, that if his cheeks
wold haue taken the ſtaines of ſhame, he had worne
as much skarlet in his face, as he did on his back. In
this ſtory (thou maieſt ſee good Reader) that my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary
did thruſt his hooke in an other mans har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt
at Chippinhame: that he took not my reply ſo
wel as he promiſed in the pulpit. That he made that
publick which I wrote in private. That he went far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
abroad, &amp; hunted for contention in Oxfoord.
That hee plaied at the ſame bale before, in Sarum.
That he bare the ſimple in hand, that all the learned
of the Vniverſitie were of his mind. That hee fed an
vntrue rumour, that I had recanted. That he printed
my privat letter without my conſent or knowledg.
And that to trouble the ſimple with it, he publiſhed
that in engliſh, which I wrote in latine. For my part
I hope I did nothing but that which the dutie of a
Chriſtian required. hearing the trueth impugned I
did defend it: fearing that he had bene deceiued on
ſimplicitie, I laboured to reforme him. I wrote in
faire tearmes to avoide offences. I wrote in a ſtrange
tongue to keepe it ſecret. And I hunted not for this
contention: but was drawen into it with faire pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
of great thanks: wherfore I hope if thou haue
but one dramme of indifferencie, that thou wilteſt
wipe this bleamiſh from my face. If I fall nowe into
rougher tearmes impute the fault to him, that kept
not himſelfe within the ſame bounds as I beganne.
Moreover, it is impoſsible to anſwere this booke,
wherein are ſo many errours in al kinds of learning
<pb facs="tcp:178019:8"/>
without tearms of offence. The humour alſo of this
adverſary is ſuch, and his eſtimation amongeſt the
ſimple, that if I ſpare him, I ſhall feede it, and hinder
the trueth. Add that it is impoſsible for me to paſſe
over ſuch vnmanerly diſgraces of lies, impude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t lies,
ſhameles lies in matters politicall, damnable lies in
maters theological: diſagreing with Mathew, Mark,
Luke, Iohn, Paul, Peter, Chriſt himſelf, &amp; al the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and never turne the bale comming ſo faire to
the other end of the tenniſe. In ſome places hee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
my words a meaning, that I neuer meant: In
ſome places he giues my arguments a ſhape, that I
neuer made. In ſome places hee bends his proofes
to things not denied: In many places hee ſlipps the
point in controverſie, and paſſes by arguments, as
if he neuer ſawe them. And in no place anſweres one
argument like a ſcholler, much leſſe a Doctor. If I
rippe vp theſe things in their places freely: I hope
good Reader, that thou wilteſt rather lay the fault
on him, that made them ſuch; than me, that cal them
as they are. Thus beſeeching thee to weigh the cauſe
throughly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to giue every colour his own name:

               </gap>eavours as this, may well blind the ſimple:
but amongſt the wiſe wil never purchaſe much credit to your cauſe.
But you would haue let all alone you ſay, if the ſpeeches of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
diſgracing your abilitie had not ſet you a worke: my deſire was
either to winne you to vs, or reaſons from you to drawe me to you.
But nowe it appeareth that your owne eſtimation was more preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in your eies, than the defence of the trueth, or winning men
<pb facs="tcp:178019:10"/>
from errours. This will be a foull blot in the face of a Doctor: ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
you waſh it with a bale of truth and plaine dealing, confeſſing
that I was in no errour at all. But then you ſay you reſolved to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
your ſelfe, or elſe to recant. I thought you had bene reſolute
in Chippinhames pulpit ſix moneths before, if you were not as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
then as now, I will not take your word for ſhoe-buckles: for
I had then more witneſſes to your word, than I haue now to your

Peter, Paul, and Chriſt himſelf, could haue eſcaped the
check of your pen, if it had not bene to maintaine your owne cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite
amongſt the people. It is without doubt, that you loued that
moſt, that moved you moſt. If you were not as jelous of their main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
as your owne eſtimation you were not ſo ſure a friend, as
many ſuppoſed. But it is hard for me you ſay, to kicke againſt the
prick. It were ſo if I did ſo. but looke you M. Doctor to your owne
heeles: for my part I haue the teſtimony of a good conſcience. No
other cauſe, than the ſimple loue of the trueth ſet me on worke. I le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled
not at preferment. I commended not my work to great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſones.
I publiſhed not my book till you opened the gate: &amp; I could
do no leſſe than followe. As for Chriſt and his Apoſtles I hope to
make it clear in al indifferent eares, that I haue not oppoſed one
ſyllable againſt them: And that you pull my wordes, as Cacus did
Hercules his Kein into what ſtinking dennes, it pleſeth your wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
braine to deviſe. I know both what, when, and where I write. I
write of an Article of our faith, in which I am ſo much more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt,
as the Children of God ſhuld be more diligent to vnderſtand
their faith aright. As for theſe dangerous times it is you that neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
them. It is you, that devide the coat of Chriſt: it is you that han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
the Scriptures guilefully: it is you, that publiſh private things to
make the Papiſts ſport, and trouble the Church. That which divers
learned Papiſts affirme the Scriptures, never ſaide you put them to
the rack to make them confeſſe. Scotus ſaith, that the diſcenſe of
Chriſt into hell cannot be prooued by Scriptures. And radius one

how to frame irrefragable reaſons to you. There was a Prophecie
(as Curtius recordeth) that hee who could vndoe the knottes of
Gordius his chariot, ſhould be Emperour of Aſia. Alexander inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that conqueſt, came to the temple where thoſe knottes were
kept, to ſee, if hee could open them. But they beeing inſoluble by
mans reaſon, hee tore all aſſunder with his ſword. So you ſerue my
arguments, be they never ſo irrefragable: when you cannot open
them with reaſon: you teare them all aſſunder with violence. As for
my latine anſwere, which I indeed did ſend you, and you in trueth
ſhould haue anſwered me, and not this wandring vagabound: you
haue had it theſe three yeares and more, wherein were ſucceſſiue
houres ynough to anſwere two ſheets of Paper: if you haue not bin
more buſie about greater matters, than you would haue the world
to knowe. In the meane time I haue pervſed this, and put my friends
in hope of good ſucceſſe in the other: when your long leaſure will
ſerue you to anſwere it. Thus beſeeching God to giue vs all one
heart and one minde, I end.</p>

            <head>THE STATE OF THIS QVESTION
brieflie ſet down, for the capacitie of ſuch as are
not able to carie the drift of all this
diſcourſe before them.</head>
            <p>THe hebrevve vvord <hi>SHEOL,</hi> vvhich the Greekes call <hi>hades,</hi> the
latines <hi>infernus,</hi> and vvee hell, hath three ſignifications in the
ſcriptures.</p>
            <p>Firſt and properlie it ſignifieth the graue, or common condition of all
the dead, expreſſed in the greek <hi>hades</hi> by the priuation of light or lyfe.</p>
            <p>Secondlie, the place of tormentes, appointed for the puniſhment of the
vvicked: for this the hebrevve vvord is leaſt, and our ingliſh vvorde moſt
vſuall, or rather as it is commonlie taken, hardlie ſignifieth any thing els.</p>
            <p>Thirdlie, the torments of hel, vvhich by a Metonymicall hyperbole for
amplifications ſake, is manie times attributed to the ſorrovves of this life.
Theſe things are knovvn to al the learned. And this D. confeſſeth them
ſect. 4. See alſo ſect. 8. ſect. 9. and ſect. 14.</p>
            <p>Novve, vvhere our beleefe hath that Chriſt deſcended into hell: the
queſtion is vvhich of theſe three ſignifications doth beſt fit that article of
our faith: We ſay, that ſeing euery article of our faith muſt haue an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>douted
ſenſe confirmed by the Scriptures, it muſt needs ſignifie the helliſh
torments that he ſuffered for our redemption, or the darkneſſe of death,
vvhich ſvvallovved him the three daies that he vvas in the graue. That
theſe thingt are true, and may be the true ſenſe of that article, our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
cannot denie. Yet not contented heerevvith, they vvil ſinke deeper,
and ſend Chriſts ſoule to the damned pit of hell, neither to ſuffer himſelf,

               </gap> that ſuffered there. Novve, becauſe this is a thing that
no man can avouch vpon his ovvne knovvledge, but God himſelf: We re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
to take their vvords vvithout his vvarrant. Wherefore to mend this

out of the 4. to the <hi>Epheſ.</hi> But theſe proofes being doubtfull, that is,
implying other plainer ſenſes We denie them to be ſufficient to make this
doubtfull aſſertion, an vndoubted article of our faith. Our reaſon is, no
doubtfull proofes can make a doubtfull aſſertion an vndoubted article of
our faith: But theſe proofes be doubtfull. <hi>Ergo,</hi> theſe proofes cannot make
this doubtfull aſſertion, an vndoubted article of our faith. That theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fes

<pb facs="tcp:178019:12"/>
both plainer, and better fitting the places, and agreeable to the reſt of
the Scriptures, vvill driue anie reaſonable head to confeſſe. Neither doeth
diverſe learned Papiſts denie it. But this aduerſarie more impudent then
they, blusheth not like a vvyer dravver, to pull theſe Scriptures through
narrovve holes, to make them ſmal inough, to tie our faith to his fantaſie.
Moreouer, vvith like violence, hee is forced to break dovvn tvvo other
vvalls that ſtands in his vvay. The one is in the 23 of <hi>Luke,</hi> ver. 46. <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

of the ſame cap. ſpoken to the theef, <hi>This day ſhalt thou be with mee in
Paradice.</hi> By vvhich tvvo places it is cleare, that Chriſts ſoule vvas then
in heauen, and not in Hell. Vpon the true ſenſe of theſe places riſeth this
diſputation, to vvhich I referre the diſcreet and indifferent Reader, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching
them to read vvith a ſingle eie, and iudge vvith an vpright hart.
Onelie I vvill lance an impoſtume of abſurdities, vvhich breeding in the
bovvels of this opinion, like the vvorme that breeds in the nut, hath putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
all the probabilitie of it, and made all men of indifferent iudgement
in this age to caſte it vnder the boord amongeſt the shreddes.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that Chriſt went down to Hell to triumph, contrarie to the
nature of Hell, which yeeldeth nothing but horrour and torments.
And contrarie to the nature of a triumph, which was vſuallie ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized
amongſt them, to whom the joy of the victorie did appertaine</p>
            <p>Secondlie, that Chriſts ſoule did preach in Hell, contrarie to the
nature of a ſoule, that cannot preache: and the condition of thoſe
hearers, who could reap no profite of his ſermon having their juge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
alreadie.</p>
            <p>Thirdlie, that he did preach neither to convert the hearers, nor
to condempne them for the contempt of his word: but to aggrauate
their ſorrowes. Contrarie to the office of Chriſt, which was to offer
mercie to all his hearers.</p>
            <p>Fourthlie, that Chriſts ſoul did preach in Hel reallie, not vocal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie:
that is, did preach in Hel and ſay nothing: contrary to the nature
of the word preach, which neuer man did, without voice &amp; words.</p>
            <p>Fiftlie, that Chriſt meaning to go to Hell, (as they ſay) did not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
commend his ſoule into the hands of God. Contrarie
to the true and common vſe of theſe words vſed by Stephan, Act. 7.
and all other godlie men, that craue to be i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Sixtlie, that his ſoule was in Hell with<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>t torments, contrarie to
the name and nature of Hell, which preſenteth to the care and hart,
nothing but hainous and hideous torments.</p>
            <p>Seventhlie, that in theſe words (Thou ſhalt be with mee in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice)
Chriſt ſpake onelie of his God-head. Contrarie to the nature
of the pronoune (<hi>me</hi>) which doeth alwaies note the whole perſon
that ſpeaketh.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:178019:13"/>
Eightlie, that having conquered Hell vpon the croſſe: It was
needfull for him notwithſtanding to goe to hell. Contrarie to the
ſufficiencie of Chriſts ſacrifice, who had paid a full ranſome for our
ſinnes before, and left nothing behinde to be done in Hell. Theſe 8.
cankers are feſtered in the marrowe of this abſurde opinion, for all
which, all the Scriptures hath not one ſillable, and therefore it muſt
be a monſter, that hath bred ſo manie monſters.</p>
            <p>I Had anſwered Maiſter Doctors Sermon (as he calls it) but to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
prolixitie, and becauſe this is but a repetition of his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
there, I haue left it out, and haue ſent him a breefe ſumme
thereof, to ſhewe him that there is nothing there, better then here:
only in the end of it, he calles al his adverſaries Boyes, ſchiſmaticks,

if <hi>Hoper</hi> biſhop of Gloceſter be a boy, if <hi>Reynald Peacock,</hi> Biſhop of

that you had certified <hi>M. Chalfont</hi>

to defende that which hee had ſpoken againſt <hi>M.
Wiſedome,</hi> that day ſennight before, concerning the
deſcenſion of Chriſt into hell: where fore my friend
wrought me to ſtay, to heare what could be ſayd for
a matter, that both hee and I did thinke to haue no

               <p>IN the entrance of your anſwer, you haue told two
vntruths vpon vntrue reports. The on, that I cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
<hi>M. Chalfont</hi> of mine intent, which is not ſo:
for neither by meſſenger nor letter, did I euer ſend to
<hi>M. Chalfont.</hi> The other is, where you auouch that
I would make an apology of. <hi>M. Chalfonlts</hi> ſayings
againſt <hi>M. Wiſdome,</hi> which God knoweth was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
my meaning: for firſt, I neuer knew what he had
fayd in that controuerſy, til the morning I preached.
Secondly, I did alwaies loue and honour <hi>M. Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi>
but <hi>M. Chalfont,</hi> til that morning I was not
acquainted with al. Thirdly, hearing a ſtrife reuiued
of that matter, which was not long before quieted in

and being requeſted to deliuer my iudgment in the
matter, not by <hi>M. Chalfont,</hi> but by one <hi>Richarde

not to warre againſt <hi>M. Wiſedome:</hi> In the feare of
God, and not to pleaſe you or your friend, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
man, I layd downe my iudgement, and gaue vp
my Sermon in writing to <hi>M. Wiſedome,</hi> crauing an
anſwere to the whole, &amp; not to ſome part of it. Now,
you haue made an anſwer to ſome, how truly it ſhall
appeare: and other things you haue left vnanſwered,
for what cauſe, let the reader iudge. In the end, you
charge me with wit, which is ſmall, with eloquence,
which is none, and with my promiſe, which I will

THeſe hainous accuſations of vntruthes might
haue beene left; ſaving that you would haue the
worlde to thinke that I am a common lyar. To this
end you crie out almoſt in euerie ſect. impudent and
monſtrous lyes. It is in deed, a point of Rhethorike,
but you neuer learned it in Chriſts ſchoole, to build
the credite of your cauſe (if it be euill) on the diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite
of your aduerſarie. But they which are acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

and they that know mee not, neede no better argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of my innocencie, then your accuſations, and
the ſmall occaſions, that you take againſt mee. For,
if the report that came to my friend, was not true; I
hope it was no great fault of mine: nor greater fault
in you, to haue certified <hi>M. Chalfont</hi> of your purpoſe,
then to haue performed it. If I woulde ſit downe to
<hi>audite,</hi> and take counters in hand to lay your ſlippes,
but halfe ſo diligentlie; as you are buſie vpon euery
corner of occaſions, to pul my wordes into ſuſpition
of vntruthes: I coulde note in this praeface foure
ſcapes, not miſtaken vpon vntrue reportes (as you
charge mee) but miſreported by your ſelf, that wold
ſcarſe abide a juſt tryall of honeſt dealing. Firſt, that
hearing ouer night of that controverſie ſo much in
mens mouthes; you knewe not <hi>M. Chalfonts</hi> part till
the morning, you preached there; may be true, but is
not verie likelie. Secondlie, that you ment not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
<hi>M. Chalfonts</hi> opinion, will hardlie be beleeued,
except you can perſwade the audie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that you ment
one thing, and did an other. Thirdlie, that you gaue
vp your ſermon to <hi>M. Wiſedome</hi> in wriring. <hi>M. Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi>
can tel that it is not true. Hee had nothing of
you, but a few ſcribled &amp; diſordered notes. The laſt is
cunninger, that I anſwered not the whole, but ſome
part of your ſermon. That which eſcaped without

if you had not bene more buſie, then your commiſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
it might haue ſtand more with your credite, to

Heere you fumble about an excuſe, and would faine

to Hell to delyuer the Fathers: the other, to deliuer
whome he himſelf thought good. Will your rotten

the Fathers,<note place="margin">Epiſt. ad A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſiam queſt. 1. tom. 3. Epiſt. It is a wicked thing to ſay, that Chriſt deſcended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hell, or place of the damned.</note> and you ſend him to the hell of the
damned, where the Fathers neuer were. They are ſo
farre from you, that <hi>Ierome</hi> ſaieth, it is <hi>impium dicere

You ſpend the moſte of this ſection, to proue mee a

that which you ſay. I onlie ſaide, that neither
<hi>Auguſtine</hi> nor <hi>Ierome,</hi> did ſend Chriſt to hell to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph.
Secondly, if I had ſaid ſo, I had ſaid trulie. For
you ſend Chriſt to the hell of the damned, and that,
none of them euer deemed. Therfore in this behalf,
(to vſe your owne words) you haue tolde a manifeſt
vntruth of mee. You father that on mee, which I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

Ghoſt, and Peter: two ſufficient witneſſes: becauſe
they referre this place to the reſurrection, and we to
the paſsion. Allace (good Doctor) <hi>vbiacumen tuum?</hi>
Doe not you ſee man that though the negatiue, <hi>Thou
wilt not leaue my ſoule in hell,</hi> pertaineth to the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection?
yet the affirmatiue, that his ſoule was in

negatiue in the Pſal. to proue his reſurrection: and
our queſtion is not whether hee roſe againe, or not?
but whether the thing wherein he was, is to bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for the place, or the panges of hell. And heere I
muſte needes confeſſe, that this conſideration hath
driuen mee quite from <hi>Calvine,</hi> whome in this place
I firſt followed. As for the place of the beleefe, I am
perſwaded, that his ſenſe is moſte agreable: beeing
godlie, conſonant to the Scriptures, neceſſarie for
the perfection of the creede, not repugnant to the
circumſtances thereof, and moſte comfortable to a
Chriſtian conſcience. But in this place of this Pſal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
now I ſee that <hi>Olevians</hi> opinion is truer, more conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:178019:23"/>
that SHEOL is heer ſet for the ſtate of the dead,
and my ſoule for mee, as it is Pſal. 3. 2. <hi>Manie ſay to
my ſoule,</hi> that is, to mee. And Pſal. 7. 2. <hi>Leaſt hee
devoure my ſonle lyke a Lyon,</hi> that is mee. And Pſal.
6. 3. <hi>My ſoule is ſore troubled,</hi> that is, I am ſore
troubled. So the ſenſe muſt bee, <hi>Thou wilt not leaue
my ſoule in Hell:</hi> that is, mee amongeſt the deade.
That this muſt needes bee the true ſenſe heereof,
I haue two reaſons. Firſt, that this was the SHEOL
wherein Chriſtes ſoule was not left, whence hee
roſe againe, as may appeare by this allegation of
<hi>Peter.</hi> But hee roſe again from the graue and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the deade, not from hell, and condition
of the damned. <hi>Ergo</hi> the SHEOL wherein Chriſts
ſoule was not left, is the condition of the dead, and
not the place of the damned. The anſwere here, that
he roſe in ſoule, and body: the one from hell, and the
other from the graue, will not holde: for the name
of reſurrection, belongeth onelie to the bodie: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
nothing ryſeth againe, but that which death
laide downe. So hath our beleefe the reſurrection
of the bodie, not the reſurrection of the ſoule.
This was <hi>M. Fieldes</hi> argument, which did choake
you in the act at <hi>Oxonford:</hi> and hang ſo faſt in your
teeth, that hee coulde not get it out of your mouth,
much leſſe an anſwere to it. The other, is builded v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the wordes of Peter. Act. 2. 19. <hi>Men and brethren,
I may boldlie speake to you of the patriarch</hi> Dauid, <hi>that hee
is dead and buried, and his ſepulchre is amongeſt vs to this
day.</hi> In which wordes, expounding this place of the
Pſalme: <hi>Thou wilt not leaue my ſoule in hell, nor ſuffer thy
holie one to ſee corruption:</hi> hee laboureth to proue that
<hi>Dauid</hi> ſpake not this of himſelfe, but of the <hi>Meſſias</hi>
that was to come of his loines. His reaſon is, becauſe
Dauid is deade and buried, and his ſepulchre remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
amongeſt them: as if he had ſaid, becauſe <hi>Dauids</hi>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:178019:23"/>
ſoule was left in Hell, and ſaw corruption. For where
the negatiue is not true, there the affirmatiue muſte
bee true, by the rule of contradiction. Wherevpon
thus I reaſon. <hi>Dauids</hi> ſoule (that is Dauid himſelf as I
haue ſaid before) was left in the SHEOL wherin Chriſts
ſoule ſhould not be left. But Dauids ſoule was left in
the ſtate and condition of death: <hi>Ergo,</hi> it was the ſtate
and condition of death, wherein Chriſtes ſoule was
not left, by this place. The ſame argument may bee
formed negatiuelie: to take away your expoſition of
this place. <hi>Dauids</hi> ſoule was left in the SHEOL wherof
it is ſaid in the Pſalme, <hi>Thou wilt not leaue my ſoule in
Hell, nor ſuffer thy holie one to ſee corruption.</hi> But Dauids
ſoule was not left in the place of the damned: <hi>Ergo,</hi>
it is not the place of the damned, whereof it is ſaid in
the Pſalme, <hi>Thou wilt not leaue my ſoule in hell, nor ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
thy holie one to ſee corruption.</hi> Wheras ſome alledge
againſt this interpretation, that it doeth violate the
text: taking the ſoule firſt for the whole man, &amp; the
whole againe for the bodie. Let them conſider, that
the condition of the dead, expreſſed heere in the
name of SHEOL, pertaineth not to the body only, but
to the whole man. Neither were it injurie to the
text, if it be ſo taken. For the cup is ſet for wine, and
wine for the blood of Chriſt by Paull himſelf, who v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
not to violate wordes. Theſe reaſons therefore
haue led mee from <hi>Calvine,</hi> whome though I reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
(as he is well worthie) as much as anie man:
yet I am not ſo maried to him, (howſoeuer M. Doct.

of a haire, beyond truth and reaſon. Hee may bee
deceaued, aſwell as others, though he hath plunged

Nowe to returne againe, and to followe vpon your
walke: you charge mee heere (as euerie where) with
an vntruth. To faſten it vpon mee, you turne my
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:178019:24"/>
wordes out of their figured coate, into their bare
skinne. For whereas I ſay, that Chriſt ſuffered the
whole tormentes of hell vpon the croſſe, taking the
droſſe by a <hi>Synecdoche</hi> for the whole paſsion, as he did
before mee, which ſaid, <hi>God forbid, that I delight in any
thing,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 1. 18. Heb. 12. 2. Epheſ. 2. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>but in the croſſe of Chriſt. The preaching of the croſſe,
is to manie fooliſhnes. Chriſt reconciled vs to God by his
Croſſe.</hi> You tell mee, that it is moſt vntrue: becauſe
he did not ſuffer his whole torments on the wodden
Croſſe, which <hi>Symon</hi> the Cyrenian did beare on his
backe. And to make my wordes more odious, you
do them more injurie. For whereas I ſay, hee ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the whole tormentes of Hell on the Croſſe, a
thing defend-able: you charge mee, as ſaying he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
all his torments vpon the Croſſe, (meaning the
Croſſe of wood) a thing without ſhewe of truth. In
the ende, to faſten another little faulte on me, (it is
but blaſphemie,) you wring my laſt wordes in the

to be taken as ſhall ſeeme moſt probable: mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
that there is nothing in the word it ſelf, to lead
the mynde to one ſignification more then another:
but depends vpon the probable circumſtances, and
drift of the text: you charge mee, as making the

mens fantaſie will bend it: a thing as farre out of my

And in another place, <hi>This day ſhalt thou bee with mee
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:178019:24"/>
in Paradice.</hi> And heere it is a world to ſee, how men
on your ſide labour to put out this candel. Firſt, you
ſay, that this place, <hi>Father into thy hands I commend my
spirit,</hi> is borrowed of Dauid, and muſt bee taken in
the ſame ſenſe, as Dauid vſed it before. But you muſt
conſider, when we vſe other mens wordes, either we
cite them as teſtimonies, or vſurpe them by imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
If we bring them in as witneſſes, wee may not
alter their teſtimonie; but if wee imitate them, wee
may without impeachme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, apply them to what ſenſe
beſt may beſeeme our purpoſe. In this place Chriſt
citeth not Dauids wordes, to teſtifie of his paſsion:
but imitateth Dauid, in commending his ſoule into
the handes of God. Where you ſee, that no neceſsity
inforceth the ſame ſenſe. But, be it ſo, and I thinke
it is ſo, and that it maketh much againſt you. For ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Dauids ſoule comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded into the hands of God
was neuer in Hell: it will follow, that Chriſtes ſoule
commended to the ſame protector, was lykewiſe
neuer there: except you will aſcribe leſſe vertue to
Chriſts prayers, then to Dauids. But Dauids ſoule,
ſay you, went not ſtreight way into heaven; becauſe
he lived manie yeares after. That he liued anie long
time after, if it were denied, you will hardlie proue
it. But that maketh not to the queſtion, when Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids
ſoule, came into heauen. But whether hee that
commendeth his ſoule into the hands of God, doth
purpoſe that it ſhall deſcend into hell: prooue that,
and you ſhall haue the goall. As for Dauid, he hauing
deuoured heauen in hope, doubted not (if he liued
anie long time after) to ſpeake that in the praeſent
time, which he was well aſſured would come to pas.
And ſeeing Dauid was a figure of Chriſt, and ſpake
manie things in his owne perſon, which aggree bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
with the perſon figured, then with the figure:
theſe wordes may bee vnderſtood,<note place="margin">Pſal. 22. 16. 18</note> as the caſting of

lottes on his garment, and the digging of his hands
and feet. Wherefore, if you will anſwere this place,
to the ſatisfaction of them that diſſent from you:
you muſt bring proof, that hee that meaneth to goe
to Hell, doth commend his ſoule into the handes of
God: or els you ſhall neuer bee able to darken the
light of this Sunne, with anie cloude of Sophiſtrie.</p>

future time, may bee ſet for the preſent, eſpeciallye
when continuance is ſignified. Now, that it muſt be
ſo heere, I hope this Syllogiſme will perſwade you.
That verb which ſignifieth an action preſentlie done
when it is ſpoken, is of the preſent time. But this
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:178019:28"/>
verbe <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> doeth ſignifie an action then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentlie
done, when Chriſt vſed theſe wordes: <hi>Ergo,</hi>
this verbe is of the preſent time. The <hi>maior</hi> is a rule
of Grammer, from the definition of the preſent time
of a verbe. The <hi>minor</hi> is cleer of it ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe Chriſt
did then commend his ſoule into the hands of God,
when he vſed theſe wordes. But if this will not ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
you, take this to proue, that it cannot be the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
time. That action which can bee referred to no
time to come, cannot be the future time: But this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
cannot be referred to anie time to come: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he preſentlie gaue vp the ghoſt, and men after
death commend not their ſoules into the handes of
God. <hi>Ergo,</hi> this action cannot be of the future time.
And now, hauing taken all this paines, to gaine no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in your eies, but a ſhewe of trueth: I muſt put
you in minde, that though this verbe did pertaine to
the future time: yet your knot is in the wrong ruſhe.
For it is not the time when hee did commend, but
when his ſoule came into the handes of his Father,
that muſt helpe you, if you could bee holpen. And
therefore, you may whiſſel preſentlie for anie future
help, that the future time of this verb can yeeld you;
to ſhew my judgement of this place, all things both
in heauen, earth, and hell; be in the hands of God,
that is, in his power: to diſpoſe of them as it ſeemeth
meeteſt to his owne glorie. But that cannot bee the
ſenſe heere: becauſe his ſoule was in that ſenſe in the
hands of God, euen then, when he did commend it.
The hand is the inſtrument of receauing, in which
we rake thoſe things that we bring into our own pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiaritie,
and proper poſſeſsion. In that ſort Anthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>popathetcially,
thoſe ſoules and ſpirits which ſtande
in the preſence of God, are ſaid to be in his hand. Of
which it is ſaid in the Pſalme, <hi>In thy preſence is the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of ioy: and at thy right hand, pleaſures for euermore.</hi>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:178019:29"/>
And ſo Chriſt being in the agonies of death, and hel;
doth commend his ſoule into the handes of God to
poſſeſſe a fulneſſe of joy, and aeternitie of pleaſures.
Like to this is <hi>Stephans</hi> prayer, Act. 7. <hi>Lord Ieſus receiue
my ſpirit.</hi> Heere, after your wonted guiſe, you forme
my argument as pleaſeth you, and then you tell mee
it is falſe. If it be falſe, you made it ſuch. If the fault
had not beene more in your skill, or your will, or
both; then in the matter: you might haue made it <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</hi>
No man that commendeth his ſoule into the
hands of God, meaneth to go to hell: But Chriſt, as
man, did commend his ſoule into the hands of God:
<hi>Ergo,</hi> he ment not to go to Hel. And if he meant not,
I am perſwaded, hee went not. If you had framed it
thus, there had beene no neede of <hi>Procuſtes</hi> with his
racke, nor of anie patche to make it fit our waſte.
To the <hi>maior</hi> of this argument, for lack of better ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
you crie out, blaſphemie. And then finding no
blaſphemy in the words themſelues: you tel me that
they inſinuate, that Chriſt is but a meere man, and
that others haue part in the worke of our redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Your inſinuations are verie deepe. But heere M.
Doctor, I will offer you a good bargaine. Hooke me
this inſinuation on my propoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in mood &amp; figure,
and I will neuer write more againſt you on this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.
And now I muſt needes note an eſpeciall grace
in your writing. When the argument pincheth you,
you wring it with a crooked wreſt, and ſtraining out
ſome filthie licour, that you your ſelf had powred v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
it, you call witneſſes to ſhewe the worlde, what
filthie geare it is. And ſo with manie teſtimonies, in
thinges that no man that hath one dramme of ſenſe
will denie, you make vp a ſhamfull, and importable
booke. Heere, to proue that Chriſt is our onelie Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
(a thing not denied) you bring in <hi>Luther, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi>
and <hi>Theophilact.</hi> Neither apply you them to the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:178019:29"/>
purpoſe, though the purpoſe be eaſier to proue; then
the things you apply them to. But your wandering
hand, cannot beate on one Anvil. And wheras I ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the vantage of your conſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of theſe words
whereon we ſtand, <hi>Father into thy handes I commend my
ſpirite:</hi> thus proue, that Chriſts ſoule went no more
to Hell, then Dauids. If theſe wordes haue the ſame
ſenſe in Chriſts mouth, as they had in Dauids, Chriſt
ſoule went no more to Hel, then Dauids did. But you
ſay, they haue the ſame ſenſe, <hi>Ergo.</hi> you let goe the
<hi>maior</hi> and the <hi>minor:</hi> and take vp your vſuall hubub
againſt the concluſion, exclayming and crying out,
blaſphemie. Then running about, and ſeeking <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanaſius</hi>
in euerie corner, to chide mee: becauſe I
giue Chriſts ſoule and body no greater prerogatiue
then Dauids, you bring him in, not ſaying one word
to the purpoſe. For he (good-man) knew right well
that Chriſt was like to Dauid, and vs all; in all things
ſinne onlie excepted: and therefore would not ſpeak
againſt his conſcience. As for the praerogatiue that
you woulde haue him to haue, to goe to hell, it is ſo
baſe a one (if it was anie) that if Biſhoppricks were
no better, Doctors woulde not ſhoulder for them,
like beggers at a doall. Whereas you argue, that if
Chriſts ſoule had not gone to Hel, Dauids muſt, and
yours and mine: if you meane the hel of the damned
(as you muſt if you ſpeak to the purpoſe) it is abſurd.
For Chriſt redeemed vs on the Croſſe, where hee did
beare the helliſhe burden of our ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>nes: and not in
hell, where hee paied not one dram of our debt. To
ſet a wrong ſenſe on this place, you bring foorth a
heap of handes, inough almoſte to remoue Cheviot
hill to Charing Croſſe. Whereupon you conclude,
that the ſenſe muſt needes be: Into thy conſolation,
mercie, protection and gouernement, I will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
my ſoule<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If that was his meaning, why did he
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:178019:30"/>
not commend his bodie alſo in the hands of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
And why delaied he this praier till the ſtorme
of his miſeries was blowne ouer. If this concluſion,
did follow vpon the premiſſes, it were a fault to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
it. But nowe I hope vpon a pardon, though I
wipe it away with a Syllogiſme. Conſolation pertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
to the diſtreſſed, mercie to the guiltie, protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the weake, and gouernment to them, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cannot, or will not keepe order. But Chriſtes
ſoule, after this praier, was neither diſtreſſed, guiltie,
weake, nor diſorderlie: <hi>Ergo,</hi> he commended not his
ſoule into Gods conſolation, mercie, protection, and
gouernement. This is all, that in all this ſection, you
haue ſpoken to the purpoſe. You haue (I muſt needs
confeſſe) a great deale of other ſtuffe, as much as all
this. In one place you ignorantly charge vs, that we
giue Chriſt not a perſonall, but a potentiall diſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
into Hel. For we ſay, that Chriſt deſcended per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonallie
into Hell,<note place="margin">That is called potentiall which being is not impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, neuer was indeed</note>
both bodie and ſoule, and ſuffered
actuallie all the torments thereof, for our redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Otherwiſe, were he but a potentiall Saviour, and
all wee actuallie condemned. You quote alſo heere
out of place, and to ſmall purpoſe, the 10. and 11.
verſes of the 4. to the Epheſ. which might haue bene
deferred more convenientlie, to the 8. 9. and 10.
ſection, where it is handled of purpoſe. Out of it
you gather firſt an abſurditie. That, if the ſame
Chriſt did aſcend, and deſcended: hee deſcended in
ſoule and bodie, or elſe he could not haue beene the
ſame. Did you neuer heare, that the ſame Chriſt was
from all aeternitie: that the ſame Chriſt was ſlaine
from the beginning of the worlde: that the ſame
Chriſt lay three dayes in the graue, as <hi>Ionas</hi> was three
dayes and three nights, in the whales bellie. And yet
I truſt, you will not ſay, that his ſoule and bodie was
from all aeternitie: that his ſoule and body was ſlain
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:178019:30"/>
from the beginning: &amp; ſure I am, that you that ſtand
ſo much, that the ſoule can not bee buried, will not
ſay, that hee lay three dayes ſoule and bodie in the
graue. Your wonderfull manner, in which you ſay
theſe things were effected, is a wonderfull Sophiſme.
You ſeeme to thinke, that there were no wonder in
Chriſtes deſcending, except this place be vnderſtood
of his deſcending into hell: as if it were not as great
a wonder, that the ſonne of God deſcended into the
wombe of a Virgine, and there did cloath himſelf in
mans nature. But all this wonderfull diſcourſe of
wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders, is beſide the text. After all theſe by-blowes,
you gather vpon this text a reaſon, againſt the main
concluſion. That Chriſts ſoule was not in heauen,
while his bodie laie in the graue: becauſe then hee
ſhould haue aſcended, before he deſcended, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
to the place of the Eph. There be two errours in
the levelling of this peece, that beares it quite beſide
the marke. Firſt, you giue the name of aſcending to
the ſoule, without the bodie, contrarie to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
Act. 2. 34. <hi>Dauid is not yet aſcended.</hi> And this ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
away your next reaſon, of two aſcenſions. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condlie,
you giue the name of deſcending, to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending
of his humanitie into hell, which is ſpoken
by the Apoſtle of the Deſcending of his Deitie in his
humane ſtate. Thus a man may ſee your wit, howe

Chriſt brought the theef from the croſſe to Paradice,
leaſt any man ſhould think conuerſion to be too late
at any time: hee made the puniſhment of homicide
Martirdome: the truth being counted among the

iudgement. It<note n="162" place="margin">Wil not Ierome ſpeak plainelie? this collectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath in it three pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralogiſmes. 1.

                  <hi>Auguſtine</hi> hath the like on this place,
The croſſe, if you marke it is the iudgement ſeate, the

was condemned. To ſaue and condemne is the office

to <hi>Stephanus.</hi> If he had chanced to write <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> with a

onlie ſo manie: neither can I finde juſt that nom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ber
in that place, whither you ſend mee. The firſt
name in that place, and the onlie name for any thing
that I can ſee, is IEHOVAH, the very eſſential name
of God. The reſt be Epithets, not names. But tell in

                  </gap> the ſame in greek,
that IEHOVAH is in Hebrew? I euer took IEHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VAH,
to come from HAIAH: a verbe of beeing,
to declare, that God the cauſe of all beeings, hath no
cauſe of his owne beeing. And <gap reason="foreign">

20. pag. 1 of your printed ſermon, &amp; here in this ſame

(this day,) is; that to day is an indefinite, &amp; this day,
a particular. But this was ſo ſubtile, in your prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

had you. For <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> is ſo particular of it ſelf, that it

and Parſon of <hi>Gooſage,</hi> can be made more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular

reacheth far beyond the praecepts that you lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the Vniverſitie: and yet I ſee, that it commeth
much ſhort of that which is in you. For, you will not
onelie affirme it, but confirme it alſo, that <hi>hodie eris
mecum,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Thou ſhalt be this day with me, is aſmuch as thou ſhalt be with mee for euer. Pſal. 90. 4.</note> is aſmuch, as <hi>eris mecum in aeternum.</hi> If you wil
make that good, you may goe whether you will; no
hedge can holde you. The Scripture hath by way of
compariſon, that 1000. yeares are as one day in the
ſight of the Lord. If all aeternitie bee in your ſight,
but as one day: you muſt be ſome <hi>magnus Apollo,</hi> ſo
much greater then God, as aeternitie is more then
1000. yeares. But, what can you make of 1000. yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,
that can make ſo much of one day. One day I
am ſure, is not the proper name of aeternitie. And
therefore I would faine know of a man of your skill,
ſeeing when one word vſurpeth the place of another
(except it be like the Popes <hi>ſtatuimus</hi> for <hi>abrogamus</hi>) it
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:178019:36"/>

ſimile pro ſimile pars pro toto, aut contra:</hi> to which of theſe
heades you will referre <hi>hodie pro aeterno.</hi> If you thinke
it <hi>pars pro toto,</hi> then in your conceit, the partes of a
thing infinite, muſt be finite, contrarie to an axiome
eſteemed for truth amongſt other men: that an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
thing, is not deuide-able. Heereof commeth the
maxime, that you after alledge out of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> that
in things aeternall, there is no time. You by it, (enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teling
it the Philoſophicall reaſon of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>) vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
to proue, that one day, doth ſignifie aeternitie:
but ſtreight way, by nimble convoiance of legerde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine,
you ſlip the thing you promiſe, &amp; turne your
hand to proue <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> philoſophicall reaſon. For, if
there be time (ſay you) in aeternitie, then is there mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Thus, like a merchaunt that fraughting his
ſhips with corne to go to <hi>Deep,</hi> when ſhee is lanched
forth into the ſea, turneth his ſaill, and pointeth to
<hi>Spaine:</hi> You pretending to proue, that one day, muſt
needes heere ſignifie aeternitie: fall to proue that in
aeternitie there is no time, a thing neuer denied. But
reaſon woulde haue hewed an other peece of worke,
out of <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> block; In aeternitie there is no time:
In one day, there is time: <hi>Ergo,</hi> one day is not aeterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
But to proue this, you alledge four texts of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which are all but the repetitions of one, out of
the 2. Pſalme, wherein you are deceiued your ſelf, &amp;
labour to deceaue others. For (to day) in that place
doth not ſignifie <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eternity, as <hi>Iunius</hi> proueth finelie in
his Parallels. The words be, <hi>Thou art my ſonne, this day
haue I begotten thee.</hi> Wherein (ſaith hee) is noted, firſt
the aeternall begetting of his Deitie, in theſe wordes,
<hi>Thou art my ſonne:</hi> and the temporall begetting of his
humanitie in theſe wordes, <hi>to day haue I begotten thee.</hi>
His reaſon is drawne from the place of Paule, which
heere you quote, Act. 13. For, he alledging this place
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:178019:36"/>
to the Iewes in their Synagogue, as a plaine argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
of Chriſts Divinitie, could neuer haue hoped to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
that amongſt ſuch a froward companie, if he had
put ſuch a violent face on the text, as to take one day
for all aeternitie. To this moſt excellent reaſon, I add
another out of the ſame text. This place of the pſalm
doth proue, that God raiſed vp Ieſus to fulfill that
promiſe to the Children, which he before had made
to their Fathers. But that promiſe was then perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
when Ieſus was given to them in the fleſh. <hi>Ergo,</hi>
this place of the Pſalme, muſt haue relation to that
day, when the ſonne of God, which was before all ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternitie,
was giuen to the Iewes in the fleſh. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
theſe reaſons, if it were granted you, (which
you can neuer proue) that (to day) in this place of
the Pſalme doth ſignifie aeternitie, yet it will not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that it muſt needes haue the ſame ſignification
in theſe words of Chriſt likewiſe. Wherefore to fill
this ditch, you fal to worke vpon the text. In it you
make along harueſt of little corne, telling in manie
wordes, that grace, glorie, &amp; aeternall life, the things
giuen, are aeternall. But, what makes the aeternitie of
the gift, or of the giuer, to proue that the time wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it was giuen, is aeternall? Of things aeternall, onlie
God (who is aeternitie it ſelfe) is without beginning,
and ending. Grace, glorie, and aeternall life, impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to his creatures of the fulneſſe of his aeternitie,
haue a beginning then when they are giuen, though
their continuance be aeternall. Now<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in theſe words,
<hi>This day thou ſhalt bee with mee,</hi> (this day) noteth the
time, when this aeternall gift ſhould begin, and not
the continuance and durance thereof. This may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſe
to cruſh all the ſmall bones of your ſhrimpiſh ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.
As for your Fathers &amp; Doctors, whom you

all this, you runne ſuch a treble on mee with
vntruthes: that if I would runne the counter-tenor,
you would bluſhe to heare the diſcorde of your owne

all Hebricians, nor vnderſtood the word wherin you
ſay, they tooke your parte. Secondlie, though ſome
of them drewe neere your opinion: yet they neuer
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:178019:39"/>
wrote of SHEOL to bee taken, as you will haue it.
Thridlie, <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> held that the ſoule of Chriſt
did preſent it ſelf to all the dead, aſwel the bleſſed, as
the damned. Fourthlie, <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Latimer</hi> holde,
that Chriſt ſuffered in Hell. Fiftlie, <hi>Loſſius</hi> and <hi>Hemin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gsus</hi>
holde, that the whole Chriſt, as he was borne of
the Virgine Marie, deſcended into Hel. Sixtlie, <hi>Mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerus</hi>
affirmeth that your opinion cannot be proved
by this place of this Pſalme. Seuinthly, <hi>M. Nowell</hi> hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
that Chriſt by the vertue of his death did pearſe
to the dead, and the damned Hell. Eightlie, <hi>Lambert</hi>
ſaith nothing for you, but onelie quoteth a place out
of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> to another purpoſe, wherein <hi>Auguſt.</hi>
ſeemeth to ſay, as you ſay. But <hi>Lambert</hi> neither ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
nor diſlyketh it. Nynthlie, <hi>Robert Samuell,</hi> ſaith
no more for you, then the verie wordes of the beleef.
Tenthlie, in <hi>M. Foxes</hi> book of Chriſt triumphing, ther
is not anie thing for you, but the Printers picture,
which you haue alſo ſet before your owne booke.
Laſtlie, <hi>Felinus</hi> and <hi>Pomeranus</hi> are with vs, and againſt
you. Such is your skill to bleare the blinde, &amp; make
him thinke, that your foes are your friends. Thus if
a man could intend to trace you, he might finde you
quatt in manie buſhes, where you want couer to hide
your bunne. If anie writer name but Hell, it is y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to make you bragge, that he is youres. As for
the other vntruth wherewith you charge me, it is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
ſect. 4. Yet becauſe you think heere to winn
the ſpurres, and haue bragged amongſt your frends,
that in this place you haue driuen mee ſo neere the
hedge, that I can neuer eſcape you, without the foile;
it may be, that that conceit may contem my anſwer.
Prejudice is a ſtrong baye, and will beare a maine
ſtrength before it breake. Wherefore heere I will
onelie turn the cock, and make it ſpout the ſame wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

cloake, to keepe your ſhoulders from the ſhoure.
You holde that SHEOL in the 16. Pſalme doth ſignify
the locall Hell, wherein the damned are tormented.
That this is vntrue, it is manifeſt, not by conceit, but
by Peters ſermon. Act. 2. 31. <hi>Hee knowing this before,
spake of the reſurrection, that his ſoule was not left in Hell,
nor his fleſh ſaw corruption.</hi> You ſay, it is ſpoken of the
locall Hell, wherein the damned are puniſhed, Peter
ſaieth it is ſpoken of the reſurrection: and good caus
hath hee, ſo to ſay. For the wordes going before, and
comming after, do proue it. The words going before
are theſe. Pſa. 16. 9. Wherefore my hart was glad, my
glorie (to vſe your own tranſlatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, leſt you ſay, I alter
your words) rejoiceth, my fleſh alſo, ſhal reſt in hope.
The words following in the 11. verſe, are theſe. Thou
ſhalt ſhew mee the path of life, in thy preſence is the
fulneſſe of joy, and at thy right hand, are pleaſures
for euermore. Where can you finde your locall Hell,
wherin is weeping and gnaſhing of teeth, in the word
(glad,) or in the worde (rejoiceth,) or in the woorde
(reſt,) or in the wordes (fulneſſe of joy,) or in theſe
wordes (pleaſure for euermore.) Was Chriſt glad of
that doole-full and dread-ful place? Who would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer
this doctrine, but hee, that wanteth either ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
or conſcience, or both. To lie once is a fault,
but to affirme twiſe, is a greater fault: To ſpeak a lie
is hurtfull, but to write a lie adviſedlie, is more hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
To lie in a matter Politicall, is dangerous: but
to lie in divine matters, without ſpeedie repentance,
is damnable. Thus far you. This is your owne ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerlie
tale, filed on your owne vice, and taken out of
your printed booke. Wherein you giue your ſelfe
roundly and handſomly the ſingle-lie, the double-lie
the hurtfull-lie, the adviſed-lie, the dangerous-lie, &amp;
the damnable-lie. If I had blowne this wind in your
face, you would haue ſaid, that I had beene bred in
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:178019:40"/>
an Oxe-ſtall. As for your opinion on this place of
the Pſalme, I haue two ſore ſhot againſt it. That SHE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OL
heere can no waies bee the locall hell. Firſt it is in
the Hebrew SHEOL, and in the 70. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: <hi>Thou wilt
not leaue my ſoule to hell:</hi> and this place of the Actes,
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is not true greeke, except you vnderſtand <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> as you note your ſelf out of Clenard. ſect. 14.
Now, thou wilt not leaue my ſoule to Hell, cannot
be vnderſtood of a praeſentiall beeing in the place of
hell: <hi>Ergo,</hi> this place cannot be vnderſtood of Chriſt
that he was in the locall Hell. If you bee ſo good a
Graecian, as you would be taken, you ſhould not bee
ignorant, that to make your ſenſe, it ſhould be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
The other is this. No man reioiceth that hee
is deliuered from a place wherein hee ſuffered no ill;
but Chriſt heere rejoyceth verſ. 26. and 27. that hee
ſhould not bee left in SHEOL: <hi>Ergo,</hi> SHEOL is not heer
the place of the damned, wherein you ſay, he trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phed,
and joyed, and ſuffered no kinde of ill. As for
my ſcience and conſcience, which heere you ſtrike at,
you praiſe them your ſelfe (ſuch is your conſtancie)
in the beginning of your 12. ſection. I knowe mine
owne infirmities, and dare not accept your praiſes.
As for my knowledge, I am content that men count
of it, as they finde it. As for my life, I dare not bragg
neither will I ſpeake anie thing <hi>abſolute:</hi> but <hi>compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,</hi>
this much I will ſay, (ſeeing you put mee to it)
that where wee are both knowne, I can finde more
mouthes to ſpeake my purgation, (if I holde but vp
my finger) then your ſelf can procure by freendes &amp;
meanes. You confeſſe, (which manie men wold think
though you confeſſed it not) that <hi>Tremelius</hi> and <hi>Iuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
are better Hebricians, then your ſelf: and affirme
that the Iewes are better then they. For my parte, it
is beyond my skill to make compariſons: and my
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:178019:41"/>
blinde eies can ſee no reaſon for that oddes. But as
you will not beleeue the Iewes, (you ſay) no more
will you <hi>Tremelius</hi> and <hi>Iunius,</hi> againſt <hi>Dauid</hi> &amp; <hi>Peter.</hi>
You haue reaſon for you. Yet til you proue it, other
men will ſuſpect, that <hi>Tremelius</hi> and <hi>Iunius</hi> had both
as much care, and as great judgement, to keepe in
with Dauid and Peter, as you. And for anie thing we
ſee, it is credible inough, that Dauid, Peter, and
they doe drawe all one way. If you will beleeue the
Iewes in nothing, you doe them wrong. If all men
had been as hard laced as you, no man had euer got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Hebrew of them. You anſwere the antecedent
of my argument, which you call a curious queſtion,
without curious meditation. It ſhoulde ſeeme that
the queſtion was more curious in your tongue, then
your eies, that you can anſwere ſo readilie. You tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle
and tell mee, that you read but of one Hell. And I
anſwere you, that he who in ſerious matters of faith
can finde a cavill <hi>a rebus ad voces,</hi> will hardlie find cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite
of ſincere dealing. Did not you ſee, that I ſpake
of the three things ſignified in that name, and not of
the damneds Hell onelie, which hath almoſt gotten
the Engliſh name to it ſelf, from the other two. For
my part I neuer thought it a thing vnpoſsible, for a
ſoule to diſcend into Hell, before the buriall of the
body: but that Chriſts ſoule ſhould deſcend into hel
and returne againe, (for ſo the wordes of the Pſalme
doth ſound, (<hi>Thou wilt not leaue my ſoule in Hel</hi>) before
the buriall of the bodie, as the words do lie in order,
I euer held it, and holde it yet a thing, that you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
ſaw, and impoſsible for you to prooue with wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes.
But in one thing you ſeeme farre heere to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-ſhoot
your ſelfe. Your mates reaſon againſt vs,
that the pangs of Hell, which went before the buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
cannot bee ment by theſe wordes following it.
You open your owne ſide to that blowe, and put the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:178019:41"/>
diſcending into the locall Hell, before his buriall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
and make that argument ſtronger againſt your
ſelf, then you finde it againſt vs. Thus you ſee, al this
great winde is ouerblowne, and ſhakes no corne.</p>

               <p>FIrſt marke, that by a general axiome, whatſoeuer
a man alledgeth to proue a thing, either doutfull
or vnknowne: the ſame muſt be better knowne, and
inforce ſuch a neceſsitie of conſequence, as cannot
be denied. The thing that you haue heere in hand to
proue, is, that (the lowermoſt parts of the earth) is as
proper and peculiar a name for the place of the dam<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned,
as Hell is in Engliſh. To proue this, your teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
ſhould be without controulment. But are in
deede ſo farre ſhort of that marke, that they are, (if
not harder) altogether as hard and obſcure, as the
place, that they are alleadged to illuſtrate. The firſt
of them I haue diſpatched in the former ſection. The
next is out of the 24. of Eccleſ. a booke not Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,
nor written in the tongue, whereon wee ſtand.
In which reſpect, I might haue rejected it. But becaus
one anſwere ſerued it, and your third place out of
31. 18. of Ezech. I joined them together. The firſte
was, <hi>I will pearce through the lowermoſt parts of the earth,
and looke on them that hee a ſleepe.</hi> The ſecond, <hi>Thou ſhalt
be caſt downe into the lowermoſt parts of the earth, and ſleep
in the middeſt of the vncircumciſed.</hi> To them thus I aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.
There is ſleep, that is reſt and quietneſſe, in
the place called heere the lower-moſte partes of the
earth: But there is no reſt nor quietneſſe in Hell, the
place of the damned: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the place called heer the
lowermoſt parts of the earth, is not Hell, the place of
the damned. For the firſt of your places, you ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to this argument. For the ſecond, you ſay,
that the word (ſleepe) is vſed Ironicallie, that is, in a
ſcornfull and mocking manner, and a contrarie ſenſe
For proof, (for want of text) you take vp the conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts
of the 14. of Eſay: and <hi>Lauater,</hi> who ſaith, that <hi>Balta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:178019:49"/>
was receaued amongeſt the deade: (for ſo is the
true ſenſe) with bitter ſcoffes. Firſt, conſider that
the figure in the 14. of Eſay, is a <hi>ſarcaſmus,</hi> not an <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronia,</hi>
conſiſting of bitter words vſed in their vſual ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications.
Secondlie, that your authors are but me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
Thirdlie, that they ſay nothing of the word (ſleepe)
which Ezech.<note place="margin">Gen. 47. 30.</note> vſeth. Laſtlie, that you haue (ſleep) ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
hundreth times,<note place="margin">Math. 9. 24.</note> attributed in the Scriptures to
the dead:<note place="margin">Mark. 5. 39.</note> but neuer to the ſtate of the damned, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

We muſt not wring words out of jointe by an <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronia,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. King. 2. 10.</note>
except ſome neceſſarie inducement in the text,<note place="margin">Luk. 8. 52.</note>

is neither inducement in the text,<note place="margin">1. King. 14. 20.</note> nor abſurditie in
the letter:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7. 39.</note> 
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> heere we muſt not wring this worde
out of jointe in this text,<note place="margin">1. King. 21. 51.</note> and take it from the vſuall
ſignifications, in other places of the Scripture. This
argument is ſo ſtrong, and prevailed ſo much with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
writers, that you cannot finde one to take your
part in this mocke. If you could, we ſhould haue his
name, with the higheſt ſtiles of antiquitie, learning,
and aeſtimation, that anie ſhewe coulde yeelde him.
Whereas you can with no colour hyde this blot, in
the 24. of Eccleſ. there you run another courſe, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading
mee, that if I had read that that goeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and commeth after, I would haue beene of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
minde. And affirming, that the whole chapter
ſpeaketh of the Sonne of God, and his wonderfull
workes in ſaving, &amp;c. You are ſomewhat deceaued
of mee. For I haue read the whole chapter, and more
then that, haue conſidered the matter in it. The
whole Chapter ſeemeth to mee a <hi>Proſopopoia</hi> of the
Wiſdome, which God in his worde, and the light of
nature hath left vnto man: praiſing her ſelfe in the
co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gregation. That the authour ſpeaketh onelie of
that Wiſdome, (except you will make him leaue his
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:178019:50"/>
ground, and wander from his ſubject) it is plaine, by
the 11. and 12. verſes: where ſhe ſaith of her ſelf, that
he that made and created her, appointed her an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation
in Sion. Which cannot bee vnderſtood of
the aeternall Wiſdome of God, which was neither
made, nor created, but begotten. Whereas ſhee ſaith
in the ſixt verſe, that ſhe cauſeth the light that faileth
not to riſe in the heauens, and covered the earth as
a cloude. If you take light, for the knowledge of god
the heauens for his church, and the earth for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate,
as they are in diuerſe places of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
there is nothing in al this chapter, diſ-agreing
with this ſubject. That ſhee proceedeth from the
mouth of the moſt higheſt: that ſhe is the firſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> borne
of all creatures: that ſhe was created from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and made before the worlde: and that ſhe ſhall
neuer faile, may be well vnderſtood of the worde of
God, which came from his own mouth, and ſhall not
periſh one jot of it, though heauen and earth doeth
paſſe. As for the 8. verſe, which you ſay woulde haue
changed my minde, that ſhe alone hath gone about
the compaſſe of the heavens, and walked in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome
of the depth: I ſhould ſooner take it for natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
wiſedome, proceeding alſo from God; which ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
viewe of all his creatures from the higheſt hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens,
to the loweſt center of the earth, doeth after a
ſort walke about them, and vnder them: then for the
aeternall wiſedom of God, with whom diuerſe things
in this chapter, will in no wiſe agree. Thus I ſee, that
there is no thing in this chap. to perſwade mee, that
the wiſdome heere ſpoken of, is the Sonne of God.
But ſuppoſe there were, yet heere is nothing to help
your cauſe. You know that the generall queſtion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
you and mee, is not of the ſonne of God: but
of the ſonne of man, that is, of Chriſtes humanitie,
whether it did deſcend into the locall Hel. Of him, I
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:178019:50"/>
will ſtand to it to your face, that there is not one ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable
in all this chapter, neither of his bodie, nor of
his ſoule, neither amongſt the living, nor amongeſt
the dead, in the graue, nor in Hell. Wherfore, (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
I haue read this chap.) you haue read it more
then well, that haue found matter in it, that no man
(but you) euer ſaw in it. The particular queſtion in
this part of the ſection, is whether the lower-moſte
parts of the earth, in the 37. verſe of this Chap. doth
ſignifie the Hel of the damned: to which this allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and the other out of Iob is ſo impertinent, that
I wonder you could hope, that they woulde holde
way. For, what maketh it to this queſtion, that the
wiſdome of God doth compaſſe the heauens, and
walke in the bottome of the depth: that it entreth
into the bottome of the ſea, or hath ſeene the gates
of death. You are neere be-ſtead, that are driven ſo
farre for reaſons. Thus much (though it be Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phall)
for the place of Eccleſiaſtes. As for the other
place of Ezechiell, before you came to the anſwere,
which I haue ſet downe before for orders ſake: you
endevoured to proue by Eſay and Ezech<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
for you, after your owne manner, which is, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to trouble your aduerſarie with newe reaſons,
then to anſwere them that are in hand. For your
proof, you quote the 14. 9. of Eſay, and the 15. and
16. verſes of the ſame chapter of Ezechiell. Where
you ſay, both the Prophetes call the place, into the
which theſe Kings are caſte, moſt plainelie, Hel. And
wondering at me, that I dare interprete it graue, you
note in your margent, Hume diſagreeth with Eſay.
Ezech, Munſter, Lavater, and Pelilcan. But heere M.
D. I pray you let mee aske a queſtion. In what lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
wrote thoſe Prophetes? Was the verie word
they vſed, hell? If not that, (as I think you will gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t)
but the hebrew word SHEOL, which doth ſignifie the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:178019:51"/>
graue, rather then Hell, why may I not take the one
ſignification, as well as you the other. Thus with
your bolde daring, you dare the ſimple, as men doe
larkes. But heere, now knowe, (if you knowe it not)
that I haue ſuch reaſons, not to take your ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of SHEOL heere, as ſhoulde carie you as well as
mee, if your wit were not maried to your wil. Firſt,
though the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> and <hi>Babilonians,</hi> of whome the
Prophetes ſpeak in theſe places, were heathens, and
damnable miſcreants: yet it was not their purpoſe
to ſpeake heere of their aeternall damnation: but of
the diſhonorable deſtruction of their temporal king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes.
Secondlie, that which Eſay in the 9. verſ. cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
Hell: he calleth four times the graue, and twiſe
the pit, in the ſame chap. Thirdlie, in the ſame ver.
which you quote, hee ſaieth, that hell raiſing vp the
dead, even all the Princes of the earth, did meete the
king of Babell. But all the dead, euen the Princes of
the earth, were not in the Hell of the da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
in the 11. ver. he calleth the place into the which
the King of Babell was brought, the graue: with
wormes vnder, and ouer him. But that cannot be the
place of the damned: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the place, of which he ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
heere, cannot be the place of the damned. Fift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
in the 15. and 16. verſes hee ſaieth, When hee was
brought downe to the graue, to the ſides of the pit,
they that ſawe him ſhoulde ſay, is this hee that made
the earth to tremble? But men coulde not ſee and
looke into his falling into the place of the damned:
<hi>Ergo,</hi> the place whereof he there ſpeaketh, is not the
place of the damned. Thus much for Eſay. For E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zechiel.
Firſt, in the 14. verſe, he joyneth the lower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſte
parts of the earth, with them that goe downe
into the pit: and in the 16. verſe, hee joineth the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to hell, with the ſame. But to deſcend into the pit
is to goe downe into the graue, not into hell: <hi>Ergo,</hi>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:178019:51"/>
both the lower-moſt partes of the earth, and SHE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OL,
heere is taken for the graue. Secondlie, in the
ſame 14. verſe, the nether partes of the earth, is the
pit and place of death, common to all the children
of men: But the pit and place of death, common to
all men, is not the place of the damned: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the low
er-moſt partes of the earth, is not heere the place of
the damned. Thirdlie, in the 16. verſe, The Lord did
make the nations of the earth to ſhake, at the ſound
of his fall, when he did caſt him downe into Hell. But
the nations of the earth, heard not, nor felt not his
fall into the Hell of the damned: <hi>Ergo,</hi> this is not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
of the Hell of the damned. All theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
had I, and they made mee dare to tranſlate
SHEOL, (not the place of the damned) but graue.
And therfore (M. Doctor) you may ceaſe to wonder
at mee, if you will. And nowe I muſt wonder alſo at
your manner of reaſoning. That the lower-moſte
partes of the earth, doeth ſignifie Hell, (ſaye you)
I will prooue it by the 12. verſe of the ſame Chap. of
Ezech. And the ſtrangers haue deſtroyed him, euen
the terrible nations, &amp;c. Then, not finding your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
there, you runne to Munſter, Lavater and Pelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane,
that the King of Asſhur was the prey of carni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorous
byrds: and yet not finding to ſatisfie you, you
wring out a conſequence, that if he was deuoured of
beaſts, then he was not buried: if he was not buried,
then hee was not in the graue: If he was not in the
graue, then the lowermoſt parts of the earth wherin
he was, muſt needs be Hell. Where I tell you, I muſt
needs wonder, how you could leape ſo many ditches
without a ſtaffe, to finde Hell in this verſe. For all the
load you lay vpon me here of ignorance, &amp; miſvſing
the text: I did not take one ſuch leape in all my Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
As for my inſtance out of the 139. pſalme, that
SHEOL, doth not alwayes ſignifie Hell, but may ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:178019:52"/>
the mothers wombe, you ſay it is childiſh rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
&amp; prooue it with a Catholik rule, that <hi>Argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum

you mean by an argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, <hi>à metaphora.</hi> This is the firſt

place: yet I haue heard good argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts in meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorical
words. Chriſt himſelf, the beſt logician that
euer I knew, had wont to make many ſuch. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.
The ſeruant that putteth not his Lords talent

<hi>Ergo,</hi> all miniſters that labor not faithfully in their
charge, ſhal be caſt into vtter darknes, &amp;c. I beleeue at
the latter day, when arguments wil be as well ſifted,
as euer they were in the ſchool-ſtreats at Oxen. this
will be found a good argument, for all the <hi>metaphora</hi>
that is in it. As for my argument, I ſee not how it is a
<hi>metaphora.</hi> Though the ſignification of the word be
metaphorical (as Caluin wel noteth:) yet it ſerueth
my turne to prooue, that it is not alwayes Hell. And
now you put me in minde of it, I will picke another
argument out of the ſame place, that perhapps will
trouble you worſe: That is, the naturall ſignification
of euery worde, whence the metaphoricall is taken.
But this ſignification of theſe wordes (the lowermoſt
parts of the earth) is taken from the dennes and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernes
of the earth, as you note me out of Caluine.
<hi>Ergo,</hi> the proper<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſignification of this worde, is the
dennes and cauernes of the earth and not Hell of the
damned. Of this judgement is Mercerus, Cevalerus,
and Cornelius Bertramus, in their additions to Pag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nines
Lexicon. You confute Beza and me, for apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
theſe wordes to the place of the Epheſ. thus, He
that deſcended, is euen the ſame that aſcended: But
he aſcended in ſoule and bodie. <hi>Ergo,</hi> he deſcended in
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:178019:52"/>
ſoule and bodie, which is not true of his deſcending
into the virgins womb. And here you charge vs with
ignoraunce, or wilfull denying the Incarnation of
Chriſt. Good M. D. vſe me as you wil, but be good to
Beza: he hath bene well thought of as yet. I wonder,
that ſeeing ſo much againſt him and me, you coulde
not ſee the ſame againſt your ſelf. You hold that this
is ment of his deſcending into the local Hell: againſt
which, thus I vſe your owne reaſon: He that deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
is euen the ſame that aſcended: But he aſcended
bodie &amp; ſoule: <hi>Ergo,</hi> he deſcended into Hell bodie &amp;
ſoule: a thing that you haue not yet granted. Howe
you will anſwere for your ſelfe, I leaue it to yourſelf.
I haue anſwered ſect. 5. for Beza and me: ſee there.
We denie not the incarnation of Chriſt, you purge vs
your ſelf within fiue lines. Wherfore you might haue
let Theoph. alone, if you had no more skill to proue
thinges not denyed, then the things in queſtion and
controuerted.</p>

Sonne of God, firſt came downe into the lower-moſt
partes of the earth, and tooke on him mans nature:
ſo that hee which deſcended, is euen the ſelfe ſame
that is aſcended to fulfill all things, and giueth nowe

that he deſcended from. To ouerthrowe this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation,
you alledge that the Hebrew wordes E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RETSTACHTITH,
is in that language the proper name
of Hell. To proue it, you alledge the places which
I haue confuted in the former 2. ſectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. After which
labour,<note place="margin">One motion hath but one beginning &amp; one ending. Of contrarie motions (if the mouer be one) the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the one, is the end of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe the end of the one, is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the other.</note> I gathered ſome reaſons from the infallible

For example, Eaſt and Weſt: South, and North:
vp and downe, are contraries. If anie thing runne
weſt-warde, and return eaſt-ward: the furtheſt point
that it runneth towards the weſt, is the beginning of
the motion towards the eaſt: or, if a man come down
a high hill, and returne vp againe: The loweſt ſteppe
that he came downe, is the firſt ſtep of his going vp.
Whervpon thus I reſoned. The beginning of Chriſts
aſcending, was the end of his deſcending. But his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending
was from this earth, whereon we converſe,
<hi>Ergo,</hi> the end of this deſcending was onelie to this
earth, whereon we conuerſe, and not into hell, as you
gather out of this place. My <hi>maior</hi> is proued by the
ſecond rule, becauſe the mouer is one, Chriſt, &amp; the
motions contrarie, aſcending and deſcending: The
<hi>minor</hi> is proued Mark. 16. 19. Luke. 26. 51. Act. 1, 9. &amp;
by al the Symbols, or ſummes of our faith by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
conſent of all Divines, and the vſuall ſpeach of
all Chriſtians, that euer was, or is. To this you an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere,
that the <hi>maior</hi> is vtterlie falſe, becauſe Chriſt
ſaith, Mat, 12. 40. <hi>At Ionas was three dayes and three
nights in the whales bellie: ſo the ſonne of man muſt be three
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:178019:55"/>
dayes and three nights in the heart of the earth.</hi> Indeede, if
the rule of nature were contrarie to this ſaying of
Chriſt, I ſhoulde ſooner yeelde, that nature might
erre, then the Lord of nature lie. But Chriſt came
neither to deſtroy the lawe giuen to his church, nor
to the reſt of his creatures, called the law of nature.
Wherefore, this anſwere was not Doctor-like. If you
had looked well about you, you might haue ſeene,
that his beeing three daies, and three nights in the
heart of the earth, pertaineth to his buriall, and not
to his deſcending, more then his ryſing again out of
the hart of the earth, pertaineth to his aſcenſion. For
theſe are foure diſtinct things. His deſcending from
heauen into his humane ſtate: his burial, and laying
vp in the heart of the earth after his death: his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
and returning againe from the heart of the
earth into the ſtate he was ſeparated from by death.
his aſcending from the earth vp into heauen. I drew
alſo another reaſon from the firſt principle, to preve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
an anſwere, that his deſcending might haue beene
firſt from heauen into his humane ſtate, and then out
of his humane ſtate into hell. It was this: if Chriſts
deſcending from heauen did end in Hell, then it culd
not bee one motion, being ſo manie yeares intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
But it was but one motion: <hi>Ergo,</hi> it ended not in
Hell. To this you anſwere, that I, who charge you
with cloudes of Sophiſtrie, do raiſe ſuch miſtes of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtications,
that you cannot ſee in them, what I
mean by this one motion. But there is not the cauſe.
That the Owle ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not ſee in the light, the fault is not
in the light, but in the eie of the owle. There is not a
gnerall in Oxenford, that had ſpent a moneth in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<hi>Ariſtotles</hi> 5. and 6. bookes <hi>de natura,</hi> that would
not haue knowne this argument. One deſcending, is
but one motion. Paule ſpeaketh heere but of one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion:
<hi>Ergo,</hi> but of one motion. Your degrees of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:178019:55"/>
humiliation, are heere impertinent. Howe properlie
they are diſtinguiſhed, I referre it to the margent.
You tell mee in the beginning, that my firſt reaſon
was from the place of Iohn, <hi>I came from my Father in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the worlde,</hi> &amp;c. Now ſillie man, I pitie your ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
That is no reaſon at all. But ſeeing I was to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
naturall reaſon to this text: I brought that place
to proue, that I made no private ſens of theſe words,
Which courſe, if you would follow, your wrangling
would ſoone weare to an end. But you ſay, that that
place doeth little or nothing pertaine to this place,
that heere wee haue in hand. A fig is not liker a fig
then that is like this. That hee deſcended, and that
he came from the Father: that he aſcended, and that
hee went to his Father are ſo like, that though you
put on your ſpectacles, you will not finde a haire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
them. The argument that you frame heere
for mee, and the two abſurd ſimilies framed on the
ſame block, let them bee buried in the brain, that
bred them. That is the fitteſt coffen, I know, for ſuch
rotten ſtuffe. Wherefore, to conclude this diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
about theſe wordes, ſeeing neither your exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples

            <p>YOur next argument is taken from the wordes of

whole man Chriſt was not in heauen, <hi>Ergo,</hi> his ſoule
was not there. That theſe wordes of Chriſt were
meant of the whole, it is apparant by the text. For,
that which had not yet been with his Father, was the
ſame that <hi>Marie</hi> was forbid to touch. That I beleeue
you will not ſay, was his ſoule, which is not ſubject
to feeling, but the whole man conſiſting of ſoule &amp;

my ſchoole-points, which in you I called Sophiſtrie.
The true maximes and rules of art, ſucked out of the
marrowes of nature, I neuer called Sophiſtrie in you
nor no man elſe. Your ſhrimpiſh reaſons, ſet out in
the painted coates of blaſed words, and confidentlie
commended to the beholders, without al bounds of
modeſtie: I haue called them, what I haue called
them, and not ſo ill, as they deſerue. My rule which
you ſay were ſophiſtrie, if you vſed it, as I doe, you
confeſſe it to be true in integrall parts. Nowe ſay I,
the ſoule and the bodie be integrall parts of a man:<note place="margin">Heer I follow Ramus.</note>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> by your owne confeſsion, my rule is true of the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:178019:58"/>
ſoule and the bodie. But if you had taken my max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime
right, you ſhould haue found it hold in all parts
whatſoeuer. For I meant that a particular negatiue
of the whole, is not good to bring in a negatiue of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
particular part. All <hi>Campion</hi> hangeth, not ouer
New-gate, importeth that ſome part of him, ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth
there. And all men bee not in England, importeth
that there be ſome men there: which bee particular
negatiues, expreſſed in generall tearmes, as <hi>non omris</hi>
and <hi>nonnullns</hi> bee in Latine. Thus much for the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere,
that you deale with. You left another anſwere
which I will heere ſet againſt your argument in his
beſt liuery. If the man is ſaid to be (ſay you) wher the
ſoule is, then where the man is not, the ſoule is not:
But the man is ſaide to bee, where the ſoule is: <hi>Ergo,</hi>
where the man is not, the ſoule is not. Firſt, (ſay I)
the <hi>maior</hi> is not true. For though the man may bee
ſaid to bee where the ſoule is, by a <hi>Synecdoche:</hi> yet it
will not follow, that where the man is not, the ſoule
is not. Becauſe this ſpeach is ſimple, and that is figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiue.
In a good argument, the wordes muſt carie
one face, not heere one, and there another. To ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amplifie
this with your owne examples out of Math
8. Manie ſhall reſt with Abraham, Iſaac, and Iacob,
in the kingdome of heauen. Abraham, Iſaac, and Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob
are ſaid to be in heauen by a figure, becaus their
ſoules are there. But if you will take the words ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie,
and conclude; becauſe Abraham (that is the
whole man) is not in heauen: therefore his ſoule
is not there: euerie carter will finde the abſurditie of
your fallacie. This for my firſt reply. Now I add that
you flee from the wordes of the text. For Chriſt ſaid
not to <hi>Marie,</hi> I haue not beene with my Father, but
I am not yet aſcended to my Father: which wordes
will admit no forme to carie your concluſion, turne
them, and winde them as you liſt. For the Scripture
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:178019:59"/>
denieth in plaine words, that the name of aſcenſion
can be giuen to the ſoule. I hope you will grant that
Dauids ſoule is in heauen: and yet of him it is ſaide,
Act. 2. 34. David is not aſcended. This wypeth alſo
away, your other objection of two aſcenſions. For,
that name was neuer yet giuen to a man, in reſpect
of the ſoule. And therefore, I will haue the goale,
though you ſtand in it. You wring out of my exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of the whole race of mankind, &amp; <hi>Campions</hi> bodie,
two abſurdities. The one, that I hold no greater vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
betweene Chriſts ſoule, and his bodie, then al the
men in the world. The other, that I holde the ſoule
of Chriſt, to bee mortall: becauſe I compare it to an
integral part of <hi>Campions</hi> body. Why M. Doctor, haue
you (now you are Doctored) forgot the olde ſpeach
of the Schooles, when you were a generall? <hi>Quae com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parantur
in vno, non comparantur in omnibus?</hi> Things co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
in one thing, are not like in all things. You
may bee like your Father, and yet perhappes your
Father coulde not wrangle in this matter, like your
ſelfe. And the Cuckow ſingeth onelie in the ſpring,
like the Nightingall, though in melodie and variety
of notes, there bee no likelie-hood at all. An argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
taken indefinitly from the manhood of Chriſt
to his ſoule and his bodie, parts thereof: is no better
then from the race of mankinde, to euerie particular
man, or from the bodie of the traitour <hi>Campion,</hi> to
the parts thereof. And yet if you regarde the vnion
of the ſoule &amp; body, or the immortality of the ſoule:
there is no more compariſon, then betweene your
ſpirit and your Fathers, if it was righter, or the Cuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kowes
ſong and the Nightingals beeing far ſweeter.
Laſtlie, you tel mee, that I vtter a great error in theſe
wordes: the whole man Chriſt. Indeede, if I had ſaid
man the whole Chriſt, I had perchance opened my
head to this venew. But now I am faſter locked, then
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:178019:59"/>
that you can faſten anie blowes vpon mee, with the
beſt weapons in your armorie. For ſeeing the worde
of truth, doeth call Chriſt a man ſo manie times: I
am perſwaded, it wil not proue ſo foule an errour to
cal the whole man Chriſt, except you can proue that
ſome part of him was Chriſt, and not the whole. The
teſtimonie of <hi>Athanaſius</hi> to confute this errour,
toucheth not mee. The concluſion out of <hi>Irenaeus</hi>
(though it might haue a favourable conſtruction) I
leaue it amongſt the judgements of men, which you

Heere <hi>Beza</hi> whome we follow (becauſe he commeth
neareſt to the true ſenſe of the Apoſtle) by this word
Spirit, doth giue vs to vnderſtand the Deity of Chriſt
following Iohn who called God a Spirit: and by this
word (fleſh) his ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>hood: containing both his body
and ſoule, as hee findeth it vſed of Paule: God was
made manifeſt in the fleſhe. Which <hi>Antitheſis</hi> of the

in the ſame wordes, which was made of the ſeede of
Dauid according to the fleſhe: and declared mighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
to bee the ſonne of God, according to the Spirit.
Where you ſee, that he vſeth the words no otherwiſe

To this I anſwere: that it is ſpoken of the ſame ſpirit
in the 18. of Gen. I will go downe and ſee, whether
the Sodomites haue done according to the crie that
is come vnto mee. And in Exod. 3. I am come to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer
them out of the hands of the Aegyptians. You
can not bee ignorant M. Hill: that the ſpirit of God
ſpeketh ſo manie times of the Deity by a figure, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Anthropopatheia,</hi> when God doth declare his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
in one place more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in another, by ſome no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
effect. Which in this place was moſt neceſſary,
to note vnto vs the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinual preſence of Chriſt in his
church, departing (as it were) from all other places
(which indeede hee cannot) and ſitting in it, as it
were a continual ruler and moderator therof. Next,
you alledge the other participle, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (that is,
quickened) that becauſe it is a paſsiue, it can not
ſtand with the Deitie, which cannot ſuffer at al. This
we denie not. For we attribute not this participle to
the Deitie, but to the whole Chriſt, God and man.
Neither doth the text ſay, that the ſpirit was quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
but that Chriſt was quickened in the Spirit.
Thirdlie, you tel mee that mortified and quickened
are contraries, &amp; both attributed to Chriſt at once,
to note vnto vs, that he was both dead and aliue at
one inſtant. Heere we confeſſe, that they be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to one Chriſt: but why they ſhold be referred to
one time, wee ſee no reaſon to induce vs to think it.
To this end you ad, that the Apoſtle doth ſhewe vs
how he was dead, and how he was aliue, by adding
dead fleſh, and quickened ſpirit. The verie text (as I
take it) will denie you this: for it hath not, that the
ſpirit was quickened, and the fleſhe killed: but that
Chriſt was killed in the fleſhe, and quickened in the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:178019:60"/>
ſpirit: which is all one, as if he had ſaid, that the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
death as he was man, and ouercame death as
he was God. And this Paull doeth ſpeake in other
wordes, that he was crucified in his infirmities: yet
liveth he through the power of God. Fourthlie, you
ſay that the Scripture doeth joine this his going and
preaching, cloſe to his paſsion: As if it had ſaid: As
ſoon as he had ſuffered, he went and preached. This
(as if) includeth no neceſſarie matter. We expect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration,
and wil not be caried with (as) and (if)
Fiftlie, you argue out of the 6. of Geneſis, that the
preaching of <hi>Noah,</hi> is attributed to the third perſon
of the Deitie, and not to the ſecond. The wordes be
theſe, My Spirit ſhall not alwaies ſtriue with man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he is but fleſh. Which wordes fewe (or rather)
no interpreters, that euer I ſaw, expound as you doe
of the third perſon of the Deitie. <hi>Tremelius</hi> and <hi>Iuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ns,</hi>
whoſe great panies, learning, and judgement, all
ſinceare hearts do reuerence, expound them thus. I
will not long diſpute with my ſelf (ſaieth the Lorde)
what to doe with theſe men: for my ſentence ſhall
ſtand, that except they ſpedelie repent, I wil deſtroy
them. Neither maketh it much againſt vs, though it
were as you would haue it. For, ſeeing the actions of
the Deitie are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to all the three perſons, he er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
not that giueth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to any of the three. So doth
the ſcripturs in many places attribute the reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of Chriſt, ſometimes to the Father, ſomtimes to the
ſonne, and ſometimes to the Spirit of ſanctification.
And Chriſt himſelfe telleth vs, that whatſoeuer the
Father doth, the ſame he doeth alſo. After this you
object that <gap reason="foreign">

ſome-time, doth ſeparate the time of their diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,

in minde, that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">

is, went diſobedient &amp; preached, be all of one tenſe
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:178019:61"/>
in the Greeke, and muſt needes be referred to one
time, ſo that hee went, and preached to them euen
then, when they were diſobedient. And this the word
(diſobedient) doth confirme. For, to whome I pray
you, were they diſobedient? but to the ſpirit that
preached to them. As for the adverbe (ſometime)
it is not ſet heere to ſeparate words of one time: but
to diſtinguiſh the time of their inpriſonment, which
was preſent, from the daies of their rebellion, which
was paſt in the dayes of <hi>Noah,</hi> when the long patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
of the Lord, exſpected their amendement. Whereas
you argue, that this cannot bee ſpoken of <hi>Noah</hi> his
preaching, becauſe he preached to men, and not to
Spirits: I am perſwaded that no man can preache to
men, and not to their Spirites: becauſe hee that tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
a man, inſtructeth his Spirit, which is his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
ſoule. And yet heere you may marke (if it
pleaſe you) that there be two things heere ſpoken of,
preching &amp; priſon: the on pertayning to theſe ſpirits
when they were men with ſpirits: the other now, that
they are onelie ſpirits: and that therfore the Apoſtle
did diſcreetlie chooſe the name ſpirit, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to both theſe tymes. Laſtlie, you charge this
conſtruction with viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: for that we take the word
(ſpirit) in one place, for the Deitie of Chriſt, and
ſtreight way againe, for the ſpirits of men in priſon.
I hope you will not denie, but that the word is vſuall
in both ſignifications, &amp; that it is no wrong, to giue
words their own ſignifications, when the drifts and
circumſtances of the place doth requyre them. Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto,
I haue dealt with your objections againſt <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za.</hi>
Nowe I will proue with vnfallible reaſons, that
your ſenſe, cannot ſtand with this text. You take the
word (fleſh) onlie for the bodie of Chriſt, which died
and was buried: and the word (ſpirit) for his humane
ſoule, which you beare vs in hand, did deſcend into
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:178019:61"/>
hell, and did preach there to the ſoules that had ben
diſobedient, and rebellious in the dayes of <hi>Noab.</hi> If
this your conceit ſhall go for current: that which the
Apoſtle ſpeaketh heere of Chriſt, may be verified as
well of anie other man. For when we die, our ſoules
die no more then his did. But let vs look a little nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
the matter. The ſpirit heere, (as it appeareth by
the text) doeth ſignifie that which gaue life to that
that was dead. That (I truſt) was not his humane
ſoule, but his deuine and heauenlie ſpirit. Thirdlie,
in this Participle (mortified) is compriſed death,
which giuen to Chriſt, is neuer taken in al the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
for the temporal death of his bodie onlie: but
whatſoeuer Chriſt ſuffered, either in ſoule or bodie,
for the redemption of our ſoules and our bodies, &amp;
doth compryſe his whole paſsion. Which, (if it bee
true) then the word (fleſh) muſt be the whole ſubject
of all this paſsion: that is, both his ſoule and body,
or the whole man Chriſt. For hee ſuffered as well in
ſoule for our ſoules, as in bodie for our bodies, or
elſe he had beene but half a Redeemer. Fourthlie,
ſeeing his bodie was quickned, that is, reſtored from
the graue, as well as his ſoule from hell: If you take
(ſpirit) heer for his humane ſoule: then ſhal you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
thoſe things, that the Apoſtle doth diſtinguiſh
attributing that to the ſoule alone, which is commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
both to the ſoule and the bodie. Fiftlie, ſeing (quik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned)
is to receaue life, either which it neuer had, or
els had loſt: the ſoule cannot be ſaid to be quickned
becauſe, it neuer loſt life, after that it once liued
with the bodie. Heere you tell vs, that quickened is
to be deliuered from miſeries and ſorrowes. Howe
the Engliſh word may be taken, I leaue it to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
of the diſcreete and indifferent reader: But
ſure I am, it will proue a hard thing to finde that ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification,
either in the Latine word <hi>viuificari,</hi> or the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:178019:62"/>
greeke word <hi>Zoopoteiſthas,</hi> which bee ſo mixed with
life, that if they ſignifie deliuerie from miſeries, then
life it ſelf muſt ſignifie miſeries and ſorrowes, which,
(though they follow on it) are neuer ſignified by it.
If this deuiſe may ſtand, you wil ouerthrow the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titheſis</hi>
betweene dead and quickened. For, if quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
doth not ſignifie a reſtitution to life, what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety
hath it with mortefied or dead, which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
the extinguiſhing of life. Sixtlie, (ſpirit) doeth
heere ſignifie that, which was free from death, and
the violence of his enemies: This (I hope) you will
not ſay, was his humane ſoule, wherein hee ſuffered
the death of the ſoule: that is, the torments of Hell,
as well as in bodie, the death of the bodie. Seuinth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
the ſoule of Chriſt could not preach, beeing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute
of a tongue, mouth, and other organes of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsitie
required in that action. Eightlie, to what
end ſhuld Chriſt preach to thoſe damned ſoules, who
were paſt the frute of his preaching? that which you
ſay, that he went to reproue them, is not liklie. For
me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are reproued, either for amendement, or to take
away excuſes, which to theſe was needleſſe, beeing
paſt all remedie, and excuſe. Ninthlie, this prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
was then, when their diſ-obedience was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form-able,
which was in the dayes of <hi>Noah,</hi> and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
ſince. Add to theſe (if it pleaſe you,) that moſte

you wil not ſay, Chriſt was put to deth in<note n="467" place="margin">But I will ſay he ſuffered death in ſoule and bodie.</note> ſoul &amp;
body, but in body only. And wher you ſay, that Chriſt
ſuffered in ſoule aſwell as in body, that is true, &amp; that
is gathered<note n="468" place="margin">But why not?</note> not of <hi>thanatotheis</hi> y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> is killed, but

Moreouer, as you referre mee to reade <hi>Bezas</hi> greate
notes one this text, ſo I pray you to reade <hi>Aretius</hi>
handling this place, whoſe words ar theſe. Generally
(ſayth <hi>Aretius) Pet.</hi> repeateth three effectes of Chriſts
death, if you marke it wel. The firſt pertaineth to the
damned, The ſecond to the elect. The third the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of Chriſt. The firſt was declared in his deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in to hell. The ſecond in his reſurrection. The
third in his aſcention into heauen. This is the true
and naturall meaning of this place which wee will
follow, leauing the intrications of other interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
I willinglye confeſſe this place is very hard, for
<hi>Auguſtine</hi> doubteth of it, &amp; <hi>Luther</hi> douteth of it how
it is to bee vnderſtoode; but this obſcurity aryſeth
not of the place, but of the varietie of interpretations,
If thou marke the plainneſſe of the place, the matter
will be eaſye, but that pleaſeth not all men: therefore
that euery on may eſtabliſh his owne ſence, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the words of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> to their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit.
But leauing theſe, let vs imbrace that which the
words do teach vs: in the which, if we attaine to the
truth, it is well: if not, yet they ſhall bee probable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they haue warrant out of the ſcriptures, and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:178019:67"/>
leane to the very letter <hi>to reto,</hi> otherwiſe it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
the knowledge of man to be vnperfect in many
queſtions of holie ſcripture, of the which the Apoſtle
doth warne vs, 1. <hi>Corin. 15. For now wee knowe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectlie.</hi>
I haue ſayd here is declared three effects
of Chriſts death which differ in time, &amp; are ſet in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in the Creede. The firſt effect is, that Chriſt being
dead, denounced eternal paines to the wicked in hell.
The words of the Apoſtle are theſe. <hi>In which ſpirite
he went and preached to the ſpirits detained in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi>
I take the place ſimply of the deſcence into hell,
for ſo the words do plainly ſound, and I ſee al the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
ſo to interpret them: <hi>Auguſtine Epiſt.</hi> 99. and
<hi>Ciprian</hi> doth manifeſtly interpret this place of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending
into Hel. Neither doth the word priſon hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
this Interpretation: which in the <hi>Apocal.</hi> 20. 5. is
taken for hel. <hi>When a thouſand yeers ſhal be fulfilled,
Satan ſhall be loſed out of his priſon.</hi> Therefore, the
priſon that <hi>Peter</hi> heere ſpeaketh of, is the place depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the damned. Hyther came Chriſt, as we confes

y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> wicked, that the mirit of his death did nothing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

craue an inſtance (if I can) in all the Scripture. Howe
one word in one period can carie two ſignifications

hole in my hoſe! Now, I feare nothing, but that you
craued an inſtance out of the olde Teſtament.</p>
               <p>The third was, If death, whenſoeuer it is attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to Chriſt in the Scriptures,<note place="margin">3. Reaſon.</note> compriſeth the whole
paſsion, the fleſhe in this text, muſt be the ſubject of

Chriſt. But deth is neuer attributed to chriſt, but for
the whol paſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. <hi>Ergo,</hi> fleſh muſt be the ſubject of the
paſsion, that is, the whole manhood of Chriſt. Heer
you denie the <hi>minor,</hi> and like a skilfull Logician, giue
inſtance in the queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. If you haue not forgot your
olde logicke, the argument, and the thing argued
ſhould not be one. You ſupplie the imperfection of
this anſwere, with two arguments <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
that death in this place cannot ſignifie the
paſsion. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
Your firſt reſon is, that
the paſsion is mentioned before in the word ſuffred,
Be it ſo: Yet it may bee repeated in more ſpeciall
tearmes. By your reaſon, in the beleef, where a repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
is leſſe tollerable, crucified and died, belong
not to the paſsion; becauſe they are expreſſed before
in the word ſuffered. Suffering, which may be in tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing,
whipping, and impriſonment, is too ſlacke
a tearme, to expreſſe the helliſh tormentes of Chriſts
paſsion. The other is, if (mortified) pertaine to the
ſoule, and bodie, it will followe, that the ſoule is alſo
mortall. You tell mee out of <hi>Athanaſius</hi> in the reply
to my fift ſection, that by the double puniſhment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
on Adam, the ſoule ſhould die the death. And
I heard you preach in our Ladie Church at <hi>Sarum.</hi>
That when it was ſaide to Adam, thou ſhalt die the
death, the meaning was, he ſhould die the death of
ſoule and bodie. Now, if you wil apply theſe two ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications
of death to Chriſt: the one to the bodie,
and the other to the ſoule: I hope this objection wil
neither ſcratch nor byte.</p>
               <p>My fourth reaſon was this. In this: <hi>Antitheſis</hi> mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
in the fleſh, and quickened in the ſpirite: mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:178019:69" rendition="simple:additions"/>
belongeth not to the ſpirit, nor quickened to
the fleſhe: but mortified belongs to the ſoule, for it
died the death of the ſoule, and quickened to the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> for it receaued life againe. <hi>Ergo,</hi> fleſh is not the
bodie onlie, and ſpirit the humane ſoule. To this you
anſwere, that Chriſt was raiſed from the dead, and
that was ſignified in the word reſurrection, verſ. 21.
and therefore you do not confound theſe diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
things, antitheticallie oppoſed. But wee, that
make mort<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ed, &amp; ſuffered; quickned &amp; reſurrection
all one. How this may anſwere mee, I leaue it to the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ead that bred it to explane. But you do vs wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, we
make not mortified, &amp; ſuffered one, &amp;c. Suffered and
quickned ar tearms more general, mortified &amp; raiſed
againe more ſpeciall: expreſsing things more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
and particularie, which were touched before
more covert<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> and generallie.</p>
               <p>My fift reaſon was. To be quickened is to receaue
life,<note place="margin">5. Reaſon.</note> which the thing that is quickened either neuer
had, or els had loſte. But the ſoule had life in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
and neuer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> after: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the ſoule cannot bee
quickened. To this you anſwere nothing: but tell vs
by the ſame reaſon,<note place="margin">Anſwere.</note> it can much leſſe pertaine to the
Deitie. Thus, thinking to wound vs with our owne
weapon, you ſtrike ſhort, and with the back, drawe
blood at your owne brow. I told you in my anſwere
to your ſecond objection, that quickened is not heer
attributed to the Deitie, but to the whole Chriſt, by
the participatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of proprieties. How can you excuſe
your ſelf heere of wilfull falſification? But you mend
the matter, with a more ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t anſwere out of Ioh.
That the ſoule of the beleeuer liueth, though hee
were dead. What then? Iohn telleth not your tale,
that the ſoule of the beleeuer, is quickened when hee
is dead: That it liueth, is not the queſtion. The bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
of the bodie, which you alledge out of the book
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:178019:70"/>
of Wiſd. loadeth the ſoule, but killeth it not. And
therfore, when it is deliuered of that load, it is not
quickened, but releeued. And the renewing of the
inward man, which you alleadge from Paule, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
not the ſoule, being dead: but addeth courage
and comfort, to the living and languiſhing ſoule by
Gods promiſes. Heere I ſee you are quite thruſt fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
your hold at Chippenham, that to bee quickned is,
to bee deliuered from miſeries. Ingenuitie woulde
haue confeſſed a fault. You conclude with a confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of the <hi>Antitheſis,</hi> between the divinity &amp; huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity:
but my reaſon is fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an <hi>Antitheſis</hi> between mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
&amp; quickned, fleſh &amp; ſpirit: which you (by a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
gloſe) taking quickned for a deliuerie fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
did ouerthrow. Yet becauſe I ſaid that Paul ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
that <hi>antitheſis,</hi> Rom. 1. It ſhal not be impertine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
to view your reaſons. An <hi>Antitheſis</hi> muſt be (ſay you)
of things oppoſite and contrarie. I add, the Diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and humanitie bee thinges oppoſite: <hi>Ergo,</hi> there
may be an <hi>Antitheſis</hi> of the Diuinity, and the huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.
But they are vnited, ſay you. What then? So
be the fleſh, and the ſpirit; and yet Chriſt ſaieth, the
Spirit is readie, but the fleſhe is weake. A common
Logician,<note place="margin">Mat. 26. 41.</note> (much more a Doctor) ſhould know, that
no vniting of thinges, betweene which a difference
may be obſerued, can let an <hi>Antitheſis,</hi> if occaſion
ſerue. Notwithſtanding the vniting, a man may wel
ſay, Chriſt as hee was man, was paſsible, as hee was
God, he was impaſsible.</p>
               <p>To theſe reaſons, I added more in my latine which
I ſent you. The ſpirit heere doth ſignifie that, which
his enemies,<note place="margin">6. Reaſon.</note> (hell &amp; death,) could not touch: accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the text, he was quickened in the ſpirit. But
his humane ſoule eſcaped not the violence of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies:
<hi>Ergo,</hi> the word (ſpirit) heere doth not ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
his humane ſoule. To this you make no anſwere.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:178019:70"/>
The ſeaventh was.<note place="margin">7. Reaſon.</note> This ſpirit of which he ſpeaketh
heere, did preach: But the humane ſoule cannot
preach: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the ſpirit heere, is not the humane
ſoule. To this you anſwere, that he preached not vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>callie,
but reallie,<note place="margin">Anſwere. Reply.</note> that is, not in words but in deeds.
A dumb man may preach ſo, as well as D. Hill. If
you ſtand 7. dayes in the pulpit of the great Church
at Sarum, and ſay nothing: there bee not 7. men
within 700. myles, that wil commend your ſermon.</p>
               <p>The eight was.<note place="margin">8. Reaſon.</note> Whoſoeuer doth preach, he doth
it either to amend the enormities of the hearers: or
to inſtruct them in the waye of ſaluation. But this
was not to be hoped for in damned ſpirits: <hi>Ergo,</hi> hee
preached not in Hell,<note place="margin">Anſwere Reply.</note> to damned ſpirits. Heere you
anſwere, that he preached to reproue them of their
infidelitie: but you fall ſtill in one ditch. He that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proueth
infidelitie, doeth it either to mend it, or to
take away excuſes: But there was no ſuch hope in
theſe, that were paſt all remedie and excuſe.</p>
               <p>The ninth was. This preaching was, when the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience
of the hearers,<note place="margin">9. Reaſon</note> was reforme-able. But
this was onelie reforme-able in the dayes of Noah:
<hi>Ergo,</hi> this preaching was not, but in the daies of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah.
This hath no anſwere.</p>
               <p>The tenth was from the circumſtances of the text

As if the Hebrewe tongue,<note place="margin">Rejoynder</note> which is called <hi>lingua ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta,</hi>
were fitter to ſpeak improperly of God, then the
Greeke, or that <hi>poreueſthai,</hi> had gotten ſome ſpeciall
licence, more then anie other verbs of motion, to be
free from that figure. Yet if it will pleaſe you to read
Exod. 13. 2. Nomb. 14. 14. Deut. 1. 33. Exod. 33. 3.
Pſal. 132. 8. Deut. 31. 3. Pſal. 71. 12. Pſal. 88. 7. and
infinite ſuch places more, you ſhall find that plakket
deere of a naked q. without a cap. But ſuppoſe that
I could not finde it attributed to the Deitie in all
theſe Scriptures, yet you were not the nearer your
marke. For, if you bee remembred, your reaſon was
in Chippenham, that <hi>poreueſthai</hi> cannot bee giuen to
the Deitie, becauſe it is a verb of motion. Now, the
<hi>maior</hi> of your ſyllogiſm muſt be, that no verb of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
can bee attributed to the Deitie. Which <hi>maior</hi>
being craſed by my firſt anſwere, and the examples
there alledged. There is no reaſon left you, why <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reueſthai</hi>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:178019:71"/>
cannot be attributed to the Deitie, as wel as
<hi>ercheſthai,</hi> or <hi>katabainein:</hi> and no reaſon you knowe, is
too weake againſt ten ſuch ſtout reaſons, as I haue
ſent you, forcing this ſenſe vpon this place.</p>
               <p>Your next argument,<note place="margin">2. Objection.</note> was from the participle
(quickned) thus. No paſsiue can agree with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itie:
Quickned is a paſsiue: <hi>Ergo,</hi> it cannot agree
with the Deitie. This ſyllogiſm I granted to be good
and told you withall,<note place="margin">Anſwere.</note> that wee doe not attribute this
Participle to the Deitie, but to the whole Chriſt, by
participation of proprieties, following the text
which ſaith not, that the fleſh was mortified, and the

fleſh, and quickened in the ſpirite. This anſwere, you
ſtroke off your skore.</p>
               <p>Your third argument was from the tenſe or time
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>
bee attributed to Chriſt at one time,<note place="margin">3. Object.</note> they note, that
hee was deade and aliue at one time. But the firſt is
true: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the laſt is true. To this I anſwere, denying
the <hi>maior,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Anſwere.</note> That participles or verbs of one time at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to one thing, muſte needes pertaine to one
time. In the beleef, wee ſay, that Chriſt was crucified,
dead, and buried: where crucified, dead, &amp; buried, be
all of one tenſe or time, &amp; yet agree not all to Chriſt
at one inſtance of time. To this you reply, that they
muſte pertaine to one time, and proue your <hi>maior</hi>
thus. Chriſt was after his paſsion dead or aliue at on
time, or elſe neuer. If he were neuer dead and aliue at
one time, S. Peter ſpeaketh not trulie. If hee were
dead and aliue at one time, then I ſpeake falſelie. In
this Syllogiſme is neither mood nor figure: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
that, it ſtandeth on a begging of the queſtion,
That Peter ſaieth hee was at one time deade and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue,
is the queſtion, and you take that, as if it were

Your fourth reaſon was.<note place="margin">4. Objection.</note> If Peter ſaith, that the fleſh
was dead, and the Spirit quickened, then doeth hee
ſhew, that he was both dead and aliue at one time.
But the firſt is true: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the laſt is not falſe. The <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi>
of this Syllogiſme,<note place="margin">Anſwere.</note> I did denie: ſhewing, that it is
flat againſt the text, which ſaieth not, that the fleſhe
was dead, and the ſpirit quickened. But that Chriſt
was dead in the fleſh,<note place="margin">No reply, no Rejoynder.</note> and quickned in the ſpirit. This
reaſon it pleaſeth you of your courteſie to ſend away
in ſecrete, without a God be with you.</p>
               <p>Your fifth reaſon was.<note place="margin">5. Objection.</note> The Scripture doth join this
going &amp; preaching cloaſe to his paſsion, as if it wold

nowe I am determined (except they repent) to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
them at the day appointed. Notwithſtanding,
granting you that it were as you would haue it, I
tolde you, ſeeing the actions of euery perſon of the

giueth them to anie of the three.<note place="margin">Reply.</note> This you confeſſe
to be true. But you ask me, if I can proue that Chriſt
preached in Noah after his paſsion: affirming con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidentlie,
that this was attributed to him of Peter, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the paſsion.<note place="margin">Rejoynder.</note> It were requiſite that you had good
proof according to the waight of this caſe, and your
confidence in ſpeaking it. But I will eaſe you of that
burden. Proue it out of the text, with anie reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
ſhew of truth, and you ſhall haue my hart and
hand. The order of the wordes which you ſtand ſo
ſtoutlie vpon, is not ſo ſtrict, as you would haue it.
For the purpoſe and drift of the Apoſtle heere, is to
perſwade vs to patience by the example of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
and not to ſet out his death, deſcending and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,
in order as they were done: but <hi>obiter</hi> as
they fall in hand, and followe the matter that heere
he driveth to perſwade.</p>
               <p>Your ſeauenth reaſon was,<note place="margin">7. Objection.</note> if Chriſt was raiſed
from the dead, by the firſt perſon of the Deitie, and
not by the ſecond: then the word ſpirit heere, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not

the firſt perſon,<note place="margin">Anſwere</note> and not by the ſecond. <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c. I
might well haue tolde you, that this <hi>minor</hi> is abſurde
and flat againſt the plaine text, Ioh. 5. 21. Whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
thing the Father doth, the ſame the ſonne doeth
alſo with him. And Ioh. 10. 18. which wordes I did
quote not farre before, in the defence of my ſecond
reaſon. I haue power to lay downe my life, and I
haue power to take it vp again. But then ſparing you
and refraining all hard ſpeeches, how euer they were
due, I onelie tolde you; that I ſawe not howe that
could ſtand with the trueth of the Scriptures, which
telleth mee,<note place="margin">Reply Rejoynder.</note> that the ſecond perſon did put on man,
and did not forſake him in all his diſtreſſes. You re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
in the margent of your written copy, ſee contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
to this Act, 4. 40: Act. 13. 30. 1. Cor. 15. 15. Which
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:178019:73"/>
places I haue marked &amp; obſerued, to make nothing
againſt my aſſertion. In them the raiſing vp of chriſt,
is attributed to the God-head, which worketh not
(as I haue noted alreadie) one perſon without an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.
Which thing, if it bee an errour, it was Iohn
that ſeduced mee. cap. 5. 7. The Father worketh, and
I work. As the Father doth raiſe vp the deade, ſo the
ſonne likewiſe, doth raiſe vp whome he will. And in
the 17. verſe, quoted a little aboue. The ſame is agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to other infinite places of Scripture, and the
ſomme of our Faith, called the beleef, which ſaieth;
the third day hee roſe againe, and not that hee was

               <p>Your eight reaſon was.<note place="margin">8. Objection.</note> If the time that they were
preached to, and of their diſobedience, was not one:
then this preaching is not to bee vnderſtood of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah
his preaching, in the time of their diſobedience.
But the adverbe <hi>pote</hi> doth diſtinguiſh thoſe times.<note place="margin">Anſwere</note> 
                  <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi>
&amp;c. To this I anſwere, that the Adverb <hi>pote,</hi> doth
not determine the participle <hi>apeitheſaſi,</hi> but the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
verbe <hi>ekeryxen,</hi> You replie, that I ſpeak neither
like a Divine,<note place="margin">Reply.</note> nor like a Grammarian. To proue me
no divine, which indeede I am not: and no Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marian,
which I am but little: you alledge no Diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and little grammer. It will not followe, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it may ſtand with a Participle, therefore it is ſo
heere: or, that becauſe it is diſtinguiſhed from the
verb, with a <hi>comma,</hi> therefore it cannot determine it
at all. You are not ouer-loden with Grammar, if
you knowe not,<note place="margin">Rejoynder</note> that diuerſe and manie reaſons, may

And as for this place, <hi>pote,</hi> if it did depend (as
you would haue it) vpon <hi>apeitheſaſi,</hi> it cannot bee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed
from <hi>ekeryxen</hi> with a <hi>comma,</hi> ſeing <hi>apeithe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſi</hi>
it ſelf, is gouerned of <hi>ekeryxen,</hi> without commix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of anie interjected member to parte them. What
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:178019:73"/>
euer your book hath, take heed, that it be not a ſtain
to your skill in grammar, to credite a book in ſuch a
caſe.</p>
               <p>Your ninth argument was. Noah preched to men
Theſe were ſpirits &amp; not men: <hi>Ergo,</hi> Noah preached
not to theſe. I anſwered, that whoſoeuer preacheth
to men, preacheth to ſpirites, becauſe no men want
ſpirits, that is, reaſonable ſoules. And now I ad, that
they are heer called Spirits, in reſpect of their impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment,
not in reſpect of his preaching. If hee had
called them men, then the name of priſon wherein
they are now datained, had beene improper. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
wiſelie chooſed that worde, which might beſt
agree with both thoſe times. <hi>Bezaes</hi> opinion alſo,
whereto <hi>Andradius</hi> the Papiſt agreeth, is moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
that <hi>pote</hi> doth determine the ſame Participle
<hi>apeitheſaſi,</hi> and doeth diſtinguiſh it from <hi>tois en phylake
pneumaſi,</hi> which muſt needs be vnderſtood in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
time, by vertue of the participle <hi>ouſi,</hi> in that kind
of phraſe in Greek, moſt neceſſarily alwaies implyed.
You reply not one worde to the purpoſe: but char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
vs with that we neuer ſpake, nor thought (that
we take theſe ſpirits for the men in Noahs time) you
alleadge Chriſts words againſt vs, Luk. 24. 39. But if
you were a man, that coulde marke the wordes of
them that diſpute againſt you, &amp; take them as they
are ſpoken: you ſhould finde, that wee ſay not that
hee preached to the ſpirites in the dayes of Noah:
But to the ſpirites that nowe are in priſon, and were
diſobedient in the dayes of Noah. If you can anie
waies turne Chriſts wordes in Luke, to confute this,
you neede not to care, what thinges you take vpon
you to proue. If you can proue, that Noah prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
to the men of his time, did not preach to
their Spirites: or that theſe ſpirits in priſon, which
Peter ſpeaketh heer of, were not the ſame that rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:178019:74"/>
in the dayes of Noah, you may driue vs from this
holde: otherwiſe you may throw your cap at vs.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, you charge our conſtruction with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.
I anſwered,<note place="margin">10. Objection.</note> that you do vs wrong, charging vs
with things, that none of vs do ſpeak. Which anſwer
you paſſe by with ſilence,<note place="margin">Anſwere</note> and ſo allow it for currant.</p>
               <p>To theſe you haue added two new ones, which (to

               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">11. Objection.</note> ſay you, if the word <hi>phylake</hi> doth ſignifie hel,
then Chriſt did deſcend into hell: But <hi>phylake</hi> doeth

follow, though <hi>phylake</hi> doeth ſignifie hell (as heere it

you can proue alſo, that <hi>phylake</hi> hath no other ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
then the priſon of vtter darkneſſe, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Your other reaſon is.<note place="margin">12. Objection.</note> He that was killed, dead, and
quickened, did preach. But it was Chriſt that was
killed, dead, and quickned: <hi>Ergo,</hi> it was Chriſt that
preached, and not his Deitie. Chriſt, and not his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itie,
M. Doctor? Can Chriſt preach, and not his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itie?
You may ſay what you will. If I had let fall ſuch
a word, you would haue cried, <hi>Crucifige.</hi> But to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere
you,<note place="margin">Anſwere.</note> I denie the <hi>maior.</hi> It is againſt the text. He
was mortified, that is, killed and dead in the fleſhe,
and that preached not. Hee was quickned in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,
and in that hee went and preached. That which
preached, was neither killed nor dead: neither was it
ſelf quickened: but Chriſt was quickened in it.</p>
               <p>Theſe are all your objections. In my anſwere to
your ſermon, I anſwered 10. of them. You haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
to 6. of them, and to the other 4. you haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen

of the joy. Againe, where I ſay with <hi>Auguſtine,</hi>
that the name of Hell is joined with ſhame, not with
honour: meaning the name of hell is ſhamefull, not
glorious: he takes mee to ſay, that the name of hell
cannot ſtand in a ſentence, with a word of honour, &amp;
quotes againſt mee. 1. Cor. 15, 55. Hell, where is thy
victorie? in which place; hell and victorie, are ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
as if hee had ſaide, Hell thou haſt no victorie.
Thirdlie, whereas I ſay, that Chriſt triumphed by
the power of his Deitie: preſenting his victorie to
heauen, earth and Hell; he giues out that I ſay, that
the Godhead triumphed, and not the humanitie, &amp;
notes in the margent, <hi>Hume</hi> contrarie to Paule and
Peter: and wils mee to reforme this fault in my next
reply. This is M. D. arte: If his cauſe were ſo good, as
he would haue it ſeeme: he needed not this cunning:
or, if he caried as honeſt a minde, as he did proteſt in
Chippenham pulpit: hee would rather performe his
promiſe, then ſeeke ſuch vn-chriſtian-like ſhiftes to
maintaine a bad cauſe.</p>
               <p>Now to anſwere his cavils. I ask you M. Doct. why
you ſend Chriſt to hell, notwithſtanding the three
ends that you had noted, becauſe thoſe endes, were
no endes thereof: and becauſe the Scripture doeth
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:178019:76"/>
teach, that hee had performed all thoſe ends by the
conqueſt of Hel, vpon this croſſe. You brought texts
of Scripture to prooue them, and I anſwered truely,
that not one of them ſoundeth anie ſillable that way.
For, in all thoſe places there is not a letter, neither
of his deſcending into hell, nor of his triumphing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
hell. You replie, that thoſe texts do proue the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
(which is not true of all neither) and that
the reſurrection is a knitting of the ſoule and bodie
together: and that the knitting of them together,
was by bringing his ſoule from Hell (this is your
principle) and his bodie from the graue. Now, add
the concluſion, that hee that proueth Chriſts reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
proueth his deſcending into hell. If this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
bee good, I will yeelde. For, now (if it will holde)
you haue found a way to proue your opinion, by all
the Scriptures. When Chriſt cured the blinde mans
eies with ſpittle, it is plaine, that he was a man: If he
was a man, he was mortall, and died: If hee died, his
ſoule went to hel, (this is your vndoubted principle)
and his bodie to the graue. <hi>Ergo,</hi> he that writes that
Chriſt cured the blinde mans eies with ſpittle, doeth
write that hee went to Hell. By this hooke, you may
pull all the Scriptures out at the window, and make
them proue what pleaſeth you.</p>

               <p>OVr opinion is, that Chriſt vpon the Croſſe, did
offer a perfect ſacrifice for our ſinnes, and finiſh
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:178019:80"/>
the whole worke of our redemption. This we proue
by his owne laſt words, It is finiſhed. For, after the
manner of men, who hauing brought their worke to
the laſt ſtroake, ſay (they haue done) &amp; withall make
an end: Hee hauing borne all the malice that death
and Hell could inflict, told the ſtanders by, that hee
had done. And this hee did immediatlie before hee
gaue vp the ghoſt: becauſe hee could not as hee was
man, tell them the ſame after that he was dead. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wanted this ſpeach great reaſon. It was to make
full our hope, and to confirme our faith, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
might haue ſtood in ſuſpenſe. For, ſeeing
our ſinnes had deſerued, not onelie the temporall
death, which the beholders did ſee him die: but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
all the deathes of Hell, which they, nor no mortal
eie, could ſee him ſuffer: He tolde them himſelf, that
hee had finiſhed and done all, that there might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
no ſcruple for vs to doubt of. Thus therefore
wee reaſon againſt theſe men. If Chriſt finiſhed the
whole worke of our Redemption vpon the croſſe,
there remained nothing for him to do in hel. But he
did finiſhe the whole worke of our redemption vpon
the Croſſe: <hi>Ergo,</hi> there remained nothing for him to
do in hell. This Syllogiſme is ſo ſtrong, that you dare
not denie one ſyllable of it. Wherfore, when I hard
you in the pulpit violate the text wheron it ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth,
I could not chooſe but tell you, that you ranne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
your ſelfe, and made your audience feare, leaſt
you would haue ſent Chriſt to Hell to ſuffer, an error
indeede, but ſuch, as ſome better divines then your
ſelf, that ſealed the truth with their blood, to avoid
the abſurdities of your opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, did fall into in King
Edwards time, when your opinion was moſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallie
embraced, and confirmed by convocation.
Whereas you ſay, that I ſay much and proue little: I
proue as much as I intend. It was not my purpoſe
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:178019:81"/>
to confute anie thing that you had ſpoken trulie. For
theſe words (it is finiſhed) are not to be referred to
the inſtant, when they were ſpoken, but to the end
of his paſsion, which immediatly followed. This you
confeſſe, and why ſhould I confute you? Or which is
ſtranger, howe could you finde a contrarietie in my
wordes, and ſee none in your owne ſpeaking the
ſame, that I doe. But this is amongeſt much more
worſe then this, the frute of your malice. And heer
in your ſermon at Chippenham, there was no more
between vs, but onlie that you made a countenance
to confute that which we avouch, &amp; you confes: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaying
your batterie in ſuch ſorte, that you made the

from mee: for, though you confeſſe that Chriſt
went not to hell to ſuffer: and that he died immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atlie
after he ſaid, (It is finiſhed:) yet you denie, that
this was the end of his worke. Your reaſon is, that
hee had not ſhed his blood, and that without ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of blood, there is no remiſsion of ſinnes. And
may wee beleeue you M. Doctor? That Chriſt was
nailed hands and feet to the croſſe, without ſhedding
of his blood? If you will haue vs ſo credulous as to
thinke this may be true, firſt reſolue vs of what grief
Chriſt died, in not much more, then three of our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

diſtinction of <hi>conſummatumre,</hi> and <hi>conſummatum spe,</hi>
you will needes haue vs beleeue, that it was bred in
Gods booke. You muſt bring better proofe then I
ſee, or elſe it neuer receaued bark nor branch in that
ſoile. The thing that you ſhould proue, is, that the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
of Chriſt was finiſhed in hope, not in deede.
That we are ſaued in hope, Rom. 8. 24. That we wait
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:178019:81"/>
for the hope of our righteouſneſſe. Gal. 5. 5. That
we lift vp our heades, becauſe our redemption draw<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth
neere. Luke. 21. 8. That we ſigh, waiting for the
hope, euen the redemption of our bodies. Rom. 8.
23. What makes all this, to proue that Chriſt did fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhe
our redemption onelie in hope? The queſtion
is heere, how Chriſt hath finiſhed our redemption?
not, how we poſſeſſe it. Seeing our hope is not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine
and vnſtable, but ſetled on a ſure ground:
doth not theſe places rather proue, that Chriſt hath
done al fullie and abſolutely? For if he did but hope
how could wee be ſure? Your vnſhapely argument
that you would fain faſten on vs, and your other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments

Heere, you do vs open wrong, and accuſe your

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:178019:82"/>
Chriſts paſsion. What Rhethorick ſoeuer this bee,
it is bad Diuinitie. Wee neuer denied that hee went
downe into Hell, but that euer hee deſcended into
the pit of the damned. From whence, if you will in
good logick, gather your concluſion: your wit rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
manie myles beyond our capacities. For, wee
are perſwaded, that there can be no ſurer argument,
neither of Hel, nor of the certaintie of our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
then that he ſuffered all the tormentes of Hell
vpon the croſſe, and made a full ſatisfaction for all
our offences. Which thing, he could not haue done,
if there were no hell: and which thing, if hee hath
done (as we are ſurelie perſwaded) there is nothing
more ſure then our redemption. For, ſeeing hee ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
vpon the tree, the paine of al our ſinnes, as Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
witneſſeth, and hell was due to our iniquities: it
is as ſure, (as what is moſt ſure) that vpon the tree,
that is, vpon the croſſe, hee deſcended into the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ermoſt
Hell: that is, into the heauieſt torments that
Hell could yeeld: and this, except you will confeſſe,
you muſt grant that the Symboll (as wee call it) of
the Apoſtles, and doe ſo reuerentlie embrace, is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect.
For ſeeing the greateſt part of our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
conſiſteth in Chriſts ſuffering in ſoule, for our
ſoules: it was more needfull in that Symbol to make
mention of them, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the deth of his body, both
becauſe they were more horrible vnto him, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
remooued from our ſenſes. Which thing, if it
be true, (as it is moſt certaine) in what other words
(I pray you) of that Symboll, is that contained?
but in theſe, he deſcended into hell? For, that which
goeth before, hee was crucified, dead and buried,
may be as well affirmed of the the theeues, that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
with him.</p>

on our ſide. I thinke it is like true, that you
know anie ſuch, and that we holde this article nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuelie.
Wee holde that Chriſt deſcended into Hell,
and ſuffered all his torments for our redemption,
which I haue beene taught to be an affirmatiue, by
better Logicians, then Doctor Hill. But one tolde
you, that <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> did inſert this article: A
diſcreet Paſtor, would haue admoniſhed one man ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
priuatlie: then haue troubled ſuch an aſſemblie
with ſuch a doubt in publick. Whoſoeuer hee was
that tolde you that, hee learned it not by anie ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue
that wee holde, but of one of your Doctors.
<hi>Eraſmus</hi> is the firſt that euer I heard bring that in
queſtion, a man on your ſide, and one of your cheef
ankers. Calvine in his booke of the Inſtitution of
Chriſtian Religion ſaieth, that ſome are of that
judgement, moſte likelie noting him, and men that
followed his opinion. But how-ſo-euer it came,
there hee proves it to bee an article, both conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
and agreeable to the Scriptures, and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
to the perfection of the Symboll of our Faith.
Therefore, Maiſter Doctor, you doe not well, to
lay the faultes of your owne favorites and freendes,
to our charges.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:178019:83"/>
It was the improbabilitie of your opinion, that
droue a man of ſo much judgement as <hi>Eraſmus</hi> was,
to make that doubt. But <hi>Carlill</hi> and <hi>Servetus</hi> you ſay
do denie it. In your printed ſermon, as you call it,
you lay your malice more open. There you alledge
for this antiquitie joined with veritie, (ſo there you
call your owne opinion) all the learned of all ages,
old and new: all the Prophetes and Apoſtles, and ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>billes

earth, liuing and dead: and laſtlie, all the Divels the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.
Onelie ſome poſſeſſed (you ſay) with Divels,

vtter your choller more plainelie, challenging to
your owne ſide, all the learned of all ages, olde and
newe, and leauing nothing to your aduerſaries, but
block-iſme, dol-tiſme, and diueliſh giddineſſe. But,
(God bee thanked) you haue not the diſpoſing of
gifts and ſpirits. There be men that denyes your o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
to haue anie ground in the word, as farre ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling
you in all kindes of learning, as you count
your ſelf before Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> your Curat at Gooſage:
and of ſuch zeale and conſtancy in Gods cauſe, with
out regard of wordlie preferments, as I pray God a
man that can holde two benefices, and would haue
ſeauen if he could get them, might mend that fault,
and ſhew himſelf as farre from Diueliſh giddineſſe,
as they. As for <hi>Servetus,</hi> I neuer ſaw his book, which
Calvine in his Epiſtles doth ſay, was printed at <hi>Vien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na.</hi>
But this I know, that he held many groſſe errors,
concerning the Trinitie, Humanitie, and Deitie of
Chriſt: as it is apparent in an Epiſtle written by the
Miniſters of Baſil, to the Syndicks and ſenate of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva.
As for this queſtion, I know not what he held
but it is not likelie, that euer he touched it. And this

                  <hi>Carlill,</hi> (excepting his fault) was a man for judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

He made a ſlip, indeede, as who hath not? Though
you throwe the firſt ſtone at him, you are not cleare
your ſelf. Beſides the mani-ſlips made in this book,
and other pulpits alſo: you taught on S. Iames his
day in <hi>Trubridge Anno</hi> 1591. If I do wel remember
the yeare, that weomen did beare children without
pain, in time of innocencie. And becauſe you would
be ſure not to be miſtaken, you did repeate it in the
after noone, in the ſame tearmes that you ſpake it in
the fore-noone: a fault of leſſe judgement and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
then <hi>Carlils</hi> was. The Iewes bee enemies to our
faith, and therefore doe not meete with vs, nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge

As for the place that they take from you in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
Pſalme, and wherupon your choller doth riſe,
I ſee no cauſe why they are not to bee beleeued in
their owne tougue, before all others that haue lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

great defendants, which doe rather ſpeake for
you, then confirme your opinion, either with ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
or reaſon. I was my ſelf of your opinion, till the
ſway of truth, (which I haue alwaies rather follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

ignorant may not think, that you haue all the world
on your ſide. Whether you regarde the nomber or
the excellencie of the men: our cauſe is nothing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour

it had beene more Chriſtian-like, to haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed
him by priuate conference. But ſeeing his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine

times, and is ſo fortreſſed with Scripture and reaſon
as heere you ſee: it wanteth all excuſe of modeſtie to
handle him in open audience, before ſuch a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
in ſuch ſort, as <hi>M. Chalfont</hi> did, and you confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in action, though not in words. For my part, I
am, and will be on his ſide, till I heere better reaſon
from you. Which when it commeth, it ſhal carie me
to anie truth, that you can proue. Further, I wil not
wagge the bredth of a naile. If you can plainelie
without cloak and colour, confute my reaſons and
confirm your owne: I promiſe you to turne my ſong
If otherwaies, I hope you will bee as good as that
word which you paſt in the pulpite, before ſo manie
witneſſes. If you will ſatisfie mee, you muſt anſwere
me by writing. For ſpoken words paſſe faſter away,
then my dull ſenſes can digeſt the reaſons. I wrote
this in Latine, becauſe I wold not haue it vnderſtood
of the common ſort. I tranſlated it into Engliſhe, at
the ſute of a Gentleman, that lay heer the laſt ſpring.
That copie (by ſome negligence,) went farther a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
then I was willing. I left it with a freend or

They conferring together, delayed it till my returne

               <p>TRuth it is that you did preach ſince at <hi>Leycocke,</hi>
not for contentions ſake, but to haue the laſte
word. For, hearing that <hi>M. Wiſedom</hi> had broached
his opinion at <hi>Coſham,</hi> and had perſwaded Chriſtian
men to doubt of the articles of their fatih, (ſo your
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:178019:88"/>
words do ſound) you could not holde your fingers.
For my parte, I am much in your favour. For you
were content to ſee mee miſuſe all the Prophetes &amp;
Apoſtles, and Chriſt himſelfe, and would not haue
ſaid to mee ſo much as black is my eie, if ſome vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruelie
tongues blemiſhing your credite, had not ſet
you a worke. But blab it is, and out it muſt. You ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed
M. Wiſedom of this fault, in the beginning of
your ſermon at <hi>Chippenhame,</hi> and accuſed him againe
(vnawares) in the end of it. In the laſt ſection, you
ſay, that you ſpake that of <hi>Carlill, Servetus,</hi> and ſome
that tolde you, that <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> did inſert this
article: and now againe (vnaduiſedlie) you ſay heer,
that you preached againe at <hi>Leycocke,</hi> after that you
had heard of M. Wiſedomes preaching at Coſham,
becauſe you would haue no Chriſtian man, to doubt
of the articles of his faith. If this ſermon to this end
was need-full in your eies: Then in your conceit M.
Wiſedome had taught men at Coſham, to doubt of
the articles of their Faith: contrarie to your firſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
at Cippenhame, and your laſte ſection heere.
<hi>Carlil</hi> and <hi>Servetus</hi> did help to couer this ſlip before.
Now, what cloak will you finde, to hide this contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
againe? My ſimple head cannot ſound into
the depth of your excuſes: and therfore, I leaue it to
your ſelf to prooue, that this ſlip did leape ouer the
hatch, againſt your will. Now, you ſay, that I do ask
you what comfortable or neceſſary matter you teach
that we denie. To this (with proteſtation praemiſed)
that I marke it conſideratlie, as though you woulde
not let one ſillable fall in waſte: you begin a long
diſcours of the magnitude, multitude, turpitude, &amp;c
of our ſinnes, and of Chriſts paines for our pardon,
of his reſurrection, aſcenſion, and many other things
which wee acknowledge, as well as you: all which,
while my eares prepared by your proteſtation, did
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:178019:88"/>
hearken for the promiſed comfort we teach not: at
length commeth out, that we beeing ſubject to two
great curſes, death and damnation, Chriſt deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
into the graue to deliuer vs from the one, and
into Hell to deliuer vs from the other. This is right
<hi>Parturiunt montes.</hi> That Chriſt went downe into Hell,
is not our comfort. Our comfort is, that he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered
vs from the bands of hell, which we teach &amp;
acknowledge as wel as you. But if this your doctrine
be true, then is it falſe that Peter teacheth 2. 24. that
Chriſt bare our ſinnes in his bodie on the tree, and
his ſacrifice vnperfect. Wherefore to conclude, <hi>mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus

(ſay you) though we agniſe this (that is your tearm)
as well as you. Yet becauſe wee denie the meane
thereof, wee denie a moſte comfortable doctrine.
The meane of our ſalvation was not his going down
into the Hell of the damned, which wee denye: nor
the laying of him vp three daies in Ioſephs tombe
which we confeſſe. But his ſuffering in his innocent
ſoule and bodie, al the torments and miſeries of hel
and death; which wee muſt haue ſuffered, if hee had
not ſtept in betweene vs and them. I will not onelie

turne your comfort into murning, and your joy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
teares, if it ſtand on no better ground then this.
But ſay you, if all the articles going before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
after, bee vnderſtood of Chriſts perſon: then
this article of his deſcending muſte ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e the ſame
ſenſe: But the firſt is true: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the laſt is alſo true.
This is a good argument, but the concluſion is not
for your hand. If you had but one ſuch for your
maine-ſhot of deſcending, a whole reame of paper
royall, would bee too little for your amplifications.
But heer your malice driving you to imagine much
abſurditie in our opinion, doeth deceaue you. For
wee holde and will die for it, that Chriſt in his owne
perſon bodie and ſoule, did deſcend into all the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
that hel could yeelde. And this indeede is a
true deſcending into Hell. For the nature and name
of Hell, doth yeeld nothing but horrour, terror, tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
and torments. But in your opinion, we muſt i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine
all things contrarie. Not torments, but tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph:
nor ſorrowes, but ſolace: not ſhame and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominie,
but honour and glory. Hell doeth yeelde
no ſuch frutes, nor the deſcending into hell, can bee
to no ſuch ende. Take therefore your potentiall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending
into Hell, and the conqueſt thereof by the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:178019:89"/>
onlie power of the Deitie, and buy a benefice with it.
Whereas you ſay that our opinion doeth open a gap
to manie errors: you pretend a feare without grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,
to make the Reader affraied of the moone-ſhade. It
is the manner of politick men, that would faine hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a thing, that reaſon doeth further, to ſet feare of
ſequels againſt the force of known reaſon. Heer you
flee to that ſhift, though you know, that amongeſt al
the writers, that haue embraced this opinion (which
be manie, &amp; of great name) not one yet can be tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with one error growing in this fountaine. In this
ſection you hamper about another argument, but
cannot hit the marke. Wherefore to ſaue your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
I will heere make it vp, and breake the point
of it, when I haue done, that you may ſee it cannot

               </gap>urt vs. It is this. There is greater reaſon that Chriſt
ſhould haue beene held three daies of Hell without
paine: then three daies of the graue without cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.
But hee was three dayes in the graue with<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>out
corruption. <hi>Ergo,</hi> he was farre rather thre daies
in Hell without paine. Becauſe it is not likelie, that
the weaker did faſten faſter on him, then the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger:
beeing as far inferiour in malice, as it is leſſe in
power. To this I anſwere, that there is not the like
reaſon, much leſſe greater reaſon. For, hee lay three
dayes in the graue to confirme our knowledge, and
to extinguiſhe all doubt of his death. Secondlie, to
lay a grounded beleef in our hearts of the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
For, he was the firſt frutes of the dead. Thirdlie,
to make his reſurrection more glorious. For the lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
he was held in the bandes of death, the greater
glorie it was to breake them, gathering ſtrength
by continuance. Laſtlie, to take all blockes out of
the path of faith, that wee might walke in it more
ſurelie, without ſtumbling. I knowe no ſuch reaſons
why he ſhould haue deſcended into the very place of
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:178019:90"/>
hell being ſo farre remooued from our ſenſes, as we
could receiue neither knowledge nor comfort ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.
Now, whereas you take mee vp, for ſaying that
the world is ſorrie for you: my wordes might haue
had a tollerable conſtruction, if you had caſt an eie

and proued out of <hi>Peters</hi> ſermon my aſſertion, and to

To proue, that this phraſe, (the nethermoſt parts of

manner ſaide nothing. Thirdlie, in all your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweres

cauſe in it is diſplaied the greatnes of the battell, the worthines of
the victory, &amp; the joye of the conqueſt. The Printer (for I think M.
Fox neuer cared greatly, what ſigne they hanged at his ſhop dore)
or if it was M. Fox himſelfe, all is one, deviſed a picture to expreſſe
the matter within the book. A man with foure wound, in his hands
&amp; fect, inveſted in a bright cloud, with a gliſtering flame, as it were
of fame, &amp; glory glimmering about his face, ſtanding with the one
foot on the head of a Dragon: and the other on the heart of death.
