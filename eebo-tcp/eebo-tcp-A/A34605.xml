            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Bishop COZENS's
ARGUMENT,
PROVING, THAT
Adultery works a Dissolution of the Marriage.</head>
            <head type="sub">Being the Substance of several of Bishop COZENS his
Speeches in the House of Lords, upon the Debate of the
Lord Ross's Case.</head>
            <head type="sub">Taken from Original Papers writ in the Bishop's own Hand.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>THE Question is indefinitely to be spoken of,</hi> Whether a Man being divor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
from his Wife, who hath committed Adultery, and is convicted of it, may
Marry himself to another Wife or no, during the Life of her which is divor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.</p>
            <p>The Place in St. <hi>Matthew the 5th,</hi> repeated again St. <hi>Matthew the 19th,</hi> has great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuity:
If it be not lawful for any man to put away his Wife, and Marry again,
except it be in the Case of Fornication, (for the displacing the Words, by putting the
Exception before the Marriage, cannot alter the Sense); then <hi>Ã  contrario,</hi> it must of
necessity follow, That if the Wife be put away for Fornication, the Husband by the
Tenor of Christ's Words is left free to Marry again; which Freedom is not allow'd
the Adulteress her self, nor to any man else that shall Marry her.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Mark</hi> and St. <hi>Luke</hi> have been opposed to St. <hi>Matthew;</hi> and it has been said, that
<hi>Christ</hi>'s words in St. <hi>Matthew</hi> did not properly belong to <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>Disciples,</hi> or the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Church,</hi> as the words in St. <hi>Mark</hi> and St. <hi>Luke,</hi> which are absolute, do; which
is a Saying that neither I, nor, I think, no body else ever heard of before: For <hi>Christ</hi>'s
Sermon in the Mount was spoken to <hi>his Disciples;</hi> and especially belonged to <hi>Christians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis clear they are spoken to <hi>his Disciples;</hi> for he says to them, that they are <hi>the
Salt of the Earth, and the Light of the World;</hi> and that they are <hi>blessed, when</hi> they <hi>suffer
persecution for his Name's sake;</hi> which no man will say or apply to the <hi>Iews.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis true, that in the 19th <hi>Chapter</hi> of St. <hi>Matthew, Christ</hi> answers the <hi>Scribes</hi> and
<hi>Pharisees,</hi> who came to tempt him with their Question, <hi>Whether it was lawful for a man
to put away his Wife for any cause,</hi> as they said <hi>Moses had permitted them to do.</hi> But the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
that <hi>Christ</hi> gave them, That it was not lawful, <hi>but only in the case of Adultery, for
men to put away their Wives, and to marry another,</hi> was a Rule which concerned <hi>all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi>
to observe for ever after; and for that reason was recorded by St. <hi>Matthew.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The words in St. <hi>Mark</hi> and St. <hi>Luke,</hi> are not to be taken absolutely, but to be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
and understood by his words in St. <hi>Matthew;</hi> as in many other Cases is clear; <hi>viz.</hi>
the Thief upon the Cross, Baptism in the Name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereof many Instances may be brought, as the destruction of <hi>Niniveh,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But for <hi>Christ</hi>'s words, the Exception confirms the Rule, and infers a Concession,
that in the Case of <hi>Fornication,</hi> the putting away one Wife, and Marrying another,
is allowed. It is alike with divers other his Exceptions, which are found in Scripture:
For brevity, I will instance in this one (<hi>vix.) Except re repent, ye shall all likewise perish:</hi>
Upon which Text, if I or any Bishop else were to Preach. I believe we should not
discharge our Duty, unless we should tell the People, That if by the Grace of <hi>God</hi>
they did repent, they should not perish.</p>
            <p>The Exception here, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>nisi,</hi> unless, is parallel with the 1 <hi>Kings 3. 18. None
were in the house, except we twain;</hi> they Two therefore were, others were not.</p>
            <p>Such Exceptions proceeding from natural Equity, are tacitly implied in Laws, tho
pronounced in general Terms.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:107474:2"/>
But as to the Exception here, the Words are not capable of any other Sense than
as I have observed; for except that Restraint be referred to Marrying again, the Sense
would run thus, <hi>Whosoever puts away his Wife commits Adultery;</hi> which stands not with
Truth or Reason; since it is not the Dismission that is Adulterous, but the Marriage
of another. It is, therefore, the plain drift of our Saviour to teach the <hi>Pharisee,</hi> that
the Marriage of a Second Wife after a Dismission of a Former, <hi>upon any other cause, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
for fornication,</hi> is no less than Adultery; thereby inferring, That upon a Just Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
for Fornication, a second Marriage cannot be branded with Adultery.</p>
            <p>Besides, the <hi>Pharisee</hi>'s Question <hi>[Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every
cause]</hi> was not without a plain implication of Liberty to marry another; which <hi>our
Saviour</hi> well knowing, gives a full Answer, as well to what he meant, as what he
said; which had not been perfectly satisfactory, if he had only determined that one part
concerning Dismission, and not the other concerning Marriage; which Clause, if
Two <hi>Evangelists</hi> express not, yet it must be fetch'd necessarily from the Third; since
it is a sure and irrefragable Rule, <hi>That all Four Evangelists make up one perfect Gospel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> Rhemists <hi>and College of</hi> Doway <hi>urge for the</hi> Popish <hi>Doctrine,</hi> Rom. 7. 2. The wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
which hath an husband, is bound by the law to her husband as long as he liveth. <hi>But</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. This place is to be Expounded by <hi>Christ</hi>'s Words.</p>
            <p>2. St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath no occasion here to speak of <hi>Divorce,</hi> but of <hi>Marriage whole and
sound,</hi> as it stands by <hi>God</hi>'s Ordinance.</p>
            <p>3. He speaks of a Woman who is under an Husband; so is not she that is divorced
from him.</p>
            <p>4. St. <hi>Paul</hi> useth this to his purpose of the Law being dead, to which we are not
bound.</p>
            <p>Nor is their Doctrine more favoured by 1 <hi>Cor. 7. 10. Let not the woman depart;</hi> as
being in her Choice whether she would depart or not: But in the Case of <hi>Fornication,</hi>
she was to depart, or rather be <hi>put away,</hi> whether she would or not.</p>
            <p>The Bond of the Marriage is to be enquired into, what it properly is. Being a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal
Promise Solemnly made between a man and his Wise, That each of them will
live together according to <hi>God</hi>'s Holy Ordinance, notwithstanding Poverty or Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or such other things as may happen during their Lives. Separation from Bed and
Board, which is part of their Promise so to live together, doth plainly break that part
of the Bond whereby they are tied to live together both as to Bed and Board: The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
betwixt Bed and Board and the Bond, is new, never mentioned in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and unknown in the Ancient Church; devised only by the <hi>Canonists</hi> and the <hi>School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>
in the <hi>Latin Church</hi> (for the <hi>Greek Church</hi> knows it not) to serve the <hi>Pope's</hi> turn
the better, till he got it established in the <hi>Council of Trent;</hi> at which time, and never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
he laid his <hi>Anathema</hi> upon all them that were of another Mind; forbidding all
men to marry, and <hi>not to make any use of Christ's Concession.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Bed and Board, or Cohabitation, belong to the Essence and Substance of Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
which made <hi>Erasmus</hi> and Bishop <hi>Hall</hi> say, <hi>That the distinction of those two from the
Bond, is merely Chimerical, and Fancy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The promise of Constancy and mutual Forbearance, if it hinders Divorce as to the
<hi>Bond,</hi> hinders it also as to Bed and Board; because the same Bed, and the same Table
were promised in the Marriage Contract; but the Promise does not extend even to
Tolerating <hi>Adultery,</hi> or <hi>Malicious Desertion;</hi> which, according to <hi>God's Ordinance, Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves
the Marriage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Our Saviour</hi> speaks of Divorces Instituted by the <hi>Mosaical Law;</hi> but they were no
other than Divorces from the <hi>Bond.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Form of the <hi>Bill of Divorce,</hi> among the <hi>Iews</hi> was this, <hi>Be Expelled from me,
and free for any Body else.</hi> To give the Bill of Divorce, is from the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Root <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap>,
which is to break, or cut off the Marriage. With this agree the Ancient <hi>Canons,
Councils,</hi> and <hi>Fathers</hi> of the Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Concil. Neocaesar. &amp; Elib.</hi> forbid the retaining an Adulterous Wife. <hi>Concil. Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.
Aurelian. &amp; Arelatens.</hi> give Liberty in such Case to marry again. <hi>Clemens</hi>'s Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
<hi>Tertullian,</hi> St. <hi>Basil</hi> in his Canons, approved by a General Council, are for
Marrying again. <hi>Concil. Venet.</hi> If they marry in any other Case than Fornication,
they are to be <hi>Excommunicated,</hi> and not otherwise. <hi>Concil Wormat.</hi> gives Liberty to the
Innocent Party to Marry after Divorce. <hi>Concil Lateran.</hi> gives leave for the Innocent
Party after a Year to marry again.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Concil. Lateran.</hi> If any one take another Wife while a Suit is depending, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
there be a Divorce between him and the First, he may remain with the Second.</p>
            <p>Lactantius, <hi>St.</hi> Hierom <hi>and</hi> Epiphanius, <hi>are for allowance of Marriage after Divorce.</hi>
Chrysostom, Hom. 19. 1 Cor. 7. <hi>says, That</hi> the Marriage is dissolved by adultery; and that
the husband, after he hath put her away, is no longer her husband.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:107474:2"/>
               <hi>Theophylact</hi> on the <hi>16th.</hi> of St. <hi>Luke,</hi> says, That St. <hi>Luke</hi> must be interpreted by
St. <hi>Matthew.</hi> St. <hi>Hillary</hi> is for marrying again, as Dr. <hi>Fulk</hi> saith upon St. <hi>Matthew</hi>
the V<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. The <hi>Eastern</hi> Bishops, in the <hi>Council of Florence,</hi> are for marrying again.
<hi>Iustin Matyr</hi> speaks of a Christian Woman's giving a bill of Divorce to a Dissolute
Husband, without finding any fault with it.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> says, a man may marry again, if he put away an adulterous Wife;
<hi>Theodoret</hi> said of a Wife who violated the Laws of Marriage: <hi>Therefore our Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
the Bond or Tye of Marriage to be dissolved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All the <hi>Greek Church</hi> to this day allow it. <hi>Erasmus, Cajetan,</hi> and other Papists:
The Civil Law, and the Laws of the Emperor, are clear for it: And the Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of our own Church of <hi>England,</hi> in the time of <hi>H. 8. E.</hi> 6. and Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Practice of the <hi>English</hi> Church: In the Stat. 1 <hi>Iac. c.</hi> 11. against Second Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages,
Divorces are excepted; and in <hi>Canon</hi> 107. 'tis provided they shall not marry again;
but it is not said such Marriages are void, only the Caution is forfeited: <hi>Neither doth
the Canon speak of such Separations, wherein the Bond it self is broken, as 'tis by Fornication.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Even the <hi>Canon-Law</hi> allows marrying again, in case a Woman seek her Husband's
Life; and in case of Bond woman. <hi>Gratian</hi> says, in the Case of Adultery Lawful
Mar<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap>iages ought not to be denied. In the Case of an Incurable Leprosy, it was the
Advice of St. <hi>Gregory</hi> to <hi>Austin</hi> the Monk, That he that could not contain, should
rather marry. <hi>Bellermin</hi> owns that the Bond of the Marriage of Infidels is dissolvable;
but the Marriage of the Faithful, and of Infidels, is of the same nature: And <hi>Iustini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>
a Jesuit, confesses, that it is simply lawfull for the Innocent Party to marry again.
And the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctors allow a dissolution of the Bond of Marriage, if the Parties
should, after consummation, transfer themselves into a Friery or Nunnery.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Canons</hi> which in the case of Adultery prohibit Marrying in the Life time of the
guilty Person, are contrary to Two Acts of Parliament made 25 <hi>H.</hi> 8. and 3 <hi>&amp; 4 E.</hi> 6.
wherein no <hi>Canons</hi> are allowed that be any way <hi>repugnant to the Laws of God,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>We have examples of such Marriages in <hi>H.</hi> 4. of <hi>France, H.</hi> 8. of <hi>England,</hi> Lord
<hi>Mountjoy,</hi> Lord <hi>Rich,</hi> Bishop <hi>Thornborough,</hi> and divers others. And it is observable,
That in the Case of the <hi>Marquess of Northampton, 5 E.</hi> 6. who had been divorced for
his Lady's Adultery, and married another before any Act of Parliament made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
it, an Act which passed afterwards (only two Spiritual, and two Temporal
Lords dissenting) declares he had been <hi>at liberty by the Laws of God to marry,</hi> and did
<hi>lawfully marry</hi> another; Where the Act manifestly supposes, that whatever had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
for Law till that time, was void, as being <hi>contrary to God's Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The most considerable Men of the Reform'd Churches both at home and abroad,
are of this Opinion: <hi>Grotius</hi> quotes <hi>Tertullian,</hi> in whose time it was lawful for the
Innocent Party to Marry.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lancelot Inst. Iur. Can,</hi> acknowledges that Divorce is a dissolution of the Marriage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Selden,</hi> who is not likely to contradict the Laws of this Kingdom, maintaineth,
That Marriage after Divorce is to be allowed: And in that particular, Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>
doth not contradict him, but is clearly for it.</p>
            <p>The Opinion of <hi>Amesius</hi> deserves to be set down at large: <q>Marriage, says he, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be dissolved by men at their pleasure; and for that reason, as it is considered sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
and absolutely, it is rightly said to be indissolvable; because Marriage is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a Civil, but a Divine Conjunction; and is also of that nature, that it cannot be
dissolved without detriment to either Party: Yet it is not so indissolvable, but it
may be dissolved for a Cause which God approves as just; for the Indissolvability was
not instituted for a Punishment, but for the Comfort of Innocent Persons; and it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
an Exception, wherein God ceases to conjoyn. By Adultery two are made not to
remain one Flesh: hence it is, that a Contagious Disease is not a Cause of dissolving
Marriage. <hi>By Adultery the very Essence of the Contract is directly violated; but the
Contract ceasing, the Bond d<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>pending on the Contract necessarily ceases.</hi> It is against all
reason, that all Matrimonial Duties should be for ever taken away, yet the Bond
or Obligation to those Duties should continue. The words of <hi>our Lord, Matth.</hi> 5. 32.
and 19. 9. have no distinction or limitation of the putting away, but simply and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
approve of putting away; therefore they approve of a putting away, not
partial, or to a particular purpose, from Bed and Board, but <hi>Total.</hi>

            <p>Upon the difference of Explication between St. <hi>Ambrose, Origen,</hi> and St. <hi>Austin,</hi> a
new kind of Divorce has been thought of, <hi>from Bed and Board;</hi> but this <hi>Divorce,</hi> or
<hi>Name of a Divorce,</hi> was unknown to the <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Ancient Christians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I said so much before, at the First and Second reading of this Bill, that I was in
good hopes to have had no further occasion given me of answering any Objections
against it now; but seeing divers new Arguments have been studied and framed
against it since that time, I shall now endeavour to satisfie and clear them all.</p>
            <p>1. The First Argument against it, is, That the Separation from Bed and Board
doth not dissolve the Bond of Marriage. To which I must Reply, as I did before,
That this is a distinction without a difference; newly invented by the <hi>Canonists</hi> and
<hi>Schoolmen,</hi> and never heard of either in the <hi>Old</hi> or <hi>New Test<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap>ment,</hi> nor in the times of
the Antient Fathers, who accounted the Separation from Bed and Board, to be the
Dissolution of the Bond it self.</p>
            <p>2. That first Institution of Marriage, that they may be <hi>one Flesh,</hi> is by Adultery
dissolved, when the Adultress makes her selfe <hi>one Flesh with</hi> another Man; and <hi>thereby
dissolves the first Bond of her Marriage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The Objection, that if the Bond be dissolved, and afterwards, if the Man or
Woman be reconciled, they must be Married over again, is no necessary Consequence,
no more than 'tis in a Person baptized, who may break his Covenant, and renounce
his Baptism; and yet upon true Repentance be received into God's Favour by virtue
of the first Covenant, without any new Baptism. Suppose a Witch, who they say
makes a Compact with the Devil, to renounce her Baptism; should afterwards, by
the Grace of God, seriously and truly Repent her self of the Wickedness; I do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that any body would take upon him to Baptize her again: and if a Priest should
renounce his Orders, and turn <hi>Turk,</hi> and yet afterwards repent him, and return into
the Church; he need not be Re-ordained a second time. The Case will be the same
in Marriage.</p>
            <p>4. I said heretofore, That the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctors allowed this Dissolution of the Bond
when the Man and Wife, even after the Consummation of Marriage, would transfer
themselves into a Friary, or a Nunnery: but because it hath been since doubted, that
no Authority can be shewed for this particular, I shall here shew it out of the old Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions
of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And in the Case of Religion,<note place="margin">Prov. Will. Lindewode, five Const. Ang. fol. 94. Ver. nul. late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Separen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</note> that is the true understanding, that to wit, either
of them betaking themselves to Religion before Carnal Knowledge, the Bond of the
Marriage be dissolved: but <hi>if both enter into Religion, and make solemn Profession, then
such Marriage is dissolved, even as to the Bond.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>5 <hi>It hath also been said, that if the Bill pass, it will pass against the</hi> Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:
<hi>which I confess, I do not understand: For</hi> the Church of <hi>England</hi> is within the
Kingdom of <hi>England; and if the Laws of this Kingdom be for the Bill, and have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
it by the Assent of the King, Lords, and Commons, as in the Case of the</hi>
Marquis <hi>of</hi> Northampton, <hi>was</hi> heretofore declared in the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the 6th.
That by the Laws of God the Innocent Party was at liberty to Marry again; <hi>Certainly the</hi>
Spiritual Lords, <hi>as well as the</hi> Temporal <hi>and</hi> Commons, <hi>are bound to admit it: and</hi>
I know not why they should be called the Church <hi>England,</hi> that joyn with the Council of
<hi>Trent,</hi> and plead so much to uphold it; rather than others that joyn with all the Reformed
Churches, and plead against that Canon of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which hath laid an Anae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema
upon us, if we do not agree with them.</p>
            <p>As to the supposed Inconveniences that will follow upon Marrying again,</p>
            <p>1. More Inconveniences will follow if they be forbidden to Marry again.</p>
            <p>2. The Father would be in an uncertainty of the Children, if he should retain the
Adulteress.</p>
            <p>3. There would be danger of poysoning or killing one another, if no Second Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
were allowed.</p>
            <p>4. Where the Parties should consent to new Marriages for their own Lusts, the
Magistrates have Power to over-rule such Practices.</p>
            <p>5. If they be kept altogether by Divorce from Marrying, it would occasion the
Innocent Party to Sin.</p>
