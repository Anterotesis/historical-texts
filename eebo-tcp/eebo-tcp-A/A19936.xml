            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>For very Murther they hold it no great ſinne, being commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, receiuing of the Popes pardon, or elſe getting into ſome Monaſterie where they may be confeſſed, and abſolued, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by no Law can take hold of them at their comming forth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing apt and readie within a wéeke, or fortnight after to commit the like Murther, then receiuing the like pardon, or abſolution, as before they had done: and thus many bloodie minded men continue their life-time, for it is an eaſie matter for a man to haue his aduerſarie kild, or poyſoned for money, although his executioner neuer ſée him till ſuch time as he committeth this bloudie déed, being hired by another.</p>

So it is lawfull for any man to vſe any of theſe women as his owne wife, neither ſhall he be moleſted or troubled, or otherwiſe indangered, ſo he eſcape ſecret occaſions of danger, for this woman will be as dutifull vnto him as his ſeruant, alwaies attending his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure for his diet or any thing elſe belonging vnto him: he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing her content with his purſe; but ſhe not receiuing content may as lawfully arreſt him, and caſt him into priſon till ſuch time as ſhe doth receiue ſatiſfaction, being recouered by Law: for they hold their liuings by the Pope.</p>

In theſe Countries it is dangerous for an Engliſhman being a Proteſtant to ſpeake any thing againſt the Pope, or his Religion, eſpecially vnto another Engliſhman that is a Papiſt, yet this Engliſh Papiſt will ſéeke all the meanes poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to intrappe the Proteſtant, and will ſpeake ill words of himſelfe, to draw him to the like, but when he hath made him vtter the ſecrets of his heart, then will he make it knowne, and more then the Proteſtant ſpake, to ſome chiefe man of a Church, by whom he ſhall be forced to alter his Religion, or to be burned, or put in ſome ſecret priſon where he ſhall be ſtarued to death, and this is the manner and faſhion in all Countries of Chriſtendome within the Popes Juriſdiction, not onely of the treacherie of the Engliſh Papiſts, but alſo of the other deadly ſinnes which I touched before, as their mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and adultry: and in like manner of their generall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, to a diſtreſſed Chriſtian. What I haue héere writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, I ſpeake not of heare-ſay, nor by imaignation, but directly haue ſéene, and of mine owne knowledge you may ſpeake it, being too long a time amongſt them, againſt my will.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:9909:7"/>
and platformes, with great ſtore of Ordinance planted about it, alſo there are many Gallies belonging to this place, which doe much offend the Chriſtians, in taking of their ſhips, <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes</hi> and <hi>Satties,</hi> and other ſmall veſſels, making all the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians that they take ſlaues, &amp; ſelling of them in their markets like horſes: for according to age and ſtrength they are priſed. This Citie is gouerned by a King, being vaſſall to the great Turke. Alſo there are great ſtore of Janizaries in it, to the number of 20. or 30000. at one time: theſe Ianizaries are chiefe Souldiers, and gouerned by a Dane, which is a generall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the great Turke. Theſe Turks are goodly people of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and of a very faire complexion, but very villains in minde, for they are altogether Sodomites, and doe all things contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to a Chriſtian. For they doe neuer lye in a bed, nor féede vpon a Table; yet their féeding and diet is very plentifull, their bedding and apparrell is very neat and coſtly, the manner of their lodging is thus: There is a very faire table in a roome, about thrée yards in breadth, and as many in length ſtanding in height one yard from the ground, and thereon they vſe to ſpread a double quilt very coſtly with many curious Cuſhions, in ſtead of Pillowes, whereon he lieth downe in his ſhirt, and linnen britches onely, without any other couering, by reaſon of the heat of the countrey. Alſo in the ſame roome he hath ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Table laid after the ſame faſhion very richly, whereon his wiues doe lie, but ſhe that likes him beſt, he will take to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company him for the night. A Turke may haue as many wiues as he pleaſeth, ſo he be able to buy them, and by the number of his wiues, moſt commonly his ſubſtance is knowne, for the richer he is, the more wiues he hath, the poorer the fewer: yet neuer married to none of them, but onely the firſt, but maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of them all. It is very dangerous for a Chriſtian to be found in the company of any Turkes woman, for being found together, he ſhall be forced to turne Turke, or elſe be put to death, and the ſaid woman alſo ſhall be put into a ſacke, which being made faſt, ſhe ſhall be flung into the Sea, whether they commit the ſinne or not. Theſe Turkes are very zealous in their religion, acknowledging God; and <hi>Mahomet</hi> a ſoliciter


<pb facs="tcp:9909:7"/>
for their ſinnes. A Turke will kéepe his word if he ſweares by his head, putting his hand vpon his forehead. In this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey there is great ſtore of gold and rich Marchants; the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their Churches and comming to Prayer is thus. The Church is very faire within, with many hundreds of Lampes burning therein, all matted vnder foote, without any kinde of picture, or ſeats, alſo moſt of them doe pray vpon Beads. In the morning on the top of the Church they hang out a white flag, and in the after noone a blew one for a ſigne of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to Church, then goeth eight or tenne of them on the very top of the Church, and crie with a loud voice. <hi>Volla, volla hamdrulla</hi> and <hi>ſhalla,</hi> that is to ſay God, God, helpe vs at thy pleaſure, and this is their ordinary warning to come to Church, as we vſe Bels in Chriſtendome, for they abhorre the ringing of Bels, being contrary to their Prophets command.</p>
               <p>A Turke chooſeth his firſt wife after this maner. He neuer ſéeth his wife till ſhe come to the Church to be maried, for the match is made by their friends, neither is a Turkiſh womans face to be ſéene, becauſe their faces are continually couered going through the ſtréets, both young and old: neither ſhall a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>childe after he is tenne yeeres old euer ſée his mother. A Turke is Circumciſed after this manner. The better Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman he is, the longer he ſtayes afore he be Circumciſed, but the time being come, then is he put vpon a very faire white horſe, being very coſtly attired, and before him goeth two, or three hundreth by two and two in purple coates, bearing waxe candles in their hands, and after them followeth a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny playing on diffuſed Inſtruments making of a great noiſe, then followeth a Bull couered with very faire Arras, and his hornes gilded, and next rideth he that ſhall be Circumciſed, with all his friends following, and thus he rideth to the place of Circumciſion, where they cut off the foreſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:9909:8"/>
home where they doe feaſt with great ioy.</p>
               <p>The manner of a Chriſtian turning Turke, is thus. He is put vpon a horſe with his face towards the tayle, and a Bow and an Arrow in his hand, then the picture of Chriſt is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried before him with his feete vpwards, at the which he drawes his Bow with the Arrow therein, and thus he rideth to the place of Circumciſion, curſing his father that begate him, and and his mother that bore him, his Country, and all his kindred: then comming to the place of Circumciſion, he is Circumciſed, receiuing a name, &amp; denying his Chriſtian name, ſo that euer after he is called a <hi>Runagado,</hi> that is, a Chriſtian denying Chriſt and turned Turke: of which ſort there are more in Turkie and Barbary then of naturall Turkes. The manner of their iudgement for offending of the Law touching death, eyther for theft or murther, is thus: within foure houres after he is taken, he is condemned by certaine chiefe Souldiers, and preſently put to death after this manner, <hi>viz.</hi> ganſhed, ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aked or beat to death. Their ganſhing is after this manner: He ſitteth vpon a wall, being fiue fadomes high, within two fadomes of the top of the wall, right vnder the place where he ſits, is a ſtrong Iron hooke faſtned, being very ſharpe, then is he thruſt off the wall vpon this hooke with ſome part of his bodie, and there he hangeth ſometimes two or thrée daies before he dieth. Staking to death is thus: Around péece of wood thrée yards long, and as big as a mans leg, being ſharpe at one end, is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and driuen in at the fundament of the offender, and out at his ſhoulder, and ſo they let him lie till he be dead, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times will not be in a day or two. The manner of beating to death is thus: They take the offender, and lay him down vpon his backe, being naked, and with two double ropes, two ſeuerall men, one on the one ſide, and the other on the other ſide of him, beate on his belly till he is dead. But theſe deaths are very ſeldome vſed, becauſe they are ſo fearefull to the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, yet I haue ſéene them all executed.</p>

I told him my father was a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and for my part I had ſerued my Quéene by Lano and by Sea, againſt the aduerſaries of my Quéene and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and had loſt mine owne bloud, and ſpilt my enemies bloud: and next that I was a Gentleman by Art. Then the Duke anſwered and ſaid: Thou art a worthy fellow, for thou haſt indured much miſerie in this world. But tell me, quoth hée, with what ſubſtance of wealth cameſt thou out of thy Countrey: I anſwered with two purſes full: Full ſaid hée, of what? I ſaid of Siluer and Gold, which I loſt when I was taken by his Highnes Gallies, and the other full of Patience, which doth continue full ſtill: Then ſaid the Duke to one that ſtoode by, giue him a hundred Crownes to ſpend to ſtrengthen himſelfe, and bring himſelfe to courage; thus did the Duke take delight in diſcourſing with me, in reſpect I ſpake the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talian tongue very perfectly, for I bought it déere, with many a droppe of my bloud, in the time of my ſlauerie. Then receiuing this hundred Crownes, which the Duke had giuen me, I left his Court, comming preſently to <hi>Ligorne,</hi> where the Ship lay, indeauoring of my ſelfe, by my labour, and induſtrie, for the fitting of all things neceſſary for the good of the Uoyage, vpon the Dukes charge, beſides this hundred Crownes: for they were giuen mée to ſpend at my owne pleaſure, which I did, to the comfort of many Engliſh-men that lay in chaines, that were taken with mée: they wanted neyther meate nor drinke as long as my money laſted, as many of them as were left a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue, for of ſeuen and thirtie of vs that were taken at the firſt, there remayned then but thirtéene, whereof tenne continued in chaines, and two were deliuered with me. By this time


<pb facs="tcp:9909:11"/>
all things were prepared and made readie for the performance of our pretended Uoyage, now being bound to ſerue in the good Ship called the <hi>Santa Lucia,</hi> with a Frigot, and a Tartane, well victualled, and well manned, and chiefely bound to the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of <hi>Amazones,</hi> with other ſeuerall Riuers, the which the Duke would haue inhabited, hoping for great ſtore of gaine of Gold, but the Countries did affoord no ſuch thing, as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after ſhall be ſpoken of. Upon this Uoyage we were foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>téene moneths, making little gaine, or benefit for the Duke, for there was nothing to be gained. Now are we homewards bound, and recouering the ſtraits againe, &amp; being within three or foure dayes ſayle of our owne Port, <hi>Ligorne:</hi> in the night ſeaſon we met with an Engliſh Pirate, who would haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vs, but was not able, yet held vs fight all the whole night, and kild vs a man, and hurt other two: whereof one was an Engliſhman, who died within two dayes after we recouered <hi>Ligorne,</hi> and being dead I went to the Captaine and demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of him where he ſhould be buried, but he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I intreated the company of many Engliſhmen that were Proteſtants to helpe me to ſhroud him, and alſo to accompany me to the burying of him, which they did in this manner. We put him vpon a Beare, being ſhrowded with a couering ouer him, and carried by foure men, many Engliſhmen that were Proteſtants followed him, bearing euery man a branch of Roſemary in his hand to the place where we buried him, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Prayers ouer him after the Engliſh manner.

Therefore take him, and put him into the ſecret, whither vnto I was brought, which is a priſon in this manner: Many double doores being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, I paſſed through two or thrée outward priſons then comming to the doore of the ſecret, whereinto I was thruſt, it was ſo darke that I could ſée no part of my body, then féeling round about me with my hands, I found it to be very ſhort in length, &amp; leſſe in breadth, but of height I know not how high, becauſe I could neither ſée nor féele the top. In this place I was almoſt ouer ſhoes in the filth of other men that had died there before, who neuer liued aboue eight or ten daies there at the moſt: Then wrapping one arme within another, and leaning againſt the wall, calling to minde <hi>Iobs</hi> miſeries and <hi>Daniels</hi> afflictions amidſt the Lions, and incouraging my ſelfe in Gods mercy, ſung a Pſalme very chéerefully to the praiſe and glory of God, wherein I was greatly comforted. Then did I draw off my ſhoes and ſtockings, &amp; with my bare féete ſwept all the traſh and filth into one corner. In this manner I liued fortie houres before any ſléepe poſſeſt me, and then being deſirous of ſléepe, I ſate downe and leaned my head againſt the wall, and ſlept very ſoundly, being altogether comforted with a liuely hope in the Almighty God, that he would deliuer me (according to my truſt) as he had done before. And when moſt extreames

Then was I brought before the high In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitioner, who demanded of me, whether he that I buried had receiued the Sacrament &amp; confeſt, according to the Romane or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or no, I anſwered no; he was a good Chriſtian, but receiued not the Sacrament, nor was not confeſt, after the order of <hi>Rome:</hi> then he ſaid that he was, by a Frier of the <hi>Meſericordia,</hi> &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou ſhalt be burned. Then I intreated that I might but ſpeake, and he ſaid ſpeake on: then I aſked them this, whether the Frier that confeſt him could ſpeak any Engliſh or no, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered that he could ſpeake none: then tell me quoth I, how an Italian Frier (can confeſſe an Engliſhman ſpeaking no En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, nor the Engliſhman ſpeaking no Italian, nor other lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage but his mother tongue? for you know wel there muſt be no interpreter in confeſſion, &amp; if the Sacrament were miniſtred vnto him, the houſe where he died can iuſtifie it. Then the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitioner hearing this, ſcratched his head, ſaying, this fellow hath ſpoken the truth, wherfore take him and put him out into a large priſon, whether I was brought, where I liued ten wéeks being well, and often relieued by Engliſh Proteſtants, who reioyced much to ſee me aliue.

With that he was very ſorely grieued, in reſpect he knew my brother very well, and loued him directly, and told me if all the meanes that he could vſe could deliuer me, he would: therefore ſaid hée, thinke with your ſelfe, how I may deliuer you, and I will be backe againe with you with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in theſe two or thrée houres: whereupon he deliuered me ſixe Crownes, and bid me ſpare for no money, for he knew my brother would repay it againe: then leauing me, I ſate downe and leaned my head vpon my hand, ſetting my elbow vpon my knée, intreating my Almightie God, to ſhew me ſome direct courſe whereby I ſhould be deliuered. Then preſently came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my head, to ſend for a Frenchman, in whoſe houſe I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies layne before, who preſently came vnto me, vnto whom I imparted my minde, telling of him that if he would faine a matter of debt againſt me, I would giue him ten Crownes for his labour, though I ought him nothing: but he anſwered and ſaid it was dangerous, for it was a Gally-matter, but I vewed it ſhould neuer be made knowne by me: Whereupon he gaue conſent, and went to the Gouernour and told him, that in the Priſon where debters are, there is an Engliſhman who oweth me money, and we were agréed, then ſaid the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſarie if thou art content, let him pay the charge of the houſe, and be gone: which charge I paid preſently, and was fréed, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting away with the Frenchman, and brought him to Maſter <hi>Hunts</hi> houſe, the Engliſh Counſell, where I gaue him his tenne Crownes.

            <p>The Concluſion of the Booke: to the Reader.</p>
            <p>THus farre (gentle Reader) I thought good, out of my ſlender capacitie, to acquaint thée with a briefe and plaine diſcourſe of my Trauell, which though it be rude, as comming from a barren brayne, which profeſſeth nothing leſſe then lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: yet aſſure thy ſelfe it containes vndoubted truth, being no more then I haue ſéene, knowne, and to my griefe and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill felt. And if any, as well or better acquainted with theſe Parts, or any of them, whereof I make mention, diſliking the rudeneſſe of my ſtile, will vndertake to refine it, hée giues me no diſcontent, ſo he derogate not from the truth thereof. And whereas I made promiſe in the beginning of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, in theſe twelue diſcourſes, to touch or ſpeake ſomething of the reſt of the places, ſpecified in the Table, I haue partly performed it: but to haue written of them at large, would haue béene but friuolous and ſuperfluous, partly becauſe they are places of no extraordinary note, but ſpecially becauſe they doe in moſt, or all things, agrée with the Countries to which they are annexed, and tributaries, or vaſſalls: as the Ilands tributary to the Spaniards, follow their manner of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, cuſtomes, and orders. The Turkiſh tributaries imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate them in moſt things: and ſo you may iudge of the reſt, according as they are ſeuerally diſtinguiſhed. And ſo much may ſuffice to cléere that doubt. Now the reaſons that vrged me to publiſh this Booke are manifold, but chiefly three: The firſt was, to keepe in record, and make knowne my owne mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, leſt with the forgetfull Butler in Pharaos Priſon, who being deliuered forgat his promiſe made to <hi>Ioſeph.</hi> that fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told his deliuery: ſo I (ſuch is infirmitie and frailtie of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature) might (cheaked with worldly proſperitie for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get my mercifull and mightie Deliuerer. The ſecond was, that others (warned by my miſery) might ſhun the like. The laſt and chiefeſt reaſon was, to glorifie God, eſpecially heere in England, which aboue all earthly Countries and Nations is moſt bound to extend and ſet forth his glory. For what


<pb facs="tcp:9909:21"/>
Chriſtian, reading but the extreame thraldome and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he hath inflicted vpon the Jewes, euen to this houre, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Nation he had once ſelected to himſelfe from amongſt all the Nations of the earth. Or the preſent miſery of the Gréekes, who once were Monarches of the Earth, and one of the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Churches of Chriſtendome, being the firſt fruits of the Gentiles, whoſe extreame bondage is now lamentable, yet not with the Iſraelites, ſacrificing their children to Idols, but forced to giue as well the tenth of their children, as of their ſubſtance to that monſtrous <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Idoll the Turke. Or who, duly pondering the blindneſſe and obſtinacie of the Spaniards, Pope, and Italians, with the horrible and abſurd ſinnes that God hath giuen them ouer to: Or who, ſéeing the Infidelitie of the ſimple <hi>Indian</hi> (well may I call him ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, becauſe his errour grows more of want of true knowledge then obſtinacie) who worſhips the creature, being ignorant of the Almightie Creator? What Engliſh heart (I ſay) duly pondering theſe things in generall, or any one of theſe things in particular, can otherwiſe chooſe but falling downe on his bended knées, yéeld God immortall and innumerable thanks and prayſe-giuing, not onely for electing him aboue all other Nations of the Earth, to the true and perfect knowledge of his bleſſed Goſpell, but alſo for preſeruing him ſo long from ſo many miſeries and wretched thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, whereunto moſt Nations of the Earth are ſubiect?</p>
