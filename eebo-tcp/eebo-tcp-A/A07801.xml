            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <note n="o" place="margin">B. Iewel.</note>
               <hi>to place holinesse, so it is to place vnholinesse in them.</hi> To conclude. This doctrine is <note n="p" place="margin">Caluin.</note>
               <hi>Contrary to the intention of Christ,</hi> and to the <note n="q" place="margin">B. Iewell, P. Martyr.</note> 
               <hi>Libertie of the Church of Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The last, which is of <hi>Not vsing any bodily reuerence at the holy Communion,</hi> Thus, <note n="r" place="margin">Caluin, B. Iewel, Zan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, Zepper. P. Martyr.</note> 
               <hi>Outward reuerence is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite in Communicants, both for the dignifying of Christs mysteries, and for the increase of our Christian deuotion.</hi> In a word, to deny the Church power, to choose her gesture of <hi>Reuerence,</hi> is <note n="s" place="margin">Bucer, P.

               <hi>Contrary to the libertie allowed her by Christ.</hi> All these, with diuerse other authorities and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, are more expresly mentioned in the Treatise it selfe.</p>
            <p>If you desire not to take vp your ware by retaile, you may haue it in a generalitie. For, to instance but in one <hi>Ceremonie,</hi> (be it the <hi>Surplice)</hi> the Reformed Churches, although they vsed it not, yet did they so certainly iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie our practise thereof, that (as it is confessed) <note n="t" place="margin">P.

               <hi>We shall condemne all Churches of impious boldnesse.</hi> Not to returne vpon you the many <hi>Parlaments,</hi> and <hi>Conuocations,</hi> which (by the generall consent of the learnedst Diuines, and the most wise and religious Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours in this kingdome) haue established these Rites.</p>
            <p>Before I shut vp this Epistle, let me acquaint you with some other of your errors, which may chiefly require your <hi>second thoughts.</hi> I shal need but only to point at the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:13224:5"/>One is, your often alleaging of <hi>Scriptures, Fathers,</hi> and other <hi>Authors</hi>; and your open mistaking of their meanings, as will euidently appeare.</p>
            <p>The next, is, the many Repugnancies vnto your selues, by such an extreme difference betweene your <hi>Swearing,</hi> and <hi>Praying</hi>; your <hi>standing,</hi> and <hi>sitting</hi>; your <hi>hands,</hi> and <hi>tongues</hi>; your <hi>heads,</hi> and your <hi>knees, &amp;c.</hi> as if there were some mile distance betweene you, and your selu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, which make against your owne conclusions.</p>
            <p>The third is, the extreme iniurie that you do vnto the Church. But you pretend peace; because, forsooth, you preach not against <hi>Conformitie.</hi> As though there were not a Preaching as well in the <hi>eare,</hi> as <hi>on the house-top</hi>; or not as well an exemplarie, as there is an oratorie seduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: else could not Saint <hi>Paul</hi> haue said,<note place="margin">Gal. 2.14.</note> concerning onely the Exemplarie; <hi>Cogis eos Iudaizare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that which herein doth double your offence, is, that your opposition is grounded vpon a sinister conceit, that our Church obserueth these <hi>Ceremonies</hi> in an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Holinesse</hi> and <hi>Necessitie</hi>: which is altogether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to her owne expresse protestation. Howbeit, if her meaning in this case were but ambiguous, or doubtfull, yet would wel-conditioned children take things from a Parent with their right hands: but your deprauing of her professed and plaine doctrine, what can it else argue in you, then an earnest bent to contention, against the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall custome of the Church? not vnlike vnto the <hi>Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pencer,</hi> which vsually swimmeth against the streame.</p>
            <p>The last, is, your notorious <hi>Scandals</hi> giuen vnto them that are without, and them that are within the Church; to the weake, and to the strong; yea and to the Church of God it selfe, by breaking the hedge of peace, and <hi>ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

                     <p>We distinguish. Some points concerning Religion are <hi>Doctrinall,</hi> and some meerely <hi>Ceremoniall.</hi> And we say, that all things which doctrinally belong to salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whether appertaining to faith, or morall conuersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of life, or yet essentiall parts of Gods worship, are sufficiently reuealed in <hi>Scripture:</hi> but as for points meere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ceremoniall (being not the body, but the garment of Religion) they are left to the libertie of the Church. Know therefore, that this Scripture speaketh of <hi>Reals,</hi> and not of <hi>Rituals.</hi> Notwithstanding, if we examine the cause, by due comparison of both, <hi>Christ</hi> will be found in both of these to be as absolute as <hi>Moses</hi> for <hi>faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:13224:13"/>
in Gods house</hi>; yea and to exceede him in perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, as much as his owne glorious bodie, now ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into heauen, doth excell that of <hi>Moses</hi> putrified long since in the earth.</p>

                  <p>First, <hi>Moses</hi> by his bodily Rites did but onely prefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure mans redemption: but <hi>Christ</hi> in his owne bodie performed it in that [<hi>Consummatum est,</hi>] by his sacrifice on the Crosse.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Moses</hi> had a veile ouer his face, and deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Gospell onely in shadowes and mysteries: but <hi>Christ</hi> reuealed the blessed countenance of our gracious God vnto vs by the light of the new Testament; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly publishing our reconciliation with God, by his owne death.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Moses</hi> his office was principally to diuulge the Law deliuered in <hi>Thundering,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>and earthquakes, and a terrible voyce, which made Moses himselfe to quake for feare.</hi> But the Gospell of <hi>Christ</hi> was deliuered with <hi>Hymmes and Songs of Angels,</hi> and promises of sauing <hi>Ioy to all people:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luc. 2.</note> so that the difference betweene <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> is no lesse than <hi>Timor</hi> and <hi>Amor</hi>; feare, and loue.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Moses</hi> notwithstanding he brought to the people the promises of the inheritance of but the earthly <hi>Canaan,</hi> yet he died in the mount, and was not suffered to passe ouer <hi>Iordan</hi>: whereby was signified, that the law of <hi>Commandements</hi> could neuer bring man to possesse the heauenly <hi>Canaan.</hi> But <hi>Christ</hi> being dead, to bring

life to mankind, raised himselfe from death, ascended, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred within the veile, and hath taken possession of the <hi>Celestiall Mansions</hi>; that, where he is, there his faithfull may be also. And thus, in all these respects, <hi>Christ</hi> was <hi>in the house of God</hi> as much, yea and more perfect in <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse</hi> then <hi>Moses.</hi>

                  <p>Come we to the Ceremonials. <hi>Moses</hi> indeed was faithfull to deliuer all the lawes of <hi>Ceremonies</hi> expresly and particularly vnto the Israelites, who were therefore schooled, and exercised with a multitude of Rites, lest they might cast their eyes vpon the ey-pleasing Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who compassed them round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout; and so be inticed to Idolatrie: Yet all that masse of Ceremonies is called by the Apostle <hi>A burthen impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</hi> But <hi>Christ,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. 15 10.</note> howsoeuer he would haue Ceremonies in the Church, yet as for number not manie, so (excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Sacraments, which were of his own institution) for vse not of absolute necessitie; did therefore remoue the law of <hi>Iewish</hi> Ceremonies, &amp; disburdened all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians from the necessited vse of them. And thus also was <hi>Christ faithfull as Moses.</hi> But why do we compare the <hi>seruant of the house</hi> with the <hi>Lord and Sauiour</hi> thereof?<note place="margin">Heb. 3.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for your obiection, concerning <hi>Christ his fidelity</hi> in prescribing of all particular ceremonies, which are not the formall parts of Gods worship, but certaine appur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances thereunto; if (as you seeme) you shall be as willing to subscribe to the iudgement of <hi>M. Caluine,</hi> as you are zealous, from his iudgement, to prescribe vnto
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:13224:14"/>
others, this question will be easily decided. For that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable witnesse hath iudiciously obserued, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though our Lord <hi>Christ</hi> would haue all things compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in the sacred Oracles of Scripture, which are neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to saluation, whether they belong to the doctrine of faith, or to the formall and essentiall parts of his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship: yet, concerning the externall forme of gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">Caluin. Inst. l. 4. c. 10 § 30.</note> and Rites of the Church, <hi>Quià in externa discipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nâ, &amp; ceremonijs non voluit, &amp;c. because Christ</hi> (saith he) <hi>would not prescribe singularly and especially, concerning ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall discipline and Ceremonies, for that he foresaw these things were to depend on the occasions and opportunities of times; nor did he thinke one forme to accord with all ages: hereupon must we haue recourse</hi> (saith M. Caluin) <hi>vnto the generall Rules, that all things (whatsoeuer the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie of the Church shall require) may be tried by them. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally he deliuered nothing expresly in these points, because these things are not of necessitie to saluation, but ought to be accommodated vnto the edification of the Church, according to the different disposition, and custome of times and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</hi> So he, very iudiciously and prudently. Now this is a knowne case, that the old Testament was deliuered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one onely people of the world: but the commission of the Gospell was, <hi>Go into all Nations, and preach.</hi> This nett was to ouerspread the whole world:<note place="margin">Matt. 28.19.

                     <p>The same <hi>Doctor (qui, me mihi prodis? ait)</hi> answereth, that you could not do him greater iniurie, nor your cause more preiudice, than so notoriously to falsifie his direct meaning, in both places.

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:13224:19"/>
iudgement he holds to be in their owne nature indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and not necessarie to saluation) he takes a precise exception against them; and excludes all obiections concerning such Rites, as being aliens from the matter handled in that place.<note place="margin">Apol. part. 2. lib. 2. c 42. pag. 139.</note> For the exact state of the question there is set downe concerning matter of <hi>doctrine</hi> onely: yet for all this our <hi>Non-conformist</hi> will needs not onely leuell at a wrong marke, but also shoote against me with my owne bow, and make me seeme to dispute <hi>negatiuely from Scripture,</hi> touching points meerely <hi>Ceremoniall.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Appeale</hi> doth indeed mention <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> yet not all, but such onely as were inuented and appointed to be essentiall parts of a Sacrament, as namely, <hi>milke</hi> in stead of <hi>wine; sopping in of bread into the cup</hi>; and <hi>wringing in of the grape.</hi> Now all these had in them a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>doctrinals</hi> through an opinion of a necessary vse: For, <hi>sacramentum est verbum visibile; A Sacrament</hi> (as Augustine saith) <hi>is a visible word.</hi> Wherefore, to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine new materiall Elements in the Eucharist, as parts thereof, is, in a manner, to inuent a new Sacrament; which is a sacrilegious deprauation of the will of the Testator Iesus: in which case a Ceremonie <hi>besides</hi> the word, is flatly <hi>against</hi> the word; and such were these. For concerning <hi>taking</hi> of <hi>bread,</hi> and <hi>eating</hi>; and afterwards of <hi>taking the cup,</hi> and <hi>drinking,</hi> Christ doth prefine seuerally, [<hi>Do this</hi>:] where the vse of <hi>milke,</hi> in stead of <hi>wine,</hi> and of <hi>sopping in the bread,</hi> and <hi>eating it,</hi> without <hi>breaking,</hi> are flatly repugnant to the precept of Christ; and consequently can haue no affinitie with our <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,</hi> which are onely held as <hi>circumstantiall</hi> Rites, and no way essentiall parts of any Sacrament, or prescribed forme of Gods worship.

                     <p>But you wil reply, that all <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of mans inuentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are contrary to the <hi>Scripture.</hi> I answere by a briefe distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.

                  <head>SECT. XX. Our fourth proofe is from Reason, taken not onely from the nature of Ceremonies, (according to the common ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of all Diuines:) but also from the different practise of Reformed Churches.</head>
                  <p>You haue said that our <hi>Ceremonies</hi> though they be not <hi>Against</hi> the word, yet because they are <hi>Besides</hi> the

Whence I first argue thus: Nothing can, in respect of God, be called vnlawfull, which is not <hi>Against</hi> the word; because whatsoeuer is vnlawfull is a transgression of some law reuealed in his word: But that which is onely <hi>Besides</hi> the word, is not a transgression of the word.

                  <p n="2">2.

                     <p>In the ordaining of <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> two things come to be considered; the first is in <hi>Thesi,</hi> and generall position, that it be warranted by the word, whether it be by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, or else by permission: and so we might say that the ordinance of <hi>Ceremonies</hi> may be called <hi>Diuine.</hi> The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond consideration is in respect of the <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> and specification of the <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> as prescribing of this, or that gesture, habit, place, or time, and the like points of circumstance agreeable to the seruice of God: these, we say, (in respect of the <hi>permissiue</hi> appointment of <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies</hi>) are from God; but in respect of the specification, and determination of some one sort of <hi>Ceremonie,</hi> rather than another, they may be called <hi>humane.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Againe, that you may better discerne of these termes, take into consultation (if it please you) the aduise of <hi>M.

time or place; and so it is in this Scripture rather <hi>intimated than expressed.</hi> By which rule we are likewise authorized to call some <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of our Church, in a kind of generality, <hi>Diuine,</hi> so far as they haue any depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance vpon that generall directio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                     <p>There is a second Rule of direction, in case of <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,</hi> which is, the <hi>Equitie</hi> of them, that are contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in <hi>Scriptures</hi>; according to the example of <hi>Solomon,</hi> in building his <hi>new Altar</hi> for Sacrifice, besides that one Altar which God himselfe had ordained; whereof one of your owne fellowship confesseth, saying, that <hi>he did it out of the equitie of Moses Law.</hi>

                     <p>All these places of Scripture are meerely <hi>Heteroclits,</hi> in respect of the point in controuersie. For first by the [<hi>Precepts of men</hi>] in <hi>Esay</hi> are signified such <hi>humane</hi> ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, as were expresly contrary to the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, as is plaine both by the description of their sin,<note place="margin">Esay 29. v. 9.</note> called a <hi>staggering drunkennesse</hi> (signifying their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous conceits;) and also by the denunciation of Gods iudgements, by <hi>fearefull destruction to come vpon Israel, by the hands of a multitude of Nations.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Vers. 7.</note> Which kind of menaces were neuer published but for hainous and horrible transgressions.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the <hi>Adding and diminishing</hi> spoken of,<note place="margin">Deut. 12.32.</note> doth not meane <hi>addition</hi> of preseruation, but addition of corruption: like as the fraudulent Coyner of money doth corrupt the Kings Coyne, either by adding baser mettall vnto it, or by clipping any siluer from it, and in both kinds he is a Traitor. How much more high trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son must we iudge it to be against the Highest himselfe, when man shall aduenture, either to make any Diuine precept, or promise, and set Gods stampe vpon it? to make the speech to be Gods speech, which is but the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of his owne forge? or to diminish the estimation of Gods precept, by accounting it but an inuention of man? And the like may be affirmed of the Sacraments, which are proper to that Diuine person, who is the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stator, it being no lesse sacriledge to corrupt the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which are the seales of Gods promises, than to depraue his will of Commandements.</p>

                     <p>The true vnderstanding of the two acceptions of this phrase [<hi>Parts of Gods Worship</hi>] might easily haue rectifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your iudgements; for it is sometimes taken in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours more strictly and properly for that essentiall forme and manner of worship wherein there is placed an opinion of Iustice, Sanctitie, Efficacie, or Diuine ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity: and so we hold it sacrilegious for any Church to impose, or to admit of any such <hi>Ceremonie</hi> proceeding from <hi>humane</hi> institution. Sometimes againe the same phrase is taken more largely, for euery circumstantiall Rite, which serueth for the more consonant and conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient discharge of that essentiall worship of God: and thus we hold it a peece of Christian libertie, belonging to the Church, to ordaine Ceremonies, which may tend to <hi>Decencie, Order,</hi> and <hi>Edification,</hi> as hath bene already shewen, and acknowledged.

where they condemne onely such <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> which are invented by men, and brought into the Church by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists and others, with an opinion of such holinesse, effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie, and necessity, as whereby God is as properly wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped, as with the formes, which he himselfe hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained; thereupon you vrge and inforce them to the confutation of onely <hi>Circumstantiall</hi> and <hi>Accidentall</hi> Additaments, vsed without all such superstitious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect.</p>

                        </gap>ip can be giuen, which may not be predicated of these Rites? For to bee instituted of God (if any shall so answer) doth not vary the common nature of worship, but distinguisheth it into true or false.</p>

                     <p>This is a peece of learning, which (I thinke) neuer saw print, to wit, that the <hi>Institution of God doth not alter the common nature of worship</hi>; because Gods <hi>Institution</hi> doth distinguish necessary worship from the indifferent, and the Essentiall from the Accidentall. For, before the <hi>Leuiticall</hi> Law, the offering of any coloured sheepe, spotted, or vnspotted, was indifferent; but after that the commandement of God had prescribed, that the <hi>Lambe,</hi> which was to be sacrificed vnto him, should be <hi>without spot,</hi> then this <hi>Ceremony</hi> of an <hi>vnspotted Lambe,</hi> became necessary and essentiall in Gods worship. And so we might say of the rest of the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> vnder the <hi>Leui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall</hi> Priesthood. Therefore the commandement of God doth not distinguish onely betweene <hi>True</hi> and <hi>False</hi>; but sometime betweene <hi>Necessary</hi> and <hi>Indifferent,</hi> Essentiall and Accidentall, Diuine and Humane: that, being onely Necessary, Essentiall, and Diuine, without which the worship of God cannot be lawfully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>

                     <p>This your Argument, if it be rightly examined, will not proue so strong, as strange: For to conclude thus; <hi>Many people within the state of this Kingdome do hold these Ceremonies to be necessary parts of Gods worship</hi>: Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, <hi>they are imposed and obserued as necessary parts of Gods worship</hi>: may by as good, or rather better reason, be retorted vpon your selues, thus: <hi>Most people in the Land hold them not to be necessary parts of Gods worship</hi>; Ergo, <hi>they are not imposed as essentiall and necessary parts thereof.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, you ought to haue made a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the iudgement of the Gouernours in imposing, and the opinion (if yet there be any such) of some peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in obseruing of them, as <hi>necessary</hi>: For this your Reason can make no better Logicke, then if one would co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude that <hi>Vsury</hi> (the State not punishing the taking of ten in the 100) iustifiable by the Law of God; because some people make the like collection.

                     <p>And (because you do commonly obiect the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of people) tell vs, in good sadnesse, of what sect you suppose this people to be, that hold the <hi>necessity</hi> of these things?

                  <p>Against their generall Proposition, we haue proued

from their own witnesses, to wit, <hi>Caluin, Chemnitius, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Martyr, Vrsinus,</hi> and <hi>Zanchius,</hi> that onely those Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies are properly made parts of <hi>Gods worship,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the worship of God is said essentially and absolutely to consist. Now we must confute their generall assump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by the expresse profession of our Church, which teacheth, and publisheth to the world, that she doth not either <hi>impose,</hi> or <hi>obserue</hi> any <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> with any opinion of efficacy, holinesse, or necessity, but onely for <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, Order, Edification,</hi> and <hi>Conueniency.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It will become euery childe of the Church to heare his Mothers Apologie for her selfe, in this case: who telleth vs,<note place="margin">Constit &amp;c. Can. 75.

                  <p>This profession of our Church is so manifest vnto her most earnest Opposites,<note place="margin">Abridg.

                     <p>The first Text, <hi>Mar.</hi> 7.8. mentioning <hi>washing of cups,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mar. 7.8.</note> pointeth indeed at a <hi>Mystical Ceremony</hi> of <hi>Humane inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which is there condemned: but how? Not because of the <hi>signification</hi> of a <hi>spirituall duety,</hi> but for the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saicall leauen</hi> of corrupt doctrine taught hereby; for there was in it two ounces of <hi>leauen</hi> at the least: the first was in attributing a legall purification to such their <hi>Wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> thinking thereby to be cleansed from bodily pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, through the touching of the bodies of the dead, and such like; euen as well as by the washings, which God himselfe had appointed, to the same end. Their second errour was in their imputing of a spirituall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and efficacie vnto them, of cleansing their soules from sin, as is manifest by the reproofe which <hi>Christ</hi> vsed against those <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> saying; <hi>That which is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and entreth into man, cannot defile a man,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">V. 28.</note> 
                        <hi>but that which is within and commeth out of the man, that defileth a man.</hi> Therefore this their <hi>washing</hi> was not condemned,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:13224:36"/>
as a meere <hi>Ceremonie,</hi> but for the mixture of a false doctrine, teaching an efficacy and vertue of purification, which it had not.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the second Text, the case standeth thus. The <hi>Pharises</hi> by their <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, that is, <hi>second Traditions,</hi> taught their Disciples a strange peece of <hi>Catechisme,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Corban,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mar. 7.11.</note> to wit, <hi>The gift that shall be offered by me, shall profite thee</hi>: that is, Every voluntary offering, that thou shalt giue to the Temple, or for the benefite of the Priesthood, shall gaine of God a blessing vpon thee, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit thou shouldest neglect thy parents, in withdrawing that <hi>Gift</hi> from their reliefe, in their great necessity. For confutation of this errour, <hi>Christ</hi> opposeth the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, saying: <hi>Moses said</hi> vnto you, that is, (as <hi>S. Matthew</hi> hath it) <hi>God</hi> (namely by <hi>Moses) said,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Marc. 7.10.11. Math. 15.4.</note> 
                        <hi>Thou shalt honour thy Father, &amp;c.

                     <p>S. <hi>Augustine</hi> speaketh of <hi>Phrases of Scripture,</hi> which, when they make for piety and charity, he would not haue expounded <hi>figuratiuely</hi>: but when any sentences do seeme to command any thing that is <hi>Facinerous, hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, and wicked, then</hi> (saith he) <hi>must wee vnderstand them as being figuratiuely spoken.</hi> As for example, that saying of Christ,<note place="margin">Ioh. 6.53.</note> 
                        <hi>Except you eate the flesh of the Sonne of man &amp;c.</hi> which for the same cause must needs receiue a <hi>figuratiue</hi> interpretation.

                        <note place="margin">Aug.</note> If heereby you shall collect that S. <hi>Augustine</hi> will admit of no <hi>Signes</hi> of holy duties, which are not <hi>Sacraments,</hi> then shall you bewray your small acquaintance you haue had with the language of S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> with whom nothing is more frequent or familiar, than to call all <hi>Signes</hi> of any holy thing <hi>Sacraments:</hi> And so by your consequence you shall haue as many <hi>Sacraments,</hi> as there are parts and parcels of parables and similitudes.</p>

                     <p>Our <hi>Ceremonies</hi> are onely <hi>morall signes,</hi> as hath bene said, signifying vnto vs <hi>morall</hi> duties; to wit, the <hi>Surplice</hi> to betoken <hi>Sanctity</hi> of life; the Signing the forehead with the <hi>Crosse, Constancy</hi> in the faith of Christ; and <hi>Knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> at the Communion, our <hi>Humility</hi> in receiuing such pledges of our Redemption by Christ Iesus.</p>
                     <p>As for the <hi>Sacramentall signe.</hi> Euery <hi>Sacrament</hi> hath two significations in in it, the one is, <hi>Ad modum signi,</hi> to represent some spirituall thing: the second is, <hi>Ad mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum sigilli,</hi> to seale an assurance of some diuine promise of Grace.

Therefore these <hi>Mysticall signes,</hi> which we call <hi>Sacramentall,</hi> differ from the <hi>my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall</hi> signes <hi>morall,</hi> both as the <hi>Sacramentall</hi> are <hi>Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant,</hi> by speciall representation; and as they are <hi>obsignant</hi> by ratifying and applying of Gods couenant of Grace vnto vs: as the <hi>Aspersion</hi> of the water in Baptisme is a signe of Remission of sinne conferred vpon the person baptized; and therefore is it proper to God, who onely giueth the thing, to ordaine such a signe. But the <hi>morall</hi> signe doth not represent any Collation of grace giuen by God vnto man, but onely notifieth a duety of man in some morall vertue which he oweth vnto God.</p>
                     <p>Your owne witnesse <hi>Zanchius</hi> hath something to this purpose,<note place="margin">De redempt. pag. 422.</note> saying; <hi>What are Sacraments but Images, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is reuealed and represented vnto vs the grace of God in Christ Iesus, by the remission of sinne, and life euerlasting; whereby there is offered to the minds of receiuers Christ with all the benefits of the Eternall couenant made vnto vs in Christ?</hi> In which respect these Sacraments are rightly called the <hi>Signes</hi> and <hi>Seales of the Couenant of Grace.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>These points thus standing, I could not but wonder at the former <hi>Thesis,</hi> as at a strange Paradox, that maketh <hi>signification</hi> to be the chiefe point of a <hi>Sacrament</hi>: which if wee did maintaine, then <hi>Bellarmine</hi> might haue some colour to insult vpon Protestants by this obiection,<note place="margin">Bellar. lib. 1. De. Euch. c. 11 §. secundo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missa.</note> viz. <hi>If Sacraments be onely signes, then the Crucifix is a better signe, to signifie the death of Christ, than the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</hi> This is his consequence. Will our Non-conformists now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low

him this Assumption, by accounting <hi>a signe</hi> to be a <hi>chiefe part of our Sacraments</hi>? Nay, should they not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inueigh against the impudencie of such Romish Proctors, who vsually impute vnto Protestants do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of their owne deuising? For <hi>Caluine,</hi> whom the Papists in this Answer do especially impugne, hath told them (I thinke I may say an hundred times,) that we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count not our <hi>Sacraments meere signes,</hi> to represent the graces of God; but that they are also <hi>seales,</hi> to present and exhibite the truth of Gods promises of Grace, and to applie them to the hearts of faithfull Receiuers.</p>
                     <p>Let me adde further, for the satisfaction of the more ingenuous, &amp; the conuiction of such as wil be peruerse, (who tell vs that <hi>Signification is a principall part of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament</hi>) that then all the morall signes vsed in the <hi>Leui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall</hi> worship, as namely <hi>Bels, Lauars, Lights, Candlesticks,</hi> and other <hi>Ceremoniall</hi> instruments euen vnto the very <hi>Snuffers</hi> of the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> should (things taking their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the principal parts) be properly deemed <hi>Sacraments.</hi> And the like I may say of abstinence from <hi>Hogges flesh</hi>; from touching of the corpes of the <hi>Dead</hi>; from <hi>Linsey-woolsey</hi> apparrell; and an hundreth such o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, whereby diuerse moralities are signifyed; but no Sacrament implyed.

                     <head>Our Answer.</head>
                     <p>I answer first, that the vse of some (I vnderstand this word in a large acception) Iewish Rite without any Iewish opinion, is not damnable: For how many Christians vnder <hi>Prester Iohn,</hi> are circumcised at this day? yet not <hi>Sacramentally,</hi> that is, in opinion either of the necessity of it; or else <hi>Typically,</hi> as signifying that the <hi>Messias</hi> is to come in the flesh; but onely <hi>Customarily</hi>; and, as it were <hi>Nationally,</hi> for distinction from other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: Or as the <hi>Greeke</hi> Churches anciently vsed the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of Easter, according to the time of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Passeouer, although with a difference both of <hi>Signe</hi> and <hi>Signification.</hi> But more of Iewish Rites hereafter.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, it is far more safe for <hi>Christians</hi> to invent new <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of morall signification, that to vse those old, which had bene appointed by Gods ordinance: not but that the ordinance of God is infinitly to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mans; but both because God, who ordained those <hi>Iewish Ceremonies</hi> for a time, ordained also that they should be abolished in time; as also lest that their vse might ingender an opinion of the necessity of them, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> because they had beene once commanded by God; and consequently might inthrall the minds of men, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine them to a necessary obseruation of the whole <hi>Leviticall</hi> Law: for so the Apostle reasoneth against certaine false Apostles,<note place="margin">Gal. 1.</note> who by their superstitious vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of those <hi>Iewish Ceremonies</hi> sought to bring in againe the ancient bondage of all <hi>Iewish Rites.</hi>

                     <head>Our Answer.</head>
                     <p>What is this you say? That therefore there will be a <hi>gap opened,</hi> 1. <hi>to All others.</hi> 2. to the <hi>Popish.</hi> 3. and for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, to these <hi>Ceremonies</hi> now specified. So many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, and so many errours. For first, to argue from the vse of some few, to an admittance of all other <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies</hi> to like kinde, which are in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> almost innumerable; is a consequence farre more lauish then this: <hi>viz. Some</hi> wise men may be of his Maiesties Priuy Counsell, therefore <hi>All</hi> wise men of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ought to haue place in that Honourable Senate.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Then all Pop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

This conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence I take to bee both <hi>vnreasonable</hi> and <hi>vnconscio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</hi> It is first as <hi>vnreasonable,</hi> as it would be for a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, who, hauing had of his Physitian the Receipts of some Apothecary Drugs, should thereupon presume that it is safe and wholesome for him, to taste of euery boxe in the Apothecary's shop. For it is well knowne, that as there are some good customes in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> so are there many bad.</p>
                     <p>Next, the word <hi>Popish</hi> is here taken of you in the strictest sence, not simply for the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> themselues, but for the mixture of abuses that are in them, by the superstition of that Church. And therefore to conclude from the lawfull vse of <hi>Ceremonies</hi> in our Church, to an appropriation of the <hi>Romish</hi> abuse of them, gaue me iust cause to call your Consequence <hi>vnconscionable</hi>; for as much as your owne hearts can tell you, that our Church is not so earnest to entertaine the vse of any one
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:13224:40"/>
                        <hi>Ceremony,</hi> formerly obserued in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as it is zealous to abhorre her superstition in all her abuses: some of them being Brutish and Sencelesse, some Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish and ridiculous, some Heathenish and Idolatrous; wherby such their Ceremonies respectiuely are become to be most properly <hi>Popish.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, you argue, that if these, <hi>viz. Surplice, Crosse, Knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at the receiuing of the Communion be iustly vsed,</hi> then there is a iust cause that these, to wit, <hi>Oyle, Spittle, Images and the Priests sprinkling of water,</hi> may likewise be had in vse, because all are equally for <hi>Remembrance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We confesse that <hi>Spittle</hi> was vsed by our Sauiour Christ, in the healing of the <hi>Dumbe</hi>; and <hi>Oyle,</hi> by the Apostles, in curing of many other diseases; yet both miraculously: but to imitate the worke of a Miracle, without the Miraculous power, is but an Apish <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>: for to hold such a miraculous <hi>Ceremony,</hi> after the vertue be gone, is but to preserue a Carcase, because it had beene once possessed of a soule.</p>
                     <p>We come to your other Instances in the vse of <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> and that which they call <hi>Holy-water,</hi> to the end that you may the better discerne your owne iniurious and odious comparison. For first, the true vse of Images with vs is onely for <hi>Historicall commemoration</hi>; but in the <hi>Popish Church</hi> it is for a superstitious adoration, by <hi>knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> vnto them, praying by them, and by determinating a kinde of religious worship in them; and therefore one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in regard of such their superstition, is to bee called <hi>Popish.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The second, which is their <hi>sprinkling of water vpon the people, for remembrance of their Baptisme,</hi> if it were applyed onely for to make them often mindfull and careful to keep their <hi>Vow of Christianity,</hi> made once vnto
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:13224:40"/>
God in <hi>Baptisme,</hi> it might be called a <hi>Morall Ceremony,</hi> and Christian: But that <hi>sprinkling of water,</hi> as it is vsed in the <hi>Romish</hi> Church, not onely as <hi>significatiue,</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so as <hi>operatiue,</hi> with an opinion that it hath power, both of <hi>purging veniall sinnes,</hi> and of <hi>driuing away deuils,</hi> is in that regard also Popish &amp; execrable. For what is this else but to take vpon her to constitute a new Sacrament, seeing that a <hi>Sacrament</hi> is a signe of representing, and of exhibiting and conferring of a spirituall Grace? Shee therefore, who hath made the profession of the definite number of but <hi>Seuen Sacraments,</hi> an Article of Faith, hath by this new inuention of <hi>Holy-water</hi> made vp <hi>Eight.</hi>

                        <hi>Neither may you say vnto mee</hi> (saith <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> speaking of the vse of the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice) <hi>there shall be now a gap open for all abuses; to water sprinkled by the Priests, Incense, and infinite such other abuses: because your Aduersaries will answer you, that there must a meane be kept, that the Church of God be not burthened with these kind of things, and that no worship or efficacie of Religion be placed in them, as we see there is in that water-sprinkling and Incense &amp;c.</hi> So he. And do you not furthermore see, by happy experience, that <hi>Open gappe</hi> of many <hi>Ceremonis,</hi> whereof you spake, to be now through the wisedome and prouidence of our Church, quite shut vp, seeing that she is conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to admit of so few, and no more?</p>
                     <p>Lastly, you can with as little reason diuest a Church Christian of her liberty and power of ordaining of <hi>sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant Ceremonies,</hi> because it is possible that she may

abuse that power, by instituting vnfit, superstitious, and burthensome Rites; as it were to seeke to depriue a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill Magistrate of all power of <hi>Nomotheticall</hi> authority, in making of lawes, because there is a possibility he may abuse them.

                     <head>Our Replie.</head>
                     <p>The point then in question is, whether it were not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially for a spirituall vse, whereof we cannot better be resolued than by the whole current and maine scope of the Storie; which doth apparently euince, that it was for a religious <hi>mysticall signification,</hi> albeit not of <hi>Christ and his graces,</hi> yet of spirituall blessings and morall du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: So though it were not erected for the same vse, whereunto the <hi>Altar,</hi> that God appointed, was appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, yet was it ordained for a representation thereof. Let vs consult with the Text it selfe, to the end that wee may answer your <hi>Maior Proposition,</hi> euen <hi>in terminis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Your Dispute is of <hi>humane Ceremonies</hi>; and this was so <hi>humane,</hi> that it was ordained by man, without any speciall warrant from God. And this is very plaine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause these <hi>Gileadites,</hi> when they were to satisfie their brethren (who at the first iudged the building of this <hi>Altar</hi> to be a detestable, and an abominable transgr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

against God) did not replie, that God had commanded them so to do, but answered very ingenuously, saying, <hi>We haue done this, &amp;c.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ver. 24.</note> And againe (imputing it to their own proper motion) <hi>Therefore said we, Let vs build vs, &amp;c.</hi> whence it is euidently apparent,<note place="margin">Ver. 26.</note> that this act proceeded meerely from their owne reason, without any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar direction from God.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, your proposition requireth, that the <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies</hi> be appointed <hi>to Gods seruice</hi>: and so was this <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi> although not to sacrifice thereon; yet (as the Text speaketh) for <hi>A patterne of the Altar of the Lord,</hi> vpon which Gods people did sacrifice. As wee account the <hi>Crosse in Baptisme</hi> not to bee the very <hi>Crosse of Christ,</hi> (whereupon he offered that great sacrifice of Mans re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption) but onely a kind of resemblance thereof. Now, an <hi>Altar</hi> of sacrifice being one of the supreme in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments of Gods immediate worship; that other, which was a resemblance thereof, doublesse, cannot bee said to haue beene onely of a <hi>ciuill vse.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, your proposition mentioneth <hi>Ceremonies of mysticall signification,</hi> to teach any spirituall dutie; Euen as againe wee say, that the <hi>Crosse</hi> in Baptisme is vsed in the way of protestation of <hi>Christian</hi> courage, in the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall conflict against the whole world of Infidels. Here also, I thinke, this very Text doth sufficiently warrant such <hi>mysticall signification:</hi> for seeing all actions borrow their forme and essence from the end, whereunto they are intended, and that these <hi>Gileadites,</hi> in this act of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in vnitie of Religion, did not so much intend to make knowen their interest in the temporal inheritance, as in the spirituall priuiledges of Gods chosen people: This doth necessarily argue, that this <hi>Altar</hi> was not set vp so much for any ciuill vse, as for a <hi>mysticall</hi> resembla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce:
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:13224:45"/>
which is manifest in the Story, where the vse of this <hi>Altar</hi> is expressed thus; <hi>The Altar is called Ed</hi> (that is, witnesse) <hi>for it shall bee a witnesse betweene vs,</hi>

                        <hi>that the Lord is God.</hi> Therefore the end was, that thereby they hauing relation to the other <hi>Altar of God,</hi> might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test and publish their ioynt faith and seruice, with all other Israelites, to the onely true God. And as this end did concerne themselues, so there was yet another end that did respect their posterity; and in this regard they made the <hi>Altar Prolepticall,</hi> for to preuent an obiection, that might afterward arise betweene these <hi>Gileadites,</hi> and their brethren on the other side of Iordan, namely, to this effect: <hi>What haue you to do do with the God of Israel? You haue no part with the Lord:</hi> And so might haue made them ceasse from seruing the Lord; <hi>Therefore</hi> (say the <hi>Gileadites) haue we built this Altar.</hi> You see then, that the <hi>Altar</hi> being a <hi>Patterne</hi> of the <hi>Altar of the Lord,</hi> was a Religious Instrument; and of the <hi>Altar of sacrificing,</hi> a Religious Act; and that to testifie both for them and their posteritie a publicke consent in the true Religion and worship of God, which was a most religious end; And also this, to auow the profession of their Religion, which maketh <hi>it a morall signe,</hi> of a <hi>reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious signification.</hi> How therefore can any be so dimme-sighted, as not to discerne any other thing herein, except onelie a Ciuill vse?</p>
                     <p>The matter standing thus, we may guesse with what indignation and displeasure you would haue entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this answer, by inueighing against that their <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane inuention,</hi> as the daughter of blind Deuotion, in themselues, and mother of Idolatry to their posterity; and by charging them, concerning that <hi>Altar,</hi> and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aloud, <hi>Downe with it, Down with it euen to the ground</hi>;

                     <p>This second Answer, first, ouerthwarts the former: for if <hi>Salomon</hi> did collect the lawfulnesse of this Act, by reasoning from the <hi>Equity</hi> thereof, not particularly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, but generally implyed in the Law of God; then came it not by <hi>extraordinary inspiration.</hi> And secondly, this Answer doth yeeld vnto vs an Answer against all your owne obiections: because hereby you plainely confesse, than an <hi>Humane</hi> collection, deduced from the <hi>equity of Gods Law,</hi> (consisting in the application of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall doctrines and documents, vnto some singular and indiuiduall acts) is lawfull in it selfe: from whence it doth follow, that our <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> instituted to signifie spirituall duties, haue as good <hi>equity</hi> by the Word, as this <hi>Altar</hi> of <hi>Salomon</hi> could haue. Wherefore the rule of <hi>equity,</hi> which you mention, will (as it ought) beare a great sway in this case of Ceremonies, if we may borrow our <hi>equity,</hi> either from the generall <hi>Permissions,</hi> or particular <hi>Examples</hi> of the new Testament.</p>

                     <p>I would you had leasure to looke more directly vpon the Text alledged, where we do not finde that <hi>God appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the Temple of Salomon,</hi> by any <hi>visible</hi> appearance, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> was ended; whereas this second <hi>Altar</hi> was ordained by <hi>Salomon,</hi> before any sacrifice was begun on the former. Whereupon (if we shall take your An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer for true) it must needs follow, that <hi>God approued of the Altar,</hi> before that he did approue of it. Secondly, the words of <hi>Dauid, which</hi> (you say) <hi>do seeme to confirme</hi> the point, are these: <hi>All this the Lord made me vnderstand in writing by his hand vpon me,</hi>

women</hi> (saith he) <hi>might not onely hide their heads, with a couer, but also shadow their faces, by the hanging downe of their haire.</hi> And not onely so, but the Apostle requireth yet another <hi>couer</hi> besides that of the haire, saying of the <hi>vncouered head.</hi> (v. 5) <hi>It is all one as to be shauen</hi>: so then this must needs be a <hi>mystical signe</hi> of <hi>moral duty</hi>; which is here specified to be of the Christian <hi>subiection</hi> that women owe, in <hi>Christ,</hi> vnto their <hi>husbands.</hi> Now heere you may not say, that this ordinance of the Apostle, touching <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering</hi> in the Church, was no way of <hi>humane,</hi> but alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether of <hi>Diuine</hi> Institution; for then might you chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge that women, at this day, in the time of Diuine worship, should haue their haire still hang downe, to couer their faces.</p>
                  <p>This point is of some moment, and may not sleight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be passed ouer. Wherefore, that you may be satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not so much from my collections, as from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of those witnesses on whom you most relie, I haue thought it fit to produce such as haue more particularly pointed out this Text, as namely, <hi>Caluin, Chemnitius, P. Martyr,</hi> and <hi>Zanchius.</hi> From these I would first learne, whether this <hi>Ceremony of couering</hi> the head of the <hi>wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> &amp; <hi>vncouering of the man,</hi> were not <hi>mysticall</hi> &amp; <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolicall,</hi> that is; significant of some good thing, or no? M. <hi>Caluin,</hi> and some others call them expresly <hi>Symbola,</hi> or <hi>Signes.</hi> Secondly, I would aske what thing it is, which is hereby signified; and whether it were not some Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian dutie? And vpon due search it appeareth, that the things, signified by this <hi>Ceremony,</hi> are two; The first, in respect of the <hi>man</hi> and <hi>woman</hi> mutually betweene them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues; and the next, of <hi>man</hi> vnto <hi>God.</hi> Concerning the reciprocall duties betweene man and woman, these wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses affirme that the <hi>Couer, on the head of the woman,</hi> did

betoken <hi>her subiection to the man</hi>; and <hi>the vncouering of the mans head did signifie the Soueraignty that man hath ouer the woman.</hi> But this you interpret to hold onely in a <hi>Ciuill respect</hi>: If so, then would it suffice to iustifie the Ring in marriage; yet look into the second point, which is, the relation it had vnto <hi>God,</hi> and there you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue something more.

inward worship.</hi> Than the which I doe not see, what any Diuine could haue spoken more directly for our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
                  <p>Our third demand is, whether these Ceremonies, <hi>of couering</hi> and <hi>vncouering,</hi> were not instituted to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in <hi>Gods</hi> publike worship? For howsoeuer this Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome might sometime alter in Ciuill assemblies, and much more in priuate consort betwixt man and wife; yet neuerthelesse the Apostle doth most strictly chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge it, in the publike seruice of God: for,<note place="margin">Martyr quo sup p. 50.6.</note> 
                     <hi>Euery man</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>praying or prophesying, &amp;c.</hi> And for better demonstration he doth in a manner call the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels to witnesse, exacting that <hi>Ceremonie [propter An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelos,] in regard of the Angels.</hi> For as the <hi>Angels</hi> are appointed to be <hi>ministring spirits</hi> euery where, for the good of the Elect, euen so are they in very speciall wise attendant at publike Assemblies, for Gods worship. As for the Custome it selfe, <hi>Chrysostome</hi> vseth this excellent <hi>Simile,</hi> for the illustration thereof.<note place="margin">Chrysost.</note> 
                     <hi>When</hi> (saith he) <hi>the King sitteth in his publike Chaire of Estate, and there resort vnto him Dukes, Counts, Tribunes, &amp;c. and none of these present themselues before the King without their robes of honor, according vnto their degrees: so God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing present in his royall maiestie, [in sacro coetu] in the holy assembly; men and women coming thither ought to be ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with such ensignes, as may best declare their state &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Therefore may not that man, who hath receiued from God a diademe of honour &amp; prerogatiue ouer his wife, at that time cast away his ornament, &amp; take vpon him some seruile habit.</hi> Wherby you see, that this <hi>Symbol</hi> was then as well applyed vnto all holy worship, as now our gesture of <hi>kneeling</hi> is, at the participation of the Lords Supper.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, we desire to know, whether this matter
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:13224:53"/>
were not a thing indifferent; and thereupon (albeit <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolicall,</hi> yet) subiect to alteration, according to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie of occasions? This we may best vnderstand from the first originall thereof. <hi>The Apostle</hi> (saith Master <hi>Caluin) tooke it from the common custome of men in their times</hi>;<note place="margin">Caluin.</note> 
                     <hi>which custome in many countreys was otherwise</hi>; yea <hi>anciently euery where [viri comati erant</hi>:] that is, <hi>men had long haire.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Chem. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am. par. 1. p. 75</note> 
                     <hi>Chemnitius</hi> saith, to the same purpose, that <hi>Christian libertie did moderate the Apostles Rites, to make them in their kind indifferent, &amp;c. —which according to the diuers natures of times, places, and persons might bee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, changed, or abrogated. —for in the dayes of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle this custome, of the womens couer, was a signe of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection; and of the man vncouered, a token of dominion and gouernment: but now in our times the fashion is quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; for in these dayes the vncouering of the head is a note of subiection, and the couering is a testimony of authoritie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, it is worthy our Inquiry, to learne, how farre other Churches may be directed by this example of the Apostles <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> for the authorizing of their Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions in like cases? Herein <hi>P. Martyr</hi> is bold, and saith: <hi>The Church of God is an Assembly of the faithfull,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Loc. Theol. Tract. de Tradit p. 720.</note>

                  <p>Here I need not. make any recapitulation of these seuerall points, the indifferent Reader may easily finde in the confession of the fore-named witnesses; 1. That these are things indifferent. 2. That they were prescribed as fit for those times. 3. That consequently they were to be dutifully obserued. 4. That they were <hi>Symbolicall,</hi> and had in them <hi>significations</hi> of <hi>morall</hi> duties. 5.

                  <p>I shall not need to seeke euidence out of Stories, in this behalfe; the Non-conformists themselues are not ignorant hereof, who (besides many other Instances) do, as often as they see occasion, againe, and againe, repeate the custome vniversally vsed in the Churches through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the world, to wit, of <hi>Standing</hi> in the time of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke prayers, in all the Lords daies betweene <hi>Easter</hi> and <hi>Pentecost</hi>; whereby the primitiue Fathers did signifie their faith of <hi>Christ his Resurrection.</hi> If this were a <hi>Diuine Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony</hi> why do you not obserue it?

Wee grant that God had wrought by the <hi>Serpent</hi> a miraculous safety to his people, by deliuering them from the stings of fiery Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents; and that for this very cause it was, as some thinke, long after reserued in some part of the Temple, for the remembrance of so great a benefite; euen as the <hi>Pot of Manna,</hi> and <hi>Aarons Rod</hi> were kept in the Arke, to the like end. But when the Israelites began to defile it, by offering <hi>Incense</hi> vnto it, then did <hi>Ezekias</hi> demolish it; and that for foure speciall respects.</p>
                     <p>The first was, because there was now <hi>Flagrans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lictum,</hi> that is, that Idolatry was notorious, and in the heate.

without any iust exception against them: yet <hi>Sacrificing</hi> is an externall act, so properly and essentially belonging vnto God, that euery eye which beholdeth such Acts, must needs iudge them <hi>Idolatrous.</hi> Lastly, the case was now desperate, and (without vtter extirpation thereof) past all hope of reducing that figure to the former vse and end, which was a co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>But if that proceeding of <hi>Ezekias,</hi> concerning those
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:13224:63"/>
Israelites, against Heathenish Idolatry, shall be still vrged vpon our Magistrates, in respect of the <hi>Popish Ceremonies,</hi> wherewith they may seeme to symbolize, although but in an outward appearance onely; then are you to be informed of the manifest disparities in this comparison.</p>
                     <p>First, that <hi>Idolatry</hi> of the Iewes being done both pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely and generally, and also within the bowels of the same Church (for the <hi>Serpent</hi> was then kept at <hi>Hierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>) called for an <hi>Ezekias</hi> to remoue it. But that which is done of Papists, is in a Church separated from vs; or if you will suppose any to be Idolatrous among vs, yet is that neither generall nor publique, but so secret, that it is done by you know not whom; vnlesse you meane certaine men moulded in your owne fancies, and onely imagined to haue committed such <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The second distance may be this; that the case of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the Idolatry committed vnder the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Ezekias,</hi> became desperate, and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired an answerable remedie; which, as then the case stood, could be no other, then to <hi>abolish</hi> the figure with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay. But within the Kingdomes of our <hi>Ezekias</hi> this disease would be found curable, without any such extremity, especially in this our most truely reformed Church, wherein we draw the sweet breath of the pure truth of God: If you will allow that to be called a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Church,</hi> which doth most liuely expresse the face and full body of her primitiue mother-Church.</p>
                     <p>I spare to insist vpon the grossenesse of that outward fact, which was, <hi>Offering Incense</hi>; lest the weakenesse of some Reader may suspect, that when I would excuse the <hi>Papists, à Tanto,</hi> I would free them <hi>à Toto crimine,</hi> by these comparisons.</p>

                     <p>First, the <hi>Act</hi> was <hi>Sacrifizing</hi> and <hi>offering</hi> vp of <hi>cakes,</hi> which is an Act so properly belonging vnto the Diuine Maiestie, that whereas <hi>Bowing</hi> the body, and falling on the knees, (as hath beene partly signified already) are lawfully giuen in dutifull reuerence vnto Parents by chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and vnto Princes by subiects: yet the very out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Sacrifizing</hi> cannot be done to any man, <hi>Saint,</hi> or <hi>Angel,</hi> without a visible Profession of <hi>Idolatrie.</hi> Secondly, the <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And (which is the third point) we know that the very office of Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, much more that of <hi>Sacrifizing,</hi> is flatly denyed to that Sexe. So that I may iustly call this your Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son friuolous; did it not better deserue to be termed ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnious, first, inasmuch as you indeauour to controll the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> appointed by the deliberate aduice of the religious Gouernours of our Church, and to confute them, by obiecting <hi>Ceremonies</hi> deuised by priuate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, in their clanculary meetings, according to their rude fancies.</p>

                     <head>Our Answer.</head>
                     <p>First, you cannot be ignorant, how that there was a time, when it was lawfull for some <hi>Christians</hi> to keepe the Feast of <hi>Easter</hi> the very same day, wherein it was ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated of the <hi>Iewes.</hi> For your Authour, whom you alleage,<note place="margin">Euseb. hist. Eccl. l. 5. c. 22.</note> doth fully relate that <hi>All the Churches in Asia according to their old custome, did celebrate the Feast of Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster the</hi> 14. <hi>of the Moone, which was the very day, wherein the Iewes were commanded to solemnize their Passeouer.</hi> Then he bringeth in that famous Bishop <hi>Polycrates</hi>; mentioning <hi>Polycarpus, Thraseus, Sagarus,</hi> all Bishops and holy Martyrs; besides <hi>Papyrius, Melito,</hi> and <hi>seuen</hi> other <hi>Bishops</hi> of his owne kindred, who by ancient Tradition, did all obserue the <hi>Iewes</hi> festiuall day of <hi>Easter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="118" facs="tcp:13224:70"/>Secondly, afterwards it was decreed by the <hi>Councell of Nice,</hi> that <hi>Easter</hi> should be celebrated (as you haue tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alleaged) differently from the custome of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> but yet you haue omitted the causes there specified by <hi>Eusebius:</hi> whereof one was the hatred of the <hi>Christians</hi> against the <hi>Iewes, who had defiled their hands with the bloud of the Son of God, and remained still inthralled in the blindnesse and madnesse of their errour.</hi> Another reason was, because of the <hi>insolent</hi> insultation that the <hi>Iewes</hi> then made vpon the <hi>Christians, as though that Christians could not haue kept any obseruation of that feast [sine ipso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum disciplinae subsidio:] without the helpe of their disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.</hi> A third reason there mentioned, is, that by vnifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of this one custome, they might bring the <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Churches</hi> vnto vnitie, which by diuersitie of opinions, concerning the time of the obseruation of the same feast, had been distracted into contrarie factions.</p>
                     <p>These were the principall Reasons which moued the Fathers of that <hi>Councell,</hi> to alter the <hi>Iewish</hi> Feast of <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> and to translate it vnto our <hi>Lords day</hi>; not absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (as you pretend) for the auoiding of all resemblance that it had with the <hi>Iewish</hi> custome (for then must they haue condemned all the godlie Byshops, and holie Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs of <hi>Asia,</hi> who obserued the same time of <hi>Easter</hi> with the <hi>Iewes)</hi> but because of the after-obstinacie and inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> vpbraiding the <hi>Christians</hi> for imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of them vpon an opinion of <hi>necessity</hi>; and also for the reducing of Christian Churches, agreeing in one faith, vnto an vnity of one affection.</p>
                     <p>You see then that the comparing (as commonly you haue done) the practise of Churches in admitting, or reiecting of <hi>Iewish,</hi> or <hi>Heathenish customes,</hi> without their speciall Reasons, is no better discretion, than if you
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:13224:70"/>
would argue some men to be wiser than others, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring their bodies together, without any regard of their reasonable soules. Otherwise you might haue ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily perceiued, that neither we can haue like cause of hatred against <hi>Papists,</hi> (who are professed Christians) as they had against the obstinate <hi>Iewes,</hi> the murtherers of the Lord of glory; nor yet the <hi>Papists</hi> the like cause of insultation against our Church, for imitation of them; seeing that she holdeth none of their Rites, without a professed difference, of opinion and with a detestation of their superstition.</p>

This distinction is made sensible in the diuers vse of Churches, the destinate pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of publike worship; which, in Poperie, were applied vnto an Idolatrous seruice, by their Masse: but the same Churches, being by vs sanctified vnto the sincere wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God, are as truely not the same in the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall forme; as in the Artificiall fabrique and fashion they are the same.</p>

                  <head>SECT. XXIIII. Our second Proofe is from the iudgement of ancient Fathers.</head>
                  <p>The Fathers did not alwayes abolish such <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> as had beene formerly abused, for they (as your selues know) did for a long time continue the <hi>Iewish Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Ester,</hi> obserued by the godly Bishops and Martyrs of the Churches of <hi>Asia,</hi> albeit, not Iewishly, that is, to the same end, whereunto the Iewes did celebrate it. Yea, and the <hi>Ceremonie of Circumcision</hi> was, for many yeeres, continued in the succession of many <hi>Christian Bishops</hi> of
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:13224:76"/>
                     <hi>Ierusalem</hi>; although not Sacramentally, after the profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Iewes, thereby to signifie that <hi>Christ</hi> the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised seed was to come in the flesh,</hi> (which was a <hi>Ceremony Propheticall</hi>) but <hi>Historically,</hi> to shew their descent from the loines of their grand Patriarke <hi>Abraham,</hi> the first fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Circumcision.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So likewise, the Testimonies, which your selues haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged and obiected out of the Fathers, shew, that they did not euermore purge the former <hi>Abuses</hi> of <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,</hi> by <hi>priuation,</hi> in remoouing the things themselues; but sometimes onely by <hi>translation.</hi> As for example<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Councell of <hi>Nice</hi> changed the <hi>Iewish Easter into the Lords day</hi>;<note place="margin">Conc.

                  <p>Lastly, you haue been so frequent, vrgent, and instant in alledging the Testimonies of ancient <hi>Doctors,</hi> for the abolishing of all things which haue beene formerly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused, that a man would thinke you professe your selues to be <hi>children</hi> of those graue <hi>Fathers,</hi> and to yeeld your selues to be gouerned by their prudent directions. But it is well knowne to as many as haue seene the faces of the aforesaid Fathers, either in the generall Histories of the Church, or in their owne bookes, that all of them did both maintaine and practize the vse of <hi>mysticall Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</hi>

Will you therefore admit of their iudgements? why then do you reiect such kind of <hi>Ceremonies</hi>? will you not allow them? why do you then obiect such witnesses, whose vniuersall consent you can so easily contemne? Nay but to refuse (as you often doe) to be tryed by the Testimonies of such <hi>Fathers,</hi> whose patronage in the very same cause you haue so peremptorily challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, must needs bewray in you preuarication, rather than confidence, in this maner of proofe.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, concerning the <hi>Eucharist</hi> likewise, the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thari</hi> would not admit, for the matter, <hi>Bread,</hi> as thinking this Creaturue was from an euill beginning.

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, in Morall causes, (for there may be an <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie</hi> betweene the <hi>Leuiticall pollutions</hi> and <hi>cleansings,</hi> and the <hi>Morall abuses,</hi> and their reformations) a woman that hath committed folly, although she cannot recouer her Virginitie, yet vpon her repentance, she may repaire her honesty: Againe, the person that is as sacrilegious as <hi>Dionysius,</hi> may be restitution and almes, become as truely Gods Almoner, as <hi>Zacheus.</hi> May it bee thus in persons, and cannot the like alteration be had of <hi>Abuses</hi> in actions, which otherwise in themselues are indifferent?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in naturall and artificiall Obiects, both Art and Nature seeme to exclaime against your Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences: For as the Orator speaketh, <hi>Solem è mundo tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lere videtur, qui vsum propter abusum tollit</hi>; He seemes to pull the Sunne out of the firmament, that taketh away the vse of each thing, for the <hi>abuse</hi> thereof.

                  <p>In briefe, to professe to reforme <hi>abuses</hi> onely by vtter <hi>abolishing of the things</hi> abused, is as much as to teach the Chirurgion to professe no cure of mens diseased limmes,

                  <p>We come now to examine your Reason of allowing any of the former <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> although they haue bene <hi>Idolatrously abused.</hi> You alledge that you onely allow them, because they are <hi>profitable</hi> and <hi>necessary.</hi> But what? absolutely necessary? This you cannot affirme, because the primitiue Church (as you well know) of a long time kept not their worship in <hi>Temples,</hi> but <hi>in Cryptis,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in priuate houses and deserts. Nor vsed they <hi>seats</hi> or <hi>Cushions,</hi> for in the time of persecution they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to vse their <hi>Stations,</hi> which sheweth that their common gesture was <hi>standing.</hi> Againe, there was a time, when the <hi>Ministers</hi> were <hi>golden,</hi> and their <hi>Chalices</hi> but <hi>wooden</hi>; and indeed the Church vnder persecution did forbeare to put on any ornaments of <hi>vestures</hi>: and then <hi>Baptisme</hi> was not in <hi>Fonts,</hi> but in <hi>Riuers</hi> and <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines.</hi> Nor were people assembled to the publike Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of God by the sound of <hi>Bels,</hi> but of mens voices. All which accidentall supplies do plainly shew, that the <hi>Profit</hi> of these things, which you your selues thinke worthy to be continued, is of no absolute necessitie.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, you may enquire of the Church of <hi>Geneua,</hi> why she imposeth the <hi>Wafer-cake</hi> to be obserued of her
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:13224:83"/>
Ministers and people, albeit shee is not ignorant, that the <hi>round Wafer</hi> among the Papists had the signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the pence, for which <hi>Christ</hi> was sold by <hi>Iudas</hi>? and became (after their Romish consecration) not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Idolatrous,</hi> but the very <hi>Idol</hi> it selfe?</p>
                  <p>Vpon these Premises, I make bold to argue thus, If your imagined <hi>necessitie,</hi> which is in truth but a <hi>conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie,</hi> be of power to take away the <hi>Idolatrous</hi> pollution of <hi>Temples, Bels, Tables, Chalices,</hi> euen (as it is said) <hi>By the warrant of the word of God,</hi> which requireth <hi>Decency, Order,</hi> and <hi>Edification</hi> in his seruice: then doubtl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And this kind admitteth many Subdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisions: First, than an <hi>Actiue Scandall</hi> is either directly euill, or onely indirectly. The <hi>direct</hi> manner of <hi>scandall</hi> is, when the Act is euill in it selfe. Thus the Act of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids</hi> murther was <hi>scandalous.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. Sam. 12.24</note> And this kind of <hi>scandall</hi> is no way excusable, being euill <hi>ratione obiecti,</hi> which is properly sinne.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Indirect scandall,</hi> is seene in Acts which are in their owne nature good, or at least not euill: but yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause either in respect of time, or place, or of some other Circumstance, the act doth occasionally fall out to be scandalous, as did the <hi>eating of things offered vnto Idols,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. 15.</note> which was therfore forbidden: being a sin either more or lesse, according to the diuerse affections of the Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. For this <hi>indirect scandall</hi> may happen to be after two sorts, sometime without the intention of the <hi>Agent,</hi> who hath no meaning to giue any such offence: of which kind we may reckon the fact of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> when he did so partially apply himselfe vnto the <hi>Iewes,</hi> to the <hi>scandall</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> And this we call the lesse sinne. The other maner of <hi>indirect scandall,</hi> is that which some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times proceedeth from the wicked intent in the <hi>Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizer</hi>; and such was the sinne of many <hi>Heretikes,</hi>

                  <p>A third subdiuision is both in respect of the <hi>cause,</hi> and of the <hi>persons</hi> in cases of indifferencie: For sometime this case is determined by the Church, and sometimes it happeneth not to be publiquely defined. When such a matter is once fully concluded by the Church, whether in part, or in whole, so that it doth not euidently appeare to be against the Word of God, so far forth it greatly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth all such persons to conforme themselues there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, according to the doctrine of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> in a questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Ceremony; If any seeme to be contentious,</hi>

                     <hi>we haue no such custome, nor the Church of God.</hi> For indeed, all men are bound in conscience to preserue aboue all things the regard of the generall peace of Gods Church, before the grieuance of any sort or sect of men. Which the Apostle also doth expresly teach, saying; <hi>Giue offence to no man, neither to the Iew, nor to the Gentle,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Cor. 10.13.</note> 
                     <hi>nor</hi> (which the Apostle addeth in a further speciality) <hi>to the Church of God</hi>: Because such a <hi>Scandall</hi> is so much the more hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous than others, by how much more pernicious a thing it is to the endangering of the health of the whole body, than to <hi>weaken</hi> or lame any one limb or member thereof.</p>

                     <pb n="150" facs="tcp:13224:86"/>But if the case be either not at all, or but onely in part determined by the Church, then is there a charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble consideration to be had of other mens consciences, who are not perswaded of the lawfull vse of indifferent things. Then the generall rule is, that so farre as a man may vse indifferent things (without <hi>offence</hi> of others) he need not to forbeare them. <hi>Eate</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king no question for conscience sake.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.25.</note> Why? Because God hath giuen man a liberty to vse such things, or not to vse them. And the Apostles reason is this, — <hi>For the earth is the Lords.</hi> But in case of offence against others, the Rule is, [<hi>Not to eate</hi>] namely in the behalfe of another mans conscience.</p>
                  <p>This was the cause that the Councell of the Apostles, giuing libertie to vse such meates, as had bene formerly accounted vncleane, did notwithstanding make a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint from eating of <hi>Strangled and Bloud, and things offered vnto Idols</hi>:<note place="margin">Act. 15.</note> lest thereby they might giue offence to the Iewish Proselites newly called to the faith. And for the same cause, the Apostle in great circumspection did circumcise <hi>Timothie,</hi> to auoyde the <hi>Scandall</hi> of the Iewish new Conuerts, and lately called to the faith of Christ: but at another time would not <hi>circumcise Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>

                     <p>If you shall as duely discerne, as I shall truly discouer the manifold crimes, which you seeme to bewray in this one supposition, I suppose that you will be ashamed to haue published such (I shall say no more then I meane to prooue) a false, presumptuous, irreligious, partiall, and pernicious a pretence as this is.</p>
                     <p>First, I haue aduentured to call it <hi>false,</hi> and I thinke vpon good ground, because most of you haue once at your <hi>Ordination</hi> into the Priesthood, and many of you also the second time at your <hi>Institution</hi> into your Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, <hi>subscribed</hi> vnto the lawfulnesse of these <hi>Ceremonies</hi> here in question; which now vpon a pretence of strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of conscience, you do so vrgently and vehemently oppugne. Consider therefore the Case, wherein you now stand, namely (for it is my charge to lay this matter home to your consciences) that you now obiect the <hi>feare of discrediting your Ministry,</hi> (if after the publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of your contrary opinion you should conforme) as the Rule of your consciences, for persisting in Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, although it be to the disturbance of the peace of the Church: And notwithstanding make it no Rule of your conscience, for practize of conformitie and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of the peace of the Church, to <hi>feare the discredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting your Ministery,</hi> by gainsaying your former sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions. Which doth plainly argue the falsenesse of your pretence, as if it were a lesse matter of discredit to contradict the writings of your hands, than the words of your mouthes. But what talke you of <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit</hi>
                        <pb n="161" facs="tcp:13224:91"/>
in such a cause as this, wherein iudicious men must needs account your reformation to be rather a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of a former scandall, than an introduction of a new? Thus much in shewing your pretence to bee false.</p>
                     <p>The same obiection of <hi>discrediting your Ministery,</hi> was likewise called <hi>presumptuous,</hi> because heerby you seeme to arrogate to your selues a prerogatiue proper to the <hi>Apostles</hi>; who, because they were the immediate and infallible organs and instruments of the holy Ghost, and first Embassadours of <hi>Christ,</hi> for the publishing of the Gospel of saluation thorowout the world, might (if peraduenture they had erred in any thing) say of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, as one of them did; <hi>If we be found false witnesses,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.</note> 
                        <hi>then is your faith in vaine</hi>: euen because all the fabricke of the Church of the faithfull is built vpon the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> And accordingly the same <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,</hi> speaking to the same purpose, saith of himselfe, <hi>If I build againe that which I destroyed, I make my selfe a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaricator:</hi> meaning,<note place="margin">Gal. 2.18.</note> that he thereby should ruinate what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer Christian doctrine he had formerly built. But we alas, poore Battes that we are, why should we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume that the <hi>credit</hi> or <hi>discredit</hi> of the Ministery of the Gospel should relie or depend vpon vs? haue wee <hi>seene Christ in the flesh?</hi> or came the <hi>word of the Ministrie</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, that we should assume to your selues the Apostolical pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledges of <hi>not erring</hi> in any thing?

                        <pb n="162" facs="tcp:13224:92"/>And furthermore, why may we not, in the third place, call your former pretence (as we haue done) <hi>irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous?</hi> for you must needs know, that the persisting in an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, for the preseruation of your owne credit, although it be taken at the best, can be no lesse a crime than (which was condemned by the Apostle) The <hi>doing of euill that good may come thereof.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 3.</note> Let vs therefore (I pray you) leaue this Antichristian piece of pollicy to that Church, which in her Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> (as it is to bee seene in the Oration,<note place="margin">Orat. i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, there is as good reason to iudge your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer position <hi>partiall,</hi> because if the <hi>credit</hi> of the Ministry must preuaile in this case, then ought you rather to yeeld vnto Conformitie, for the <hi>credit</hi> of the Church; than, for your owne <hi>credite</hi> sake, to refuse it: seeing that the esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of some few parties, as members, must necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly giue place to the whole body.</p>
                     <p>The last Epithet remaineth, naming your former ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection <hi>Pernitious</hi>; whereunto I thinke my selfe licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by that saying of the Apostle; <hi>Woe is mee, if I preach not the Gospel.</hi> By which words, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in his owne person denounceth a <hi>Woe</hi> vnto euery Minister of the Gospel,<note place="margin">1.

                     </p>
                     <p>But you are readie to regest, that the cause of <hi>silen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing</hi> is not in your selues, but in the Bishops that suspend and depriue you; and therefo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e that they, and not you, become liable to that curse. Know you well what you say; or are you desirous to delude your owne soules? for the case standeth thus: <hi>Titus</hi> the Bishop doth depriue

In this proceeding, the intendment of <hi>Titus</hi> is not abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely to depriue <hi>Titius,</hi> as he is a Minister, but as he was factious, yet so only respectiuely; that <hi>Titius</hi> being depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, he may constitute <hi>Sempronius</hi>: For the charge of a Bishop is not determinate, to appoint this Minister; but indefinite, to ordaine a Minister: so that the course of Gods Plough is still preserued and continued. But as for <hi>Titius,</hi> who will rather be silenced then conforme, it is euident, that the cause of his silencing being his owne refractarinesse, which is onely personal and proper to himselfe, and yet hath no facultie in himselfe to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point or admit of a Successor: why therefore may not he be said to haue as properly caused the suspe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sion from his Ministrie, as the Steward in the Gospel, by his iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice did cause the losse of his office, or <hi>Agar, Sarahs</hi> made, may be saide by her contempt and contumely, to haue put her selfe out of seruice. It is onely the Iustice of the cause that maketh a Martyr: and doubles (which is a matter, that I earnestly desire you to consider) the censure of the Apostles <hi>Woe</hi> being so dreadfull: I ought not to esteeme any thing a iust cause, why I should wilfully incurre the censure of <hi>Silencing</hi> my selfe from preaching, for the which I ought not as willingly to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture my life.</p>

                  <p>In your Obiections you shewed that your care is to
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:13224:96"/>
auoyde the <hi>offence</hi> of persons of your owne disposition, whom you call your <hi>Brethren</hi>; and yet do you neglect the obseruance that you owe vnto the Church. Can there be a plainer note of a distorted affection in any man, than to ward a blow, for the defence of a <hi>Brother</hi>; not caring, or regarding, that the same stroake must needs light vpon the head of his owne <hi>Mother?</hi> I shall desire you that wee may pleade this point according to the strict Law of good conscience; for so the inquitie of your practise will more plainely appeare.</p>
                  <p>Thus then. If my <hi>Brother</hi> be vniustly offended, his <hi>Scandall,</hi> in respect of me, is onely <hi>Passiue,</hi> that is, taken and not giuen: so that the whole fault of <hi>Scandall,</hi> in this case, is to be imputed vnto the sinister apprehension of my <hi>Brother.</hi> But if my <hi>Mother</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> be offended by me, in that wherein I owe obedience vnto her, the <hi>Scandall</hi> on my part is fully <hi>Actiue,</hi> and the whole fault is in my selfe; because heereby I, as much as lyeth in me, do hinder her fruitfulnesse and happie successe, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting and breeding many children vnto God. But you will say, that where some few priuate persons are like to be offended, there the Church ought, in consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting of her <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> to haue respect of those few; albeit the same <hi>Orders</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> which are in their owne nature indifferent, should bee generally affected and desired of the most part. You are herein not a little deceiued, as may be obserued in the Councell of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> which imposed vpon the Gentiles an <hi>Absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence from eating of meates,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>from strangled, and bloud:</hi> To the end that they might auoide the <hi>Scandall</hi> of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter number of Iewish Proselytes, who were like to be <hi>offended</hi> at their <hi>eating</hi> of such meates, which had bene formerly forbidden by the expresse commandement of

God: yet the <hi>Apostles</hi> did not in the same Councell la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to preuent the <hi>offence,</hi> which might haue risen from a conceit of some few Gentiles, then Conuerts to the faith; who peraduenture might thinke that Christian libertie (which is a freedome, to eate of any sort of meates) was not a little impeached by that Apostolicall Canon of <hi>Abstinence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is necessarie that a different respect be had betweene those <hi>weake</hi> ones, which are such <hi>before,</hi> and those that are <hi>weake after</hi> the orthodoxe and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full meaning of the Church, wherein we liue, be fully published, and made knowne.

                     <p>The Non-conformists themselues will acknowledge, that our question, in this dispute, is not concerning that <hi>Christian libertie,</hi> which the Apostle mentioneth,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. whereby we are freed from the rigour of the <hi>morall Law,</hi> pronouncing a curse vpon all them that persist not in all the Commandements of God, to do them: nor of the <hi>libertie</hi> from the Iewish bondage of the <hi>Leuiticall Law,</hi> which the Apostles call an <hi>importable Yoake.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Act. 15.</note> But the subiect matter of this our Controuersie is a <hi>libertie</hi> from the necessary obseruation of such things, which are in their owne nature <hi>indifferent,</hi> as is implyed by the Obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor himselfe.</p>
                     <p>This being the state of our Question, our Reader shall need no more, for the resolution thereof, than to know, first what it is not; &amp; secondly what it is, that may be said to depriue a <hi>Christian</hi> of that <hi>libertie,</hi> which <hi>Christ</hi> by his Testament hath bequeathed vnto his Church: both which he may easily learne, by distinguishing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene two kinds of <hi>necessities,</hi> which are incident vnto

                        <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I Paul say, that if you be circumcised, Christ can profit you nothing.</hi> Why? but onely because <hi>Circumcision,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Seale of the Couenant</hi> of the Morall Law, doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act of euery one, that holdeth <hi>Circumcision</hi> necessary to saluation, an absolute performance of euery minim and iot of the same Law: therfore it followeth, whosoeuer wil be iustified by the Law, becometh a <hi>Debter to the whole

                     <p>Next concerning Iustification by the Law of the old Testament (whereof <hi>Circumcision</hi> was the <hi>Seale,</hi>) the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle teacheth that the difference of the Old and the New Testament, in respect of Iustification, is as much as betweene <hi>Agar</hi> the seruant,<note place="margin">Gal. 4.</note>

                     <p>To question <hi>How,</hi> in this case, must needs be a note of inexcusable ignorance: for what more impardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ignorance can there be, than not to reade that which our Church hath set downe in capitall letters, wherein she auoucheth her owne integritie, professing to vse but a <hi>few Ceremonies,</hi> and those also without opinion of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity:</hi> and not this onely, but furthermore doth often condemne the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> for infringing of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian liberty,</hi> by her Ceremoniall constitutions, both in respect of the <hi>nature,</hi> and <hi>number</hi> of her <hi>Rites.</hi> First, I say, in regard of their <hi>Nature,</hi> by attributing vnto them such an opinion of <hi>Necessity,</hi> which taketh away all <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differencie,</hi> which is done as well by holding and exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing them as necessarie meanes of attaining vnto eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life; as also by placing in them the chiefest and most essentiall part of Gods worship.</p>

                     <head>Our Answers.</head>
                     <p>This point, concerning the <hi>measure</hi> of that obligation of conscience, in the question of due <hi>obedience,</hi> requireth a more exact and accurate discussion, because this Case is variously disputed off in the Schooles.</p>
                     <p>Some take their measure from the will of the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuer: conceiuing, that the conscience of the <hi>Subiect</hi> is then bound to obedience, whensoeuer the lawfull Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour doth impose any Law, with an intention, that men should make conscience of his command.</p>
                     <p>Some fetch the measure of Obligation from the weight and necessitie of the matter that is imposed; which although sometimes it be light in it selfe, yet by reason of some circumstance may become weightie and necessary enough, to challenge performance.</p>
                     <p>Other-some take their line and measure both from the ponderousnesse of the matter, and also from the will and intention of the Law-giuer and Commander, whensoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he purposeth to prescribe any thing vnder that bond of conscience, which God exacteth, in charging men to obey those that are in authoritie. Which purpose of the Law-giuer some vse to discerne by the tenure of the Law and Statute; if it be deliuered in such termes, which may seeme deepely to charge men to performe their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="192" facs="tcp:13224:107"/>But some collect the same intention of the Law-gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer from the punishment, which by the same Law shall be inflicted vpon persons offending: which if it bee but pecuniarie, and of smaller value, then they iudge mens conscience, in such a case, bound only to the payment of that mulct whensoeuer it is exacted.</p>
                     <p>By this last consideration, you may perceiue that your former obiection from <hi>Bowles,</hi> wanteth a <hi>Byas</hi> to bring it to the marke. For the <hi>Statute</hi> Lawes, which prescribe pecuniarie punishments against <hi>Bowling,</hi> lest it should hinder more warlike exercises, (as shooting) ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointeth <hi>wearing</hi> of <hi>Caps,</hi> for the maintenance of some priuate Trades-men, &amp;c. they, holding the mulct of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to be a compensation for the offences, are satisfied thereby; and do not account these commissions, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions, to be contempts, which can little aduantage you, but doth rather strongly condemne you. For the omissions of a professed <hi>Non-conformist</hi> proceed from an opinion, that he ought to disobey in this case; and therefore is, in the censure of the Church, a professed contemner: vpon whom the Lawes of the land haue therefore imposed not a pecuniarie mulct, but a flat de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priuation of his Benefice, and Ministeriall function. In case that the punishment inioyned be very grieuous: as for example; imprisonment, banishment, losse of office and estate, depriuation, degradation, or such like extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, these are held to be sufficient tokens, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the <hi>Magistrate,</hi> in giuing of his Law, was to exact of his <hi>subiects</hi> obedience, by vertue of that Law of God, and to charge them with dutifull subiection in all lawfull commands.</p>
                     <p>And thus you your selues appeare guiltie of a kind of <hi>Contempt,</hi> not for some few omissions of these <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,</hi>
                        <pb n="193" facs="tcp:13224:107"/>
which are not liable to so great censures, but for your continuall refusall, whereupon no lesse than <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priuation</hi> doth ensue. For although the greatest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt be, <hi>Nolle obedire Superiori</hi>; yet are there other properties of disobedience, which do necessarily inferre an high degree of contempt, as namely, when any see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, by many acts, to expresse in himselfe, and to ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in others a viler estimation, either of the person that doth lawfully command, or of the thing that is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly commanded, than they do deserue: in which case we may reckon any outward Act, whereby it shall be knowne, that the doer must needs either incurre the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure of his Gouernour; or else, so much as in him lyeth, disturbe the peace of the Church.</p>
                     <p>In all this, that hath bene deliuered, I take not vpon me to speake so definitiuely, as to preiudice the iudgement of Others, but to shew what seemeth vnto me most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable: much lesse, to confute the opinion of them, that thinke, that the transgression of some penall Statutes of lesse moment doth not make the conscience of the Actor guilty of sinne; but that (if it be without <hi>Scandall,</hi> or <hi>Contempt</hi>) it may haue compensation, by the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which shalbe imposed.</p>
                     <p>Which doctrine, the Romish Schoole it selfe will acknowledge, first in Lawes, which are <hi>purè poenales,</hi> whereof the <hi>Iesuit Vasquez</hi> confesseth: <hi>That they, by the tenure of writing, neither forbid, nor command</hi>;<note place="margin">Vasquez Ies.

                     <p>All which notwithstanding, there is no place of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge or defence, for your manner of opposition, seeing that the intention of the Law-maker, in ordaining of <hi>our Ceremonies,</hi> proceeded from the zeale of Conformitie; the punishment imposed is, in the end, <hi>depriuation,</hi> or <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gradation</hi>; and your owne guilt, by your continuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusall, can be, in the eyes of the Gouernours, no better than <hi>contempt.</hi> Which most of your selues might more easily discerne, if you would but acknowledge (which the pens, and tongues of all men do confesse) that there is the same obligation of conscience, by the Law of God, concerning your obedience to the lawfull orders of the Church, established by the King &amp; whole Estate; as there can be of your owne <hi>wiues, children,</hi> or <hi>seruants</hi> vnto your selues.

Surely we must say, that then shall it not be lawfull for the Church to appoint any thing without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse warrant from Scripture; and so shall we condemne all Churches [Impiae audaciae] of wicked sawcinesse: for all Churches vse, in the celebration of the Lords Supper, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue time, and place, and gesture of body; or else denie that Christ hath freed vs from the abuse of his good Creatures.</hi>

                     <head>Our Answer.</head>
                     <p>In this Obiection, we find three Assertions; 1. that <hi>the Surplice was inuented by Antichrist:</hi> 2. that <hi>Pope Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen did appropriate it vnto Gods seruice: and</hi> 3. that (by consequence from them both) the <hi>Surplice</hi> can haue no lawfull vse.</p>
                     <p>To the first we answer, that the <hi>Surplice</hi> was in old and gray-headed vse long before the Romane <hi>Antichrist</hi> was borne: for the <hi>Inuentor,</hi> whosoeuer he was, could not be yonger than <hi>Pope Stephen,</hi> who (as you said) was the <hi>first Appropriator</hi> thereof. But he liued <hi>Anno</hi> 256. when-as <hi>The Antichrist</hi> did not put out so much as either of his <hi>hornes,</hi> for the space of more than 400. yeeres after. You may therefore lawfully subscribe to your owne wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,<note place="margin">P. Martyr. Epist. p. 1087.</note> who saith that <hi>The diuersities of apparrell were not first inuented by the Pope.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, concerning the <hi>Appropriation</hi> of the <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice</hi> by <hi>Pope Stephen,</hi> vnto Ecclesiasticall vse; it is well knowne, that this <hi>Stephen</hi> was no <hi>Antichristian Pope,</hi> but
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:13224:117"/>
(as <hi>Platina,</hi> whom you alledge, writeth) <hi>a godly Bishop,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Platina in vita Steph.</note> 
                        <hi>who, by his life and doctrine, conuerted many Gentiles to the faith of Christ, and sealed the same faith with his owne bloud, by holy Martyrdome, being beheaded vnder the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour Decian.</hi> So that the Act of this <hi>Pope</hi> must rather fortifie our cause, for as much as this <hi>Stephen</hi> was a true follower of the <hi>Proto-martyr Stephen</hi>; and the Religion which he professed, was almost as different, from the now Romish Superstition, as those times of <hi>Pope Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi> were distant from these daies, wherein now <hi>Pope Paul</hi> the fift possesseth the Papall seate.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, concerning your Consequence, suppose you (if you please) that some bad and <hi>Antichristian Pope</hi> had bene the first <hi>Inuentor</hi> of this <hi>Ceremonie</hi>; yet is your consequence but lame.

                     <head>Our Answer.</head>
                     <p>We haue already discouered your great <hi>Abuse</hi> of Logicke, in this Consequence; whereby,<note place="margin">See aboue part. 1. ch. 4.</note> from the <hi>Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> of things, you inferre the necessarie extirpation of the things themselues. For the present, we are onely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell this your particular exception against the <hi>Surplice.</hi> To this purpose, we must first enquire, wherein you will haue the pretended <hi>Abuse</hi> to consist. Surely, this cannot be imputed to the <hi>matter</hi> of the <hi>Surplice,</hi> for that is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall; nor to the <hi>fashion,</hi> for that is onely artificiall; nor to the <hi>colour,</hi> for that is meerely accidentall. We must therefore seek out the pretended <hi>Popish abuse</hi> in the <hi>Surplice,</hi> as it is <hi>Ceremoniall.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the Ceremoniall obseruation of the <hi>Surplice,</hi> by the Romish Church, we can conceiue but two points, that may be considerable: the first is their <hi>Dedication</hi> of it; the second is the opinion that they conceiue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. The consideration of the Romish practise is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Dedication</hi> of the <hi>Surplice</hi> vnto an Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous seruice. This cannot be a sufficient cause of an vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter abolishing of all the vse thereof:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 8.</note> for the Apostle tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, concerning the <hi>Idolothyta,</hi> that is, <hi>meates sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced vnto Idols,</hi> (which notwithstanding he commendeth to the vse of Christians) that they are so to be vsed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing first <hi>sanctified by their prayers and thankesgiuing,</hi> albeit they were indiuidually the same things, that had bene Idolatrously polluted.</p>
                     <p>It will not auaile you to reply; that this alteration and change of <hi>Idolatrous meates</hi> was for a Ciuill, and not for any Religious vse: Because the Apostle,<note place="margin">
                           <p>1. Cor. 8.4. Beza.</p>
                           <p>See aboue part. 1. chap. 6. sect. 14.</p>
                        </note> in the same place, saying, <hi>Idolum nihil est, An Idoll is nothing in the world,</hi> signifyeth (as <hi>M. Beza</hi> hath well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented) that <hi>The Idoll had no power, or vertue either to
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:13224:119"/>
pollute or sanctifie that which was offered vnto it.</hi> How then can that, being but a [<hi>nihil</hi>] haue force to pollute the religious vse thereof? Which were to make <hi>some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi> of <hi>nothing.</hi> But if we shall admit of your owne assertion, to thinke that the same things, which haue bene <hi>Idolatrously abused,</hi> may not afterwards be applyed vnto any religious purpose: yet what can this inferre against the <hi>Surplices,</hi> now worne in our Church, which are not indiuidually, or numerally the same, that haue bene <hi>Dedicated</hi> to Romish worship?</p>
                     <p>The next point remaineth, concerning the opinion and intention of the Papists, in the vse of their <hi>Surplices,</hi> wherein onely consisteth the formall cause of <hi>Abuse</hi>; which if it may be found in the vse of our <hi>Surplices,</hi> then must we necessarily confesse our <hi>Surplices</hi> to be as truly the same, in their superstitious abuse; as, in respect of matter and substance, we are sure they cannot be iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the same.</p>
                     <p>The conceit and opinion, that Papists haue in this <hi>Ceremonie,</hi> is to iudge it partly <hi>significatiue,</hi> as a signe of a morall dutie; partly <hi>operatiue,</hi> as hauing in it an efficacie of holinesse to defend vs from temptations; or else to hallow certain other things, as hath bene shewne. If you meane to impugne the <hi>Significatiue</hi> propertie, then we say that the Papists opinion is herein iustifia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as we haue already proued, not onely in our gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall confutation of your iudgement in that behalfe;<note place="margin">See aboue part. 1. ch. 3. &amp;c.</note> but in our particular Answer, concerning the <hi>Surplice,</hi> euen by the Testimonies of your owne Witnesses. But if you condemne the opinion of <hi>operatiue</hi> power in the <hi>Surplice,</hi> then our Answer is, that our <hi>Surplices</hi> are not <hi>Popish,</hi> seeing that we ascribe no such efficacie vnto them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="217" facs="tcp:13224:119"/>To conclude therefore, for as much as the <hi>opinion</hi> and intent of the worshippers, is the onely character and forme, to discerne and distinguish a religious worship, from that which is superstitious; the doctrine of our Church, concerning all such <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> being so syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, and iustifiable, and the <hi>opinion</hi> of the Church of Rome in consecrating of her Rites so idolatrous: it must needs be an iniurie, and indeed an impiety, to call their <hi>Popish,</hi> and our <hi>English Surplices,</hi> so precisely the same.</p>
                     <p>We appeale againe vnto <hi>M.

                  <div type="answer">
                     <head>Our Answer.</head>
                     <p>Although the word <hi>Dedication</hi> might be drawne by the generality of the signification to an other sence than the Church did intend, because of the doubtfull ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity which is in it: yet you ought to consider, that some mens Wits are giuen to iudge of words by the sound, and not by the sence. But if you will be in the number of those cleane creatures, which do diuide the hoofe, and chew the cud, you will easily distinguish, and discerne, that there is a two-fold (we speake onely of the Humane) <hi>Dedication</hi>; one <hi>Declaratiua,</hi> which is by way of <hi>Protestation</hi>; the other <hi>Consecratiua,</hi> by <hi>Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This distinction may be inlightned by example. If a man, who is piously deuoted, doth build an Oratory or Chappell for Gods worship, which he doth sequester by Vow and Promise, from the common vse, and lastly as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signeth it vnto the seruice of God; this is called a <hi>Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> by <hi>Protestation.</hi> Afterwards, for a more solemne appropriation thereof to the worship of God, the Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall <hi>Consecration</hi> is required, to the end that, by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and other religious Rites, that place may be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:13224:128"/>
                        <hi>Dedicated</hi> to the same seruice; this is <hi>Dedication</hi> by <hi>Consecration.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And how much more may this distinction take place in the case now in question? For, by the formall words of the institution of <hi>Christ,</hi> the childe is <hi>Dedicated</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, by <hi>Consecration</hi> in <hi>Baptisme,</hi> which is a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Grace; but the <hi>Dedication,</hi> which is signified by the <hi>Signe of the Crosse,</hi> is not by any proper <hi>Consecration</hi> vnto God, or <hi>Token</hi> of grace receiued from God, by such a Signe made: but onely of a declaratiue <hi>Token</hi> of duety, which afterwards the person baptized ought to performe, concerning his constant and visible professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Christian faith. The summe of all is, that the difference betweene the <hi>Dedication</hi> by Baptisme, and by this <hi>Signe,</hi> is no lesse than a Sacramentall Stipulation with God, and a Morall representation and protestation vnto man.</p>

And how doth this differ (I pray you) from your censure of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> noting them to haue as much <hi>abused the Signe of the Crosse; as the ranckest Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, Sauing that they did not bestow diuine worship on it?</hi> Howsoeuer the matter go, we must iudge the <hi>Fathers,</hi> by your Censure, to haue bene <hi>superstitious.</hi> But it would haue became the children of those ancient Fathers to haue acknowledged that Orthodoxe sence in their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings which Protestant Diuines, of principall note, and your owne Witnesses haue obserued.</p>
                     <p>There was indeed often mention made among the ancient Fathers of the <hi>Signe of the Crosse,</hi> but <hi>Chemnitius</hi> willeth you to marke <hi>what kind of Signe it was.</hi>

                        <hi>In the Primitiue times</hi> (saith he) <hi>there was not any Image or fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurature of the face of man, hauing his armes spred out, and nayled to the Crosse, but in the dayes of Tertullian, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Christians did fashion a Transuerse figure, as it were a Crosse, and did Signe themselues: but this was not a signe for worship or Adoration, [non enim tunc aliquid subsistens erat] for there was not any thing really subsis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:13224:132"/>
in that signe, but it was onely [professio &amp; commone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factio,] a profession and remembrance that they should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in Christ Crucified, and put all their hope and confidence in him</hi>; Thus farre <hi>Chemnitius,</hi> to let vs vnderstand the integritie of Antiquitie, in this point, because there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the like superstition in the <hi>Crosse,</hi> as it is <hi>a signe Transient,</hi> which there may be in it, as it is <hi>permanent.</hi>

                        <hi>M.

God be thanked, that they, whom M.</hi> Harding <hi>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demneth, haue bene able not only to abide the signe, but also to take vp their crosse, and to follow Christ, and to reioyce and triumph in the same.</hi> Do you not now perceiue what a large &amp; sound lecture
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:13224:134"/>
this admirable Doctor in Gods Church hath read vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, and in how many points your gainsaying of the vse of this <hi>signe</hi> is confuted?</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>Bishop Iewell</hi> approueth of the <hi>signe of the Crosse,</hi> as it is made <hi>a significant Token</hi> of Christian Constancie in <hi>Banners</hi>; which you will not abide to haue place in the Appendice vnto the ministration of Baptisme.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he alloweth the ancient vse of the same <hi>signe</hi> at the time of Celebration of <hi>Baptisme,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the execrable <hi>abuse</hi> thereof in the <hi>Romish</hi> Church; which you vrge as a necessarie Cause, to haue it vtterly abolished.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, you commonly alledge, and that not without some ostentation, a multitude of Diuines, as (albeit in Titles, rather then in truth) Aduersaries to these and all such kind of <hi>Ceremonies</hi>: Notwithstanding he bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the Consent of holy men and Martyrs (that is, Witnesses of the faith of Christ,) who vndergoing the <hi>morall Crosse</hi> (which is persecution, euen vnto Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome it selfe) were also witnesses of the lawfulnesse of this <hi>Ceremoniall signe</hi> of the <hi>Crosse</hi>: so that you can haue small Cause to account your suffering for Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting this <hi>Ceremoniall Crosse,</hi> the <hi>morall Crosse</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the same godly Bishop noteth these Martyrs to haue admitted of this <hi>signe of the Crosse</hi> (that I may so say) <hi>iam flagrante delicto:</hi> euen when the <hi>abuse</hi> of Popish superstition and Idolatrie was at the height, and when in detestation thereof, they yeelded vp their dearest liues vnto Christ, which notwithstanding in your Conceits cannot be vsed without <hi>superstition,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen now, when superstition is banished.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore the Argument (wherewith I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this part of Confutation) standeth strongly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:13224:134"/>
you thus. Seeing that the vse of the <hi>Crosse</hi> was (as hath bene confessed by your best witnesses) <hi>void of superstition in purer Antiquitie,</hi> the same (notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the former <hi>abuse</hi> by <hi>Papists</hi>) may be practized in our Orthodoxe Churches with like sincerity. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is euident, because there is the same possibilitie of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of an <hi>abuse</hi> that there is of correcting an error. As therefore our Church hath by the mercie and grace of God, purged her selfe from the erronious opinion of <hi>Poperie,</hi> and now defendeth the Primitiue Catholique truth, concerning the <hi>signe of the Crosse</hi>; so may shee as well be thought to haue abandoned the <hi>superstitious</hi> practise of Poperie, and to haue reduced this <hi>signe</hi> vnto her primitiuely lawfull vse: whereof <hi>M.

                  <head>SECT. VII. Our third grand Confutation of their first Exception, is from the practise of the Non-conformists themselues.</head>
                  <p>It is true; <hi>Christ</hi> did administer this Sacrament in a kind of <hi>Sitting-gesture,</hi> and in the same <hi>Gesture</hi> did the <hi>Apostles</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> receiue it. The maine question is, whether the Church be bound to the strict <hi>imitation</hi> of all such circumstances of the first administration? You challenge a precise obseruation thereof; and we desire you to be satisfied from your owne practise: for <hi>Christ</hi> is found <hi>Sitting</hi> at one Table with his <hi>Disciples,</hi> vnto whom he still <hi>Sitting</hi> distributed the blessed Sacrament, as vnto his Communicants; but you, in the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of this Sacrament, departing from the Table of the Lord, walke from person to person, and deliuer these holy Rites vnto them.</p>
                  <p>Say now (I pray you) is there any iust resemblance betweene <hi>Sitting</hi> and <hi>Walking</hi>; or is not the example of Christ as good a prescription, for <hi>Gesture,</hi> vnto Ministers how to distribute the Eucharist, as the example of the Apostles can be vnto Laicks, how to receiue it?

doubt, consider, we pray you, that the Acts of <hi>Christ,</hi> concerning the institution of this Sacrament, were of two different sorts; some were onely occasionall, and accidentall; and some were truely Sacramentall and Essentiall. I call them Occasionall, which accidentally fell out, by occasion of <hi>Christ</hi> his celebration of the <hi>Passeouer</hi>; which, being the Sacrament of the Iewes, was at the same time to expire and die; at what time the Eucharist, the Sacrament of the new Testament, was to take life and breath. Now then, the circumstances of the Passeouer occasioned Christ to institute this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords Supper, onely with his owne family; onely with men; onely in a priuate house; onely in the night; as hath bene said: Whereunto some do referre also the circumstances of the bread, that it was <hi>Azyme</hi> and <hi>vnleauened,</hi> as then, necessarily required in the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of the <hi>Passeouer</hi>; and of the <hi>Cup,</hi> that it had a mixture of water in it, to allay the spirit of the wine; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ordinarie custome of that Country.</p>
                  <p>But the Acts, that were essentiall, and necessarily to be performed, in this Sacrament, are all vnder that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse commandement of Christ, saying,<note place="margin">Math. 26.</note> [<hi>Do this &amp;c.</hi>] beginning first at these words, <hi>Christ tooke bread, and when he had blessed it, he brake &amp;c.</hi> All which circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, deliuered by <hi>Precept,</hi> the Church is tyed to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue.</p>
                  <p>Vpon this occasion, it were no great difficulty, to shew how the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> at this day, hath dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated from <hi>ancient Rome,</hi> by transgressing the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of <hi>Christ,</hi> who said, <hi>Do this &amp;c.</hi> and by doing contrarily, in diuers weighty &amp; obseruable points, and circumstances, there commanded by Christ: as namely, first, <hi>Christ tooke bread, gaue thankes, and blessed
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:13224:138"/>
it; Ergo,</hi> the consecration that <hi>Christ</hi> vsed was in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and not in these foure words, <hi>This is my body.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Christ taking bread, brake it,</hi> and (as is confessed) took diuerse parts out of one loafe; and set not before them (as it were so many <hi>breads</hi>) diuers wafers. Thirdly, <hi>Christ gaue it</hi> vnto them, <hi>saying, &amp;c. Ergo,</hi> they heard what he <hi>said</hi>; and his words were not vttered, or rather mutte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in an vnaudible voice. Fourthly, <hi>Christ</hi> commanded them, saying, [<hi>Take] Ergo,</hi> he spake vnto them in a knowne tongue, and not in a language they could not vnderstand. Fiftly, <hi>Christ gaue, saying, Take: Ergo,</hi> doubtlesse (for the point is confessed from the light of Antiquity) so they <hi>tooke</hi> it, as <hi>he gaue</hi> it, namely, with their hands, and had it not put into their <hi>mouthes.</hi> Sixt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Christ,</hi> that said to them all present [<hi>Take</hi>] said also [<hi>Eate] Ergo,</hi> the vse of the Sacrament, was propounded to be <hi>eaten,</hi> and not to be onely gazed vpon; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons present were Actors, and not Spectators onely. Seuenthly, <hi>Christ</hi> likewise <hi>tooke the Cup, giuing</hi> it vnto them <hi>saying, Drinke you all of this: Ergo,</hi> the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants did equally participate of both the Elements, as being the pledges of both the <hi>Body and bloud of Christ</hi>; not dismembring the Seale of the Couenant, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauding the faithfull of their complementall right. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Christ</hi> expressed the speciall end of the Eucharist, <hi>Do it in remembrance of me</hi>; which is, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprete it, <hi>Shewing the Lords death: Ergo,</hi> it is vnproper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called a <hi>Sacrifice Propitiatory,</hi>

                  <p>Thus we finde, that how many actions haue bene mentioned, concerning the Institution of <hi>Christ,</hi> so many preuarications and transgressions haue bene com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted

                     <p>For the immediate mysticall obiect of this Supper, is the <hi>body and blood of Christ</hi>; the words of <hi>Christ</hi> pointing it out, <hi>This is my body,</hi> and <hi>This is the new Testament in my blood:</hi> But how?

                        <hi>As often as you eate of this bread, and drinke of this Cup, you shew the Lords death till he come.</hi> Which Comment was taken from the Analogie of the Sacrament with the thing signified thereby; for the <hi>bread broken</hi> betoke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth his <hi>bodie Crucified</hi> for vs; the <hi>wine powred out,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembleth his <hi>blood shed,</hi> and separated from his <hi>bodie.</hi> Can you find in all these any one Type of the Celestiall ioy, which is signified else-where, by the promise of <hi>ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and drinking in the Kingdome of heauen</hi>?</p>
                     <p>Neither can it be to any purpose, to say that in giuing vs his <hi>body &amp; blood,</hi> in this Sacrament, we haue bequea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed vnto vs all the benefits of his death, and passion, and Consequently all the ioyes of immortalitie, which may be prefigured by our <hi>eating and drinking</hi> at this <hi>Table</hi>:

                     </p>
                     <p>In the next place, after we haue learned that there was a <hi>gesture</hi> of <hi>Adoration</hi> vsed, we are to enquire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this <hi>gesture</hi> of <hi>Kneeling.</hi> Is not this a <hi>gesture</hi> of <hi>Adoration,</hi> which is often both commended and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in holy Scripture? If then the <hi>Adoration</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> in receiuing of this <hi>gift</hi> be lawfull; Shall the more humble <hi>gesture</hi> make the act of <hi>Adoration</hi> lesse lawfull?</p>
                     <p>The third point remaineth, which is to vnderstand aright, whereunto, or to whom this <hi>Adoration</hi> is to be directed, without danger of <hi>Idolatry.</hi> This is taught vs by our Liturgie; according herein, with the most
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:13224:151"/>
ancient Liturgies of the Primitiue Church: <hi>Sursum corda, Lift vp your hearts,</hi> to wit, vnto the Father of our Lord <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> that gaue his Sonne; and vnto <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe, the Lambe of God, that sitteth vpon the Throne, that gaue himselfe for our redemption, by his body and bloud.</p>
                     <p>Now, to come to the point, and, for the present, to grant that some wicked <hi>Pope</hi> had inuented <hi>Adoration,</hi> by <hi>Kneeling</hi>; yet are wee notwithstanding discreetly to distinguish of colours, lest that, for want of due cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspection, we call <hi>Blacke white, and white blacke.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this purpose, I shall expedite this doubt, by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine demands. I aske then, first, whether euery <hi>Inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Secondly, I aske, shall we condemne the <hi>gesture</hi> it selfe, because it is <hi>Kneeling?</hi> To affirme this, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently to condemne, not so much the <hi>Inuention</hi> of man, as the Ordinance of God; who often requireth in his worship the act of <hi>Kneeling.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, I aske, must we therefore refuse this <hi>gesture</hi> because it is for <hi>Adoration?</hi> To affirme this, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently to disallow the ancient custome of <hi>bowing</hi> the body, for that was a <hi>gesture</hi> of <hi>Adoration.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, I aske, ought we to abhorre this <hi>gesture</hi> of <hi>Kneeling,</hi> onely as it was applyed by the <hi>Pope,</hi> for a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine <hi>Adoration</hi> of the Hoast it selfe? This we confesse to be indeed, a <hi>Popish Inuention,</hi> and as execrable an <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> as Christendome hath euer seene; and to condemne this onely, is fully to iustifie our Church, which doth as

Cannot this sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie you, but you will stil exclaime and say, Why is this reuerence done at the receiuing of the <hi>Eucharist, except it be with the Idolatrous Papists</hi>? I tell you, this is done, not to consent with the <hi>Idolatrous Papists,</hi> but absolutely to confute them, who cannot but acknowledge, that our <hi>Sacrament</hi> of <hi>Baptisme</hi> is a very perfect <hi>Baptisme,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding both to the essentiall matter, and manner, which <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe ordained.

                        <hi>Adoration</hi> (saith he) <hi>consisteth in Inuocation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, and giuing of thankes, all which are due vnto God, and vnto Christ, wheresoeuer they do manifest themselues vnto vs; which is done three manner of wayes; First, by the inward thought of the heart moued by the Spirit of God, in our earnest apprehension of God, and of Christ: then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth our Adoration of them, by inuocating, Confession, and giuing of thankes. Secondly, they declare themselues some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by externall words, as by holy Scriptures, &amp; godly Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. And thirdly, by outward signes, as in the Arke of the Couenant, and in our Sacraments; yet so, that Adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be not fixed vpon the symbols, or signes, but, in Spirit and in Truth, vpon Christ sitting on the right hand of God in Heauen. Notwithstanding, because the simple people, by reason of the errour of Transubstantiation, rooted in them, cannot so easily vnderstand this, I should thinke, that men should abstaine from outward prostrating themselues in kneeling, vntill they bee better instructed. I confesse that many do godlily kneele, and Adore at the hearing of these words, [Et verbum caro factum est,] where notwithstanding not the words, but the things are adored: euen so the signes
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:13224:156"/>
in the Sacrament are not adored.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Wherein <hi>P. Martyr</hi> could haue no other meaning, than, by a <hi>significatiue relation,</hi> from the <hi>signe,</hi> to the thing <hi>signified.</hi> For a man, in <hi>Kneeling</hi> at the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> should vpon the sight thereof abstract his thoughts from the sensible obiect, and lifting vp both his eyes and his heart vnto heauen, should <hi>Adore,</hi> that is (as he saith) <hi>inuocate, confesse, and giue thankes vnto God, and vnto Christ.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But how shall this Answer iustifie the <hi>Popish</hi> manner of worship; <hi>Kneeling before,</hi> and <hi>to</hi> an <hi>Image</hi>; sometimes inuocating the <hi>Image</hi> it selfe, and fixing their thoughts vpon it; or at least vsing to <hi>Adore Christ,</hi> with it? as we shall proue. Whereas, contrariwise, this our <hi>Adoration</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> arising from the sight of the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> is no more, in the iudgement of <hi>P. Martyr,</hi> than when at the hearing of the sensible words of the Scripture, or of a godly Sermon, our thoughts are not fixed vpon the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements of words and syllables, but by them are eleua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and drawne vnto <hi>Inuocation, and thanksgiuing vnto God.</hi> According to this meaning, <hi>P. Martyr</hi> (you see) alloweth <hi>Kneeling,</hi> at the receiuing of the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> to a peple <hi>instructed.</hi> Now if, after three-score yeeres prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, our people haue not bene sufficiently <hi>instructed,</hi> the cause must be imputed either to the ignorance, or negligence of their Teachers; except you will haue vs thinke, that they are past instruction.

                  <head>SECT. XXXIIII. The second absolute, and direct Romish worship of the Sacrament, Idolatrously.</head>
                  <p>It is the <hi>Romish</hi> profession, to <hi>adore</hi> the <hi>Sacrament</hi> (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the corporall substance contained therein) as the very person of the Son of <hi>God,</hi> in the proper substance of his bodily presence; which we iudge <hi>Idolatrous,</hi> not onely by an <hi>Accidentall</hi> possibility, but by an <hi>absolute</hi> infallibility.</p>
                  <p>For first, that the worshippers do <hi>adore</hi> the <hi>bread</hi> with diuine honour, in stead of <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe (which possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility the Doctors of the <hi>Romish</hi> Church do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse) may happen to their <hi>Adoration</hi> of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> by reason of many possible accidents: as if he that consecrateth haue not had a true <hi>Ordination</hi>; or,<note place="margin">See the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale lib. 2. c. 2. sect. 23.</note> in consecrating of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,</hi> haue not a right <hi>Intention</hi>; or, in <hi>vttering</hi> the words of <hi>Consecration,</hi> faile in his syllabicall pronuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; or, if the formes of the <hi>Sacraments</hi> themselues, by vnfit admixtion, or putrifaction, lose their perfection. In all these (for euerie one of them is possible) possibilities it may fall out that the <hi>Romish</hi> worshippers do <hi>adore</hi> with Diuine honour the element of <hi>bread,</hi> in stead of the Son of <hi>God:</hi> which what is it but, at least, an <hi>Accidentall Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry</hi>; but yet true <hi>Idolatry?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They haue, in this case, no other colour of euasion, than to tell vs, that when they kneele downe to <hi>adore</hi> this <hi>Sacrament,</hi> they do it with an implicite and inward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of the minde, saying; <hi>If Christ be present, then I adore thee &amp;c.</hi> But this is a most miserable shift, to make <hi>Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> (which is the highest honour, &amp; homage, which man oweth properly to God) vnto an Hypothetical beleefe [<hi>if Christ be there.</hi>] The truth of God telleth vs, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to God, <hi>He must beleeue that God is,</hi> that is,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:13224:160"/>
honour him with a Diuine faith, that he is wheresoeuer he is <hi>adored</hi>: But in <hi>Ifs</hi> and <hi>Ands,</hi> that is, in fallibilities, there can be no Diuine faith. <hi>Ergo,</hi> this <hi>Suppositiue</hi> faith is meerely supposititious; because it is impossible, that the Ielousie of <hi>God</hi> should admit of a doctrine, or Religion, whereby it must necessarily happen sometime, that the creature should be worshipped with honour, properly due vnto the Creator himselfe. This be spoken of the possibility.</p>
                  <p>How much more <hi>Idolatrous</hi> must they appeare to be, when as, by necessary consequences from <hi>Scripture,</hi> iudgement of ancient <hi>Fathers,</hi> and the aduocation of the perfectest <hi>Senses</hi> of man, it may be infallibly proued, that that which they <hi>adore,</hi> as <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe, remaineth still <hi>in figure, forme, and substance,</hi> the same <hi>Bread,</hi> that it was before <hi>Consecration?</hi> This inferreth such an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libilitie of their <hi>Idolatry,</hi> that it is impossible, but the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Adoration</hi> of this <hi>Sacrament</hi> must be <hi>Idolatrous.</hi> From which kind of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> whether possible, or infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, you will free vs, before we conclude this cause.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto haue we shewne what kinde of worship, in receiuing the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> ours is not; namely, not <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish</hi>; whether you consider the <hi>Relatiue</hi> kinde of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, by making the <hi>Sacrament</hi> an obiect of <hi>Adoration, In quo,</hi> or <hi>per quod</hi>: or else the absolute manner of <hi>Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> by worshipping the <hi>Sacrament, tanquam obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum, quod adoratur.</hi> We are now to shew, what is the obiect of our <hi>Reuerence,</hi> in receiuing the <hi>Sacrament.</hi>

                     <p>This obiection noteth onely a danger of <hi>Idolatry:</hi> but this is <hi>to feare where no feare is</hi>; for although there be not a <hi>Proportion</hi> of equality, betweene a <hi>Ciuill</hi> and <hi>Religious reuerence</hi>; yet is there a <hi>proportion</hi> of similitude, and the one doth singularly illustrate the other, in this case. For as a <hi>Ciuill gift</hi> ought to be taken with a <hi>Ciuil reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> from the hand of an earthly <hi>Soueraigne</hi>: so must a <hi>Spirituall gift,</hi> and the Instruments thereof, be receiued with a Spirituall and Religious <hi>Reuerence</hi>; as from the Maiestie of <hi>Christ,</hi> who instituted, and ordained it for vs. And as the <hi>Ciuill reuerence,</hi> vsed in receiuing the gift of the <hi>King,</hi> doth not derogate from the dignity of the <hi>King,</hi> but rather establish it; because the whole <hi>reuerence</hi> redoundeth to the <hi>King</hi>: so this our religious receiuing of holy Rytes, doth magnifie the Author, but no way deifie the gift. And doubtlesse, none can be so simple, as seeing any Subiect, reuerently taking any grant, or es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially gift, from the hand of an earthly <hi>King,</hi> by the token of a Ring, or, if you will be a rush; as to imagine that worship to be derogatiue to the Royaltie, or Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty of the King.</p>

                  <p>We are not ignorant, that many <hi>Protestant</hi> Authors are most frequent in condemning the <hi>gesture of Kneeling,</hi> at the receiuing of the holy Communion; but how? as it is vsed <hi>Idolatrously</hi> of <hi>Papists,</hi> in a sacriligious opinion, that the Element of <hi>bread,</hi> which they <hi>adore,</hi> is the very person of <hi>Christ:</hi> but not as it may be vsed religiously, by Orthodoxe and godly professors.

                  <head type="sub">First, by their Intentionall Reuerence.</head>
                  <p>You would account it an extreme iniurie, to be cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured as contemners, or profaners of these holy myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; or not to celebrate and receiue them reuerently, with the truely religious affections of your hearts and mindes: which you professe will be the dutie of euery worthy Communicant, that shall rightly <hi>discerne</hi> in this Sacrament <hi>the Lords body.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.29.</note> This being granted (which without impietie cannot be denyed) it ministreth vnto vs an Argument, whereby you may bee confuted (as I suppose) without all contradiction.</p>
                  <p>Fist, I may reason thus: That manner of Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, which it is lawfull for a Christian to conceiue in his mind, the same is as lawfull for him (the case of Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall excepted) to expresse in his outward gesture of bodie. But it is lawfull for a Christian to conceiue such a <hi>Relatiue Reuerence</hi>; as from the sight of the Sacrament (being <hi>Obiectum àquo)</hi> to raise his thoughts to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of the mysticall and spirituall obiect of faith, signified thereby: and vpon the vnderstanding of the mysticall, euen the body and blood of <hi>Christ</hi> really (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:13224:165"/>
not corporally) exhibited vnto vs in this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to receiue these visible pledges of our redemption, by the death of <hi>Christ,</hi> (as the <hi>Obiectum propter quod</hi>) with all holy and reuerent deuotion of heart and mind. Therefore, it is lawfull to performe a sensible and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily reuerence at our outward receiuing thereof.</p>
                  <p>The infallibilitie of this Consequence ariseth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the difference which is betweene the inward, and outward Reuerence: for the inward reuerence is the formall part and very soule of reuerence, and farre exceedeth the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, which is but onely the materiall. Where therefore the materiall and bodily forme of Reuerence is acoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Idolatrous, there the Intentionall and formall much more; because the worship is in it selfe and Act indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and so may become either religious, or superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, by the vse, or abuse thereof, according to the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and mind of the Agent: euen as we may discerne in this one word, <hi>Aue,</hi> vsed in salutation; for many came to <hi>Christ,</hi> and said <hi>Aue; O haile Master,</hi> and did honour him; the <hi>Iewes</hi> also bowed to him, &amp; said <hi>Aue</hi>; &amp; dishono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him. The difference of these two consisted not in the out ward gesture, which was the same (both sorts Salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters) but from the diuerse Intentions, the one kinde per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming their salutations in ciuilitie, but the other in mockery. Euen so the gesture of <hi>Kneeling</hi> is an act in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different in it selfe, being vsed as wel of Children to their Parents, as of either religious persons to God; or sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious vnto Idols: but the formall distinction of each one proceedeth from the mind and affection of the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; for that, which is in childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pietie, &amp; in subiects loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altie, the same is in the truely religious deuotion, and in the superstitious and sacrilegious Idolatrie.</p>
                  <p>Vpon these Premises wee inferre this conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:13224:165"/>
that if there bee in you an inward, relatiue reuerence of soule, in the receiuing of this blessed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, from a respect had betwixt the <hi>Doner, God,</hi> and this holy Sacrament, being so precious a pledge of our saluation: then can it not be vnlawfull, to giue some expression of this your religious intention, by the same visible reuerence, in one, or other outward gesture of the body; especially being to participate of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the seale of mans redemption, both body and soule. And indeed the bodily parts of man are nothing else but the Organs and Instruments of the affections of his soule. If therefore that godly <hi>Indignation,</hi> which the <hi>Publican</hi> had against his sinnes,<note place="margin">Luk. 18.</note> be shrewing (as it were) his owne heart, commanded his hands to <hi>Knock on his breast:</hi>

God.</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. You see how exactly this your choice and venerable Witnesse hath pleaded for an <hi>externall gesture of reuerence,</hi> by <hi>vncouering the head,</hi> at the receiuing of such holy Rytes; which he maketh to be the same, in the case of worship, with the <hi>bowing of the knee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You will peraduenture reply; if the case standeth so, concerning <hi>vncouering our heads,</hi> why are we then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for irreuerence, and why is <hi>Kneeling</hi> required? Shall I tell you? I can conceiue but three reasons here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: the first is, because diuers of you are thought to be <hi>vncouered,</hi> not with any intention to expresse your <hi>reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> at the receiuing of this <hi>Sacrament,</hi> because you condemne those that performe any <hi>reuerence</hi> by <hi>knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>; therefore yee are vrged to <hi>kneele,</hi> that thereby you may manifest your vnanimity of one iudgement with our Church. Secondly, the order of <hi>kneeling</hi> hauing bene established by the Church, and being (as hath bene proued) a <hi>Ceremony indifferent,</hi> it is lawfully exacted, and ought to be performed by you, for expression of vnifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie. Lastly, because that <hi>women</hi> also (who because of their sex may not be <hi>vncouered</hi>) might shew the deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their soules, by their bodily representation of <hi>knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>; this gesture is required for an vniuersality of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To conclude, be you exhorted but to permit your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall <hi>reuerence,</hi> to become visible, by <hi>bodily gesture</hi>; or suffer your <hi>knees</hi> to be answerable to your <hi>heads,</hi> in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>reuerence:</hi> and then may we all ioyne the hands of true fellowship and <hi>godly vnion,</hi> in the participation of this holy <hi>Communion</hi>; and a more acceptable <hi>Thankes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing</hi> in the <hi>Eucharist</hi> vnto the Trinity, in one indiuisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Vnitie, whereunto be ascribed all glory and prayse for euer. <hi>Amen.</hi>
