            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

LETTER
TO A
Member of the Convocation
OF THE
UNIVERSITY of OXFORD.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOU may remember, I was Elected Fellow of <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity-College</hi>
in <hi>December</hi> laſt, but diſapprov'd of
by the Delegates of Convocation (for ſuch, and not
<hi>Viſitors,</hi> I muſt crave leave to call them) the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
the Vice-Chancellor, Doctors of Divinity, and Proctors;
Whereupon, as the Statute-Book and Regiſter of that College
Directed me, I proceeded to Appeal from that ſevere Sentence
of theirs, to the Judgment of our Supreme and Primary Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
the Convocation: The Appeal I then lodg'd, I now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
to Proſecute; and in order thereto it will not, I think,
be improper, or unneceſſary for me to Premiſe theſe Two
Things;</p>
            <p>1. To make out to you, and, through you, to the Convocation
in general, my Right of Appealing, and the Convocation's of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
and Determining my Appeal:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:51443:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
2. To <hi>Propoſe, and Anſwer thoſe Objections the Maſter
urg'd againſt me, before Mr. Vice-Chancellor, Doctors of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,
and Proctors to prevent their Approbation of me:</hi> That,
to remind them of a Power, their Anceſtors formerly did,
and they ſtill may Exerciſe, and this, to encline them to make
favourable uſe of it to the Redreſs of my Grievances.</p>
            <p>To manage the Firſt of theſe Two particulars aright, will,
I foreſee, require more Law, more knowledge in the College
Regiſter and Statutes than my Misfortunes have yet taught me;
therefore I ſhall leave that part to a Friend, who is able to ſet
off your Title to much better advantage: But to Anſwer to the
Crimes alledg'd againſt me, as it cannot properly be expected
from any other, but immediately from my ſelf, ſo it is a Task
which, notwithſtanding all my Troubles, I hope, I need not be
afraid to undertake; ſince Innocency asks only the ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of Truth, and not much Subtilty, or Law to defend itſelf.</p>
            <p>But before I enter upon what I have already propos'd, give
me leave, I pray, to acquaint you a little with the Uſage
which I have all along met with from the Maſter, eſpecially,
for ſome time before the Election; that in the end you may be
the better able to judge, Whether all that Heat, and Vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency
which Dr. <hi>Charlett</hi> has of late proſecuted me with, did
not ariſe rather from ſomewhat elſe, than any Crimes which
I have been guilty of.</p>
            <p>You muſt know then, I had not liv'd much paſt Two Years
in <hi>Univerſity-College,</hi> till, to my no ſmall trouble and diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement,
the Maſter began to diſcover a particular diſlike of,
and averſion towards me; upon every ſlight occaſion, ſlight
indeed, if I had not given it. He was pleas'd to <hi>Sconce, Croſs,</hi>
or <hi>Impoſe</hi> me (for theſe you know are the ſeveral Puniſhments
we have in Colleges) expreſſing at the ſame time ſuch Anger
and Reſentment, as that it cou'd not be long doubted whether
of the Two he intended more, to Torment the Perſon, or Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
and Correct the Offender. This Mr. <hi>Hudſon</hi> my Tutor ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well knows, who has often expreſs'd both his wonder, and
concern at it; and ſo do all my Contemporaries who have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
pity'd and condol'd my Misfortune: But why, the Maſter
was pleas'd to be thus Severe upon me, more than any other
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51443:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Scholar beſides, neither cou'd they, nor I ever at any time learn.
That I us'd to frequent Prayers and Sacraments, duely-perform
and attend the Exerciſe, and other ordinary Duties of the Houſe,
I hope, I ſhall hereafter ſufficiently prove to you; and he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
thought fit to upbraid me with any particular Miſdemeanour
to my Face, or otherwiſe privately Admoniſh me of any by a
Friend; and if he had known me guilty of any, how little ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he cared for me, he wou'd ſo far, ſure, have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
my amendment, as to have told me of my Faults.
There's one Paſſage, which, becauſe it was the firſt occaſion
the Maſter had to be angry with me, I muſt not omit to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
'Tis a Cuſtom the Scholars obſerve in our Chapel, to
Riſe, out of reſpect, when the Maſter comes in, and to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
ſtanding till the Reader begin; this piece of Ceremony I
always perform'd, as duely and conſtantly, as any of the reſt,
ſaving once, when the Reader happen'd to ſtay a pretty while
after the Maſter, I was ſo negligent as to fit down, whilſt others
were ſo careful as to keep ſtanding; this the Maſter unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
obſerv'd, and ſeverely Reprimanded me for't; and it was
the firſt pretence he had to find fault with me, and the only
time he ever charg'd me with Diſreſpect; but whatever notice
the Maſter might take of this neglect at preſent, it was too
ſmall and trifling for him ſure, to remember long: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
I was often told, and greatly ſuſpected myſelf, that a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
College-ſervant, whom for very ſubſtantial Reaſons I cou'd
never agree with, us'd ever to feed and increaſe with falſe Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
and Miſrepreſentations, the Prejudice the Maſter at firſt
took againſt me; but certainly, the Maſter wou'd not give
more credit to the Report of an infamous College Servant, than
to the Teſtimony of the Fellows; therefore I ask his pardon
if, while I am gueſſing at the hidden cauſe of this ſtrange, and
unaccountable Partiality towards me, I happen to aſſign a
leſs honourable one. Whatever the matter was, as he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun,
ſo he was pleas'd to continue his Severity upon me, till I
came to about Four Years ſtanding, <hi>i. e.</hi> till I took an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to go into <hi>Cumberland,</hi> a conſiderable diſtance from him;
but I had not ſtay'd there much paſt half a Year, till my Tutor
writ to me very kindly to come up in all haſte, and appear a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51443:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Canditate for a Fellowſhip which was at that time Vacant:
I came up accordingly, took my Degree, and ſtood for the
Fellowſhip, but happen'd, if ſome of my beſt Friends have not
ſince Complimented me, to come up at that time a little too
late to ſucceed in my Atempt: However the Gentleman who
now enjoys that Fellowſhip ſo juſtly deſerves it, and is ſo very
well beloved in the Society, that, whatever Troubles my Succeſs
at that time wou'd have prevented, which have ſince fallen
upon me, I cannot be ſo injurious to the College, as to wiſh
my ſelf in his Place.</p>
            <p>But to return: Now that I had had the Hardſhip to be
turn'd by the Fellowſhip (for my Tutor uſed ever to call
their Electing a Stranger before me at that time a Hardſhip up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me) I was in hopes the Maſter wou'd in Compaſſion abate
ſomewhat of his wonted Rigor and Severity towards me, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
me to live more eaſily and quietly under him; nevertheleſs
he began to treat me again at the ſame or worſe rate than
formerly, and, as far as I cou'd gheſs, was reſolved ſo to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue;
for as my Friends, as well Fellows, as others, have
often told me, wherever they happened to mention me to any
advantage (for ſome there ever were who from the beginning
deſigned me better Things than what has befalen me) there
wou'd he be ſure to Expreſs his uneaſineſs, and divert the
Diſcourſe with a Frown. And indeed this particular Averſion
of the Maſter's towards me, which as I cou'd never learn the
cauſe of it, ſo I was never any ways likely to abate, did ſo
far affect and diſcourage me in my Studies, That, tho' I
was ever deſigned for Divinity, and had ſpent ſome Years,
and taken a Degree in order to't, yet, as my Tutor may very
well remember, I adviſed with him about quitting the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity,
tho' I had fewer Friends any where elſe, and did
not well know what other Calling to betake my ſelf to.
My Tutor was very much againſt my leaving the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,
but quickly after was convinc'd of the reaſonableneſs of
my leaving the College; and it was upon this memorable Paſſage
which, becauſe I once thought it had happily ended in the
confuſion of ſome malicious Slanderers, and a perfect under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
for the future betwixt the Maſter and me, it will
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51443:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not be amiſs to relate to you at large; The Maſter was
pleaſed this Year to order me to ſpeak a Speech, a Cuſtom
we Annually obſerve on St. <hi>Simon</hi> and <hi>Jude's</hi> Day, in
Commemoration of our Founders, but happen'd to give but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
a Fortnights warning to make it in: Hence it was that my
Thoughts and Studies being otherwiſe neceſſarily engag'd, I
was not at liberty to fit and prepare my ſelf for the Holy
Sacrament which in the mean time came to be Adminiſtred;
nevertheleſs the Maſter <hi>croſſed my Name,</hi> and appear'd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
offended, I heard, at my miſſing the Sacrament; and
when I waited upon him to remind him of the buſineſs I had
in my Hands, the ſhort warning I had to do it in, and the
neceſſity of finiſhing it by ſuch a time, he diſcharged me in
a great Paſſion from ſpeaking the Speech, and ſent me away
with many bitter Reproaches of Impudence and Confidence;
whereupon my Tutor, who knew how buſie I was all the
Week long, and even Sunday too, in compoſing and writing a
Speech, which was to be repeated <hi>Memoriter</hi> on Wedneſday
following, and therefore the more excuſable for miſſing the
Sacrament, told me there was no living quietly for me in this
College, and adviſed me to reſign my Scholarſhip (for by this
time I had been Elected Scholar of the Houſe) and deſire a
<hi>Deceſſit; And go,</hi> ſays he, <hi>enter your ſelf at</hi> Oriel-College, and
he was pleaſed to add, <hi>where you need not doubt of a Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip;</hi>
I went accordingly, reſign'd my Schollarſhip, but was for
ſome days deny'd my <hi>Deceſſit:</hi> In the mean while came the
day of Solemnity when the Fellows thought fit to wait upon
the Maſter, and deſire that I might have his leave to ſpeak
the Speech: The Maſter return'd, and therein gave the true
reaſon of all his Wrath and Indignation againſt me upon this
occaſion, whatever he was pleaſed to pretend about my miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the Sacrament, That he was informed <hi>I had a deſign to
abuſe him in it,</hi> a Crime as far from my Thoughts as it wou'd
have been impudent and intolerable; whereupon my Speech
was immediately ſent for, read over, and returned back to be
ſpoken without any Corrections: After this, the Maſter was
pleaſed to ſend for me and deliver me my <hi>Deceſſit,</hi> which he
before had deny'd me: But meeting with ſome Friends, who
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51443:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſeem'd ſorry to part with me, and my old Acquaintance being
deſirous of my ſtay, I was at laſt perſwaded to wait again
upon the Maſter, and beg leave to continue in the College;
and here it was that I began to hope that the Maſter would
forget the Prejudice ſome ſecret Whiſperers had hitherto
fomented in him againſt me, and leave me a fair way to
perſue his Favour in for the future; for taking occaſion to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
how ſorry I was that I ſhould have the misfortune to
fall under his particular Diſpleaſure, and promiſing, That, if
he would be pleaſed to diſcover to me what it was in my
Behaviour that ſo offended him, I would with diligence ſeek
to amend: He was then pleaſed to anſwer (for I very well
remember the Expreſſion becauſe it was the only one of its
kind I ever received from him) <hi>Well! well! it is no matter;
mind your buſineſs and I ſhall look forwards and not backwards.</hi>
But for all this, tho' I do not know that he has thought fit
to upbraid me with any Miſdemeanor whatever from this
very time down to this Second Election, <hi>i. e.</hi> for a whole Year
and more laſt paſt (for the Crime he charges me with laſt did
not appear to him, he ſays, till a Week before the Election) you
ſhall hear how kind he has been pleaſed to be to me ſince.</p>
            <p>Tho' I was Senior, and, as you may obſerve, had once already
been turn'd by a Fellowſhip, and a Senior, you know, they are
ſeldom, or never ſo unkind as to diſregard, eſpecially, when
he happens to lie under the diſcouragement of a former Repulſe,
Nevertheleſs, as ſoon as this Fellowſhip, which we now Diſpute
about, ſell Vacant, he was pleas'd to declare in behalf of Mr.
<hi>Deniſon,</hi> my Junior, and begun to talk of appointing an Election
out of hand, to fill up the Vacany: But when he underſtood
that the Fellows diſcover'd more Favour for the Senior than
what he either wiſh'd for, or expected, he then thought fit
to ſuſpend it, till in the mean time he might one way or other,
ingage a Majority of them againſt me; and this he endeavours
no leſs earneſtly by the Intereſt, and Interceſſion of Friends,
than his own Solicitations; inſomuch, that there was ſcarce
a Day paſt, wherein ſome or other did not Speak, or Write
in favour of my Competitor; the Maſter all this time, to facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
his own, and their Endeavours, either quarrelling at, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51443:5"/>
deſpiſing my Scholarſhip, or elſe traducing my Morals, cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
aggravating every the leaſt Fault, which once in Seven
Years time I had happen'd to commit, into a groſs Crime, and
Enormity: Nay, ſo fully was he bent to prevent my Succeſs,
that, when during the time of this Vacancy, he might have
Recommended Mr. <hi>Deniſon,</hi> my Competitor, by the Joint-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
of his own, and that of the Fellows, to have been Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
either at <hi>Oriell,</hi> or <hi>Lincoln</hi> Colleges; yet, contrary to all their
inclinations, he wou'd have him ſtay to oppoſe me; whereas I
on the other ſide, either at that time, or any time elſe, was
capable of appearing but at one other College in the whole
Univerſity beſides our own, nor that indeed with any probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of Succeſs: for the Maſter had ſhew'd too great a diſlike of
me, to leave me any hopes of obtaining his Recommendations;
or if he, and the Fellows had both been ſo kind as to have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
together to ſet me out with a good Character it is not
probable it wou'd have availed me very much, when they
themſelves had thought fit to turn me by a Fellowſhip once, and
were ready to do it again, eſpecially at ſuch a time when it
might have been ſuppos'd, I had a fair Claim to that Vacant
One of our own by the Right and Priviledge of Seniority:
And what's worſe than all this, he was pleas'd to deny me the
common favour of a <hi>Commutation of Terms,</hi> which all the reſt
of the Chancellors's worthy Delegates thought ſit to allow me;
whereby he has not only depriv'd me a preſent of the Benefit
and advantage of my Degree (a thing the Univerſity is with good
reaſon ſo tender in as nothing more) but has ſince found out
Means, I am afraid, to debar me of it for ever.</p>
            <p>When he ſaw that all, which he had hitherto done, was
likely to prove ineffectual, and that after Examinations were
over, every Fellow in the Houſe, except Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> was
pleas'd to Approve of me, he then betakes himſelf to a fooliſh,
ridiculous Story, which <hi>Wanly</hi> the <hi>Servitor,</hi> not without the
advice and contrivance of my Competitor, and his Two intimate
Cronies Mr. <hi>Woods,</hi> and <hi>Pricket</hi> Butler, as I ſhall more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
ſuggeſt to you, by and by, ſome Days before had thought fit to
inform him of; and what this was, you'll beſt underſtand, after
I have told what paſt in the Maſter's Lodgings, when to my
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51443:6"/>
great ſurprize, I was Summon'd thither, before the Maſter,
and Four of the Fellows the Day before the Election (for then,
and not till then, did I hear a Syllable of this Objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
me, tho', it ſeems, it has for ſome conſiderable time been
referv'd for a Pinch.)</p>
            <p>1. Mr. <hi>Woods</hi> [A. B.] came and told them, That about a
Year and a half agon, he heard me frequently for near a Month
together, ſay, <hi>That the Maſter was a Familiar with ſuch a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,</hi>
naming him, <hi>as he was with Mr.</hi> Tanner, and he took
the Word <hi>Familiar,</hi> to be there meant in a <hi>Carnal Senſe,</hi> for the
<hi>Young Gentleman who ſat at the Table with me at the ſame time,
bluſh'd nnd ask'd me, If I was not aſham'd to talk ſo?</hi> With this,
the Maſter turns haſtily about, and asks me in a paſſion, <hi>What
I cou'd ſay to all this?</hi> I told him, <hi>I never thought, or ſaid ſuch
a thing of him, as Mr.</hi> Wood <hi>ſaggeſted, in all my Life.</hi> Again,
he ask'd me, <hi>Whether I ever I hud heard ſuch a Story of him,
or no?</hi> After ſome pauſe, I anſwer'd Yes, <hi>I cou'd not ſay, but
I had once heard ſuch a Story of him</hi> (for Mr. <hi>Woods</hi> had
now renew'd that in my Mind, which probably, I ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have remembered of my ſelf) but what I had heard was a
fooliſh Jeſt, told me near 5, or 6 Years ago, of the Maſter
and <hi>Editors,</hi> and not of Mr. <hi>Tanner,</hi> or any other Perſon in
particular; and upon further Examination, I at length told him
of whom, and in what manner I heard it.</p>
            <p>Next comes in Mr. <hi>Grenwood,</hi> [A. B.] and after him <hi>Wanly</hi>
the <hi>Informer,</hi> each of them in order told their ſeveral Stories,
which, ſince they do not affect me, it's not neceſſary here to
repeat.</p>
            <p>All then, that was Alledg'd againſt me at this time, was,
That I us'd to tell a Young Gentleman, <hi>That the Maſter was
grown as familiar with him, as he was with Mr.</hi> Tanner. But
by next Morning, which was Election-time, Mr. <hi>Woods</hi> had
very much improv'd his Story; it was now no longer the
Maſter was as <hi>familiar with ſuch a Gentleman, as he was with
Mr.</hi> Tanner, That happen'd to be a more ſoft and modeſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of his own, but the Maſter us'd to <hi>Ride ſuch an one, and
make him a ſecond</hi> Tom. Tanner. With this improvement, the
Maſter Read it to the Eellows when they were met together to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51443:6"/>
Elect, who thought it very odd, that the Gentleman ſhou'd va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thus in his Evidence, and ſince he was ſuch a particular
Friend of Mr. <hi>Deniſon's,</hi> did not know, but the whole might
be a Contrivance to promote his Intereſt; which they did the
more juſtly ſuſpect, becauſe it was trump'd up the very Day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Election, was not deliver'd upon Oath, and whether
under his Hand they did not know; for the Maſter, when they
deſir'd to ſee it, refus'd to ſhew it them; and when they wou'd
have Examin'd the Witneſſes in his preſence, he abſented him
ſelf, ſent for them to his Lodgings, and order'd them to give
the Fellows no Information; nay, when Mr. <hi>Greenwood,</hi>
thinking that too great a diſreſpect to be ſhewn to the Fellows,
ventur'd to come and tell them that little which he knew of
the Matter, he forthwith ſent for him, and fell to Threaten
him again at the ſame Rate as he had before done when he
found him backward to come in a Witneſs againſt me, telling
him, <hi>He wou'd pluck the Gown over his Ears, and Expel him
the College:</hi> I ſay, notwithſtanding the Fellows thought, that
they had hereupon good reaſon to give no credit to Mr. <hi>Woods's</hi>
Story, and judg'd themſelves not civilly Treated, yet, becauſe
they wou'd preſerve the Peace of the College, if poſſible, and
pay what Reſpect was due to the Reputation of a Perſon in his
Station, they offer'd the Maſter, <hi>That I ſhou'd ask his Pardon
in what manner he pleas'd, or ſubmit to any Puniſhment he
wou'd inflict for the Crime he ſuppos'd me Guilty of.</hi> After re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
offers of this kind to no purpoſe, they made him this fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Propoſal, <hi>That if he pleas'd, they wou'd agree to the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
off the Election till the Gentleman, to whom Mr.</hi> Wood <hi>ſaid,
the Words were ſpoken to, cou'd be ſent for, and that if he,</hi> who
was equally Reflected upon with the Maſter, and had the moſt
reaſon to remember them, <hi>wou'd confirm Mr.</hi> Wood's <hi>Teſtimony,
that then, not a Man of them wou'd any longer appear for me,
but deliver me up, and leave me to his Mercy.</hi> So different was
the Behaviour of the Fellows from that of the Maſter upon
this Occaſion, tho the Power in that College is equally in their
own Hands, and all Things are to be Determin'd there by a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority.
After ſeveral Adjournments that Day, the Maſter at laſt
ſeem'd very deſirous to have the Election put off for one half
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51443:7"/>
Hour longer; which when the Fellows had agreed to, he ſends
for Mr. <hi>Hinckley,</hi> and tells him, he <hi>had another Witneſs,</hi> Mr.
Deniſon, <hi>and he would Swear to the ſame purpoſe; if he
thought this material, he might Communicate it to the reſt
of the Fellows, if not he ſhou'd keep it ſecret.</hi> Mr. <hi>Hinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>
return'd, and with very good reaſon too, <hi>That he did not
take a Competitor's Evidence to be very material, and for his part
ſhou'd not regard it.</hi> The Fellows therefore, knowing me
clear from all other Exceptions, and laying no ſtreſs upon what
Mr. <hi>Woods</hi> alledg'd without the concurrent Teſtimony of the
Gentleman to whom the Words were ſpoken, at the next
Meeting did me the Honour to Elect me.</p>
            <p>Thus have I given you a brief Account of the Maſter's good
Inclinations towards me, from the time I was Two Years
ſtanding, till the time I was Elected Fellow: Come I to
what I at firſt chiefly intended, namely, <hi>To Propoſe, and
Anſwer thoſe Objections the Maſter urg'd againſt me, before
Mr. Vice Chancellor, Doctors of Divinity, and Proctors to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
their Approbation of me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Election being over, and Mr. Vice-Chancellor, Doctors,
and Proctors being met together the Day following in the
Maſter's Lodgings, in order to approve, or diſapprove the Party
Elected, Dr. <hi>Bouchier,</hi> the Maſter's Advocate, Read a long and
black Indictment againſt me, ſetting me forth, <hi>As a notorious
neglecter of Prayers, a ſcandalous deſpiſer of the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and an infamous Noctivagator; one who was obſtinate and
contumacious in his Temper, deaf to all Advice, and proof againſt
Correction; one who had wilfully and deliberately Perjur'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in the Face of the Univerſity, and laſty, had utter'd ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Words againſt the Maſter, Words too groſs and heinous to be
repeated.</hi> And indeed, if they cou'd but once have made out
what they ſo furiouſly alledg'd, Mr. <hi>Woods</hi> [the Maſter's Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Advocate] might then with great Juſtice have inferr'd,
<hi>That I was neither fit for that Society I was deſign'd for, nor for
any Society at all.</hi> But the Proof, it ſeems, which was brought
to make good all the Hard Names Dr. <hi>Bouchier</hi> was pleas'd to
call me, was ſuch, that I have ſince, to my comfort, heard,
ſeveral of the Reverend Doctors ſhou'd ſay, <hi>They were, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51443:7"/>
very well ſatisfy'd with my Character;</hi> and Mr.
<hi>Smith,</hi> the only Fellow who oppos'd my Election, was ſo
kind as to confeſs to me, that very Morning I took my leave of
him, <hi>That my Friends had bore that Teſtimony of me, in anſwer
to all other Objections, except that one relating to the Maſter, that
he thought I cou'd not juſtly be upbraided with them hereafter:</hi>
But becauſe the Maſter, and his Friends have, notwithſtanding,
ſince been very Cruel in their Miſrepreſentations of me, at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Places, as well as at <hi>Oxon,</hi> threatning, <hi>To make all the
Biſhops in</hi> England <hi>deny me Holy Orders,</hi> I ask you pardon if
I enlarge a little upon ſo juſt and neceſſary a Defence.</p>
            <p>And here, I muſt readily own, and confeſs to you, That in
all theſe Seven Years, I have ſomtimes miſt Prayers, at one
time or other abſented myſelf from Sacraments, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
been abroad after Nine a Clock; but that I have been ſo
far Peccant in any of theſe Inſtances of my Duty, as to come
ſhort of thoſe who ſtand the faireſt in the Maſter's favour, or
to loſe at any time the Character of a Regular Student: This
I hope you will as readily allow me, when I have told you,
that the Reverend Mr. <hi>Naylor,</hi> Mr <hi>Hinckley,</hi> and the Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Mr. <hi>Bertie,</hi> did all Three bear ample Teſtimony before
the Delegates to my Regular Obſervance of theſe ſeveral Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
and, if thoſe Gentlemen had pleas'd, they might have
heard all the reſt of the Fellows to the ſame purpoſe, except
Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> and he, which is Teſtimony ſufficient, can ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to the contrary.</p>
            <p>But I paſs on to the Charge of <hi>Stubbornneſs and Contumacy.</hi>
The Inſtances they bring of this untoward temper of Mind,
are Two.
<list>
                  <item>
                     <hi>The I.</hi> Drawn from the manner of reſigning my Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larſhip.</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>The II.</hi> From my not asking off <hi>Sconces.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>In anſwer to the firſt of theſe, I need only refer you to what
I have already ſet down Pag. 5, 6. where you may obſerve, I
did not in a bravading manner throw up my Scholarſhip,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51443:8"/>
but with the advice of my Tutor reſign it; and that too, upon
a very prudent Conſideration, in hopes, after ſome proof given
there of my Manners and Behaviour, I might ſucceed in a Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip
at <hi>Oriel-College,</hi> ſince, according to the Uſage I met
with from the Maſter, I cou'd not expect one in our own. But
I happen'd to make uſe of a Word in my Reſignation, which I
underſtand ſince, gave ſome offence: It ſeems I call'd my Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larſhip
<hi>Portiuncula exhibitionis,</hi> and the reaſon was, becauſe
that ſame Benefaction us'd to be held formerly entire, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
all to one: But the Fellows upon diſcovery of the Donor's
Will, ſaw reaſon to divide it, and gave one Half, which was
Fifty Shillings a Year to me, and I thought I had hit upon a
very proper Word to expreſs the half of a Scholarſhip, tho' I
am very ſorry to find that the propriety of the Word
ſhou'd be miſconſtru'd reſentment.</p>
            <p>2<hi>dly.</hi> As to the ſecond Inſtance of Stubbornneſs, my not ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
off <hi>Sconces.</hi> For the firſt Two Years, or more, I believe,
I was never <hi>Sconced</hi> at all; and afterwards, as I remember, the
Maſter and Dean us'd always to give them out to the Poor, leſt
they ſhou'd be troubled every time with this and tother Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
asking off his Penny and Two Pence; and ſo ſay all my
Contemporaries; ſome of whom, never ask'd off a <hi>Sconce</hi> in
all their time. Of late, ſince the Maſter has expected it, I have
for the moſt part ventur'd to go and ask them off, tho' I was
ſure, when ever I went, to be very roughly receiv'd. Some
few times indeed, I have forborn to ask them off, chuſing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to loſe my <hi>Sconces,</hi> than to remind him of them, to his,
and my own uneaſineſs.</p>
            <p>Since the Maſter has forgot it, I crave leave to remind him of
another Inſtance beſides of my Stubbornneſs and diſobedience
towards him, which is this: Soon after I had ſucceeded in this
Scholarſhip, which I a little before mention'd, there was another
fell Vacant, better than the former, and the Maſter fore ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that I was likely to be Advanc'd to't, ſends for Mr. <hi>Hinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi>
whom he ſuſpected wuo'd prove my Friend, and tells him;
<hi>There was a Young Gentleman,</hi> naming him, <hi>in the College,
whom he had a great kindneſs for, and ask'd him, What he
thought of Electing him into this Scholarſhip?</hi> My Friend was
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51443:8"/>
pleas'd to make kind mention of me at that time, ſaying, <hi>I
was Senior, and he thought, the Fellows cou'd not well deny me,
if I ſhou'd happen to ſtand ſor't: But,</hi> added he to the Maſter,
<hi>here are ſeveral</hi> North-Country <hi>Fellowſhips in the Houſe, and if
you will pleaſe to be ſo kind as to give him any hopes of obtaining
your Favour, when in time he ſhall become capable of one, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
he will for the preſent be glad to recede, and give place to
whom you think fit.</hi> This he agrees to, and word was brought me,
of the <hi>fair opportunity I had, of engaging the Maſter under promiſe
hereafter to be kind to me.</hi> Which you may he ſure, I was very
glad to embrace, dreaming of nothing, but of the <hi>North-Country</hi>
Fellowſhip the Maſter was to help me to, and little thinking,
he wou'd prove the only means to turn me out of one, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Expel me, into the bargain. But after all this <hi>ſtubborneſs,
and contumacy,</hi> the Maſter was pleas'd to upbraid me with, I
hope, he cannot ſay, but I carried him readily all the Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
he ever thought fit to ſet me, and that too, when others,
who were Impos'd at the ſame time, were never call'd upon
for theirs; and that I waited upon him duely, and ſubmiſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon all occaſions, tho' I have often gon Three or Four
times before he wou'd allow me to ſee him: And Laſtly, I
Appeal to the ſeveral <hi>Officers</hi> of the College (whom I have
had occaſion now and then, to appear before) who are all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to deliver a much different Character of my Temper.</p>
            <p>I proceed to that heavy and black Crime of wilful and
deliberate Perjury, a Crime which they themſelves, to be
ſure, muſt needs diſtruſt the proof of, elſe I do not ſee what
occaſion they had to trouble themſelves any farther. It ſeems
they produce you a Letter from a Country Attorney, who
tells them, That <hi>My Father died in ſuch and ſuch Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and left me an Eſtate of one Hundred and Twenty Pounds
per Annum:</hi> This Eſtate they ſay I <hi>made away with upon
taking my Degree, to avoid the Charges of Compounding,</hi>
and ſo they fetch about the Crime of Perjury. Perhaps word
might be ſent this Attorney, that I was courting a Fortune
inſtead of ſtanding for a Fellowſhip, which made my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-man
give ſuch an Honourable Account of my Eſtate; how
ever a Perſon of Quality, whoſe Honourable Father was
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51443:9"/>
my Guardian, and therefore he may very well be ſuppoſed to
know my Circumſtances ſomewhat better than their Country
Attorney, upon notice given him of this Objection againſt me,
ſent the Fellows a much different and truer account of my
Fortune; ſo that, there remains nothing for me to add more,
but to leave them to anſwer for the uncharitableneſs of their
Cenſure.</p>
            <p>I have gone thus far in the Indictment, and I hope clear'd
myſelf too, as far as I have gone, of the Aſperſions caſt
upon me; and now to give you a ſufficient Teſtimony, once
for all, of my Carriage and Behaviour, in oppoſition to all
other Exceptions, as well as theſe. Be pleaſed to conſider,
that the Fellows were ſo well ſatisfied with it, that not a
Faction, or a Party, but every Fellow in the Houſe, except
Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> declared on my ſide, as well thoſe who were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
as thoſe who were preſent; nay, thoſe very Fellows,
who were otherwiſe willing to oblige the Maſter, could not
by all his Sollicitations be drawn from me, till their laſt Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
was raiſed againſt me, and then only, to ſuſpend
their Votes, not to give them againſt me; and this is more,
I hope you'll pardon the Vanity of the Obſervation where it is
ſo neceſſary, than any Candidate in our Houſe, who was once
ever oppos'd, can boaſt of.</p>
            <p>Come we now to their laſt and greateſt Objection name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>The Words ſaid to be ſpoken againſt the Maſter;</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Maſter did not only prefer theſe Words as an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
againſt my Manners and Behaviour, and thereby got
me tum'd by the Fellowſhip; but, when that was done, for
the very ſame Words commenced his Action againſt me in
the Vice-Chancellor's Court, and procur'd my Expulſion, and
that too, whilſt an Appeal was depending; and ſince the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
given in againſt me before the Reverend the Delegates,
happened to be repeated afterwards in Court, not without
ſome Alterations and Additions, as well as freſh Witneſſes
produc'd, I ſhall for the preſent wave what was Sworn con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corning
this Particular in the Maſter's Lodgings, and haſten to
Examine their Proof, where I find it delivered at large: only
before I go any farther, give me leave to ſay a Word or two to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51443:9"/>
what the Maſter it ſeems was pleaſed to tell the Delegates,
about his denying me my Degree, and his Admoniſhing me one
time about my miſſing the Sacrament;</p>
            <p>1. He was pleaſed to tell the Vice-Chancellor Doctors
and Proctors, that the reaſon why he deny'd me my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
was, becauſe <hi>I went about to get a Letter without firſt
acquainting him with it,</hi> a Reaſon very different from what
he was pleaſed to give me; for not mentioning a Syllable of
my going to get a <hi>Letter</hi> without firſt acquainting him, he
told me, As <hi>I had ſtay'd ſo much longer than I needed to have
done Undergraduate for my own pleaſure, ſo I ſhou'd be forced
to ſtay as long Batchellor for his.</hi> But how I behaved myſelf
upon this occaſion, I ſhall here punctually relate to you. When
I became ſtanding for my Maſter's Degree (which was in <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaelmas
Term</hi> laſt) I waited upon Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> the Senior
Fellow (for the Maſter was at that time abſent) to deſire
leave, that the Terms which I had kept ſupernumerary to my
Batchellor's Degree ſhou'd be transferr'd, and accounted to my
Maſter's (a favour every day asked, and as commonly grant<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed
in the Univerſity) Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> ſeem'd very well ſatiſfy'd but
withall told me, <hi>It wou'd look more reſpectful to wait the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's
return, and take his leave;</hi> accordingly, as ſoon as I
had deſired the Regiſter to draw me up a <hi>Letter,</hi> and lodge
it ready in Mr. <hi>Sherwin,</hi> the <hi>Beadle's</hi> Hand, I ſtay'd and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
the Maſter's return; The Maſter being come, I waited
upon him, deſiring of him the ſame Favour, as I had done of
Mr. <hi>Smith:</hi> He neither granted nor deny'd it me, but took time
to conſider of it; whereupon I went ſtraight to Mr. <hi>Shewin,</hi>
and order'd <hi>Him to have a care not to preſent my Letter to the
Delegates till further notice:</hi> Mr. <hi>Sherwin</hi> accordingly, as he
was going to get other <hi>Letters</hi> Subſcribed ready for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation,
calls to know what he muſt do with mine: I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
to come an Hour after and tell him: Whilſt I went to
learn the Maſter's Reſolution, Mr. <hi>Sherwin,</hi> whether to ſave
labour, or preſuming more upon the Maſter's Favour than I
durſt do, gives my <hi>Letter</hi> amongſt the reſt to be Sign'd, and
when I came to bid him lay it aſide, I found it to my ſurprize
Subſcrib'd by all the other Delegates; however, I did not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:51443:10"/>
to make any Uſe or Advantage of it; and what the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
can quarrel at in all this, I cannot imagin, unleſs it be for
coming officiouſly to ask his Leave to commute my <hi>Terms,</hi>
which no Body, it ſeems, is oblig'd to do; But however
Things have ſince happen'd, I am loath to repent of any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
which I have pay'd him.</p>
            <p>2ly, <hi>He ſays,</hi> He one time ſent for me, and cordilly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed
me about miſſing the Sacrament, and withall, was ſo
kind as to give me Arch-Biſhop <hi>Tillotſon's</hi> Diſcourſe concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
frequent Communion to read over: I returned ſoon after,
delivered back the Book, and told him very pertly I did not like
the Doctrine.</p>
            <p>I very well remember about Six of us (amongſt whom
were the two Evidences, Mr. <hi>Wood,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Deniſon,</hi>) miſt
Sacrament once; the Maſter ſent for us, and ordered us for
our Puniſhment, to Tranſlate the Treatiſe above-mention'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Latin;</hi> in ſome competent time I finiſhed the Tranſlation,
and carry'd it (which by the bye, none but Mr. <hi>Laurence</hi> and
I ever did) but that the Maſter was neither ſo kind, at that
time, as to admoniſh me about miſſing the Sacrament, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
that Book to me, any otherwiſe than the bare or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
me, amongſt the reſt, to Tranſlate it might imply, all
thoſe Six can bear me witneſs; and I ſolemnly declare, That
neither upon that occaſion, or any other, did I offer to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
to the Maſter my like or diſlike of the Doctrine there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd
in any manner whatever, as I remember; and if I had
done it, as the Maſter pretends, I am apt to believe he wou'd
have given me good cauſe not to have forgot it.</p>
            <p>This being ſaid, I paſs on to tell you, That after the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legates
had thought fit to diſannul the Election, I little thought
then of Appealing from their Sentence: I comforted myſelf
in my loſs, as well as I cou'd, with the Zeal and Affection
my Friends had openly ſhewed me upon this occaſion;
and was more ſorry to think I was to live apart from a Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which appeared to love me ſo well, than any thing elſe:
but when I heard the Maſter of Arts, from whoſe Voices I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
relief in Convocation, talk compaſſionately of my Caſe,
and Dr. <hi>Charlett,</hi> not ſatisfy'd with the loſs of my Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:51443:10"/>
began afreſh to threaten me with Expulſion; and when I
ſaw Mr. <hi>Deniſon,</hi> who from a Friend and a Competitor had
turn'd my Accuſer, going to be Elected by the Maſter, and
Four of the Fellows, into that very place he had before Sworn
me out of I was then either encouraged or provoked to Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal:
And indeed I dare almoſt put it upon any one to ſay,
whether in the like caſe he wou'd not have done, as I have;
for, to put the matter as they wou'd have it, Mr. <hi>Deniſon</hi>
heard me now and then make merry with ſome odd Words
at Table, which he interpreted to imply Scandal upon the
Maſter, but it ſeem'd ſo light a thing to him at that time,
that he did not think it worth his time, either to adviſe his
Friend to forbear, or to inform the Maſter of the Abuſe;
about Two Years after I was likely to carry away a Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip
before him, he calls to mind this old Affront paſt
upon the Maſter, and tho' he did not go and inform the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of it, he ſet <hi>Wanly</hi> to do't, and came in himſelf for a
Witneſs; or elſe, I pray, what ſhou'd make <hi>Wanly</hi> ſo buſie with
it juſt at this time above all others, he had heard this Story a
Year and a half ago in a very groſs manner from Mr. <hi>Bruch,</hi>
but nevertheleſs did not think it worth his time to take notice
of it? Or how at laſt cou'd he tell the Maſter that I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in't, ſince he had heard this matter from another, and
never at any time from me? Why now Mr. <hi>Deniſon,</hi> I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
had told him, as he had done Mr. <hi>Greenwood</hi> a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Election, That I <hi>had likewiſe ſaid, that the Maſter
B</hi>—Tom. Tanner, (for ſo it ſeems he made me ſpeak)
<hi>and if the Maſter did but know this of me, I ſhou'd never come
in Fellow.</hi> This made <hi>Wanly</hi> go, about a Month before the
Election, very conſidently to deſire Mr. <hi>Elſtob</hi> to inform the
Society of this Objection againſt me, and this occaſioned that
Wiſe Debate, <hi>Prickett</hi> confeſt in Court, <hi>Wanly</hi> and he held,
whether was the properer Perſon of the two to diſcover this
ridiculous Story to the Maſter; and lattly, this occaſioned
thoſe dark and ſecret Cabals, Mr. <hi>Wood,</hi> Mr. <hi>Deniſon, Wanly,</hi>
and <hi>Prickett</hi> the Buttler uſed to hold frequently before the
Election in the Cellar, and elſewhere, which, the Batchellors
an all tell you, I ever expreſſed my Fears and ſuſpicions of:
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:51443:11"/>
and indeed this Club was reſolved, it ſeems, whatever came
on't to ſecure Mr. <hi>Deniſon</hi> the Fellowſhip; for when Mr.
<hi>Greenwood,</hi> after I had been reprobated, began to talk of
ſtanding for't, <hi>Wanly</hi> told him in a very menacing manner, <hi>He
had not beſt think of any ſuch thing, for they would ſoon rout
him out as they had done the other before him.</hi> It was not
then out of any duty or obligation, that they inform'd of theſe
words of mine (for then they muſt have inform'd of them as
ſoon as they had heard them) nor out of any injury they ſaw
done to the Maſter's Reputation (for what Injury cou'd be
done the Maſter's Reputation by Words, which no body re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
but themſelves?) no, but they wanted a ſufficient
Objection to turn me by the Fellowſhip to make room for
Mr. <hi>Deniſon;</hi> and ſome ſuch Story wou'd they have trumped
upon Mr. <hi>Greenwood,</hi> if he had ſucceeded: Well then might
I Appeal and try, if happily I cou'd regain my Right, which
I had for no other reaſon been bereft of, but becauſe Mr.
<hi>Deniſon</hi> ſhou'd have it.</p>
            <p>The Appeal being lodg'd, and the Maſter not thinking fit to
condeſcend to any Terms of Accommodation, or indeed, give
me any aſſurance of Pardon, not ſo much as privately, and by
a Friend, in caſe I wou'd wave my Appeal and ſubmit (I ſay
aſſurance of pardon in caſe I wou'd have ſubmitted, for hints
and items to ſubmit, I confeſs, I had many, but withall I cou'd
get no private Promiſe, or ſecurity made me of pardon if
I wou'd have ſubmitted) and I on the other ſide being very
loath to forego the advantage of my Appeal, and entirely truſt
to his mercy, who, as he had before reſolutely refus'd all ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of Satisfaction, how great ſoever, when the Story was pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,
and within our own College, much more I thought wou'd
he do ſo, when it was become the publick Talk and News of
the Town, and the Votes of the Heads of Houſes had paſt in
his favour: The Maſter, I ſay, not thinking fit to ſend me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
private aſſurance of pardon, in caſe I wou'd ſubmit, and I
without ſuch aſſurance, juſtly fearing leſt my Submiſſion ſhou'd
be miſconſtru'd a Confeſſion, and ſubject me to ſome further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniency,
Matters were for ſome time at a ſtand, till on the
15th. of <hi>Ian.</hi> 9 8/9 I was Summon'd to Appear in the Vice-Chancellor's
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:51443:11"/>
Court, at the Suit of the Reverend Dr. <hi>Charlett,</hi>
and the Reverend Mr. <hi>Tanner.</hi> And here, in the firſt place, I
have good reaſon to complain, That Dr. <hi>Bouchier,</hi> who Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
me ſo earneſtly before the Delegates, and with all the
Aggravations the Zeal of ſo Learned and Eloquent an Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
cou'd ſuggeſt, ſhou'd, nevertheleſs, ſit as my Judge, and
give Sentence upon a Charge which he himſelf, but ſome Days
before, had manag'd and dreſs'd up againſt me; but with all
due regard to ſo great Character, and without reflection up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Juſtice of his Proceedings, I ſhall fairly State the
Facts which were alledg'd againſt me, and then, according to
a deer bought Diſtinction, return Anſwer to them in a double
reſpect:</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. I ſhall make Anſwer to them, as they are Alledg'd to
ſet forth matter of Scandal and Defamation upon the
Reverend Dr. <hi>Charlett,</hi> and the Reverend Mr. <hi>Tanner;</hi>
and ſo relate my Expulſion:</item>
               <item>II. As they ſet forth an Objection againſt my good Manners
and Behaviour; and ſo relate my Reprobation.</item>
            </list>
            <p>The Depoſitions are as follow.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Mr.</hi> Woods <hi>Swears (to compriſe the ſtrength of his Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in as few Words as I can</hi>) That ſometime after I had
miſs'd a Fellowſhip of <hi>Univerſity</hi>-College, which happen'd on
<hi>Feb.</hi> 23 9 6/7 [<hi>almoſt Two Years agoe</hi>] he heard me at Table in our
College-Hall ſay, That <hi>Arthur</hi> (meaning the Maſter) did <hi>ride
Tom. Tanner</hi> (meaning Mr. <hi>Tanner</hi> Fellow of <hi>All-Souls</hi>-College)
and made Mr. <hi>K.</hi> a ſecond <hi>Tom. Tanner;</hi> theſe Words he heard
me repeat frequently, for near a Month together, inſomuch, that
Mr. <hi>K.</hi> who ſat at Table with me at the ſame time, bluſh'd, and
ask'd me, If I was not aſham'd to talk ſo? By which Expreſſions
he underſtood, that I meant the Maſter <hi>B—'d,</hi> theſe Two Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen;
for ſo the Word <hi>Ride,</hi> in his Iudgment, and that of
Debauch'd Perſons, as apply'd to Men does import. <hi>And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
added,</hi> That when I was charg'd with the Words, as above
Sworn to, before the Fellows, I deny'd indeed the Words, but ſaid,
<hi>I cou'd produce my Author.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:51443:12"/>
2. Mr. <hi>Deniſon</hi> backs his fellow Evidence Mr. <hi>Woods</hi> in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
particular, ſaving, <hi>he was not preſent, when I ſaid,</hi> I cou'd
produce my Author. And moreover, Swears, <hi>he heard me uſe
the Word</hi> Clapperclaw, <hi>as well as</hi> Ride, <hi>and the one, as well as
the other, in his Iudgment, ſignifies to</hi> B—r: And another
thing, <hi>That he had heard me call the Maſter</hi> Roger.</p>
            <p>3. Pricket <hi>Swears,</hi> I us'd to call him <hi>Pimp,</hi> and particularly
one time <hi>Pimp Maſter general</hi> to the Lodgings; and he thereby
underſtood, I meant he was turn'd Procurer for the Maſter.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>The Honourable Warden of</hi> All Souls <hi>Depos'd,</hi> That I
ſaid before the Delegates, in theſe, or ſuch like Words to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect;
If I had ſaid the Words above mention'd, <hi>I had my Author</hi>
for them; <hi>and again,</hi> That when <hi>I</hi> was ask'd by one of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,
Whether I would clear my ſelf upon Oath, <hi>I anſwer'd, I
wou'd not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Depoſitions being thus ſet down, I am firſt to make
Anſwer to them as they are Alledg'd to ſet forth matter of
Scandal and Defamation upon the Reverend Dr. <hi>Charlett,</hi> and
the Reverend Mr. <hi>Tanner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I. To begin with the laſt Witneſs firſt (for if, what this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Gentleman ſays, ſeems to imply, I have either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt,
or cou'd not deny the Charge, there's an end of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute.)
As to the Story about the Editors, I own'd both before
the Fellows, and before the Delegates, I had heard it, tho'
not any time this 4, or 5 Years, and for that, I told them my
Author, Mr. <hi>M.</hi> but that I ever mention'd ſuch a Story my
ſelf, or heard theſe Words the Two Witneſſes Swore to, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from Mr. <hi>M.</hi> or any body elſe, ſo apply'd, I always flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deny'd.</p>
            <p>1 That I did not ſay this Clauſe [<hi>If I had ſaid ſo, I had my
Author for't</hi>] before the Delegates, with reſpect to the Words
Sworn againſt me, as Mr. Warden wou'd have it, is evident,
becauſe, this is the very thing ſome miſinform'd one of the
Reverend Doctors of, at the Viſitation, and he earneſtly tax'd
me with; I was very poſitive in my Anſwer, That I never had
ſaid ſuch a thing, and complain'd to Mr. <hi>Hinckley,</hi> and he to
Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> of the miſ-information given in againſt me: Mr.
<hi>Smith</hi> own'd it a Miſtake, and went, very honeſtly, when all
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:51443:12"/>
was over, to have it Corrected: And it cannot be ſuppos'd,
that I ſhou'd make a confeſſion of a thing, and at the ſame
time vouch and prove a denyal of it too.</p>
            <p>2. That I did not ſay ſo upon my Examination before the
Fellows, as Mr. <hi>Woods</hi> Alledges, and as ſome miſinform'd one
of the Reverend Doctors, is likewiſe evident becauſe, Mr.
<hi>Smith</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hudſon,</hi> beſides the Two other Fellows, Mr.
<hi>Naylor</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hinckley,</hi> who both agree I ſaid no ſuch thing,
at the time ſpoken of, being call'd to deliver upon Oath,
what paſt before them in the Maſter's Lodgings, did neither of
them, agreeably to what Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> had before own'd to
Mr. <hi>Hinckley</hi> at the Viſitation, mention a Syllable of this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
which if I had ſaid, they cou'd not in that time have
forgot it, nor wou'd have omitted to relate what was ſo appo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
to the purpoſe.</p>
            <p>3. As to the Second Clauſe of Mr. Warden's Evidence, 'Tis
true, I was ask'd, and Mr. Warden himſelf, as I remember,
<hi>whether I wou'd clear my ſelf upon Oath?</hi> I returned, and
the Reverend the Principal of <hi>Jeſus</hi> was pleaſed to joyn with
me, <hi>I conceiv'd I was not obliged to anſwer to that Queſtion;</hi>
and ſo I anſwer ſtill, becauſe if I ſhou'd ſwear, and that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſo righteouſly, I ſhou'd not perhaps eſcape Cenſure, which
notwithſtanding the ill Opinion ſome are pleaſed to harbour of
me, I ſhou'd be very loath to incur for a Fellowſhip.</p>
            <p>II. As to <hi>Pricket</hi> the Butler (that I may diſpatch him
out of the way) this is the Man that I more than ſuſpected
did always abuſe and miſrepreſent me to the Maſter; and I
ever did, and ſtill do from my Conſcience believe him to have
been the occaſion all along of the Maſter's Prejudice, and
Averſion towards me, and the better part of the College, when
they dare once talk freely, will tell you the ſame. Whether
hereupon, I might be apt ſometimes to call him <hi>Pimp,</hi> I
cannot juſtly ſay; but that he ſhou'd underſtand, or at leaſt
I mean the Word in the ſenſe ſet down, neither will any
body believe, when I have told the Paſſage which he at large
related to the Court.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I came</hi> (he ſays) <hi>into the Buttery one time, about a Year and a half
ago, and finding myſelf Sconced</hi> Six Pence <hi>by the Maſter's Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51443:13"/>
I fell immediately a ſcolding very furiouſly with him, and told
him, he was always running to the Maſter with one idle Story or
other, and I ſuppos'd this was the reſult of one of them? But I
vow'd I wou'd not ask it off, and he might tell the Maſter ſo, if
he wou'd, for he was</hi> Pimp Maſter General <hi>to the Lodgings.</hi>
The Expreſſions, which I here in a paſſion, and upon a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
threw out, I muſt with ſhame own, are Rude and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpectful;
but no body, I dare ſay, wou'd make any doubt,
what I meant here by the Name <hi>Pimp,</hi> the fore-going Words
too plainly ſhew, I meant, <hi>he us'd to carry Stories to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi>
and had juſt been telling ſome one or other of me, which
caus'd the Maſter to <hi>Sconce</hi> me: And <hi>Pricket</hi> too, to be ſure,
underſtood it aright, for he had but upon Election Day, when
he was purpoſely Examin'd, as to what he knew, concerning
this Particular, given under his own Hand, <hi>That he knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all relating to't, but what he had heard from Mr.</hi>
Woods, <hi>and Mr.</hi> Deniſon. But he ventur'd it ſeems, to ſtrain a
Point, to ſerve his Old Friend at parting, and kindly help me for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
when I was going.</p>
            <p>3. Theſe Two being diſpatch'd, I come to Examine the joint
Depoſitions of Mr. <hi>Woods,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Deniſon.</hi> which before I enter
upon, I cannot but complain to you, that I ſhou'd be oblig'd
to Anſwer to any thing the later of theſe Two Gentlemen
thinks fit to Swear againſt me: For when he Swore againſt me
before the Delegatas, What was he doing but Swearing me
out of the Fellowſhip to make room for himſelf? This the
Right Reverend the Late Biſhop of <hi>Oxford</hi> was very well aware
of, and therefore, as I am told, ask'd at that time, <hi>Whether
if the Fellowſhip ſhou'd happen to be be declar'd Vacant, Mr.</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſon
<hi>wou'd not become a Candidate for't?</hi> And it was anſwer'd
by the Maſter, or ſome of his Friends, <hi>No, no:</hi> But 'twas ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd,
when Mr. <hi>Deniſon</hi> was afterwards Elected That, that
Worthy Perſon, with ſome others, did not come to approve of
him. And now again when he appears a Witneſs againſt me
in the Vice-Chancellor's Court, What does he elſe but Swear
me out of the Univerſity, the better to ſecure himſelf in his
Fellowſhip? 'Tis doubly hard upon me therefore, that he
ſhou'd be allow'd not only to Swear me out of the Fellowſhip
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51443:13"/>
to make room for himſelf, but ſuffer'd to Swear to keep him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in't: But before all be done, you'll eaſily perceive, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
my telling of you, that Mr. <hi>Deniſon</hi> is more than ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
intereſted in the matter.</p>
            <p>Allowing then, that Mr. <hi>Deniſon,</hi> and his intimate Cronie
Mr. <hi>Woods,</hi> heard Words repeated for near a Month together, at
a publick Table, which no body there preſent, beſides them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
too, ever heard once, no not that very Gentleman, who,
they ſay, made anſwer to them, and rebuk'd me for them (tho'
I muſt own at the ſame time he told me ſo, he added, what I
cannot very well tell whether it makes more for, or againſt
me, <hi>That if he had heard them, he ſhou'd not have thought it
worth his while to have remembred them:</hi>) allowing, I ſay, what
I can by no means grant to be true, yet neither do theſe Words
of themſelves ſignifie what the Witneſſes wou'd make us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive,
nor are there any Circumſtances, or Reaſons ſufficient
for their wreſting of them to ſuch a ſignification: And laſtly,
If all this was granted, yet the term of Time limited for the
Action, is already elaps'd, the Words having been ſpoken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
a Year ago.</p>
            <p>1. Who thoſe Looſe and Debauch'd Perſons are, with whom
to <hi>Clapperclaw</hi> and <hi>Ride,</hi> paſs current for ſuch Obſcene Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
Mr. <hi>Woods</hi> and Mr. <hi>Deniſon,</hi> it ſeems, know beſt. To
<hi>Clapperclaw,</hi> wherever I read, or heard the Expreſſion, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
no more than to Whip and Beat one. So <hi>Hudibraſs,</hi> 2 <hi>Can.</hi>
2 Part p. 280.
<q>
                  <l>—The inward Man,</l>
                  <l>And outward, like Clan and Clan,</l>
                  <l>Have always been at Daggers drawing,</l>
                  <l>And one another Clapperclawing.</l>
                  <l>Not that they really Cuff and Fence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

you:</hi> So to <hi>Ride,</hi> is often transferr'd from its common and
uſual ſignification of <hi>managing a Horſe,</hi> to that of <hi>managing a
Man,</hi> or ruling him, <hi>ad libitum &amp; arbitrium,</hi> as <hi>Prieſt Ridden,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51443:14"/>
The Rich Ride the Poor;</hi> and what makes the Expreſſion more
proper in this Caſe, is, the Maſter himſelf has been heard to
uſe it, ſaying, <hi>He cou'd Ride ſuch an one.</hi> Since the Words
then do not of themſelves ſignifie what the Witneſſes ſuggeſt,
where are the Circumſtances and Reaſons for the wreſting of
them to ſuch a ſignification?</p>
            <p>1. Say they, <hi>The Words were ſpoken about a Month or ſix
Weeks after Mr.</hi> Clavering' <hi>s Election, and 'tis to be ſuppos'd, you
might ſpeak them in the Senſe alledg'd, out of Reſentment, and
by way of Revenge upon the Maſter, becauſe you was at that time
laid aſide.</hi> In Anſwer to this, I muſt obſerve to you, That theſe
Two Witneſſes Swore before the Delegates<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to about a Year and
half ago, without any relation, or reference had to Mr. <hi>Claver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>'s
Election, or ſo much as mention'd: But before Mr. Vice-Chancellor,
Mr. <hi>Deniſon,</hi> to bring them nearer to Mr. <hi>Clavering</hi>'s
Election, Dated the Words in <hi>April</hi> 97. a Quarter of a Year
higher than before, and Swore to them with expreſs reference to
that Election; I ſay, Mr. <hi>Deniſon,</hi> for tho' <hi>Mr. Woods</hi> did equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
advance the Date of the Words with <hi>Mr. Deniſon,</hi> and ſay,
<hi>The Words were ſpoken indeed, after Mr.</hi> Clavering's <hi>Election.</hi>
Yet he wou'd not ſuggeſt that they bore any relation to that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection;
whereas <hi>Mr. Deniſon</hi> was pleas'd to ſay, <hi>I was vex'd,
he believ'd, becauſe the Maſter at that time did not Vote for me,
and thence I came to utter ſuch words againſt him:</hi> But <hi>Mr. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſon,</hi>
you muſt underſtand, by this time was Elected into the
Fellowſhip, therefore no wonder if he thought himſelf obliged
to go beyond his Brother Witneſs, and do ſomething Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
upon his Promotion. However it is well known, if I
had reaſon to Quarrel with any body upon that Election, it was
myſelf, or ſome of my beſt Friends; I had had long e'er this
too too great Experience of the Maſter's Averſion towards me,
ever to hope for his Vote at the Election of a Fellow, and it
is not probable, that I ſhould be much vexed to find I had miſs'd
of that, which I durſt neither hope for, nor expect. Beſides,
if I had been ſo wickedly minded, as Mr <hi>Deniſon</hi> gives out, I
think, I ſhou'd ſcarce have choſen either thoſe Words, or
that Place, he talks of, to have expreſt my malice in, but
Words more ſerious, and a Place more private, and judg'd it
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:51443:14"/>
more both for my purpoſe, and ſafety ſo to have done. Laſt
of all, Wou'd I have brought in a Man, whom all the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
ſo deſervedly Eſteem, and whoſe intimate Acquaintance
I ſtill pride myſelf ſo much in, to have been a ſharer in this
Scandalous Report; for ſuch is the Gentleman, they tell you, I
I directed my Diſcourſe to at Table, and whom, as well as
Mr. <hi>Tanner,</hi> it ſeems, I ſaid the Mr. <hi>Clapperclawed.</hi> The frank
and open manner then in which, they ſay, I deliver'd myſelf,
and the tenderneſs and regard every body has for the Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his Friend, might have ſufficiently declar'd the innocence
of my Thoughts, whatever ſenſe, or interpretation they had
thought fit to put upon the Words.</p>
            <p>2. Say they, <hi>And what does plainly demonſtrate your meaning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
theſe Words, you confeſs that Mr.</hi> M. <hi>told you, That the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
B—'d the Editors, and what he calls B—ing, you call
Clapperclawing.</hi> You, ſee Sir, what advantage they are pleas'd
to take of my Honeſty and Simplicity, and juſt ſuch uſe wou'd
they have made of my Submiſſion. But to the purpoſe; Mr. <hi>M</hi>
told me once an idle Jeſt of the Maſter and Editors, which
neither he, nor any body elſe, took any further notice of: About
Two, or Three Years after, I happen'd to talk concerning the
Maſter, Mr. <hi>Tanner,</hi> and another Perſon, muſt I therefore
needs allude to a Story told me ſo long ago, wherein neither
Mr. <hi>Tanner,</hi> nor this Gentleman's Name, was ſo much as men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd,
and in ſuch Words too, as are confeſſedly Prov'd to
imply no ſuch thing, as this Story expreſt. If this does any
way demonſtrate my meaning, it muſt demonſtrate it to be
ſomewhat elſe ſure, than what theſe Gentlemen wou'd have
it.</p>
            <p>What remains therefore, but that the Words, if ſpoken, ſhou'd
be conſtru'd in their uſual and common acceptation, which, as
before prov'd, will amount to no more than this; Here's one
Scholar falls to Rally another of his Acquaintance, and tells
him, <hi>The Maſter governs and manages him as he pleaſes, juſt
as he does Mr.</hi> Tanner (for Mr. <hi>Tanner</hi> was ever known to
be very obſervant of the Maſter, but there was no ſuch Report
as now there is, till Mr. <hi>Woods</hi> and Mr. <hi>Deniſon</hi> miſconſtruing
theſe Words of mine, as they pretend, found it of late for their
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51443:15"/>
intereſt, to ſet it about, and in very expreſs Terms) <hi>he gives him
gentle correction to keep him in due order and ſubmiſſion:</hi> And
what's all this but ſome Taunts and Jeers, ſuch as paſs often
merrily and innocently enough amongſt Young Scholars, which
the Gentleman being offended at it, asks the t'other, <hi>Whether
he's not aſham'd to talk ſo?</hi> And in this, or the like Senſe muſt
the Witneſſes too, after all, have underſtood the Phraſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
mention'd, for Mr. <hi>Woods,</hi> and he indeed is the only
Perſon to be regarded, being ask'd in Court, Whether during
the ſeveral times he heard me repeat them at Table, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
took them in a looſe, immodeſt Senſe? Anſwer'd, as will
be Atteſted by Three credible Perſons than preſent, <hi>Sometimes
he did, and ſometimes again he did not;</hi> Notwithſtanding all
the Circumſtances and Reaſons which they pretend to.</p>
            <p>3. And to conclude this part, Admitting that the Words
were never ſo expreſs, yet the Civil Law, which is the Rule of
their Judgment in the Vice-Chacellour's Court, ſays, <hi>Injuria
verbalis ſolvitur ſpatio anni utilis;</hi> the term of time then limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for the Action is already elapſed, the Words, according
to their own Evidence, having been ſpoken almoſt two Years
ago, unleſs the Maſter can firſt make it appear, that he never
heard of them till ſometime within this Year: I ſay, and I
crave leave to inſiſt upon't, tho' the Words were never ſo Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
yet the Maſter, before in Law he can recover any Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
or exact any Puniſhment of me for ſpeaking of them,
muſt firſt make it appear he never heard of them till ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
within this Year, which if he can do it, is one great
Argument to me they never were ſpoken at all.</p>
            <p>Thus much then for the Words as they are Actionable, and
relate my Expulſion: come I to the Second thing propoſed,
Namely;</p>
            <p>II. To make Anſwer to them as they are alledged to ſet
forth an Objection againſt my Manners and Behaviour, and ſo
relate my Reprobation. And here I might juſtly be thought to
have prevented all further trouble in this Particular, ſince what
is not proved can be no reaſonable Exception againſt me; and
how far their Proof falls ſhort, I have already obſerved to
you: But becauſe the Learned Dr. <hi>Boucher</hi> ſays, <hi>That Viſitors
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51443:15"/>
in this Caſe need not wait for a ſtrict and legal Proof, but may
proceed</hi> Juxta conſcientias, <hi>and according to their Belief,</hi> I ſhall,
allowing all my Adverſaries urge in this Particular to be true,
fairly ſtate the Matter, and leave the <hi>Convocation</hi> to agree what
Rule they had beſt be guided by, the Law, the common Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard
of Juſtice, or their own private Opinions; and whether,
if they do perchance believe me guilty of a few nonſenſical
Words, they may not notwithſtanding, in Reaſon and Diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
admit me Fellow of a College.</p>
            <p>To allow then what my Proſecutors were never yet able to
prove, <hi>I happened unluckily in jeſting now and then with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Acquaintance of mine,</hi> (a Gentleman who wants neither
Senſe of Honour nor Gratitude to vindicate either his own or
the Maſter's Reputation where he ſhou'd perceive them injur'd)
<hi>to allude in ſome odd comical Language to a fooliſh Story, which
I had once heard of the Maſter and Editors;</hi> and is this then
ſuch an unpardonable Offence in Youth, ſometimes to have
talked raſhly and indiſcreetly by way of Merriment and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
his Companions, that, almoſt two Years, after he ſhall
for this, and for this alone, be turned out of a Fellowſhip which
he has honourably and fairly been Elected into? If I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
ſuch a thing as this of the Maſter abroad, or by ſecret
Whiſpers and ſlie Suggeſtions inſinuated the truth of it, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
our ſelves, and in our own College, well might I then
have been deem'd an unworthy Member of a Civil and Ingenuous
Society: but ſince, at worſt, I happen'd only to throw out a few
odd ridiculous Words, which no Body ever after ſo much as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred,
except Mr. <hi>Woods</hi> and Mr. <hi>Deniſon,</hi> nor they think fit to
inform of them till at length for their own private advantage
more than for any diſrepute, which, they ſaw, had befallen the
Maſter; as I have already ſhewn: In a Word, ſince it appears
that, if I did ſpeak theſe Words, I neither deſigned nor inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
any harm, either to the Maſter or any body elſe, nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
did they ever receive any, I think I have done enough,
if not to ſatisfie Dr. <hi>Charlett,</hi> yet, to wipe away the Objection,
and acquit my ſelf as a good Chriſtian in that, when the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
thought ſit to inſiſt upon this Offence, <hi>I offered more than
once to ask his Pardon in what manner he pleaſed, or ſubmit to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:51443:16"/>
any puniſhment he wou'd inflict;</hi> Nay, after he had got me turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Fellowſhip, and for one and the ſame Fault, was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Expell me the Univerſity, nevertheleſs I readily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to as fair a Character of him and Mr. <hi>Tanner,</hi> as their
Friends thought fit to give them, and publickly declar'd in
open Court, <hi>I never thought or imagined them guilty of the
Crimes they were pleaſed to think themſelves accuſed of:</hi> And
now, if either of theſe Two Gentlemen will pleaſe to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
me any other method whereby I may clear their Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
in this particular more effectually than hitherto I have
done, I promiſe them, after all, inſtantly to ſet about it; for
God forbid that it ſhou'd be ſaid, that I in any wiſe, in
any manner had occaſioned ſuch a groundleſs Report to be
ſpread abroad of any Man, and ſhou'd not be willing by all
means poſſible to clear him of the Scandal of it: But it is
eaſie for any to obſerve that Dr. <hi>Charlett</hi> needed neither to
have broke the Peace of the College, nor been thus injurious
to me, if he had not deſign'd ſomething more, than the vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
his own Reputation.</p>
            <p>I have now I think, at length gon, thorough all the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
brought to prevent my being Approv'd, ſaving, that the
Two Witneſſes laſt mention'd, do ſomewhere or other add, <hi>That
they have heard me talk againſt the Diſcipline of the Houſe;</hi> Mr.
<hi>Deniſon,</hi> for inſtance, <hi>at the</hi> Three Tun-<hi>Tavern;</hi> (for as to
that particular, of ſaying, <hi>The Maſter Rogered ſuch an one,</hi>
which Mr. <hi>Woods</hi> Swore to before the Delegates, but Mr. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſon</hi>
and he, do both contradict afterwards in Court, ſaying,
I call'd the Maſter only bare <hi>Roger,</hi> I ſhall wave my Anſwer
to't till they Swear a Third time, to fix the Allegation) what
it was thoſe Gentlemen heard me talk againſt the Diſcipline of
the Houſe, ſince they have not thought fit to tell, I am not able to
ſhall only therefore, in the Concluſion, obſerve to you, how ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
I am dealt with, when every idle Word, which Two
Deſigning Perſons have at one time or other heard to drop from
me concerning the Maſter, or the Diſcipline of the Houſe,
ſhou'd paſs current, for a mighty Exception againſt me, whilſt
my conſtant Obedience and Submiſſion both to the one and the
other lie all the while unregarded.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:51443:16"/>
The Sum of the whole is this, The Maſter, as a certain Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
if you will not take my Word for't, in due time and
place will make it appear upon Oath, <hi>was reſolv'd Three Years
ago and upwards, that I ſhoud never ſucceed Fellow of</hi> Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
<hi>College, if he cou'd hinder.</hi> Hence, no doubt on't, came all
that Rigor and Severity which, as I have ſaid, upon little, or
no occaſion he us'd to Treat me with, that, ſince the ordinary
Courſe of my Life and Converſation, was not greatly to
be complain'd of, he might happily provoke me by ill Uſage,
to ſay, or do what he might afterwards take advantage of:
And hence it was, after all his Pretences, he did not ſtick to deny
me my Degree, which at the Expence of my Time and Fortune,
I was now become capable of, becauſe that wou'd have been
one good argument more at the Election, for my preference to
Mr. <hi>Deniſon;</hi> inſomuch, that it's juſtly queſtion'd, Whether
or no, a <hi>Bachelor of Arts</hi> is capable of being Elected at all? And
now when Examinations, with which, he had threatn'd me ſo
ſeverely, were happily concluded, and all his other Slanders
and Reproaches of me (for ſo, I hope, I may ſafely call all
his other Objections, ſince every Fellow in the Houſe accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them ſuch) were laid aſide and diſregarded, purſuant to
his former Reſolution, he caſts about, and enquires after ſuch
Stuff and Giberage, as you have heard: I ſay Enquires after for
I cannot conceive, with what Confidence, <hi>Wanly, Deniſon,</hi> or
whoever of them was the Informer, cou'd go and pretend, as
he muſt do, great damage and injury done the Maſter's Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by a Story which he himſelf had knowingly, and wilfully
conceal'd for ſo long together, unleſs the Maſter had firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
after this or the like matter, or given him ſome private
Encouragement ſo to do; nor would he, when he had once
found what he thought he cou'd make an Objection of, admit
of any Satisfaction, or Submiſſion, of what kind ſoever; No, not
when it was offer'd him by all the Fellows of the Houſe; nor
wou'd he by any means be prevail'd upon amicably to Adjuſt,
or Comprimiſe the Matter within his own Society, but muſt
hurry me away before the <hi>Heads of Houſes,</hi> to have me turn'd
out of my Fellowſhip, and Expell'd the Univerſity, for a Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Story which, in ſpight of all I cou'd do, or ſay, he wou'd
both Prove and Publiſh to his own Diſcredit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:51443:17"/>
Being therefore put by my <hi>Degree,</hi> if for any at all, for a
Reaſon which, if I had been Candidly dealt with, ſhou'd rather
have haſten'd than have ſtop'd my promotion to't; and being
for a Reaſon as good as the former, <hi>i. e.</hi> for Words of a general
and doubtful ſignification, and ſuch, as by the Conſtruction of
all the Law in the World, can never be made Criminal, depriv'd
of my Free-hold, Expell'd the Univerſity, and turn'd out into
the World to ſeek my Fortune; I have purpos'd, as I at firſt
told you, to Proſecute my Appeal to Convocation, who alone
can do me Right: Hoping that, that Venerable Body, will, as
their Predeceſſors in like Caſes, have done before them, Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
their Priviledge to their own Honour, and the comfort and
ſatisfaction of the Injur'd. Nor does Expulſion, as far as I
can underſtand, at all weaken my Right of Appealing, how
craftily ſoever it was deſign'd to deſtroy it. The Univerſity,
and a College, I am told, are Two diſtinct Corporations, and
I may forfeit the Priviledge of the one, and retain the Right
of the other. The King has Power to Found a College in the
Univerſity, but he cannot make the Members of his College,
Members of the Univerſity; that requires an Act of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation,
to Receive and Incorporate them into the Univerſity.
We have a Modern Inſtance of this, <hi>Worceſter</hi>-College has all
the Rights of a College, that is, <hi>By the King's Letters Parents</hi>
it is become a <hi>Corporation;</hi> but the Fellows of that College, as
ſuch, are not Members of the Univerſity: So that the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges
of the Univerſity, and of a College may ſubſiſt apart, and
the Right of the one, may be enjoy'd by him who is no Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the other. Otherwiſe indeed, a Fellowſhip wou'd be
a very precarious thing, if a Man muſt be depriv'd of it when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
a <hi>Maſter of a College</hi> in his Paſſion, or Prejudice, reſolv'd
to have him Expell'd. But this, with the Right of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation,
which otherwiſe, I had deſign'd herewithall to
have ſent you, being to be Argu'd ſpeedily in <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi>-Hall,
I ſhall not further enlarge upon't, but patiently
expect the Determination of the Court. Wiſhing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
whatever becomes of my Appeal, that Unanimity and
Concord may for ever flouriſh in that Society to which, upon
many Accounts, I am ſo much oblig'd to, and, that none ever
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:51443:17"/>
after me may have the like Reaſon to complain of Dr. <hi>Charlett,</hi>
