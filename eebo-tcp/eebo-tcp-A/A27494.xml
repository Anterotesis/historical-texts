         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hese <hi>two</hi> learned <hi>Speeches</hi> of the late <hi>Lord Primate Usher</hi> have been by some prudent persons judged seasonable to be thus published together. The <hi>one,</hi> Of the <hi>Kings Supremacy,</hi> may not only be instructive to those of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but to some of our <hi>own</hi> Communion, who have been and are too scanty in the acknowledgment of it. The <hi>other, Of the duty of Subjects to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the Kings necessities,</hi> was occasioned by the slowness in <hi>Ireland</hi> of contributing to the King, for the maintenance of the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> continued there for their own defence, the great imprudence of which parsimony,
<pb facs="tcp:52606:3"/>
we felt, to our own loss not many years after; wherein that distinction in point of Loyalty, made between those descended of the antient <hi>English</hi> race (though diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring from us in point of Religion) and those of the <hi>meer Irish</hi> (which is there much enlarged) may be now worthy of obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. The whole Speech is full of Loyalty, Prudence and Learning, for which, as he had his late <hi>Majesties</hi> (of Blessed Memory) gracious <hi>thanks,</hi> so he had as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle from others, who were then as back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in assenting to the like Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons here, conceiving he had pressed their <hi>duty</hi> too high in that point.</p>
            <p>Both these Speeches thus tending to the defence of <hi>Regal Power,</hi> and <hi>the duty of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,</hi> hath (in submission to the judgments of those whom I much reverence) occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned the putting forth <hi>a Sermon</hi> of mine upon the like Subject, which I have the rather adventured so near this eminent <hi>Primate,</hi> as having had his approbation oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned by the censure of some at <hi>Dublin, anno</hi> 1642. when it was first delivered; of
<pb facs="tcp:52606:3"/>
which more is said in an Advertisement before it.</p>
            <p>Hereupon I have been further induced unto a <hi>vindication</hi> of the said most eminent <hi>Prelate</hi> not only of His Judgment in this Subject, but in point of <hi>Episcopacy, Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,</hi> and <hi>Constitutions</hi> of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> from the various misapprehensions of such, who being of different opinions, the great respect given him by the <hi>one,</hi> hath been a scandal to the <hi>other:</hi> But by this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial relation of his Judgment and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice in each, it may be hoped that <hi>both</hi> sorts will be so fully satisfyed as to unite in the exemplary observance of that <hi>Piety, Loyalty, Conformity,</hi> and <hi>Humility</hi> found in him.</p>
            <p>And whereas some do much appeal to that <hi>Accommodation</hi> of his in relation to <hi>Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy</hi> (wherein he was not single) propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>Anno</hi> 1640. (which then they did not hearken unto) they are herein remembred what was that which caused it, even the pressing <hi>violence</hi> of those times, threatning the destruction of the <hi>whole,</hi> with the sole end of it, a <hi>pacification,</hi> whose readiness
<pb facs="tcp:52606:4"/>
in yielding up so much of his own Interest then, for the tranquility of the Church (like <hi>Jonas</hi> willing to be cast overboard for the stilling of the Tempest) would be worthy of all our <hi>Imitations</hi> now. The ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale here is from that <hi>Storm,</hi> unto what his <hi>practice</hi> was in <hi>calme</hi> and peaceable times, which if followed, would give a check to most of those disputes which have of late taken up so much time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fruite</hi> expected to be reaped from this declaration (besides the satisfaction of mine own mind, which was not at rest without it) is the due <hi>honor</hi> of him, for whose I am oblieged to sacrifice mine own. That as he is admired <hi>abroad,</hi> so he may not want that love and general esteem he hath deserved at <hi>home.</hi> And as the <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>unity</hi> of the Church was studied by him in his <hi>life</hi> time, so there might not be the least breach continued by a misapprehension of him after his <hi>death.</hi> And surely if such of us who think him worthy of being our <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,</hi> would but now upon the sight of this,
<pb facs="tcp:52606:4"/>
writ after him the <hi>Arke</hi> of our Church would cease to be tossed too and fro in this <hi>floating</hi> uncertain condition, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately rest upon firm ground.</p>
            <p>Heretofore, having an occasion to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate this most Learned Primate in point of <hi>Doctrine</hi> (so unhappy often are persons of his eminency, as after their deaths to be challenged Patrons to contrary partyes) I had <hi>An.</hi> 1658. a Letter of Thanks from the late Reverend Bishop of <hi>Durham</hi> (Bishop <hi>Morton)</hi> in these wordes, <hi>viz. I acknowledge hereby my obligation of Thankfulness to you, not only for the book it self, but especially for your pains, in vindicating that admirable Saint of God, and Starr,</hi> primae magnitudinis, <hi>in the Church of God, the Primate of Armagh, &amp;c.</hi> In which high esteem of the <hi>Primate,</hi> the now <hi>Reverend Bish. of Durham</hi> succeeds him, who hath often signified it, in divers of his Letters which I receiued from <hi>Paris</hi> to that purpose.</p>
            <p>Hereunto <hi>two</hi> other <hi>Treatises</hi> have been thought fit to be added (mentioned in the foresaid vindication (but then not intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb facs="tcp:52606:5"/>
to be published) which the Eminent Primate had a hand in. The one, Mr. Hookers <hi>Judgment of Regal Power,</hi> in <hi>Matters of Religion, the advancement of Bishops, and the Kings Exemption from censure &amp;c.</hi> Left out of the common copyes <hi>inlarged</hi> and <hi>confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> by the <hi>Primate,</hi> all the marginal notes of the quotations out of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his own hand, are noted with this mark*</p>
            <p>The other a Treatise of the <hi>Form of Church Government before and after Christ, &amp;c.</hi> The main aime of it is to shew, that the Government of the Christian Church e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished by the Apostles under the <hi>New</hi> Testament was according to the pattern of that in the <hi>Old,</hi> then which scarce any book in so <hi>little,</hi> speaks so <hi>much,</hi> for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminency of Episcopacy. It first appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Anno</hi> 1641. under the Title of the <hi>rude draughts of Bishop</hi> Andrews, (which though I was in doubt of, by the contrary opinion of an eminent person, (heretofore near unto him) yet I am confirmed in it by what I find written by that Learned Bishop

               <hi>Bishop,</hi> that the abovesaid <hi>Rude Draught</hi> was wrote by the hand of <hi>Bishop Andrews</hi> own <hi>Secretary,</hi> and that the said Bishop did deliver it himself to the <hi>Primate,</hi> Anno 1640. who, though it came in that imperfect condition, yet finding so many excellent observations wrought out with very great industry, he judged it forth with, as it was, worthy of the Press: But afterwards upon a further review, he added his strength to the perfecting of it, which I found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst his papers done throughout with his own hand, and with it a <hi>Manuscript</hi> of the same, corrected accordingly by him. And in the conclusion of that, a very <hi>learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hand</hi> had contributed to it also, signify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by markes refering to several Pages, what he would have <hi>added, altered,</hi> or <hi>fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enquired</hi> into, Now whether the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of that be Bishop <hi>Andrews,</hi> or some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther learned person, I shall not determine, only seeing it was his custom in what he published (as I am assured) first to write a <hi>rough draught,</hi> then after some distance of time to take a <hi>review,</hi> and a third before it
<pb facs="tcp:52606:6"/>
passed his hand, this might be the <hi>second,</hi> and the <hi>third</hi> supplyed by the <hi>Lord Primate,</hi> wherein the last desire of the Author hath been satisfied, he not only inquiring into, but clearing those difficulties in <hi>Chorography</hi> and <hi>Chronology,</hi> which I have in their due pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces inserted, with the learned additions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned. So that whether the whole be the labour of those two eminent <hi>Prelats</hi> (the one laying the <hi>Foundation,</hi> the other <hi>building</hi> upon it) or be a three <hi>fold cord,</hi> it is here faithfully presented without any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition or addition, even where there seemed to be some small imperfection which in a few places do occurre, all which some years agon Doctor <hi>Brounrigg</hi> the late <hi>Bishop of</hi> Exeter, upon the view of gave me his judgment for the publishing of them.</p>
            <p>I have only this to add, That for every particular passage in the whole, I have no warrant to intitle the <hi>Primates</hi> judgment to it. Only it is apparent by his great pains in the double correction, and supply made by himself in some Specialties, he had a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb facs="tcp:52606:7"/>
great valew of it. The <hi>Primates Annotations</hi> are noted with this <hi>marke</hi>*. And the <hi>sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed Authors</hi> additions and changes are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with this <hi>mark</hi> [] though in some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
            <p>Lastly, finding among the said <hi>Primates</hi> papers a Letter of D. HADRIANUS de SARA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIA to the Ministers of the Isle of <hi>Garnsey,</hi> (which I cannot hear was ever published.) I have thought fit to add also, the Subject being so near a kin to the former, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning both the KINGS POWER, EPIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>COPACY, and the CONSTITUTIONS of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> whose advice to them many years agon, may be of good use to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers now.</p>
            <p>I have no more, but to wish that the Judgment of these eminent Authors may be so prevalent with others, much inferior to them, that they may be moved accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly to <hi>study quietness, and seek those ways of peace,</hi> which of latter years <hi>we have not known.</hi>

in setting them forth, neither <hi>better</hi> nor <hi>worse,</hi> but just as he found them in the <hi>Reverend Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate's</hi> Paper, some <hi>perfect,</hi> and some <hi>imperfect,</hi> according as they were, and still are in the <hi>Copies</hi> which are in his custody, and which he is ready up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all occasions to shew, if need shall require.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:52606:10"/>
much satisfaction to the impartial Reader, and done good service to <hi>the Church of God.</hi> Yet rather then a Tract of so much <hi>usefulness</hi> should not be publickly known to the World, the Publisher in order to <hi>the publick good,</hi> thought fit (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing whatsoever <hi>defects</hi> it may have for want of the Authors <hi>last hand</hi> thereunto) to joyn it with the rest in this <hi>Edition,</hi> especially <hi>the Learned Primate</hi> having had it under his <hi>File,</hi> as by <hi>the Notes</hi> and other <hi>Additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> written with the <hi>Primates</hi> own hand (which I have seen and can testifie) doth plainly appear. The same also is to be said of the <hi>three</hi> pieces of the renowned <hi>Hooker,</hi> and of what is written with the same hand in the Margent of <hi>the Manuscript Copie,</hi> whereof some ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count is given, <hi>pag. 47.</hi>

            <p>Great pity it is, if it could be holpen, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing which fell from the Pen of any of these <hi>Four Worthies</hi> should be lost. But where <hi>the entire Work</hi> cannot be retrived; it is pity but (as in a <hi>Shipwrack</hi> at Sea, or <hi>Scath-fire</hi> by land) so much of it should be saved as can be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, be it <hi>more</hi> or <hi>lesse.</hi> Those men have been always thought to have deserved well of <hi>the</hi>

            <p>What the Reverend <hi>Doctor</hi> hath <hi>added</hi> of his own, as touching the Learned <hi>Primates</hi> Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Premises, and <hi>confirmed</hi> the same by instancing in sundry <hi>particulars</hi> under those three <hi>Generall Heads;</hi> and that, from his own perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>knowledge,</hi> and long <hi>experience</hi> (having for divers years lived <hi>under</hi> or <hi>near</hi> him) is <hi>in the general</hi> very well known to my self and many others, who have sundry times heard him, as <hi>occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> was given, deliver <hi>his opinion</hi> clearly in every of the aforesaid <hi>points,</hi> which were then grown to be the whole <hi>Subject</hi> (in a manner) of <hi>the common discourse</hi> of the times. But one <hi>particular</hi> I shall mention, which above the rest I perfectly <hi>remember,</hi> as taking more <hi>special notice</hi> of it when it was <hi>spoken</hi> then of the rest, because I had never heard it observed by any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and having my self oftentimes since <hi>spoken</hi> of it to others upon several occasions; which for that it hath given satisfaction to <hi>some,</hi> I think it my duty to make it known to as many <hi>others</hi> as I
<pb facs="tcp:52606:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
can, by acquainting the <hi>Reader</hi> with it, and it concerneth the Ceremony of <hi>the Cross after Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme,</hi> as it is enjoyned by <hi>Law,</hi> and practised in <hi>the Church of England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The use of this <hi>Ceremony</hi> had been so fully <hi>declared,</hi> and (as to the point of <hi>Superstition</hi> where with some had <hi>charged</hi> it) so abundantly <hi>vindicated,</hi> both in <hi>the Canons</hi> of the Church, and other <hi>writings</hi> of Learned men, that before the beginning of <hi>the Long Parliament,</hi> and the unhappy Divisions that followed thereupon, there were <hi>very few</hi> in the whole Nation (scarce here and there <hi>one)</hi> either of <hi>the Ministers</hi> that made <hi>scruple</hi> to use it, or of <hi>the People</hi> that took <hi>offence</hi> at it. But after that some leading men of <hi>the House of Commons</hi> in that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, for the better driving on the design they had upon <hi>the King,</hi> had let all loose in <hi>the Church,</hi> whilst some few <hi>stood fast</hi> to their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Principles (and were most of them <hi>undone</hi> by it) the greatest part of <hi>the Clergy</hi> (to their shame be it spoken) <hi>many</hi> for fear of loosing <hi>their own, more</hi> in hope to get <hi>other mens livings,</hi> and some possibly out of their simplicity beguiled with the specious name of <hi>Reformation,</hi> in a
<pb facs="tcp:52606:12"/>
short space became either such perfect <hi>Time-Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> as to <hi>cry down,</hi> or such tame <hi>Complyers</hi> with the stronger Side, as to <hi>lay down</hi> ere they needed, the use of <hi>the whole Liturgy,</hi> and of all the <hi>Rites and Ceremonies</hi> therein prescribed. But among them ail none in the whole bunch so bitterly <hi>inveighed</hi> against, nor with such severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>anathematized,</hi> as this of <hi>the Cross,</hi> as smelling ranker of <hi>Popery &amp; Superstition</hi> then any of the rest, as it is even at this day by the Managers of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Interest represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as of all other, <hi>the greatest Stone</hi> of offence to <hi>tender Consciences,</hi> and <hi>the removal</hi> of it more insisted upon, then of all the other <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,</hi> by such men, as having engaged to <hi>plead</hi> in the behalf of other mens <hi>tender Consciences,</hi> do wisely consider withall, that it will not be so much for their own <hi>Credit,</hi> now to become Time-Servers <hi>with the Laws,</hi> as it was some years past for their <hi>profit</hi> to become Time-Servers <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Laws.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These <hi>out-cries</hi> against a poor <hi>Ceremony,</hi> to us (who were not able to discerne in it any thing of <hi>harme</hi> or <hi>Superstition,</hi> worthy of so much <hi>noise)</hi> afforded sometimes, when two or three of
<pb facs="tcp:52606:12"/>
us chanced to meet together, <hi>matter of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</hi> It hapned upon a time, that falling occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionally upon this <hi>Theme,</hi> the Learned <hi>Primate</hi> among other things said to us that were then casu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally present with him, that in his opinion <hi>the Sign of the Cross after Baptisme,</hi> as it is appointed <hi>in the Service-Book,</hi> and taken to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the words used there withall, was so far from being a Relike of Popery, that he verily believ'd the same to have been retained in <hi>the Church of England</hi> at the Reformation, of purpose to shew that the custom used in <hi>the Church of Rome,</hi> of giving <hi>the Chrisme</hi> to Infants immediately after their <hi>Baptisme,</hi> was in their Judgments neither <hi>necessary</hi> to be continued <hi>in all Churches,</hi> nor <hi>expedient</hi> to be observed <hi>in ours.</hi> Which his <hi>opinion,</hi> as it is most certainly <hi>true</hi> in the former, so to me it seemeth very <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable</hi> in the latter branch thereof.</p>
            <p>For <hi>first,</hi> how can that be with any truth affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, or but with the least colour of reason <hi>suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> to be a <hi>Popish</hi> Custom, or a Rag or Relike of <hi>Rome,</hi> that hath been for above <hi>a hundred years</hi> used (and that use by <hi>Law</hi> established) in <hi>the Protestant Church of England,</hi> but is
<pb facs="tcp:52606:13"/>
not at all used, nor (for ought I can learn) ever was used by <hi>the Papists</hi> in their <hi>Churches,</hi> nor is it by any Order or Authority of <hi>the Church of Rome</hi> enjoyned to be used in any <hi>Church</hi> in the world that professeth subjection thereunto. True it is, that in <hi>the Office of Baptisme,</hi> according to <hi>the Romane Ritual,</hi> the signe of <hi>the Cross</hi> is very often used, from first to last, at least twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty times <hi>(viz.</hi> in the Benediction of <hi>the Salt,</hi> in <hi>the Exorcismes,</hi> in the formal words <hi>of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration,</hi> and otherwise) yet as luck would have it, that <hi>signe</hi> is not made, nor by the <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> appointed to be made upon <hi>the Childs Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi> as with us is used: Nor are those <hi>very words</hi> therewithal used, nor <hi>other words</hi> to the like purpose by the said <hi>Ritual</hi> appointed to be so used (shewing what the <hi>intent, meaning</hi> and <hi>signification</hi> of that <hi>Sign</hi> is) as in our <hi>Service Book</hi> is done. And true it is also (for <hi>I wil not,</hi> as I think Iought <hi>not dissemble</hi> any thing that I can imagine might be advantagiously <hi>objected</hi> by an <hi>Adversary)</hi> that according to <hi>the Romane Order</hi> the <hi>Minister</hi> as soon as he hath finished <hi>the Baptisme (Ego baptizo te &amp;c.)</hi> is in the next place to <hi>annoint</hi> the Infant <hi>cross-wise,</hi>

It cannot therefore be the same with the <hi>Cross</hi> used in <hi>our Church,</hi> where the <hi>Chrisme</hi> is not at all used, but thought fit rather at <hi>the Reformation</hi> to be (I dare not say <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned</hi> as unlawful and superstitious, but) <hi>laid aside,</hi> as at least unnecessary and useless, as many other <hi>Ceremonies</hi> (still retained in <hi>the Church of Rome)</hi> were, because, though some of them were <hi>guiltless,</hi> yet they were grown so <hi>burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some</hi> by reason of their <hi>multitude,</hi> that it was fit <hi>the number</hi> of them should be abated.</p>

And yet <hi>secondly</hi> there might be, and (in the <hi>Primates</hi> judgment) probably there was a more <hi>peculiar Reason</hi> why after <hi>Baptisme</hi> our <hi>Church</hi> did substitute <hi>the signe of the Cross</hi> with the words thereto appertaining, in stead of <hi>the Chrisme</hi> and the Cross attending it, used in <hi>the Church of Rome.</hi> The Ceremony of give<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>the chrisme</hi> to Infants in all likelihood came into <hi>the church</hi> about the same time, when (through the misunderstanding of a passage in <hi>John 6. 53.) the opinion</hi> of the necessity of administring <hi>the Lords Supper</hi> to Infants had obtained in <hi>the christian church.</hi> And that <hi>(as it seemeth)</hi> to supply in some sort the want of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation</hi> wherein the like Ceremony of annoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with <hi>the chrisme</hi> was used) of which <hi>young children</hi> were not capable, and which yet was in all reason to precede the receiving of <hi>the Lords Supper.</hi> That <hi>opinion</hi> in time vanished as an <hi>Error,</hi> and with it <hi>the practise</hi> of communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Infants ceased. But still the custom of giving them the <hi>chrisme</hi> continued, as a kind of <hi>initial confirmation</hi> (if I may so call it) as if by it were conferred some degree of that <hi>grace,</hi> which in their account) is the proper effect of <hi>the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:52606:15"/>
of confirmation, <hi>to wit, the grace of</hi> Spiritual Strength, <hi>to fight against</hi> the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Enemie <hi>of the Soul,</hi> the flesh, the world and the Divel: <hi>Now to prevent the imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any such efficacious vertue in</hi> the chrisme, <hi>and to shew that by</hi> Baptisme <hi>alone (which is</hi> sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentum militare) <hi>without the addition of</hi> the chrisme, <hi>the person baptized receiveth all that benefite of</hi> grace <hi>and</hi> strength, <hi>whatsoever it be, which he should do, if the</hi> chrisme <hi>were joyned with it (for by</hi> Baptisme <hi>he is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received into</hi> the church <hi>as</hi> a Member of Christ, <hi>but matriculated also into</hi> the Militia <hi>as</hi> a Soldier of Christ) <hi>it might very well be thought convenient, laying aside the annointing with</hi> the chrisme (per modum crucis) <hi>cross<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, that the</hi> Minister <hi>as soon as he hath</hi> bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized the child, <hi>should in express words signifie to the Congregation, that he is now become</hi> the Soldier <hi>of Jesus Christ, as well as</hi> a Member <hi>of his Church, with</hi> the sign of the cross <hi>also used there withall as a</hi> significant ceremony <hi>in token that the person so baptized being now</hi> the Soldier <hi>of Christ, should not be ashamed of his</hi> professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>nor behave himself</hi> cowardly <hi>therein.</hi>

            <head>A SPEECH Delivered in the <hi>CASTLE-CHAMBER at</hi> DUBLIN. 22. of <hi>November, Anno</hi> 1622. At the Censuring of some Officers who refused to take the Oath of Supremacy.</head>
            <byline>By the late Lord <hi>Primate Usher</hi> then Bishop of <hi>Meath.</hi>
            </byline>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hat the danger of the <hi>Law</hi> is for refusing this <hi>Oath</hi> hath been sufficiently opened by my Lords the <hi>Judges,</hi> and the <hi>quality</hi> and <hi>quantity</hi> of that Offence hath been agrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the full, by those that have spoken af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them. The part which is most proper for me to deal in is the information of the <hi>Conscience,</hi> touching the Truth and Equity of the matters contained in the <hi>Oath;</hi> which I also have made choice the rather to insist upon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb facs="tcp:52606:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
both the form of the <hi>Oath</hi> it self requireth herein a full resolution of the <hi>Conscience</hi> (as appeareth by those words in the very beginning thereof; <hi>I do utterly testifie and declare in my Conscience</hi> &amp;c.) And the Persons that stand here to be censured for refusing the same have alledged-nothing in their own defence, but only the simple Plea of <hi>Ignorance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That this point therefore may be cleered, and all need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Scruples removed out of mens minds: <hi>Two</hi> maine <hi>Branches</hi> there be of this <hi>Oath</hi> which require special Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration. The one <hi>Positive,</hi> acknowledging the <hi>Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy</hi> of the Government of these Realms <hi>in all Causes</hi> whatsoever, to rest in the the <hi>Kings</hi> Highness only; the other <hi>Negative,</hi> renouncing all Jurisdictions and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of any Forraigne Prince or Prelate within His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Dominions.</p>
            <p>For the better understanding of the former we are in the <hi>first</hi> place to call unto our remembrance that Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>St. Peter, Submit your selves unto every Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Man for the Lords sake, whether it be unto <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 13, 14.</note> the King, as having the Preheminence, or unto Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors as unto them that are sent by him, for the pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishment of evil doers, and for the praise of them that do well.</hi> By this we are taught to respect the King, not as <hi>the only Gove nor</hi> of his Dominions <hi>Simply</hi> (for we see there be other <hi>Governors</hi> placed under him) but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as him that <hi>excelleth,</hi> and hath the prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence over the rest, that is to say (according to the Tenure of the <hi>Oath)</hi> as him that is the <hi>only Supream Governor</hi> of his Realms. Upon which ground we may safely build this conclusion, that whatsoever Power is inetdent unto the King by vertue of his place, must be acknowledged to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52606:22"/>
be in him <hi>Supream,</hi> there being nothing so contrary to the nature of Soveraignty, as to have another Superior power to over-rule it.</p>
            <q>Qui Rexest, Regem (Maxime) non habeat.</q>
            <p>In the <hi>second</hi> place we are to consider, that God for the better setling of Piety and Honesty among men, and the repressing of Prophaneness and other Vices hath establisted two distinct powers upon earth, the one of the <hi>Keys</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Church, the other of the <hi>Sword</hi> committed to the Civil Magistrate, That of the Keys is ordained to work upon the Inner man, having immediate Relation to the <hi>remitting</hi> or <hi>retaining</hi> of sins. That of the <hi>Sword</hi> is <note place="margin">John 20. 23.</note> appointed to work upon the outward man, yielding Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection to the obedient, and inflicting external punishment upon the Rebellious and Disobedient. By the <hi>former</hi> the spiritual Officers of the Church of Christ are enabled to <hi>govern well,</hi> to <hi>speak,</hi> and <hi>exhort,</hi> and <hi>rebuke</hi> with <note place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 17.
Tit. 2. 15.
Mat. 16. 19. &amp; 18. 18</note> all <hi>authority,</hi> to <hi>loose</hi> such as are penitent, to commit o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers unto the Lords Prison until their amendment, or to bind them over unto the Judgment of the great Day) if they shall persist in their wilfulness and obstinacie. By the <hi>other,</hi> Princes have an imperious power assigned by God unto them, for the defence of such as do well, and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>revenge</hi> and <hi>wrath</hi> upon such as do evil, whether by <hi>death</hi> or <hi>banishment,</hi> or <hi>confiscation of Goods</hi> or <hi>Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. 13. 4:
Ezra 7. 26.</note> according to the quality of the offence.</p>
            <p>When <hi>St. Peter</hi> that had the Keys committed unto him, made bold to draw the <hi>Sword,</hi> he was commanded to put it up, as a weapon that he had no authority to meddle with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; <note place="margin">Math. 20. 52.</note> and on the other side, when <hi>Uzziah</hi> the King would
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52606:23"/>
venture upon the Execution of the Priests office; it was said unto him <hi>It pertaineth not unto thee</hi> Uzziah <hi>to</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2 Chron 26 18</note> 
               <hi>burn incense unto the Lord, but to the Priests the Sons of</hi> Aaron, <hi>that are consecrated to burn Incense.</hi> Let this therefore be our second conclusion, that the Power of the <hi>Sword</hi> and of the <hi>Keys</hi> are two distinct ordinances of God, and that the Prince hath no more authority to enter upon the execution of any part of the Priests function, then the Priest hath to intrude upon an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> part of the office of the Prince.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>third</hi> place we are to observe that the power of the <hi>Civil Sword,</hi> (the <hi>Supreame</hi> managing whereof, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the King alone) is not to be restrained unto <hi>tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> causes only, but is by Gods ordinance to be extended like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise unto <hi>all Spiritual and Ecclesiastical Things and Causes;</hi> That as the Spiritual Rulers of the Church do exercise their kind of Government in bringing men unto obedience, not of the duties of the <hi>first</hi> Table alone, (which concerneth Piety and the Religious Service which man is bound to perform unto his Creator) But also of the <hi>second</hi> (which respecteth moral honesty, and the Offices that man doth owe unto man: So the Civil Magistrate is to use his Authority also in redressing the abuses committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>first</hi> Table, as well as against the <hi>Second,</hi> that is to say as well in punishing of an <hi>Heretick</hi> or an <hi>Idolater</hi> or a <hi>Blasphemer,</hi> as of a <hi>Thief,</hi> or a <hi>Murtherer,</hi> or a <hi>Traytor,</hi> and in providing by all good means, that such as live under his Government may lead a quiet and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able life, in all <hi>Piety and Honesty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And how soever by this means we make both <hi>Prince</hi> and <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Priest</hi> to be in their several places <hi>custodes utriusque Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulae.</hi> Keepers of both Gods Tables, yet do we not hereby any way confound both of their Offices together; for though
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52606:23"/>

               <hi>Civil Government</hi> as this <hi>in Causes Spiritual and Ecclesiasticall</hi> no man of Judgment can deny; For must not <hi>Heresie</hi> (for example) be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be a Cause meerly <hi>Spirituall or Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call?</hi> and yet by what power is an <hi>Heretick</hi> put to death: The Officers of the Church have no authority to take away the life of any man, it must be done therefore <hi>per brachi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um seculare,</hi> and consequently it must be yeelded without contradiction, that the Tempor all Magistrate doth exercise therein a part of his <hi>Civil Government</hi> in punishing a crime that is of its own nature <hi>Spiritual or Ecclesiasticall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But here it will be said, the words of the <hi>Oath</hi> being generall that the King is <hi>the only supreme Governor of this Realm, and of all other his Highness Dominions and Countries.</hi> How may it appear, that the power of the <hi>Civil Sword</hi> is only meant by that Government, and that the power of the <hi>Keys</hi> is not comprebended therein? I answer, <hi>First</hi> that where a Civil Magistrate is affirmed to be <hi>the Governor</hi> of his own Dominions and Countries; by common intendment this must needs be understood of a <hi>Civil-Government,</hi> and may in no reason be extended to that which is meerly of another kind. <hi>Secondly,</hi> I say, That where an Ambiguity is conceived to be in any part of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52606:24"/>
an <hi>Oath,</hi> it ought to be taken according to the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him for whose satisfaction the <hi>Oath</hi> was ministred. Now in the case, it hath been sufficiently declared by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick authority, that no other thing is meant by the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> here mentioned but that of the <hi>Civil Sword</hi> only.</p>
            <p>For in the book of <hi>Articles</hi> agreed upon by the Arch-Bishop and Bishops, and the whole Clergie in the Convocae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion holden at <hi>London<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Anno 1562.</hi> Thus we read. <hi>Where we attribute to the Queens Majesty the Chief Government (by which Titles we understand the minds of some standrous folkes to be offended) we give not to our Princes the Ministring either of Gods word or of the Sacraments (the which thing the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions also lately set forth by</hi> Elizabeth <hi>our Queen, doth most plainly testifie) but that only prerogative which we see to have been given alwayes to all Godly Princes in holy Scriptures by God himself, that is, that they should rule all Estates and degrees committed to their Charge by God, whether they be Ecclesiasticall or Temporall, and restrain with the Civil Sword the stubbornand evill doers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it be here objected, that the Authority of the <hi>Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> is not a sufsicient ground for the Exposition of that which was enacted in <hi>Parliament:</hi> I answer that these <hi>Articles</hi> stand confirmed, not only by the Royall assent of the Prince (for the establishing of whose <hi>Supremacy,</hi> the Oath was framed) but also by a speciall Act of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> which is to be found among the Statutes, in the thirteenth yeer of Queen <hi>Elizabeth, Cap. 12.</hi> Seeing therefore the makers of the Law have full authority to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the Law, and they have sufficiently manifested, that by the <hi>Supream Government</hi> given to the Prince, they
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52606:24"/>
understand that kind of Government only which is exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised <hi>with the Civil Sword:</hi> I conclude that nothing can be more plaine then this, that without all scruple of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the <hi>Kings Majesty</hi> may be acknowledged in this sense to be <hi>the only Supream Governor of all his Highness Dominions and Countrys, as well in all Spiritual or Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Things or Causes, as temporal,</hi> and so have I cleered the <hi>first</hi> main branch of the <hi>Oath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I come now unto the <hi>Second</hi> which is propounded <hi>nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively: That no forreign Prince, Person, Prelate, State or Potentate hath or ought to have any Jurisdiction Power, Superiority, Preheminence or Authority, Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical or Spiritual within this Realm.</hi> The Forrei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that challengeth this <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> or <hi>Spiritual</hi> Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction over us is the <hi>Bishop of Rome:</hi> And the Title whereby he claimeth the Power over us, is the same where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he claimeth it over the whole world, because he is <hi>St. Peters</hi> Successor for sooth. And indeed if <hi>St. Peter</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self had been now alive, I should freely confess that he ought to have spiritual Authority, and Superiority within this Kingdom, But so would I say also if <hi>St. Andrew, St. Bartholomew, St. Thomas,</hi> or any of the other <hi>Apostles</hi> had been alive, for I know that their Commission was very large, to <hi>go into all the world, and to preach the Gospel unto every Creature.</hi> So that in what part of the <note place="margin">Mark 16. 15.</note> world soever they lived, they could not be said to be out of their charge, their <hi>Apostleship</hi> being a kind of an <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal Bishoprick.</hi> If therefore the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> can prove himself to be one of this Rank, the Oath must be amended; and we must acknowledge that he hath Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Authority within this Realm.</p>
            <p>True it is that our Lawyers in their yearly Books, by the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52606:25"/>
name of the <hi>Apostle</hi> do usually designe the <hi>Pope.</hi> But if they had examined his Title to that <hi>Apostleship,</hi> as they would try an Ordinary mans Title to a Piece of Land, they might easily have found a number of Flaws and main de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects therein; for first it would be enquired, whether the <hi>Apostleship</hi> was not ordained by our Saviour Christ, as a special Commission, which being <hi>personal</hi> only was to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine with the death of the first <hi>Apostles.</hi> For howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver at their first entry into the Execution of this Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, <note place="margin">Acts 1. 25, 26.</note> we find that <hi>Matthias</hi> was admitted to the <hi>Apostle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> in the Roome of <hi>Judas;</hi> yet afterwards when <hi>James</hi> the Brother of <hi>John</hi> was slain by <hi>Herod,</hi> we do not read that any other was substituted in his place. Nay we know that the Apostles generally left no Successors in this kind: Neither did any of the Bishops (he of <hi>Rome</hi> only excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) that sate in those famous Churches wherein the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi> exercised their Ministry, challenge an <hi>Apostleship</hi> or an <hi>Universal Bishoprick</hi> by vertue of that succession.</p>
            <p>It would <hi>Secondly</hi> therefore be enquired what sound e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence they can produce, to shew that <hi>one</hi> of the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny was to hold the <hi>Apostleship,</hi> as it were in <hi>Fee,</hi> for him and his Successors for ever, and that the other <hi>Eleven</hi> should hold the same for <hi>Term of life</hi> only. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> if this State of perpetuity was to be cast upon one, how came it to fall upon St. <hi>Peter,</hi> rather then upon St. <hi>John,</hi> who outlived all the rest of his Fellows, and so as a <hi>Surviving Feoffee,</hi> had the fairest Right to retain the same in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and his Successors for ever; <hi>Fourthly</hi> if that State were wholy setled upon St. <hi>Peter,</hi> seeing the Romanists themselves acknowledge, that he was Bishop of <hi>Antioch</hi> before he was Bishop of <hi>Rome;</hi> We require them to shew, why so great an Inheritance as this, should descend unto
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52606:25"/>
the <hi>younger</hi> Brother (as it were by <hi>Borough-English)</hi> rather than to the <hi>Elder</hi> (according to the ordinary manner of descents) especially seeing <hi>Rome</hi> hath little else to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge for this preferment, but only that <hi>St. Peter</hi> was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifyed in it, which was a slender reason to move the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle so to respect it. Seeing therefore the grounds of this great claime of the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> appear to be so vain and frivolous, I may safely conclude that he <hi>ought to have no Ecclesiastical or Spiritual Authority within this Realme,</hi> which is the principal point contained in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part of the <hi>Oath.</hi>

The lamentable effects of our last Wars in this Kingdom, doth yet freshly stick in our Memories. Neither can we so soon forget the depopulation
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52606:27"/>
of our land, when besides the Combustions of War, the extremity of <hi>Famine</hi> grew so great, that the very <hi>wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> in some places by the way side, have surprised the men that rode by to feed themselves with <hi>the flesh of the horse or the rider;</hi> and that now again here is a storm towards wheresoever it will light, every wise man will easily foresee, which if we be not carefull to meet with in time, our State may prove irrecoverable, when it will be too late to think of. <hi>Had I wift.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The dangers that now threaten us are partly from abroad, and partly from home; <hi>Abroad,</hi> we are now at odds with two of the most Potent Princes in Christendom, and to <hi>both</hi> which, in former times the discontented persons in this Country have had recourse, proffering the Kingdom it self unto them, if they would undertake the conquest of it. For it is not unknown unto them that look into the search of those things, that in the days of King <hi>Henry the Eighth,</hi> the <hi>Earl of Desmond</hi> made such an offer of this Kingdom to the <hi>French King,</hi> (the instrument where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of yet remain's upon record in the Court at <hi>Paris)</hi> and the <hi>Bishop of Rome</hi> afterwards transferred the Title of all our Kingdoms unto <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, which by new Grants was confirmed unto his Son <hi>Phillip,</hi> in the time of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> with a resolution to settle this Crown upon the <hi>Spanish Infanta;</hi> which Donations of the <hi>Popes,</hi> howsoever in themselves, they are of no value, yet will they serve for a fair colour to a potent Pretender, who is able to supply by the Power of the Sword whatsoever therein may be thought defective. Hereunto may we adde that of late in <hi>Spain,</hi> at the very same time when the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Match was in hand. there was a Book published, with great approbation there, by one of this Countrey Birth
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52606:27"/>
               <hi>Phillip O Sullevan,</hi> wherein the <hi>Spaniard</hi> is taught, that the ready way to establish his Monarchy (for that is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing he mainly aimeth at, and is plainly there confessed) is first to set upon <hi>Ireland,</hi> which being quikcly obtain'd, the Conquest of <hi>Scotland</hi> first, of <hi>England</hi> next, then of the <hi>Low-Countreys,</hi> is foretold with great facility will follow after.</p>
            <p>Neither have we more cause in this Regard to be afraid of a <hi>Forreign</hi> Invasion, than to be jealous of a <hi>Domest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick</hi> Rebellion, where lest I be mistaken, as your <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships</hi> have been lately, I must of necessity put a difference betwixt the Inhabitants of this Nation; some of them are descended of the Race of the antient <hi>English,</hi> or otherwise hold their Estates from the Crown, and have possessions of their own to stick unto, who easily may be trusted against a <hi>Forreign Invader,</hi> although they differ from the State in matter of Religion; for proof of which fidelity in this kind, I need go no further than the late Wars in the time of the Earl of <hi>Tyrone</hi> wherein they were assaulted with as powerfull temptations to move them from their Loyalty as possibly hereafter can be presented unto them for at that time, not only the King of <hi>Spain</hi> did confederate himself with the Rebels, and landed his forces here for their assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, but the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> also with his <hi>Breves</hi> and <hi>Bulls,</hi> solicited our Nobility and Gentry to revolt from their obedience to the Queen; Declaring that the <hi>English</hi> did fight against the <hi>Catholick Religion,</hi> and ought to be oppugned as much as the <hi>Turks,</hi> imparting the same Favours to such as should set upon them, that he doth unto such as fight against the <hi>Turk,</hi> and finally promising unto them that <hi>the God of peace would tread down their enemys under their feet speedily;</hi> and yet for all the <hi>Popes</hi>

in <hi>88. That his Sword knew no difference between a Catholique and a Heretique, but that he came to make way for his Master;</hi> and what kindness you may look for from the Countrey-men that joyn with them, you may judge as well by the carriage which they ordinarily use towards you and yours, both in the <hi>Court,</hi> and in the <hi>Colledges</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, as by the advice not long since presented by them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Councel of <hi>Spain,</hi> wherein they would not have so much as the <hi>Irish</hi> Priests and Jesuites that are descended of <hi>English blood</hi> to be trusted, but would have you and all yours to be accounted enemys to the designs of <hi>Spain.</hi> In the Declaration publisht about the beginning of the Insur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of <hi>James Fitz-Morice</hi> in the <hi>South,</hi> the Rebels professed it was no part of their meaning to subvert, <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norabile Anglorum solium.</hi> Their Quarrel was only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Person of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and her Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but now the case is otherwise, the translating of the Throne of the <hi>English</hi> to the power of a Forreigner, is the thing that mainly is intended, and the re-establishing of the <hi>Irish</hi> in their antient possessions, which by the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of our Ancestors were gained from them.</p>
            <p>This you may assure your self, <hi>Manet alta mente repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stum,</hi> and makes you more to be hated of them than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the <hi>English</hi> Nation whatsoever. The danger there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being thus common to us all, it stands us upon to joyn our best helps for the avoiding of it, only the <hi>manner</hi> how this may be effected is in question. It was wont to be said, <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquum petas ut aequum feras,</hi> and such perhaps might be the intent of the Project, the other day propounded unto you; but now I observe the distaste you have conceived a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst that, hath so far possossed you, that you can hardly be drawn to listen to any equal motion. The <hi>Exceptions</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52606:29"/>
against the Project, are partly <hi>general,</hi> made by all; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>special</hi> that toucheth only some particulars, of the <hi>former</hi> there are two, the <hi>quantity</hi> of the sum demanded, and the <hi>indefiniteness of the time,</hi> which is unlimited; for the proportion required for the maintenance of Five thousand Foot and Five hundred horse you alledge to be so great, and your means so small, that in undertaking that which you are no ways able to perform, you should but delude His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, and disappoint the Army of their expected pay. And although the sum required were far less, and for a time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be borne by you, yet are you fearful that the payment being continued for some number of years, may afterwards be continued, as a constant revenue to His <hi>Majesties Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer</hi> with which perpetual burden you are unwilling to charge your Posterity.</p>
            <p>The Exceptions of the <hi>second</hi> kind are taken against the grants annexed unto the former demands, the granting whereof seemed rather to hinder then further the Service, as not so agreeing with the Rules of <hi>Equity;</hi> for <hi>first</hi> some have the full benefits of the grants, and have their charge little augmented, as the Countrys which pay com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position Rents, which by those grants during the time of the New payments are suspended. <hi>Secondly,</hi> others that have the charge of the payment imposed upon them to the full, are not Partakers at all of the benefit of the grants, as the <hi>Brittish</hi> planted in the six escheated Countys of <hi>Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</hi> Thirdly such as are most forward to further His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Service, and to contribute with the Most, are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in Conscience for yielding thereto upon the Terms proposed, especially for that Condition whereby the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the Statute against Recusants is offered to be forborne.</p>

returned, &amp; for which I had a letter of very great thanks.</p>
               <p>Now as soon as the <hi>Primate</hi> came to <hi>Dublin</hi> the <hi>Earl of Strafford,</hi> (then Lord Deputy of <hi>Ireland)</hi> desired him to declare his Judgment <hi>publiquely</hi> concerning those Commotions, which he forthwith did at <hi>Christ-Church Dublin,</hi> before the State in two Sermons, to all mens satisfactions, from this Text <hi>Eccles.</hi> 7. 2. <hi>I councel thee to keep the Kings commandement, and that because of the Oath of God.</hi> After this, the <hi>Lord Deputy</hi> (besides his own desire) signified unto him that it would be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to his late <hi>Majesty</hi> (of ever blessed memory) that he should either <hi>print</hi> his <hi>Sermons,</hi> or write a <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise</hi> of the like Subject, the latter of which he made choice of: And having with much labour and industry finisht it, and caused it to be fairly transcribed, he came over with it into <hi>England</hi> with an intention to commit it to the Presse, as hath been declared by the learned and <hi>Reverend Father</hi> in God, the Lord <hi>Bishop of Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln</hi> in his <hi>Preface</hi> to that Treatise.</p>
               <p>To which give me leave to add: That his Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was alwayes the same and so declared by him upon all occasions, since I had the happynesse to be known to him: As <hi>annually</hi> upon the <hi>Kings</hi> Inaugura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion day (which was constantly observed by him at <hi>Drogheda</hi> with great Solemnity:) <hi>and occasionly</hi> in some learned Sermons preacht by him at the opening of two <hi>Parliaments.</hi> And especially upon the first so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity for his present Majesties <hi>Birth day, anno</hi> 1630. at <hi>Dublin,</hi> being sent for of purpose by the State then to preach, which he did upon this Text, <hi>Psalm</hi> 45. 26. <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of thy Fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest make Princes in all the Earth.</hi>

difficulty) through my hands unto him.</p>
               <p>And as his <hi>Prayers</hi> (whtch were all the Arms he had) <note place="margin">His Prayers, joy, and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row according to the success of his Majesties affairs.</note> were daily lifted up (like <hi>Moses</hi> hands) for the prosperity of his Majesties affairs, notwithstanding the hazzard he ran by it, like that of <hi>Daniels;</hi> by a prohibition to the contrary: So was his joy or sorrow perpetually shown according to the success of them.

                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1649.

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:52606:47"/>
Loyalty, which by his Order <hi>four</hi> times a year (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Canon) was preached unto them. And with many <hi>Tears</hi> he lamented the retarding of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties affairs, by the loss of so many faithfull Servants of his, slain there in that <hi>Massacre</hi> in cool bloud.</p>
               <p>In one thing more, the Demonstration of his loyall affection to his Majesty was manifested by his passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate <hi>Commiseration</hi> of those of the distressed sequestred Clergy, who had suffered for him, and by his appearing to his utmost for them (which was more commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, then by hiding himself, to have take no more care, but to preserve one.</p>
               <p>When that <hi>merciless</hi> Proclamation issued forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <note place="margin">His compassio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate affection to such as had suffered for his Majesty.</note> such that they might not so much as <hi>teach a School</hi> for their livelyhood; when my soliciting for them (by his encouragement) <hi>representing</hi> their petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and petitioning for them is my own <hi>name</hi> subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, only to have had them capable of a <hi>Contribution,</hi> throughout <hi>England</hi> (for which as Feoffees in Trust, <hi>Doctor Bromrigg</hi> then the learned Bishop of <hi>Exeter</hi> and my self, were nominated) could not prevail, and an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legant <hi>Apologie</hi> for them written by <hi>Doctor Gauden</hi> the now Reverend Bishop of <hi>Exeter,</hi> which I delivered with my own hand, proved also ineffectuall. Then this eminent <hi>Primat</hi> out of a compassionate sense of their miseries was perswaded by me to make a Tryall how farr his own <hi>personal</hi> presence might prevail in their behalf, and so (much against his own <hi>Genius</hi> and with great regret within himself to go into <hi>Whitehall,</hi> he having no other occasion in the world besides) he went, and I wated on him thither for that end, where he spake at <hi>freely</hi> and <hi>fully,</hi> as some impertinent inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions

                  <hi>of Synodical Government &amp;c.</hi> presented to his late Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Blessed Memory, <hi>Anno</hi> 1641. It is to be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, how it was occasioned by the present Tempestuous <hi>Violence</hi> of the Times, as an <hi>accommodation</hi> by way of Prevention of a totall Shipwrack threatned by the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries <note place="margin">The occasion and end oft it.</note> of it, as appears sufficiently by the Title be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, <hi>viz. Proposed in the year</hi> 1641. <hi>as an expedient for the prevention of those troubles which afterwards did arise in matter of Church Government, &amp;c.</hi> Now what can this, in the sense of any <hi>prudent unbiassed</hi> person prejudice him in his Judgment or Affection to <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy</hi> it self, which rather confirms it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Marchant</hi> parts with that in a <hi>Storme,</hi> that he would not have done in a <hi>Calme,</hi> and at shore recruits himself with the like goods again. St. <hi>Paul</hi> in that <hi>Wracke, Acts</hi> 27. consented not only to the <hi>lightning of the Ship of the lading, but of the Tackling also, We cast them out</hi> (saith he, or St. <hi>Luke) with our own hands,</hi> and all for the saving (if it were possible) of the Ship, and the Passengers in it. That of the same <hi>Apostle</hi> in another case, <hi>I think it fit for the present necessity,</hi> might in some measure in this particular be the <hi>Primates</hi> Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, wherein he was not <hi>singular</hi> neither.</p>
               <p>Unto which I can add this further confirmation, that for those <hi>many years</hi> I had the happines to be known unto him in those serene times, before these troubles arose, to the disturbance of <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> I never heard him mentioning any thing by way of alteration that
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:52606:48"/>
way in those <hi>Proposals</hi> there specified, so that the sole occasion and end of them must be as afore-said.</p>
               <p>And for these 4. Propositions, they were only <hi>present prudentiall</hi> representations, left to the Judgment and correction of <hi>others,</hi> without any Magisterial Impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them, as a <hi>Copy</hi> to be writ after, and as they were not published till an <hi>imperfect</hi> Copy invited unto it, so the real intent of it was by that Conjunction of both parties in <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> Government to have the easier way prepared to their <hi>union</hi> in the <hi>civil,</hi> even an <hi>unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous</hi> endeavour for his <hi>Majesties</hi> happy Restauration (now through Gods great goodness wonderfully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished) for which, as none prayed more zealous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, so none could have exceeded the <hi>Primates</hi> in the joy for it, had he lived to see it.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>form of words</hi> used by the <hi>Bishop</hi> in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> he did much approve <note place="margin">Ordination of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>A gross error it is to think that <hi>Regal Power</hi> ought to serve for the good of the <hi>body,</hi> and not of the <hi>soul;</hi> for mens temporal peace, and not their eternal safety; as if God had ordained <hi>Kings</hi> for no other end and purpose, but only to fat up men like hogs, and to see that they have their <hi>Mast?</hi> Indeed to lead men unto salvation by the hand of secret, invisible, and ghostly regiment, or by the external administration of things belonging unto Priestly order (such as the Word and Sacraments are) this is denied unto <hi>Christian Kings:</hi> no cause in the world to think them uncapable of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme authority in the outward government, which disposeth the affairs of Religion, so farre forth as the same are disposable by humane authority, and to think them uncapable thereof only for that, the said religion is everlastingly beneficiall to them that faithfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in it.

               <p>Besides in as much as their Law did also dispose even of all kind of civill affairs, their <hi>Clergy</hi> being the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretors of the whole Law, sustained not only the same labour which <hi>Divines</hi> doe amongst us, but even the burthen of our <hi>Lawyers</hi> too: Nevertheless be it grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that more things do now require to be publickly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberated and resolved upon with exacter judgment in matters divine, then Kings for the most part have; their personal inhability to judge in such sort as professors do, letteth not but that their Regal authority may have the self same degree or sway which <hi>the Kings of Israel</hi> had in the affairs of their Religion, to rule and command according to the manner of supreme Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors.</p>
               <p>As for the sword wherewith <hi>God</hi> armed his <hi>Church</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ad.</hi> 3.</note> of old, if that were a reasonable cause why <hi>Kings</hi> might then have <hi>Dominion,</hi> I see not but that it ministreth still as forcible an argument for the lawfulness and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of their continuance therein now. As we di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade and excommunicate, even so did the Church of the Jews, both separate offendors from the Temple, and depose the <hi>Clergie</hi> also from their rooms when cause required. The other sword of corporall punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not by <hi>Christs</hi> own appointment in the hand of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:52606:57"/>
the <hi>Church of Christ,</hi> as <hi>God</hi> did place it himself in the hands of the <hi>Jewish Church:</hi> For why? he knew that they whom he sent abroad to gather a people unto him only by perswasive means were to build up his Church even within the bosome of <hi>Kingdomes,</hi> the chiefest Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors whereof would be open enemies unto it, every where for the space of many years: Wherefore such Commission for discipline he gave them as they might any where exercise in a quiet and peaceable manner, the Subjects of no Common-wealth being touched in goods or person by virtue of that spirituall regiment whereunto <hi>Christian</hi> Religion embraced did make them subject.</p>
               <p>Now when afterwards it came to pass that whole Kingdomes were made <hi>Christian,</hi> I demand whither that authority served before for the furtherance of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, may not as effectually serve to the maintenance of <hi>Christian</hi> Religion? <hi>Christian</hi> Religion hath the sword of spiritual Discipline. But doth that suffice? The <hi>Jewish</hi> which had it also, did nevertheless stand in need to be ayded with the power of the Civil sword. The help whereof, although when <hi>Christian</hi> Religion cannot have it, must without it sustain it self as far as the other which it hath will serve, notwithstanding where both may be had: what forbiddeth the <hi>Church</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the benefit of both? Will any man deny that the <hi>Church</hi> doth need the rod of corporall punishment to keep her children in obedience withall? Such a Law as <hi>Macabeus</hi> made amongst the <hi>Scots,</hi> that he which continued an excommunicate two years together, and reconciled not himself to the <hi>Church,</hi> should forfeit all his goods and possessions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:52606:57"/>
Again, the custom which many <hi>Christian Churches</hi> have to fly to the Civil Magistrate for coertion of those that will not otherwise be reformed, these things are proof sufficient, that even in <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> the power wherewith <hi>Eeclesiastical</hi> persons were indued at the first, unable to do of it self so much as when secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar power doth strengthen it, and that not by way of Ministry or Service, but of predominancie, such as the <hi>Kings of Israel</hi> in their time exercised over the <hi>Church of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea but the <hi>Church of God</hi> was then restrained more narrowly to one people and one <hi>king;</hi> which now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing spread throughout all Kingdoms, it would be a cause of great dissimilitude in the exercise of Christian Religion, if every King should be over the Affairs of the <hi>Church,</hi> where he reigneth Supream Ruler.</p>
               <p>Dissimilitude in great things, is such a thing which draweth great inconvenience after it, a thing which <hi>Christian Religion</hi> must always carefully prevent. And the way to prevent it is not, as some do imagine, the yielding up of Supream Power over all <hi>Churches</hi> into one only Pastors hands, but the framing of their government, especially for matter of substance, every wher according to one only Law, to stand in no less force then the Law of Nations doth to be received in all Kingdoms; all So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne Rulers to be sworn no otherwise unto it, then some are to maintain the Liberties, Laws, and received Customs of the Country where they reign: This shall cause uniformity even under several Dominions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out those woful inconveniencies whereunto the State of <hi>Christendom</hi> was subject heretofore, through the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny and Oppression of that one universal <hi>Nimrod,</hi> who alone did all.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:52606:58"/>
And till the <hi>christian</hi> world be driven to enter into the peaceable and true consultation about some such kind of general Law concerning those things of weight and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wherein now we differ; If one <hi>church</hi> hath not the same order which another hath, let every Church keep as near as may be the order it should have, and commend the just defence thereof unto God, even as <hi>Judah</hi> did when it differed in the exercise of Religion from that form which <hi>Israel</hi> followed.</p>
               <p>Concerning therefore the matter whereof we have hitherto spoken, let it stand for our final conclusion, that in a free <hi>christian</hi> State or Kingdom, where one and the self same people are the <hi>church</hi> and the <hi>common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, God</hi> through <hi>christ</hi> directing that people, to see it for good and weighty considerations expedient, that their Soveraign Lord and Governor in causes Civil, have also in <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Affairs a Supream Power; Forasmuch as the Light of reason doth lead them unto it, and against it, Gods own revealed law, hath nothing; surely they do not in submitting themselves thereunto, any other then that which a wise and religious people ought to do; it was but a little over-flowing of wit in <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> so to play upon the words of <hi>Moses</hi> in the old, and of <hi>Peter</hi> in the new <hi>Testament;</hi> as though <note place="margin">Exod. 19.</note> because the one did term the <hi>Jews</hi> a Priestly Kingdom, <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.</note> the other us a <hi>Kingly Priesthood:</hi> Those two Substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives <hi>Kingdom</hi> and <hi>Priesthood,</hi> should import that <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daisme</hi>

               <p>And therefore publick affairs are divided, each kind, in all well ordered States, allotted unto such kind of persons, as reason presumeth fittest to handle them.

The case is not like when such Assemblies are gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together by supreme authority concerning other <note place="margin">This is in the common co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies.</note> affairs of the <hi>Church,</hi> and when they meet about the making <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> Lawes or Statutes.

Laws may be requisite to be made either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning things that are only to be known and believed in, or else touching that which is to be done by the <hi>Church</hi> of God.

But as a man liveth joyned with others in common society, and belongeth unto the outward politique body of the <hi>Church,</hi> albeit the said Law of Nature and of Scripture, have in this respect also made manifest the things that are of greatest necessity, nevertheless by reason of new occasions still arising, which the <hi>Church,</hi> having care of souls must take order for, as need requireth; hereby it cometh to pass, that there is, and ever will be so great use even of humane Laws and Ordinances deducted by way of discourse, as conclusions from the former di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and natural serving for principles thereunto. No man doubteth but that for matters of action and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:52606:60"/>
in the affairs of God, for manner in divine service, for order in Ecclesiastical proceedings about the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Church,</hi> there may be oftentimes cause ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry urgent to have Laws made: but the reason is not so plain, wherefore humane Laws should appoint men what to believe.</p>
               <p>Wherefore in this we must note two things: <hi>First,</hi> that in matter of opinion, the Law doth not make that to be truth which before was not, as in matters of action it causeth that to be duty which was not before; but it manifesteth only and giveth men notice of that to be truth, the contrary whereunto they ought not before to have believed. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that as opinions doe cleave to the understanding, and are in heart asserted unto, it is not in the power of any humane Law to command them, because to prescribe what men shall think, belongeth only unto God <hi>corde creditur ore fit confessio,</hi> saith the Apostle: As opinions are either fit or inconvenient to be professed, so mans Law hath to determine of them. It may for publick unities sake require mens professed assent, or prohibit their contradiction to speciall articles, wherein as there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily hath bin controversie what is true, so the same were like to continue still, not without grievous detriment unto a number of souls, except Law to remedy that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil should set down a certainty, which no man after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards is to gain-say.</p>
               <p>Wherefore as in regard of divine Lawes, which the <hi>Church</hi> receiveth from God, we may unto every man apply those words of wisdom in <hi>Solomon, Conserva fili</hi>

And that this power should belong to the whole, not to any certain part of a politique body, though happily some one part may have greater sway in that action then the rest. Which thing being gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally fit and expedient in the making of all Lawes, we see no cause why to think otherwise in lawes concerning the service of God, which in all well-ordered States and Common-wealthes is the first thing that Law hath care to provide for: When we speak of the right which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally <note place="margin">* <gap reason="foreign">

A shift vain and needless for as much as if we speak properly, we cannot say <hi>Kings</hi> do make, but that they only do place <hi>Bishops,</hi> for in a <hi>Bishop</hi> there are these three things to be considered; The power whereby he is distinguished from other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors; The special portion of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple over whom he is to exercise that Bishoplie Power; and the place of his Seat or Throne, together with the Profits, Preheminencies, Honors thereunto belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

Bishops at this day with us, and that which was usual in former ages riseth from the ground of that right which the <hi>Kings</hi> of this Land do claim in furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the places where Bishops elected &amp; consecrated are to reside as Bishops: for considering the huge charges which the ancient famous Princes of this Land have been at, as well in erecting Episcopal Seas, as also in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowing them with ample possessions, sure of their religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous magnificence and bounty, we cannot think but to have been most deservedly honored, with those Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all prerogatives, taking the benefit which groweth out of them in their vacancy, and of advancing alone unto such dignities what persons they judge most fit for the same. A thing over and besides, even therefore the more seasonable, for that as the <hi>King</hi> most just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath preheminence to make Lords Temporal, which are not such by right of birth, so the like pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence of bestowing where pleaseth him the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Spiritual Nobility also cannot seem hard, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops being Peers of the Realm, and by law it self so reckoned.</p>
               <p>Now whether we grant so much unto <hi>Kings</hi> in this respect, or in the fomer consideration, whereupon the Lawes have annexed it unto the Crown it must of necessity being granted both make void whatsoever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest the people aforetime hath had towards the choice of their own Bishop, and also restrain the very act of Canonical election usually made by the Dean and Chapter, as with us in such sort it doth, that they neither can proceed unto any election till <note n="*" place="margin">25 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3.</note>

This Treatise I mention for that it shortly comprehendeth not only the fore-alledged right of the Emperour of <hi>Rome,</hi> acknowledged by six several <hi>Popes,</hi> even with bitter execration against whomsoever of their succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors that should by word or deed at any time goe about to infringe the same, but also further these other spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cialties appertaining thereunto: <hi>First,</hi> that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops likewise of <hi>Spain, England, Scotland, Hungary</hi> had by ancient institution alwaies been invested by their <hi>Kings</hi> without opposition or disturbance. <hi>Secend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:52606:64"/>
that such was their royal interest partly for that they were founders of Bishopricks, partly because they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook the defence of them against all ravenous op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions and wrongs, part in as much that it was not safe, that rooms of so great power and consequence in their estate, should without their appointment be held by any under them. And therfore that ev'n Bishops then did homage, and took their oathes of fealty unto the <hi>Kings</hi> which invested them. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> that what so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnitity or Ceremony <hi>Kings</hi> do use in this action it skilleth not; as namely whether they doe it by word or by precept, set down in writing or by delivery of a staffe and a ring, or by any other means whatsoever on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that use and Custome would, to avoid all offence, be kept. Some base Canonists there are which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that neither <hi>Kings</hi> nor <hi>Emperours</hi> had ever any right hereunto saving only by the <hi>Popes</hi> either grant or toleration. Whereupon nor to spend any further la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour we leave their folly to be controlled by men of more ingenuity &amp; judgment even amongst themselves: <hi>Duarensis, Papon, Choppinus, Aegidius, Magister, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulphus, Ruzaeus, Costvius, Philippus Probus,</hi> and the rest, by whom the right of <hi>Christian Kings and Princes</hi> herein is maintained to be such as the <hi>Bishops</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> cannot lawfully either withdraw, or abridge or hinder. But of this thing there is with us no question although with them there be; the Laws and customes of the Realm approving such regalities in case no reason there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of did appear, yet are they hereby aboundantly war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted unto us, except some Law of God or nature to the contrary could be shewed.</p>
               <p>How much more when they have been every where

thought so reasonable, that <hi>Christian Kings</hi> through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the world use and exercise, if not altogether: yet surely with very little odds the same; so far that <hi>Gregorie</hi> the tenth forbidding such regalities to be newly begun, where they were not in former times, if <note place="margin">* <hi>Cap.

                  <hi>God</hi> to continue void, not to preserve the <hi>Church</hi> patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, as good to each Successor as any Predecessor enjoy the same, had been in them a most odious &amp; grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous fault.

We see it hereby a thing necessary to put a difference as well between that ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary jurisdiction which belongeth to the Clergy alone, and that Commissionary wherein others are for just considerations appointed to joyn with them, as also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween both these <hi>Jurisdictions</hi> and a third, whereby the King hath a transcendent Authority, and that in all causes over both. Why this may not lawfully be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto him, there is no reason. A time there was when <hi>Kings</hi> were not capable of any such power, as namely
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:52606:66"/>
when they professed themselves open Adversaries unto <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>christianity.</hi> A time there followed when they being capable, took sometimes more, sometimes less to themselves, as seem'd best in their own eyes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause no certainty touching their right was as yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined.</p>
               <p>The Bishops who alone were before accustomed to have the ordering of such Affairs, saw very just cause of grief when the highest, favoring Heresie, withstood by the strength of Soveraign Authority, religious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings; whereupon they oftentimes against this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resistable Power, pleaded that use and custom which had been to the contrary; namely, that the Affairs of the <hi>church</hi> should be dealt in by the <hi>clergy</hi> and by no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, unto which purpose the sentences that then were uttered in defence of unabolishing Orders and Laws, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst such as did of their own heads contrary thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, are now altogether impertinently brought in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition against them who use but that power which Laws have given them, unless men can show that there is in those Laws some manifest Iniquity or Injustice.

For in as much as there was at the first no certain law determining what force the principal Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates Authority should be of, how far it should reach, and what order it should observe, but <hi>Christian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors</hi> from time to time did what themselves thought
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:52606:67"/>
most reasonable, in those Affairs, by this mean it com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth to pass, that they in their practice varie, and are not uniforme.</p>
               <p>Vertuous Emperors, such as <hi>Constantine</hi> the great was, made conscience to swerve unnecessarily from the customes which had been used in the <hi>Church,</hi> even when it lived under Infidels. <hi>Constantine</hi> of reverence to Bishops, and their spiritual authority, rather abstained from that which himself might lawfully do, then was willing to claim a power not fit or decent for him to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise. The order which had been before he ratifieth, exhorting Bishops to look to the <hi>Church,</hi> and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing that he would do the office of a Bishop over the Common-wealth. Which very <hi>Constantine</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing did not thereby so renounce all authority in judging of spirituall causes, but that sometimes he took, <note place="margin">* <hi>Epist.</hi> 68.</note> as St. <hi>Augustine</hi> witnesseth, even personall cognition of them. Howbeit whether as purposing to give there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in judicially any sentence, I stand in doubt; for if the other, of whom St. <hi>Augustine</hi> elsewhere speaketh, did in such sort judge, surely there was cause why he should excuse it as a thing not ususally done. Otherwise there is no let but that any such great person may hear those causes to and fro debated, and deliver in the end his own opinion of them, declaring on which side him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self doth judge that the truth is. But this kind of sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence bindeth no side to stand thereunto: it is a sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of private perswasion, and not of solemn juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, albeit a King or an Emperour pronounce it.</p>
               <p>Again on the contrary part, when Governors infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with Heresie were possessed of the highest power they thought they might use it, as pleased themselves
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:52606:68"/>
to further by all means therewith that opinion which they desired should prevail. They not respecting at all what was meet, presumed to command and judge all men in all causes without either care of orderly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding or regard to such laws &amp; customs as the <hi>Church</hi> had been wont to observe. So that the one sort fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to doe even that which they might, and that which the other ought not they boldly presumed upon: the one sort modestly excused themselves when they scace needed, the other though doing that which was inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable bare it out with main power, not enduring to be told by any man how far they roved beyond their bounds. So great odds between them whom before we mentioned, and such as the younger <hi>Valentinian,</hi> by whom St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> being commanded to yeild up one of the <hi>Churches</hi> under him unto the <hi>Arrians,</hi> whereas they which were sent on his message, alledged that the Emperour did but use his own right for as much as all things were in his own power, the answer which the holy Bishop gave them was, that the <hi>Church</hi> is the House of God, and that those things which be Gods are not to be yielded up and disposed of at the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors will and pleasure; his pallaces he might grant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whomsoever. A cause why many times Emperours did more by their absolute authority then could very well stand with reason, was the over-great importunity of wicked <hi>Hereticks,</hi> who being enemies to peace and quietness cannot otherwise then by violent means be supported. In this respect therefore we must needs think the state of our own <hi>Church</hi> much better settled then theirs was, because our Laws have with farr more certainty prescribed bounds unto each kind of power.
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:52606:68"/>
All decisions of things doubtfull, and corrections of things amiss are proceeded in by order of Law, what person soever he be unto whom the administration of judgement belongeth: It is neither permitted unto Prelate nor Prince to judge and determin at their own discretion, but Law hath prescribed what both shall do. What power the King hath, he hath it by Law, the bounds and limits of it are known. The entire com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity giveth general order by Law how all things publickly are to be done, and the King as the head thereof the highest in authority over all, causeth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the same Law every particular to be framed and ordered thereby. The whole body politick ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth Lawes, which Lawes give power unto the King, and the King having bound himself to use according unto Law that power, it so falleth out that the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the one is accomplished by the other in most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious and peaceable sort. There is no cause given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any to make supplication as <hi>Hilary</hi> did, that <hi>Civil Covernors</hi> to whom Common-wealth matters only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, may not presume to take upon them the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Ecclesiastical causes.</p>
               <p>If the cause be spiritual, secular <hi>Courts</hi> doe not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with it, we need not excuse our selves with <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose,</hi> but boldly and lawfully we may refuse to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer before any Civill Judge in a matter which is not Civill; so that we doe not mistake the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture either of the cause or of the <hi>Court,</hi> as we ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily may doe both, without some better direction then can be had by the rules of this new-found <hi>Disciplines</hi> But of this most ceertain we are that our

is thought on nothing to depend more then upon these two speciall affections <hi>Feare</hi> and <hi>Love: Feare</hi> in the highest Governour himself, and <hi>Love</hi> in the Subjects that live under Him. The Subjects love for the most part continueth as long as the righteousness of Kings doth last, in whom vertue decaieth not as long as they feare to do that which may alienate the loving hearts of their Subjects from them. Feare to do evill groweth from the harm which evill doers are to suffer. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore private men which know the danger they are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto, being malefactors, do notwithstanding so boldly adventure upon heinous crimes, Only because they know it is possible for some Transgressor some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to escape the danger of law. In the Mighty upon earth (which are not alwaies so Virtuous and Holy that their own good minds will bridle them) what may we look for considering the frailty of mens nature, if the world do once hold it for a <hi>Maxime</hi> that Kings ought to live in no subjection, that how grievous disorder soever they fall into, none may have coercive power over them.

               <p>First, as there could be in naturall bodies no motion of any thing unlesse there were some which moved all things and continueth unmoveable, even so in politick Societies, there must be some unpunishable or else no man shall suffer punishment, For sith punishments pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed alwaies from Superiors to whom the administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of justice belongeth, which administration must have necessarily a fountain that deriveth it to all others, and receiveth not from any, because otherwise the Course of Justice should go infinitely in a Circle every Superiour having his Superior without end; which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be; therefore a well-spring, it followeth there is, and a supreme head of Justice whereunto all are subject, but it self in subjection to none.

We say also that many <hi>Primates</hi> now, as so many <hi>Eleazars</hi> under Christ, and in several Kingdoms and States of the world, to govern, direct, and teach <hi>Ecclesiastical persons,</hi> and people in their several divisions; and yet be under and responsible to <hi>Christian Princes</hi> and States, who have the chief charge of matters both Civil and Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> If it be further alledged, that <hi>Eleazar</hi> and all <hi>Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing</hi> Priests <hi>(quatenus</hi> Sacrificers) were Types of Christ, who sacrificed himself for us, and put an end to all Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices typing himself.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ. Answ. This we grant, and further</hi> say, that the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish sacrificing <hi>Priests, Office and other performance</hi> in this regard, is utterly unlawful and sinful. But the other Imployments of <hi>Eleazar, viz.</hi> His <hi>Governing, Directing</hi>
                     <pb n="115" facs="tcp:52606:80" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and <hi>teaching</hi> both the Ecclesiastical persons and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, were not <hi>typical</hi> nor <hi>ended,</hi> but are still of use, for the <hi>Apostles</hi> practiced the same; so have their <hi>Successors</hi> to these very days. And that this is most true, the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterial Classes</hi> cannot but grant; for this very <hi>Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty over Ministers</hi> and people, they use, and therefore judg it not <hi>Typical.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Besides St. <hi>Paul</hi> appearing before one, but a weak resemblance of the old High Priest, yielded him <hi>obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> and acknowledged him a Governor of the people, which had been meerly <hi>unlawful,</hi> if there had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in him something not Tipical, and not made to <hi>cease</hi> by Christ.</p>
                  <p>Hence we see the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> shifts to be vain and gross, when they say we ought to have no <hi>Wars,</hi> for the <hi>Jews</hi> wars were but Figures of our <hi>spiritual battle; No Magistrates,</hi> for the Jews Magistrates were but Figures of our Pastors, Doctors and Deacons; and as no Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates, so no <hi>Oaths,</hi> pretending these to be abolished by Christ. <hi>Answ.</hi> As in the <hi>Priests</hi> Office there were some things <hi>not</hi> Typical, not ended: So Kings, <hi>Types of Christ,</hi> in somthing only prefigured, and Typed him. In many things their Office is still of singular use, for they become <hi>Nursing Fathers of the Church</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide that we may live a <hi>peaceable life in all Godliness and Honesty.</hi> The lawfull use of Wars and Oaths hath been often vindicated.</p>
                  <p>If the <hi>Pope</hi> here claim authority over all the <hi>world,</hi> as <hi>Eleazar</hi> over all his brethren, his Plea is <hi>groundless, wicked and insolent.</hi> For, first, each chief Bishop in any Kingdom, must be subject to the King, as <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Eleazar</hi> to <hi>Moses.</hi> 2. The <hi>Apostles</hi> sent into several
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:52606:81"/>
Kingdoms of the World were all of <hi>equal</hi> power, no one had Authority <hi>above</hi> the rest in their line, or division, which shews that no <hi>Primate</hi> ought to be of Authority over any <hi>other</hi> Primate under a several Prince. But each <hi>Primate</hi> subject to <hi>Christ</hi> as <hi>Eleazar</hi> to <hi>Aaron,</hi> and each <hi>Primate</hi> subject to his several King. As <hi>Eleazar</hi> to <hi>Moses.</hi>

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:52606:92"/>
not one of them was appointed to preach the word of God. They were but ignorant blockheads, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing still in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eart and effection Papists, and enemies to the Gospel. Now such as were sincerely affected to the Gospel, prevailed so far as that they obtained Ministers, with whom the Priests could not agree: they retained their Service, and the Ministers preached, and had the exercise of Religion asunder, following the order of the Churches of <hi>France.</hi> In those beginings at the pursuit of Mr. <hi>John After,</hi> Dean, I was sent by my Lords of the Councell to the Islands, as well in regard of the School that was newly erected, as to be a Minister there.</p>
            <p>At that time the Bishop of <hi>Constance</hi> was sent Amba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadour from the French King to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> from whom, and from her Councell he obtained, Letters to the Governors of the Islands, whereby they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to yeild unto him all authority and right, which he pretended did belong unto him, as being the true Bishop of the Islands. But how this blow as was warded let your Fathers tell you. Upon this occasion the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Winchester</hi> (as their true <hi>Bishop)</hi> took upon him the protection of the Churches of both Islands, representing to the <hi>Queen,</hi> and unto her Councel, that of old the Islands did belong to his Bishoprick, and that he had ancient Records for it; yea an Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication from the <hi>Pope</hi> against the Bishop of <hi>Constance,</hi> whenever he would challenge any Episcopall Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction over the Islands. So through the means of the said Bishop, and Mr. <hi>John After,</hi> Dean, two places on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were priviledged of my Lords of the Councell, St. <hi>Peeter-haven</hi> for <hi>Garnzay,</hi> and St. <hi>Helier</hi> for <hi>Jarnsay,</hi> with prohibition to innovate in ought in the other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes.
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:52606:92"/>
Then were the Court and Chapter of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop held, which afterwards were supprest, how, by whom, and by what authority, I know not: I fear the Authors have run themselves into <hi>Premunires</hi> (if <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munires</hi> have power within the Islands) The Consisto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Classes and Synods of Ministers have succeeded them, yet without any Episcopall Jurisdiction. Now so it is, that your Islands want Episcopall Courts for prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Wills, for Divorces, and Marriages, and for the Tythes which are causes, and Actions, Ecclesiasticall, and have so been these 600. years and upwards, as well under the Dukes of <hi>Normandy,</hi> as the Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> The Reformation and change of Religion hath altered nothing; neither is there any one that hath pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or authority to transferre the said causes to any other Judges then to the <hi>Bishop,</hi> but the <hi>Kings</hi> Majesty: so that your Civil Magistrates have nothing to doe with such causes; if they meddle with them 'tis usurpation. The <hi>French</hi> Ministers are so rash as to say, that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of <hi>England</hi> have usurpt this Jurisdiction, and that it belongeth not unto them, because it is Civil, making no difference between what some <hi>Bishops</hi> have heretofore usurpt, &amp; what the <hi>King</hi> and Soveragn Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates have freely given (for certain reasons moving them thereunto) and conferred upon <hi>Bishops;</hi> therefore though the matter be civill, yet can they not be held for usurpers. Truly the present state and condition of the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> doth bely such slanderers of our Bishops. I fear that your Magistrates being sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned with this Doctrine, have carried themselves in this point more licentiously then the Laws of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and of their Islands will warrant them. I pass o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:52606:93"/>
the debates that might be made upon this matter, as a thing impertinent in the place and government under which we live. I consider the state of <hi>England.</hi> and that of the Islands, and the dignity of Bishops, and the condition of the other Ministers of the Church, such as it is at this day. In <hi>Scotland</hi> for the time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the State hath otherwise provided, but not in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and therefore ye ought not to take example by them, as though your State were like theirs. I hear that your Governor hath taken order about Wills, and appointed one to prove them. But I cannot conceive how that may be done without Episcopal Jurisdiction conferred by the Bishop. Your Governour I know hath power to present to the Bishop a man proper to execute this authority of the Bishop in his name. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the Governor as Patron of the Churches and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes of his Government, upon the vacancy of any li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, ought to present by such a time a man well qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified to succeed in the Office of a Pastour, but the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission and induction of such a charge, belongs to your Bishop, and to no body else. If I be well informed, you observe nothing of all this: which if it be so, you'l never be able to justifie it. The example of the <hi>French</hi> Churches, and of the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> doe you no good. Your case is quite another: They have Laws from their Soveraigns, and particular places for themselves, but all that you doe is contrary to the Laws and Ordinance of the King your Soveraign. You hold Synodicall meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, wherein you make Statutes about the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, unto which you bind your selves and the rest that are naturall Subjects to the King: wherein you (unsensibly derogate from his authority.
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:52606:93"/>
The Synods of the Arch-bishops and Bishops, together with the rest of the Clergy of this Realm dare not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume that which you doe, nor attribute to their Canons and Statutes what you attribute to yours. Yet the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly of Bishops and of their Clergie, is of men far o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise qualified then some dozen of the Ministers of your Islands to judge and discern what belongs to the edification of the Church; their Decrees nevertheless are of no authority to tye unto them those of this Realm, till the <hi>King,</hi> yea in his own person, have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved them, and by Proclamation made them his: There is no body in his Realm, nor in any of his Dominions that hath power to enact Laws and Decrees but himself: The <hi>Parliaments</hi> authority is great, but without the Kings assent nothing takes the rigour of Law. I know very vell, that at the perswasion of the Ministers, your Governours and others that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to your Synods, have subscribed and acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your Synodicall Acts, they did it even in my time: but their power doth not stretch so far. That may bring a greater prejudice to themselves, then give force of Ecclesiasticall Law to your Decrees. I doe not think that his Majesty being well informed will grant unto your Ministers or Governours of your Islands such authority: They will be more pernicious to you then youthink. You'l alledge me, I know, your Priviledges; but I dare boldly answer you; that you never had any such priviledges: I have read them, and have the copies of them; and they say; that in matters Civil you shall be governed by the ancient <hi>Coustumier</hi> of <hi>Normandy,</hi> and that you are not subject to the Statutes of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament in such matters, nor to the Subsidies, other
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:52606:94"/>
charges and impositions that are raised in <hi>England,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept (which God forbid ever should come to pass) the King were detained Prisoner by the Enemy. In mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Ecclesiasticall you are freed from the Bishop of <hi>Constance,</hi> and under that of <hi>Winchester,</hi> yea even of old by the <hi>Popes</hi> authority and consent of the two Kings, from whom also in part, your neutrality in times of warre is approved, excommunicating all such as would molest you. Ye cannot shew concerning your priviledges, but only what is renewed as often as there is a new King. And for the Patent which you say you have procured from his Majesty for matters of Religion; <hi>First,</hi> it is in generall terms, and without any clause derogating from the authority of your <hi>Bishops. Secondly,</hi> if it be questioned, it may be told you, that it was surreptitious, and granted you before the King was well informed of the business. To conclude you must understand that in matters of Religion the Kings Majesty will doe nothing without the counsell and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the <hi>Arch-bishop</hi> and your Bishop of <hi>Winchester;</hi> wherefore you may doe well to insinuate your selves in their favour, and conform your selves to them, as we have done in the beginning. You may reduce the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the use of the book of prayers to a good and Christian Discipline, farre more solid, and better grounded then that for which ye so earnestly bestirre your selves.</p>
            <p>I must addone word more which will be hard of dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion. This is it, that you may be upbraided, that as many Ministers that are naturall of the Countrey, being not made Ministers of the Church by your Bishop, nor by his Demissories, nor by any other according to the order
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:52606:94"/>
of the <hi>English</hi> Church, you are not true and lawfull Ministers. Likewise that as many among you as have not taken institution and induction into your Parishes from the Bishop, nor from his Substitute lawfully or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained and authorised so to doe, ye are come in by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusion and usurpation of cure of Souls, which no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy could give you but your Bishop, that is, in terms and words Evangelicall, that you are not come into the <hi>Sheep-fold by the door,</hi> but by elsewhere, and that by the Ecclesiasiastical Laws you are excommunicants and Schismaticks. I know well enough you do not regard such Laws, and think that your Priviledges will exempt you from them, wherein you greatly deceive your selves. For a man may tell you, who are yee that would have your Ecclesiastical Decrees made by Private Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, to have force of Laws, and dare scorn and reject those of the English Church, made by Publick Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, by farre honester men, greater Scholars (without comparison) more learned, and farre more in number then you are? The Kings Majesty by his Royall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority hath approved <hi>them,</hi> this Realm hath received <hi>them.</hi> But what are your Synodall Decrees? who be the Authors of them, and who be they that have approved them? 'Tis winkt at, and your ignorance is born with, but think not, that that which is born in you be any such thing as vertue. Your Priviledges do not stretch so far as that you may make Ecclesiasticall Decrees: Had it been so, the Priests had retained Mass and Poperie: In that you hold a contrary course to that of the English Church whereof you are and must be (if you be Englishmen) Members, it proceeds from nothing else but from the connivence and indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:52606:95"/>
of your Governors, who have given too much credit to the French Ministers, and partly in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, to the stubborness of the Papists of the Islands. When your Governors shall have a liking to the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Reformation, then will they make you leave the <hi>French</hi> Reformation: You fail against wind and tyde; you think that the Governors you shall have hereafter will be like Sir <hi>Tho. Layton,</hi> you are deceived. Though this day you had compassed your wish, to morrow or the next day after, at your Governors pleasure, all shall be marred again.</p>
            <p>Finally, the Ecclesiasticall Government which you aske, hath no ground at all upon Gods word. 'Tis altogether unknown to the Fathers, who in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Christian Discipline, and censure of manners, were more zealous and precise then we are, But you cannot, of all the learned and pious antiquity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> shew one example of the Discipline or Ecclesiasticall order, which you hold, as your <hi>Bishop</hi> in his book of the <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall government of the Sonne of Gods Church,</hi> doth learnedly teach. I pass over what I have my self writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten concerning it in my book, <hi>De diversis Ministrorum gradibus,</hi> and in my Defence against the Answer of Mr. <hi>Beza,</hi> and more largely in my Confutation of his book <hi>De triplicigenere Episcoporum.</hi> I cannot wonder enough at the <hi>Scotchmen,</hi> who could be perswaded to abolish and reject the state of Bishops, by reasons so ill grounded, partly false, partly of no moment at all, and altogether unworthy a man of such fame. If the Scots had not more sought after the temporal means of Bishops, then after true Reformation, never had Mr. <hi>Beza's</hi> Book perswaded them to do what they
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:52606:95"/>
have done. And I assure you, that your opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the government of the Church, seems plausible unto great men, but for two reasons, the one is to <hi>prey</hi> upon the goods of the Church, the other for to keep it under, the Revenues and authority of Bishops being once taken away. For the form of your discipline is such, that it will never be approved of by a wise and discreet supreme Magistrate, who knows how to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern. Ye see not the faults you commit in your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings as well Consistoriall as Synodals, men well ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the Lawes, and in government do observe them. But they contemn them so long as they have the law in their own hands, and that it is far easier for them to fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate them, &amp; regard neither Consistorie nor Synodes, then for you to command and make Decrees. Were your Discipline armed with power, as the Inquisition of <hi>Spain</hi> is, it would surpass it in tyranny. The Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall authority is Canonical, that is, so limitted and enclosed within the bounds of the <hi>Statutes</hi> and <hi>Canons</hi> [of the Church] that it can command nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Law, much less contrary to Law. And the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop is but the Keeper of the Lawes, to cause them to be observed, and to punish the transgressors of your Consistories and Synodes. For the present I will say no more, only take notice of this, that it is not likely the King who knows what Consistories and Synodes be, will grant that to the Islands which doth displease him in <hi>Scotland.</hi> This, Gentlemen and Brethren, have I thought good to write vnto you, intreating you to take it well, as comming from him that loves the Islands, and the good and edification of the Church of Christ, as much as you can doe.</p>

               <p>And what is here <hi>subscribed</hi> as to the book of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-prayer,</hi> was heretofore (to my own knowledge) as diligently <hi>attended</hi> by persons of the like eminency being so farre from absenting themselves, that they were carefull to come to the beginning of it. And it is also as fully defended by Mr. <hi>Hildersham</hi> in his 26. Lecture upon <hi>cap.</hi> 24. of St. <hi>John)</hi> (a man of as much learning and piety as any before mentioned) to be <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods institution, Ordinance and Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> which in another Treatise I have more largely declared (with the testimonies of divers others.) And in his 27. and 29. Lect. exhorts unto <hi>kneeling</hi> at it, and being <hi>bareheaded</hi> even at the <hi>reading of the Psalms and Chapters,</hi> as of the rest of Divine Service, defends the custome of our Church therein, <hi>as well becomming eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of Gods people to conform themselves unto it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the view of the <hi>Registry</hi> of Subscriptions of later years, I find that till the year 1641. all subscribed as abovesaid, and continued it, to the <hi>Articles of Religion,</hi> though with several expressions and provisoes,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In an.</hi> 1643. thus, <hi>Tertio Articulo praescripto, &amp;c.</hi> or thus, <hi>Articulis Religionis praescriptis juxta formam statuti in eodem Casu editi, &amp; provisi, i. e.</hi> To the Articles of Religion before written, according to the form of a Statute (or Ordinance) in that case provided and published.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:52606:98"/>
In 1644. the form was thus, <hi>Articulis Religionis Ecclesiae Anglicanae juxta formam Statuti in ea parte editi, &amp;c.</hi> quatenus non regugnant foederi Nationali, <hi>&amp;c. i. e.</hi> To the Articles of Religion of the Church of <hi>England, &amp;c. as far as they are not repugnant to the</hi> National Covenant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And about 1646. thus: <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vo foedere Nationali,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then about <hi>Octob.</hi> 1648. that clause was left out (there being it seems in the <hi>Covenant</hi> somewhat contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting that horrid Act intended unto the late <hi>King</hi> of <hi>blessed Memory)</hi> and the form was then only <hi>Artioulis Religionis Ecclesiae Anglicanae,</hi> and so continued till this late happy change of Government, when the subscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions returned to the first form.</p>

               <p>One thing more in relation to the <hi>Lord Primate Ush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> There hath been a Pamphlet of late revived which had been printed before in his name, intituled <hi>The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Armaghs Direction to the Parliament concerning the Liturgy and Episcopal Government, &amp;c.</hi> against which, as himself had declared in his <hi>life</hi> time, so have I since his <hi>death,</hi> to be a false fictitious Paper; yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding it is reprinted, and sold up and down as his, and accordingly produced at this day, by many upon all occasions to his great injury.</p>
