            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A short Account of the Death of Pope <hi>ALEXANDER</hi> the <hi>VII.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving out of some <hi>Italian</hi> Papers under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to draw a Succinct Account of the last Sickness and Death of the late Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the Seventh, I was afraid that the work would seem but maimed and imperfect, if I should not insert some Passages relating to his first Rise and Advancement to the Papal Dignity. I have therefore given this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Hint to that effect, for satisfaction of such as being unacquainted with his History, desire to have some knowledge of his Beginning, before I come to speak of his Latter end, which is the principal Scope of this short Narrative.</p>
            <p>Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the Seventh was Native of the City of <hi>Sienna</hi> in <hi>Tuscany,</hi> and descended of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Family of <hi>Ghisi,</hi> who in his younger years, grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eminent for his great parts and Learning, was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted at his riper age to the Bishoprick of <hi>Imola</hi> in the Territories of the Church, and therein behaved himself with so much Prudence and Policy, giving manifest Proofs, upon all occasions, of his great Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity for publique Employments, that he was made Vice-Legat of <hi>Ferara;</hi> then Inquisitor of <hi>Malta;</hi> and afterwards sent <hi>Nuncio</hi> to <hi>Cullen</hi> and <hi>Munster,</hi> at the Treaty held there for a General Peace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:58206:4"/>
And having undergone all these Offices, and in them acquired much honour and reputation, he received as a reward of his great merits, a Cardinal's Cap, in the Year 1652, in the Month of <hi>February,</hi> from Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the Tenth, and was admitted into the number of the <hi>Purpurati:</hi> After which, as a greater Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Pope's favour to him, he was constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Secretary of State, and in that Employment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued till the Death of the said Pope, and his own Election to the Papacy, unto which he the rather at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, as was supposed, to cross the Designs of the Faction of the <hi>Barbarini.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At his first Creation, that he might gain the hearts of the Common-people, he used all means to express his Charity to the Poor, amongst whom he distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted great Sums of money; the like he did for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance of Prisoners, and for beautifying and buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding many Churches, and other publique Structures, not only in <hi>Rome,</hi> but also in several places in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state of the Church; wherein he exhausted most part of his treasure, and politickly refused all Presents, which were made him by such as intended thereby to insinuate themselves into his favour; as in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, three rich Coaches, with six Horses apiece, from the Cardinal <hi>de Medici,</hi> the Cardinal <hi>Arach,</hi> and the Prince <hi>de Pamphilio.</hi> And amongst the rest, a Damask Bed embroidered with Gold, from that grand She Statist <note n="*" place="margin">See her Life Printed at <hi>London.</hi> 1667.</note> 
               <hi>Donna Olympia,</hi> the Bosom Favourite of his Predecessor <hi>Innocent</hi> the X.</p>
            <p>He filled all the vacant and most considerable Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces (so soon as he was established in his Throne) with very eminent and deserving Persons; and amongst
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58206:4"/>
others, he conferred on the present Pope, <hi>Clement</hi> the Ninth, the Place of Secretary of State. To be brief, during his whole reign, which was almost Thirteen years, he gave evident testimony of his Zeal for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of the Interest of the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great moderation and indifferency toward the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Factions, always shunning as much as he could, the adhereing to any one of them, in prejudice of another.</p>
            <p>But that I may not go beyond the limits of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended brevity, which was only to give you this small Account, for the better understanding of what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, and that I might not be thought abruptly to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the subsequent Discourse of his last Sickness and Death; I do therefore now wave further particulars of his Life, and proceed to the intended Relation.</p>
            <p>The Pope being seized with his old Distemper in the beginning of the last <hi>Lent,</hi> and fore-seeing the Danger which threatned him, without expecting any other advice of his Physicians, was willing to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare himself for the great passage which he fore-saw, that in a short time he was to make, from this Life to another; and intending in thefirst place to dissintangle himself from all external business, that he might be able, with less distraction, to apply himself to the internal Concernments of his Soul; on the 13 day of <hi>March,</hi> of this present Year 1667 <hi>new style,</hi> he called a Consistory, whether, being apparelled in the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed habit he went in Person, although much cast down by his Infirmity, yet recollecting all the Spirits and Vigor which were left him, he constrained himself to perform that great Function. Wherein he
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58206:5"/>
promoted to the Cardinalship eight of those select persons, whom he supposed, for their great worth and labours, bestowed for the good of the Papal See, had merited the advancement to so high Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>But his Disease increasing, four days after, he was Assaulted by a grievous fit, from which he conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that his Sickness was mortal, and notwithstanding, it grew more and more violent daily, yet for all this, he had thoughts of performing the long Ceremonies of <hi>Holy Thursday,</hi> to prepare himself for Death, as he said, by meditating on the sacred Mysteries of the Passion of Jesus Christ, and would have executed his intentions in despight of his pains, if his Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and Chyrurgeons, together with his Confessor had not perswaded him to the contrary; remonstrating to him the Inconveniencies which might arise, from the hard Labours which are inseparable from such prolixe Ceremonies. And although he was perswaded by them all that time, yet was he resolved with that little strength he had left him (though much broken and extenuated by his Disease) on <hi>Easter-day</hi> upon the Gallery of <hi>Monte Cavallo,</hi> where this Function is used to be performed, with a solemn Benediction in <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificalibus,</hi> to bless the People, which there flocked in exceeding great multitudes, being driven there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto not only out of Devotion, but also by a desire of seeing their Pastour yet whole and alive. He bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them, having raised himself up twice according to the Custom, without the help of the Pontifical Seat; and this was the last time that he saw his flock, or they him.</p>

But it was not Gods will that he should long enjoy this apparent prosperity, for three days after he was assaulted by mortal pains, and such ones, that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer in comparison of these seemed but light Flea-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings; which that he might gain vigour to resist with Patience, he ordained the most <hi>Holy Saerament</hi> to be exposed in all the principal Churches of <hi>Rome.</hi> But the Disease growing desperate, and he being assured by the Physicians that he was to dye, he received the tidings of Death, not only with a total resignation to God, as he said, but also with rejoycing and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, as a message of eternal felicity, which he hoped to enjoy: then called for the Viaticum, which after his confession he received with great Devotion. After this he caused all the Sacred College of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinalls to be called to him; and though he was by the sharpness of his Disease brought very low and almost reduced to extremity, yet he addressed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with a steady voyce to them, in a most excellent and Eligant Exhortation in the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue, which he said, he purposely chose, because he could better express his conceptions in that than in the <hi>Italian.</hi> In this amongst other things he put them in remembrance of his Election, and their compelling him to accept that high Dignity, which was far from his thoughts, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he affirmed that they had made him Sacrafise the Sweetness of his Rest, to their resolutions: he begged their pardon for his frailty, which he might, through his passion, have committed, makes an Appology for expending great sums for promoting the Church In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest. Intreats them to use the sincerity and cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the next Election, which was shortly to be, as
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58206:6"/>
they had done in his. Exhortes them against Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness, wherein he useth this expression, Consider that from the Church you have received the most honourable part of what you possess; that if you were constrained to leave that which you received from the Church, to the offerings of others, how much more contentedly, (without any other appetite) should you then enjoy that which you do now possess, &amp;c? Lastly, he recommends to their care and protection, his Cardinal Nephew, his Aged Brother, and the rest of his Kindred, and himself to their prayers. This being spoken, he lifted up his hands and Blessed them, and then their Eminencies having made some reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions uppon his discourse, approached to the Bed side with tears in their Eyes, and after they had taken pains to comfort him, with great tenderness they Kissed his hand, and departed.</p>
            <p>At last, they being all departed, and only his familiar Friends and Ghostly Fathers continuing in the room with him, he altogether applyed himself to his Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, often repeating these words, <hi>Cupio disolvi &amp; esse cum Christo.</hi> And those which assisted him he caused continually to read Spiritual Books, &amp; divers Prayers, and Psalms, especially the Penetential Psalms, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now, if his Disease was long and painful in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est degree, his Patience was then very admirable, and incredible, which he shewed in his suffering of those cruel and most grievous torments, as without doubt, those were which he endured, in regard of the many parts of his body, which after his Death, were discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be offended; yet was he never observed during all his sickness to have a discomposed countenance.</p>

A certain Priest presented him with a Picture, where there were very well drawn some Hearts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind every one of which was represented one of the Misteries of the most holy Passion, and he sent him word, that it was not for any pretence he had, that he presented him with that Picture, but only that at the sight of that, he might call to mind, the torments suffered by <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> and thereby arm himself with Patience, when his pains were most violent. It is impossible to tell how acceptable this gift was to him, which although it was but simple indeed, he required the Doner of it with much Liberality, and caused it to be put behind the Pillow, in that place exactly where he used to lay his Head, when he was most Tormented with pains, and from time to time he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded it to be removed to the feet of the Bed, that he might with the more ease and sitting up behold it.</p>
            <p>After he had received both the Eucharist and the Extreme Unction; he disposed himself for his <hi>Transit,</hi> with a marvellous undantedness: and had already even lost his Speech, when one of his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious men standing by exhorted him to do an act of Contrition, and to aske <hi>God</hi> pardon of his Sins, he collecting his Breath, which was flying away, with a most lanquishing voyce, which could hardly be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, answered <hi>Ita.</hi> The same added that he should hope in the Mercies of God, who is always ready to showre down his Mercies upon a penitent heart; The Pope answered with the same weakness of Speech, <hi>Certe.</hi> Which were the last words which proceeded out of his mouth. Although his Agony had lasted long, and above measure painful, nevertheless the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58206:7"/>
great Pontife did not the shew least sign of Impatience: and when he perceived himself to decay, he said, <hi>Ones Life should decay before ones Death.</hi> He desired to have his Indulgence in <hi>Articulo Mortis,</hi> from the hand and voice of one of the <hi>Religiosi</hi> that assisted him.</p>
            <p>He was often visited by the Cardinals, contrary to the former customs, who were willing to be round about his Bed till his End. And on <hi>Sunday</hi> the 22. of <hi>May,</hi> about 22. of the Clock, he quietly rendred his Spirits to his Creator, in the 60 Year of his Age, and 13 of his Pontificate; and the same Evening, the usual Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony being performed by the Cardinal Lord Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain, the Corps were arrayed in the accustomed Vestments, put into a Litter of Crimson Velvet open on all sides, compassed round about by the Peniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiary Fathers, with lighted Torches in their hands, accompanied by the Guards and Light Horses, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by the Artillery, and with the Rere Guard of Curiassiers, being carried to the <hi>Vatican,</hi> and there the next morning opened, there was found on one part of the Lungs, fastned to one of his sides, a Touch of a black Spot; one of his Kidneys wasted, and some Carnosities or fleshy Kyrnels instead of it, from whence the passage of the Urine was hindred; and an Ulcer of the Reins, which of all his other Diseases was the worst: From thence, being Embalmed and Pontifically Apparelled, he was carried the next day to the Cathedral of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and placed in the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of the most Holy Sacrament, where was a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of an infinite number of people, to kiss his feet, and take from him whatsoever they could lay hands on, to preserve to themselves as Holy Reliques.</p>

            <p>On the two other fronts of the foure Spires there was for each of them another Medal without any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription underneath: Other buildings were painted there, made in the life time, and by order, of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the deceased Pope. The Urn was likewise adorned with the Histories of the glorious actions done by his Holiness the Pope: In the lower front was represented the <hi>Immaculate Conception,</hi> for the which his Holiness some years since had been so much concerned. In another was figured the Coronization of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Villa nova</hi> the <hi>Augustinian.</hi> In the third front was that of St. <hi>Francesca di Sales,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Geneva.</hi> And in the fourth, the Beatification of St. <hi>Peter de Arbues,</hi> the <hi>Aragonian</hi> Martyr. And neer to that were two Pictures of the deceased Pope.</p>
            <p>All the great Medals, Pictures and Impresses were beautifully adorned with gold, with the Compart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments equal and uniform, which gave no little admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to the great concourse of people, who flocked to behold the symetrie of a Fabrick which amidst sadness breathed out so marvellous beauty.</p>

And principally was the wonder of the Beholders increased on Monday morning, and the other two days following (wherein the Lords Cardinals per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the last Funeral offices round this <hi>Mausoleum)</hi> when it appeared lighted by near six hundred Wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, besides a number of great Candles and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; and the splendour of the gold triumphing over the black colour with that of the burning Luminaries, it was not to be discerned whether or no the Lights gave a more pleasing variety to the Gildings, or that the Gildings borrowing from them, made the greatest lustre.</p>
            <p>At this fair and mournful spectacle remained speech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less with admiration, four great silver'd Statues, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting the foure Vertues, <hi>Prudence, Iustice, Fortitude</hi> and <hi>Temperance,</hi> who sate by the sides of the Urn; silent, not only out of admiration, being the Behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of so fair and vast a Mole, but also for sadness, as having lost so dear a cherisher of theirs, that had known so well how to learn happily their Doctrine.</p>
            <p>It was admirable in the morning to see the Lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries burn, with which the whole Machin was ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily fill'd, whilest it flamed round about the four great Spires, by certain windows whereof they were full, and in them did marvellously ascend within-side artificially by certain degrees, which were guided commodiously almost from the extremity of the Obi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisk, the work of the Mole remaining so admirable and undefaced until this present, to the end that each curious Eye may be sufficiently satisfied with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding it.</p>

            <p>In the following Days, when they had with mature consideration, made many Scrutinies and Accesses for divers Subjects, finally after the Supreme Papal Sea had been vacant for the space of Twenty eight days, was the most Eminent Lord Cardinal <hi>Giulio Rospigliosi</hi> created, with sufficient Votes for Supreme Pastor; whoe noble bud and ancient Stock, was produced in the pleasant Garden of one of the famous Cities of our <hi>Great Tuscany.

My Pen is not a fit Pencil in the least to rough-draw the great Jubily with which the hearts of the people of <hi>Rome</hi> were filled, when on <hi>Monday</hi> morning the Twentieth of <hi>Iune</hi> it began to be whispered about the City, that so Deserving a Prelate had been created the Sacred Monarch of Christendome, and every one desiring by manifest Signs to be certified of it, left their own houses, running hither and thither, and like distracted people find no quiet whethersoever they range, all congratulating with their friends their being favoured by heaven with so Holy a Pastor.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the last Scrutiny and Access be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing finished in the Chappel called <hi>Di Sisto,</hi> wherein the Supreme Bishop was created, and the Dore of it set open, there were seen to appear the Illustrious Lord <hi>Sexton,</hi> the Masters of the <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> and the <hi>Secretary;</hi> and after the Schedules were burned, as it is the Custom to do every day, the Lords Cardinals <hi>Francesco Barbarino</hi> as Deacon of the Holy College, and <hi>Arach</hi> as first Priest made the accustomed intreaty to his Eminency the Lord <hi>Giulio Rospigliosi,</hi> that he would accept the Popedome, to the which by agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Votes he had been elected by the Lords Cardinals; and his Eminency having accepted that sublime Charge, chose to himself the Name of <hi>Clement</hi> the Ninth, and it is hoped that the Acts of his Clemency shall not prove, but correspond to his Name.</p>
            <p>The Masters of the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> were called at that Act, and he being then conducted by some of their Eminencies behind the Altar of the said Chappel, was by the Assistance of the Lord <hi>Sexton,</hi> and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> disrobed of his Cardinal

            <p>Being Cloathed in this manner, he was set down in the Pontifical Chair before the Altar of the said Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, where all their Eminencies, the Cardinals, came one by one to worship him on their bended Knees, for the first time, acknowledging him the chief Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor. At which Adoration, first appeared the Lord Cardinal <hi>Barbarino</hi> the Deacon, who (with his knees on the ground) kiss'd his foot and his right hand, and was suddenly caused to rise upon his feet by his Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, who kissed him on either Cheek.</p>
            <p>At this instant was heard to resound with sweet Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choes by the harmonious Voyces of the Musicians of the Chappel the <hi>Ecce Sacerdos magnus,</hi> and amidst this loud reverberation, his Eminency the Lord Cardinal <hi>D'Este,</hi> one of the Masters of the <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> bearing along the <hi>Cross,</hi> accompanying him, was condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to the accustomed Tower of the <hi>Benediction,</hi> over the great Portch of the Church of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and there they had but just opened, when his Eminency, and the said Master of the <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> with the <hi>Cross,</hi> could scarcely croud in; they shewed this most holy Banner to the people, who stayed in the <hi>Piazza</hi> eager to behold it, esteeming it a certain Sign that afterwards by the said Lord Cardinal would be proclaimed those words which cleerly were heard to be pronounced, that is to say, <hi>Annuncio vobis gaudium magnum; habe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Pontificem, Eminentissimum, &amp; Reverendissimum Dominum Cardinalem Iulium, Rospiliosum, qui sibi no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men imposuit Clementem nonum.</hi>

            <p>

Unexpressible was the Content which the people shewed when these words were published; and no less was the Desire of the Nobility, who without the Bridge (which was shut up with Portcullesses) stayed with a multitude of Coaches, wherewith all the neighbouring wayes were crouded: neither was the eagerness of the numerous people inferior, every one expecting with extreme impatience that they should open to them those grates which hindered them from being able to run into the <hi>Piazza</hi> of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> to hear the Election of the Pope published, and to see the other Functions.</p>
            <p>It had already stroke three and twenty of the clock, when after the publication abovesaid was finished, there sounded unexpectedly in every ones ears the thundrings of the loud Artillery, an inanimate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument to rouze up in the hearts of Mortals, Jubily and Mirth; the Shot went alternately from the Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets, Cannons, and Mortar-pieces for half an hours space. The grates were set open, the chains thrown down, the Coaches ran about, the people flew; nothing was heard but Voyces of Acclamation and noises of Mirth, every one desiring to get into the Cathedral of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> where it was hoped that they might behold the new Pastor; all the Bells rang, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was there a corner in <hi>Rome</hi> wherein was not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned an excessive Joy and unexpressible Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in all mens countenances; nor stood the Drums and Trumpets idle, whose hollow Mettals sweetly invited the Squadrons of Soldiers, which ordinarily stayed in the <hi>Piazza</hi> of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> to answer them with a Doubled Salve of Musquet Shot, who betwixt mirth
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:58206:13"/>
and Jubily had already appropriated to themselves the Cardinal Coach, with the Horses of the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Pastor, from whose Coach-man they had also taken away his Cloak, and these are the accustomed Spoils belonging to the said Soldiers.</p>
            <p>In this interim many Masons un-walled the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave, their Eminencies the Cardinals being already brought to the second Adoration in the said Chappel, the most eminent <hi>Barbarino</hi> the Deacon beginning as above, and the other Cardinals following all in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with purple Coats, and this Function being ended the Musicians of the Chappel preceeding, who sang certain Mottets; the <hi>Cross,</hi> and their Eminencies the Lords Cardnials following, his Holiness was carried in a Pontifical Seat into the <hi>Basilica,</hi> where he was by all the sacred College adored the third time: the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Musicians singing at the same instant the <hi>Te Deum Laudamus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> &amp;c. the adoration being finished, and the <hi>Te Deum,</hi> the Lord Cardinal Deacon was conducted to the side of the Epistle, where some Prayers and Verses were said over the new Pope, who was set down upon the Altar, from which when he had descended, the Mitre being first reached to him by one of the Assistant Deacons, and having the <hi>Cross</hi> standing before him, he turned to the people, and gave them his Benediction; and after his Mitre was again put on by one of the Deacons, he ascended with the said most Eminent Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals the Steps of the Altar, and gave his Benediction to the sacred College, on both sides of him where he stood; then being disrobed of his holy Pontifical Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered Mantle, and his Mitre carried to him, he was put in a close Seat, and carried to the Pope's Lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:58206:13"/>
in the <hi>Vatican</hi> Palace, with a great Train of Followers; St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church, and the Portches of it, resounding with the continual Voyces, <hi>Long live Pope Clement the Ninth,</hi> his Holiness imparting his Pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Blessing unto the numerous people, at his ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the Palace. Every one was satisfied to see the Supreme Pastor, who with his Majestical gravity (by which he forced all hearts to reverent veneration, and to prostrate themselves on their Knees) was observed to discover a pleasing affability.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rome</hi> celebrating these Festivals, was seen that same night, and the other two following, all light, by a number of Bonfires in the publique ways, and by many Torches and other Luminaries, at the Windows of Palaces, and particular Houses; and each of these nights, this Castle of St. <hi>Angelo</hi> hath with multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Vollies of Shot rouzed the courage of every one to renew the Joy for the Election of Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the Ninth, registred from Eternity with the Pen of the uncreated Providence, in the Leaves of Immortality, by the Soveraign Mover, who hath granted to us this holy Shepherd, to the end he may rightly guide his Flock, and rescue them from the Teeth of the infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Wolf, with an holy Pattern, and an exemplary Life, that may serve as a Mirrour or Looking-glass to all the World, and a Spur to every one to drive them to the way of perfection, and to enrich them with some of those many Virtues which are marvellously resplendent in his Holiness.</p>

            <head>A true Relation of the Ceremonies perform'd at the Solemn Coronation of his Holiness Pope <hi>CLEMENT</hi> the IX. Dedicated to the Illustrious and Reverend Father <hi>Fr. Giacinto Libelli,</hi> Master of the sacred Apostolical Palace.</head>

            <p>THE Functions of publick demonstrations which are wont to be made, either at the Promotions of Princes, or at other happy successes, deserve not the title of Festival, if the applauses of the People disagree from the inward resentments of their minds; but those wherein the joys of the heart, and acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the tongue are united with excellent harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, are rendered more worthy than others of being by means of the Press transmitted to the knowledge of Posterity. Such was the <hi>Coronation</hi> of <hi>Clement</hi> the IX. lately Cardinal <hi>Rospigliosi;</hi> and for this reason I took the courage to write it, and dedicate it to the name of your most Reverend Fatherhood: I doubt not of its acceptance, because that you sustaining un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Him (with so much praise) one of the most principal Charges of the Pontifical Palace, never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred but on Subjects of eminent merit, cannot reject a labour which is diffused into the Glory of those who fill the precinct of this holy place above any other part of Christendom, it even comes to (point out) <hi>itself,</hi> amongst the very same persons.</p>
            <p>Betimes on Sunday morning the 28. of <hi>June,</hi> were made ready the things necessary for the person of his Holiness, in the Chamber of the Vatican Palace, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of the <hi>Paramenti,</hi> whither the Pope at the appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted hour was carried from his own Lodgings.</p>
            <p>There by the most eminent Cardinals Deacons,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:58206:15"/>
               <hi>Este</hi> and <hi>Rondinino,</hi> and other Ministers designed to that office, he was cloathed with an Amicte, a Surplice, a Girdle, a Stole or long Vesture, a Rochet and a precious Mitre; the sacred College of their Eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies cloathed also in their accustomed Purple Clokes, making a Majestical Crown round about him. In their appointed places stood the other Prelates, every one with his Cope over his Surplice, and the Officers wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their Cloaks.</p>
            <p>The Pope prepared as in the like solemnity is usual, the Procession began towards St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church. The Cross-bearer going first with a Crucifix, between two assistant Ministers; then the other Prelates and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers; and in their places, according to the order of precedency, went their Eminencies, the Cardinals, two by two: His Holiness followed cloathed as above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, under a Canopy of state, carried in a Pontifical Seat by his Stable Grooms wearing long red Gownes, and the Staves of the Canopy of State were carried up by Knights of St. <hi>Peter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The new Pope being arrived at the Portch of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> sate down in a Pontifical Chair, set there on a Throne, raised but little from the Floor, and under a Cloth of State, and then the Lord Cardinal <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rino</hi> (Archpriest of that Cathedral) did beseech his Holiness, that he would admit the most Reverend, the Canons of the Chapter-House, to the kissing of his Foot; when which Function was ended he entred by the middle gate into the Church, carryed as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid, and making his adoration to the most Holy Sacrament, he went towards the <hi>Clementine</hi> Chappel all ready prepared for this purpose, and received the most eminent Cardinals to the kiss of his knee, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:58206:15"/>
the other Prelates to that of his Foot. This Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny finished, and the Mitre being laid aside, the Pope rose up, and standing as the Custome is, blessed the People: And whilst the Sub-Deacon who was to sing the Epistle, cloathed himself in his accustomed Vest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, his Holyness tuned the <hi>Deus in Auditiorium,</hi> &amp;c. of the Prime.</p>
            <p>Whilst the <hi>Prime</hi> was singing by one of the Assistant Lord Bishops, another of the Assistant Lord Bishops stood forward with a Book, wherein the new Pope read the Preparatory to the Mass. By this time, the Apostolical Sub-Deacon had dressed himself in his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed Garments, and the Sandals were taken up by the hand of the Lord <hi>Sexton,</hi> who by the help of one of the Chamberlains put them upon the feet of his Holyness, who at the end of the <hi>Prime,</hi> laying down his Mitre, and standing upon his Feet, sang the Corrent Oration, the most Eminent Cardinal <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rino</hi> the Deacon holding the Book before him. The Prayer ended, and the <hi>Benedicamus,</hi> &amp;c. said by the Singers, the most Eminent Cardinal <hi>Barbarino</hi> retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to his place, and his Holiness was cloathed in his wonted Robes for the solemn celebration of the Mass, and after they were quite dressed, the Procession be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan towards the Altar of the Holy Apostles St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in this order.</p>
            <p>First went the Houshold Servants of his Holyness, and his Chamberlains. Next followed the Barons, the Conservators, and the Orators of Princes, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretaries and Consistorial Advocates, confusedly one amongst another, and without order, but two being the most ancient of each order led in the worthyest place; Then the Assistants, the Clerks of the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:58206:16"/>
the Auditors of the <hi>Rola,</hi> the <hi>Accolito Turifera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio,</hi> with the Candlestick-Bearers, the Sub-Deacon with the Papal-Cross, and with him the other Sub-Deacons; the Sub-Deacons, the one Greek, and the other Latin, each of them with his Book; then the Abbots, the Bishops, and the Archbishops fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed after the Bishops that were Assistant to the Pope, and according to the order of precedency the most eminent Cardinals; betwixt two Assistant Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, who were the Lords Cardinals <hi>Este</hi> and <hi>Rondini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> went his Eminency the Lord Cardinal <hi>Maldachino,</hi> that was to sing the Gospel in the Papal Mass. Lastly, followed the Pope as aforesaid.</p>
            <p>Afterwards between the two priory Chamberlains, came the Lord <hi>Cerri</hi> Deacon of the <hi>Rola,</hi> with the Mitre, and the Prothonotaries and Overseers of the Pope's Court not dressed. Immediately before his Holyness the Seign. <hi>Fulvio Servantio</hi> Master of the Ceremonies, carrying in his hand two Canes, in the top of one of which was a little Flax, and in the other a lighted Candle, and at the Pope's going out of the Chappel of St. <hi>Gregorio,</hi> the Master of the Ceremonies turning, gave fire to the Flax and kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before the Pope, said with a loud Voice, <hi>Sancte Pater, sic transit Gloria Mundi.</hi> And so it was done two other times before he came to the Altar of the Holy Apostles.</p>
            <p>The People being come into the Chancel of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, the last three Cardinal Priests presented themselvs before him, &amp; kissed him on the Breast and Face. Then standing at the Altar, the Mitre being laid aside, and the accustomed Prayers made at the Desk, the Mass began, and immediately after the Confession was
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:58206:16"/>
made, he went mitred into the Throne, and there sate down, and was accosted by the most eminent Cardinal <hi>Antonio Barbarino,</hi> as youngest Deacon, who standing betwixt the other two Bishops sang the first Prayer; and the most eminent Cardinal <hi>Ginetti,</hi> the second Bishop, sang the second; and his Eminency Cardinal <hi>Barbarino</hi> as first Bishop the third, each of whom when he sang, standing between the other two. When these Prayers were ended, his Holyness with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Mitre, went up to the Altar, and his Eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy the first Deacon, by the help of his Eminency <hi>Rondinino</hi> the second Deacon, taking the Mantle from the Altar, put it upon his Holyness, saying the accustomed words at the doing such a Function; coming from the Altar, it being perfumed with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense as the use is, he withdrew to the throne of the <hi>Epistola,</hi> and standing up with his Mitre on was Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the most Eminent Cardinal <hi>Maldachino</hi> the Deacon, without admitting him to kiss his hand, as it was the Custome at other times; but immediately returning to his throne, he received him to his wonted reverence, and the other Prelates.</p>
            <p>After the Prayers were said, the usual Letanies sung, and the Mass ended, so prepared as he was, the Pope went up unto the Throne that was prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon the broad place on the top of the Stairs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the entrance of the Cathedral of St. <hi>Peters,</hi> where sitting down, he gave time to all the People to go out of the Church to see the Act of his Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Then the most eminent Cardinal <hi>Rondinino</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Deacon, took off from his head the Mitre, and his Eminency the first Deacon standing on his right

            <p>At this time was the Artillery of the Castle of St. <hi>Angelo</hi> shot off, the people, with Voyces of mirth and contentment, accompanying the loud noise of the Cannons. The insolent clamours of the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude being some what asswaged, the Indulgencies as the custom is were published.</p>
            <p>The Crowned Pope after he had blessed the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, was carried without a Canopy of State, to the said Dressing Chamber, or <hi>Camera de Paramenti,</hi> where being disrobed, the said Cardinal, Deacon in few words congratulated with him, in the name of all the sacred College.
