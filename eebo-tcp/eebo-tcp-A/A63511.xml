            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

A true Diſcovery of the ground of the Impriſonment of <hi>Francis Ellington, Thomas Cocket,</hi> and <hi>Edward Ferman,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>I <hi>Francis Ellington,</hi> living in <hi>Wellingborough</hi> in the County of <hi>Northampton,</hi> about the 9. day of <hi>October</hi> 1654. being in my Calling and employment at a Faire at <hi>Harborough</hi> in <hi>Leceſterſhire,</hi> and hearing that there was one <hi>Willing Dewsbury</hi> a <hi>Yorkeſhire</hi> man at a friends houſe there; and he was that day to declare the word of the Lord to the Conſciences of the people; and being free in my ſpirit to go to hear him, I went to the friends houſe, and heard him declare the word of life to my Conſcience, which raiſed the witneſs of God in me, that did own what he ſpake to be the Word of the Lord; which my underſtanding did enlighten to ſee the way to eternal life, which I had long ſought in my imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Saints condition. Then was I moved of the Lord to deſire his ſervant, who to me declared His word, when he was free in his ſpirit, to come to my houſe, which he did upon the 27. day of the 10. Month called <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> and a friend with him whoſe name is <hi>Joſeph Storre,</hi> who ſtayed at my houſe that day and night; and on the morrow <hi>Richard Denit</hi> Conſtable of the Town, came to my houſe with a warrant from <hi>Thomas Pentlow</hi> called Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and ſaid, that he came to apprehend one of thoſe two that were at my houſe; I asked him if he had a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, he ſaid he had: I deſired him that he would let me read his warrant: which he did, and I reading it, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no name, in the warrant, of him he ſhould apprehend, but for one he called <hi>Quaker;</hi> I replyed, that I could not ſee how he could apprehend any of thoſe two in my houſe
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:105155:3"/>
by vertue of that Warrant, ſeeing there was not any name in the Warrant, but the Conſtable laid hands on <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Dewsbury,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>that he was the man, and that he ſhould go with him before the Juſtice,</hi> which he did the ſame day, and <hi>Joſeph Stor</hi> was moved to go with him to <hi>Thomas Pentlow's</hi> houſe in <hi>Wilby;</hi> then I being free in my ſpirit, did with other friends go along with them to <hi>Thomas Pentlows</hi> houſe, and there hearing the examination of <hi>William Dewsbury</hi> and <hi>Joſeph Stor,</hi> and after that <hi>Thomas Pentlow</hi> had made their <hi>Mittimus,</hi> and gave the Conſtable charge of them, the ſaid <hi>Thomas Pentlow</hi> came forth of the room into another room whete I and other friends were, and asked me, and one <hi>Richard Smith what we did in his houſe, and who gave us leave to come into his houſe?</hi> and threatned us <hi>to make us anſwer onr affronting him in his houſe at the next Seſſions.</hi> Then I, and <hi>Richard Smith</hi> told him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that we came not to affront him in his houſe, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could he prove it by our carriage ſince we came into his houſe; but the occaſion of our coming thither at that time was to require of him to do us Juſtice. He asked for <hi>whom would you have juſtice againſt?</hi> We replyed for one <hi>Bridget Makernes</hi> of <hi>Findon,</hi> which was at that inſtant in his houſe. He asked us, <hi>what ſhe did to us?</hi> We anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that about two weeks before, the ſaid <hi>Richard Smith</hi> and my ſelf, and another friend with us, went to <hi>Findon,</hi> and the ſaid <hi>Briget Makernes</hi> (as we were peaceably paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing through the ſtreet in <hi>Findon)</hi> did abuſe us in throwing water at us, and ſtones, and dirt, and calling us rogues, witches and Divels; yet we gave her no cauſe, not ſpoke not to her, but left her; and for this abuſe and affront done to us, we come to thy houſe, to deſire juſtice of thee againſt the ſaid <hi>Bridget. Thomas Pentlow</hi> anſwered, <hi>that ſhe had ſerved us right for ought he knew,</hi> and further ſaid, <hi>that hewould not do any thing for us againſt her;</hi> but charged us, <hi>to be forth-coming<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and he <hi>would ſend a Warrant to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable before the Seſſions to bring us to anſwer for the coming into his houſe.</hi> We replyed and ſaid, that he might do his pleaſure, and ſo departed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:105155:3"/>
About three days after, I was moved of the Lord to write theſe following lines, and ſent them privatly ſealed up, to the hands of <hi>Thomas Pentlow.</hi>

Now to the light in thy conſcience which Chriſt Jeſus hath enlightned thee withal, am I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to ſpeak theſe words, that with it thou mayeſt exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and ſee how thou executeſt Juſtice; and how thou didſt execute Juſtice upon thoſe two faithful ſervants of the living God that thou haſt committed to priſon; the Law of God in thy Conſcience ſaith, that he that preacheth the Goſpel hath a lawful Calling, and is no vagabond though he have no out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward habitation, and the Spirit of truth made it manifeſt in the perſon of Chriſt; and he that ſaith he abideth in Chriſt, ought ſo to walk as he himſelf walked: and he that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of the Lord to preach the Goſpel, though he be a Judg<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Juſtice, or whoever, muſt when God Calls him, leave Father and Mother, Wife and Children, and all, and muſt go

your own Conſciences, which convinceth you of ſin, and of evil deeds: and for this the wicked world perſecutes them, to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil the Scriptures; but a body God hath prepared them, and they can ſuffer more then the wicked world can inflict upon them; and when the wicked have puniſhed what they can, they will forgive them and pitty them and when they are bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten they reſiſt not, when they are curſed they bleſs; and thus the ſeed that the Lord hath brought out of the North Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is grown to a thouſand, and ten thouſand in all parts of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland:</hi> and the high Cedars begins to fall apace in <hi>England,</hi> to this mighty power of God; for the Lord is very terriblè be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Northern Army, that the ſcornful world call <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers;</hi> yet not one of theſe Souldiers hath ſo much as a ſtick in their hands; but they have a ſword in their mouths, and with it they ſlay the Nations; therèfore you that are called <hi>Juſtices,</hi> you may put them in priſon, but you cannot take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their Swords; for they can ſlay as well in priſon as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out: and one of them through the power of God, dare encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with a thouſandi, and overcome them; him whom thou haſt caſt into priſon, with his ſword ſlew two mighty men, and their familiès in <hi>Bedfordſhire</hi> this laſt week; and he hath ſlain me, and hundreds more in theſe parts: and now thou haſt ſent him to ſlay ſome in <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hampton</hi> with this ſword in his mouth; and I am ſure the ſlain of the Lord will be many thereabouts: and happy had thou been if he had ſlain thee when he wàs at thy houſe; for thou muſt be ſlain with the ſword, or elſe thou ſhalt nèver ſee thy Saviour; therefore look to the light of Chriſt in thy Conſcience, and with that light bring all thy evil deeds to light, and to the ſword of the Lord, and wait in this: light for the power of Chriſt, to croſs thy will and imagination, and that power will lead thee up to Chriſt, and then thou wilt take up thy croſs to thy will, and untill thou doeſt it thou art no Diſciple of Chriſt, profeſs what thou wilt; for if thou doeſt profeſs more than thou doeſt poſſeſs, thou art an hipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite.
