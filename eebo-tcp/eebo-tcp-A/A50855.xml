            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <bibl>St. LUKE, Chap. 1. Vers. 28.</bibl> And the Angel came in unto Her, and said, Hail, Thou that art highly favour'd, the Lord is with Thee: Blessed art Thou among Women.</q>
            </head>
            <p>
               <hi>GReat is the Mystery of Godliness,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.16.</note> says St. <hi>Paul; God Manifested in the Flesh, Iustified in the Spirit, Seen of Angels, Preached unto the Gentiles, Believed on in the World, Received up into Glory.</hi> Mysterious Doctrines these indeed, and such as transcend the Capacities of Men I do not say,<note place="margin">Wisd. 19.16.</note> (those poor shallow Creatures <hi>who hardly guess aright at things upon Earth, and with la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour find even the things that are before them</hi>;) but also of the Holy Angels of God. Those Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Spirits, who are all Flame and Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, cannot arrive to the Knowledge of them; are not allow'd as much as a Glimpse into these Depths of our Holy Religion. Desire they may and do, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.12.</note> to pry a little into these Gospel-<hi>Arcana</hi>; but can by no means have their Curiosity gratifi'd: Any Wisdom inferiour to that of God, being uncapable of a full Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98024:3"/>
and Understanding of them. The reason is plain: <hi>For what Man,</hi> says the great Apostle, <hi>knows</hi> even <hi>the Things of a Man,</hi> our poor inconsiderable Thoughts and Designs, <hi>save the Spirit of a Man which is in him?</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.11.</note> 
               <hi>Even so the Things, the deep Things of God knows no Man,</hi> (nor for the same reason any Creature else) <hi>but the Spirit of God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vers. 10.</note> And yet God hath <hi>revealed Them unto us,</hi> says the same Apostle. He has so; But how? and in what measure? He has not explained the Modes and Reasons of Gospel-Mysteries surely; Those are, and will, even in Heaven, remain to us Unintelligible: But ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted us meerly with the Truth and Reality of them, and discovered what those Supernatural Doctrines of Faith are, by Extraordinary Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. A Revelation, to go on with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as early as the Prophetic Writings, wherein the Apostle affirms them to be declar'd: <hi>The My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of the Gospel,</hi> says he,<note place="margin">Rom. 16.26.</note> 
               <hi>was</hi> a thing <hi>hid from Ages, and from Generations, kept secret since the World began; but is now, by the Scriptures of the Prophets, made known, and manifested to all Nations, for the Obedience of Faith.</hi> A Truth undoubtedly clear and evident, as far as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the Promises of a <hi>Messiah,</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi>) of our Blessed Saviours Mission into the World, which
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98024:3"/>
are in the old Prophesies most expresly deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: but if extended to the several Doctrines touching his Person, can only be true in this sense, that the <hi>Fulness of Time</hi> was able to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret those Ancient Records so, as to discover in them even these Doctrines too. The Birth, Life, Actions and Sufferings of our <hi>Saviour</hi> spread a sensible Light over those Ancient Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes, and made these Essential Truths of the Gospel appear, otherwise or not at all, or very hardly discernable. The Truth is, there is so much Obscurity in their Manifestations of them, (if I may so speak without absurdity) that 'tis almost as difficult out of the Prophets to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Reality of any such Mysteries, as 'tis impossible to understand the Natures of them. For to instance in that one, which more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly relates to the present Festival, I mean the Mysterious Incarnation of our Lord: This Truth, I confess, was in some sort delivered to our first Parents, in that promise of <hi>bruising, the Serpents Head by the Seed of the Woman:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 3.15.</note> But this was a wonderfull dark Insinuation of the Mystery. I grant also, that <hi>Abraham</hi> had some Knowledge of this Matter; (our Saviour himself attests so much, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8. 56.) So likewise had the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs, and several Godly Men, in the first Ages
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98024:4"/>
of the World. They embrac'd This among many other things of the Gospel; nay, <hi>they saw them,</hi> says the Author to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> Chap. 11. v. 13. but then 'twas <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>a far off,</hi> at a vast distance, and so implies a very Inadequate and small Discovery. The Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> may seem indeed to have had a much clearer and more advantagious view of Christ Incarnate, in his account of it, Ch. 7. v. 14. <hi>Behold, a Virgin shall conceive, and bear a Son, and shall call his Name Immanuel.</hi> For if the Prediction relate to <hi>Christ,</hi> then the Prophet knew that the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our Lord was to be a <hi>Virgin.</hi> But that the <hi>Virgin</hi> there mentioned, was to Typifie the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> and the <hi>Immanuel</hi> to be born, our <hi>blessed Saviour,</hi> we have only the warrant of a <hi>Mystical Interpretation,</hi> made indeed by St. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi> Chap. 1. v. 23. and so most undoubtedly true; but such as otherwise we should never have thought upon; the plain Letter of the Text only pointing out to a Child, to be born immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after the Prophesie, (whoever he was) as a Sign to King <hi>Ahaz,</hi> that <hi>Ierusalem</hi> should be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured from the Arms of the Kings of <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Syria.</hi> So that for all the Prophetical accounts of this and the like Doctrines of Faith, we are like to be left infinitely in the dark, unless
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98024:4"/>
the Divine Goodness unfolds what they wrap'd up in Types, and displays the Truth of them in such an evident manner, as may procure and establish a belief of them in the minds of Men.</p>
            <p>But blessed be God, who will not suffer the World to remain under the Prophetic Shades, and continue ignorant of the Principles of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity any longer. It suffic'd the Wisdom of Heaven to have kept these Glorious Things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known in a manner during the <hi>Mosaic Oeconomy.</hi> But now the <hi>fulness of time</hi> is come, when the <hi>Mysterious Abyss</hi> of the Gospel shall be broken up, and the <hi>Glories of Christianity</hi> appear in so eminent and illustrious a manner, <hi>that all the Ends of the World may see the Salvation of God.</hi> The Grand Design of Heaven is to be laid open, and unravel'd successively, in all the Parts and Branches of it.</p>
            <p>The first of them, and Foundation of all the rest, I mean the <hi>Manifestation of God in the Flesh,</hi> was explain'd to us this very day, by the Message of an Angel; God sent one of those blessed Spirits from Heaven, on purpose to inform us who was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>That Virgin,</hi> (as the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> styl'd her by way of Eminency) that blessed Woman of all the World, who was to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98024:5"/>
be the <hi>Mother</hi> of our Lord. And who was this <hi>Virgin,</hi> think ye, who was to be Christ's Mother? and to whom upon that account, so extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary an Embassy was dispatch'd? Some <hi>great</hi> and and <hi>noble Personage</hi> certainly, highly eminent for her <hi>Extraction</hi> and <hi>Quality.</hi> No such matter, but on the quite contrary, a poor mean Daughter of <hi>Israel</hi>; expressing indeed in her Name something of <hi>Ladiship,</hi> (for so much St. <hi>Ierom</hi> tells us the word <hi>Mary</hi> imports in the <hi>Syriac</hi>) but in reality of very low condition. Lord! how thou despisest those things which in the opinion of the World pass for <hi>great</hi> and <hi>honourable</hi>! how thou delightest to dignifie the most excellent grace of <hi>Humility,</hi> by this and all the other circumstances of thy <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation</hi>! A <hi>lowly Hand-maiden</hi> she was, (as she styles herself in her <hi>Magnificat,</hi> v. 48.) in whom before all the Princesses of the Earth, our bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Lord was pleased to invest himself with <hi>Flesh,</hi> and become an Infant. Of this astonishing <hi>Mystery</hi> the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> gives her solemn no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, v. 31. and out of an admiration of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Honour our Saviour was about to do her, before he delivered his message, he addresses himself to the Holy Virgin in this affectionate Salutation: <hi>Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:98024:5"/>Which words admit a twofold Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: for they may be taken either in a plain <hi>Indicative</hi> sense, and so they expresly denote the transcendent Glories and Priviledges of the blessed Virgin; or else they may bear a sense <hi>Apprecative,</hi> as the Learned <hi>Grotius</hi> and others are of opinion they do, and so they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to be a Salutatory form of speech, wherein the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> most heartily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulates her upon the subject of her wonderful Conception, whereof he is come on purpose to give her an assurance, and wishes her thereupon all the joy and happiness imaginable. And thus the Reverend Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> paraphrases the words in this manner: <hi>Hail, Gracious Person, the Lord of Heaven be with thee; and let all men ever account thee the most blessed woman in the world.</hi> In either acceptation of the words, the Glorious Saint of this day is sufficiently insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be the Grand Favourite of Heaven; such a woman as all the Generations of the Earth should have reason to celebrate, and esteem most happy.</p>
            <p>Let us now meditate upon, and consider ('tis, or ought to be, the religious exercise of this <hi>Festival</hi>) the great and noble Character here given her. Let us first of all fix our
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98024:6"/>
thoughts upon the high Honour God has vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed her. And then, in the second place, in Consideration of that, and of her singular En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments and Graces, pay to her memory all due Veneration and Respect: To the first part of this Religious Duty, we have a prevalent Motive in the first words of the Text; to the latter in the close of the Angels Salutation.</p>

               <note place="margin">Vers. 30.</note> who tells her that she had <hi>found favour with God.</hi> Though I am not ignorant that other Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are fastned upon the word. Our Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Divines, many of them, rendring it <hi>gratis dilecta</hi>; the Romanists generally <hi>gratiosa,</hi> or <hi>gratia plena:</hi> neither of them so much out of respect, as I conceive, to the meaning of the word in this place, as out of a design to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance their own particular <hi>Hypotheses.</hi> Not to stand therefore upon Critical Niceties, certain it is, that highly <hi>grac'd</hi> and <hi>favour'd</hi> she was; in so transcendent a manner, that we cannot fix our Meditations upon the Honour done her, in all its several <hi>ennobling</hi> and <hi>exalting</hi>Circumstances, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being swallow'd up with Admiration. We
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98024:6"/>
cannot trace the Divine Love to Her through the various Mazes and Labyrinths of it, without losing our selves in so profound a Speculation.</p>
            <p>We shall in the following Discourse, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her as <hi>highly favour'd</hi> upon these two ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts:

               <hi>Graces</hi> and <hi>Vertues</hi> wherewith she was, in a very eminent degree, dignified and accomplish'd.

And I know very well there are a sort of ill-natur'd Fanatical Spirits, who will not allow this Holy Woman any Extraordinary Grace, nay indeed not any Civil Respect upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this her Honourable Relation.

An Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion so far true indeed, that her Piety could not challenge either This, or any other Divine Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, strictly and by way of <hi>Merit</hi>; but if so extended as to exclude the Singular Eye or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect God had to her Vertues and Graces in so grand an Affair as this was, is an absurd and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Doctrine.

               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.24.</note> should inhabit the Body, and cloath Himself with the Flesh and Blood of an Irreligious Woman. Far be this from our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions. The Holy <hi>IESVS</hi> undoubtedly had a very tender and special regard not only to <hi>the low estate,</hi> (Vers. 48.) but much more to the Piety of this Hand-maiden whom he design'd for his Mother.</p>
            <p>Not that I would here be thought in the least wise to affirm the <hi>Blessed Mary</hi> perfectly free from all Actual Sin, much less from Original Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I leave such Anti-Scriptural Doctrines to be Established by the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi>

               <item>1.

               <item>2.

                  </note> The Address in her Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension, most infinitely unsuitable to a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of her low Rank and Condition in the World. What! An Angel clad all in Robes of Glory, come to visit a poor mean Daughter of <hi>Israel?</hi> Can it be that Heaven should in Her, of all the Women in the World, find any thing that might incline God to respect and favour Her? She blushes upon the Angels Address; Sees and hears herself highly magnifi'd; Thinks
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98024:10"/>
upon the Message deeply; Considers it again and again: But after all, cannot apprehend any thing in herself which may in any wise correspond to the Angels Character: Her Modesty will not allow her to understand the least part of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the Angels Salutation. How she of all others should be the great Favourite of Heaven, advanc'd and honour'd above all her Sex, a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to be celebrated throughout all Ages, she can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not imagine. And as for her <hi>Humility,</hi> 'twas the same after her Exaltation as before. In her <hi>Magnificat,</hi> she expresses herself sensible of her low Condition; and takes occasion to meditate upon, and adore the Mercy of God, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects <hi>the Proud,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 5.5.</note> 
                  <hi>but gives Grace</hi> and Honour <hi>to the Humble. He hath scattered,</hi> says she, <hi>the Proud in the Imagination of their Hearts. He hath put down the Mighty from their seat, and hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted the Humble and Meek,</hi> Vers. 51, 52. Her Humility was one of the principal Graces which procur'd her this favour. God delights in this Grace in a peculiar manner; Loves those, and only those that are <hi>Humble:</hi> He loves and lives with them. <hi>Thus saith the high and lofty One, who inhabiteth Eternity, whose Name is Holy: I dwell in the high and holy Place; with him also that is of a contrite and humble Spirit, to revive
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:98024:10"/>
the Spirit of the Humble, and to revive the Heart of the Contrite Ones,</hi> Isai. 57. 15.</item>
            </list>
            <p>The next Grace observable in the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> is her <hi>Faith,</hi> express'd Vers. 38. <hi>Behold,</hi> says she, <hi>the Handmaid of the Lord; Be it unto me according to thy Word.</hi> She <hi>staggers not at the promise of God through unbelief,</hi> (to apply to her St. <hi>Pauls</hi> words concerning <hi>Abraham</hi> upon a much-like Argument) <hi>but is strong in Faith,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 4.20, 21.</note> 
               <hi>giving Glory to God; and being fully perswaded that what he had promised, he was able also to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.</hi> The Consideration of Omnipotency re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves all Doubts and Difficulties. To be a Mother without knowing a Man, is a strong Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection against her Faith: But that GOD can do in this case, as well as any other, what trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cends our Imaginations, is on the other hand as much out of question. And if he say he Will do it, the Divine Veracity, which is as infallible as his Power is infinite, is engag'd to a performance. And so she's undoubtedly assured that it must be so, though she cannot tell how. And thereupon she acquiesceth in what the Angel had told her, without any further Hesitancy or Contradiction: <hi>Behold,</hi> says she, freely resigning up herself to the Divine Pleasure, <hi>Behold the Handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:98024:11"/>But I shall not insist any longer upon the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Gifts and Graces wherewith the blessed Virgin was Endow'd; but shall only take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the profound Reverence and Honour which Antiquity paid Her in that Celebrated Opinion of theirs, That after she had given the consent just now mentioned, <hi>Be it unto me ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thy word,</hi> She was by singular Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge kept secure from all Actual Sin during her whole Life. An Opinion, I confess, entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able without any prejudice to our <hi>Holy Faith,</hi> and such as the <hi>Fathers</hi> who embrac'd it, took up certainly out of the great and awful Regard they had to the Dignity and Person of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; but such as has not the least Foundation in Scripture, and therefore may reasonably be laid aside, among many other ungrounded Eja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations, and over-officious Praises of a Saint, too honourably and advantageously represented in the Gospel as to her <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Piety,</hi> to need the Accession of our groundless extravagant Commendations.</p>
            <p>And if we cannot account the Zeal of some Ancient Fathers of the Church so discreet as well-meaning in this particular; What shall we say of that Abominable Superstition, which has induc'd the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and her Doctors to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:98024:11"/>
sally out so far in the Praises of the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> as to Romance her into a Deity? to attribute to her Divine Perfections, and to pay her that Religious Worship which belongs only to God?</p>
            <p>She was, says the Angel <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, that is, say they, <hi>Gratia plena, Full of Grace.</hi> And a very Gracious Person she was undoubtedly; so far we concur, and here we must leave them. For they go on, and with a Confidence befitting the Worshippers of <hi>Saints and Angels,</hi> mention'd by the Apostle, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 18. who should <hi>boldly intrude into those things which they had not seen</hi>; They affirm that her <hi>Fulness of Grace</hi> was such, that she was able to communicate it to any that wanted; in the very same manner, as our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our says,<note place="margin">Joh. 5.26.</note> that as <hi>the Father had Life in Himself, so had he given to the Son to have Life in Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</hi> Nay, <hi>Suarez.</hi> the Jesuite is wonderfully Nice and Critical in stating this <hi>Plenitude,</hi> and giving us an exact Estimate of it. <hi>The Grace of the</hi> Virgin Mary (says he,<note place="margin">3. Part. Disp. 18. Sect. 4.</note> upon the the Popish <hi>Hypothesis</hi> of her Immaculate Conception) <hi>was greater in the very first moment she was conceiv'd, than the Grace of the highest Angel, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently merited more than a thousand Men can merit all their Life long. Now this Grace of hers receiv'd
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:98024:12"/>
a continual Increase as long as she liv'd; in such a manner, that in the first instant of her Conception, her Grace excell'd that of the highest Angel, who by one or two Acts compleated his Merits. In the second instant, her Grace was doubl'd, and so was twice as Excellent and Meritorious as the former. In the third instant four times, in the fourth eight times as much as the first; and so on according to Geometrical Proportion. So that the Grace of every instant doubling its foregoing Grace from the moment in which she was conceiv'd, till the time of her Nativity; and afterwards every Act of Grace being in like manner twice as excellent as its precedent Act, till the Seventy Second Year of her Age, wherein she died; She was so far advanc'd in Goodness and Merit, as to have more Grace and Merit than the whole Society of Men and Angels put together: She is dearer to God than the whole Reasonable Creation; He loves her more than the Vniversal Church.</hi> What odd Metaphysical Notions are these! And yet a World of such Insignificant and Non-sensical Trash we meet with in the School-men: Who in their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses relating to the <hi>Holy Virgin,</hi> thought they could never be Romantic enough in describing the Praises, and advancing (after their dull rug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged fashion) the Merits of a Saint, whom the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98024:12"/>
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had in so singular a manner made the Object of a Religious Adoration.<note place="margin">Conc. Trid. Sess. 25.

            <p n="2">2. The second part of our Duty consists in the Celebration of her Memory, or in expressing to her upon account of her eminent <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Goodness,</hi> all due Respect and Veneration. The blessed Angel, you see, did this in his Address to her; <hi>Hail, Thou that art highly favour'd, the Lord is with Thee: Blessed art Thou among Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. Blessed art Thou</hi>; i. e. Let all Men Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour Thee, as an ever blessed Saint.

            <p>

                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap>, says the same Father, <hi>Though</hi> Mary <hi>be a most Excellent, Holy and Venerable Woman, yet is she by no means capable of a Religious Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi> And again, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>Let the Virgin be Reverenc'd, but God only Worshipp'd.</hi> So Zealous was <hi>Epiphanius</hi> in the matter of the <hi>Virgins</hi> Invocation, a piece of Superstition before his time not known in the World.</p>
            <p>What would he have said, had he seen this Idolatry of Worshipping the <hi>Virgin,</hi> (of calling upon her, and imploring her Mediation with Christ) grown into such a general Reputation, as to be Universally Practis'd, and Establish'd by
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:98024:15"/>
the <hi>Law</hi> of a Church,<note place="margin">Conc. Trid. Sess. 25. Art. 2.</note> which Glories in the style of <hi>Catholic?</hi> His Spirit undoubtedly upon Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of the Churches, Shrines and Altars E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to her Devotion, (as St. <hi>Pauls</hi> once was) would have been stirr'd within him, when he should have seen not only one particular City, but a whole Church wholly <hi>given to</hi> this and many other Branches of <hi>Idolatry</hi>: The <hi>Idols</hi> or <hi>Images</hi> set up in Honour of the <hi>Blessed Virgin,</hi> being infinitely more numerous, than those the great <hi>Apostle</hi> saw at <hi>Athens,</hi> and both made use of to the same Religious Ends and Purposes.</p>
            <p>Indeed the <hi>Romish Superstition</hi> relating to the <hi>Blessed Mary,</hi> as 'tis now practis'd, is infinitely too gross and absurd, to be in any tolerable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner accounted for, and justified. 'Tis wholly Anti-Scriptural; and 'tis evident the Church of Christ knew nothing at all of it for above three hundred years after our Saviour. Alas! The several Periods of the <hi>Rise</hi> and <hi>Growth</hi> of this <hi>Superstitious Folly</hi> and <hi>Will-Worship,</hi> as to all the parts of it, are too notorious, to allow it the least Pretensions to Antiquity. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Ephesus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Anno 431.</note> towards the beginning of the fourth Century, gave her indeed the style of <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, or <hi>Mother of God,</hi> in Opposition to the <hi>Nestorian Heresie:</hi> And I know very well that in
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:98024:15"/>
the Ages immediately succeeding, they fell to making lofty and unreasonably high Harangues in her Commendation. But 'twas above a thousand years after Christ before any <hi>Daily Office</hi> was Instituted to Her. And a long time after that was it ere the Doctrine of her <hi>Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate Conception</hi> appear'd in the World. The <hi>Canons</hi> of <hi>Lyons</hi> are the first Men upon Record, who inserted that Doctrine into their <hi>Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical Offices,</hi> and are upon that account sharply reprehended by St. <hi>Bernard.</hi> About three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years ago <hi>Duns Scotus</hi> a School-Doctor reviv'd That Opinion, and propos'd it as a thing meerly probable. In favour of it Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the Fourth afterwards Published a <hi>Bull,</hi> which was finally Approv'd and Ratifi'd by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Trent.</hi> So that She now passes among the <hi>Romanists</hi> (if they be true to the Decrees of their Church) for a <hi>Virgin perfectly free from Original Sin</hi>; not to mention the several other Prerogatives and Perfections they have out of very great kindness doubtless fix'd upon Her. They style her in their <hi>Missals</hi> and <hi>Offices, The Queen of Heaven, The Empress of the World, The Ladder of Paradise, The Gate of Salvation, The Mediatrix between God and Man, The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour by whom God hath sent Redemption unto
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98024:16"/>
his People, A Goddess, The Omnipotent Lady, &amp;c.</hi> And the peculiar Offices which have been instituted to her, are so extreamly Wild and Blasphemous, that I cannot mention what they speak of the <hi>Virgin,</hi> without offence to this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent and Noble Auditory.</p>

               <hi>Blessed Saint !</hi> Is this the Respect and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour which Thou requirest of Us, to build Thee Shrines and Temples, and then to pay to Thee in Them a Religious Worship? To offer up at Thy Altars our Devotions and Prayers, to run over our <hi>Rosaries,</hi> to say Ten <hi>Ave Maries</hi> for One <hi>Pater Noster; i. e.</hi> to make Ten Addresses to Thee, for One Prayer directed to Almighty God? (and this is the proportion observed in the <hi>Romish Devotions.</hi>) In a word, to transfer upon

Thee the <hi>Religious Reverence</hi> due to God as his own Peculiar Prerogative? Surely no. This is a sort of <hi>Complaisance</hi> or <hi>Humility</hi> (as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle speaks in the case of <hi>Angel Worship</hi>) which cannot possibly be grateful to Thee.<note place="margin">Col. 2.18.</note> We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not imagine that Thou canst at all delight in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving (if yet Thou art capable of receiving) from Us those <hi>Religious Services,</hi> which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pay Thee, without Injuring and Affronting Thy MAKER.

the hidden Man of the Heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the Ornament of a meek and quiet Spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.</hi>
