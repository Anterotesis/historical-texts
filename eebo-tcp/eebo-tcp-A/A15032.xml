         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>You put me in remembrance of a special
difference, that I obserued in <hi>Rome,</hi> which wel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth
your opinion, and is not impertinent to our
conference: being in <hi>Rome, Anno dommini</hi> 1580,
there was presented vnto the Pope a notale Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
shifter, who named himselfe <hi>Seamer,</hi> a one eyed
person, and such a one as had abused sundry greate
estates in <hi>Germanie:</hi> this man being in want, and
withall vnlearned as he could hardly read English
was a suter to the Pope to be entertained into the
English Seminary,<note place="margin">The disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the discribed by these exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples</note> and ther to be instructed in the
profession of the <hi>Iesuits,</hi> he soone obtained his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
and with a blessing of crownes was short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after commended to <hi>Rheames,</hi> and what there
became of him I haue not heard: at the same time,
there came to <hi>Rome</hi> an English Gentleman, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfullye
dronken with the zeale of the Romishe
religion, he had sometimes a proper lyuing, and
good store of mony lefte him by his father, which for
the most parte he consumed in the fellowship of the
Papists: in fine, he was enioyned by his confessor,
(I thinke vpon pollicye because he hadde little
lefte to maynetaine him) to resrayne from the
<pb facs="tcp:14328:26"/>
drinking of wine and from the eating of all manner
of flesh: in the execution of which pennance, (for that
in <hi>Italie</hi> there was smal store of fish, and no beere or
Ale, he was for the moste parte, driuen to liue with
bread and water: this Gentleman was so strickt in
obeying pennance, and so deuout in the Popes ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse,
as of a number of Papists he was derided:
&amp; of some other tickled, that he was a very Sainte
vpon earth: but what woulde <hi>Rome</hi> and all the
Seminaries of <hi>Italie</hi> doe for this ignorant and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout
Gentleman? Unto the shame of all Papists, I
truly certifie, that with many a weary step, in the
deepe of winter he arriued at <hi>Rome:</hi> he was (not
without some repining) entertained w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> eight daies
allowance in the <hi>English</hi> Colledge: but one daies
succour aboue, he could not compasse: he laboured to
be admitted into the fellowshippe of the <hi>Iesuits,</hi> he
was flatly denied, and in recompence of al his toile,
charge, &amp; zeale, he was constrained to leaue <hi>Rome</hi>
with a bare purse, to seeke some new blinde aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
his vsage made me to abhor the hipocrisie of
Papists, and inwardly to lament the blindnesse of
my poore countryman: we departed from <hi>Rome</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
my selfe minding to go vnto <hi>Vennis,</hi> and he
to <hi>Madona Deloreta.</hi> To showe all the follies of the
man in our iorney were tedious,<note place="margin">A blinde deuotion.</note> and more ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous:
at euery two miles end, there was (lightlie)
a Chappel, and where he found our Lady, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Saint fair painted, he would there kneel down
and pray, but if the Images were in bad attire, he
euermore past them ouer with the salutation of his
cap: many a mile he stepped foorth of his way, to

reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce some old friers relick: at <hi>Loreto</hi> he turned

the dead winter, from religious house, to religious
