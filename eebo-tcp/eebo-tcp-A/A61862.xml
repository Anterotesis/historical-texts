         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Acknowledge it a Satisfaction to me, that this
plain SERMON, preached at the late
Assizes, found such a general good Acceptation
both from the Iudges and Gentry, insomuch, that
many of them put you upon obliging me to make it
publick. But it added much to the satisfaction, that
the subject matter of the Discourse was so well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
by so great a Body of Honour and Quality,
as then appeared. Nor does it a little tend to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of that County, that the Magistrates and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
thereof allow so well of Discourses of this nature,
shewing hereby their True Affection to the <hi>Protestant
Religion,</hi> and to Christian Peace and Love, and how
sensible they are of the singular Mercies and Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
vouchsafed by God to this Nation, both in
former times, and of late especially.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:51308:3"/>
               <hi>Sir,</hi> You have the honour to be reserved for the
First Sheriff of <hi>Hertford-shire,</hi> under the Auspicious
Reign of <hi>KING WILLIAM</hi> and <hi>QUEEN
MARY.</hi> And it was your Happiness, as well as
your Honour, that you were laid aside from serving
that Office the last Year, after you were pricked and
published in the <hi>Gazette,</hi> in the List of the High
Sheriffs, as being judged, no doubt, too good an <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi>
man, and too true a Protestant, to serue the
Turn that was then driving on.</p>
            <p>I have, you see, in compliance with your desire,
exposed what I preached to publick view, praying
God it may be of some benefit to you, and all others,
that shall take the pains to read it, for the promoting
of Christian Wisdom and Sobriety; and then I have
my end. I am,</p>

SERMON
Preached at the
Assizes at Hertford,
IVLY viii. 1689.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>I SAM. XII. vii.</bibl>
               <q>Now therefore stand still, that I may
reason with you before the Lord, of
all the righteous Acts of the Lord,
which he did to you and to your Fathers.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>I Come not here to instruct Judges, not
to teach Magistrates their Duty: As this
would not become me to do, so neither,
I presume, do they need it, whose
great Wisdom And Gravity is able to direct them
in the Businesses that lie before them. Their
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51308:4"/>
Office indeed is as Weighty, as 'tis Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
to distribute Justice, to see good Laws
well executed, to right oppressed Innocence,
to bring Wickedness to Shame; in a Word, to
maintain the Kings Peace, and the Churches
Peace; a Great and Divine Employment. But
where there be Principles of Loyalty, and a
Love of Iustice planted in the mind, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with Piety to God, and a grave Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and many Years Experience; these are
far better Monitors than the best Preachers can
be: And I am persuaded I have Men enriched
with such Endowments to be my Auditors at
this Time.</p>
            <p>That I may not therefore seem to misdoubt
your Integrities or Abilities, Right Honourable
and Right Worshipful, nor expose my self to
the Censure of too much Assurance and Presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption;
and yet that I may speak in some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
to this present occasion, I have chosen
these Words, which are part of the Charge of
a great Judg in <hi>Israel,</hi> of whom the Scripture
gives this Character,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 7. 16.</note> That <hi>he went from year to
year in circuit to Bethel, and Gilgal, and Miz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>h,
and judged Israel in all those places:</hi> And so you
see the Words may be suitable in respect of
the Person that spake them. And they were
delivered at a very great and solemn Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51308:4"/>
of People, as yours now is; and so they
are suitable, in regard of the Auditory, that
heard them: And the Matter of them, being
a serious Exhortation to reflect upon God's
Goodness, and their own Ingratitude, can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
now, not at any time else, be unsuitable
for Ministers to preach, nor Christians to hear.</p>
            <p>Here, then, we have <hi>Samuel,</hi> the Judge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
his Charge; <hi>Now therefore stand still,
that I may reason with you before the Lord of all the
righteous Acts of the Lord, which he did to you and
to your fathers.</hi> The Word, which we translate,
<hi>Let me reason with you,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> is a Law Term among
the Hebrews, &amp; signifies, <hi>To plead and contend
in Iudgment</hi> for some wrong done: And is as
much as if the should have said, <hi>Let me plead on
God's side against you.</hi> A good Judg is alwaies
an Advocate on God's behalf, and zealous in
his Cause. <hi>Israel</hi> had wronged God, dealt
unjustly with him. How so? By sinning
against him: For every Sin is an Injury done to
God. <hi>Samuel</hi> now stands, and takes God's Part
against them, by shewing them how gracious
God had been to them, and how well he had
deserved at their Hands, by his Mercies and
Favours, expressed towards them; for so the
Word, which we render <hi>Righteous Acts,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> often
signifies: And by shewing them withal, how
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51308:5"/>
illy they had requited the Lord, disobeyed his
Commandments, and rebelled against their
Heavenly King.</p>
            <p>And that his Expostulation with them, from
the Topic of God's Goodness, might make the
deeper impression upon them, he descends in
the following Verses to enumerate the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Acts of God towards them:<note place="margin">Ver. 8.</note> 
               <hi>When Iacob
was come into Egypt, and your Fathers cried unto the
Lord, then the Lord sent Moses and Aaron, which
brought forth your Fathers out of Egypt.</hi> So that
their Escape out of <hi>Egypt</hi> was one of these <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,</hi>
or Merciful, <hi>Acts</hi> of God to them.</p>
            <p>And then it follows, <hi>And made them dwell in this
place. This place;</hi> that is, The Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi>
where they now were. That was another of
these eminent Favours, or <hi>Righteous Acts</hi> of the
Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And when they forgat the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ver. 9.</note> 
               <hi>be sold them into
the hand of Sisera, Captain of the Host of Hazor,
and into the hand of the Philistins, and into the hand
of the King of Moab; and they fought against them.
And they cried unto the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ver. 10.</note> &amp;c. <hi>And the Lord
sent Ierubbeal,<note place="margin">Ver. 11.</note> and Bedan, and Iephtbah, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,
and delivered you out of the hand of your
Enemies on every side, and ye dwelled safe.</hi> They
had Enemies, it seems, round about them,
that plotted and combined to destroy them;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51308:5"/>
but GOD alwaies interposed for their safety:
This is a Third Mercy of GOD vouchsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed
them.</p>
            <p>And upon these three signal Manifestations
of GOD's Goodness to them, the Prophet
<hi>Samuel</hi> grounds his reasoning with them: For
indeed they were Favours of that nature, that
the <hi>Iews</hi> could not think of them, but they
must needs have been touched with a quick
sense of the Distinguishing Love of GOD
to them, and under what mighty Obligations
they were to Him; as namely, to review them
again,</p>
            <p>I. That GOD had brought them away
from <hi>Egypt;</hi> where they were a poor, mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
oppressed People, under intolerable Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
crouching to an insulting proud Tyrant,
who laid unconscionable Tasks and Burthens
of hard Labour upon them.<note place="margin">Ex. 1. 14.</note> 
               <hi>Their Task-masters,</hi>
saith the Scripture, <hi>made their Lives
bitter with hard bondage in Mortar and in Brick<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
and in all manner of service in the Field.<note place="margin">Ch. 2. 23.</note> All their
service, wherein they made them to serve, was with
rigor.</hi> Insomuch, that it is said, <hi>They sighed and
groaned, by reason of their bondage.</hi> From all this
Severity and Anguish did their gracious GOD
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51308:6"/>
in due time give them an eminent and famous
Freedom.</p>
            <p>II. Another of God's Righteous Acts towards
them, was the planting them in the Land of
<hi>Canaan;</hi> where they were not only free from
the former Servitude, but lived plentifully and
prosperously. A Land therefore it is described
to be, <hi>flowing with Milk and Honey,</hi> fruitful, and
yielding all things for their service, use, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.
And here they lived under their own
Laws, in a wise and well constituted Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
having the true, standing, divine Service
of God settled among them. Oh, what a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Change was this to them, to exchange <hi>Egypt</hi>
for <hi>Canaan,</hi> the unmerciful Impositions of a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical
Prince, for the sweet and good Laws of
their Gracious and Heavenly King.</p>
            <p>III. The third Favour of God to <hi>Israel,</hi> that
<hi>Samuel</hi> here mentions, is not so much one single
Mercy as a Constellation of them; namely,
Their many Deliverances, after their settlement
in <hi>Canaan,</hi> from their Enemies round about them,
that envied their Peace, that were jealous of
their Happiness, and that laboured, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived,
and combined together, either to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51308:6"/>
them to their old Slavery again, or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
to ruine and root them out: But as often
as they rose up against them, so often did their
good God appear on their behalf, and by
strange and miraculous means sheltered this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
from their Malice, and continued their
Church, and preserved their State, in spight of
all attempts to the contrary.</p>
            <p>And these are the <hi>Righteous Acts</hi> of the Lord,
upon which this holy and good man is going
to reason with them. This is the Foundation,
upon which he builds the strength of his ensuing
Discourse. That considering these great Vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safements
of God, how obliged they were to
fear him, and cleave unto him with their whole
Hearts: And, Of what an high nature would
their Transgressions be, after all this kindness;
and, What shame, what sorrow, what repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
would suffice to ballance their ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>
            <p>And this is the method of <hi>Samuel</hi>'s arguing
with the <hi>Iews,</hi> from the Mercies of God to them;
and, no doubt, it made a very notable impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
upon their Hearts: An excellent Platform
and Direction this is for us to follow in our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations,
and when we call upon Men to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
their waies, and to amend them; We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

take a better course, more probable to have
a good effect, than this, which the Prophet <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi>
here useth; that is, To set before Men the
gracious dealings of God to them and their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
what Comforts and Refreshments he hath
bestowed on them; what Deliverances and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
he hath wrought for them; what visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and remarkable Tokens and Footsteps
of his Grace and Goodness they have seen
and felt; and then hereupon to argue and expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stulate
with them.</p>
            <p>And seeing, my Christian Brethren, we of
this Nation, with the <hi>Iews,</hi> have received great
and eminent Mercies at the hand of God, and
with the <hi>Iews</hi> also, our carriage and behaviour
towards him hath been no waies correspondent,
I shall therefore at this time follow the same
course and method that <hi>Samuel</hi> here does; and
for this purpose, give me leave in the first
place to bespeak you in <hi>Samuel</hi>'s very words.
<hi>Now therefore stand still, that I may reason with you
before the Lord, of all the righteous acts of the Lord,
which he did to YOU and YOUR Fathers.</hi> And here
I shall set before you the Mercies of God to you
and your Fathers, and then reason with you in
the presence of the Lord concerning them.</p>
            <div n="1" type="part">
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:51308:7"/>
               <head>I.</head>
               <p>Let me recollect the Righteous Acts,
or the Mercies, of the Lord. As for private and
personal Mercies, I shall not at all insist upon
them, but limit my Discourse only to those
that are publick and national, such as have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
to us as a Nation; for such are the <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
Acts</hi> meant in the Text. And here let us
reflect a little upon what God hath done for us
of this Nation. And upon search and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
we shall soon find, That his Goodness
hath been marvellous and abundant towards
us. Certainly, whatsoever great things other
Kingdoms may boast of, as received from the
hand of God, we of this Kingdom have had
our share. And truly, I think, if a man should
go all the World over, and take an account of
every People and Language, this Island of our
Nativity would be found to be the Happiest.
And tho' doubtless all others have reason to be
sensible of the Goodness of God to them in
many respects, yet we of this Nation have far
greater reason. We have swam in a greater
Sea of Mercies, and our Cup hath more over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed:
God hath given more notable and
famous marks of his Favour to us <hi>English-men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:51308:8"/>It will be convenient to mention some of
them, because particulars do more affect; and
as <hi>Samuel</hi> in this Chapter insisted chiefly upon
three sorts of Mercies vouchsafed to <hi>Israel;</hi> so
by way of Parallel, I will at this time reduce
the Mercies of God to our Nation, under
three Heads.</p>
               <p>I. The Deliverance of our Force-fathers from
the Spiritual <hi>Egypt, viz.</hi> The Bondage of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II. The placing us in a good Land, a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>III. The Protections that God hath given
us, from our Enemies round about us, that
combined together against us, like the <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anites</hi>
and the <hi>Perizzites,</hi> and the rest of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Nations, against <hi>Israel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I. I begin with the Deliverance of our Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers
from the Tyranny of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
of the <hi>Popish Religion.</hi> A Yoke, which our
Fathers, both Kings and People, many a year, had
grievously laboured under; when a foreign
Bishop had usurped Authority over our Estates
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51308:8"/>
and Liberties, our Souls and Consciences, in
that sort, as tho' we had all been made only
to serve the ends of his Ambition and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness;
and which was saddest of all, our
immortal Souls were in imminent hazard, by
reason of the wretched Ignorance, Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and false Worship Men were then nursell'd
up in.</p>
               <p>But the good GOD in due time looked
down upon us, pittied our Bondage, and
brought us up out of this <hi>Egypt,</hi> moving and
emboldening the Hearts of our Governours to
vindicate themselves from the Usurpations of
<hi>Rome,</hi> and to dismiss Superstition and Idolatry
from among us, and to set on foot a blessed
Reformation from those notorious Abuses and
Corruptions, in which our poor Church had
been so long wrapt up before. The Scriptures,
that shew unto us the Way of Salvation, lockt
up before, were now opened: Our Prayers,
that were hidden in an unknown Tongue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
made intelligible: Worshipping of Saints,
and making Addresses to Wood and Stone,
abrogated: The Holy Sacrament of the Lord's.
Supper, polluted by a Mass of Fooleries, and
Corruptions, and Errors, restored to its Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
use and practice; and a reasonable Service
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51308:9"/>
celebrated, and Preachers appointed to teach
and instruct men, concerning the Contents of
our Holy Religion; and Means of Saving-knowledg
more and more brake in upon us
And thus we were then delivered.</p>
               <p>And this Mercy of God will appear to be the
greater, if we consider what a small part of
<hi>Christendome,</hi> in comparison, enjoy it beside our
selves. God seemed to have picked us out
from the rest of the World, to manifest This
his Kindness to; for the greater part of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
still sit in Darkness, concerning CHRIST
and his Religion; and while their Priests pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to keep knowledge, they communicate
little enough to them; they tell them, it is
enough for them to believe as the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves,
That they must resolve their Faith into
the Authority of the Church: But what the
Faith of the Church is, they need not trouble
themselves to know, let them but hear Mass and
mumble over their Rosaries and their Latin
Prayers; let them but kiss a Crucifix, and kneel
before a Saints Image, and sprinkle themselves
with Holy Water, and arm themselves with the
sign of the Cross, and 'tis enough.</p>
               <p>This, I say, is the condition of most Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;
but God hath dealt more bountifully with
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51308:9"/>
you my Brethren; He hath given you means
of more perfect knowledge of JESUS CHRIST,
and of the way and means of Salvation by
him.</p>
               <p>In a word, We have our Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that had been defac'd, blotted, and blur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by Popish Superstition, cleansed from its
Corruptions, and restored to us as it was in the
Primitive Ages; a most invaluable Mercy and
Blessing! so that nothing now remains for us
to do, but to live according to the knowledge
and means of Grace which we have. And
this is one Rank of Divine Favours vouchsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed
us of this Nation, <hi>viz.</hi> Our deliverance
from the Bondage and Tyranny of <hi>Rome,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
to that of the <hi>Iews</hi> from <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II. Another singular Mercy of God to this
Nation, parallel to that God vouchsafed the
<hi>Iews,</hi> is the good Land, wherein God hath
planted us. As the former concerned our spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Good, so this our Temporal; indeed a
blessed Country ours is, a true <hi>Canaan,</hi> a Land
flowing with Milk and Honey. The British
Islands were antiently and truly reckoned one of
the best and happiest Soyles in the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:51308:10"/>And here I might insist upon the Fruitfulness
of the Land, the Plenty of all things for the
Life and uses of Men; the Temperature and
Wholsomness of the Clime; the Health and
long Age of the Inhabitants; the Manners and
Dispositions of the People, who are naturally
Loyal and True, Sober and Manly, Coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
and Valiant: For so the antient Inhabitants
were reputed to be; and if they are not all so
now, 'tis owing to their Sins, whereby many
of us have marred and emasculated our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>Moreover, I might insist upon the happy
Situation of this Island, walled about with Seas,
to defend us from Foreign Invasion, that am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
Princes may not so easily make Inroads
upon us, and bring in their destructive Armies;
God hath placed us in a World by our selves,
and we were therefore sometimes called, <hi>Alter
Orbis, The other World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Under the consideration of the Happiness of
our Country, I might likewise entertain you
with a Discourse of our moderate and easie Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and wholesome Laws: Our Kings
rule by Law, and are not arbitrary; our Laws
are framed and modelled by our own Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives;
and so, in effect, we are under Laws
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51308:10"/>
of our own making. And among the rest of
the Priviledges of the <hi>English Nation,</hi> this must
not be forgotten, at this time especially, That
for the saving us both the Labour and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences
of long Journies up to <hi>Westminster-Hall,</hi>
the Reverend the Judges leave their Seats there
for our Ease and Convenience; and are sent
down among us, twice a Year, in these
their Circuits, to hear and determine our Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances,
and to do us Right, and to take Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
on Malefactors, the common Mischieves
of a Country. And thus Justice is brought home,
as it were, to our own Doors.</p>
               <p>In all which Respects, many wife Men, not
only our Country-men, who may be thought
to speak partially, but Foreigners, have held
the <hi>English Government,</hi> To be one of the best
constituted Governments in the World.</p>
               <p>These things I can now but mention; but
these, well thought on, will enhance the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
of this second Rank of Mercies, referring
to the Country, wherein God hath placed us,
insomuch that we may truly use the Words of
the Psalmist, <hi>The lines are fallen to us in a pleasant
place, and we have a goodly Heritage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:51308:11"/>III. There is another Mercy still behind,
wherein God hath resembled us to his own
People the <hi>Iews;</hi> and that is, The Protection
of our Church and our Land from the Malicious
and Unwearied Attempts of our Enemies. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous
have been the Deliverances that God
hath wrought for us, from Foreign Invasion
and Domestick Conspiracy.</p>
               <p>I need but mention the <hi>Invincible Armada,</hi> in
the Year 88. when the Pope and the King of
<hi>Spain,</hi> and the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> marshalled up
all their Strength and Wealth, and set forth the
greatest Fleet that ever the Sea bore, with an
intent to invade our Land, to massacre our
Persons, and to reduce us to the old <hi>Egyptian
Bondage</hi> again: But here the Winds and the Seas
were on our side, and fought for us; and then
God <hi>shewed strength with his own arm, and scattered
the proud in the imagination of their hearts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I can but name that prodigious and unheard of
Plot of Gun Powder, that should have made
but one stroke of the three Estates, and cut
them off at one blow; whereby both our Civil
Government and our Protestant Religion should
have been dispatched at once: But this, God,
by a strange Discovery, disappointed also.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:51308:11"/>And when, of later times, we were embroil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in lamentable Civil Wars, and the Lord's
anointed, our Natural Sovereign, slain by
wicked Hands, and our antient Government
subverted; in due time did the good God
take pity upon the sad Estate of these Kingdoms,
and brought back our Natural Prince, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
our Counsellors, as at the beginning,
and gave us our old Government again in
Church and State. And thus God delivered
us then also.</p>
               <p>But there are later Deliverances than any of
these, fresh in our Memories; wherein our
merciful God hath aggrandized his Mercy, and
magnified his Goodness to us; namely, in the
two last Kings Reigns, when so many Plots
and mischievous Projects were hatching and
secretly carrying on against us; and of late more
openly and avowedly, by our implacable Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of <hi>Rome,</hi> to enslave our free-born Persons,
to overthrow our antient Government; and,
which was worst of all, to extirpate our excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Protestant Religion; having also the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of Authority on their side; and a
powerful standing Army to back them: And
they thought, and so indeed did we all, That
their Work was as good as done; nor had we
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:51308:12"/>
the least Crevise of Hope, but began to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
for Suffering, and to submit our Necks,
as patiently as we could, to that heavy Yoke,
which neither we nor our Fathers were able to
bear. But, behold! in this very juncture,
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, did God, beyond our Hopes, or
very thoughts, raise up another <hi>Cyrus</hi> to his
People, who by a train of Miraculous and
Strange Successes, which we ought piousty to
attribute to the special Influence of Heaven,
recover and restore this despairing Nation to its
Property, Liberty, Peace, Religion, and
every thing else that was dear and precious unto
us; and we have a very fair Prospect, if our
Sins and Follies do not prevent, of much future
Tranquillity.</p>
               <p>And truly, to add this to the rest, It is a
Mercy of God, not to be forgotten, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the <hi>Iesuites</hi> and <hi>Emissaries</hi> of
<hi>Rome,</hi> have all along from Generation to Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
from one King's Reign to another,
been so busie to overturn us, though they bring
up Youth in Foreign Schools, founded on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to plot Treasons, and compass the Ruine
of our Kings and Kingdom; they have never
yet these hundred Years and upwards, been able
to effect their cursed Designs: And what is all
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:51308:12"/>
this to be attributed to, but the special Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God over us? God still blasts them,
disappoints them, discovers them, counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines
them, makes them false to one another;
and we have, blessed be God, a Protestant
King, and a Protestant Religion still; such,
such have been the miraculous Appearances of
God for this Church and Nation.</p>
               <q>O nimium dilecta Deo—</q>
               <p>O thou Nation of <hi>England,</hi> beloved of God, too
much, beyond thy Deserts.</p>
               <p>And thus I have set before you the Mercies
of God, his righteous Acts towards us and our
Fathers: Thus Good, thus Gracious hath he
been, so happy hath he rendred us, so often
hath he delivered us, so tender hath he been of
us, as if he had adopted us for his second <hi>Israel;</hi>
he hath dealt with us, indeed, as his Children,
as his Friends, as his Beloved: <hi>How abundant,
O Lord, is thy goodness to the Sons of Men? the
memorial of thine abundant goodness shall be shewed,
and men shall sing of thy greatness: One generation
shall praise thy works unto another, and declane thy
power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:51308:13"/>And thus I have finished the first Stage of my
Discourse, and that was, To recollect unto
your Thoughts the Righteous Acts of the Lord.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="part">
               <head>II.</head>
               <p>And now I come to reason with you here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
What shall we say to these things? But
that my Reasoning with you may be the more
effectual, and make the more deep and lasting
Impression, I should discourse, if I had Time,
from these three Heads.</p>
               <p>I. To consider what such gracious Dealings
of God, do in all Justice and Equity call for.</p>
               <p>II. What our behaviour hath been.</p>
               <p>III. To expostulate and reason with you
upon the whole Matter.</p>
               <p>I. To consider what such gracious Dealings
of God do in all Justice require of us: for
natural Reason will dictate to us, That there
doth arise an Obligation upon us from Favours
received, so that in Point of Equity certain
Duties are owing to our Friend, or our Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:51308:13"/>
or he that hath contributed toward the
Comfort of our Life; but above all, when the
great God of Heaven and Earth, who is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
above us, takes Care of us, and is
some waies or other notably beneficial to us;
What is Man now to do? certainly his Heart
ought to be lift up in Thankfulness to the great
Benefactor: His Mind ought alwaies to bear
the Characters of the Divine Goodness en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven
upon it, as it were with the Pen of a
Diamond: And this Sense of Divine Favour
ought to express it self by demeaning our
selves loyally towards that God, from whose
Hands these Favours have fallen; by loving
him, fearing him, obeying his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and complying with his blessed Will,
and by devoting and submitting our selves
intirely unto him. But,</p>
               <p>II. Let us see what our Behaviour hath
been: We have been such as have participated,
in a large manner, of the Bounty of Heaven,
as I have shewn you already; the Paths of
God have been all Mercy and Truth to us,
and to our Fathers before us. But now, to
come nearer to you, What have you done
for God? Where has your Gratitude, your
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51308:14"/>
Loyalty been to him? Have God's Mercies
made us any whit the better? Nay are we
not the worse? Have we not kicked against
him, when he hath sed us to the full? Have
not the Lives of many of us been such, as if
they were led on purpose to confront him?
As if we were resolved to offend him? As
if we cared not for his Favour? How often
have we sinned against God, when with the
same Ease we might not have sinned, or have
done somewhat that might have pleased him?
How frothy and unchristian have our Words
and Discourses been? How unjust and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous,
and uneven our Dealings? If
we have been in Prosperity, how forgetful
have we been of him? How insolently have
we carried our selves? How have we
trampled upon our Inferiors, and oppressed
our Underlings? If we have been in Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity,
how unadvisedly have we spoken
with our Tongues? into what Indecencies
hath our Passion, or Anger, or Sorrow dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
us.</p>
               <p>But particularly, what little Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
have we born towards that infinite
Mercy of restoring the true Religion to us?
We pretend, indeed, to value and love
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51308:14"/>
our Religion. We speak much of our Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
in professing it; We shew great Dislike
and Abhorrence of <hi>Rome</hi> and her Practices;
but alas! our Lives bear no Proportion to our
Words and Professions.</p>
               <p>And here I may take up the Complaint
that an <hi>English Protestant</hi> Writer,<note place="margin">Tho. Deacon <hi>in his Preface to his</hi> Iewel of Ioy.</note> in the very
beginning of the Reformation, and of Fame
in those Times, used in reference to this
Matter: <q>What a Swarm of gross Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellers
have we among us? who can prat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of the Gospel very finely, talk much
of the Justification of Faith, crack very
stoutly of the free remission of all their Sins
by <hi>Christ's</hi> Blood, avaunce themselves to
be of the number of those, which are
predestinate unto everlasting Glory: But
how far doth their Life differ from all true
Christianity? they are puft up with all kind
of Pride, they swell with all kind of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,
Hatred, Malice &amp; Enmity against
their Neighbour; they brenne with unquench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Lusts of Carnal Concupiscence; they
wallow and tumble in all kind of beastly
Pleasure; their greedy covetous Affections
are unsariable; the enlarging of their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships,
the encreasing of their Substance,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51308:15"/>
the scraping together of worldly Possessions,
infinite, and knoweth no End. In fine,
all their Endeavours tend unto this End,
to shew themselves very Ethnicks, and
utterly estranged from God in their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations,
although in Words they otherwise
pretend<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all their Religion consists in
Words and Disputes; in Christian Actions
and godly Deeds, nothing at all</q> And so
he goes on.</p>
               <p>This then you see hath been a Charge;
that hath stuck on the Protestants from the
very first Times of our Reformation, in the
Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> VI and I am afraid those Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
may more truly be taken up against
them in these degenerate, backsliding Daies
of ours; I appeal to your selves for the Truth
of these things. Thus good hath God been to
us, and thus froward and disingenuous have we
been to him.</p>
               <p>III. And now, in the third Place, let me
expostulate and reason with you upon the
whole matter: Is it possible, that the goodness
of God hath had no better, Success upon us?
Have we thus required the Lord, foolish
People and unwise? What strange Stupidity
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:51308:15"/>
possesseth us, that we carry our selves so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>towardly
toward the best Friend we have in
all the World? Was ever more disingenuity
or folly known? Disingenuity, to affront so
good a God, to be so base there where we
have been so kindly dealt with; and Folly too,
in exposing our selves to the Effects of that
Fury, that is begotten of Kindness abused.</p>
               <p>Let us at last be persuaded to leave these
Courses: Oh! be not so weak, to suffer
so vile a thing as Sin to impose upon thee?
What? Shall I dishonour my God? Shall I
displease him? Shall I be guilty of so gross
Ingratitude to my dearest Benefactor? And
all this only to gratifie a Lust? Shall I sooner
listen to a Passion, to a Folly, than to my
God? Hath Sin deserved better of me than
God hath? Oh! far be it from me. And
certainly this Expostulation will take hold of
all Men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that have any Spark of Ingenuity
in them. For these things, that I am now dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing,
touch upon the tenderest part of the
Soul, and make a very close Address unto the
igenuous Part of it.</p>
               <p>I shall propound one or two good Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
to you, with reference to the present Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
and so make an end.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:51308:16"/>I. In reference to the Mercies of God in
general, endeavour to bear and keep up a
quick Sense of them alwaies upon your
Minds: Oh! bear about with you these
Marks of Divine Love and Favour: The
Remembrance of them will be of excellent
Use for the checking us in our Careers of
Sin, and the forwarding us in the Course of
Piety; for a Man can scarcely think of God's
Goodness to him, and at the same time play
the Villain and the Rebel against him. But
on the contrary, God's Mercies will enkindle
a Love of God in our Hearts; and if we
love him, we shall obey him, and do and
suffer any thing for his sake. And therefore,
I say, let not the goodness of God depart
out of your Minds, but frequently call upon
your Souls,<note place="margin">Psal. 103. 2, 3.</note> as <hi>David</hi> did upon his, <hi>Bless the
Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me, bless
his holy name: Bless the Lord, O my Soul, and
forget not all his Benefits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II. and lastly, as to the Mercy of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Religion in particular, the Counsel I
would give you in relation to this is, that
we walk answerably unto it; and that our
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51308:16"/>
behaviour be such, as may become it. And
there are two things that are great Ornaments
unto it, and that will set a mighty Lustre
upon it, and indeed are indispensably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
by it: The one is a <hi>Peaceable Spirit,</hi>
and the other a <hi>Holy Life.</hi> Peace and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
which are both joyned together in one
Verse,<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Follow peace with all men, and holiness;</hi>
and they are recommended unto us by the
most prevalent Argument that can possibly be
invented, because without them <hi>no man shall
see the Lord:</hi> seeing the Lord in Heaven, in
Glory, being made Partakers of the blisful
Vision, depends upon the pursuit of Peace and
Holiness.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>Peace,</hi> That venerable, sacred, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable
thing: <hi>Peace,</hi> the great primary Law
of our Holy Religion; the truest distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Character of a right Christian; the best
Prop and Pillar of Christianity. <hi>Quid est
Christianismus si Pax absit?</hi> said <hi>Erasmus, What
is Christianity it self without Peace?</hi> As though
it could not subsist without Peace, that there
could scarce be Christianity without it. Nay,
it is the Happiness of Heaven: There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
there but a sweet union of Spirits, and
harmony of Souls; and, in a word, it is the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:51308:17"/>
Name that GOD himself is called by, <hi>viz.
The God of Peace.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 13. 20.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore this is to be preserved <hi>sarta
tecta,</hi> by all the care and means possible.
And because our difference in Opinion is so
apt to do violence to this Sacred Badg of
Christianity, let us take great care, whatsoever
our Judgments be, that it have not that very
bad influence upon any of us. And to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
this, either let us sacrifice our private
Opinions to Peace, which is of far greater va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
than our Opinions can be; or, if we do
not that, yet by providing by all possible means
against disturbances and clamour, and all bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
zeal: And that we may do, partly by
concealing our different Judgments, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
our Faith to our selves,<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 22.</note> as the Apostle
adviseth; partly by complying with, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirting
to the Customs of the National
Church, as far as we can possibly, that so
far as lies in us, we may live peaceably with
all men; partly by being modest in our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents,
not confident or stiff in our own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits,
apt to think charitably of those that
differ from us; not fond of a Party, nor cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>I am for Paul, and I for Apollos;</hi> nor
cherishing Prejudices against all that are not
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:51308:17"/>
of our own way. It is a thing of a very bad
consequence, and oftentimes falls out to the
breach of Christian Peace and Love, that we
usually espouse a Side, and then we are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
to our selves, and very critical in espy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
faults in others, and rigorous in censuring
and condemning the Practices of all besides
our own Party.</p>
               <p>It brings to my mind a Passage, that we
read in our Books,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gilbert. Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liot. God.</hi> Caral. of Bishops,</note> of a certain Bishop of
<hi>Lendon</hi> in King <hi>Henry</hi> II. his Reign. This
man discoursing one day with a Friend of
his, concerning this temper, saith he, <q>When
I first entred into a Monastery, I was wont
to blame very much the sluggishness of my
Governours: When I became a Prior, I would
complain of Abbots: Afterwards arising to
the Honour of an Abbot, I favoured my
fellow-Abbots, but ceased not to reprehend
Bishops: And lastly, When I was a Bishop
my self, I began to see how much more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
a thing it is to find Faults than to mend
them.</q> By which he did shew, in himself,
the temper of most men, how apt they are to
favour their own side, and how diligent to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
their Superiors, and how ready to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
with all of a different Order, Sect, or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:51308:18"/>
And withal, upon maturity of
Years and Judgment, he gave us to see, how
unreasonable and childish this is; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that it is much better to be of a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
modest Spirit, to cover some defects
that we espy in others, and not to think our
selves without fault, alwaies remembring, that
<hi>There is nothing perfect under the Sun.</hi> And this
would prove an excellent means for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
and pacifying the Minds of Christians
to one another, and for the promoting of
Peace.</p>
               <p>Let us then <hi>labour after the things that make
for peace: Let us seek peace and ensue it,</hi> and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
our selves the true Disciples and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine
Followers of the loving and peaceable
JESUS, by being peaceable and peace makers
our selves. He was of a peaceable Spirit, and
underwent much for Peace sake, and was the
great Pacificator between GOD and Man;
the infinite Benefits whereof, such as the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
of our Sins, and the blessed Hope of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Peace, we Christians feel, to our great
and endless Comfort; the consideration of
which Blessed things, brought about by our
great Peace-maker, should make us Friends,
and Sons of Peace.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:51308:18"/>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> To <hi>Peace</hi> join <hi>Holiness;</hi> and indeed
the one is a proper Door and Entrance into
the other: The <hi>peaceable</hi> Christian is the only
probable Man to make a truly <hi>holy</hi> Christian.
When the Soul is calm, and the storms of Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and Contention are all lay'd and still;
then the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of Peace and
Love enters. Let not the profession of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
serve thy turn, without the Spirit and
Life of it. Be very conscientious in all the
great and divine Laws of it, Mortification
and Self-denial, Justice and Temperance,
Humility and Patience, Meekness and Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Love and Good-will, subduing our Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
and bridling our Passions, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our Spirits under Discipline, and framing
our Minds more and more to a relish and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in holy Exercises, to a love of God, to
a contempt of the World, to an ardent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to be admitted into that Coelestial State
above.</p>
               <p>This is the true divine Life and Spirit, that
becomes all the Professors of the Gospel, that
should be their chief End, and their great and
earnest Care, as they would walk worthy of
that holy Name, whereby they are called.
And when all is done, after all our talk and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:51308:19"/>
dispute; after all our heats and contests;
after all our Books and Writings, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
so effectual to make God our Friend;
nothing so much adorns our Excellent <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Religion,</hi> and better secures it to us and
our Posterity: In a word, nothing treasures up
so much solid Peace and holy Assurance unto
our Souls, as the sincere honest application of
our selves to the Practicals of RELIGION.</p>
