            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AS nothing more imports the ſons of men, than a judicious ſearch after the certain knowledge of that Eternal Truth, in which alone ability is plac'd to free from thoſe ſins and entanglements the luſtful eye and wanton mind have naturally ſubjected them unto, and into which they are ſo deeply intricated; ſo can there nothing prove more dangerous, than an implicit reception of ſuch Principles as daily ſteal out of the Preſs; Some are ſo very imbecile, as that they crave a ſupport from the Ingenuity of their Friends to vindicate their Cauſe; whilst others better skill'd, cunningly can inſinuate their Sentiments (however defective, being truly examined) under the plauſibility of language, and reſemblance of reaſon: but though I am willing to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge no Age more ſhatter'd and in pieces about Religious concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, than this we live in (ſome ſplitting on the Rocks of Atheiſm, whilst others creep into the ſhallow Creeks of bare Profeſſion) yet with great confidence I can impeach Man as the ground of his own diſtracted and miſerable eſtate; for ſuch hath been and is the curious and inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive mind of Man, that as he would be wiſe above what is written, ſo is he moſt impatient in his ſearch; and overlooking that ſufficiency given him of God, to act in his divine and humane capacity, is either buſily forming out of his brainſick fancies, rather what he would have God, Man, and Religion to be, than what they really are; or elſe, being born under ſome generally received apprehenſions and Articles of Faith, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Diſcipline, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſo entirely hurried away with the variety of earthly pleaſures, or diverted by fears, that they can find no leiſure to enquire how far they bear any proportion with ſound Reaſon and true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: Both theſe ſo much experimented evils, are the undeniable oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of that inhumane entertainment ſuch have met withal, whom God at any time hath ſent to teſtifie againſt the invented wayes, words, works and worſhips of this degenerated world; looking on it as an into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable affront, that not only they ſhould be exploded for Hereticks, but that the Faith of their Zealous Anceſtors ſhould come in queſtion, it may be by Reformers of no better rank than poor Mechanicks; forgetting it was the Channel, through which God in all Ages hath been pleaſed to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52322:3"/>
convey the ſtreams of Divine Knowledge; and 'twas indeed moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous with God's Omnipotence, to let the lofty worldlings know, how able he was by mean and contemptible Inſtruments to effect the confuſion of them and their Inventions.</p>
            <p>This never was more expreſly verified, than in the progreſs made by that deſpiſed-Generation of Pilgrims, call'd <hi>Quakers,</hi> who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all that oppoſition of Powers Eccleſiaſtical and Civil, and their many Stratagems imbattell'd to ſcatter and deſtroy them, are yet a People; and with no other weapons, than a holy, inoffenſive and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring converſation, have valiantly warr'd through the many Armies of their Enemies, and in the Wiſdom of him that call'd them forth, been able to undermine &amp; circumvent their moſt Machiavilian Conſpiracies; which leads me to give thee an account of my thus appearing in thy view: I can aſſure thee 'tis no forwardneſs to gain the reputation of a Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, ſince that vain glory my Principle prohibits, and ſhould moſt wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly have left this for another, did not neceſſity lay it ſtrictly on me.</p>
            <p>Amongst the many peviſh Adverſaries I have met with, who have ventured to oppoſe and ſlander that Innocent People, I ſcarce know one who has more made it his concern than my Antagoniſt; for beſides what either this treats of under my examination, or another anciently printed, under the protection of a large Dedicatory Epiſtle to <hi>O. Cromwel,</hi> the acquaintance I have had with him by paper and perſonal conference, as well as the punctual information I have received concerning his practice through all our Revolutions (which I may term a Touchſtone for Integrity) will by no means dispence with my paſſing by this Guide un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animadverted: for truly, <hi>Reader,</hi> I cannot but in ſincerity aſſure thee, that a Religious pity will not have me ſilent, ſince when I narrowly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the paſſages of his life, and then remark the very drift of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe (abundantly confuſed, as will appear in this ſhort Reply) I really find it is to palliate his own nakedneſs, and if poſſible, not only to confirm all Temporizers like himſelf, but alſo by his little inſinuations of pretended Chriſtian Tenderneſs, to beguile the chaſte minds of others into a defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a cringing and conforming ſpirit: all which ſtrongly excites me to preſent thee with a Confutation of his Religion, a Reprehenſion of his Asperſions, a Detection of his Hypocriſie, and Compariſon of his Contradictions; that being once unmask'd, he may appear in all his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections, and his Diſguiſe never prove injurious unto any.</p>

               <p>ALthough I eaſily ſhall confeſs Religion to be mans chiefeſt Concernment, and that his eternal bliſs does indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly depend upon the ſound belief and conſtant practice of the true one; yet when I retroſpect upon that time I once imploy'd in a converſation with Books, and call to mind the excellent Defence of <hi>Origen;</hi> and Apology of <hi>Tertullian</hi> on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of thoſe primitive Chriſtians, and alſo the Learning, Gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Reaſon of <hi>Du Pleſſy, Grotius, Amiraldus, &amp;c.</hi> who in their time were truly honourable, and Modern Writers on the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, I cannot but acknowledge my ſelf ſurpriz'd, to find a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe ſo raw and undigeſted as <hi>Jonath. Clapham's,</hi> ventring abroad with no leſs title than <hi>A Guide to the true Religion;</hi> thereby im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying, either the inſufficiency of what already has been writ, or ſelf-conceitedneſs, that the abilities of none can better claim ſo great an office: whilſt in very truth he has but ſhewn himſelf a Novice in the task he hath undertook; which will but draw the eyes of all thoſe Infidels and Hereticks (againſt whom he doth ſo zealouſly contend) from peruſing that which carries with it more of Reaſon for their Confutation and Convincement, to encounter him, a match of much leſs conſequence: ſo that his ignorance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes their refuge, and his proofleſs accuſations, groſs contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and often tautologies, ſtrong grounds for a confirmation in their reſpective perſwaſions: and if that which he terms <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> had no better Champion than he ſeems to be, nor more Zeal to ſuffer whatever comes, than Reaſon to defend it, he may as well turn <hi>Jew, Turk</hi> or <hi>Heathen;</hi> as manifeſtly he hath <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian, Independent, Epiſcopal:</hi> but leſt I may be cenſured for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning that in him which I allow in my ſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> bare Aſſertions without a proof, I ſhall deſcend to the examining of thoſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, which may moſt deſerve our conſideration.</p>

                  <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> who <hi>for many years</hi> (he ſayes) <hi>have been diſtracted:</hi> but I'le refer it to thy judgment, <hi>Reader,</hi> whether this <hi>new Guide</hi> be little better, who dares to call <hi>diſtracted people, Chriſtian Churches,</hi> or Chriſt's Churches <hi>diſtracted: Paul</hi> bore another record, when he deſcribes the Church of Chriſt <hi>without ſpot, wrinkle or blemiſh:</hi> but whilſt he would ſeem to allow many diſſenting parties the title of <hi>Chriſtian Churches,</hi> it muſt be remembred he elſe would have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded himſelf from being other than an Infidel, who as occaſion ſerv'd, has been of four; yet how palpable a contradiction this will be, not only to the Scripture, but the deſign of his whole Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, may appear upon the peruſal of its latter part, where he not only adviſes all to acquieſce in the preſent conſtitution of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but ſeems to lay it as a charge upon the reſt, pleading ſtrongly (as he thinks) for their complyance, not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering if they equally deſerve the name of <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> they conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently are independant; and ſince he doth allow the one to be no more Chriſtian than the others, why any ſhould impoſe upon, or injoyn obedience from its Siſter-Churches, I cannot find any thing in ſound Reaſon or Scripture to warrant it: to mend, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther marr the matter, he in ſo many words, calls thoſe very Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches he own'd for Chriſtian in one page, <hi>a reproach to the Chriſtian Religion, and infamous through the world</hi> in the very next; but how <note place="margin">Epist. p. 2.</note> infamous his expreſſion is, I beſeech thee, <hi>Reader,</hi> to obſerve, that daies expoſe ſuch fooliſh and irreverent terms to publick view, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling what's Chriſtian, <hi>infamous,</hi> or rather what's infamous, <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian;</hi> methinks he ſhould better have conſulted his own reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſince having been a Miniſter to moſt of them, his ſhare has not been ſmall in their reproach and infamy.</p>
               <p>He marches on without fear, wit or wiſdom, telling us, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment of his Book, <hi>is to help against thoſe evils, and to direct thoſe who are apt to miſcarry through occaſion of diverſity of opinions, and</hi>

to walk in, will appear, if we conſider the wavering of his own mind, who as it conſiſted with his intereſt, has been alwayes ready to welcome every new Power with a leading complyance; and if none would more concern themſelves for his preſent opinion, than he has for his paſt, his inconſtancy would not deceive them in his eſpouſing the next Conſtitution that may come.</p>
               <p>And that I may not be miſtaken in my conjectures of the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this Treatiſe, reade but a little further and thou wilt find a confirmation in his own words, who does not only account thoſe the <hi>best Chriſtians,</hi> himſelf, <hi>which have through all thoſe great Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions</hi>

God to have created and formed man in body, ſoul and ſpirit, that it be not reaſonable to conclude no other could inveſt Man with Religious Principles, and a propenſity to worſhip a Deity? and can it be admitted by any ſober perſon, the Principle God hath beſtowed on man ſhould be natural, and yet religious; imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and yet the gift of God? ſurely there can be none ſo dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſighted as not to diſcern theſe very groſs contradictions: for if God has impreſt on man ſuch a Religious Principle, to teach him to adore a Deity (which muſt be himſelf, or elſe it would not anſwer the end for which it was given) what is it leſs than to declare that God hath diſtributed unto every man ſuch a proportion of his pure Spirit, and meaſure of his Grace, as might enable him in thought, word and deed to perform that good, that acceptable and perfect will of God? and that the ground of thoſe diviſions in Religion, fallibility in Judgement, cruelty in Diſpoſition, and all other A bominations that like a deluge overflow the World, is not the Inſufficiency of that Divine Principle, but from neglecting and diſregarding the Righteous Dictates and Inſtructions of it: And let him not deny it to be the ſame it was, who bears this Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>that</hi> it <hi>cannot be razed out,</hi> ſo deeply (is it his opinion, as well as truth) has the infinitly divine Sculpter ingraven the characters of his eternal Law on the hearts of all Nations, that no time or alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration amongſt men can poſſibly obliterate or deface it.</p>

               <p>And for thoſe two expreſſions of Scripture quoted by him, they both are wreſted beyond their genuine ſenſe: I can allow the beſt of men to know but in part, and not ſubmit to his imperfect ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions; for not to mention many Scriptures, nor tediouſly to argue, there is a Perfection which conſiſts in an entire ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the pollutions of the World, as abſolutely neceſſary and <note place="margin">Respectu termini a quo.</note> congenious to the ſecond <hi>Adam's</hi> ſtate, or qualification of a true Chriſtian; and a Perfection relating to that more ample and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal enjoyment of all divine knowledg and celeſtial raviſhment, <note place="margin">Reſpectu termini ad quem.</note> when theſe earthly tabernacles ſhall be diſſolv'd: I ſhall in ſhort ſay, that as this place was urg'd to overthrow the doctrine of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and conſequently inſinuate that popularly pleaſing opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſin for term of life, ſo could he never have found a more expreſs parable to vindicate it by. If Chriſt's interpretation ought to be of moſt authority, which is this; <hi>The Field's the World, the Good Seed are the Children of the Kingdom, but the Tares are the

Children of the wicked-one,</hi> he will be greatly diſappointed of his end, which alſo the very Parable refutes from the nature of the Tares and Wheat: for as I have already ſaid, if he will not argue an imperfection to <hi>Believers,</hi> from that which is already granted to <hi>Unbelievers,</hi> there needs no more diſpute about the matter; but if by a confeſt non-perfection in that greater number of <hi>Tares,</hi> or unrighteous men, he therefore will conclude there is no perfect <hi>Wheat</hi> or godly men, this were to contradict the expreſs end and very purpoſe of the Parable: but ſince the nature of the <hi>Wheat</hi> admits no mixture with the <hi>Tares</hi> parabollically, it follows really that the Children of the Kingdom ſhould have no relation or fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with, but be ſeparated from the nature of the wicked one, and converſation of his children, which is more particularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd in thoſe places where 'tis ſaid, <hi>He which ſinneth is of the Devil, but he that is born of God ſinneth not, becauſe the Seed of God</hi>

               </p>
               <p>—Taking the former part of his Definition for granted, to wit, <hi>the perfection, infinity, and ſpirituality of his Nature,</hi> how very unſuitable herewith is the Religion and practice of this Guide, firſt in denying that Revelation by which only a knowledge of this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and inviſible Deity can be obtained, which was the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Chriſt bore concerning him, that <hi>no man knew the Father but the</hi>

               <p>Next; If there be no other way to have communion with this inviſible God, that thereby the Conformity he talks of may be known, (for being a Spirit, it's prepoſterous to imagine a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

of him obtainable by other <hi>mediums</hi> (than what are aedequate to his Divine Nature) but by this Revelation of Himſelf through his Son Chriſt (in us, except we are Reprobates); it will neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily follow that he muſt either deny Chriſt's Doctrine, or elſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs himſelf ignorant of what he writes: and ſince the God he would adviſe all to know, fear and love, is that perfect Spirit, I fain would know what Worſhip can be termed ſuitable thereunto, but the internal and ſpiritual one? which is altogether void of thoſe Ceremonies, Formalities, Will-performances, and periſhing Obſervations, once uſed as condeſcending ſigns to the weakneſs of ſome ſeaſons, which at this day fills up the Sacrifices, and in which ſtands the Religion of thoſe called <hi>Chriſtians</hi> through the World; whoſe ignorance of God's once diſpenſing with beggarly elements, for their ſakes whoſe underſtandings were vailed and too weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſighted to behold at firſt the glorious Light, has put many upon the imitation of paſt generations, though void of their ſpirit, and not anſwering the end for which they were then practiſed, vainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiting them an offering acceptable to the eternal Spirit, when it were as well-pleaſing to preſent a dogg's neck, as anciently was ſaid. <note place="margin">Iſa. 1. 13, 14. 15. ch. 66. 3</note>
               </p>
               <p>What ſhall I hence conclude, but as the Almighty God is a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſo cannot he otherwiſe be known or ſerved; and ſince he has required homage from his creatures, and yet's ſo purely juſt as to but expect what he has impow'red them to do, how abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary is it that all Worſhip Godward ſhould ſtand in the ability given of him thereunto, and reaſonable to believe that the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of all the Apoſtacy, Darkneſs, Inventions, and whole variety of Forms and Conſtitutions of Religion, has been from the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of that pure ſpiritual capacity, once given of God to act and order them in all things that did concern their duty both to God and man.</p>
               <p>As for his ſtrange diſtinction of the Deity, which he inforces on the faith of all that value their eternal welfare, I cannot find one Scripture that will bear him out; and if they had been of ſo much credit with this Guide as to have been by them led into their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable form of ſound words, he would not have intruded Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition for Scripture to the creed of any, but rather have inſerted the Text or phraſe it ſelf, whoſe Authority might have commanded

If he will tell me it is a myſterious Point, and therefore did forbear a farther diſcuſſion of it.

               <p>He has here drawn up an Article out of Scripture-Record, but never tells us what he has experienced in the matter, confidently bidding all embrace and believe it, without any farther examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of its verity or conviction from the Spirit of God, whoſe office it is <hi>to convince the World of ſin.</hi> And I ſhall boldly affirm, That this forward putting people upon the entertainment of Notions, (though of Truth it ſelf) whilſt the Spirit of the Living God is not at work, or moves not on the Waters, is but the forming up that very Righteouſneſs which is the ſecond office of the eternal Spirit to convince of, and condemn the World for; A confutation <note place="margin">John 16. 8, 9, 10.</note> to his own Principles and Practiſes, is apparent in the latter part of this ſecond Fundamental; for if they who are <hi>ſanctified</hi> and <hi>convicted</hi> are no <hi>hainous offenders,</hi> then will it reaſonably follow, That ſuch as are <hi>hainous offenders</hi> are not <hi>ſanctified</hi> and <hi>converted:</hi> But this Guide, with all his Tribe, that are daily crying, <hi>They do the things they ought not, and have no health in them, are hainous offenders;</hi> therefore they never knew the ſaving health of

all Nations, nor yet have felt the Blood that purges, that Spirit which ſanctifies, that Word which converts to God. Again, the Holy God is perfect, and has no fellowſhip with one unfruitful work of darkneſs; but this Guide allows that man muſt be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled, or elſe he lies under the curſe of the Law, therefore there is a poſſibility, nay a neceſſity of mans being perfect, which to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, is to contradict his allowed reconciliation, unleſs he can tell where to fetch a proof, That the moſt pure God will have fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with, or be reconciled to, whatever is not of his moſt perfect Nature; nor is it ſenſe to ſay, the Creature can be reconciled, whilſt in the commiſſion of that the curſe for ever lies upon.

Then muſt not Reader from my querying thus conclude, We do deny (as he hath falſly charged us) thoſe Glorious Three which bear record in Heaven, the Father, Word, and Spirit, neither the Infinity, Eternity, and Divinity of Jeſus Chriſt, for that we know he is the Mighty God; nor what the Father ſent his Son to do on the behalf of loſt man, declaring to the whole World, We know no other Name, by which Atonement, Salvation, and Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Redemption comes; but by his Name, are according to our meaſures made ſenſible of its mighty Power: but rather to let thee ſee how unſatisfactorily he has impoſed Religion on the World, and how exceeding open he layes his Principles to the objection of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reaſonable Inquirer; for whilſt he undertakes to dreſs up a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion that ſhall excel all others, and boldly recommends it to ſuch who are reſolved to be of ſome Religion (as if there did accompany it ſuch undenyable evidence, that though it might effect little up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the looſe and diſſolute Atheiſt, to fix his moving mind, yet queſtions not the good ſucceſs it might have upon the Religiouſly inclined) he in reality has not brought a Proof or ſolid Argument, as encouragement for any to embrace them.</p>

               <p>He boldly calls him his Redeemer, not obſerving how unſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble his Life and Doctrine is with the Redeemed: of the Lord; for whoſoever is redeemed by Chriſt, is perfectly ſo, inasmuch as all his Works are perfect; but as this Guide's converſation manifeſts the contrary by his very great miſcarriages, ſo does his Book; for
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52322:15"/>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> teſtifies to all, <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt was ſent to redeem,</hi> not onely <hi>from iniquity,</hi> (which might admit of a diſtinction by froward and unclean Spirits) but <hi>all iniquity;</hi> therefore this perſon has ſpoke <note place="margin">Tit. 2. 14.</note> too largely in calling the pure Jeſus his Redeemer, for ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect works would very much diſgrace their Author; nor is there any thing ſo much ſtumbles Infidels, and brings a reproach upon the Chriſtian Religion, or diſhonour to the Holy God, is Prieſts and People, writing, talking, and fighting hard for Chriſt as Redeemer, whilſt every eye finds them as polluted, and deeply engaged in diſhoneſt and immoral practices, as thoſe againſt whom they contend.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And truly repenting of their ſins, ſhall reſt on his death and merits alone for life, and love him above all things, and ſincerely obey his Goſpel, Laws, and Commandments, and ſhall perſevere in this duty to the end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I hope by this time Reader, thou art ſufficiently convinc'd this Guide is leading thee to a ſtate of perfection, notwithſtanding he would make thee believe it's unattainable in this life; for he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes we ought to love God above all; and is it poſſible for any mind, but that which walks with God, is born again, and entirely tranſlated from the Kingdom of darkneſs, into the Kingdom of Gods marvellous Light, to be ſo entirely divorc'd from all, and eſpouſed to God, as <hi>to love him above all;</hi> and <hi>ſincerely</hi> (which implies no leſs than the ſtrongeſt activity of an upright Soul) <hi>obey his Goſpel, Laws and Commandments, and perſevere,</hi> which excludes all commiſſion or omiſſion to the contrary.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, if Chriſts Law be imperfect, then muſt its Author be ſo too; but he is purely perfect, ſo muſt his Work or Law: And if the Law be perfect, then is the obſerver alſo perfect, but the Law and Goſpel is prov'd undeniably perfect, therefore muſt the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver alſo. And leſt this Guide ſhould offer to retort, that none can obſerve it, let him anſwer for me, who ſayes, We ought not only to <hi>obſerve and obey it, but with ſincerity, and perſeverance in fulfilling the commands of it to the end.</hi> Finis coronat opus, <hi>The end'd perfection.</hi>

                  <hi>Reader,</hi> thou needſt not be a man ſo very judicious, (although our Cauſe, being by moſt peruſed with a prejudiced eye, deſires thee to be impartial) rightly to taſte what the ingredients and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions are that do compoſe this Spirit, who at the very entrance manifeſts himſelf thus intoxicated, that he has already over-ſhot both verity and good manners; thereby preparing the minds of ſuch as reade him, to entertain his Falſities the moſt he can for the diſadvantage of our perſons and principles: This front of his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment, calls for my Anſwer in theſe reſpects; (1.) We ſtand charg'd as to our <hi>want of Learning and external accompliſhments.</hi> It is our joy and matter of rejoycing, and many times with unutter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thankſgivings in ſincerity I can ſay, that the everlaſting God ſhould now, as frequently at other times, diſplay the Riches of his Love and Grace to the mean and deſpiſed amongſt men; herein is it tranſcending in our eye, that he ſhould abſcond theſe things, and leave them ſtill as myſteries to the wiſe world, whilſt in extream love he has ſo plentifully vouchſafed the revelation of them unto babes; and therein made good that ancient obſervation of <hi>Paul,</hi> in <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 26, 27, 28</note> our times, <hi>Not many Wiſe, not many Noble;</hi> not that we thereby do exclude any, only we can affirm, that the entrance of God's everlaſting Goſpel of Salvation, or whatever he has had to do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the ſons of men, has been with very ſeemingly deſpicable attendances. This ought not to be dubious unto any intelligent perſon that has but given himſelf a moderate acquaintance with Hiſtory. If I ſhould go no further than the Scriptures of Truth, let it be there examined, and 'twill appear if ſuch whom God call'd at any time (from the beginning to the end) were not Handicraft, Labouring, and Husband-men, perſons inexpert in the Scholaſtick Adages, Diſputations and Opinions of the Heatheniſh Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical World.

               </p>
               <p>Reader, If yet thou art a ſtranger to this Light he thus explodes and vilifies, let me beſeech thee once to obſerve it in thy ſelf, and tell me then if it has not that Divine quality to diſcern be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Precious and the Vile, and manifeſt every Thought, Word, and Act? whether it is well-pleaſing, or the contrary, to the great God?

               <p>And for his confident affirming we ſlight both Scriptures and

His fifth reflection is, <hi>Our openly denying the Doctrine of the Trinity:</hi> but me thinks it would become him who is reproving others for not paying that reſpect they ought unto the Scriptures, to be a little more exemplary in uſing their unqueſtionable phraſe, and ſound expreſſion, for I am altogether ignorant of any Scripture that mentions that word <hi>Trinity;</hi> and tis his own Opinion, that Fundamentals ſhould not be drawn from dubious and obſcure pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but rather that the Scriptures were evident and perſpicuous, as to what was neceſſary to be believed; yet if by Trinity he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands thoſe three Witneſſes in Heaven, Father, Word, and Spirit, he ſhould better have acquainted himſelf with what we diſown, than ignorantly thus to blaze abroad our open denyal of what we moſt abſolutely credit and believe.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Fain would he here inſinuate to people, by his moſt invective impoſtures, hard thoughts concerning an inoffenſive people, whilſt in reality they own no other name by which Salvation is obtainable than the Chriſt of God; and all the Offices that ever were aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him by his Father, are by them acknowledged; and ſo remote are they from hiding their ſentiments, or being jealous of expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them to all, that whoſoever will but give himſelf the time of frequenting their Meetings, or peruſing their Books, will ſoon perceive how very far this Character is wide of Truth.</p>

of ſome eſſay, or new <hi>Atlantis</hi> in Religion, as might (if not) deſerve an approbation of its Doctrine, at leaſt have manifeſted the ingenuity of its Author; but to find the gleanings of ſome mouldy Authors, and dark ſuggeſtions of unwarrantable Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, venture to put a cheat upon the World, under the ſpecious Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of a <hi>Guide,</hi> (who had not gone a page before he loſt his way) at once expreſt more ignorance and impudence than any piece I have met with ſince I have held the leaſt intelligence with Books; and I hope what hath been already writ, will by thee be eſteem'd a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient anſwer to this Guide, and ſo unvizard his deſigns, as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou or any elſe from thence ſhall take the leaſt encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to embrace his Religion, or give entertainment to his falſe Aſperſions, but rather am willing to believe, that perſons ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and deliberate, will never look upon a time-ſerving Prieſt, thus circumſtantiated with great variety of miſdemeanours, or any thing his parts and mallice can ſuggeſt, ſo favourably, as to accept his ſentiments to the apparent prejudice of ſuch, whoſe carriage and correſpondence amongſt men, are in the general confeſt to be diſcreet and friendly; for if the Perſons inveſted with Authority ſhall once admit of implicit apprehenſions for their Rule, and that from one whoſe very actions carry ſuch undeniable malignity with them, thoſe differing Perſwaſions againſt whom he may have treaſur'd up revenge, muſt certainly expect the effects of their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity and diſpleaſure, let them in other matters, where publick preſervation is concern'd, appear never ſo ready and contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.</p>
               <p>But ſuch procedures reliſh rather of Romiſh bigottry, and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane inquiſition, than Chriſtian tenderneſs and humane prudence: For as a gentle treatment of Diſſenters has ever been the moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual way for uniting differences in Religion, (at leaſt preſerving of the peace) ſo ſhould all Magiſtrates remember (if they pleaſe) that their Authority cannot reaſonably extend beyond the end for which it was appointed, which being not to inthrone them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Sovereign Moderators in cauſes purely Conſcientious, and relating to a World in which they cannot pretend the leaſt Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, but onely to maintain the impartial execution of Juſtice, in regulating civil matters with moſt advantage to the tranquility, enrichment and reputation of their Territories, they ſhould not
