         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In which there is a very vast er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, because such persons imagine they have some authority over Spirits, and that Spirits may be compelled by humane authority, which is altogether impossible, since humane Energy or Authority is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour by much to that of Spirits. Besides, they admit a more vast mistake, supposing such natural instruments, as they use, to be able either to call up, or drive away any wicked Spirit. And they continue their mistake in endeavouring by Invocations, Deprecations or Sacrifices to please Spirits, making them propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to their design. Without all questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the way is incomparably more easie
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50764:9"/>
to obtain any thing, that is truly good for men, of God, or good Angels, then of wicked Spirits. As for things which are incommodious for men, wicked Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits can no further yeeld assistance, then they have permission, for the sins of the sonnes of men, from that God, who go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns and directs all humane affairs. Hence therefore I shall conclude (these things being beyond, or rather against the Rules of Wisdome) No true Philosopher did ever regard to work by any of these six wayes.</p>

               <p>WHat men ought to believe touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Figures, Charms, and such stuff, I shall deliver my opinion. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt there is nothing in these dayes of this kind, but what is either deceitfull, dubious, or irrational, which Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers formerly invented to hide their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret operations of Nature and Art from the eyes of an unworthy generation. For instance, if the virtue of the Load-stone,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50764:9"/>
whereby it draws iron to it were not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, some one or other who hath a mind hereby to cosen the people, so goes about his businesse, as lest any by-stander should discover the work of attraction to be natural, he casts Figures, and mutters forth some Charmes. Thus many things lie dark in Philosophical writings; in which the wiser sort of Readers will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse so much discretion, as reject the Figures and Charmes, eying the works of Nature and Art, that so they may see the mutual concurrence of animate and inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate creatures, occasioned by Natures conformity, not any efficacy of Figures or Charmes. This is the cause why the unlearned crew have judged such natural or artificial operations to be meerly Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical. And some fond Magicians beleeve, That their casting of Figures and Charmes was the sole cause of such operations; hereupon leaving their natural and artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial operations have stuck close to their erroneous casting of Figures and Charms. And thus they both have by their own folly deprived themselves of the benefit of the others wisdome. In times past, godly and religious men,<note place="margin">N<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Neither must men be believed, who would assure us, That <hi>Solomon,</hi> or some other of our sage Progenitors were Authors of such Books, because those Books are not received either by the Churches Authority, or by any prudent men, but only by a few cheating Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions

to be the works of such men. Mine own experience assures me they compose and set forth new works and inventions of their own, in lofty high flown expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the more colourably to make their lies passe under the shelter of the Text; prefixing some specious titles, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to set them off, impudently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe such bastard births to famous Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors.</p>

then another man. The Reason may be, the Nature of Complexion and infirmity yeelds obedience to the thoughts of the Heart, and is more augmented by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervention of our desires. Hence it is that a leprous person, who is solicitous, desirous and fancying to infect some one or other in the room, may more easily and force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably effect it, than he which hath no such intention, fancy or desire. For (as <hi>Avi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen</hi> observes in the fore<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cited place) the nature of the body is obedient to the thoughts, and more intent fancies of the soul. And (as <hi>Avicen</hi> in the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 
                  <hi>Metaph.</hi> affirms) the thought is the first mover, after that the desire is made conformable to the thought, then after that the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral virtue, which is in the members, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beys the desire and thought; and thus it is both in good and bad effects. Hence it is that a young man of a good Complexion, healthfull, fair, well featured Body, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his soul not debauched with sinne, but of a strong fancy and vehement desire to compasse the effecting of some magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent designe, withall adding the power of his Virtues, <hi>Species</hi> and natural heat; He may by the force of these <note n="*" place="margin">Al. <hi>Species.</hi>
                  </note> Spirits, Vapours and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50764:14"/>
work both more powerfully and vehemently, than if he should want any of these fore-going qualifications, especially strong affections and force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able imaginations. Hence I conclude, Men by the concurrence of the foresaid Causes, Words and Works being the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments, bring great undertakings to perfection.</p>
               <p>As for words, they are hatched within, by the thoughts and desires of the mind, sent abroad by heat, <hi>Vocale arteries,</hi> and motion of the Spirits. The places of their generation are in open passages, by which there is a great efflux of such spirits, heat, vapours, virtues, and <hi>Species,</hi> as are made by the soul and heart. And therefore words may so farre cause alterations by these parts or passages, as their Nature will extend. For it's evident, That breathings, yawnings, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral resolutions of Spirits and heat come thorow these open passages from the heart and inward parts: Now if these words come from an infirm and evil complexion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated body, they are constantly obnoxious. But if from a pure sound and wholsome constitution, they are very beneficial and comfortable. It's clear then, That the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50764:14"/>
bare generation and prolation of words joyned with desire and intention are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable in natural operations. Hereupon we do justly say, <hi>Vox viva magnam ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet virtutem</hi>; Living words are of great Virtue. Not that they have any such Virtue of doing or undoing, as <hi>Magicians</hi> speak of, but only they have the Virtue of Nature, which makes me put in this Caution of being extream cautelous here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. For a man may, as many have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy done, erre on both hands: Some wholly denying any operation of words: Others superfluously decline to a Magical use thereof. Our duties should be to have a care of such Books, as are fraught with Charms, Figures, Orizons, Conjurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Sacrifices, or the like, because they are purely Magical. For instance, the Book <hi>De Officiis Spirituum, liber de morte animae, liber de art<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> notariâ,</hi> with infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite others, containing neither precepts of Nature or Art, having nothing save Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical Fopperies. Yet herewithall we must remember, there are many Books com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly reputed to be Magical, but have no other fault then discovering the dignity of wisdome. What Books are suspicious, and what not; Every discreet Readers
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50764:15"/>
experience will show him. The Book which discovers natural or artificial opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions imbrace; that which is void of either or leave both, as suspitious and unworthy the consideration of any wise man. 'Tis usual with <hi>Magicians,</hi> to treat of both unnecessary and superfluous subjects. 'Twas excellently said of <hi>Isaac</hi> (<hi>in lib. de Febribus,</hi>) <hi>The rational soul is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peded in its operations, unlesse by the Manicles of ignorance.</hi> And <hi>Aristotle</hi> is of opinion, (<hi>in lib. secret.</hi>) <hi>That a clear and strong intellect, being impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the influences of divine Virtue, may attain to any thing which is necessary.</hi> And in 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Meteor, he saith, <hi>There is no influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence or power, but from God.</hi> In the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of his Ethicks, <hi>There is no Virtue, whether Moral or Natural without divine influence.</hi> Hence it is, that when we dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of particular agents, we exclude not the Regiment of the universal Agent, and first Cause of all things. For every first Cause hath more influence on the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, than any second Cause, as he speaks in the first proposition of Causes.</p>

               <p>It's possible to make a Chariot move with an inestimable swiftnesse (such as the <hi>Currus falcati</hi> were, wherein our fore fathers of old fought,) and this motion to be without the help of any li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving creature.</p>
               <p>It's possible to make Engines for flying, a man sitting in the midst whereof, by turning onely about

an Instrument, which moves artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Wings made to beat the Aire, much after the fashion of a Birds flight.</p>
               <p>It's possible to invent an Engine of a little bulk, yet of great efficacy, either to the depressing or elevation of the very greatest weight, which would be of much consequence in several Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents: For hereby a man may either ascend or descend any walls, delivering himself or comrads from prison; and this Engine is only three fingers high, and four broad.</p>

               <p>A man may make an Engine, whereby without any corporal danger, he may walk in the bottome of the Sea, or other water. These <hi>Alexander</hi> (as the Heathen Astronomer assures us) used to see the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of the deeps.</p>
               <p>Such Engines as these were of old, and are made even in our dayes. These all of them (excepting only that instrument of flying, which I never saw or know any,

               <p>THe physical figuration of rayes are found out to be very admirable.

As <hi>Pliny</hi> in the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Book, Nat.

                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:50764:17"/>This designe may seem advantagious to strike terrours into an Enemies Camp or Garison, there being a multiplication of appearances of Srarres, or men as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled purposely to destroy them: Especially if the following designe be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to the former (<hi>viz.</hi>) Glasses so cast, that things at hand may appear at distance, and things at distance, as hard at hand: yea so farre may the designe be driven, as the least letters may be read, and things reckoned at an incredible distance, yea starres shine in what place you please. A way, as is verily believed, <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> took by grear Glasses from the Coasts of <hi>France,</hi> to view the site and disposition of stoth the Castles and Sea-Towns in great <hi>Britain.</hi> By the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Glasses, bodies of the largest bulk, may in appearance be contracted to a minute volumne, things little in themselves show great, while others tall and lofty appear low and creeping, things creeping and low, high and mighty, things private and hidden to be clear and manifest. For as <hi>Socrates</hi> did discover a Dragon, whose pestiferous breathings and influences corrupted both City and Countrey thereabouts, to have
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:50764:17"/>
his residence in the Caverns of the Mountains. So may any other thing done in an Enemies Camp or Garison, be discovered. Glasses may be framed to send forth <hi>Species,</hi> and poisonous infectious influences, whither a man pleaseth. And this invention <hi>Aristotle</hi> shewed <hi>Alexander,</hi> by which he ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the poison of a Basilisk upon the Wall of a City, which held out against his Army, conveyed the very poison into the City it self. Glasses may be so framed and placed, as that any man coming into a room, shall undoubtedly imagine he sees heaps of gold, sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, prceious stones, or what you please, though upon his approach to the place he shall perceive his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake.</p>
               <p>It's then folly to seek the effecting that by Magical Illusions, which the power of Philosophy can demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate.</p>
               <p>To speak of the more sublimate powers of Figurations, leading and congregating rayes by several Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and reflexions to what distance we please, so as any object may prove combustible. It's evident by Perspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives

they burn backward and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, which Authours have treated on in their Books.

An Invention of more satisfaction to a discreet head, than a Kings Crown.</p>

                  </note>and other combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stibles. To proceed, Lamps may be made to burn, and waters to keep hot perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally. For I know many things which are not consumed in the fire, as the Salaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders skin Talk, with others, which by some adjunct both are inflamed and shine, yet are not consumed, but rather purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Besides these, we may speak of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50764:19"/>
admirable peeces of <note n="*" place="margin">Art it should be, as I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</note> Nature. As the making Thunder and Lightning in the Air; yea with a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er advantage of horrour, then those which are onely produced by Nature. For a very competent quantity of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter rightly prepared (the bignesse of ones thumb) will make a most hideous noise and corruscation, this may be done several wayes; by which a City or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my may be overcome, much after the fashion as <hi>Gideon</hi> overcame that vast Army of the <hi>Midianites</hi> with three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men, by the breaking of their Pitchers, and shining of their Lamps, together with the sudden leaping forth of the fire, and inestimable cracklings. These would appear strange, if they were designed to their just height both of proportion and matter. I might produce many strange works of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind, which though they bring no sensible profit, yet contain an ineffible spectacle of wit, and may be applied to the probation of all such secrets, as the ignorant crew will not imbrace. Such might I name the attraction of Iron to the Loadstone, a thing so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulous,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50764:19"/>
as none save an eye-witnesse would believe. And in this attraction of Iron, experience will show a diligent searcher, more wonders than any vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar capacity can entertain.</p>
               <p>But to proceed to greater, and more than these. There is an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of gold, silver, and all other metals,<note place="margin">

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:50764:20"/>
such materials and artifice, as it might have a natural diurnal motion. Which seems to me possible; and because many things are moved with the motion of the Heavens, as Comets, the Sea tides, with several other things, which are turned about either in the whole or in part. Such a work might be thought more miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and of a vaster benefit than any thing hitherto mentioned. For the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of this would frustrate all other, whether the more curious, or the more vulgar Astronomical Instruments, which surely would be more valuable than a Kings Coffers; and yet there may matters be brought to passe, which though they will not reach so near a miracle, yet of farre greater publick and private profit.

               <p>THe furthest attainment, which the complement of Art, joyned with the whole Energy of Nature can reach unto, is the Prolongation of Life to a very old date. How farre this is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable, manifold experience hath shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us. <hi>Pliny</hi> reports, That <hi>Pollio,</hi> a man of a strong body and mind,<note place="margin">

                     </gap>cens,</hi> through the use of a Medicine lived five hundred years. For the King, whose Captive he was, having received this Medicine from the Embassadours of the great King, and being suspitious of them, made tryal hereof upon this Captive, which was brought him for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. And the Lady of the Woods in great <hi>Britanny</hi> searching for a white Hinde, found an Ointment, wherewith the Keeper of the Woods anointed his whole body, except the soals of his feet, and he lived three hundred years without any corruption, save in the soals of his feet, which had some passions. We our selves know it frequent in these dayes, That plain Countrey men, without the advantage so much as of a Physicians advice, live very healthfully an hundred years, or little lesse. And these are the rather confirmed by the operations of Animals, as Harts, Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:50764:22"/>
Serpents, and many others, who by the efficacy of heart or stones, have renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their youth: And wise men seeing, that even bruits could reach so farre to their Prolongation, adjudging it no lesse feasable by reasonable men, set them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves on the Spurre to find out this secret. Hereupon <hi>Artefius</hi> from his own ingenuity, having found the Secrets, of Stones, Herbs, Sensibles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> both for the knowledge of Nature, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Prolongation of Life, did <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Al.</hi> Glory.</note> rejoyce, that he had lived 1025. yeares. Further, to confirme this Assertion of the Prolon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Life, it's considerable, That man naturally is immortal, that is to say, <hi>Potens non mori,</hi> hath a possibility of not dying. Yea, even after his fall, he might live a thousand years, though by degrees the length of life was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breviated. Hence it follows, That this abbreviation is Accidental, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentially may be repaired in whole or in part; and upon search we shall find the accidental cause of this corruption, is not from the Heavens, or any other than the defect of true Government of our health. In that our Fathers are
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:50764:22"/>

               <p>For that which all men, which wise, and the more noted men affirme is truth. That therefore which is held by the multitude, as a multitude, must be false; I mean of that multitude, which is distinct from knowing men.

                  </note>) And this their ignorance of the proprieties and Secrets, makes the division from knowing men. Though the common conception of the mind, have all one Rule and Agreement with knowing men. Yet as for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon things, they are of small va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, nor enquirable for themselves, but rather for particular and proper ends.</p>
               <p>The Reason then, why wise men have obscured their Mysteries from the multitue, was, because of their deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and slighting wise mens Secrets of wisdome, being also ignorant to make a right use of such excellent mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. For if an accident help them to the knowledge of a worthy Mystery, they wrest and abuse it to the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold inconvenience of persons and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities. Hee's then not discreet, who writes any Secret, unlesse he conceal it from the vulgar, and make the more intelligent pay some labour and sweat before they understand it. In this
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:50764:26"/>
stream the whole fleet of wise men have sailed from the beginning of all, obscuring many wayes the abstruser parts of wisdome from the capacity of the generality. Some by Characters and Verses have delivered many Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets. Others by aenigmatical and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurative words, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> sayes, (<hi>in lib.
