            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>LAmbs of the Fold, in the Love of the Shepherd, I greet you all, and my Soul is poured out to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you, that are in the Birth-right, and Heir-ſhip of Life, unto which the Arm of the Lord hath gathered us to inherit, and ſit together in Heavenly Places, and to ſhew forth his praiſes; he hath put it into our hearts to do his Will, to ſtand up for his Truth, and to bear our Teſtimonie againſt Antichriſt; even we, who were neither Prophets, nor Prophets Sons, hath the Lord by his Spirit ſent forth to confound the Wiſdom of the Wiſe; yea, he hath raiſed his Truth in the Hearts of thouſands, the Preacher of Glad Tidings, even the Goſpel of Peace, by which many are brought to bear a Faithful Teſtimonie againſt deceit; he hath ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered us, and ſaved us, and nurſed us in his Boſom, and fed us with the Milk of his Word; He hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened us, and Illuminated us, and Led us, and Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us; yea, he hath trained us in the Word of Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and cloathed us with the Armour of Light, &amp; taught us the Poſtures of War; He hath given us Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, Courage, Man-hood, Boldneſs and Ability to indure hitherto; He hath overturned and tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the Earth, Heaps upon Heaps; He hath Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected Councellers, the Potent and Learned, the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45549:2"/>Noble and Ignoble, Profeſſors and Prophane, even he hath Bolted up their Way, and Strangled their Conceptions, and Broken their Images, and divided them, and made a way for us, and covered our heads in the day of Battel, and fought for us by the ſecret Motions of his Power, in the Hearts of our Enemies: And now for his Truths Sake, he hath provided his Furnace and Fining-Pot, to try all thoſe Mettles that had ſuch a pleaſant ſound, even the great ſwelling words of Vanity: them that have, and do ſay, They are Jews, Chriſtians, and true Believers and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers, even all that are contrary to the Furnace <hi>(viz.)</hi> the Lords Refining Fire, muſt feel its Flame, or ſee the Terror of it, and ſo in the Fearfulneſſe give up their Power, and Bow to the Image of the Beaſt. But the reſolved in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, that are given up freely to him that hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to Righteouſneſs, they ſhall be ſaved, and their Salvation the Heathen ſhall Admire; Stand up there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ye counted for the Slaughter, Hath our Captain forſaken us? Hath the Trumpet left ſounding? Is the Alarum ceaſed? Is the Earth at Peace, and the Beaſt ſtill? Doth not the Lyon roar, his Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion even unto <hi>Babylon</hi> that great City? Is the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement made between Light and Darkneſs, and the Unity confirmed between the Temple of God, and that of Idols? Is the Peace made? (then my Friends) What means this purſuit? What means this Preparation for War, againſt the Lamb and his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my? Is not the noiſe of the Chariots of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the ſtrength of the <hi>Philiſtians</hi> come up againſt <hi>Mount-Sion,</hi> with their choiceſt Snares? Have not they pitched their Tents againſt <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (the beloved
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45549:3"/>City?) Are they not many? Is not the Sea before and Mountaines on each ſide? And are not all hopes, beſides what ſtands in God, utterly gone? Oh! is it, Time now to Buy and Sell, to Plant and Build, and Marry and give in Marriage in the worldly Part, Care and Deſire. Give up, Give up, Let not your Hearts dwell contracted to the Old Man.</p>
            <p>Ariſe, <hi>Come forth and meet the Bridegroom,</hi> that you may feel and behold his ſtrength, who is able to ſubject all things unto himſelfe, and ſubdue all things under you; Feel that love that is ſtronger than Death, and Crueller than the Grave; then I know your Hearts will not fail you in this Day of Tryal, neither ſhall fear ſeize upon your Spirits.</p>
            <p>O Lambs, feed upon your Paſture; and ye Virgins, dwell in your proper Habitations, that your reſt may be in the Hope of Glory; For great is the Peace of <hi>Sions</hi> Flock; (Notwithſtanding Tribulation in the World,) With You I have a Portion, with which I am content, and truly willing to do the will of my God, and your God, whoſe bleſſed preſence fills all our Hearts; the Streams of his love flow unto (and into) us, to the glading of all the City, although it be Beſieged, and the Camp be very great, and the Bullwark ſtrong, and their Hopes flouriſhing round about it; yet the ſhout of a King is in the middeſt of it, ſtrong are our Arms, polliſhed are our Arrows, skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full are our Archers, and full of courage are our Men of War, whoſe Weapons are not Carnall, but Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, and Mighty againſt the Beaſt and falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.</p>
            <p>O now let us wait to injoy his preſence; Wait for Milk ye Babes; March on in the Word of Patience
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45549:3"/>ye Young Men; Sit upon the Thrones ye Ancients, in the Houſe and Family of God; Retain your judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Righteouſneſs; wax full in Councel; ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the weak; Threſh not without skill; bruiſe not the Seed; Plow light Furrows; Oppreſſe not the Yoaked; Carry in your Arms; uſe Diligence ye o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to pour out your Oyl, that the fatneſs of the Houſe may refreſh them that are ready to faint, that the Family may be Gladed; Cheriſh one another; Keep in the fellowſhip of Light and Life. Tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Remnant, gather your ſelves together, ſit down in the Spirit of Supplication; be not daunted; walk not as caſt down and forſaken; Let not the Serpent ſee the Appearance of complaining in you: The Night will over, The Storm will vaniſh, (take not your flight in this Winter,) the Sun appears through this Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt; Joy is approaching, and Truth ſhall ſing in the Nations over deceipt: And thoſe that overcome ſhall be filled with Triumphant praiſes for ever: Oh! let me prevail, let my Cry come to the Cryer in you, for Valour and Courage in the Patience and Faith of Saints; for yet a little while, and the <hi>Aſſirians</hi> ſhall flie, and the Walls of their Cities ſhall fall, and great ſhall be their fall; yet a little while, and ye ſhall Rejoyce over her, ye Holy Prophets and Apoſtles, ye ſhall Rejoyce over her that was ſtrongly builded with Blood and with Iniquity; yet a little while and the Inſtruments of Muſick ſhall not be heard in Her, nor any Crafts-Man or Merchant Rejoycing in Her: Nay, the voyce of the Bridgroom, and of the Bride, ſhall be heard no more at all in Her, they ſhall be Redeemed out of Her, and ſhall not partake of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45549:4"/>her Plagues; even the Bridegroom &amp; the Bride ſhall Rejoyce together without the Walls of that City, and great ſhall be the Joy of the Nations, and Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſhall be the Crown of Life, and Honourable the Scepter of Righteouſneſs throughout the World.</p>
            <p>Therefore dear Family of God, let not in the Reaſon of Fleſh and Blood leaſt thy Beauty be Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and thy Beautiful Garment Spotted, and thy Glory Defaced; Oh! thou Daughter of <hi>Zion;</hi> Oh! keep thy Eſpouſal, Defile not thy Bed, neither for Fear, nor Love; be ſingle-Hearted, the Lord is with thee of a Truth; What! hath he Led thee, and Fenced thee, and broken the Teeth of the Lyons, and hurled the Pot-ſherds on heaps, and bound up all Fallen Wiſdom as in a Faggot, and burned it as Droſs before thee, and will he now leave thee for a prey to the Spoyler? What! will the Shepherd leave his Lambs incamped with Wolves? or, will a Father leave his Children crying in the Mire? ſhall they cry for Bread, and Help, and will he ſhut his Bowells, and turn his Back, and leave them to the Mercyleſſe, even to the Devouring Furnace of the Wicked? I tell you nay; but our God will eaſe him of his Enemies, and avenge him of his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, and certainly ſave to the uttermoſt, thoſe that endure to the End, and will ſet them in the Honourable places, to Reign in his Truth over all: Oh! bleſſed are the Simple, whoſe hearts are upright, whoſe mindes are not clogged with Wiſdome from below, in which the Senſual Reaſon ſtandeth, that darkeneth the Eye of the minde, and leadeth to ſtrike hands with Deceit; for ſuch as joyn with
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45549:4"/>Deceit ſhall be aſhamed, when as the Faithful through Tryal come forth purer than Gold; then ſhall the Fig-leafe Garment not Hide; nay, the Bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles that hath caught them ſhall not ſhelter them that ſeek to fly the Croſs: Up, Ariſe, put on Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, ſtand ſingly, let the Heathen do what they will, ſo far as their will is permitted, let them fill up the Meaſure of their Fathers, and ye muſt fill up the meaſure of your Fathers: Remember with what you are Intruſted; delay not Improvement; the work is not hard to the Diligent, to the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Minded, but to the sluggard; and Raggs ſhall not cloath him, ſo as to cover him from the Wrath of the Lamb, nor ſhall that Garment be admitted to enter, ſo as to dwell in the Brides Chamber.</p>
            <p>I am filled, ſuffer me I pray you, to in treat you, (though you know it) let every one dwell in the Nobilitie of the Truth, which is not afraid of the ſons of men, neither Diſmaid at their Revilings. Lie down, lie down, let <hi>Sion</hi> be plowed like a Field, let <hi>Haman</hi> boaſt a ſeaſon, let him build his Gallows; Reſt ye in the hope of your Glory, and wait you upon him who is Mighty, upon whom help is laid; Fear not the Wrath of man: I ſay, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in that love that caſteth it out, and brings into the Confidence, that nothing is able to ſeparate from. Oh! let not things preſent, nor things to come, ſeparate any one of you that make mention of his Name; but dwell together in Unitie with the Lord, and one with another; and the God of peace be with your ſpirits, <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thou Mighty God of Power, give Patience to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:45549:5"/>thy Wormes to Endure, Lead them, Preſerve them, Encourage them that lye at thy Foot-ſtool; Raiſe them up, Fight their Battle, Plead their Cauſe, Speak Comfortably to thy People, ſhew thy Preſence to thy Afflicted; Remove the Yoak of Oppreſſion, when it is thy will; and until then, and for ever, we reſt in Hope, Waiting and Crying in the Breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of thy Life, untill thy  <hi>Sion</hi>  be made the Glory of the whole Earth; thy Will be done, into which Lord God Receive our Spirits, and in it bundle up our Life and Love, even in the Fellowſhip of thy Light, Grace and Spirit,  <hi>Amen.</hi>
