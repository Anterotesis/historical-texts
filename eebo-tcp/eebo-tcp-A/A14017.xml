            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>efe delights,</l>
            <l>Were firſt deuiſde to daunt the dumps of penſiue pained ſprights.</l>
            <l>To cleare the clowds of drowping cares, &amp; miſts of mournfull mind,</l>
            <l>And baniſh bale that heauie harts in cheereleſſe chaines did bind.</l>
            <l>And more than that, to further health, by moouing too and fro,</l>
            <l>That in our lumpiſh lustleſſe limmes, no dire diſeaſe might grow:</l>
            <l>Which otherwiſe (ſet ſport aſide, and ſweet delightfull glee)</l>
            <l>In idle bodies breeds of force, as we by proofe do ſee,</l>
            <l>Not much vnlike the ſtanding lakes, in durtie dampiſh grounds,</l>
            <l>Where water hath no power to paſſe, moſt noyſome filth abounds.</l>
            <l>If games were thus found out at first, for mind and bodies eaſe,</l>
            <l>Aſwell to quite that one of griefes, as th'other of diſeaſe:</l>
            <l>Why then? of force it follow muſt, that thoſe delights are chiefe,</l>
            <l>And most to be imbraſt, that lend to either part reliefe,</l>
            <l>Which if be ſo, I need not bluſh, or deeme it my diſgrace,</l>
            <l>If Hawks and Spanels I preferre, and ſet in highest place.</l>
            <l>For truely no deuiſe delights, the mind of man ſo much,</l>
            <l>No game ſo gladſome to the limmes, there is no pleaſure ſuch.</l>
            <l>No Phiſicke fitter to remooue the dregs of direfull paine,</l>
            <l>And to reſtore to former life, the feeble force againe.</l>
            <l>Of Spanels firſt I meane to ſpeake, for they begin the glee,</l>
            <l>Who being once vncoupled, when they feele their collers free,</l>
            <l>In royſting wiſe about they range, with cheerefull chappes to ground,</l>
            <l>To ſee where in the champion may ſome lurking fowle be found.</l>
            <l>A sport to view them ſtirre their ſternes, in hunting too and fro,</l>
            <l>And to behold how nature doth her power in Spanels ſhow:</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:28166:4"/>Who ſcoure the fields with wondrous skill, and deale in cunning ſort,</l>
            <l>As though indeed they had conſpirde, to make their maſter ſport.</l>
            <l>What merrier muſicke can you craue? what note but halfe ſo good?</l>
            <l>As when the Spaniels croſſe the runne, of Peaſants in the wood?</l>
            <l>Or light vpon the little Poutes, where they haue lately beene?</l>
            <l>Aſſuredlie no better glee, is either heard or ſeene.</l>
            <l>So as by Hawkes doth pleaſure grow, vnto the gazing eie,</l>
            <l>And dogges delight the liſtning eares, before the hawkes do flie.</l>
            <l>What dolt ſo dull but takes delight, when once the Spaniell ſprings</l>
            <l>The fearefull fowle, and when the hawke lyes long vpon her wings?</l>
            <l>What ſence ſo ſad, what mind ſo mazde, but ſets his ſorrowes by,</l>
            <l>What once the Falcon free begins, to ſend amid the skie?</l>
            <l>To turne and winde a bird by ſleight, and eke at laſt to ſlay</l>
            <l>With ſtrong encounter, doues, and duckes, and euery other pray?</l>
            <l>The prettie Partridge, Railes, and Quailes, that haunt the open field?</l>
            <l>And from her mountay to enforce the Hearon haught to yeeld?</l>
            <l>By binding with her cloſe in cloudes, in manner out of ſight?</l>
            <l>For noble Peeres and chiefest States, a paſſing pleaſant flight?</l>
            <l>So ſmall a bird, ſo large a fowle, at ſuch a loftie gate,</l>
            <l>To reach and rappe, and force to fall, it is a game of ſtate.</l>
            <l>No fellow to the flight at Brooke, that game is full of glee,</l>
            <l>It is a ſport the ſtowping of aroyſting Hawke to ſee.</l>
            <l>And if ſhee miſſe, to marke her how ſhe then gets vp amaine,</l>
            <l>For best advantage, to eneaw the ſpringing fowle againe.</l>
            <l>Who if be landed as it ought, then is it ſure to die.</l>
            <l>Or if ſhe ſlippe, a ioy to ſee, the Hawke at randon flie,</l>
            <l>And ſo for head to ſlay the fowle, a noble ſport to view,</l>
            <l>In my conceit no pleaſure like to Hawkes, I tell you true.</l>
            <l>It ſets the ſences all to worke, there may none idle be,</l>
            <l>The tong it lures, the legs they leape, the eie beholds the glee:</l>
            <l>The eares are buſied eke to heare, the calling Spanels queſt,</l>
            <l>Do tell me then what ſence it is, that reſpite hath to reſt?</l>
            <l>And more than that the bart it leaps, and laughes for ioy to thinke,</l>
            <l>How ſuch a ſlender hawke ſhould cauſe, ſo huge a fowle to ſhrink.</l>
            <l>This kind of ſport doth baniſh vice, and vile deviſes quight,</l>
            <l>When other games do foster faults, and breed but baſe delight.</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:28166:4"/>No idle thought can harbor well within the Falconers braine,</l>
            <l>For though his ſports right pleaſant be, yet are they mixt with pain.</l>
            <l>The toyle he takes to find the fowle, his greedy luſt to ſlay,</l>
            <l>The fowle once found cuts off co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceits, &amp; driues ill thoughts away.</l>
            <l>He lures, he leapes, he calls, he cries, he ioyes, he waxeth ſad,</l>
            <l>And frames his moode, according as his hawke doth well or bad.</l>
            <l>Dame Venus harbors not in holtes, no Cupid haunts the hilles,</l>
            <l>Diana dwelles in open place, with bow her game ſhe kils.</l>
            <l>In woodes no wanton Goddeſſe woones: in Citie ſoiournes ſinne,</l>
            <l>There vice in vawts &amp; dungeon dwells, the lecher lurks within.</l>
            <l>Dianas traine doth loue the launds, they long abrode to rome,</l>
            <l>But bawdie <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enus ympes embrace, the loitring life at home.</l>
            <l>To dice, to daunce, to coll, to kiſſe, to carde the time away,</l>
            <l>To prate, to prancke, to bowle, to bowſe, and tipple out the day.</l>
            <l>To checke at Cheſſe, to heaue at Maw, at Macke to paſſe the time,</l>

This Hawke whome I terme a Matagaſſe, after the French, is in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Italian tongue called <hi>Regoſtola Falcone a,</hi> and among the Germains <hi>Thornkretzer,</hi> a Hawke not in vſe with vs, &amp; in truth of ſlender regard &amp; eſtimation in nature. Yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, both to follow mine Author, and to make my diuiſion perfect, I hold it néedfull to reckon that kind of Hawke among the reſt: and in the latter end of the firſt part of this treatiſe, I will briefly deſcribe you his nature, which is no leſſe baſe than ſtrange. You muſt note, that all theſe kind of hawkes,<note place="margin">Addition.</note> haue their male birdes and cockes of euery ſort and gender, [As y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Eagle his Earne, the Mylion his Tercell. the Gerfalcon his Ierkin, the Falcon his Tiercel gentle, the Merlin his Iacke, the Hobby his Robin, the Goſhawke his Tiercell, &amp; the Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowhawk his Muſket.] And further, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> female of al birds of prey &amp; rauine, is euermore huge than the male, more ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous, hardy, and watchfull, but of ſuch birdes as doe not liue by rauine and prey, the male is more large than the female.</p>

And this ſort of Hawkes do neuer vſe to plume or the vypon the fowle whom they haue ſeazed, vntil ſuch time as they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it to leaue buſking and bating in the foote: of which kind and qualytie are,

               <p>Now that other ſort which I ſpeake of, doe ſlay their prey and game by maine force of wing, at randon &amp; before heade, not ſtouping at all from their wings, as the other Hawkes do, whome I made mention of before. And thiefe Hawkes haue their chefe force and ſtrength in the foote, and not in the ieake, and therefore no ſooner doe ſeaze vpon the prey, but preſentlie they giue themſelues to plume and tire thereon Of this ſort are,

               <p>For all Hawkes and birds of prey, doe not ſerue the Falco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners vſe, but only ſuch as are hardy, and frée of mettle, able to flye the field and riuer. And therefore thoſe onely kinds ſhall be the iniect of my booke, and not thoſe baſe, baſterdly refuſe Hawkes, which are ſomewhat in name, and nothing in déede.</p>
               <p>As the Gréekes would, that <hi>Hierax,</hi> &amp; the Latines that <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipiter,</hi> which is a ſpecial terme to one hawke and bird of prey, ſhould giue the generall name and title to all Hawkes, and birds of prey, becauſe of his excellency: So in like manner, the Frenchmen of our age, haue ordayned that the Falcon, which is a tearme peculier and proper to one kinde of birde of prey, ſhal giue generall name and appellation to all Hawkes, &amp; birds of prey whatſoeuer they bée, becauſe the Falcon doth paſſe all other hawkes in boldnes and curteſie, and is moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar to man, of all other birds of prey. And thereof it procée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth that we ſay, the Falcon Gentle, the Haggard Falcon, the Falcon Sacre, and ſo likewiſe of the other Hawkes, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them all by the name of Falcon.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, as the Falcon, which is a ſpeciall name of one kind of Hawkes, hath giuen name to all other Hawks &amp; birds of prey: So hath it beſtowed the name and title of a Falconer, to euery one of what ſtate or calling ſoeuer hée bée, that doth deale with any kind of Hawkes and the terme of Falconrie, to the art, profeſſion, and knowledge of luring and manning thoſe birds of prey, by which ſingular ſkill, they are made to flée all other fowles, as well thoſe fowles of the ayre, as of the land and riuer. Which in my conceit, deſerueth no ſlender commendation and praiſe, being a matter almoſt quite againſt the lawes of nature and kind, for one fowle ſo artiffcially to vndertake, and ſo cruelly to murther another, and hauing at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieued his enterpriſe, with gréedy &amp; willing mind, to repaire to man againe, hauing the whole ſcope of the heauens, and the circuite of the earth at their pleaſure to range and peruſe: &amp; to

yéeld themſelues in ſuch franke manner to the priſon, &amp; cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of man, being by kind ſet free, and at liberty to prey, and diſpoſe themſelues. Such and ſo great is the ſingular ſkill of man, when by art he is reſolued to alter the preſcribed order of nature, which by induſtry and paine wée ſée is brought to paſſe and effect.</p>

               <p>THe browne or yeallow Eagle after <hi>Aristotles</hi> opinion, is called in gréek <hi>Guyſeon,</hi> which doth ſignifie in the French tong (kindly &amp; no baſtard born) becaus it is of al other kinds of eagles, the true &amp; right eagle, &amp; he doth cal him by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gréek word <hi>Chryſaitos,</hi> by reaſon of his golde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mayle, &amp; in latin he is termed
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:28166:9"/>
                  <hi>Stellaris,</hi> and <hi>Herodus.</hi> This is that Eagle, whome we call the Eagle royall, king of birds, and ſometimes the bird of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and that Eagle which ought to bee taken and accounted the principall beſt, being more huge and large then the reſt, and beſides more rare &amp; dainty to be ſéene. For ſhe doth haunt moſt commonly the toppes of high and craggie mountatnes, and doth there prey vpon all ſorts of fowles, as alſo Hares, kidds, Goats, &amp; ſuch other like wild and ſauage beaſts of the field.</p>
               <p>This Eagle doth liue alwayes ſolitary and alone, vnleſſe happily ſhe hath her broode with her, whome ſhe doth conduct and guide from place to place, the better to inſtruct them how to kill their prey, and féed themſelues. But no ſooner hath ſhée made them perfect, &amp; throughly ſcoled them therein, but preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhe chaſeth them out of that coaſt, &amp; doth abandon them the place where they were eyred, and will in no wiſe brooke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to abide néere her, to the end, that the country where ſhe diſclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth and maketh her eyrie, be not vnfurniſhed of conuenient prey, which by the number &amp; exceſſiue ſtore of Eagles, might otherwiſe be ſpoyled and made bare. For it is very likely, that if her brood and increace ſhould there make ſtay, being ſo huge birds, and of ſo great rauine, there would in ſhort ſpace lacke prey for her ſelfe, and by meane thereof bréede her to a father euill and miſchiefe: for the auoyding of which, this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident and carefull fowle doth preſently force her brood to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part into ſome other part and Region.</p>
               <p>This Eagle may with eaſe be diſcerned from the Vulture, becauſe this Eagle Royall, being browne, or yellow maylde, hath not her arms or féet in any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition couered with plume, as the Vulture hath.</p>
               <p>True it is, that the arme of the Eagle is ſhort, yellow mayld &amp; all beſet with ſcales, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pounces large, her beake blacke, long, and crooked at the top. The traine of the Eagle Royall, as alſo the traine of the ſlender blacke Eagle is ſhort and ſtife at the poynt, euen as the traine of the Vulture is.</p>
               <p>The Eagle is alwayes of oneſelfe hugeneſſe, in reſpect of her nature, and it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be ſaid, in that ſhe is an Eagle, that ſhe is
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:28166:9"/>
eyther larger or leſſer, at any one time or other, vnleſſe you giue her the ſurname and addition of blacke, yellow, or ſome other ſuch proper name and tesme, which doth alter her accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to her accidents, but nothing at all in regard of her ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and nature. And were it not that ſhe is ſo maſſy a fowl and not portable on the fiſt, (as in troth ſhe is exceding huge) and beſides, it is ſo hard and difficult a matter to prouide her prey and food, Princes &amp; puiſſant States, would more vſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haue her, and hawke with her for their ſolace and pleaſure, than they now do. But by reaſon ſhe is ſo hugh and ventrous, ſhe might happily offer force and violence to the eyes and face of her kéeper, if at any time ſhe ſhould conceiue diſpleaſure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. And for this cauſe cheiflie, the Eagle is not in vſe, as other meaner howkes, and of leſſe force be in theſe days.</p>
               <p>Hée that will haue the Eagle to be good and tractable, muſt deuiſe to take her an Eyeſſe in the Eirie, ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning and accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming her among houndes and greyhoundes, to the end that when hée goeth and addreſſeth him to the field, the Eagle ſoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring aloft ouer the hounds ſtarting the game, Fox, Hare, gote or ſuch like beaſts of the wood, ſhe making her downe-come, &amp; ſtooping from her wings, may ſo ſtay, &amp; ſeaze vopn the game, vntil the dogs come in, and procure the fall thereof. A man may féed her with any kind of fleſh, and chiefly of ſuch game and prey, as ſhée ſlayeth in the field by flight.</p>
               <p>Tawnye or browne mayle in an Eagle, déepe and hallow eyes, ſpecially if ſhe bée bread in the weſt parts of the whrld, is an aſſured ſigne of her goodneſſe: for the tawnie Eeale is euer found good in proofe.</p>
               <p>Alſo the whitenes on the head of an Eagle, or on her backe, is a ſingular token of an excellent Eagle.</p>
               <p>That Eagle, that when ſhée fleeth from the fiſt of her kéeper, wil eyther flée vpon the man, ſoaring round about him, or light on the ground, and take the ſtand, is by all probability &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectture, no inward Eagle, but a fugitiue, and a rangler.</p>
               <p>At what time the Eagle diſplayes her traine in her flight, &amp; makes a turne in her mounty, it is a very great ſigne that ſhée
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:28166:10"/>
determineth to flye on head, and gadde: the next remedy for which miſchiefe, is to throw her out her meat, &amp; lure her with as loude a voyce as you poſſible may. And if it be ſo, that ſhée then ſtoope not to that which is caſt out vnto her, then eyther hath ſhe ouer gorged her ſelfe, or otherwiſe ſhée is too hie, &amp; too full of fleſh. A meane to auoide this inconuenience, is to ſowe the feathers of her train together, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end ſhe may not ſpread them abroad, nor vſe the benefite of her traine feathers in her flight. Or elſe another way is, to deplume and make bare her tuell and fundament ſo as it may appeare, and then certainly for feare of the colde ayre ſhe will not aduenture to mount ſo hie: but féeling her traine feathers faſt ſowed together, ſhe wil ſtand in awe of other Eagles, whome by the meane of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice and practiſe, ſhe ſhall in no wiſe be able to avoide.</p>
               <p>When the Eagle maketh a ſhort turne vpon her kéeper in her flight, &amp; flieth not out aforehead, that is one principall good token that ſhe will not away.</p>
               <p>It hath béen ſayd, that an Eagle is of force to arreſt, and cauſe a Wolfe to ſtay, and will take him, with the aid and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of doggs, making in to her reſcue, and that it hath béen ſéene and experimented. But for my part I finde the oddes of them ſo great, as I leaue the beleife of it to the Reader, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing it as a troth, but a thing written to ſhew the great har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe and vndaunted nature of the Eagle.</p>
               <p>It is reported that the men of the country where the Eagle eyreth, knowing thereof, and intending to bereaue her young broode, doe arme and well furniſh their heads, for feare leaſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Eagle do offer them force and violence. And if ſo they ſhew the old bréeder one of her chickens, or tie it to the bough of a trée neare the place where ſhée buildeth, ſhe will call and cauſe the damme to repaire thither by continuall cleping, who findeth her, and pitying her cries, will bring it ſo much prouiſion and prey, as he that commeth to take her from the eyrie, ſhal there dayly be ſped of as much fleſh and prouiſion as will very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably ſerue him and ſixe others. For the old Eagle will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey thither hares, Conies, fowles, and ſuch other like vittel, &amp;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:28166:10"/>
viands, for the ſupply of her neceſſity.</p>
               <p>The Eagle doth not commonly vſe to prey nere vnto her eyrie, but to kill her prouiſion abroad as farre off as ſhée may. And if ſo it happen, ſhée leaue any fleſh after ſhee is full gorged, that doth ſhe reſerue carefully for the next day, to the end that if foule weather ſhould happily grow to hinder her flight, yet ſhe might be ſtored of ſufficient prey for the day following, without any further trauell.</p>
               <p>An Eagle doth not forſake or change her Eyrie all her life time, but of cuſtome doth yearely returne, and make repayre to one ſelfe place, and there buildeth moſt aſſuredly, by meane whereof it hath béen noted and obſerued in times paſt, that an Eagle doth liue very many yeares. Before her old age, her beake waxeth ſo exceding long and crooked at the topp, as ſhée is much hindered thereby of her féeding: in ſort, as ſhée dyeth not of diſeaſe, or by extremity of age, but onely by reaſon ſhée cannot poſſiblie vſe the benefite of her beake, being accrewd &amp; growne to ſuch an exceding length and diſproportion. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of commeth the Prouerbe be as I take it, <hi>Aquila ſenectus,</hi> the age of an Eagle, which is properly applyed to men that doe liue onely by drinke, as old men are wont to doe.</p>
               <p>The Eagle doth euer wage warre with the little Roytelet, whome the French men doe ſo tearme, for that this fowle is thought to be a little king among birds, as the Etimologie of the worde doth ſéeme to import, the Latines likewiſe they call him <hi>Regulus,</hi> and the Germanes a Golden line.

               <p>THere are two ſorts of Eagles, that is to ſay, the huge and royall Eagle, which is the Haggart or paſſenger. And a leſſe Eagle, which is a baſe and baſtard Eagle, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:28166:16"/>The right Eagle is bredde in the higheſt clyues of the Leuant, and ſpecially in thoſe of Ciprus. They are as large as a wild Gooſe, and more. Some of them are of a browne mayle, and ſome other of a ſpotted mayle, their gorges and breaſtes are full of ſtraked lynes, tending to redde, they haue long heades, great beakes, and very much crookt, ſtrong armes and rough large ſtretchers, in a manner as great as the palme of a mans hand, boyſtrous talons, and a reaſonable long trayne.</p>
               <p>Theſe Eagles, in the mayne fielde will take the Hare, and by force hold him, and carrye him in the ayre, as they flée, vntill they eſpie ſome rocke or other fit ſtand, where they may prey vpon him. In like ſort they take other beaſtes, and ſundry times doe roue and raunge abroad to beat &amp; ſeaze on Goates, kiddes, and Fawnes. They are in vſe, and price with ſundry noble men, as hath béene reported vnto mée credibly.</p>
               <p>The great Turke of all other Princes, doth moſt vſe to flée with the Eagle, and doth giue his Falconers in charge to man and lure them, as they doe the Goſhawke: and being throughly manned, hath a caſt of Eagles at one time, vpon one pearch: betwixt twoo of his people into the field, when they are there, they flée both together, the one at the mown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tée, a very ſtately pitch, and the other more baſe and low, and that Eagle that doth flye the baſe pitch, is taught to make a great noyſe as ſhée roueth too and fro ouer the Forreſt, not much vnlike the queſting or calling of a dogge, by meane of which ſodayne cry and noyſe, diuers times there iſſue out of the couert, ſome wilde and ſauage Beaſtes, which are no ſooner diſcried by that high fléeing Eagle, but ſodainly ſhée bateth of her pitch, and ſtoopeth from her wings, &amp; at the down-come eyther ſeazeth or rifleth ſome one of them, ſlaying them by force, vntill the dogges may make in to her reſkew. And thus betwixt the Eagle and curres, the prey

You may geſſe of the excellency of this gallant Paſtime, if it be true, as it is vouched by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.

And my reaſon is this, that ſhée ſhould be better able to endure cold then the Falcon Gentle, becauſe ſhée doth come from forraine parts a ſtraunger, and a paſſenger, and doth winne all her prey and meat at the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt by maine wing, and doth arriue in thoſe parts, where ſhée is taken when the fowles doe come in great flockes, which is the very hardeſt part of the yeare. Moreouer being a hote Hawke by kind, ſhée ſhould the better ſuſtaine the force of weather, and that ſhée is a hote Hawke of nature, may bée gathered by her flying ſo high a pitch, which I take to be, for that in the higher partes, ſhée findeth the colder ayre, for the middle region is more cold then the reſt, becauſe thether com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth no reflexion.

               <p>But before I ſpeake of the Falcon Gentle, I will ſomwhat touch the Etimologie of the name, and lay down the opinons of two learned men, and ancient writers, as touching that matter.</p>
               <p>Firſt <hi>Suidas</hi> a Gréeke Author doth affirme, that <hi>Falco</hi> which in our mother ſpéech doth import a Falcon, is a generall name to all Hawkes of prey and rauine, as <hi>Accipiter</hi> is in Latine, and <hi>Hierax</hi> in Gréeke.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Feſtus,</hi> he is of opinion, that the Falcon is ſo named, becauſe of her pounces, and crooked talons, which do bend like vnto a ſith or ſickle, which in Latine is called <hi>Falx.</hi>

               <p>But wherehence ſoeuer the name is deriued, this is moſt aſſured, that of all other birds of prey, the Falcon is moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, and the very Prince of all other Hawkes, both for her goodneſſe of wing, and great hardineſſe and courage.</p>

               <p>THe Falcon gentle, by nature doth loue to flée the Hearon euery way, &amp; is a very good Hearoner, as well from her

wings at the down-come, as from the fiſt, and aforehead, and will flée all other kinds of greater fowles, as thoſe which are tearmed birds of Paradiſe, fowles more large then the Hearo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

               <p>IF a man doe well, he ſhould neuer take the Falcons out of the Eyrie, till time they be fully ſummed &amp; hard penned, or if hée do happely commit that errour, hée ſhould not man her, but preſently cauſe her to be conueighed and placed in an Ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie that moſt doth reſemble the Eyrie of a Hawke, if hée may conueniently come by any ſuch, and there bréed her, and feede her with good fleſh, ſuch as the fleſh of Pullets, Chickens, Pigeons, and ſuch like, for otherwiſe her wings will not grow to any perfection, and her legs and other parts would quicklie be broken &amp; waxe crooked, and her traine feathers, and for the moſt part, all her long feathers and flags be full of taints.</p>

               <head>The good ſhape of a Falcon.</head>
               <p>THat you may the better make choyce of your Falcon, and know a good Falcon from a refuſe, I will diſcribe you the perfect ſhape of a right good Falcon, ſuch a one as is very like to bée good, though many times wée ſée, that in proofe, the moſt likely things to ſhew, and to the eye, becom in proofe, the worſt and of leaſt regard.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:28166:20"/>The ſhape of a good Falcon therefore is, firſt to haue wide nares, high and large eye-liddes, a great blacke eye, a round head, ſome what full on the toppe, a ſhort thicke beake, blew as azure, a reaſonable high necke, barbe feathers vnder the clappe of the beake, a good large breaſt, round, fleſhly, ſtrong, hard and ſtiffe bonded And that is the true cauſe, why the Falcon doth greatly affie in her breaſt, and ſtriketh with it, and gageth it moſt at her encounter. And by meane ſhée is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtrong armed, ſhée vſeth the more fréely alſo to ſtrike a foule with her pounces and talons. Moreouer ſhée muſt be broade ſhouldred, ſhée muſt haue ſlender ſayles, full ſides, long and great thighes, ſhée muſt be ſtrong and ſhort armed, large foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, with the ſeare of the foot ſoft, and all one for hew with the ſeare of the beake and nares, blacke pownces, long wings and croſſing the traine, which traine ought to be ſhort, and apt to bend and bow to euery ſide. For in the traine of a Hawke doth conſiſt a great helpe, when ſhée flyeth. And therefore (as well as for beautie) if a traine feather or couert feather be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken or bruiſed, we doe couet to ympe them againe, or ſet them to right, becauſe it may be the leſſe hinderance to the hawke in her flight.</p>
               <p>You muſt note that thoſe very Falcons, that are of one kinde and ſort, haue very great difference and odds betwixt them, and are called by diuers names, according to the time that a man beginneth to deale with them, and doth vndertake them, according to the places where they haunt, and according to the Countries whence they come.</p>
               <p>They are diuided into mewed Hakes, Rammage hawkes, Sore-hawkes, and Eyeſſes, into large Hawkes, meane hawkes, and ſlender hawes, all which are of diuers and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall plumes and mayles, according to the diuerſitie of the regions. Alſo they are of diuers prices, according to the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and eſtimation of them. Againe, ſome are blacke Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, ſome ruſſet Falcons, ſome other blanck Falcons: ſome of which are riuer Hawkes, to ſlay the fowle at the brooke, and other ſome field hawkes, to flye the land, and there to

kill the Feſant, Partridge, and ſuch like fowles. Thus you ſée how diuers and many they be, according to their outwarde accidents, and yet in nature, all Falcons. Therefore becauſe I am to treate of euery kind ſeuerall, I will not longer holde you in this place, with deſcription of the Falcon Gentle: but hereafter when I write in another place of the diſeaſes, cures and the manning of theſe hawkes, I will as neare as I may, let paſſe nothing that ſhall belong in any reſpect vnto the Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, but that in one place or other you ſhall finde it.</p>

               <p>THe firſt name and tearme that they beſtow on a Falcon, is an Eyeſſe, and this name doth laſt as long as ſhée is in the Eyrie, and for that ſhée is taken from the Eyrie.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Falcons are tedious, and doe vſe to crie very much, in their féeding they are troubleſone and painefull to bée en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred: but being once well entred and quarred, they leaue a great part of that vice, and doe proue very good to the Hearon, and to the riuer: and all other kinds of fowle they are hardy, and naturally full of good mettle.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The ſecond name is a ramage Falcon, and ſo ſhée is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led when ſhee hath departed and left the Eyrie, that name doth laſt, and ſhée is called a ramage Hawke, May, Iune, Iuly, and Auguſt. Theſe Falcons are hard to bée manned by reaſon of the heat, and for that they can ill brooke hunger, or to ſtand emptie panneld: but who ſo can vſe them with patience and iudgement, ſhall find them paſſing good, for that they are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fault.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Thirdly they are called ſore Hawkes, from the end of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt, to the laſt of September, October, and Nouember.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Hawks are of good diſpoſition, they will doe verie well, and are in their prime, and full pride for beautie and goodneſſe. Neuertheleſſe thoſe firſt plumes that they haue, when they forſake the Eyrie, thoſe doe they keepe one whole

yeare before they caſt or mew them, and that kind of feather, is called the Sore-feather. According to the diuerſitie of theſe tearmes and times, theſe Hawkes doe become better and better to be manned and kept.</p>
               <p n="4">4 The fourth ſpéech and tearme that is beſtowed on them, (as my Italian Author doth call them) is, that they are tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Marzaroly,</hi> and ſo are they called from Ianuary, Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, March, Aprill, vntill the middeſt of May. I haue no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Engliſh phraſe for them, but they are very tedious and painefull, and the reaſon is, for that they muſt bée kept on the fiſt all that ſpace. Diuers of them are great baters, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not very gréedy of meate or hungrie, they are but badde Hawkes, much ſubiect to Filanders and the wormes, who lookes to winne credit or good by kéeping them, muſt be of good experience, and no leſſe patience.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Fiftly, they are called (Entermewers) or Hawkes of the firſt coate, that is, from the middle of May till Iune, Iuly, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt, September, October, Nouember, December.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Hawkes are called Entermewers, for that they caſt the old, and haue new feathers, and they prooue very good, and hardy Hawkes, but no great truſt is to be giuen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for that they are giddy headed and fickle: wherefore he that lookes to haue good, or credit by kéeping of them, muſt be very circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and regard their natures very well, and muſt kéepe a good hard hand on them, and muſt make his fiſt their pearch, &amp; neuer in a maner let them be from the fiſt. [And thus v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,<note place="margin">Addition.</note> they are in that yeare the higheſt flyers, &amp; moſt apt for the riuer.]</p>
               <p>Beſides in thoſe ſeuen kindes of Falcons, which I ſpake of in the firſt diuiſion, there are included ſondry ſortes tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med according to the Countries and places where they are eyried, and whence they come: the ſpeciall names and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of all which, I hold it not ſo néedfull to diſcourſe vpon, ſpeaking fully &amp; ſufficiently of thoſe ſeuen kinds of Falcons in their times and places, as they ſhall offer themſelues in order vnto mée to bée decyphered vnto the Reader, to whoſe good

               <p n="2">2 The ſecond cauſe is, becauſe theſe Falcons do rangle and wander more than any other ſort of Falcons are wont to doe, ſéeking out more ſtrange and vncouth countries, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede may giue them that title of Haggart &amp; peregrine hawks for theyr excellency, becauſe they do ſéeke ſomany ſtrange &amp; forraine coaſts, and do rangle ſo farr abroad.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The Third and laſt cauſe, I doe thinke, may be their beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and excellency, becauſe this word (<hi>Peregrino</hi>) or Peregrine, doth many times import an honourable &amp; choice matter had in great regard: but it ſkilleth not much which of theſe thrée alleadged is the true cauſe, wée will not ſtand vpon that nice point, for that a good Falconer ought much more to regard the ſcearching out of the true nature and property of Hawkes, then to haue ſo great and ſpeciall reſpect vnto their names, and tearmes.</p>
               <p>Wherefore I conclude, that theſe Haggart Falcons are not of Italie, but tranſported and brought thither from forraine places, as namely from Alexandria, Ciprus, and Candy. And yet this is for certaine, that in Italie there are taken of theſe Haggart Falcons, as in the dominion of the renowned Duke of Ferrara, &amp; in the countrie neare Rauenna, being brought thither by force of weather and wind. And by that meanes there are none of thoſe Haggarts found Eyeſſes, but they are al either ſoare Hawkes, or mewed Haggarts.</p>
               <p>Of ſhape and proportion they are like the other Falcons, &amp; are of thrée ſorts, as touching their making and mould, that is to ſay, large, little, or Falcons of a middle ſize. Some of them are long ſhapt, ſome ſhort truſſed Falcons, ſome larger, ſome leſſe.</p>
               <p>They are ordinarily of foure mayles, eyther blancke, ruſſet, browne, or turtle mayld, and ſome pure white maylde, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any iote or ſport of any other colour, but thoſe a man ſhall very ſeldome ſée. And for that cauſe I meane not to ſay much
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:28166:22"/>
of that kind of mayled Falcons, but will deale with ſuch as are more ordinarie in vſe.</p>

               <head>How to know a Haggart by her fleeing.</head>
               <p>A Good ſkilfull Falconer, will quickly diſcern a good Hag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gart Falcon, from a ſleight Falcon, though he be far off, by the ſtirring of her wings. For that a Haggart Falcon vſeth not a thick ſtroke, but ſtirreth her wing by leaſure and ſeldom, &amp; getteth vp to her mountée, without any great making out. And although perhaps ſhe be not ſo large as the fleight or ſoare Falcon, yet to ſéeming and ſhew, ſhe is more large, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth by meane of her ſayles, which in very déed are of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſcope and compaſſe than the fleight Falcons are. Contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the fleight Falcon ſhee vſeth a more ſhort and quicker ſtroke with her wing then the Haggart doth, &amp; doth not deale ſo leaſurely. There are beſids this one difference, ſondry other betwixt theſe two kinds of Falcons, which in this place I will deliuer you, for that you ſhall the better iudge the ods betwixt them, béeing both very good Falcons, and the beſt of all other, both for field, and riuer.</p>

               <head>The difference and ods betwixt the Haggart, and the Falcon Gentle.</head>
               <p>FOr that diuers haue delight to know the difference betwixt the Falcon Gentle and the Haggart, I will here ſhew you
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:28166:23"/>
certaine ſpeciall points concerning the difference of them both. Firſt the Haggart is a larger hawke then the Falcon gentle, and a longer armed Hawke, with a reaſonable large foot, and her talons more long then the Falcon Gentles are, a hie necke and a long, a fayre ſeaſoned head, and a more long beake then the other hath.</p>
               <p n="1">1 The beam feathers of the Haggart, as ſhée is in her ſlight, are longer then the Falcon gentles, her traine ſomewhat lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, the Haggart hath a flatte thigh, but the Falcon gentle a round thigh.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The Haggart will lie longer on her wings the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Falcon Gentle, and hath a more deliberate and leaſurely ſtroke then the other Falcon hath, as I ſayd before.</p>
               <p n="3">3 From the fiſt, it is reported by ſome, that the Falcon Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle doth flie more ſpéedily then the Haggart, but at a long flight the Haggart is farre the better of both, and doth exell all other kind of Hawkes both for good wing, and maintenance of her flight, which is a perfect proofe of a very good backe.</p>
               <p n="4">4 The Falcon Gentle is more haſty and hote in all her do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings then the Haggart, and is thought more raſh and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious of nature then the Haggart is. And when they flée to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, the Falcon Gentle will make her ſtooping and downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more vnaduiſedly, and will vſe the greater haſte to be at her pitch againe then the other, and miſſing the fowle at the ſtooping, the Falcon gentle is in the greater chafe, and will preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly flée on head at the check, ſo as many times ſhée is hard to come by againe. Whereas the Haggart is more deliberate &amp; better aduiſed, which procéedeth in my opinion, for that ſhée better knoweth the aduantage of her ſlight, than the Falcon gentle, becauſe ſhée hath béen forced often to prey for her ſelfe, &amp; hath not béen ſubiect to the order of any kéeper, neither hath had any hand kept vpon her, to make her eager &amp; gréedy of the prey, more then naturally ſhée is accuſtomed to flée at her ſeaſons to gorge her ſelfe, which ſhe doth both aduiſedly and to great aduantage.</p>
               <p n="5">5 The Haggart Falcon is taken in Candie, Rhodes, and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:28166:24"/>
many other places, of that Sea which is called <hi>Archipelagus,</hi> or the Aegean Sea.</p>
               <p n="6">6 The beſt ſort of thoſe Haggart Falcons, haue their beakes of the colour of azure.</p>
               <p n="7">7 Thoſe of Ciprus which are ſmall Hawks, and of a ruſſet mayle, they are the moſt hardy and ventrous Hawkes of all others.</p>
               <p>Much more might be ſaid, as touching the Haggart, and Falcon Gentle: but for that the Hawks are dayly in hand and view, and becauſe I haue a larger field to eare, which is to lay you downe the manning of them, and ſuch things as are more neceſſarie to a good Falconer, I leaue it, and will procéede to the next kind of Falcon, which is the Tartaret or Barbarie Falcon. As touching whoſe name and nature I meane to deliuer you, what I haue gathered as well out of the French Copie, as alſo borrowed from the Italian, whome I do much reuerence as well for his language, as for his rare and deepe deuiſe in al things wherein he hoth deale.</p>

They are very ventrous vpon all kind of fowles, and will flie at any game that the Haggart doth. With this Tartarot, or Barbary Falcon, and the Haggart alſo, you may flée all May and Iune, for they are Hawkes that are very ſlacke in mew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the firſt, but when they once beginne, they mew &amp; ſhedd their feathers very faſt.</p>

            <div type="section">
               <head>For what cauſe this Falcon is called a Barbary, or Tartaret Falcon.</head>
               <p>THeſe kind of Falcons are called Barbarie Falcons, for that moſt commonly they make their paſſage through Barbary and Tunyſe, where they are taken more often tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in any other place: As namely, in the Iſles of Leuant, Candy, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pres and Rhodes, where theſe Hawkes do more frequent and vſe, then in any other Region, and the country men will ſooner take them, by endeauour if they may, then any Hawkes that are eyréed in their Country. And truely I do not thinke, that in any other place, there are ſo many good Crane-ſlayers, as there are to be had in the Iſle of Candy. The reaſon of it is, for that the Nobility and ſtates of the Country, are much more enclined to kéepe thoſe kind of Hawks that will kil the Crane, then any other people are elſewhere, and they doe enure and make their Falcons to that kind of game, more than to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fowle. And ſurely you ſhall there haue excellent good Hawkes.</p>
               <p>Thus much it hath pleaſed mine Author to write of, and in commendation of the Barbarie Falcon: but here with vs in England, I neuer ſaw or heard of the proofe of thoſe hawkes, to be ſo good or excellent, as by his report I find them.

                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:28166:26"/>THe Gerfalcon is a bird of great force, a very fayre hawke, ſpecially being mewed, ſhe is ſtrong armed, ſhe hath large ſtretchers and ſingles, ſhe is fierce &amp; hardy of nature, by mean whereof ſhée is the more difficult and hard to be reclaymed. A Gerfalcon will looke to haue a gentle hand kept on her, and her keeper to be curteous and full of patience. The Gerfalcon is a gallant Hawke to behold, more huge then any other kind of Falcon, her eyes and her head are like the Haggart Falcon. She hath a great bending beak, large nares, a mayle like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Laner, very long ſayles, and ſharp pointed, a traine much like the Laner, a large foot, marble ſeared, blanck, ruſſet, and brown plumed as other Falcons be, more beutifully to the eye than any other kind of Falcon.</p>
               <p>Theſe kind of Hawkes are made to flée from the fiſt to the Heron, Crane, Gooſe, Buſtard, and ſuch other like fowles. When they are mewed, they doe very much reſemble the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, they doe not change the marble ſeare of the foot. Theyr Tiercels, (whome wée call Ierkyns) are had in great prize, they are brought from Leuant, Cipres, Candy, and Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria, by Marchants.</p>
               <p>The Gerfalcons by report, do moſt commonly Eyrée in the parts of Pruſſia, and vpon the borders of Ruſſia, and ſome of them come from the confines and mountaines of Norway. But moſt commonly they are taken about Almayne Paſſeby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es (as wée tearme them) or paſſengers.</p>
               <p>With the Gerfalcon, you may naturally flée all kinds of fowles, as I haue already written of the Haggart, and the Barbarie Falcon.</p>
               <p>Let it not diſcourage or amaze you, that the Gerfalcon is ſo hard to be reclaymed and manned, for the firceneſſe and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines of their nature, is the onely cauſe thereof, but in the end being once wonne, they proue excellent good Hawkes.</p>
               <p>They will ſit very vpright and ſtately on the fiſt. Theyr beakes are blew, and ſo are the ſeares of their legs and feete, their pounces and talons are very long, and in troth they will lightly refuſe to flée at nothing.</p>

                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:28166:26"/>At my being in Muſcouia, I ſaw ſundry Gerfalcons verie fayre and huge Hawkes, and of all other kinds of Hawkes, that onely bird is there had in account and regard, and is of greater price then any other. The reaſon whereof I learned of certaine Engliſh Marchants my country men, who tolde me, that the Emperors Maieſtie <hi>Iuan Vazaluich,</hi> did vſe to flée the Rauen with a caſt of Gerfalcons and tooke no ſlender plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and delight therein.</p>

Yet neuertheleſſe as they told me, they had ſéene a caſt of Gerfalcons beate her in ſuch wiſe, as ſhée hath béene forced to take the ſtand, and to pearch in a Pins or Fir trée for her ſuccour and ſafety. But that ſhift little preuayles, for no ſooner is ſhe pearched, but preſently by commandement of the Emperour, each Muſcouite drawing his hatchet from his backe, (without which toole they neuer trauell in that cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>The third is called Hyuair, or the Peleryn Sacre after the Egyptians and Aſſirians.</p>
               <p>She is called a Peleryn or Haggart, for that her eyrée is not knowne, and becauſe yearely ſhée maketh her paſſage towards Iudea, or Media, ſhée is taken in the Iles of Leuant, Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pres, Candy, and Rhodes. And therefore ſome thinke, ſhée conuneth out of Ruſſia, and Tartaria, and alſo from the great Sea. That Sacre that is taken an entermewer, is the beſt Hawke. The Sacre of all Hawkes the moſt labourſome, and beſt able to brooke her fleight. She is alſo peaceable and verie tractable, &amp; a Hawke that can beſt away with courſe and groſſe diet. The prey of the Sacre are great fowles, the Heron, the Gooſe, the Crane, Bytor, and withall the ſmall beaſtes of the field and forreſt.</p>
               <p>It is well to bée ſéen, that the Sacre is a Hawk ſomewhat larger then the Haggart Falcon, of a ruſty and ragged plume like the kite, the ſeare of her beake and foot like the Laner, her pounces but ſhort, neuertheleſſe, ſhe is of great force, &amp; hardie to all kind of fowle, as I haue already reported of the Hag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gart and Barbarie Falcons, but not ſo ventrous and frée to flée the Crane, or ſuch like game as the Haggart Falcon is.</p>
               <p>This Sacre is a paſſenger, euen as the Haggart Falcon is. No man is able truly to ſay, when ſhe eyréeth or diſcloſeth, but at the Rhodes they ſay they come from the parts of Ruſſia, &amp; Tartaria, and the Ocean ſea. Theſe Sacres are take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>in great number in the Iles of Leuant, Candy, Cipres, &amp; Rhodes, &amp; ſondry other Ilands in the Ocean ſea. But I muſt néeds con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe to you, that the Sacre is more diſpoſed to the field a great deale, then to the brooke As to flée the wild Gooſe, the Bittor, the Feſant, the Partridge, and all ſuch like fowles. And is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo dainty of her dyet, or to be kept, as the long winged hawkes are.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:28166:27"/>The Sacre is much like the Falcon Gentle for largeneſſ e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and the Haggart for hardines, and is a paſſenger as the Hag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gart is.</p>
               <p>She is a Hawk chiefly to flée the kite, and yet may be made and manned to flée the field, and ſtay other game of the field as the Falcon doth.</p>
               <p>The noble men that take pleaſure in the Sacre, to make a flight with her at the kite, do vſe this order &amp; deuiſe, to bring the kite downe from her mountée, for that in the heate of the day, ſhée doth vſe to ſoare and flée of an excéeding height in the cloudes, to take the comfort of the cold &amp; freſh ayre, that is in the middle region: They tie a foxe taile to the leg of a mallard or Ducke, whome they cauſe to be born on the fiſt of ſome one Falconer, and do ſo, let the ducke flée in the middeſt of a plaine, whome as ſoone as the kite diſcries from her pitch, ſhe preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bateth of her gate, and maketh her ſtooping to the ground, and there gazeth and woundreth at the ſtrangeneſſe, and the ſhape of this fowle: then do they caſt off the Sacre to the kite, who forthwith truſting to the goodnes of her wing, getteth vp to her pitch, as hie as poſſible ſhe may, by making often turns and wrenches in the ayre, where it is a very pleaſant ſport to behold the bickering that is betwixt them in the ayre, ſpecially if it be in a plaine where no trées or groues are, to hinder the ſight of the matter, and the day fayre, and not windie, for then will the Kite and Sacre ſoare ſo high, as they will flée clean out of ſight: But that ſerueth not the Kites purpoſe and turne, for the Sacre neuertheleſſe doth conqure her in the encounter, beating her to the ground by meane of the ſondry ſtoopinges &amp; downe-comes that ſhée maketh vpon her.</p>
               <p>They flée with the Sacre at two ſorts of Kites, that is, to the Kite royall, which is called by the Frenchman, the (<hi>Milan Royall</hi>) and at one other kind of Kite, called the blacke Kite, (the <hi>Milan Noyer</hi>) which is farre the more nimble bird of the two, and doth more buſily trouble the hawke in her flight then the other doth, by meane ſhe is the leſſe of the two, &amp; vſeth her wings farre better.

Their heads are white, &amp; flat aloft, blacke and large eyed, ſlender nares<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>, ſhort beake &amp; thicke, and leſſer then the Haggart Falcons, or the Falcon gentle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:28166:29"/>They are marble or ruſſet mailde, the breſt feathers white, full of ruſſet ſpots, the points and extremities of their feathers full of round white droppes. Their ſayles and traynlong, they are ſhort legged, with a foot ſomewhat leſſe then the Falcons, marble ſeered: but béeing mewed, they change the ſeere of the foot to a yellow.</p>
               <p>Theſe Hawkes will brooke to ffée long on their wings after their maner, and when they eſpie one that goeth abroad with a Sparowhawke to the field, they preſently follow &amp; couer the ſpaniels, ſo as no ſooner is the ſparowhawk caſt off to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge, but if ſhée miſſe or come ſhort of her game, the Laner ſtoopeth with great nimbleneſſe of wing, and eyther killeth the fowle, or otherwiſe enforceth it to ſtoope and fall amid the flight to the ground.</p>
               <p>You ſhall neuer lightly ſée a Laner lie vpon the wings, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhée hath flien to marke, but after one ſtouping, ſhe maketh a point, and then doth awaite for the fowle after the maner of a Goſhawke: for if ſhe miſſe at the firſt downe-come, of kill not in the foote, ſhe is by nature ſo ſlothfull and dull, as ſhée will ſéeke the aduantage to her greateſt eaſe: and therefore, dooth commonly vſe vpon the queſting, and call of the Spaniels, to attend very diligently, and ſo to prey at her pleaſure.</p>
               <p>They are highly eſtéemed in France, &amp; (as they ſay) ther made to the riuer, and there doe they vſe to flée with the a caſte or leaſh of Laners to the brooke, and ſometimes with the Laners and Lanerets together, and ſometimes doe flée the field with the Laner: but in Italy they doe not vſe this kinde of hawke at all. With vs in England this kind of Hawke is in price, but accounted very ſlothfull and hard mettled, ſo as vnleſſe you kéepe a very hard hand vpon her, ſhée will doe little good, cleane contrary to the nature of a Falcon gentle, who for one good v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage will ſhew a treble curteſie, and the better ſhe is rewarded the better will ſhée flée: but vſe the Laner wel, and ſhée maketh ſlender account therof, but becommeth ſlothfull, and vnapt to flée eyther field, or riuer.</p>

               <head>The cauſe why ſhee is called a Tunycian.</head>
               <p>THis Falcon is tearmed a Tunician, for that ordinarily &amp; moſt vſually ſhée is found to eyre in Barbarie, euen as I haue reported to you, that the Laner doth in France and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. And becauſe Tunyce is the head and chiefe Cittie in all Barbarie, and the Prince and ſtate there commorant and moſt abiding, holding the Court there, and do moſt chifely vſe to flée with theſe kinde of Falcons of all others, they are moſt chiefly tearmed Tunycians.</p>
               <p>The Tunycian may alſo be called a Punycian Falcon, for that which we reade of the warres Punicke, againſt the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginenſes, being maintayned againſt the inhabitants of that pace, where now is ſituated Tunyce.</p>
               <p>The Tunycian is large, approaching néere the nature of a Laner, and very like in plume and male, and not vnlike for the ſeare of her foot, but ſomewhat leſſe, and of a longer ſlight: her head is large and round.</p>
               <p>They are excellent good for the riuer, and will lye well vpon their wings, and flye the field well, as I haue ſayd before of the Laner. They doe naturally take pleaſure to ſtrike and ſeaze vpon the Hare, and all other kind of prey whatſoeuer.</p>
               <p>This kind of Falcons is not ſo ordinarie or common in all parts and regions, as other hawkes are, ſaue onely in Barbarie and Tunyce.</p>

               <p>THere is a kind of Falcon that is called a Merlyn. Theſe Merlyns are very much like the haggart falcon in plume, in ſeare of the foot, in beake and tallons. So as there ſameth to be no ods or difference at all betwixt them, ſaue only in the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, for ſhe hath like demeanure, like plume, &amp; very like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions to the Falcon, and in her kind is of like courage, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt be kept as choicely, and as daintily as the Falcon.</p>
               <p>Aſſuredly diuers of theſe Merlyns, become paſſing good
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:28166:31"/>
Hawkes and very ſkilfull, their property by nature is to kill Thruthes, Larkes, &amp; Partridges. They flee with greater firce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, &amp; more hotely then any other hawke of prey. They are of greater pleaſure, and full of courage, but a man muſt make greater care, and take good héed to them, for they are ſuch buſie &amp; vnruely things with their beakes, as diuers times they eate off their own feet and talons very vnnaturally, ſo as they die of it. And this is the reaſon and true cauſe, that ſeldom or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſhall you ſee a mewed, or entermewed Merlin. For that in the mew they doe ſpoyle themſelues, as I haue before declared.</p>
               <p>My Italian Authour hath theſe words, both of the ſhape and in commendation of the Merlin.</p>
               <p>The Merline is (ſaith he) of the ſhape of a Falcon, leſſe than the Sparowhawke, more nimble and wight of wing than any other Hawke, ſhe doth kill all ſuch game and prey as the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowhawk doth vſe to ſlay, ſpecially ſmal birds, namely Larks, Sparowes and ſuch like, all which ſhée doth purſue with excée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding cruelty and courage.</p>
               <p>She is reported to be a Hawke of the fiſt, and not of the lure, albeit a man may if he will, make her to the lure alſo. She is a very ventrous hawke and hardy, by this we may coniectture it: For though ſhée be little bigger then a pigeon, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, ſhe will hazard her ſelfe to flée the Partridge, the Quail, and ſuch other like fowles, more large then her ſelfe, &amp; will purſue them in ſo cruell manner; as ſundry times ſhe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth them, euen to the villages and townes whether the ſilly birdes doe flee for ayde and reſcue, from their naturall foe the Hawke.</p>
               <p>The Merlin is the only Hawke of all others, in whom as my authour affirmeth, there is no difference betwixt the male &amp; fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, but yet by experience we find it otherwiſe, for the female is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> larger bird of the two, &amp; more big then the other in ſight.</p>
               <p>Some are of opinion, that <hi>Lidos, Hieraz</hi> in Gréek &amp; <hi>Levis Accipiter</hi> in Latine, is our Merlin of whom we ſpeake, &amp; that thoſe birds of prey whome <hi>Aristotle</hi> termeth (<hi>Leves</hi>) to our iudgement ſhould be the Merlins, becauſe they are the leſſe Hawkes of all others that are to be found.</p>

               <p>OF all birdes of prey that belong to the Falconers vſe, I know none leſſe then the Hobbie, vnles it be the Merlin. The Hobby is a Hawke of the lure, and not of the fiſt: alſo ſhée is of the number of thoſe Hawkes that are hie flying &amp; towre Hawks, as the Falcon, the Laner, and the Sacre be. If a man be diſpoſed to deſcribe the Hobby, he cannot do better, nor deale more artificially, then to match her for ſhape with the Sacre.
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:28166:32"/>
For in good faith there is but ſmall difference or inequality be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, ſaue that the Sacre is farre the huger birde.</p>
               <p>The property of the Hobbye in all countries and regions where they are eyred, or otherwiſe brought, is to ſoar, and flée vpon the Huntſmen and Falconers, &amp; ſo to follow them verie watchfully, to the end that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſpring or put vp any ſmal birds, ſhe may ſtoope from her wings, and ſeaze on them, as on her prey. And this is ſo ordinarie a Hawk, &amp; the practice that I ſpeake of ſo general, as there is not the ſimpleſt bowre or pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant but doth know it. I can make no fitter nor more apt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, then to reſemble the frye &amp; ſmall fiſh of the Sea, being had in chaſe by the huger ſort of fiſh deſirous to deuour them: to the ſmall fowles and birdes of the ayre, purſued by the Hobby.</p>
               <p>For as ſoone as the ſilly fiſh that is chaſed by the Dolphin &amp; ſuch like, do perceiue their ſafety to be nothing in the Element of water, where, by God and Nature they are allotted to liue, eftſoon haue they their recourſe to the ayre to ſaue themſelues, choſing rather to lye at the mercy of the rauening ſea-fowles, ſoaring vpon the water, then to yeelde themſelues in prey to their naturall aduerſaries the fiſh: Euen ſo the Hobbies per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyuing the Huntſmen or Falconers in the fielde to hunt the poore Leueret, or flée the Partridge, do forthwith accompanie them, ſoaring vpon them, in hope to encounter ſome one ſmall bird or other, whome the hounds or ſpaniels ſhal by fortune put vp, &amp; ſpring by ranging the field. Then the Larks, &amp; ſuch like ſmall fowles, whoſe nature is not to braunch or take the trée, but altogether to liue vpon the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, finding the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the hounds &amp; ſpaniels to beguile the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, are enforſt to truſt to their wings, &amp; to take the ayre, &amp; being there, finding the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelus moleſted by the Falconers &amp; Hobbies, do make their choyce &amp; election to become a prey rather to the dogs, or ſéeke mercy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the horſe legs, &amp; ſo to be ſurpriſed aliue, then to affie in the curteſie of the cruell Hobbies, and to be taken in their cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell tallons, where they are moſt aſſured to die the death.</p>
               <p>The Hobbie is ſo nimble &amp; wight of wing, that ſhée dares encounter the Crow, and to giue ſouſe for ſouſe, and blow for
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:28166:32"/>
blow with him in the ayre.</p>
               <p>This is a naturall and ſpeciall tricke that ſhée doth vſe, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpying the Falconers in the field, ſhe doth follow them, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend on them, but it is but for a certaine ſpace as though in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye deede ſhée had her limits and boundes precribed her, and appointed how farre he ſhould flée. For as ſoone as ſhee lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them, ſhée preſently ſcoureth along the ſide of ſome groue or high wood, where doth ordinarily vſe to pearch and take the ſtand.</p>
               <p>The Hobby hath a blew beake, but the ſeare of her beak and legges is yellow. The crinet or little blacke feathers vnder her eyes be very blacke, ſo as moſt commonly they continue and procéed from the beake to the temples or eare burres, and in like manner is there an other blacke ſtreak that deſcendeth to eyther ſide of her gorge. As touching the toppe of the head it is betwixt blacke and yellow, but hath two white ſeames vpon the necke. The plumes vnder the gorge, and about the browes are reddiſh without ſpotte or droppe. The plumes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the belly (or as I may beſt tearm them) the breaſt feathers are browne for the moſt part, and yet poudered with white ſpots as Ermines. All the backe, the trayne, and the wings are blacke aloft, ſhe hath no great ſcales vpon her leggs, vnleſſe it be a few that begin behind the thrée ſtretchers and pounchies, which are very large in reſpect of her ſhort legges. Her brayle feathers are engouted twixt redde and blacke. The pendant feathers (which are thoſe behind the thigh) are of a ruſty and ſmokie verniſh complection. When a man ſeeth her ſoare aloft in the ayre, he will iudge her vnder the wings, that her plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and downe, as well of her wings as betwixt her legs is ruſſet and reddiſh mayled.</p>
               <p>There are two fowles, whereof the one is called, (<hi>Ian le blancke</hi>) which I take to be the Harrohen or capped Kite, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other (<hi>blanche queue</hi>) the ring tayle, who do alwaies flée with her for company, beating and ſouſing the Larks, and if happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they ſpie the Hobby encountring the Larke, whome they put and force to her wings, it is a pleaſure to behold the game
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:28166:33"/>
that is betwixt this caſt of buſſards and the hawke. For their deſire and intent is to bereaue the ſillye hobby of her prey: but ſhe being nimble and wight of wing, encountreth with them, entercepting the Larke from them, mauger their might, and ſondry times they buckle ſo together, as you ſhal ſée them come tu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bling down both I fear, one faſt griping &amp; ſeazed on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other.</p>
               <p>Some would haue that this Hobby of whom I write ſhould bée that bird whome <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> calleth <hi>Hipotriorchis,</hi> and the Latines <hi>Subuteo</hi>: but I am not of that mind, but that it ſhould rather be the <hi>Sacre,</hi> whome <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> doth meane. But let the learned reader Iudge the controuerſie, I am to lay down their natures and properties, and not to decide any matter of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie, which indéede doth belong to the curious Falconer, and not to him that doth embrace more the ſport, then the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie and oddes of ſpéech, which in euery Art a man ſhalbe aſſured to find. Let it ſuffice if I giue the Reader to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the nature of euery Hawke now a dayes in vſe, and withall (according to my promiſe and meaning) doe let him know the meane to flie with them both the field and brooke, as alſo to giue him to witte, how to Mew, Ympe, and cure them being diſeaſed. Theſe are the ſpeciall points, and ſuch as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue thankes from me, and commendation from him. I will procéede in the deſcription of the nature of this Hawke, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the opinion of the Italian.</p>

               <p>THe Hobbies are more large then the Merlyns, &amp; for beak, eyes, plume &amp; foot, they very much reſemble the Falcon.

               <p>Some Gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue made report &amp; for truth aſſured me, that the Emperour <hi>Ferdinando</hi> of famous memorie, did giue his Falconers in charge to kéepe &amp; reclaime ſundry Hobbies. And his Maieſtie diuers times for recreation, would take his Horſe, and into the fields with a Hobbie on his fiſt, holding in his right hand a long ſlender pole, or réed ſeuen foot in length, on the toppe whereof there was conueighed by ſleight a ſtrong line with a ſliding knotte: And when happily his Maieſtie had eſpied a larke on the ground, he would forthwith holde vp, and aduance his Hobbie, to the view of the ſilly birde, whome as ſoone as the Larke ſaw, he would in no wiſe dare to ſpring, but lie as ſtill as a ſtone flat vpon the earth, ſo fearful they are of the Hobbie, in cheif of all other Hawks: then would the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour at his good leaſure, and great pleaſure, with his longe pole and the ſliding line, take the ſillye fowle and draw her vp vnto him, and truely tooke no ſmall delight in this kinde of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtime, and would cauſe his Falconers to doe likewiſe, who by this deuiſe tooke many birdes, and in this ſorte woulde they Hawke fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the beginning of September to the end of October.</p>

               <p>The firſt and moſt noble kinde, is the female Goſhawke, which is with vs moſt ordinarily in vſe.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is named a demy Author, or Goſhawke, as it were a kind betwixt two other ſorts, and that is a ſpare ſlender hawke, and of little regarding reſpect of any good ſhe will doe.</p>
               <p>The third is the Tyercell which is the male, or cocke to the Goſhawke, who doth flay the Partridge, &amp; is not of ſufficient force to kill the Crane. He is termed a Tyercelet, for that there are moſt commonly diſcloſed three birds in one ſelfe eyrée, two Hawkes, and one Tiercell.</p>
               <p>The fourth kinde of Autour is the Sparrowhawke, whoſe nature is to kill all kind of prey that the Goſhawke doth, ſaue onely the larger ſort of fowles.</p>
               <p>The fift kind is called (<hi>Sabech</hi>) whome the Egiptians term (<hi>Baydach</hi>) which doth very much reſemble the Sparrowhauk, but is leſſe then the Sparowhawke, and hath a very blew eye.</p>
               <p>There are ſundry ſorts of Goſhawkes, and thoſe brought and conueyed out of ſundry forraine parts and regions, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them all, that Goſhawke that is bred &amp; eyred in Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia &amp; Perſia, is the principall beſt hawke, &amp; then next to her in goodneſſe, the hawke of Gréece, and laſtly that of Affricke.</p>
               <p>The Hawke of Armenia hath her eyes gréen, but the beſt of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kind is ſhe that hath black eyes &amp; black plumes on her backe.</p>
               <p>The hawke of Perſia is large, well plumed, cleare and déepe eyed, with hanging and pendand eye-lids and browes.</p>
               <p>The hawke of Gréece hath a great head, well ſeaſoned, a ſtrong necke, and is reaſonable well plumed.</p>
               <p>The Goſhawke of Affricke hath blacke eyes in her ſoarage, but being a mewed hawke, her eyes become reddiſh and fiery.</p>
               <p>At what times Hawkes begin to fall to liking, which is at Eawking time, all birds of prey do aſſemble themſelues with the Goſhawke, and do flocke together. As namely the Falcon, the Sacre, and ſuch other that liue on prey, and rauine.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:28166:35"/>And hereof it procéedeth that the Goſhawkes become ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers in goodneſſe, force, and hardineſſe, according to the diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of their choyce and cawking.</p>
               <p>The beſt Goſhawke ought to be waighty, and a heauie bird, as thoſe of great <hi>Armenia</hi> be.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Syria</hi> they make choice of their hawkes, by the Maſſines &amp; poyſe of them, and do eſtéem the moſt weighty hawke for the beſt: as for the male &amp; conditions they doe litle regard or prize.</p>
               <p>The blancke Goſhawke is the largeſt, the fayreſt &amp; moſt apt, and eaſie to bee reclaymed, and withall the ſtrongeſt of all Hawkes of that ſort, for ſhée can kill the Crane.

               <p>The Goſhawke that doth encline and tend to a black mayle, and that hath ſuperfluous plumes on her head, reaching down her front or forehead, like a peruque or borrowed hayre, that is a very fayre Hawke for beauty, but nothing ſtrong.</p>

               <head>The good proportion and ſhape of a Goſhawke.</head>
               <p>SHée ought to haue a ſmall head, her face long &amp; ſtraight like the Vulture or Eagle, a large wind pipe or throat, great eies déepe ſet, and the apple or middle part of the eye blacke, nares, eares, backe and féet, large and blancke, a blancke long beake, long necke, big breaſt, hard fleſh, long thighes, fleſhie, &amp; diſtant one from the other, the bone of the legge and knée ſhort, long and large pounces, and talons.</p>
               <p>The ſhape from the ſterne or traine to the breaſt forward, ought to grow to a roundneſſe. The feathers of the thighes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the traine ſhould be large, and the traine feathers ſhort, ſoft and ſomewhat tending to an yron mayle.</p>
               <p>The brayle feathers ought to be like the breaſt feathers, and the couert feathers of the traine ſhould be ſpotted, and full off blacke rondels, but the colour of the very extremity and point

               <p>The ſigne of boldneſſe in a Goſhawke is this, tie her in an open light place, and after a while darken and obſcure it, by ſhutting ſome window, or ſuch like deuiſe, then touch her vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſodaine at vnawares, if ſhe then iumpe, and leape to the fiſt without feare or aſtoniſhment, that is an aſſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>A Token of goodneſſe and excellency in thoſe demie Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawkes, whom my Author doth tearme (<hi>Petite Autours</hi>) is to haue large and cleare eyes, a ſmall head, long neck, low, and cloſe plume or downe, hard fleſh, a gréene ſéere of her foote, large ſtretchers, and not goutie or fleſhie, quicke enduing, large panell, and able to ſliſe farre from her when ſhe mewteth.

a great head, a ſhort necke, to be thick and groſſe plumed, ſoft fleſhed, ſhort thighed, long armed, ſhort tallons, tawnie hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, tending to blacke, and hard and rough vnder the foote.</p>
               <p>A Goſhawke that when ſhe is looſe in the houſe, flees as though ſhe were at large and liberty, breaking out of a mew, hauing great groſſe feathers, eyes as red as blood, that is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermore baiting, and being ſet on the pearch, offereth to flée at the face of a man, ſuch a Hawke if ſhée be kept low in fleſh cannot be borne on the fiſt; if ſhée bée hie and full of fleſh, ſhée will not then abide with her kéeper, but rangle &amp; gad: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of ſuch Hawkes, there is no account to be made at all.</p>
               <p>A fearefull Goſhawke is hardly to be reclaimed and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, for the feare ſhee hath, will alwaies cauſe her to refuſe the fiſt and lure, and make her checke, and not willingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payre to any deuiſe wherewith ſhée is called and rappeld, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter her flight, which is a very great inconuenience in a Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawke, and no ſmall hinderance to the ſport of him that ſhall happen to haue ſuch a fearefull Hawke: for commonly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they be firſt fond of the kéeper, and in loue with the call, they will not flée their game to the liking of their owner; and the tediouſnes in comming by them againe after the flight, doth bréed forgetfulneſſe of the paſtime, how good and delecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſoeuer it were before.</p>
               <p>That Goſhawke that hath pendant plumes ouer her eyes, and (as they ſay in the Country) whoſe feathers hang in her light, the white of whoſe eye is very watriſh and blanck, that is red maild, or bright tawnie, hath the moſt aſſured token that may be of ill conditions, and is not like to bée well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.

            <div type="section">
               <head>Out of the French I haue collected this concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Goſhawke.</head>
               <p>Some men haue thought, and béene of this reſolute mind, that the (Author) or Goſhawke hath béene of the kinde of a Vulture, for the affinity and neareneſſe of their tearmes and names: for (Autour) in the French, is that Hawke whome we call the Goſhawke, and (Vautour) is the Vulture, which 2. tearmes as you ſée, draw very neare to one ſpeech.</p>
               <p>Some other haue béen of opinion, that betwixt the Goſhawk and Sparowhawke, is no ods or difference in nature, ſaue on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in reſpect of the hugeneſſe of that one, and the ſlenderneſſe of the other: but my purpoſe is to treat of the Goſhawke ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally from the Sparowhawke, and ſo to procéede to the Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowhawke, of whome I will write according to the French &amp; Italian Authors, in a ſeuerall Chapter by it ſelfe, to avoide the confuſion, which otherwiſe might happen in that behalfe.</p>
               <p>The Goſhawke is euer more regarded than her Teircell, for the males or cockes among Hawkes and birds of prey, doe make euident proofe, and ſhew to the eye, of their difference fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the females and Hawkes.</p>
               <p>Againe we may with eaſe diſcerne the Goſhawke from her Tyercell, for that ſhée is farre larger, then the Tyercell of her kind.</p>
               <p>The Falconers &amp; Oſtregers, haue to theſe two ſorts, added a third kind (as I ſayd before) whome they teranie the Demy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goſhawke, as a bird indifferent, betwixt the other twoo.</p>
               <p>Both kinds of them are more hie, and longer armed, then eyther the Falcon, or Gerfalcon: they are Hawkes of the fiſt, and (as we call them) round winged Hawkes, quite contrarie
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:28166:37"/>
to thoſe I wrote of before, all which are Hawkes of the lure, and long winged Hawkes, otherwiſe called Towre hawkes.</p>
               <p>The Hawke (I meane the female) is very much like the Eagle in mayle, and if we may make bold to compare y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> leſſe with the larger, ſhe hath a more ſtately high necke then the Eagle, &amp; of a more red or yron mayle, the ground of her plume and downe tending to a red colour.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Goſhawkes that are of Slauonia, are good at all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of game, large, hardy, &amp; faire plumed, their tongs blacke, and their nares great and wide.</p>
               <p>There are Goſhawkes, whome the Italians call <hi>Alpiſani,</hi> or hawkes of the Alpes, which are much vſed in Lombardie, &amp; Tuſcane, they are more thick the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are long, fierce, &amp; hardy.</p>
               <p>But thoſe Goſhawks that our Oſtregers haue now adayes, are cheifly conueied out of Almaine, hauing their eyes &amp; the ſeare of the beake, as alſo of their féet and legs yellow, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to the Gerfalcon, whoſe ſeare is blew and azure.</p>
               <p>Their traines are garniſhed with large droppes or ſpottes croſſing the feather, party blacke, and party grey, as alſo the plumes of the necke and head are more towards a ruſſet, and powdred with blacke, but thoſe of the thigh, and vnder the belly or pannell, are otherwiſe marked, for they are not full ſo yellow, hauing round drops on them, not much vnlike thoſe that are on the Peacockes trayne.</p>
               <p>The Goſhawkes of Almayne are not very fayre, though they be large Hawkes, red mayled, and yet not hardy.</p>
               <p>There are ſundry of them good in their ſoarage, but being once mewed, proue nothing worth: there be diuers of them ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the forreſt of Arde, and in ſundrie places of Almayne. The Gréekes haue called the Goſhawke <hi>Hierax,</hi> the Latines <hi>Accipiter stellaris,</hi> and the Italians <hi>Aſtuy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus much haue I collected out of another French author, as neceſſarily belonging to the deſcription of the nature of a Goſhawk, becauſe you ſhall ſee the ſeuerall opinions of ſundry writers, and gather to your owne vſe, what ſhall occurre and thwart beſt with your liking, for it is not the mayle and plume

               <p>Firſt of all there are Goſhawkes, calledt Armenia hawkes, much differing from the Goſhawke, in ſort as almoſt, they haue no reſemblance at all to the other kinds of Goſhawkes. They are very faire and huge, the mayle of them is blanke, as ſundry Haggart Falcons be, they flée with great courage and life, all greater ſort of fowles.</p>
               <p>There are others eyried in <hi>Slavonia</hi> and <hi>Dalmacia,</hi> and thence are they tearmed Slauon Goſhawkes, which indéed are good for any thing a man will employ them vnto. Very faire and hardy hawkes, large footed, very well penned, their downe and plumage excellent fine, their tongues blacke, and their nares large and wide</p>
               <p>Thoſe of Sardinia are nothing like the other hawkes, they are browne and ruſſet plumed, ſmall hawkes, hard and not ſmall footed, and nothing ventrous.</p>
               <p>Thoſe of <hi>Calament</hi> are ſhort truſſed hawkes, and large, blanke ſeared on the foot, thoſe flée the greater fowles excéeding

well.</p>
               <p>The Goſhawkes of the Alpes, and of <hi>Calabria,</hi> are in a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner more large then they are long, very prowde, and hardy Hawkes.</p>
               <p>The Goſhawkes of <hi>Lombardy</hi> are not very large, browne maylde, and cowardly kytes to do any good.</p>
               <p>The Goſhawke of <hi>Ruſſia</hi> and <hi>Sarmatia,</hi> is a large and huge Hawke, the moſt part of them are blanke Hawkes, and taken vp of great Princes and Nobles ſtates, they are apt and able to doe any thing that may be looked for from Hawkes of that kind. My ſelfe haue ſéene great ſtore of them in the Citie of <hi>Moſqua,</hi> which is the chiefe Dukedome of all <hi>Ruſſia.</hi> The <hi>Moſcovites</hi> and <hi>Tartarians</hi> do vſe to flée with thoſe Goſhawks at the brooke, and there do beat vp the fowle with the drumme, without which you ſhall ſeldome ſée a Boyaron (as they tearme them) which is a Gentleman, ryde at any time. And one ſpeciall thing which I noted among them was, that as well <hi>Moſcovites</hi> as <hi>Tartaros,</hi> do vſe to beare their Hawkes on the right fiſt, which is cleane contrary to our manner and guiſe héere in England, or in any other Region that I haue heard or ſéene, ſaue onely in thoſe North parts, no reaſon I can yéeld for it, but that each country for the moſt part hath his faſhion.</p>
               <p>Thoſe of <hi>Friulie</hi> are good Hawkes and large, but not ſo faire as the <hi>Slavon</hi> Hawkes.</p>
               <p>Note this, that a good Goſhawke ought to be little, and broad ſhouldred, large breaſted, very round and fleſhly, hauing a long thigh, a ſhort legge or arme, and the ſame great, and a large foote, and not gowty, but ſlender. Contrariwiſe, the Tiercell ſhould be large, for it is a common ſaying,</p>
               <p>A little Hawke, and a large Tiercell, is euer beſt.</p>
               <p>All Goſhawks are by nature gréedy, and catching, of whome ſome doe vſe to flée the riuer, and freſh brookes, and ſome the Sea, and otherſome againe the field, and neuer or very ſeldome the riuer or brooke.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:28166:38"/>The firſt ſort for the moſt part doe prey vpon Duckes, Géeſe, Hearons, Shouelers, and ſuch like fowle as do vſually haunt, and liue in the Sea and Riuers. And thoſe diuers times doe ſeaze and take their prey vppon the ſodayne at vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares, by fléeing low neare the ground, and ſtealing vpon the fowle.</p>
               <p>The other, after a while that they haue vſed to flée the field, do prey on Pigeons, Pullets, Hennes, and Partridges. And being once mewed Hawkes, and paſt their ſoarage, they will take the ſtand vpon ſome trée, and finding eyther Partridge, Fezant, Pullet, Henne, or ſuch other like fowle, they make their ſtooping ſo fiercely, and in ſuch great haſt, and doe flée them ſo farre before head and at randon, mayntaining, and making good their flight, as in the end they kill them, and doe prey vpon them.</p>
               <p>Of the Goſhawkes, thoſe that be ventrous and hardy will kill the Hare, and hauing kilde him, diuerſe times they ſwallow in for haſt great bones, and doe put them ouer very well, and endure them ſafely without any hurte of all.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that are the riuer Goſhawkes, and doe haunt the water, and brookes, are commonly the moſt hardy and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Hawkes of all that kind, and doe at the Riuer of their owne inclination and nature, fall to kill the great Fowles of the Riuer, of which I haue before made recitall and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Truely the Goſhawke is very much to be regarded for her hardy mettle and courage, for that therein ſhée is not inferiour to any kind of Hawke, but rather more fierce and eager. And againe to bee kept with greater care, for that ſhée is more choyce and daynty, and dooth looke to haue a more nice hand kept on her, then any other kind of Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con or Hawke, vnleſſe it be the Sparrowhawke, which is all

               <p>I do not here in this place deale exactly of the mayles, and plumes of theſe kinds of hawkes, in part, for that the hawkes are of ſundry and ſeuerall plumes, according to the diuerſity of countries and regions where they are eyréed: and part, for that the hawks themſelues are ſo ordinarily in vſe, as it were to be eſtéemed but a ſuperſluous labour, to waſte much time therein, in penning of that, which is (in the opinion of men) of no great importance. My chiefe care and induſtrye (if health allow me leaue, and ſickneſſe too much offend not my eaſe) ſhall conſiſt in the reclaymed and manning of all theſe kindes of Hawkes, according to their natures and properties, and in diſplaying the meanes to flée with them, and to kéepe them, both for the field and brooke.

               <head>Of the Matagaſſe.</head>
               <p>THough the Matagaſſe bée a Hawke of no account, or price, neyther with vs in any vſe, yet neuertheleſſe, for that in my diuiſion I made recitall of her name, according to the French Author, from whence I collected ſundrye of thoſe points and documents, appertaining to Falconrie: I thinke it not beſide my purpoſe, briefly to deſcribe héere vnto you, though I muſt néedes confeſſe, that where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Hawke is of ſo ſlender value, the definition, or rather deſcription of her na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and name, muſt be thought of no great regard.</p>
               <p>The ſhape of her is this.</p>
               <p>She is beaked and headed like the Falcon, her plume is of two colours, her breaſt white, her eye, beake, and féete blacke, a long blacke traine, her flags and long feathers partly blacke, and white, and the colour of thoſe feathers ſhee changeth not, though ſhe mew neuer ſo oft.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:28166:41"/>Her feeding is vpon Rattes, Squirrells, and Liſardes, and ſometime vpon certaine birdes ſhee doth vſe to prey, whome ſhe doth intrappe and deceiue by flight, for this is her deuiſe:</p>
               <p>She will ſtand at pearch vpon ſome trée or poſt, and there make an exceeding lamentable crye, and exclamation, ſuch as birdes are wonte to doe, being wronged, or in hazard of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, and all to make other fowles beleiue &amp; thinke that ſhe is very much diſtreſſed, and ſtands néedefull of ayde, wherevpon the credulous ſellie birdes do flocke together preſently at her call and voice, at what time if any happen to approach neare her, ſhée out of hand ſeazeth on them, and deuoureth them, (vngratefull ſubtill fowle) in requitall of their ſimplicity and paines.</p>
               <p>Theſe hawkes are in no accompt with vs, but poore ſimple fellowes and peaſants ſometimes do make them to the fiſte, and being reclaimed after their vnſkilfull manner, doe beare them hooded, as Falconers doe their other kindes of Hawkes whome they make to greater purpoſes.</p>
               <p>Here I end of this hawke, becauſe I neither accompt her worthe the name of a hawke, in whome there reſteth no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour or hardines, ne yet deſeruing to haue any more written of her property and nature, more than that ſhée was in mine Author ſpecified, as a member of my diuiſion, and there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted in the number of long winged hawkes. For truely it is not the property of any other Hawke, by ſuch deuiſe and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly wile to come by her prey, but they loue to winne it be mayne force of winges at random, as the round winged hawkes doe, or by frée ſtooping as the hawkes of the Tower doe moſt commonly vſe, as the Falcon, Gerfalcon, Sacre, Merlin, and ſuch like which doe lie vpon their wing, roding in the ayre, and ruffe the fowle, or kill it at the encounter.</p>

               <p>Firſt, it is behoouefull for a Falconer to bée verie dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent &amp; inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue to learne and marke the qualitie and mettle of his hawkes, &amp; to know which hawke he ſhall flye with all
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:28166:43"/>
earely, and with which late, becauſe all Hawkes are not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed or mettled alike. Wherefore the firſt and ſpeciall obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation is, to note the naturall inclination and diſpoſition of his hawkes in that behalfe.</p>
               <p>Then next, it is neceſſarie for him to be found ouer his hawk, patient, and withall carefull to kéepe her cleane out of lyfe, mytes, and all ſuch other diſeaſes, as I ſhall hereafter treate of in the latter part of this collection, with ſuch remedies, as I ſhall lay downe for euery gréefe. And of the two, hée muſt rather keepe his Hawke hie, and full of fleſh, than poore and low. Beſides that, this is one generall rule, which by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience you ſhall find to be moſt true, that all kindes of hawkes are more ſubiect to infirmities, being poore and low, then when they are luſty and full in fleſh.</p>
               <p>Euery night, after he hath flyen with his Hawke the day, eyther at the field or brooke, he muſt giue his hawke caſting, ſomewhiles plumage, ſome other while pellets of Cotton, or ſuch like, &amp; again, ſometimes ſome one medicine or other, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as by her caſting, or mewte, hée ſhall perceiue her to ſtand néedefull thereof, which point I will more at large deſcribe in another place, proper and peculiar to that matter.</p>
               <p>Euery night hée muſt not forget to make the place verye cleane vnder the pearch, ſo as hée may both find the caſting of his Hawke, and be certainely aſſured whether ſhée hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready caſt or not, whereby he may the better iudge and diſcern her ſtate. For by the caſting is found, whether the Hawke doe néed eyther vpward or downeward ſcowrings, or ſtones, or any ſuch like remedy.</p>
               <p>He muſt remember euery euening to tye out his hawke a weathering, ſaue onely in ſuch dayes, as ſhée hath bathed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for becauſe then the taking ouermuch moyſture, will bréed her a thouſand euils, and inconueniences. For ſuch euenings as ſhe hath bathed the day, ſhée ought of right to be placed in ſome warme chamber on a pearch, with a candle burning by her, where ſhe muſt ſit vnhooded, if ſo ſhe be gentle
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:28166:43"/>
and not rammage, to the end ſhee may tricke her ſelfe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce by enoyling her after the water, before ſhee flee againe.</p>
               <p>Euery morning earely he muſt not forget to ſet her out to wether her, where if ſhée haue not already caſt, ſhée may caſt, and there kéepe her hooded, till ſuch time as ſhee goe to the field.</p>
               <p>In féeding his hawke, hée muſt beware of giuing her twoo ſorts of meat at one time to gorge her withall, neither muſt he giue her ſuch fleſh, as hath any euill ſauour, and is not ſwéet, but muſt reſpect to allow her wholeſome meates for bréeding ill diſeaſes. For hawkes are dainty birds in their kind, and the more to be conſidered of when they are in hand vnder a Falco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners kéeping &amp; vſage, becauſe they were wont to prey for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues at liberty, and therein follow ſuch law and order, as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had preſcribed them, but being reſtrayned, the courſe of kind is quite altered in them, and therefore therefore the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter art and regard to be vſage for them. Art muſt ſupply the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints of kind by cunning.</p>
               <p>He muſt beware, if happily he haue occaſion of neceſſary bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, at his departure from home, not to leaue his hawke ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on a pearch of any great height from the ground, for feare of bating and hanging by the héeles, for then eyther will ſhée caſt her gorge, or otherwiſe ſpoyle her ſelfe: but ſhée muſt be placed on a low blocke or ſtone, and if there be more hawks then one, they muſt be ſondred ſo farre one from the other, as they may not approach or reach one the other, neither with beake, talons, or otherwiſe, becauſe their nature is to bite, and buckle, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if they come within reach.</p>
               <p>When hée addreſſeth him to make his flight with his Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, it is behouefull for him to haue all her follow Falconers, or ſuch as haue hawkes in the field, to ſet downe their hawkes on the ground, to be in the more readineſſe to aſſiſt him in his purpoſe, and to tye them ſure, for feare of ill accidents that may be fall them.</p>
               <p>And again, at the riuer, he muſt be ſkilfull to land his fowle
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:28166:44"/>
ſo placing the reſidue of his company, and their hawkes, as they may flée eke without any encounter, which is not onely the loſſe of the fowle, and hinderance to their ſport, but alſo the ruine and ſpoyle of their hawkes on both parts. He muſt bée carefull that his hawke kéepe her gate, and flée it good, ſo as in no wiſe hée plucke her not downe, nor make her bate of her pitch.</p>
               <p>He muſt alwayes be aſſured to haue mummy in powder in his bagge in a readineſſe, whatſoeuer ſhould happen, with ſuch other medicines as I ſhall hereafter treate of, for that it may ſo fall out, as his hawke may receaue a brooſe at the encounter of a fowle. Moreouer hée muſt not bée vnfurniſhed of Aloes waſht, Cloues, Nutmegs, Saffron, caſting, cryance, and ſuch like neceſſary implements. And he muſt remember that his Aloes bée ſhining and cleare, for then is it of the beſt ſort of Aloes.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, he muſt be able to make his lures, hoods, of all ſorts, Ieſſes, Buets and other néedfull furniture for his hawke, and muſt not bée without ſtore thereof to allow his betters and ſtates in the field, if happily they want any ſuch deuiſes. He cannot well be without his coping Irons, to cope his hawkes beake if it be ouergrowne, which will be a hinderance to her féeding, and to cope her pounces and talons, if néed be. Hée muſt haue his cauterizing buttons, and other yron or ſiluer tooles, to cauterize or burne his hawkes if cauſe require ſuch cure. For hauing all theſe neceſſaries, and doing as I haue and will tell you, all his game ſhall ſuccéede and ſort well, and he be aſſured that for the moſt part of good paſtime in the field, when other ignorant grooms ſhal both lacke ſport, &amp; loſe their hawks, the greateſt corſie that may happen to a gentleman that loues the game.

               <p>FIrſt let your hawkes be taken on the fiſt and hooded, then let her be watched three dayes and nights, before you vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode her, and féede her alwayes hooded in an eaſie rufter hood. At the end of thrée dayes you may vnhoode her, and féede her vnhooded, and when ſhée is fed, hood her againe, ſo that ſhée bée not vnhooded (but when you féed her) vntil ſhe know her meat: then when ſhe beginneth to be acquainted with you, hood her and vnhoode her oftentimes, to the end ſhée may the better a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide the hood. But vſe her gently, and be patient with her at the firſt, and to the end your hawke may be the better manned &amp; the ſooner reclaimed, you ſhall do well to beare her commonly in places where moſt people do frequent, and where moſt exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes are vſed. And when ſhe is well manned, make her come a little to the fiſt for her meat. And when you haue ſhewed her the pearch or ſtocke, and tyed her vpon it, put with her vppon the ſayd pearch or ſtocke ſome Pullet, or other quicke fowle as often as you may, and let her féed there vpon at pleaſure vntill ſhe be reaſonably gorged, and doe in like manner vpon the lure vntill ſhée know it perfectly. Afterwards you may giue her more liberty, and lure her with a cryance, luring her twice a day further and further off. And when ſhée is throughly lured, you ſhall teach her to flée vppon you vntill ſhée know both how to get to her gate, and to flée round vppon you. Then ſhall you caſt her out ſome quicke Fowle, and when ſhée hath ſtooped and ſeazed vppon it, you ſhall ſuffer her to plume it, and to foote it at her pleaſure, giuing her a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble gorge thereon, as is afore ſayd, and continuing alwayes to reward her vpon the ſayd lure, in ſuch ſort that ſhée neuer find the lure without ſome reward tyed vppon it, and by
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:28166:45"/>
that meanes ſhée will alwayes loue the lewer and her kéeper well, and will not lightly rangle or be loſt. Thus you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue her fortie dayes or thereabouts, and then you may flée with her ſafe inough. But before you ſo doo, let her be ſkowred and bathed, and fed with cleane meat, and well waſhed, giuing her caſting euery night, euen as men vſe to giue fléeing Hawkes.</p>

For the Hawke ought to be well lured and well trayned to get vp to an high gate, and therewithall ſhee muſt well know a quicke fowle, and ſuch a Falcon as is apt to flée the Hearon, ſhould not bée flowen with to any other kind of fowle, but onely to the Hearon moſt commonly. For aſmuch as amongſt all other flights, there is no ſuch mountey made, nor ſuch force vſed as in the flight at the Hearon, and therefore reaſon would that ſuch Falcons ſhould not be flowen withall, or inured to any meaner or leſſe prey than the Hearon. For if a Hawke be a good Hearoner, it is ſufficient, and if after your Hawke haue flowen the Hearon, you ſhould let her flée any other ſleighter fowle or prey, ſhee will lightly (by your owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault) become a ſlugge and take diſdaine, in ſuch ſort; that (where before ſhée was a good Hearoner) ſhe wil be ſo no more, and will turne to her owne eaſe, ſo that ſhée will neuer care to flée the Hearon. For aſmuch as ſhée will giue her ſelfe to prey vppon fowle, that is more eaſie to reach, and will forget or foreſlowe her valiant hardineſſe, the which is much to bée la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, if a man haue once a good Hearoner, and doe ſo ſpill her. Neuertheleſſe you may flée with the Sacre all manner of fowle more eaſily than with any other kind of Hawke, becauſe ſhée is alike common to all ſowle, euen ſo is ſhe hard to be made, and of a hard and dull capacity, but deſpaire not therefore, for in the end they proue good, if the Falconer take ſuch paines with them as he ought to doe.</p>

Now when you haue doone as is before ſayd (whether ſhée bath or not) you ſhall take your Hawke vppon your fiſt, and ſo kéepe her on the fiſt vntill you goe to bedde, and when you goe to bedde ſet a candle before her, which may laſt all the night, and in the morning (if ſhe did bath) you ſhall ſet her in the Sunne for one howre vntill ſhée be well weathered, and then after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards (if ſhee did not bath) take wine and water, and therwith beſpout her well with your mouth thrée howres after, ſetting her in the Sunne againe, and (for lacke of Sunne-ſhine)
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:28166:47"/>
before the fire, vntyll ſhée bée very well dryed, and if you bée well aſſured that ſhee is throughly enſeamed cleane, and hath béen well manned by the ſpace of thirty or fortye dayes, then may you flée the fielde with her, and if you perceyue that ſhée hath good deſire to flée, let her flée, and if ſhée kill any thing giue her a good gorge therevpon, but if ſhée kill nothing, then feede her with the legge or the wing of an Henne or a Pullet waſhed in cleane running water, keeping her ſtill vpon the fiſte as is before ſayd: and the next day flee with her agayne, and if ſhe kill any thing, giue her her reward, and keepe her in this order vntill ſhe be perfectly entred and quarred: but then you muſt haue diſcretion, for ſometimes by this order, you may bring her low, in ſuch ſort that ſhe ſhould not eaſily be recouered to make her flight ſtrongly. Yet <hi>Martine</hi> ſayth the contrarye, but if an Hawke be very hard and ſtubborne to her Keeper in her flight, then let her be well ſpowted againe with luke-warme water, and ſo ſet abroade all night in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen ayre. In the morning let her bee ſet eyther in the Sunne or before the fire, where when ſhee hath well proyned her, you may goe flee with her, and if ſhee kill and flee well, then keepe her in this order and tune, for elſe ſhe may take ſundry euill toyes. And this precept ſerueth as well for them that deſire to haue good Hawkes for the fielde, as otherwiſe: and if you would haue your Hawkes loue their prey, take Cynamon and Sugarcandye, of each a like quantitie, and make thereof a powder, and when your Hawke hath killed any thing, &amp; that you come to rewarde her, ſprinckle ſome of that powder vpon the part wherewith you reward her, and it ſhall make her loue that kind of prey the better euer afterwardes.</p>

               <p>IF you haue Eyaſſe Hawks, you ſhall féede them moſt with Poultrie, Beefe, or Goates fleſh: and this is done to keepe them from ill toyes: and when they bée well lured and tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, then beare them vpon the fiſt hooded, and ordered in all points according to the rule preſcribed before in the firſt chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and after thirty or forty dayes paſt, bring them to the flight, and the firſt, ſecond, and third flight, you may bée fond ouer them, abating your fauour, afterwardes by little and little, vntill they be brought in perfect tune, ſpowting them often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with Wine and Water. For (as <hi>Martine</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) ſome Eyaſſe Hawkes will not much bath them. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe you ought therein alſo to vſe diſcretion, for by often bathing or ſpowting, you may bring your Hawke very low, in ſuch ſort, that ſhée ſhould haue more néede of a good gorge, than of bathing or ſpowting, and eſpecially ſuch Hawkes as are fierce of Nature, and will not often bathe of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.</p>

               <head>A conſideration of the Diverſitie of Hawkes Natures, acccording to Martine.</head>
               <p>THere are ſome ſortes of Falcons which haue this diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of nature, that ſome of them will flye well, being hie and full of fleſh, and ſome other flée beſt when they are kept low. Wherefore a Falconer ſhould haue eſpecyall conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration thereunto, for Falcons are fitte for all flightes, as is before ſaide, but the blanke Falcons are of one nature, and the blew Falcons of another, and the Falcon of the red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh plume hath alſo her properties diuers from the reſt.</p>

And the reaſon is, becauſe ſhée is very gentle, and with more eaſe manned then any other kind of Falcon, and loueth her kéeper better, ſo that thereby ſhée kéepeth her ſelfe higher, &amp; in better plight then ſuch Hawkes as bate much, and are froward of condition.</p>

               <p>A Sparowhawke newly taken ſhould be thus vſed, take a needle threeded with vntwiſted thread, and (caſting your Hawke) take her by the beake, &amp; put the needle through her eye lidde, not right againſt the ſight of the eye, but
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:28166:49"/>
ſomewhat nearer to the beake becauſe ſhe may ſee backwards. And you muſt take good heed that you hurt not the webbe, which is vnder the eye-lidde, or on the inſide thereof. Then put your needle alſo through that other eye-lidde, drawing the endes of the threed together, tye them ouer the beake, not with a ſtraight knotte, but cut off the threedes endes neare to the knotte, and twiſt them together in ſuch ſorte that the eye-liddes may be rayſed ſo vpwards, that the Hawke may not ſee at all, and when the threede ſhall waxe looſe or vntyed, then the Hawke may ſee ſomewhat backewardes, which is the cauſe that the threede is put nearer to the beake. For a Sparowhawke ſhould ſee ſomewhat backewardes, and a Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con forwards. The reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is, that if the Sparowhawke ſhould ſee forwards, ſhée would beate off her feathers, or breake them when ſhée bateth vpon the fiſt, and ſéeing the companie of men, or ſuch like, ſhe would bate to much.</p>
               <p>But to trimme your Sparowhawke in her rights, ſhée muſt haue Ieſſes of leather, the which muſt haue knottes at the end and they ſhould be halfe a foote long, or thereabout, at the leaſt a ſhaft-méete betweene the hooſe of the Ieſſe, and the knotte at the end, whereby you tye the hawke.</p>
               <p>She ſhould alſo haue twoo good belles, whereby ſhe may be the better heard. For commonly when a Sparowhawke ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth any prey, ſhée will carrie it into ſome thicke buſh to féede thereon in ſuch ſort, that ſhée cannot lightly be eyther heard or ſéene, and whiles ſhée plumeth it, the plumage doth often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times couer both her eyes, or one of them, then to take away the ſayd plumage, ſhée ſtraineth with one of her feet, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by her belles diſcouer her. Therefore if ſhee had but one bel, ſhe might happen to ſcratte with that foot which lacketh the bell, and ſo ſhould not be heard. The Sparowhawks which are wonted to be hooded, and which will gently brooke it, are much better than they which wil not be hooded. For they bate leſſe, and are with more eaſe borne in the raine, or any euill weather. For béeing hooded, the Falconer may hide and couor
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:28166:50"/>
them with his cloke, which he cannot do to the other. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, they ſhall bée able to flée better and more ſtrongly, that are good weather Hawkes, for they ſhall be leſſe bruiſed than a Hawke which is not hooded, which will weary her ſelfe with bating, &amp; withall a man may the better flée with them at ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage, becauſe they bate not, but onely when you would haue them to flée, whereby they haue the greater courage, and alſo a man may beare them in all places, without bating or beating themſelues out of breath.</p>

               <head>How a man ſhould manne a Sparow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawke, and make her fleeing.</head>
               <p>FOr as much as Sparowhawkes are of ſundry ſortes of plumes, and ſundry ſhapes and proportions, there are alſo ſundry manners of manning them and making them, and there is much leſſe paines to bée taken with ſome one, than with ſome other. For the more eager and ſharper ſet that a Sparowhawke is, the fooner ſhall you winne her, and man her.</p>
               <p>Firſt to winne her to féede, rubbe her féete with warme fleſh, chirping and wiſtling to her, and ſometimes preſent the fleſh vnto her beake, and if ſhée will not yet féed, rub her féet with a quick birde, and the birde will crye, and if the Sparowhawke doe ſeaze it with her féet, it is a token that ſhée will féede. Then teare off the skinne and feathers of the birdes breaſt, and offer it to the Hawkes beake, and ſhée will taſte thereof. For a Sparowhawke which féedeth immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly after ſhée bée taken, doth ſhew that ſhée is eager, and hath good appetite. And you may giue her as much more at eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, yea and ſometimes in the day time, ſo that ſhée be not gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged firſt, but that ſhée haue put ouer her meat. When ſhée is thus well entred, &amp; will féed when you chirpe or wiſtle to her,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:28166:50"/>
then may you hood her with an hood that is large &amp; déep inough, ſo that it neyther hurt nor touch her eyes when ſhe will indure to be hooded and vnhooded, without bating, &amp; that thée will feede hooded, then muſt you abate her meals, giuing her leſſe meate, and féede her betimes in the morning when ſhe hath endewed, (that is to ſay, when ſhée ſhall haue put ouer her meate, ſo as there remayneth nothing in her gorge,) then may you giue her a beaching in the day time, taking off, and putting on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine her hoode, to make her the more eager. For it will not bée amiſſe, to giue her a bitte or two of meate euery time that you hood her. When it is euening then ſup her vp, giuing her the head or braines of a hen or pullet vntill the morning. And if you perceiue that ſhée is become very eager, then looſe the threade wherewith ſhée is ſéeled, but let it be night firſt, and that ſhée haue ſéene backwards as before ſayd.</p>
               <p>If ſhée may abide Companie, yet watch her all that night that you vnſeele her, to the end ſhée may alſo be accuſtomed to heare people ſpeake, and be acquanted with them, and when you hoode her againe, giue her two or thrée bittes of meate. In the morning betimes, put a birde in her foote, whome if ſhée ſeaze hardilye, and plume thereon eagerly, then may you boldely take off her hoode, but if ſhée bate them, hoode her againe, and watch her vntill ſhée bée thorowly wonne and manned: but if ſhée féede well before company, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come familiar and quiet before them, watch her no longer, but kéepe her on the fiſt ſome part of the night amongſt company, making her to plume, giuing her now and then a bitte or two of fleſh, and putting her hoode on and off there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall.</p>
               <p>When you goe to bed, ſet your Hawke neare to your beddes head vpon ſome treſtle or ſtoole, that you may wake her ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the night. Then riſe before day, &amp; take her vpon your fiſt, &amp; off with her hoode, that ſhée may ſée the people about her, &amp; when ſhée beholdeth them, put a quick birde in her foote, as before ſayd. When ſhée féedeth thereupon, hood her againe, giuing her
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:28166:51"/>
the reſt of your bird hooded, and when it is further foorth day, you may looke whether ſhée haue any thing in her gorge, or not. If ſhee haue nothing aboue, giue her ſome little beaching, and beach her oftentimes before company, hooding and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooding her. But at night ſhe ſhould be alwayes vnhooded, that ſhée may ſee people, and become acquainted with them, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing her to féede of a Hen or Pullet. To heale the places where ſhée was ſeeled, to the end thée may ſée the better: when thou goeſt to bed, holde her in a darke corner, &amp; ſpirt a little Water vpon her head, that ſhée may frote her eyes againſt the pini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of her wings. Then in the morning when ſhée perceyueth the day light, and hath warme meate ready vpon your fiſte, and is cleane looſed that ſhee may ſée both before, and behind her, and ſéemeth to bée familiar and bolde amongſt people, then may you make her as before ſayd. But remember that you giue her no plumage that day, in which you haue giuen her waſht meat, yea and allow her no plumage vntill ſhée bée well manned. For vntill ſhée bée throughly manned, ſhée will not dare to caſt. Then if you would throughly manne your Sparowhawke, and kéepe her eager, take her earely in the morning vpon your fiſt, and goe into ſome place where no body ſhall interrupt you, where firſt cauſe her to plume with her beake vpon ſome quicke bird, then vnſeaze her, and ſet her vpon ſome thing, and reach her your hand, and ſhew her your fiſte, giuing her a bitte or two thereof. And if ſhée come there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto willingly, then call her againe morning and euening, further and further off, but euer before company, to acquaint her the better with them, faſtning a long line or cryance vnto her limmes: if it be fayre weather, and that the Sunne ſhine, you ſhould then proffer her the water, to the end ſhée may bathe her. Prouided alwayes in ſo doing that ſhée bee ſound, well manned, and that ſhe be not poore nor gorged. For ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is a thing which maketh a Hawke familiar and luſtye. But reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber that alwayes after ſhée hath bathed, you giue her ſome liue birde to féede on, and alwayes when you call her
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:28166:51"/>
or féed her, you muſt chirpe with your mouth, or whiſtle, to the end ſhée may become acquainted with your whiſtle, and come therevnto. You muſt féed her amongſt horſes and dogs, to make her alſo the better acquainted with them. If ſhée haue flowen, and you would ſet her in the Sunne to weather, ſet her vpon the ground on ſome cudgell or truncheon, making her faſt, and ſhee will alwaies loue the better to ſit vppon the ground. After ſhée hath bathed, if you perceiue your Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowhawke luſty, you may flée with her the next day towards the euening, but firſt you muſt haue reclaimed her to come out of a trée, and called her to you ſitting on horſebacke, béeing alwayes prouided of ſome Pigeon, or other quicke thing, to take her downe the more eaſily. For before a man flee with a Sparrowhawke, ſhée would be throughly well reclaymed by watching, carrying, féeding and plumming before people, that ſhee loue her kéepers fiſt, and his countenance, that ſhée can abide both horſes and dogges, that ſhee be cleane within, as well ſkowred with waſhtmeate, as alſo with plumage, and that ſhée bée ſharpe ſet, and well comming, as well from the pearch, as from off the ground, or out of a trée.

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:28166:52"/>
flée in the morning) dooth much trouble the Hawke, and rayſeth and ſtirreth her courage, making her prowde and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage. So that ſhée léeſeth the eagerneſſe of her appetite, and remembreth it not, thinking on nothing elſe but to ſoare and gadde abroade, whereby ſhe may be eaſily loſt. Furthermore, towards the euening, ſhe cannot ſoare ſo far away from you, (although thee ſhould ſoare) as ſhe would do in the heat of the day, becauſe the night will enforce her to goe to the pearch and ſtand. Alſo to enter your Sparrowhawke, it ſhall be beſt to ſeeke out ſome Champion Country, farre from the woodes, and let her bée vnhooded when the Spaniels bée vncoupled, then if the Partridge ſpring, and ſhée bate, caſt her off, if they ſpring neare you. And if ſhe kill, reward her vpon the ground, of the head, braines, necke, and breaſt of the Partridge. When ſhee hath fed, take it from her, and vnſeaze her, and get vppon your horſe a good way from her. Then whiſtle and call her, and if ſhée come vnto you, reward her better. Aboue all things, you muſt take good héed that ſhée fayle not her firſt flight at great birdes, leaſt ſhée turne tayle and accuſtome her ſelfe to ſmaller game. But if ſhée be once well entred at great game, you may quickly make her flee Larkes and ſmall birdes. If you find that ſhée haue moſt mind to flée Larkes, let her flée them, and reward her on them. For there is no flight pleaſanter than the flight of the Sparrowhawke at the Larke. And foraſmuch as the fleſh and bloud of Larkes is hotte and burning, it ſhall be good when you flée the Larke, to giue your Hawke waſht meate twice in a wéeke, and plumage very often. But giue her no plumage that day that ſhée hath waſht meate, nor the day that ſhée batheth. When there is a knotte of good company mette together, and euery man hath his Sparrowhawke, if one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſee his Sparrowhawke flée when another is alſo from the fiſt, there beginneth the paſtime, &amp; yet they may flée together. But it is a pleaſure to take a Larke towring or clyming. Or if a Sparowhawke haue beaten down a Larke, or that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Larke be

Then the Larke had rather flée for ſuccour betwéene the legges of the men and the Horſes, than to fall in the tallons of her naturall enemy: yet commonly ſhee is there taken alſo. He that would learne to make a Falcon well, let him beginne with a Hobby, and he that would make the Gerfalcon fléeing, let him acquaint himſelfe with the Merlyn.

For ſhee is better content when ſhée ſeeth the meat plainly before her, than if ſhee ſawe it ſidewayes, or looking backe. And ſhee ſhould not bée ſéeled too ſtraight, neither yet ought the thréed wherewith ſhée is ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, be ouerſtraight bound or knit about her head, but twiſted and twyrled together.</p>
               <p>A Hawke newly taken, ſhould haue new furniture, as new Ieſſes, Leaſſe, and Bewets, all of good leather, and the Ieſſes, mayled, and the Leaſe mad with a button at the end. Then muſt you haue a little round ſticke hanging in a little ſtring, with the which you ſhall oftentimes ſtroke and handle your Falcon. For the more ſhée is handled, the better ſhée will bée manned, and become the gentlier, and the more familiar: and alſo if you ſhould ſtroke or handle her with your hand, you might chance to catch a knappe of her beake now and then. Shée muſt haue two good belles, to the end ſhée may the better be found and heard when ſhée ſtirreth or ſcratteth.

ſhée be full gorged twice a day for thrée dayes. For you muſt not breake her of her accuſtomed dyet all at once, and being lately taken, ſhee will more willingly féede on warme meats, than any thing elſe. When you féede her, you muſt whoope and lewre as you doe when you call a hawke, that ſhée may know when you will giue her meat. You muſt vnhoode her gently, giuing her two or thrée bittes, and putting on her hood againe, you muſt giue her as much more. But take héed that ſhée bée well and cloſe ſéeled: three dayes being paſſed, if you perceiue her to be eager and gréedy of meat, and that ſhée fée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth with good appetite, then beginne to abate her her meat, that is to ſay, giue her but little at once, and often, ſo that ſhée haue not much aboue at one time, vntill it be Euening, and beare her late vppon your fiſt before you goe to bedde, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her vppon a treſtle or ſtoole very neare you, ſo that you may wake her often in the night. Afterwards you ſhould take her on your fiſt againe before day, with ſome quicke bird or ſuch like meate: and when you haue obſerued this order with her two or thrée nights, and that you perceiue ſhée beginnes to bee much better fellow than ſhée was woont, and that ſhée ſéemeth to beginne to bée reclaymed, and fée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth eagerly vppon good meate, then beginne to change her di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, giuing her often, and little at once, the heart of an Hogge or a Shéepe. In the Euening when it beginnes to bee late, (without caſting of her) lette her féeling thread a little looſe, ſpowting water on her face, that ſhee may ieouke the leſſe, and watching her all the night, hold her vppon your fiſte vnhooded. But if ſhée ſée any thing that miſlikes her, and make ſemblance to bee afeard, then let her bee car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed into ſome darke place, where you haue no more but light to hoode her againe.

               <p>And becauſe there be ſundry Falcons of ſundry ſortes and conditions, as ſome mewed at large in the Woodes, ſome other taken at ſtand, where they haue long vſed, and ſome other taken ſoare Hawkes (whereof we now treate) whether they be Soare-hawkes, Mewed, or Nyaſſe, yet are they of ſundry natures and properties, and therfore they muſt be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſly gouerned and entred, which is the cauſe that it is hard to giue generall Rules. For thoſe which are Gentle, eaſie to be reclaymed, and of a good kind and nature, ought alſo to bée the more fauoured, and the more gently handled. But when your Hawke is brought to the poynt before rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as well for the hooding, as alſo for her eagerneſſe to féede, if you peceiue that ſhee beginne to be acquainted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, you may vnhoode her by day time, farre from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, firſt giuing her a bitte or two of good meate.

               <p>Aboue all thinges you muſt beware to hoode or vnhoode her in any place where ſhee may bée frayed, for that were able to marre her at the firſt. When ſhée beginneth to bee acquainted with Companye, if you perceiue that ſhee bée eager or ſharpe ſet, vnhoode her, and giue her a bitte or two of meate, holding her right againſt your face and countenance. For that will cauſe her to dread no company. And when it is night, cut the thread wherewith ſhée is ſeeled, and you ſhall not néede to watch her, if you perceiue her bold inough a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt company. But yet let her be ſet vpon a treſtle by you, that you may awake her two or three times in the night, and take her on your fiſt before day.

               <p>You muſt take good héede how you giue your Hawke any Feathers, vntill ſhée be throughly reclaymed. For vntill ſhée be throughly wonne and reclaymed, ſhée dares not caſt vppon the fiſt. And on the fiſt you muſt beare her continually, till ſhée be throughly manned. But when ſhe makes ſemblance to caſt, vnhood her gently by the taſſell of the hoode.</p>
               <p>You may giue her two dayes waſht meat, and the third day plumage, according as ſhée is cleane or fowle within. And when ſhée hath caſt, then hoode her againe, giuing her nothing to feed on, vntill ſhe gleame after her caſting. But when ſhée hath caſt and gleamed, then giue her a beaching of hote meat, in company giuing her two or thrée bittes at once: and at euening make her plume a hennes wing in company alſo.</p>
               <p>When you find her well reclaimed, and throughly manned, and eager, and ſharpe ſet, then it is time to féed her vppon the lure.</p>
               <p>And you muſt marke whether the feathers of your Hawkes caſting bée fowle or ſlimie, and whether the ſlime thereof bée

For if they bee, you muſt bee very circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to make her cleane with waſht meat and caſting, and if ſhee be cleane within, then giue her not ſo ſtrong caſtings as Hares feet or Conies feet: but giue her the Pynions of an old Hennes wing, or the plumage that is to bee taken there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon, or the necke bone chopped foure or fiue times betweene the ioyntes, waſhed and ſteeped in faire water. To make an end of this Chapter, it is certaine that it requireth more time to winne and to watch a Falcon once mewed in the woode, then one which is taken ſore at paſſage.

                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:28166:58"/>BEfore you ſhew the lure to a Falcon newly reclaimed, you muſt conſider three things. Firſt, that ſhe be well aſſured, and boldned in Company, well acquainted alſo with dogges, and with horſes. Secondarily, that ſhee be ſharpe ſet, and eager, hauing regard to the howre of the morning or euening when you will lure her. And the third conſideration is, that ſhee bée cleane within, the lure muſt be well garniſhed with meate on both ſides, and you muſt be a part in ſome ſecret place when you would giue her the length of the leaſe. You muſt firſt vnhoode her, giuing her a bitte or twaine vpon the lure as ſhe ſitteth on your fiſt, afterwards take the lure from her, and hyde it that ſhée ſée it not, and when ſhée is vnſeazed, caſt the lure ſo neare her that ſhe may catch it within the length of her leaſe, and if ſhée doe ſeaze vpon it, then ſhall you vſe the voyce and accuſtomed ſpéech of a Falconer vnto his Hawke, and féed her vpon the lure on the ground, giuing her thervpon the warm thigh of a Henne or Pullet, and the heart alſo.</p>
               <p>When you haue ſo lured her at Euening, giue her but a little meat, and let her be lured ſo timely, that when ſhée is therewith accuſtomed, you may giue her plumage, and a iucke of a ioynt. Afterwards, and in the morning betimes, take her on your fiſt, and when ſhe hath caſt and gleamed, giue her a little beaching of good warme meat. Afterwards, when the day is further forwards, and that it is time to féede her, take a Criance and tye it to her leaſe, and goe into ſome faire pleaſant meadow, and giue her a bitte or two vpon the lure, as before ſayd, then vnſeaze her, and if you peceiue that ſhe be ſharpe ſet, &amp; haue ſeaſed vpon the lure eagerly, then giue her to hold vnto ſome man which may let her off to the lure, then ſhall you vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind the Criance, and draw it after you a good way, and hée which holdeth the Hawke, muſt hold his right hand on the Taſſell of the Hawkes hoode in a readineſſe, that hée may vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:28166:58"/>
her as ſoone as you beginne to lure, and if ſhée come well to the lure, and ſtoope vppon it roundly, and ſeaze it ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly, then let her feede two or three bittes vppon it, and then vnſeaze her and take her from off the lure, and hoode her, and then deliuer her againe to him which held her, and goe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther off and lure her, féeding her alwayes vpon the lure on the ground, and vſing the familiar voyce of Falconers as they cry when they lure. And thus you ſhall lure her euery day further and further off, vntill ſhe be well taught to come to the lure, &amp; to take it eagerly.</p>
               <p>Afterwardes let her be lured in company, hauing regard that neither dogs nor other thing come in ſodainly to fray her, and when you take her vppe from the ground, hoode her vpon the lure, and when you haue well and often lured her on foote, then vſe to lure her on horſebacke: the which you ſhall the eaſſier winne her too, if when you lure her on foote, you cauſe ſome on horſebacke to come neare you, that ſhée may ſee them, and cauſe them to come neare her when ſhée féedeth vppon the lure, cauſing them alſo to turne and toſſe their horſes about her, but let their horſes be ruly, leaſt they ſhould vpon the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine affright her.</p>
               <p>Furthermore the better to acquaint her with Horſes, and that ſhée may the better know them, carrie your Falcon (whiles ſhée feedeth) on high vppon the lure neare vnto ſome man on Horſebacke, or gette your ſelfe vppe on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe, and reward her vppon the lure amongſt Horſemen, and when ſhée is well accuſtomed to them, and well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with them, making no reſemblance to feare them, you may then lure her on horſebacke in this manner: Hée which holdeth her to let her come to the Lure, muſt be on foote, and you where you Lure ſhall bée on Horſe-backe, and when you call and caſt the Lure about your head, then hee which holdeth her, ſhall take off her hood by the taſſell, and you the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:28166:59"/>
meane while ſhall call and lure in the cunningeſt wiſe you can, as Falconers vſe to doe: and if ſhée ſeare eagerly vppon the lure, and feare neither people nor horſes, then take off the luring line or Creance, and lure her looſe further and further off. And to make a Falcon come which is but newly reclay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and to make her come in company of another Hawke, there muſt bee two to hold a caſt of Falcons, and two which ſhall lure them, but hee which holdeth the Falcon that is but lately lured, ſhall not let her come ſo ſoone as the other ſhall do: then ſhall the lure bee throwen out vnto the Falcon which is but lately lured, and when ſhee is fallen therevpon, her keeper ſhall carry her vppon the lure, to féede amongſt the other make Hawkes. This being done twice or thrice, ſhée will follow them and loue them, and if you would haue her loue dogges, which is moſt neceſſary, you muſt call dogges about you when you féed her, or giue her tyring or plumage.</p>

vp vpon ſome high place or banke, and there hold her in the ſun vntill ſhe haue endued her gorge, taking off her hood, that ſhée may proyne and picke her ſelfe: that being doone, hood her again, and ſet her neare to the baſon, afterwards taking off her hood againe (if ſhée will) let her leape downe into the Baſon or vpon the graſſe by it, and to make her know the water, ſlappe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in with a little wand, and let her bath therein as long as ſhée lift: when ſhee commeth out of the Water, take ſome meat in thy hand, and proffer it vnto her, and be well ware that ſhée come not out before thou proffer her thy fiſte to giue her a bitte or twaine, then take her vp, and hold her in the ſunne, and ſhe will picke and proyne her on your ſiſt, or vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon your knée; if ſhée will not bath her in a baſon, then proffer her to bath in riuer water at ſome foorde. Bathing giueth an Hawke great courage, much boldneſſe, and eager appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite: that day that ſhée batheth, giue her no waſht meat. To make a new lured Falcon, and to make her vpwardes, the morrow after ſhée hath bathed, get on horſebacke in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or in the euening, when ſhe is ſharpe ſet, and chooſe out ſome field or paſture, where feweſt doues or choughes bée, then take your lure well garniſhed on both ſides, and hauing vnhooded your Hawke, giue her a bitte or twaine vppon the lure, then taking it away for her, hoode her againe, then going fayre and ſoftly againſt the wind, vnhoode her: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe bate or find any checke in her eye, whiſtle her from off your fiſt fayre and gently, and when ſhée flyeth about, (trot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forwards with your horſe) caſt out your lure, and ſuffer her not long to flée about you at the firſt. Continue this both morning and euening for a few dayes, and if you perceiue that your Hawke haue no great liſt to flée about you, nor to ſtoope to the lure, and that ſhée maketh no ſemblance to loue other Hawkes, then muſt you make her flée with one which loueth other Hawkes, and which will not gadde out to any change or checke: and that muſt firſt be done at the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge, for they flée not farre before an Hawke: and if your

               <p>If you flée to the Riuer with your Falcon, and that the flight be fayre and likely to be landed, ſtaye and draw vnder the wind, and taking off your Hawkes hoode, caſt her off with the reſt. When you would haue your Hawke proue vpwards and a high flying Hawke, you muſt let her flée with a very high fléeing Hawke, but ſée that your Hawke be well taught to hold in the head, and that ſhée loue well to flée with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hawkes, and if the fowle be in a poole, or on a pitte or plaſh, you muſt firſt caſt off the high fleeing hawke, and hee which holdeth your new lured hawke, ſhall doe well to gette him vnder the wind, and when hee ſéeth his vantage let him vnhoode her, and if ſhee bate then, it is to get vppe to the other Hawke. Then let him caſt her off, and ſhe will clime againſt the wind right vnto the high fleeing Hawke, and before ſhee weary her ſelfe too much with clyming to reach or couer that other Hawke, lay out the fowle, when the high fleeing hawke ſhall be at her pitch, and lay them out behind her, if ſhe kill the fowle, then giue your Hawke reward of the Heart and the breaſt with the other Hawks. If your hawke goe out to any checke, and kill a Doue or a Crow, or any other checke and feed vppon it, or haue fedde vppon it before you come at her, ſeeme not roughly to rebuke her at firſt, but take her downe to the lure, giuing her a bitte of meat, and hood her vppe, and flee not with her in two or three dayes after, but when you doe flee, flee as neare as you can where there be no checke, but if by no meanes you can keepe her from checking and going out, then for your laſt remedy, doe as followeth.

               <p>SOme Falcons be harder bo enſeame, than ſome others are, or the longer that a Falcon hath béene in the hand, the harder ſhée is to be enſeamed: and an old mewed Falcon of the wood, which hath mewed but one cote in the Falconers handes, is much eaſier to be enſeamed, than a yonger Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con which hath béene longer in the Falconers handes: the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, becauſe a Hawke which preyeth for her ſelfe, doth féede cleaner, and better, according to her nature, and vpon more holeſome meates, than ſhée doth when ſhée is in mans handes, ſo that it is no maruaile though ſhée bee not ſo fowle within when ſhée is at her owne dyet, as when another man féedeth her. For a Hawke which is in our kéeping doth féede gréedily both on skinne, feathers, and all that comes to hand. Neyther is ſhée mewed with ſo cleane and holeſome féeding, nor doth endue her meate ſo well, nor hath ſuch open ayre at times conuenient as a Hawke which is at large to prey for her ſelfe. When you draw your Hawke out of the mew, if ſhée bee greaſſe (the which you ſhall know by her thighes if they be round and fatte, and alſo by her body if ſhée bée full in the hand, and that her fleſh bée round as hie as her breaſt bone) and if ſhée be well mewed, and haue all her feathers full ſommed, then giue her when ſhée woulde féede in the Morning a bitte or two of hote meate,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:28166:63"/>
and at night giue her but a little, vnleſſe it bee very colde, and if ſhée feed well without conſtraint or forcing thereunto, then giue her waſht meate thus prepared: take the wings of a Henne or Pullet for her dinner, and waſh them in two wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and if you giue her Hares fleſh or Beefe, let it be waſht in three waters, on the morrow giue her the legge of a Henne very hote, and at noone meate temperately warme, a good gorge, then let her faſt vntill it be late in the euening, and if ſhée haue put ouer her meate and that there be nothing left in her gorge, then giue her a little warme meate, as you did in the morning, and let her thus be dyetted vntyll it bee time to giue her plumage, the which you ſhall know by three tokens, the firſt is, that feeling the end of the pinion of the Hawkes wing, you ſhall féele the fleſh as it were tenderer, and ſofter than it was before ſhe eate waſht meate: the ſecond, if her mewets bée cleane and white, and that the blacke of the mewt be right blacke, and not mingled with any other fowle thing and colour: the thirde token is, if ſhée be very ſharpe ſet and do plume eagerly, you may giue her caſting either of a Hares foote or a Conies foote, or of the ſmall feathers, which are on the ioynt of the pinyon of an olde Hennes wing: take then the forefoote of an Hare, and beate it with the backe of a knife vntill the bones and clawes doe fall out, becauſe the ſmall bones may mouldre and bee all to fruſhed to pieces, the which you ſhall afterwardes cut and lay it in fayre freſh water, then wring it and giue her it at two morſells, and when you ſet her on the pearch, ſweepe cleane vnderneath it that you may ſee whether the mewte bée full of ſtrakes or skinnes, or not, and whether it be full of ſlime and ordure or not, and if it bée, then continue this kinde of caſting thrée or foure nights together with waſht meat, as is before ſayd, and if you perceiue the feathers digeſted and ſoft, and that her caſting be great and full of ordure, then take the necke of an olde Henne, and cutte it all alongſt betweene the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:28166:63"/>
ioynts, and lay the ioynts in cleare cold water, and giue it to your Falcon without any other thing: and this is done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it beareth downe before it into the pannell, the meate which is vpon the ioynts, and there in the pannell the fleſh conſumeth, and the bones remayne ſharpe &amp; pricking, which break the kels and skins, and the groſſe ordure, and bear them with them: and giue her ſo three nights together, giuing her by day waſht meate as is before rehearſed, &amp; afterwardes giue her caſting or plumage againe, according as her ſtate doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. And thinke it not ſtrange that a Falcon which is to bée enſeamed, is ſometimes a fortnight or more before ſhée wil take caſting: neyther yet that ſome Falcons will eaſlier be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeamed in a month, than ſome other in fiue wéekes, according as they be ſtronger or weaker of nature, and fedde with clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner or fowler meates, or according as they haue béene ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or longer time in mens handes and kéeping.

And in the euening when day light beginneth to fayle, take off her hoode amongſt companye of people by the candle light, vntill ſhe rowze and mewte, &amp; then ſet her on the pearch and not before, and ſet light before her, and when ſhée is well wonne to know the fiſt, then beginne to make her know the lure, and ſo by little and little reclayme her, vntyll you may call her looſe without Cryance. Euerye Falcon hath néede of a make hawke to teach her to holde in the head, and eſpecially the Haggart Falcon, the which may be peraduenture an Hag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gart of two or thrée Cotes, &amp; yet ſhall be the better Hearoner: but if a Haggart mewed will not holde in the head, then cutte off ſome part of her two princypalles in each wing, the long feather, and that which is next to it, and that ſhall force her to hold in. You muſt alſo feat her beake, &amp; cope her reaſonably. They alwayes giue their Hawkes tyring both morning and euening, but the Falconers of the Eaſt parts are of a contrarye opinion, and ſay that it weakeneth a Hawkes backe. If you would make your hawke vpwards, or high fléeing, then after ſhée is reclaymed and lured, and ready comming, when you lure her, and that ſhée commeth towards you, ſtoope the lure vpon her, and let her paſſe by you, and when ſhe retourneth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you, throw her out the lure, and make much of her, and do thus oftentimes vntill you may ſuffer her to flee longer about you, and to get vp higher, the which you muſt doe in a plaine field where no wood or trées are: &amp; if ſhée get vp to any pitch, then let her flée a turne or two of iollity, and when ſhée is at the higheſt, and right ouer you, throw her forth the lure, or a Pigeon or Pullet, and giue her a good gorge thereon,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:28166:65"/>
making the moſt of her that you can deuiſe, and take héede that you caſt not your lure into the water, leaſt ſhée ſhould thereby be rebuked. And when ſhe is at her gate, if percaſe ſhe gadde out after ſome check, and kill it, then take the prey from her angarly, and beate her therewith about the head, and hoode her vp without any reward: and hereby ſhee will the leſſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to rake out after a check. When your hawke hath kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a fowle, take it out of her foot, and caſt her vp againe, and when ſhée is right ouer you, caſt out the lure, and féede her vp vpon it, to make her loue the lure the better. But at the beginning reward her and féede her well vpon the quarry, and that ſhall encourage her and kéepe her from going out to the checke. When ſhee is well in blood, and well quarried, then let her flée with other hawkes, vntill ſhée be well acquainted and invred.</p>
               <p>If you would make your Hawk to the Crane, take an Ny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſe Falcon gentle, and in entring of her, let her kill the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt fowle that you can find. Her lure ſhould alſo be a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfaite Crane. And when you would make her fléeing, lette her flée from the fiſte, and ſuccour her quickly. For you muſt haue dogges made for the purpoſe, which may helpe and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour her ſooner then a man can doe. And let ſuch dogges féede alwayes with your hawke, to make them the better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted. If you would make a Falcon to the hare, her lure ſhould be then a Hares skinne ſtuffed with ſtrawe, and when ſhée is well lured, and that you would enter her, tie the ſayde Hares ſkinne to the end of a cryance, and faſten it to your ſaddle pummell, and when you gallope it will bee like vnto a running Hare. Then vnhoode your Hawke, and cry, Backe with the Greyhounds, backe with the Greyhoundes. And when your Hawke commeth to ſeaze the ſayde Hares skinne, let goe hour cryance, and ſuffer her to take it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward her well vpon it, and make the moſt of her that you can deuiſe. And when you go about to enter her the ſecond time, let not ſlippe your cryance at the firſte, but rather pull it from her
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:28166:66"/>
by force, and afterwards let her ſeaze vpon it, and ſo by little and little you ſhall teach her to beate it and ſtoope at it. For ſo muſt ſhe doe at a wild Hare. And you muſt feede her alwayes amongſt the dogges, and when ſhe is well nouſled and entred in this manner, take a liue Hare, and breake one of her hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der legs, and let her goe in ſome faire place amongſt your dogs, and your Falcon will ſtoope her and ruffe her, vntill the dogs may take her. Then take her from the dogs, and caſt her out vnto the hawke, and cry backe, backe.</p>
               <p>If you would make your Hawke fleeing to the Partridge, or Feaſant, when ſhe is reclaymed and made, then euery time that you lure her, caſt your lure into ſome low tree or buſh, that ſhe may learne to take the trée or the ſtand. And if ſhée take the ſtand before ſhée eſpie the lure, let her ſtand a while. And after draw the lure out before her and cry, <hi>Loe birde, lo, Hey lo bird, hey lo,</hi> and rewarde her well. For in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſhée will learne to take ſtand. But feede her alwayes on the ground, and in ſome thicke place, for in ſuch places ſhee muſt encounter with the Feſant at Pearch. And at the firſt flée with her at Feaſant, or Partridge that be young, to giue her the aduantage, and afterwardes at the old. If a Falcon will not take ſtand, but will kéepe her on wing, then muſt you flée with her in plaine places, where you may alwayes ſée her vpon you. Sacres and Laners will commonly take ſtand both in a trée, and on the ground, but the Falcon gentle taketh ſtand more willingly vpon the ground. And when you draw a Hawke out of the mew, bear her not much in hot weather, for feare leaſt by much bating in heate, ſhée may get the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe. But if there be no remedy, then kéepe her alwayes hooded, and take as good héede to her as you can. If your Hawke be coy and dangerous, then giue her ſalt with her meat, I meane a dramme of the ſalt called <hi>Sal Inde,</hi> or <hi>Sal ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,</hi> or <hi>Salis albi pulverizati,</hi> and giue her water, for ſhée ſhall haue néede thereof. And make her Ieouke all night in payne, &amp;
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:28166:66"/>
in a moyſt or colde place, and ſo ſhall ſhée watch moſt of the night, and thereby her greaſe and pride will be abated. Sacres muſt be nouſled and entred as ſoone as they be manned, for elſe they be very hard to be entred. Draw your Hawke out of the mew twenty dayes before you enſeame her. If a Falcon truſſe and carrye, to remedy the ſame, you muſt cope her tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons, her powlſe, and her petty ſinggle. Neuer reward your hawke vpon riuer fowle, but reward her, and make much of her vpon the lure, to the end ſhée may the better know it, and eſtéeme it. The Souldan fléeth to the Crane, wilde Gooſe, &amp; Buſtard, with thrée or foure Hawkes at once, (or more) from the fiſte, yea and thoſe of all kind of Hawkes alſo, as Sacres, Gerfalcons, peregrine Falcons, and Mylanes. And ofter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a man may make them flée to the mowntye. You ſhould flée to the Crane before Sunne riſing, for ſhée is ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh and ſlothfull, and you may caſt off to her a caſte or a leaſe of Falcons, or you may hawke to her with the Goſhawke from the fiſt without dogs. Wilde Géeſe are flowen to in the ſame manner. And if you haue dogs to helpe and ſuccour your hawkes, ſée that they be ſtanch and gentle, and well made for the purpoſe, and a Greyhound will be moſt readily made ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. You ſhall flée but once in a day at the Crane, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon reward her liberally, and make as much of her as you can. The Millaine ſhould be let flée downe the wind. The Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines doe flee at the Pye with a leaſe or two caſt of Falcons at once, and they make them to mount and to ſtoope, as they doe at the Riuer. But this muſt be in a playne, where there be no trées nor wood, but little ſhrubbs and buſhes. If you vſe to giue your hawke a breakefaſt or beaching very timely in the morning, it will make her eager to flee at ſuch time as will be conuenient for her to flee. And eſpecially a Falcon which you would haue high fleeing, &amp; thoſe ſhould not be highly kept, but ſhould be fed nyne dayes together before Sunne riſing, and at night late in the freſh or coole of the Euening. So ſhall
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:28166:67"/>
you make them high fléeing, &amp; by that means they will euery day get gate higher and higher, ſo that they bee flowen with euermore in the plaine champion. The Falcon gentle is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly better inward when ſhée hath mewed, than in her ſoarage. The Falcon will kill the Hearon naturally, if ſhée be a peregrine Falcon, and yet you ſhall doe well to giue them traines. A Falcon may flee ten ſlights at riuer in one day, if the ſeaſon be not extreame, and that is the moſt that you ſhall flée with her. The Falcons which are riuer Hawkes, ſhould alwayes be borne vpon the fiſte. A hawke ſhall haue forty ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtings before ſhee be perfectly made. For a hawke which hath not caſting euery night, will be ſurcharged with abundance and ſuperfluity of humors, the which doe (from the ſtomake) ſo ouerflow their braine, that they cannot flée ſo high as elſe they would doe. And therefore all hawkes ſhould haue caſting euery night naturally, if you would haue them ſounde and cleane: and it is good to giue them tyring or plumage at night, eſpecially field hawkes, but not riuer hawkes, for weakening their backes. And euery third day you ſhall preſent them to the water at the longeſt. Touch your Hawks feathers as little as you can, for much handling will make them out of order. The Millaine and the Laneret may bée ſet vppon the ſtone incontiuently, as ſoone as they be made. When your hawke hath flowen or bated, féede her not as long as ſhée panteth, or bloweth, nor vntill ſhée be in breath againe. For if you ſhould, it is perilous to bring her into the diſeaſe called <hi>Aſtum,</hi> and (in a Hawke) the Pantiſe. If a hawke (eyther Falcon, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) chance to be out of heart, and diſcouraged, (which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth oftentimes) then take ſuch paines with her, that ſhée may kill ſome prey, and féede her vpon it with a full gorge euen as long as ſhée will eate, and the ſame night ſette her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade that ſhée may Ieouke in the open ayre at her owne plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: and on the morrow take her and féede her with ſmall birdes to enſeame her, neyther more nor leſſe than you would doe with an Hawke that were new drawne out of the mew.
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:28166:67"/>
If a Falcon or other hawke will not ſeaze or gorge, take the quill of a wilde Gooſes feather, and tye it vnder her long ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, and ſhee will ſeaze and gripe. And when ſhe beginneth to ſeaze, take away the ſayd quill, and ſhee will ſeaze long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes. If you cannot giue couert to your Falcon, or your Goſhawke, then caſt her off with the Sunne in her back. All hawkes may be made flee at the ſowrce or ſpring. But in what ſort ſoeuer you flée with your Goſhawke, let her haue the Sunne in her backe.</p>

Now to enter your hawke at any of them, make a little pit or hole in the ground, and put your traine therein. Then couer the hole with a little borde or ſod of earth, to the which you ſhall faſten to a ſmall cryance or corde, and that you ſhall holde in your hande to drawe away when you liſt. Then you ſhall make as though you vncou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled your ſpaniels to hunt and put vp y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> game, and you ſhall carry your hawke vnhooded. And when you perceiue that your hawke looketh that way where you haue layd the traine, then drawe off the borde, and cauſe the traine to ſpringe as though the ſpanels had ſprong it. And if your hawke doe take it, let her féede thereon her fill vpon the ground. And thus muſt you doe ſundry times. If you would haue a good hawke, then nowſle her yong, for ſo will ſhée encreaſe her force by little and little, and in the end, ſhee will ouercome both Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and Partridge, &amp;c. And when ſhée hath killed, let her gripe and ſeaze the prey at her pleaſure. And let her alſo plume thereupon ſo long as ſhée will, &amp; euermore let her bée re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded vpon the ground. And when ſhee is well nouſled, then reward her neuer but vpon the cockes of all preyes, becauſe that will make her loue that prey the better. And when ſhée killeth a hen of any kind, let her no more but plume vpon it, &amp;
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:28166:68"/>
giue her but the heart, and the brayne at the moſt, becauſe ſhée ſhall not loue to flée the Henne ſo well as the cocke. It is much better to nouſle hawkes at yong fowles, than at the olde. For moſt commonly if a yong hawke bée let flee at olde game, ſhee will turne tayle, end cowardly giue it ouer, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe you doe as before is declared.

In 9. nightes he ſhould not ſuffer her to ieouke at all, nor to come on any pearch, but ſhould keepe her continually ſo long vpon his fiſt. And when he will call her, let him obſerue this order: Set the Falcon vpon the pearch and vnhoode her, then ſhew her your fiſte with ſome meate in it, and call her ſo long till ſhee come to it. And when ſhée commeth feede her, and reward her as pleaſantly as you can: But if ſhée come not, giue her nothing at all vntill ſhe be very ſharpe ſet. And this order muſt you kéepe with your Hawke ſeauen or eight dayes together.</p>
               <p>When you would lure her, giue her vnto ſome other man to holde, and call her with a lure well garniſhed with meat on both ſides, as you called her to your fiſt. After you haue vſed that manner of calling 6 dayes or thereabouts, cauſe her to bée held further from you, and caſt the lure about your head, and throwing it out vpon the ground a little from you; And if ſhée come to it roundly, then feede her &amp; rewarde her bountifully. And whiles your Hawke is vpon the lure, go about her fayre &amp; ſoftly, luring and crying, wo, ho, ho, as Falconers vſe. And when you haue thus done by the ſpace of certaine dayes, take your lure garniſhed as before ſayd, and euery day call her to you as farre as ſhée may well heare and perceyue you: and let her bée looſe from all her furniture, that is without eyther loynes or cryance: and if ſhée come ſo far off to you, then féed &amp; reward her wel, and ſtop her in her féeding oftentimes, for that will make her come the better: but take héede that you hurt her not in ſo doing. You ſhall alſo ſometimes call her on horſeback. And when you haue vſed her thus a month, or vntil ſhe come well and roundly, and that ſhée be familiar with the man without any ſtrangeneſſe or coyneſſe, then myy you ſtop the lure vpon her, and make her flée vpon you. But before you do ſo, it ſhall be méet to bath her, leaſt when ſhée is at libertye ſhe rangle to ſéeke water, and ſo you might léeſe your Hawke: &amp; euery ſeuen or eight dayes, your Hawke ſhould be ſet to the

water, for the nature of them ſo requireth. When you haue thus manned, reclaimed and lured your Falcon, go out with her into the fields, and wiſtle her off your fiſte, ſtanding ſtill to ſée what ſhe will, do &amp; whether ſhe will rake out or not. But if ſhée flee round vpon you, as a good Hawke ſhould flée, then let her flée a turne or two: which done, throw her out the lure and let her foot a hen or a pullet, and kill it and féede her well thereupon. Vnhoode her often as you beare her, and ceaſe ſo to doe vntill ſhée haue endewed and mewted ſufficiently.</p>
               <p>When your Falcon is thus made and manned, go abroad with her euery morning when the weather is fayre and calm, and chuſe a place for her to flee in, where there is ſome narrow brooke or plaſh of water. And when you caſt her off, goe into the wind ſo far that the fowle may not diſcrie you. And when ſhe is caſt off, and beginneth to recouer her gate, make you then towards the brooke where the fowle lie, alwayes wyſing &amp; making your hawke to leane in vpon you. And when you perceyue that ſhe is at a reaſonable pitch, then (her head being in) lay out the fowle and land it if you can, and if you cannot, take downe your hawke, and let her kill ſome train, as thus. Take with you a ducke, and ſlip one of her wing feathers, and hauing thruſt it through her nares, throw it out vnto your hawk, &amp; caſt it as hie as you can right vnderneath your hawke that ſhe may the better know your hand, and you. And reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that you neuer flee a young hawke without ſome quicke thing carried into the field with you, that if ſhee faile at firſt to kill the wild fowle, you may yet make her kill that traine which you bring with you. And this you ſhall do for a certaine time, vntill your hawke be wel entred and quarried, and that ſhe know a quarrior ſufficiently. Some other Falcons there be of a contrarie nature, which will require great skill to finde their properties. And the ſame being known, you may kéepe them high or poore, according to their conditions. So ſhall you doe more good with them, than if you haue no reſpect to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſity of their nature: for then you ſhould commit great er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and ſeldome make good hawkes. You may train hawkes
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:28166:70"/>
in this wiſe. Firſt you ſhall feede your Hawke well vpon a fowle of the ſame kind that you would traine her withall, or haue her flée to. And you ſhall do ſo vntill you haue acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted your Hawke with that kind of fowle, the which you may doe in this ſort. Take that fowle that you will make the traine of, and ſet it on foote with meat tyed vpon the backe of it, and goe ſo neare it, that the Hawke may ſée it: and when ſhée ſéeth it, let her ſeaze therevpon, and foote the fowle, and kill it. Or you may thus doe better: Take a Cryance and tye the fowle (which hath the meate tyed on her backe) by the beake, and cauſe one to ſtand cloſe which may hold the ſame Cryance. Then vnhood your Hawke, and ſtand a far off, and let him draw the fowle and ſtirre it with his Cryance, vntill your Hawke may ſée it ſtirre. And if ſhée foote it, then may you afterwards make her this other kind of traine. Take a quicke fowle which can flée, and when you haue halfe ſéeled it, and caſt it out, let your Hawke flée to it, and if ſhe kill it, reward and féede her vp well vpon it. (∵)</p>

               <p>IF you would know how to féede and man Sparowhawkes that be taken tender penned out of theyr eyrie, it is méet y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> you kéepe them in a freſh and ſwéet place, and giue them as much as they will eate of ſmall birdes, as Sparrowes, Mart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:28166:71"/>
and ſuch like. And alſo you may giue them other fleſh, but ſée that it be ſwéet, cleane, &amp; good, ſhred into ſmall pellets vpon a cleane trencher. When they begin to waxe fullſomed, giue them Sparowes, and other ſmall birds whole, that they may learne to plume, foote, and tyre: and ſet them a baſon of cleane water in a heape of ſand, that they may bath therein, &amp; proine and picke their feathers. They that be thus dealt withall doe not know how to prey, &amp; therefore you muſt enter the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bytrains in this maner. Take a yong chicken which is of color &amp; plume like a Feaſant or Partrich, &amp; caſt it out before your ſparhawk. But if ſhe flée not vnto it, nor do foot it, then ſtrip the skin vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the head of the chicken vntill it bléed, &amp; ſhe will lightly ſeaze it, thinking that it is fleſh to féed vpon. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> féed her vpon it well, and thus you ſhall vſe her vntill ſhe will ſeaze a chicken of her ſelfe. When ſhe will take a chicken of her ſelfe, goe into ſome fayre cloſe or meadow, where nothing may bee to interrupt you, and take a yong chicken, and throwe it vp vnto your hawke, vntill ſhe flée to it and foot it: then féed her vp there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vppon, and coye her as much as you can deuiſe: For <hi>Nyaſſe</hi> Sparowhawkes are much more daungerous and coy than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers be. When your Sparowhawke will foot a chicken well as before ſayd, then you may traine her thus. Cauſe ſome of your ſeruants or others to ſtand cloſe in ſome ditch or other priuy corner, with a liue chicken in his hand: and ſtand your ſelfe with your Sparowhawke vpon your fiſt a little diſtance from him: then cry and ſpeake as you would ſpeake, and cry to your ſpaniels when they range the field. And when you thinke that your ſparowhawk looketh that way as he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hath the train ſtandeth, let him caſt vp the chicken as high as he can, and let your Sparhawke flée thereat and ſeaze it. That done reward her, and féed her therevpon, making much of her, &amp; chéering her euermore among. Thus ſhall you do twice a day. When you haue thus trained her, mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t on your horſeback, &amp; giue her like trains in the field as before ſaid. Then ſet her ſharpe againſt an euening, and go out to ſéeke ſome game: &amp; if you find, ſéeke to make her one flight at aduantage, and let her flée but once, and
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:28166:72"/>
ſup her vp vpon the prey. Thus in foure or fiue dayes at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning I would haue you let her flée but one flight in a day, rewarding her well alwaies when ſhée killeth any thing, to the end ſhée may know her game the better, and take the greater delight therein, vntill ſhe be throughly nouſled. To kéepe your Sparrowhawke in good order, riſe early in the morning, and taking her vpon your fiſt, tap her on the trayne with your two forefingers, and ſtroke on her wings that ſhée may mantle and warble, and aduance her ſelfe bolt vpright, and delicately vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your fiſt. Sometimes alſo take off her hoode, and put it on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine faire and ſoftly, for rebuking her. When you haue kept her two howres vppon the fiſt, then ſet her in the Sunne to weather her halfe an howre: that being done, call her to your fiſt with meat, and whiſtle to heroften, and chirpe with your lippes, that ſhe may learne to know that voyce when you call her, &amp; when ſhe commeth reward her well. Thus you ſhould vſe her daily, vntill ſhe come well to the fiſt: reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bring alwaies that you deale with her as gently, and as amiably as you can deuiſe. When ſhe is well manned, and well comming, trie if ſhe couet not the water to bath her. And if ſhe do bath, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may you afterwards flée with her: But firſt, get on horſebacke, and call her from off the ground with a cryance, for feare leaſt ſhée ſhould thinke ſtrange to come to you on horſebacke: and if ſhée come well to you from the ground, being on horſebacke, then may you boldly flée with her. But remember alwaies to eſpie ſome flight with adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage at the firſt, for diſcouraging of your Hawke: For if ſhe be once well nouſled and entred, you may afterwards be the bolder how and when to flée with her.</p>

               <p>To feede with riuer fowle, and ſuch like, there are ſome of them good, and ſome bad, as I will briefly declare.</p>

               <p>The fleſh of a Ducke or of a Crane (as they report) is good and wholeſome.</p>
               <p>The fleſh of a Partrich is moſt excellent when a hawke is ſicke and diſeaſed.</p>
               <p>The fleſh of a wild Gooſe, or of a ſlecked Crow, is good: but you muſt giue your Hawke but litte thereof, and none at all of their blood, for it is ſalt, brakiſh, &amp; of an euill nouriſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</p>
               <p>The fleſh of theſe fleſh Crowes, and of the Wagtayles, (a Diſhwaſher as we tearme them, in Latine called <hi>Motacilla</hi>) &amp; the Cormorant, is of euill nouriſhment and digeſtion.</p>
               <p>The fleſh of a white Storke, and alſo of the blacke Storke, called (<hi>Saracireſia</hi>) is euill of nouriſhment, and hard to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewed, and ſtincking.</p>
               <p>The fleſh of the Bitter, and Sea Coote, is good and ſound, eſpecially when the Sea Coote doth feed and ſcoure her with ſand, it is good to enſeame and breath a Hawke: although na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally all water fowles are cold of complexion, moyſt, and hard of diſgeſtion.</p>
               <p>The flew of the white Heron, otherwiſe called the Shoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and of the blew and aſhe coloured Heron, is of good digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and nouriſheth well.</p>
               <p>The fleſh of Finches, hedge Sparowes, and ſuch like, are in maner all one: and you muſt beware that you giue not your hawke too much of them at once.</p>
               <p>The Cuckoes fleſh is indifferent good for a hawke.</p>

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:28166:74"/>
Falconers: but <hi>Ptholomeus</hi> King of Egypt doth alleadge the contrary, ſaying, that naturally all fowles which liue vppon fiſh, frogs, or ſnakes, and ſuch like venemous wormes, are euill of diſgeſtion, and that their blood bréedeth opilations and euill humors, although they ſéeme to delight hawkes to féed on them for their delicate ſwéetnes and taſte.</p>
               <p>The fleſh of the red Hearon is good: but you muſt giue but little of it.</p>
               <p>The fleſh of the Swan, and many other kinds of Water fowles, too long here to be rehearſed, are to bée vſed according to the time and circumſtances of occaſion.</p>
               <p>The fleſh of Sea-crowes, and Rauens, Cormorants, and ſuch like, are of a brakiſh bloud, and therefore you may now and then giue your hawke a gorge thereof: but you muſt not vſe it often.</p>
               <p>The fleſh of rauening birds, as Kites, Puttocks, Harpies, Eagles, Eyrons, and ſuch like, all theſe are very contrary to the nature of Falcons, and are ſtinking, of euill diſgeſtion, &amp; chollericke. Their bloud and braines are worſt of all, for they bréed perillous wormes.</p>
               <p>The fleſh of all birds which féed vppon ſéeds, as Feaſants, Partridge, Quailes, and ſuch like, are the beſt that can be, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially when a Falcon or any other hawke is ſicke.</p>
               <p>Doues fleſh is excellent, either when a Hawke is ſicke, or to mew withall: for it makes a hawke to mew well and quickly.</p>
               <p>Pullets fleſh, and Chickens fleſh, is good at all times, and alwaies in ſeaſon, as the fleſh of that faire fowle <hi>Bella Dounais.</hi>

the which hauing béene in the hands of ſuch as could not well ſkill of them, become coy and very vntowarde to bée hoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and will hardly be wonne to abide the Hoode by any meanes. In this caſe you muſt firſt ſéele your Hawke, and beeing ſéeled, you muſt fitte her with a large eaſie hoode: and hoode and vnhoode her often therewith, watching her a night or two, and handling her oftentimes about the head as before ſayde, vntill ſhée haue forgotten that fault. And when ſhée once doth leaue it, you may vnſeale her in an euening by can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle light, handling her ſtill ſoftly with your hand about the head, hooding and vnhooding her oftentimes, vntill ſhée will well abide the Hoode, and brooke to be handled. And here I thinke good to expreſſe mine opynion, that he which taketh in hand to be a Falconer, ought firſt to be very patient, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall to take ſingular delight in a Hawke, ſo that hée may ſéeme to be in loue (as it were naturally) with his Hawke, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen that a man would ſay, it were a thing bread ſo in the bone as it could neuer bee rooted out of the fleſh.

               <head>How to keepe a Hawke high fleeing.</head>
               <p>WHen a Hawke is well made to the riuer, you ſhould not flée with her aboue two flights in a morning, but féede her vp although ſhée kill not: but if ſhée be a ſtately high fléeing Hawke, you ſhould not in any wiſe flée her aboue one flight in a forenoone, for it will bring her downe, and make her fall off her ſtately pitch by often fléeing, and becomming gréedy and hote of the quarrey. When a good high fléeing Hawke béeing whiſtled, or caſt off the fiſte, doth gather vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to a great gate, you muſt haue regard to continue her therein, fléeing with her vpon broade waters and open Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, eſchewing little brookes, and gullets, and ſuch places as lie near vnder couert, where there be trées, ſhrubs, and buſhes in ſuch ſort that it will be very hard to land a fowle handſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from them, at leaſt not without helpe of dogges, and great clapping and a do. Yea ſometimes eke you muſt of force a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light from off your Horſe, all which things are able to marre a high fléeing hawke. Foraſmuch as crying, clapping of hands, noyſe, bawling of dogges, and alighting on foote, and furthermore when a Hawke cannot ſée the water vnder her, al theſe things doe teach her to forget her kindly fléeing, and to
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:28166:84"/>
play the Kite, houering and winding as the Kite doth in the ayre without any ſhew of ſtate: and in twice or thrice doing ſo, ſhée abateth her gate, and marreth her ſléeping. Therefore let the Falconer take good heede to that conſideration, and kéepe his hawke alwayes as high fléeing as he can, ſuffering her but ſeldome to kill, and not to ſtoope, beyond twice or thrice at the moſt, and euen when ſhée is at the higheſt, let him take her down with the lure: where when ſhée hath plumed and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the fowle a little, let him féed her vp, and by that means hée ſhall maintaine his Falcon high fléeing, and inward, and very fond of the lure. Here I will not deny but that if ſhée kill euery day, although ſhée ſtoope from a very high gate, yet if ſhée be not rebuked or hurt therewith, ſhe will doubtleſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come euery day higher fléeing than other, mary therewithall ſhée will ſo much forget the lure, as the more you ſhew it her, the more ſhe will bend from it, and flée out on head from her Kéeper: and oftentimes wil teach you hot poaſting iourneys. Wherefore aboue all thinges, the high fléeing hawke ſhould be made inwards, and (as we tearme it) fond of the lure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is no leſſe prayſe worthy in a high fléeing Falcon to make in, and turne head at the ſecond, or third toſſe of the lure, and when ſhée powreth downe like a ſtone vpon it, than if ſhe had killed: nay rather ſuch are more eſtéemed than the other. And ſo is the Falconer more prayſe worthy which doth winne his Hawke thereunto. For to come vnto the lure is a thing taught by art and induſtry, but to kill a fowle is the naturall property of a Hawke.</p>

               <head>To make a high fleeing hawke vpwards.</head>
               <p>IT hapneth oftentimes that a Hawke (although ſhee bée na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally high fléeing) will yet belong before ſhe be made vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, but will fiſh and play the ſlugge: for when ſhe ſhoulde get vp to couer the fowle, ſhee will ſtoope before the fowle bee put out, the which may procéede through two cauſes. Firſt, it may bee that ſhée is too ſharpe ſette, and the ſecond cauſe
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:28166:84"/>
may be that ſhee is flowen withall out of time, eyther too ſoone or too late. So that when you ſee a Falcon vſe thoſe euill tat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches without apparant cauſe, you ſhall do well to caſt her out a dead fowl or a dead pullet for a dead quarrey (as Falconers tearme it,) and to hoode her vp without any reward, to the end ſhe may take no encouragement to vſe thoſe vile trickes: for there is no greater ſpoyle to an high fléeing Hawke, than when ſhée killeth a fowle from a baſe and low pitch, and ſo much the greater is the loſſe of her, by how much the more ſhee doth vſe thoſe vile buzardly parts. Therefore by my beſt experience I prayſe that order, to throw her out a dead quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey and hood her vp: then afterwards within halfe an howre, call her to the lure and féede her, and doe this as often as ſhee vſeth to fiſh or to play the baſe flugge on that faſhion, and to find whether it procéed of beeing too ſharpe ſet, or of fléeing out of time, the Falconer ſhall doe well with all diligence to note the naturall diſpoſition of his Hawkes: as which will flée beeing hie and in good plight, and which beſt, when ſhe is kept low, which will flee beſt when ſhee is ſet moſt ſharpe and eager, and which contrary, and which in a meane be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene both, which earely at Sunne riſing, and which when the Sunne is two howres high or more, which ſooner, and which later in an euening. For the natures of Falcons are very diuers and ſondrie, in ſuch ſort as to flee with a hawke at her beſt howre and time, and to flee with her out of that time, is a thing which will ſhew as great difference, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween an excellent good Hawke, and a Kite. Therefore let the Falconer haue eſpeciall regard thereunto, ſetting his Hawkes to flee according to their natures and diſpoſitions, and keeping them alwayes in good order. And heere it is to be noted, that al hawkes, aſwell ſoarhawks, as mewed hawkes and haggartes, ſhould be fet out in the euening two or three houres, ſome more and ſome leſſe, hauing conuenient regard to their nature, as it is ſtronger or weaker: and in the morning alſo, accordingly as they caſt, hooding them firſt, &amp; then ſetting

               <head>To make a Falcon to the Hearon.</head>
               <p>NOw to teach you to make a flight at the hearon: although it be the moſt nobleſt and ſtately flight that is, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to behold, yet there is no ſuch art or induſtry therein as in the other flights. For the Hawke fléeth the Hearon: moued by nature, as againſt her proper foe: but to the riuer ſhée fléeth as taught by the induſtry &amp; diligence of the Falconer. Then muſt it néedes follow, that (ſuch Falconers as haue flowen at the riuer, when the end of the moneth of February, or the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of March is come, a time when Hearons beginne to make their paſſage) if you will make thoſe Falcons to that flight, you muſt ceaſe fléeing at the riuer with them any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: but you muſt pull them downe and make them light, the which you ſhall doe by féeding them with no wilde meats, but the hearts and fleſh of Lambs, Calues, and chickens, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of them to the lure with other make Falcons, that is to ſay a caſt at once, to the end they may accuſtome and acquaint themſelues one with another, and ſo may the better flée the Hearon by helping one another, and by ſuccouring each other. Herein you muſt take good héed ſo to acquaint them that they crabbe not together, for ſo would they doe when they come to the flight, whereby they might be in perill to bee ſpoyled or kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. When your Falcons be ſkowred and cleane, ſo as béeing ſharpe ſet, they may be called hungry hawkes, or (as Falco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners tearm them) eager hawkes, you muſt get a liue Hearon, vpon the vpper part of whoſe bill or truncke you muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey the ioynt of a réede or Cane, ſo as ſhee may not hurt the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:28166:85"/>
hawke therewith: that being done, tie the Hearon in a Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, then ſetting her vpon the ground, vnhood your hawke, to the end that when ſhe eſpieth the Hearon, ſhe may flée her: and if ſhe doe ſo, make in apace to ſuccour her, &amp; let her plume, &amp; take blood of it, allowing her the braines, the marrow of the bones, with the heart all together: (the Italians call it <hi>Soppa.</hi>) Hauing thus laid it vpon your Hawking gloue, giue it your Hawke: and afterwards rippe the breaſt of the Hearne, &amp; let your Hawke feed thereon vntill ſhe bée well gorged. This bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done, hoode her vp vpon the Hearon, ſuffering her plume thereon with all the fauour that may be: then take her vpon your fiſt, and let her tyre a little vpon the foote or pynion of the wing. But if a Falconer haue not ſtore of Hearons to traine withall (as often it hapneth, by mean the fowle is rare and daintie,) then may he doe thus: When he hath armed or caſed the Hearons tronke with a Cane or réed, as before ſaid, he may take a péece of a Calues ſkinne, or ſuch other like, as long as the necke of a Hearon, &amp; beginning at the head, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing to the ſhoulders &amp; body of the Hearon, let him ſew it in proportion &amp; ſhape of a ſheath, that it may arme the hearons necke &amp; head: &amp; afterwards with a penſill, pen, &amp; incke, or ſuch other deuice, let him paint it as like as he can to the necke and head of an hearon, with fethers &amp; euery thing to the purpoſe. Then let him ſet the counterfeit Hearon vpon the ground, as before ſaid: and when the Hawke doth flée it and foot it, he muſt haue a quicke yong Pigeon, the which he muſt hanſomly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey vnder the Hearons wing, and let the Hawke plume and féede thereon, reſeruing the hearon ſafe for an other time, and to make traine againe with it the next day. Then hauing thereupon rewarded your Hawke, and coyed her ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, you may goe the next day into a meadow, or other conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient place with your Falcon on your fiſt: and giuing the Hearon armed as before ſaid, to ſome other which may holde it vnder his arme a good way off from the Hawke, as halfe an Arrowe ſhoote or more: Then your Hawke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:28166:86"/>
vnhooded, giue ſigne vnto him to throw vp the hearon on hie, and if your hawke ſeaze it, reward and féede her with a pigeon as before ſaide, dealing familiarly with her, and the third day you may doe again in like manner, cauſing him that holdeth the traine to hide himſelfe as cloſe as he can, and to caſt out the Hearon as farre from him as he may. All theſe being done, and the Hawke hauing thus often taken her train to your liking, you may the fourth day in a fayre field, put out the Hearon without cryance, or arming her at all: and when ſhée is vp of a reaſonable height, you may caſt off your Hawke, who if ſhe bind with the Hearon and bring it down, then make in apace to reſcue her, thruſting the Hearons bill into the ground, breake his wings and legges that the hawk may the more eaſily foote and plume it. Then reward her as bountifully as you can with the braines, the marrow of the bones and the heart as is before declared (making her the Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian <hi>Soppa</hi>) many vſe to make a traine another way, which dooth not miſlike me, and that is this: they cauſe one to clime a trée with the Hearon, from thence he caſteth her out to the Hawke, and then they let their hawkes flée as before ſaid. But as touching theſe traines, it behoueth that the Falconer bée of good iudgement, as alſo in diuers other things. For euen as the Hawke doth flée them with better or worſe liſt and life, ſo behoueth if that the traines prouided be ſtronger or weaker accordingly. (∵)</p>

And in Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus they hawke with them to the Crane with the help of the peregrine Falcon in this order: When they haue found the Crane, the Falconer doth looſe his Hawkes hoode in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe, (I meane the peregrine Falcon) &amp; drawing as neare to the Crane as he can vnder the wind, when ſhée riſeth, hee quickly vnhoodeth his hawke, and lets her flée, and after her they caſt off a caſt or a leaſe of Sacres, which follow the pere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grin Falcon, that leadeth them as the more waighty and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Hawke: and becauſe the Crane ſtriueth not at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter in defence as the Hearon doth, but alwayes fleeth right forwards, therefore the peregrine Falcon doth ſeaze vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Crane, and buckling with her two or thrée boundes, the Sacres make in and beat her down to the ground vntill the Falconers come in to reſcue their hawkes, who ſpéedily thruſting the Cranes bill into the ground, doe eftſoone breake her wings and legs (as they do the Hearons,) becauſe they doe Hawkes moſt wrong with their legges and féet: which being done, they reward and féede all their Hawkes vpon the Crane, making them an Italian <hi>Soppa</hi> vpon their hawking gloue, of the braines, marrow, and the heart, but giuing the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:28166:88"/>
peregrine a greater reward than the Sacres, (yet with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion) they reward them altogether. Thoſe peregrine Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons which are good for the Crane, are much eſtéemed in <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus</hi> of great ſtates, and ſo much the more, by how much they are more rare and paſſing in perfection. But here amongſt vs this ſlight is not vſed, as well for that wée haue no ſuch or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ſtore of Cranes, as alſo becauſe our fields are not ſo playne, and frée without fewel, as theirs are in <hi>Cyprus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the order in <hi>Cyprus,</hi> but in <hi>France,</hi> the chiefe vſe of the Sacre, is to kill the Kite as I haue touched, and partly made you ſhew in the deſcription of the Sacre, in the former part of this Collection.

And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are hawkes (which maintaine long ſlightes,) they tyre a fowle in ſuch ſorte, that with dogges and hawking poles they kill many, and by that meanes they ſpoyle more with a Laner, than with a better hawke. Thus much I haue heard by credible reports. Theſe Laners are flowen withall at Partridge alſo &amp; Feazant, and ſome ſay that many of them proue very good therefore. But in Italie they vſe no ſuch flée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, pereduenture becauſe there is no great ſkill in it. If you would flée with a Laner, you muſt kéep her maruailous ſhort and ſharpe ſet.

Theſe hawkes (as far as I haue vnderſtood) do not flée the Riuer, but alwaies from the fiſt they flée the Hearons, Shouelers, and the Kite with the forked tayle, and at ſuch other flights. In going vp to their gate, they holde not that courſe or way which other Falcons doe. For they clime vp v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the traine when they finde any fowle, and as ſoone as they haue reached her, they plucke her down, if not at the firſt
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:28166:90"/>
yet at the ſecond or third encounter. They are fedee and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded as other Falcons are: they are very crafty of nature, and couet to kéepe their caſtings long through ſloth. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you ſhall not giue them caſting of Cotton, hut of Tow, Haſell, or hard things, as you ſhall do the Sacre and Laner. And you muſt kéepe them likewiſe very eager and ſharpe ſet. It is a Hawke that is flowen withall by great ſtates &amp; Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces moſt commonly.

                  <hi>I</hi> Like it well that men flée with a caſt of Merlines at once at the Larke or the Lenet. For ouer and beſides that they of themſelues loue company and to flée together, they doe alſo giue greater pleaſure or delight to the lookers on. For now
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:28166:91"/>
that one (at the ſtooping) ſtrikes the birde, and then that other at her downe come: and when that one climeth to the mown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie aboue the Larke, then that other lyeth low for her beſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage, which is moſt delectable to behold. Yea and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the poore birds become ſo fearefull, that they ſhrowde themſelues in the houſes and chambers of ſuch as dwell neare the fieldes.

And therfore it ſhall not be amiſſe to tye vnto their Ieſſes or Bewets ſome veruile bearing the armes of their owner &amp; maſter, (as if they were falcons) to the end they may be reſtored vnto them. But to returne to my purpoſe, I ſay that when the Merlynes are throughly manned, and made gentle, you may carry them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the field, where hauing found a Larke or a Lenet, (making looſe her hoode) you muſt goe as neare as you can into the wind to the bird.

But herewithall note that there is a kind of Larks, (called cutte Larkes) which doe not mount as the long ſpurd field Larke doeth, but flée foreheade before the Merlyn.

That being done, you may put them into the mewe. There
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:28166:91"/>
are two ſundry ſorts of mewing, that is to ſay, mewing looſe at large, or at the Stocke: and I will firſt ſpeake of this laſt kind of mewing.</p>

               <p>THe place wherein you ſhould mew a hawke at the ſtocke, ſhould be a low parler or chamber vpon the ground, farre from any noyſe or concourſe of people, and ſituate towards the North or Northeaſt. Place therein a table of a conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent length, for the number of your Falcons, and let it bée fiue or ſixe foot broad at the leaſt, with little thinne boardes or planckes all alongſt the ſides and ends, nayled on foure fingers high. And let this Table be ſet on treſtles of two foot high, or thrée foot high from the ground, and fill theſe Tables with great ſand, which hath prety little round péeble and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell ſtones in it: in the midſt whereof you may place ſome great frée ſtones a Cubite high, made like vnto a pillar, flat in the bottome, and playne &amp; ſmooth aboue, growing by péece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meale leſſe and leſſe vnto the toppe of them, Whereunto let your hawkes be tyed, eyther Falcon, Gerfalcon, Myllion, or Merlyne. Then take a ſmall cord of the bigneſſe of a bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring or little more, put it through a ring, and binde it about the ſtone in ſuch ſort that the ring or ſwyvle may goe rounde about the ſtone without any ſtoppe or let: And thereunto tye the leaſe of a Falcon, which may ſo ſtand vpon the ſaid ſtone being ſet in the ſand. But you muſt haue regard, that (if you mew moe Falcons than one at once in one roome) you ſet your ſtones one ſo farre from another, that when your hawkes bate, they may not reach one another for crabbing. The great ſtones are ſet, for that a Falcon féeling the freſhnes and coolenes of the ſtone, will delight to ſitte ſtill vppon it, &amp; the litle grauel ſtones are, becauſe a hawke will oftentimes ſwallow them to coole her within, and will kéepe them ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:28166:92"/>
two or thrée howres, or more within her. The ſand alſo is neceſſary, becauſe when they bate, they ſhal not marre their feathers, and alſo becauſe thereby their mewts are the eaſlier cleanſed, and to be remoued from them. The litle cord or bend with the ring on it, are tyed about the ſtone, becauſe the Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con bating this way and that way, ſhe ſhall neuer twind nor tangle, becauſe the ring followeth her ſtill. All day your Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons ſhould bée hooded vpon the ſtone, vnleſſe it be when they would féed, for then onely you muſt take them on the fiſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they haue ſed.

               <head>Of mewing at large.</head>
               <p>IF you mould mew your Falcon at liberty, and at large, then muſt you mew but one at once in one roome, and yet if the circuit of your mew be great and capable inough, there may two, thrée, or foure Falcons bee mewed therein well inough (with diuiſions.) The ſcope for one Falcon muſt bée 12. foote ſquare, &amp; as much in height, or therabout, with two windows a foot and a halfe broad, or two foot broad at the moſt. Wherof the one ſhould open towardes the North, whereby the mewe may alwayes receiue freſh cold ayre, and the other towardes the Eaſt, for the heat and comfort of the Sun. And each of theſe windowes ſhould haue his cloſe caſementes on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, to ſhut when you liſt, eyther one or both of them, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as occaſion ſerueth. If your hawke be a madbraine Kite, &amp; a great bater, then ſhould it be beſt that this mew or cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber were on the ground, which if it be ſo, you muſt couer the ground with groſſe ſand foure fingers thicke, and thereupon ſet a ſtone in ſuch ſort as before ſaid, becauſe Falcons do couet to ſtand vpon a ſtone. And therwithal you muſt make her two
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:28166:92"/>
handſome perches, neare to each window one, that ſitting on the one, ſhee may haue the comfort of the Sunne, and on the other, the freſh of the coole ayre, and euery wéeke, or at leaſt euery fortnight, you muſt ſet her a latten baſon, or a veſſell of ſtone or earth, and at euening fill it with water, that your hawke may to the water, if ſhee deſire it. And if ſhe doe hath therein, then take it away the night following, and haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that your baſon, panne, or ſuch other veſſell bee of ſuch bignes and depth, that a Hawke may therein commodiouſlie hath at eaſe. Your mew muſt alſo haue a Portall, wherein there may be a little hole below to conuey in the deuiſe wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their meat is ſerued, called amongſt the Falconers, the <hi>Hacke.</hi> And that muſt bée made on this faſhion. Take a péece of thicke boord, a foot and halfe long, and a foot broad, or ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, vnder the which faſten two little treſtles, thrée or foure fingers hie. Let them be faſt pinned or nayled to. Then with an awger or a pearcer, boare two holes on each ſide thereof, and through each of theſe put a ſhort corde of the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of a bow-ſtring, with the ends downward, through the holes, and knots faſt knit on them vnder the button of the boord, ſo ſtraight knit, that you cannot rayſe the cord aboue the boorde more than a fingers breadth, or there abouts. And when you would giue your Hawkes meat, take a little ſticke ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what longer than the Hacke, and as bigge as your finger, but let it be of ſtrong wood, as Crabtrée, Holly, or ſuch like. And vpon that ſticke binde your hawkes meat, and put the ends of the ſticke vnder the cords, vpon the Hacke, and ſo conuey it into the mew to your hawkes, becauſe the hawke ſhall not truſſe or dragge her meat away into the mew, but may féede there. And as ſoone as ſhee hath gorged her and fed, take it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way againe. And it is be vnderſtood, that if you mew more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one hawke ſingle, then you muſt haue for euery hawke her ſeuerall Hacke. And it ſhall be good to kéepe one ſet howre in féeding your hawke, for ſo ſhall they mew ſooner and better: and thus may you mew hawkes (looſe and at large.) But
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:28166:93"/>
vnleſſe it be a Falcon which is ſo hote and madbrayned, that you are forced to mew her ſo at large.</p>
               <p>In mine opinion it ſhall be better to mew at the Stocke or Stone, as before ſaid, or elſe to mew them at the grate, (as we call it.) For in that kind of mewing wee take our hawkes on the fiſte euery day, and ſo may ſee in what plight and ſtate they be. And if they be ſicke, or fallen into any infirmity, then may you giue them ſuch medicines as ſhall be declared in the next diuiſion, the which cannot bee done when you mew at large. And therefore I commend the mewing at the Grate, becauſe many times our happe is to haue Haggarts, or Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, or Lentiners, the which haue flowen eyther to the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, or preyed for themſelues. So that it ſhall bée néedefull to beare them often and euery morning in the coole ayre, vntill midde Iuly, or more, or leſſe, according as you ſhall ſee them ramage and coy, yea and to call them to the lure, and to ride abroad with them alſo ſometimes an howre or two, in the freſh ayre. And it ſhall be a thing moſt neceſſary for a haggart or a hawke that hath preyed for her ſelfe, eyther more or leſſe. This I haue obſerued in mine owne experience, &amp; me thinks it an aduertiſement worthy the noting vnto all Falconers. Sundry Gentlemen doe vſe to mew their hawkes on the pearch, which truely I can moſt commend, as well for that they are then aſſured to bée clean fedde, as alſo to be dayly peruſed for life, wormes, and other diſeaſes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to they are by nature ſubiect.

<pb n="182" facs="tcp:28166:96"/>
them to féed firſt a bit or two vpon your fiſt, with their hoods on, and afterwards aſmuch with their hoods off, caſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> down fayre and ſoftly to ſome pearch, and make them come from it to your fiſt, eyther much or little, with calling and chirping to them, ſaying: <hi>Towe, Towe,</hi> or <hi>Stowe, Stowe,</hi> as Falconers vſe, &amp; when they come féede them, crying &amp; calling ſtil to make them acquainted with your voyce, The next day you may call them with a Criance, ſetting them vpon a pearch vntill they come vnto you further off, feeding and rewarding them liberally to make them loue you. And when they come to the fiſt readily, &amp; without checking or ramageneſſe, then lay a little from you a dead pullet vpon the ground, the hawk ſitting vpon the pearch and calling and chirping to her, if ſhe come and ſeaze the pullet let her plume her, and féed a pit or two theron, walking about her vntill you may without danger or mouing of her, come neare and take her vpon your fiſt, and ſo féede her: That being done, let her tyre and plume. Here I muſt aduertiſe you that the wing of a pullet cold, is not good féeding for a Hawke: for it will make a Hawke ſicke: But the legs eyther hote or cold may be giuen. And likewiſe you ſhal mark that I would haue you caſt out a Pullet to a Goſhawke dead, and not aliue: for theſe kind of hawkes are much enclined of nature to play the Poulters. So that if you ſhould vſe to throw them out liue poultry, it might make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſomtimes when they flée, turn taile to the Partridge, and ſeaze the pullets or chickens which they ſhall ſée in huſbandmens yards and backſides when they flée. Or in like maner when they are ſet to bath at length of their loines, the which would not only marre them, and make them full of ill properties, but alſo might cauſe the ignorant people, (as women and boyes) to kill them in ſtead of a Puttocke. When you haue thus called your Goſhawke abroade two or thrée dayes, vntill ſhe be well cunning, you ſhall take her on your fiſt, and get vp on horſebacke with her, and ſo riding w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> her the ſpace of an houre or thereabouts, vnhood and hoode her ſometimes, and giue her a bitte or two of me at in the preſence and ſight of your Spaniels, becauſe ſhée ſhall not be afearde of

them. That being done, ſet her on a trée with a little ſhort Cryance tyed to her loines, and going ſeuen or eight yardes from her on horſebacke, call her to your fiſt with ſuch voyce and words as Falconers vſe: and if ſhe come, giue her two or thrée bits for reward, and caſt her vp againe to the trée, then throw out the dead pullet eight or ten yards from her.

               <head>To make a Goſhawke flee quickly.</head>
               <p>SOare Goſhawkes (eſpecially Niaſſes) are commonly very fond of the man, and therfore ſhould bée flowne with a little more ramage, and before they be throughly reclaymed, for elſe oftentimes within two or thrée ſtrokes with theyr wings, they will giue ouer the fowle that they flée, &amp; return ſtraight againe to their Kéeper. Therefore remember to flee with them as ſoone as you can, and that vntill they be perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nouſled and in blood. They muſt alſo be ſet in places where they ſée not many folke, for feare they become very fond of the man: But when they haue flowne, and haue killed twice or thrice, then ſet them where people and dogges frequent, the which ſhall bée neceſſary to preuent the inconueniences which might happen, when they are at marke neare to a houſe, or vpon a high way, if then they ſhould bée diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged with ſodaine ſight of any perſon that went by. And yet by this aduertiſement of fléeing quickly with a Soare Goſhawke or a Nyaſſe, I might make ſome Falconer learne a worſe miſchiefe, if by fléeing ouer-ſoone with his Hawke, hee ſhould pull her downe, or make her poore, the which would cauſe her to become fearefull and cowardly, and to giue ouer a Partridge, as I haue ſéene diuerſe, that although they were at the firſt very towarde Hawkes, yet after they haue béene once pulled downe, they haue loſt theyr courage and goodneſſe. And therefore by what meanes ſoeuer a Goſhawke or Tercell, ſhall become poore, it ſhall bée the Falconers parte firſt to ſette her vppe againe,

before he flée with her, vnleſſe it be ſome Goſhawke (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there are but few) which will not flée when ſhe is hie, &amp; in good plight. Then the Falconer may ſomewhat bate her fleſh and pinch her with ſcouring, waſht meat, and ſuch like deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: But let him alwayes rather kéep his Hawke in ſuch wiſe that ſhe may flée when ſhe is luſtie: &amp; therewithall let him ſet her abroad (when it is not ouer cold) betimes in the morning for one howre or twaine.

And the principal point of conſideration is, that you encourage any hawke well at the firſt.

killing of a Partridge or any other field flight: I will alſo declare how you may flée to the Riuer with a Goſhawke, and how you may kill great Fowles with her. A Goſhawke (but no Tercell) may flée to the riuer at Mallarde, Ducke, Gooſe, Hearon, and ſuch like, whether it be becauſe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not to the field, or for any other delight that ſhe or her kée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per hath to the Riuer. And you ſhal hold this order in making her, the which doubtles ſhall bring her to perfection: for Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawkes do more willingly flée ſuch flights than at any other. And yet is there great difference ſeene in the proofe of them: for ſome of them proue much hardier &amp; better than ſome other doe. Well, the Falconer ſhall firſt make his Goſhawke to the fiſt, in ſuch ſort as I haue preſcribed, when I taught to flée them vnto the field. Then muſt he carrie her into the field without bels, with a liue Ducke giuen vnto one of his companions. And the Falconer muſt haue with him a little drum or taberd faſtned to the pommel of his ſaddle, together with the ſinew of an oxe leg dried, which ſhal ſerue him to ſtrike vpon his drum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlet or taberd: and cauſing his companion to hide himſelfe in a ditch or pitte, with the Ducke tyed to a Cryance, his Hawke being vnhooded vpon his fiſt, he ſhall draw towards his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion which ſtandeth ſo hid in couert.<note place="margin">There hath beene vſed a kind of flight with a Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawk called the flight made to the becke, and it is like to this, but it is much ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> And when hée is neare him within two or three paces, or little more, hée ſhall ſtrike vppon his Tabarde twice or thrice: and his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion hearing him, ſhall throw out the Ducke aloft. And let the Falconer caſt off his Goſhawke to it, and if ſhe take it at the Sowrce, let him reward her and féede her with a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble gorge, making her all the cheare that may be: then let him take her vpon his fiſt and hoode her, ſuffering her to plume or to tyre vpon a wing or a leg of the Ducke. The next day hée ſhall not flée with her, as before I haue admoniſhed. But the third day he may go again in like maner with his companion, or elſe may ſeeke ſome water plaſh or pitte where Wilde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fowle lye, as Teales, or ſuch like. Prouided alwayes that he ſeeke the aduantage of his flight, where the Banckes bee
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:28166:101"/>

When they haue found them, both of them ſhall draw backe along by the banke, and the Hawke beeing vnhooded, they ſhall trotte both of them right vpon the fowle with their horſes. When they bee neare them, he which hath the Tabarde ſhall beate it, ſo that the Fowle may riſe, and then he may let flée his Hawke: and if ſhée take any of them at Sowrce, let him make in to her apace, and croſſe the Fowles winges, ſo that ſhée may foote it, and plume it at her pleaſure, rewarding her as before, &amp;c. And the better to encourage her, when he hath hooded her, let him ſet her vpon the Fowle, and let her plume it her fill, and after let him take her on his fiſt, and giue her a wing or a leg of the fowle to tyre on: And the next day let him not flee, &amp;c.

And hauing ſette her on the ground eight or tenne Paces from him, lette him vnhoode the Hawke, and twitch the Gooſe with the Cryance vntill hee make
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:28166:101"/>
it ſtirre and flicker with the winges. Then if his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawke bate at it, caſt her off, and runne in to ſuccour her, ſo that the Gooſe beate her not with her wings, for diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging her. And if he haue ſtore of traines, then he ſhall reward and féede her on the braines, heart, and thigh of that which hée trayned withall. But if hee haue no ſtore, then it ſhall bée néedefull to ſaue that for another traine. This done, let him cloſely conuey a pigeon vnder the wing of the traine, and reward his hawke therewith, as hath beene heretofore declared in the traines to the Hearon. And the next day let her not flée, but ſet her down, &amp;c. The third day he may giue her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother traine ſomewhat further off. And the third train hee ſhal giue it her on horſebacke, fiftie or threeſcore paces off at the leaſt, or ſo farre off as hee may come in to ſuccour his hawke in time. His hawke being thus trayned and entred hee may ride out with his hawke (without belles, becauſe the Géeſe ſhall not riſe before the Falconer haue brought his Hawke to the vantage) then with his Tabard to beate it vp, &amp; ſo foorth, whereof I haue told before. And hauing found any wilde géeſe, he ſhall ſhew them to his hawke, who being naturally mooued, will make from the fiſt to them, and will flee low by the ground, vntill ſhée come neare them. Then the Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coner ſhall ride after apace, and ſtrike vpon his Tabarde, vntill hée rayſe the wildgéeſe. And if his Hawke ſeaze any of them at Source, hée ſhall quickly ſuccour her, and reward her, &amp;c. But foraſmuch as wilde Géeſe will riſe as ſoone as they ſée any body. Therefore the Falconer muſt teach his Hawke to take the aduantage, which is thus done: As ſoone as hée hath found them a farre off, lette him alight from his horſe, and carry his Hawke vnhooded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind his horſe, ſtawking towardes them, vntill hée haue gotten reaſonably neare them, holding downe his hawke couerte vnder the horſe necke or body, in ſuch ſorte that ſhée may finde the Géeſe. Then the Falconer ſhall runne
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:28166:102"/>
in apace, and ſtrike vpon his Tabarde, to rayſe the Géeſe. And if ſhe kill any of them, rewarde her, &amp;c. Vſing his hawke in this order, ſhe may be made to kill two or thrée, or more, in a day. And in like manner may ſhee be made to the Crane: And in like ſort may hee creepe to flee at fowle which lye vpon pits or pondes.

But the Falconer muſt take héed, that as long as he may finde great flights, hée flée not at ſmaller fowle, to the end his Hawke way continue the more bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to flée great flights. For a man may ſoone make a Hawke a cowarde, and a ſlugge. Yet ſome there bée (but thoſe are very rare) which fleeing at all kindes of Fowles, become ſtill hardier and hardier, and better and better.

               <p>ABout the beginning of October, if you perceiue your Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhawke faire mewed, and hard penned, then giue her ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chickens, or Lambes hearts, and Calues hearts, by the ſpace of 20. dayes together, to ſkowre her, and to make her ſliſe out the ſlimy ſubſtance, and glytte out of her pannell, and to enſeame her (as Falconers tearme it.) That being done, one euening you may draw her out of the mew, and new furniſh her with Ieſſes, belles, &amp; Bewets, and of all other things that ſhall bée néedefull. And when you haue féeled her, keepe her ſo ſéeled two or thrée dayes, vntill ſhe will be gently hooded. And thereof a Falconer ought to haue a ſpeciall regard. For com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly all mewed hawkes are as coy to bée hooded, as when they were firſt taken. But when you haue won her to abide the hoode gently, then in an euening by candle light you may vnſéele her, and the next day you may goe about to ſhew her the fiſt and the gloue. And as I haue before aduiſed you to deale with Haggarts, or hawkes new taken from the Cage, you ſhall not forget to let her tyre and plume morning and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uening, giuing her ſomtimes in the morning, when her gorge is emptie, a little Sugar Candie, for that will helpe her mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailouſly to endew. Sometimes alſo when ſhée is emptie in gorge and panell, you ſhall giue her ſkowrings of <hi>Aloes Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catryne,</hi> Cloues and Staueſaker, wrapped in a little péece of cotton, or in towe, or linnen cloth. But hereof ſhall hée written more plainely in the treatiſe of medicines.</p>

               <p>SParowhawkes are to bee conſidered as all other kindes of hawkes are, according to their age and diſpoſition. Some of them are named Nyaſſes, ſome Braunchers, ſome Soare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawkes, and ſome mewed hawkes: Some alſo Haggarts,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:28166:104"/>
béeing mewed in the woode, they are called Nyaſſes, which are taken in the eyrée. Branchers are thoſe, that hauing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken the eyrée, are fodde by the old hawke vpon the boughes and branches neare about the eyrée, and thereupon they are called Branchers: afterwards they are called Soarehawks. They are called Soarehawkes, becauſe when they haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken the wood, and beginne to prey for themſelues, they flée vp aloft vpon pleaſure, which with vs Falconers is called ſoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. Mewed hawkes are all hawkes that haue once or more ſhifted their feather: and Haggarts are they which prey for themſelues, &amp; doe alſo mew themſelues eyther in the wood, or otherwiſe at large. To beginne with the Nyaſſe which is of greateſt difficulty to bring vnto any perfection, you muſt firſt féede her in ſome freſh coole Chamber or parler vpon the ground. And the ſame cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber ſhould haue two windows not very large, whereof that one ſhould open towards the North, and that other towards the Eaſt, to take the freſh coole ayre, or the comfort of the Sunne at her pleaſure. Theſe win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes muſt be open, barred ouerthwart with lathes, or thin bordes, ſo thicke that neyther your hawkes may gette out, nor your Catte may come in. And in this Chamber caſte and ſtrew Vine leaues, and other freſh leaues. For it refeſheth a hawke maruailouſly to reſt vpon them. And for the ſame conſideration it ſhall not be amiſſe to ſette two or thrée great frée ſtones in the chamber, whereuppon the Hawkes may ſitte coole and freſh. You muſt alſo haue two or thrée pearches lined or couered, one a little higher than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, ſo that the hawke as ſhe groweth huger and huger, may flée from one pearch to another, and neuer hurt her féete. And when ſhe is full ſommed, ſo as ſhe can flée, then wil it be méete and moſt neceſſarie to ſette ſome large baſon, or other veſſell full of Water, that ſhée may bath her at pleaſure therein. For that is not onely very wholeſome for her bodie, but alſo will make her put out her feathers the better, &amp; the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. And you ſhall doe well to ſhift her water euery three
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:28166:104"/>
dayes. You ſhall féed her with young Sparrowes, Marte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lettes, and young Pigeons, and ſometimes with ſhéepes hearts: and whiles ſhee is very young and little, you ſhould cutte her meate, and ſhredde it in ſmall pellets vppon a tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, or a cleane boorde for the purpoſe, ſetting it ſo neare her that ſhee may reach it with her beake, and feede. Thus you ſhall fade her twice, or more euery day, euen as you ſhall ſée her endew it, or (as Falconers ſay) put it ouer. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware that you giue her not gorge vpon gorge, for that will make her caſt her gorge. But when ſhee is full ſommed, and fléeth about, then you ſhall doe better to giue her whole birdes, and ſometimes to féede her vpon your fiſt, ſuffering her to kill and ſtraine the liue birdes in your hand: Yea and ſometimes to put quicke birdes into the chamber to her, that ſhée may learne to know them, to foote them, and to kill them, and let her féede vpon them her ſelfe in your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. For that ſhall bée very good as well to noule her, as alſo to make her leaue that vile condition which commonly all Nyaſſes haue, which is, to carry and hide their prey in ſome hedge or ditch, or ſecret place: and therein they will ſitte very cloſe for being heard, when they heare or perceiue their Kéeper to ſéeke them. Whereupon their Kéepers are oftentimes euill troubled and diſpleaſed. And alſo it ſhall not bée amiſſe, euery morning to goe into the ſaide Chamber, and to call them to the fiſt, whiſtling and chirping with your mouth, for by that means you ſhall both man them through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and alſo you ſhall gaine the time which you ſhould elſe ſpend afterwardes, in making them when they were ready to bée drawne out of the faid chamber.</p>

Then in an euening by light of a candle you ſhall vnſéele her, giuing her ſomewhat to tyre vpon, handling her, and ſtroking her feathers gently, ſometimes hooding and vnhooding her.

Then let her plume her, and foot her, and féed her thereupon with as much fauour as you may, and whiſtle to her, to make her know your whiſtle, vntill ſhée haue taken a reaſonable gorge.

As alſo vſing her to great chickins, ſhée will neuer couet to carry as ſhée would doe, if you trained her with ſmaller birds, which is a thing worthy the obſeruation, as you ſhall find by experience.</p>
               <p>And when you haue giuen her ſufficient traines of chicken and ſuch like, you ſhall one day ſet her ſharpe, then take a Quaile tied in a Criance, and in a plaine meadow: Firſt, ſhew her vnto your Sparowhawke, then throw it vp aloft, and caſt your hawk off handſomly after her, &amp; if ſhe take it, reward her with the brains, to nouſle and encourage her, but feed her with the leg of a chicken or pullet, and deale daintely with her.</p>
               <p>The next time you may traine her with a Quaile without a criance, the which hauing a legge broken, and two feathers pluckt out of each wing, giue it to another which may cloſelie throw it out to her, and féede her vppe thereupon with a good gorge. Being thus oftentimes trayned, you may ride out into the fields about nine of the clocke, where calling your Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowhawke to your fiſt, and giuing her a bitte or two of meat, go with your Spaniels to ſéeke ſome Beauie of yong quailes, aduancing your fiſt aloft, that your Hawk may ſée them whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſpring, and let her flée with aduantage at the firſt.

               <p>WHen your Sparowhawke is once made, you may go freely into the field: and if you find any young Quaile let her flee thereat with aſmuch aduantage as you can: and if ſhée take it, reward and féede her, &amp;c. Remember that at firſt entring of your Hawke you hold your fiſt aloft alwayes, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well becauſe your Hawke may ſee the game ſpring, as alſo that ſhée may learne to haue an eye to the Dogges, the which you ſhall alwayes cauſe to hunt on your right hand, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they raunge, but eſpecially when they queſt and call, to the end you may the better, and at more aduantage caſt off your hawk when you let her flée. And when your Sparowhawke doth know her game and how to flée, then may you flée more than one flight in a forenoone or an afternoone, ſo that alwayes you giue her ſom ſmal reward at euery flight that ſhée killeth. And becauſe it behooueth much alwayes to encourage your Hawke, and to kéepe her well nouzled, you ſhall doe well euer to carry a liue Quaile with you, that if you finde none, or flée and miſſe, you may therewith traine or ſerue your hawke ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly: and you may cauſe it ſo to be caſt out vnto her, that ſhée will thinke it is ſprung with the Spaniels. As alſo I would wiſh you euermore to kéepe aliue the ſecond Quaile that you ſhall take, and kéepe it in your hawking bagge, ſo as if néede be, it may ſerue you at night, or at any time to reward your Hawke with: for keeping your hawke in this order, ſhee can neuer lightly be diſcouraged. And when your Hawke is throughly entred, and perfectly well in fléeing, and well nouz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, then you ſhall hold your hand low, whereas before you held it aloft.

               <head>How to make a Sparowhawke, being eyther Soarehawke Ramage or Mewed Hawke.</head>
               <p>NOw I haue ſpoken at large of Nyaſſe Sparowhawkes, it were méet that I ſhould ſet downe ſome inſtructions alſo concerning Ramage Hawkes, and ſuch as are taken when they haue preyed for themſelues. And yet in effect the ſame precepts that ſerue for a Nyaſſe, will ſerue alſo for ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage Hawkes and mewed Hawkes. But yet they, (I meane ramage and mewed Hawkes) require not ſo much paine to make them know their game, nor to enter them, becauſe they haue béene practiſed in preying for themſelues, &amp; the Nyaſſes are altogether ignorant and ſimple: ſo that the Nyaſſes muſt be taught to know their game, in a manner, euen as they are taught by the bréeder in the wood, the which (as I haue heard old Falconers tell) when her yong Hawkes goe out of the neſt, and can hoppe or flecke from one bough to another, commeth in with ſome prey vnto them, and calling
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:28166:107"/>
them altogether, ſhe fleeth aloft, and lets the bird fall amongſt them, ſo that which ſoeuer of them catcheth it w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> her tallents, féedeth vppon it for that meale, and then returneth the olde Hawke for ſome prey, vntill ſhée haue fedde them all &amp; taught them to foote their prey. And therefore when a man hath them, Nyaſſe which neuer were taught ſo by the bréeder, hee muſt practiſe as neare as he can like the olde hawke, to teach them to foot, and to kil their prey, and to know it, the which you ſhal not be troubled with in a Soare, ramage, or mewed Hawke. For they which beare thoſe names, haue learnt to prey for themſelues: and moſt of all the mewed haggart Hawkes, for they are throughly nouſled and trayned therein, yea and moſt commonly they haue learnt ſuch conditions, that with all the paines wée can take, few of them can bee brought to any good perfection. But he which hath a Haggart Sparowhawk, muſt aboue all thinges take paines in weyning her from that vile fault of carrying, &amp; that ſhall he do by ſeruing her often with great pullets, and other great traines, the which ſhe cannot carry, and thereby ſhe will learne to abide vpon the quarrey. Alſo they which delight in Haggarts, muſt take great héede that they offend them not, but rather coy them aſmuch as they can with all deuiſes of fauour &amp; cheriſhing, for they will reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber fauor or iniurie much better than any other kind of hawk. And of the ſame condition are Lentiners for the moſt part, the which are called with vs March Hawkes or Lentiners, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus they are taken in Lent with lime or ſuch like means. And the Italians call them <hi>Marzarolli,</hi> becauſe they are taken in March or thereabouts: ſo that the Etymologie of the name procéedeth all vpon one cauſe, and they are called ſo whether they be Soar-hawkes or mewed hawkes. Neyther is there any great difference betweene them and Haggarts for euill conditions, but the Lentiners are more ſubiect to moiſt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, and eſpecially in the head, and therefore you muſt plie them with caſting and ſcowring, as ſhall be more at large de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in the Treatiſe of medicines.</p>

               <figure/>
               <p>MAny times it hapneth that a Goſhawke or a Tercell which was good in her Soarage, doth become nothing ſo toward or good when ſhe is mewed: and that procéedeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:28166:108"/>
in her ſoarage ſhée was not cheriſhed to make her take delight in her flight: for in a manner all the ſkill of a Falconer or Oſtreger conſiſteth in coying &amp; delicate vſage of his hawke and ſo cheriſhing her, that ſhée may take pride and pleaſure in her flight. Therefore I would not thinke it amiſſe if hée had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies at the firſt entring of his Goſhawke or Tercell, a train Partridge in his bagge, to ſerue her with, when néede doth require, and ſo he ſhall winne her loue. And therewithall let him marke theſe obſeruations, to keepe his hawke in good tune alwayes. Firſt, let him conſider that naturally all Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawkes are full of moiſt humors, and eſpecially in the head: &amp; therefore let him plie them with tiring and plumage, both morning and euening, for that will open them in the heade, and make them caſt water thereat. Let the Goſhawks tyring be the rump of a béefe, or the vppermoſt ioynt of a wing which we call the Pynion, or a chickens leg, giuen by the fire, or in the warme Sunne. This will not onely keepe your hawke o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in the head, but alſo kéepeth her in exerciſe, and vſe, and from ſlothfulnes, which might marre her, and vtterly ſpoyle her.</p>
               <p>It is good alſo to giue her euery night caſting eyther of feathers or of cotton, and then in the morning to marke whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be wrought round or not, whether it bée ſwéete or not, whether it be moiſt or drie, and of what colour the water is that droppes out of the caſting, for thereby hée ſhall iudge in what caſe his Hawke is. He ſhould alſo haue regarde to her mewtes, to ſée whether they be cleane or not, and therevpon he may giue medicines accordingly, as ſhalbe hereafter decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. For the infirmity of a Hawke being once knowne, it is the more eaſily cured. He hath alſo to conſider the ſeaſon: for in the winter and colde weather, he muſt ſet his hawk or Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell warme in ſome place where fire is made: he muſt rolle the pearch with cotton, or ſome ſuch like thing, &amp; the pearch muſt be ſet farre from the wall that his hawk hurt not her feathers when ſhée bateth: but if it be not colde, hee may ſet her euery
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:28166:108"/>
morning in ſome place where the Sunne hath power, for an howre or two.</p>
               <p>Remember that no hennes or pultrie come neare the place where your Hawke ſhall pearch, and eſpecially in Lent when Hens haue young chickens commonly following them.</p>
               <p>Remember alſo in the ſpring to offer your hawk to the water euery weeke, for elſe ſhée will ſoare away when ſhée fleeth, and make you ſéeke her.</p>
               <p>If your Hawke bath her at any time of her owne accorde after her flight, goe preſently to the next houſe with her, (if it bée in winter or cold weather) and weather her by a fire with her backe to the fire, and not her gorge, for that would make her ſicke. And likewiſe drie your Hawke if you haue carried her in the raine. Let a good Falconer or Oſtreger alwayes kéepe his hawke luſty and hie, and yet kéepe her in ſuch tune, that ſhée may flée beſt when ſhée is high: for doubtles the pluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king downe of a Hawk doth marre her and make her coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Aboue all things an Oſtreger muſt be patient and neuer chollericke.</p>
               <p>A good Oſtreger muſt alſo kéepe his hawke cleane, and her feathers whole, and if a feather bée broken or bruſed, hee muſt ympe it preſently, as ſhall be taught hereafter alſo in this booke, and therfore he muſt haue his ymping néedles, his Semond, and ſuch other things about him euermore in a readineſſe.

And your Sparowhawke being thus prouided of her mew, goe in to her in May in an euening by candlelight, and taking her ſoftly, giue her to thy companion to hold, vntill thou haue pulled out all her traine feathers, one after another, holding the princiyall feather with thy one hand (which Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coners doe call the couert feather) and plucking out the other feathers with that other hand, for ſo ſhalt thou doe her leaſt hurt: and this ſhall make her mew the faſter, if thou féed her with hoat meat and birds, and alwayes kéepe an houre cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to giue her her meat. Some will ſet water in the mewe by their Sparrowhawke continually, ſhifting and renuing the water euery ſecond or third day. Some ſet water before a Sparowhawke in the mew but once in a fortnight, and then
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:28166:110"/>
take it away againe within 24. howres after they haue ſet it there. Some will neuer ſet water before their Sparowhawks at all when they mewe them, ſaying that Sparewhawks are very hote, and pluck out their owne feathers for extream heat, and that therefore water is not to bee giuen or allowed them, becauſe it killeth and delayeth the heat in them, which ſhould further their mewing. I like that opinion: but for mine owne part and experience I would leaue the extremities and take the meane. And I would thinke it beſt to ſet water before a Sparowhawke in the mew, once in 14. dayes at the leaſt, or oftner, if the hawke ſéeme to haue néed, the which you ſhall ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily perceiue, if ſhe haue any feathers or downe that ſtand ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vp on her backe, and when ſhe ſitteth alwayes as though ſhe would rowze, or is twitching at her fethers with her beak, then ſet her water: but to ſet it by her continually, doth forſlow her mewing: and to kéepe it alwayes from her, doth make her that ſhe meweth not her feathers ſo cleane or ſo gallantly, as when ſhée may haue water once in a fortnight. As touching remedies for Hawkes that be ſlow of mewing, it ſhall be ſet downe in the Treatiſe of medicines in this booke alſo. (∵)</p>

               <p>BEfore I deale with diſeaſes of Hawkes, and cures due to the ſame, (which is the ſubiect of this third and later part of my collection of Falconrie) I hold it very neceſſary, and of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:28166:111"/>
aſwell to the attainment of the cauſe of each particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar diſeaſe, as alſo the deuiſe of remedy for each kind of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, to ſpeake ſomewhat of the complexions of Falcons, vnder whoſe name and nature (you know) in the beginning of this Booke of Falconrie, I haue compriſed all other hawkes, in regard that the Falcon is chiefe, and the Quéene of all other hawkes: nothing doubting at all, but that diuers wil muſe at the name and tearme of the complexion of a hawke, as though indéed there were no ſuch matter, led thereunto by their groſſe conceit and blinded imagination, for that they cannot in their opinions iudge ſo eaſily of the natures of Hawkes, as they can of the complexions of men, whoſe clearnes and thinnes of ſkin bewrayes their inclination and complexion, wheras hawkes are not in any condition ſo to bée deemed and iudged, by mean of their plumes: which indéede is farre otherwiſe, for, as in man the naturall complexion is truly diſcerned by the ſkinne, ſo is the naturall diſpoſition and conſtitution of a hawke by her cote and plume: which I aduenture not to report of my ſelfe, for that it ſtriueth too much with common ſenſe and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary capacity, but doe follow my Author, and thereupon am emboldened to auow it, not bluſhing to lay you down his ſpée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chches as touching this matter, though not in the French Phraſe, wherein he wrote it, but in the Engliſh ydiome, into which I haue tranſlated it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Artelowch</hi> mine Author, writing of the complexions of Falcons, in his treatiſe of Falconrie, medicines and cures, &amp; ſuch like matter, reporteth, and eke aduiſeth:</p>
               <p>That the blacke Falcons are melancholicke, and therefore ſhould of right be phiſicked with hot and moiſt medicines, by meane of their complexion, which is cold and drie, as with Aloes, pepper, Cocks fleſh, Pigeons, Sparowes, Gotes fleſh, and ſuch like.</p>
               <p>That the blancke Falcons are flegmaticke, and to be phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicked with hote and drie medicines, becauſe of their flegme, which is cold and moiſt, as with Cynamon, Cloues, Siler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, and Cardamomum, Gotes fleſh, Choghs, and ſuch like.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:28166:111"/>The ruſſet Falcons be of ſanguine &amp; chollerike complexion, mixt indifferently, and therfore to be phyſicked with cold me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, moderatly moiſt, and drie.</p>
               <p>As with Myrtels, Caſſia, Fiſtula, Tamarinds, Vinegar, Pullets, Lambs fleſh, and ſuch like.</p>
               <p>Hauing ſpoken thus much of the complexions of hawkes, a matter not long to be ſtood vpon, I will referre you ouer to the Italian Authors, as touching the diſeaſes &amp; cures, whoſe iudgements I doe very well allow, and in many points pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre beyond the French Falconers, for that they ſeeme to bée the more reaſonable men, and leſſe giuen to friuolous inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

               <p>IT doth belong to a good and ſkilfull Falconer, not alone to knowe all kindes of hawkes, and to haue the cunning how to reclaime, kéepe, fléepe, ympe, &amp; mewe the ſayd hawkes, with ſundry other like matters incident and appertayning to Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conrie: but it is very neceſſary and behoueful for him to haue knowledge and good experience in their diſeaſes and cures: for that they are birdes ſubiect to ſundrie maladies and acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentes, the cure of all which doth reſt in the carefull kéeper. Wherefore hauing (vnleſſe I flatter my ſelfe) in the former parts of this collection, performed my promiſe, made in the very entry and begining of this booke, as touching Hawks, and other matters belonging to the miſterie and ſkill of Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conrie: it is onely left now, and I reſt charged with their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes and cures, to dicipher vnto you the meane to know the maladies, as alſo a methode to recouer them: wherein if hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:28166:112"/>
any man deſire a more ample diſcourſe of the natures, &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall cauſes of thoſe diſeaſes, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> herein I ſhall bewray, let him know &amp; bethink himſelf, that I am neither profound Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher, nor learned Phiſition by profeſſion, but that in theſe I deale as a Falconer, manifeſting and making ſhew of cures proper &amp; peculiar to euery diſeaſe, wherw<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I could euer yet find a hawk charged, &amp; ſuch as may light vpon any kind of hawke, by miſfortune &amp; caſualty. And as touching remedies for their miſchiefs, I mean to ſpeak of very few which I haue not ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry times approued w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> very good ſucceſſe, wherfore I ſay, that hawkes may be diſeaſed and vnperfect, either in body or fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which I intend and mean, when they are vnable by any euil accident to perform their parts and duties in any conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as not to be able to flée, or ſtrain the prey w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their pounces, or any ſuch like action, which by natur they ought to perform.</p>
               <p>In body they are diſeaſed, eyther by ſome outward cauſe, as by a ſtripe or bruiſe: or els by ſome hidden and inward euill, as by corrupt &amp; contagious humors, procéeding either of too great heat &amp; moiſture of the head, or otherwiſe ouermuch drought &amp; ſiccity of the liuer &amp; inward parts, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which procéedeth many times the pantas &amp; ſhortnes of breath, &amp; other perilous euils, whereof I mean to write in their peculiar places hereafter.</p>
               <p>Again, hawkes are accuſtomed to be ill affected and diſeaſed (as I may tearm it) in their feathers, for that diuers times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found of body, &amp; in perfect ſtate of health, yet they cannot flée or ſtir their wings, by meane of ſome broken or ſliued fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, &amp; eſpecially the flags, long feathers, or ſacels, which ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry times are broken either in the quil, being bloody feathers, or neare the top or point of the feather: the remedy for which miſchief &amp; euil accident, I will reſerue to the laſt part of this treatiſe, as a matter méeteſt for that place. But becauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes and diſeaſes that grow within the bodies of the hawks may be beſt diſcerned and known by their excrement, &amp; by that which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth from them, as namely, by the caſting &amp; mu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <head>How to know the health and diſeaſe of a Hawke by her caſting.</head>
               <p>FAlconers do vſe to giue 2. ſorts of caſting to their hawkes, either plumage, or cotton: &amp; becaus moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly they giue the Falcon pellets of cotton for her caſting, I wil firſt ſpeake therof. You muſt make choyce of fine, ſoft, whit cotton, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of faſhion &amp; frame your caſting as big a great nut, &amp; at euening conuey it into her gorge, after you haue ſupt her: &amp; in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning betimes make diligent ſearch to finde it, to peruſe it in what maner the hawk hath rolled, &amp; caſt it, becauſe therby you ſhall perceiue her good or euil ſtate: for if ſhe caſt it, round, whit not lothſome in ſmel, &amp; not very moiſt or wateriſh, it is a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt token that ſhe is ſound. But otherwiſe, if ſhée rol not her caſting well, but caſt it long, not white, ſtinking, very moiſt, &amp; ſlimy, it doth argue, that ſhe is ful of diſeaſes, as I ſhall more ſpecially declare vnto you eftſoon. You muſt obſerue this, that theſe caſtings do import &amp; betoken the greater euill, by how much more they doe reſemble the muet of a hawk in color and ſmell. For by that they do make ſhew that your hawk doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> too much euil humor. Wherfore you muſt the more diligently mark it, &amp; wring it betwixt your fingers, to ſée how much, &amp; what kind of moiſture doth drop fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the caſting, &amp; w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al note the ſmel &amp; color therof. But now it is hie time to procéed to a more ſpeciall declaration of thoſe caſtings, that you may be perfect in each condition.</p>

               <head>Of naughty caſtings.</head>
               <p>IF your hawkes caſting be long, not wrought round,<note place="margin">Black ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting.</note> and bée full of water, how much more long and moiſt it is, ſo much more it betokeneth the hawke to be diſeaſed. And againe, if ſo it be blacke, &amp; ſtinking, ſo much the more the hawke is in euil caſe &amp; ſtate. All and euery of theſe ſignes do yéelde a ſhew and proofe, that the hawk hath béen foule fod, &amp; with corrupt fleſh. Wherefore to remedy this miſchiefe, you muſt féede her with hote Birdes, as Swallowes, Sparrowes, young
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:28166:113"/>
Doues and ſuch like, giuing them aliue, or as ſoone as they are killed.</p>
               <p>But if it ſo happen, for all this care and good intendaunce, that the caſting continue at one ſelfe ſtay, and be like euill in ſhew, then muſt you néedes giue your Hawke aſkowring, according to art, ſuch as I will teach you to make hereafter.</p>
               <p>If your Hawkes caſting be gréene, it is a ſigne that ſhe is ill affected and diſeaſed in the Liuer,<note place="margin">Greene ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting.</note> the cure whereof I will referre to a peculiar chapter for the ſame euil. But know ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe, that hawkes when they are ramage, diuers times doe caſt ſuch like gréene caſtinges as I ſpeake of, and make ſuch muets, by reaſon of ſome wilde fowle, that they haue kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and preyed vpon at their owne pleaſure, or otherwiſe haue had the ſame giuen them by Falconers. And a man néede not greatly force thereof, for that with good féeding, they will lightly be recouered, and ridde of this diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Yellowiſh black ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting.</note>When the caſting hapneth to bée yellowiſh blacke, and very moiſt and ſlimy, it argueth your Hawke to bee ſtuft with euill humors, procéeding of too great heat, or of immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate and ouer great flights, or too much bating. For recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of which euill, you muſt as ſpéedily as you may, beſtow good féeding vpon your hawke, and coole her, by waſhing her meat in good freſh water, as endiue water, or ſuch like, as ſhall beſt pleaſe the fancy of the Falconer, allowing her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides one or two, or moe caſtings of cotton: into which you muſt conuey very excellent good mummy beaten into pouder, and otherwiſe among incenſe, vſed in like manner. But if it ſo fall out that your hawke continue her ill caſting, for all this remedy it ſhall not be amiſſe, fortwice or thrice to giue her this kind of caſting, or vpward ſcowring euery other day.</p>
               <p>Take Aloes waſht and beaten to powder, one ſcruple, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Cloue foure graines, of Cubebes beaten to powder thrée graines: all which béeing well confected, and made in mixture, enwrappe in a péece of cotton and giue your hawke being emptie, and hauing no meate aboue, or in her pannell.
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:28166:113"/>
And I nothing doubt, but vſing this order which I preſcribe you, your hawke ſhall recouer in ſhort ſpace. In any caſe you muſt be circumſpect and héedefuil, hauing a hawke thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed, to marke diligentlie whether the doe mend or payre, whether ſhe waxe high, or abate her fleſh. For that according as ſhe ſhall doe any of theſe, it ſhall be neceſſary for you ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to augment or decreaſe your ſcowring, and her féeding. And beléeue me, I know this by experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that ſondry hawks doe periſh more by béeing ouer poor and low brought, through negligence of ill kéepers that make ſlender regard of them, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the extremity of the diſeaſe. This ſhall be ſufficient as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching caſtings of cotton, which (as I ſaid before) were peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar to Falcons.</p>
               <p>Falconers are accuſtomed to giue their hawkes caſting of plumage, ſometimes being empty aboue,<note place="margin">Caſting of plumage.</note> and eake in feeding to ſuffer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to take feathers, but ſpecially to Sparowhawks. They giue them ioukes of wings of ſmall birds, &amp; Quailes, when they haue fedde them, tearing them out with their téeth, and plucking away the longeſt feathers, and ſo giue it.</p>
               <p>Theſe caſtings ln the morning being wrought round, and caſt without any ill ſauour or ſtinke, doe make euident ſhewe that the hawke is ſound: and how much more round &amp; ſwéete they are, the better token of the hawkes géed ſtate. But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe, if the caſting bée long, ſlimy, and rammiſh in ſmel, with ſome ſmall parts of the fleſh vndiſgeſted, cleaning to the ſame, and withall frothie, hauing a kind of foame ſticking on it, all theſe things together, and euery one ſpeciall by it ſelfe, doe import the diſeaſe of the hawke, and make full ſhew of her ill ſtate. And therefore that ſhée ſtandeth néedfull of a good ſcowring, and good intendance, as I ſaid before.</p>

               <head>The way to know in what tune hawks are by their mewting.</head>

For if the mewte be white, and not ouer thicke, nor ouercleare, and beſides not hauing any blacke ſpotte in it, or at the leaſt but little, it is an euident proofe that the hawke is excellently in tune, and not diſeaſed. But if it be white, and very thicke in the middeſt, well it may importhealth, but it argueth the hawke to bee ouer groſſe, and too full of greaſe. And therefore it ſhall bee needfull to cure that miſchiefe, by giuing her liquide and moiſt meat, as the heart of a Calfe, Lambe, or ſuch like. And for one or two mornings, to allow her (being empty and hauing nothing aboue to put ouer) a quantity of Sugar Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy which will ſcowre her, and make her ſliſe, or elſe a gut of a chicken well waſht, of a conuenient length and ſize, ful of good oyle oliue, well clarified in water, in ſuch ſort as hereafter I ſhall inſtruct you.</p>
               <p>It is eaſily ſound, when a hawke is euer greaſie, and not enſeamed, by her mewte, when it is white with ſome blacke in it, which euil is eaſily remoued by giuing her hot Sparows, and young Pygeons.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The euil mewte.</note>But if her mewte be white, entermedled with red, yellow, grey, or ſuch like colour, it is a ſigne that the hawke is very ill and diſeaſed, &amp; moreouer that ſhe ſtandeth néedfull of a ſcow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, as of mummy purified &amp; beaten to pouder, wrapping it in cotton, or ſome ſuch like matter, to ſet the gorge &amp; ſtomacke of your hawke in tune againe, and other inward partes, as hereafter I ſhall make further ſhew of in a place méet for that ſpéech and diſcourſe.

               <p>The white mewt, hauing a greater part of yellow in it, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of any other colour, doth euidently make ſhew, that the

hawke is ſurcharged with chollericke humours, cauſed and engendred by ouer-great flightes, when you flee with your hawke in the heate of the day, as alſo of ouermuch bating. Which euill you may prouide for and eſchue, by giuing your hawkesmeat waſht in cold waters, as Bugloſſe, Endiue, Borrage, and ſuch like holeſome cold waters, very medicina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for that miſchief, alwayes remembring to ſtrain the hawks meat, and wring it in a linnen cloth, after you haue waſht it in the waters aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>And if this fall not out in proofe to your contentment, then if you can giue your hawke a quantity of Agaricke in a ſcow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, for the ſpace of one morning or two, not ſuffering her to flee, or doe any thing, but doe ſet her downe. There is no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, but by the care and diligence of ſuch a kéeper, your hawk ſhall quickly recouer.</p>
               <p>The mewt of a hawke which is very blacke, declareth her liuer to bée infected, and is the moſt deadly ſigne of all others.<note place="margin">The blacke mewte.</note> For if it continue thrée or foure dayes, moſt aſſuredly the hawke will pecke ouer the pearch and die. But if it bee ſo but once, and no more, it greatly ſkils not. For then may it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céede of one of theſe two cauſes: eyther for that the hawke in pluming and tyring on the fowle, hath taken of the blood or guts of the prey, which is a matter of nothing: or elſe becaus ſhée hath beene gored with filthy meate.

               <p>And yet for all this, it may be, that a hawke doth make the

               <p>By this which I haue ſpoken, as touching the mewtes of Hawkes, it may be gathered how greatly it doth import, and how behoouefull it is for a Falconer, or Oſtreger, for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cure of his hawkes, to peruſe euery morning with greate care the mewte of his hawkes.

               <head>Or the Fever or Ague wherewith Hawkes are wont to bee moleſted and troubled.</head>
               <p>I Haue noted and obſerued, that the Feuer happeneth vnto Hawkes, by reaſon of ſome ſmall colde, and heat enſuing the ſame. And verely in myne opinion, it doth much reſemble the Tertian, wherewith we our ſelues are dayly vexed. You may eaſily geſſe this griefe, when you ſée your hawke ſhake &amp; tremble, and preſently after hold hir wings cloſe vnder hir train, ſtouping down with hir head to the ground-warde. And beſides all theſe tokens, you haue one more, which is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> your hawke will haue hir barbe feathers vnder hir beake ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and out of order, and ſomtimes eake ſhe will refuſe hir meate. And if happely you touche hir with youre hande, you ſhall féele ſenſible the extremytie of heate that doth ſurcharge hir. All, or the moſte part of theſe ſignes, do euidently argue your hawke to bée troubled with a Feuer, a very daungerous griefe, but not altogether deadly, for that I haue ſéene many hawkes recured of this diſeaſe. Wherefore all your care muſt bée, to coole and refreſhe hir, becauſe in déede the Feuer is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but aninordinate heate. In this caſe, hir féeding muſt be eyther the leg of a chicken or a young pigeon, or ſome other ſmall fowle, but Sparowes laſt of all, for they are not to be allowed in the beginning of the diſeaſe, for their great heate. And you muſt remember to waſh her me<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Bugloſſe, or Endiue, or in a mucillage of <hi>Pſillium,</hi> in the iuyce of Cowcombers or Mellons, and afterwards drie it in a cloth, &amp; ſo giue it her to féedeon. Moreouer you muſt (if you do well) bath the perch, and alſo her legs in the Sommer with Plantaine water (or for want of the water, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the very iuyce of it) w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Lettice water, or Nightſhade water, and ſometimes among with the iuyce of Henbane, Lettice water, Nenuphar, Howſléeke, and ſuch other cooling deuiſes, to delay her inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate heat &amp; inflammation, ſetting her in ſome out place where the ayr is freſh, but not where ſhe may take the ayr too much,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:28166:116"/>
for that may breed a further inconuenience. If your ſick hawk be very low brought in ſtate, you muſt allow her a gorge twice a day, but with diſcretion and iudgement, not giuing her ouermuch at one time. And if ſo the Feuer ceaſe not by theſe practiſes aforeſaid, it ſhall be well done to giue your Falcon of excellent good Rubarbe, finely beaten to pouder, two ſcrou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, in a Cotton caſting, to purge &amp; ſcower her choler, which is the very originall ground of her Feuer. There are ſome that do wil &amp; preſcribe, that you muſt let your Falcon blood in the thigh, which albert I haue not experimented, yet doth it ſtand with reaſon, that it may doe good, if you can finely doe it: but it were much better in mine opinion, to open the vaine vnder her right wing, becauſe that would chiefely refrigerate, &amp; coole the lyuer out of hand, &amp; ſo by a conſequent, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole body through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. This order aforeſaid is to be vſed, if the feuer be a hoate feauer wherewith your hawke is moleſted. But if it happen to bée a colde feauer which you ſhall perceiue, by that your hawk will be extreame cold, if you touch her. Her eyes looke not of their wonted hew, and beſides all this, ſhée ſeldome mewteth and that with great paine.</p>
               <p>Then you muſt ſet her in ſome warme place, &amp; after her fitte of cold is paſt, ſhée muſt be gently borne on the fiſt. Beſides when the feauer hath left her, for that time you ſhould let her flée a little, it will doe her great good. Looke that her meat wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with you fée<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Beſides, you may giue your hawke the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid fleſh if it pleaſe you, with hony, and a little powder of Oil, Fenell, &amp; Commin medled together. But ſpetially you muſt obſerue this rule, and remember it wel, not to giue your hawk gorge vpon gorge: and again, if your hawke bee high in fleſh when this diſeaſe taketh her, ſhée muſt bée fed with little and
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:28166:117"/>
ſeldome, although in déede it be very good at all times, howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer ſhée bée affected, to keepe a reaſonable hand vpon her, as touching her dyet, whether thée bee diſeaſed or in perfect ſtate. For of ouer great gorges, and too full and liberall a hand, doe procéed a thouſand miſchiefes and diſeaſes to a Hawke, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience doth dayly inſtruct vs, both to the great paines of thoſe ſilly birdes, and the great griefe and coſt of the vnſkilful Kéeper, whoſe purpoſe and meaning perhaps, is by giuing his hawke liberally, to haue her flée luſtily, and to continue in perfect health and ſtate, whereas in troth nothing doth ſo much offend a hawke, as too great a gorge. As in all other things, ſo in this likewiſe, <hi>The meane is beſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some Falconers do preſcribe this methode for cure of the feuerin a hawke, which I doe not greatly commend or allow. They will you to take Reubarbe, Muſke, Sugar Candie, &amp; the iuyce of Motherwoort, and making a pill of thoſe thinges aforeſaid, to giue it your Hawke, feeding her afterwardes with Sparrowes, or young Rattes, which are very hotte meate.</p>
               <p>Otherſome appoint a paſte or mixture to be made, as bigge as a nut, of theſe things following, which being ſtéeped a ſpace in Vineger, muſt be giuen her, not dealing with her in ſixe howres after, at the leaſt. They take to the compoſition of this paſte, Aloes, Muſke, and the ſat of a hen, equall portions, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing it the hawke in manner aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>The Signes that they giue to know the feuer, are the wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the hawkes traine, the coldnes of her foot, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the caſting of her gorge. But the firſt rules and reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies do ſatiſfie me ſufficientlie, without theſe, becauſe I find in them ſome more reaſon: yet doe not thinke it amiſſe, to ſet downe diuers mens opinions, becauſe euery man may make his choice: for what likethone, perhappes contents not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

               <head>Of diſeaſes of the head, and firſt of the Apoplexie or falling evill.</head>
               <p>HAuing in purpoſe to treate of the diſeaſes wherewith hawkes thoſe ſilly birdes are vexed in their heades, I muſt do you to know, that vnder the name and tearme of the head, I doe not onely compriſe that part that containeth the braine, but alſo the eares, eyes, beake, or chap, nares, &amp; mouth of the hawke: al which parts are ſubiect to ſundry diſeaſes and euils. But firſt of all, I meane to ſpeake of the chiefeſt, and moſt principall part of all the reſt, &amp; of ſuch maladies as light vpon the braine, and after that, of ſuch as happen to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall and outward parts of the hawkes head. Among all which infirmities and griefs, I account the Apoplexie (whom the Italians call <hi>Gozza</hi>) the greateſt and moſt perillous, as the which doth ordinarily cauſe and bring ſodaine death.</p>
               <p>This miſchiefe doth commonly befall hawkes, by meane of too much greaſe, and ſtore of blood, for that at that time ther doth happily breake ſome one vaine or other in the braine, which doth fill ſome concauity or hollow cell of the braine w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> blood, in which Cels, (as the learned do imagine and affirme) the animal ſpirites are engendered, and haue their beginning. Without which animall ſpirits, no liuing creature can eyther haue ſenſe or mouing. Whereupon it doth follow of very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, and by a méere conſequent, that the paſſage of thoſe ſpirites being ſhut vp, and intercluded, the creature whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it be, muſt die.</p>
               <p>Againe, it may happen, for that the Hawke hath béene ſette too long in the heat of the Sunne, for by that occaſion there may bee ſo much humidity and moiſt humor drawne vp into the braine, as may engender this euill, and procure this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe in the hawke.</p>
               <p>Moreouer it may chance by making a long flight at a Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant or Partridge, in the heat of the day, by meane of which the hawke hath ſurcharged her ſelfe with ouermuch trauaile.
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:28166:118"/>
Wherefore it ſhall bee behouefull and neceſſary ſo to vſe the matter with care and diligence, as it may be foreſéene, that hawkes incurre not this aduenture and euill. Whereuppon for that hawkes in the mew, are accuſtomed to gather much greaſe, it ſhall bée good for the ſpace of fifteene or twenty daies before the drawing of them out of the mew, to feed them with lyquide and ſlipper fleſh, ſuch as may lightly bee put ouer, and paſſe through them. As namely, with the hearts of Calues, Lambes, or Goates, waſhed in luke warme water, and afterwards dried in a linnen cloth, before you giue it your Hawke.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe may you boldly féede your hawkes before they are drawne out of the mewe with ſmall Pullets, and young Sparowes. When you haue thus done, and obſerued this order of féeding them, when the time is come to drawe them out of the mewe, you muſt remember to draw them verie orderly, and after that, to continue the ſame kind of féeding, and to kéepe the ſame hand vpon them for other twenty daies ſpace at the leaſt, to ſcowre and diſburden your Hawkes of that ſlime and glitte, which doth ſurcharge them, hauing them alwayes for the moſt part on the fiſt, and eſpecially at night. Neyther ſhall it bée euill to ſcowre them, (or as our Oſtregers and Falconers do terme it) to enſeame them, by giuing them a quantity of waſht Aloes, allowing a Falcon as much as the biggeneſſe of a Beane beaten in the powder, wrapped in Cotton, &amp; ſo to make her a ſcowring thereof, and beſides to giue her Sugar Candie two or thrée mornings. But in any condition you muſt beware not to vſe Aloes vnwaſht, becauſe thereof are bred ſundry ill accidents in hawkes. And for that occaſion is it preſcribed you to vſe Aloes waſht, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide that vndoubted euill which would otherwiſe happen.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, I haue happily, and with good ſucceſſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued this remedy. I haue giuen ſo much larde, or but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as I could well conuey into my hawkes throat, when ſhée hath béene emptie aboue, hauing firſt prepared the lard,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:28166:118"/>
or butter, by waſhing it ſeuen, eight, or more times in clear water, and afterwardes letting it ſoake in Roſe-water a ſpace, and laſtly, by putting vnto it of the beſt Sugar that I could get, or Sugar Candie beaten to powder. And my order was, euer to giue this ſcowring euery ſeuenth or eight day. And this is not alone to bee vſed to hawkes in the mew, but alſo to ſuch as are kept on the pearch and ſtocke. But if it ſo fall out, that by theſe deuiſes and ſcowrings you cannot make your Hawke haue a ſtomacke, and gréedy appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite to féed, it ſhall not bée euill to piſſe vpon her meat, and hauing dried it in part againe, to giue her a gorge ſufficient, ſo much as may ſerue her, and as ſhée will take. For the more liquide and ſlipper fleſh you giue her, the ſooner will ſhée bée en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeamed. And by this meanes doe Falconers preſerue their hawkes from the falling euill, and ſodaine miſchiefe,<note place="margin">Adition.</note> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that from ſundry other perillous accidents, that doe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thoſe ſilly birds. [But if you take fine larde and beat it with Rue and Hyſope till it be all one body, and then make a round pyll and giue it to the Hawke, it will helpe all diſeaſes of the head.]</p>

               <head>Of the Apoſtumes of the head.</head>
               <p>FAlcons, Goſhawkes, and other birds of prey, are wont to be much cumbred and moleſted with the ſwelling of the head, and the Apoſtume thereof, a very grieuous euill, occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by aboundance of euill humors, &amp; the heat of the head. It is diſcerned by the ſwelling of the hawks eyes, by the moiſtur which ſundry times iſſueth and diſtilleth from the eares, and often eake by euill Sauour, and ſmell of the Apoſtume. Alſo it may be perceyued by the ſmall deſire the hawke hath to mooue or aduance her ſelfe by the wreſting of her heade, and the little regarde ſhée hath to tyre and pull the fleſh that ſhée feedeth on, as though indéede tyring were verie painefull to her, and by that ſhée is ſcarce able
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:28166:119"/>
to open her clappe, and beake, after her accuſtomed manner.</p>
               <p>Againſt this moſt perillous euill, it ſhall be very neceſſary firſt of all to ſkowre your Hawke throughly, and after that the head in chiefe.</p>
               <p>As touching the generall ſkowring. I can commend and allow you to giue her thrée or foure morninges, when ſhée hath no meate to put ouer, a pyll as bygge as a nutte of but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter waſht ſeuen or eight times in freſh water, and ſtéeped well in Roſe water, mingling it afterward with Honie of Roſes, &amp; very good ſugar, holding your Hawke on the fiſt, till ſhée make one or two mewtes. Which being done, to diſburde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and ſkowre the head, it ſhall be excellent well done to take of Rewe ſéede foure drammes, Aloes Epatick twoo drammes, Saffron one ſcruple, reducing and forcing all theſe to fine powder, and with a quantitie conuenient of honie of Roſes to make a pyll of that bigneſſe and ſyze, as may well be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ueyed into the hawks beake, by which her brayne may bée purged and ſkowred, thruſting the pyll ſo déepe into her throte, as you may well ſée, holding her a ſpace after it vppon the fiſt. And that doone, ſetting her downe on the pearch, in a conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient place, fit for the time, and two hours after, to féede her at her accuſtomed time with good hotte meate.</p>
               <p>But if happily there bee any of the corruption and filth in the Hawkes eare, it ſhall be very neceſſary, carefully with an inſtrument of ſiluer, or other good mettall for the nones, that the one ende bée ſharpe poynted and edged, of purpoſe to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply lynt, and on the other ende hollow, and faſhioned like vnto the eare of a Hawke, to clenſe and remoue the filth that furreth the hawkes eare. And with that ende, whereon the lynte or bumbaſt is, to ſkowre it very daintily, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently vppon the ſame, to infuſe and droppe in a quantity of Oyle of ſwéete Almondes, freſh and luke warme, and after the ſame to conuey into the eare a little lynt or bombaſt, to kéepe in the Oyle, till ſuch time ſhe bée dreſſed againe, to the ende the Oyle, may ſupplie and mollifie the filth, ſo as
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:28166:119"/>
it may eaſily bée remoued and clenſed. And this order muſt you obſerue and continue, vntill the Apoſtume be reſolued &amp; throughly ripe. But if it ſo fall out, that the Apoſthume wil not come to maturation, or ripe, in ſorte as it may growe to ſuppuration, and be mundified in manner aforeſaid, but wil reſt at one ſtay in the head of the hawke: then muſt you bée fayne to come to cauterize the head aloft, and beſtow a but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton there, to cauſe the humor to breath, and to bring the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt matter thither, remembring after this fire and cauterie to remoue the eſcarre, by beſtowing on it for the ſpace of eight or nine dayes, butter, by which you ſhall eaſily remoue the cruſt or eſcarre, which is made by the fire.</p>
               <p>You muſt not forget, if it be ſo, as your hawke bée ſo weake as ſhée is vnable, or ſo froward as ſhée will not féede and tyre vpon her meate which you giue her, then to cut it in ſmal pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, and ſo giue it her, eyther by fayre meanes or fowle, not leauing to vſe it ſo, if it be poſſible, as ſhée may receyue it willingly, and féede her ſelfe, becauſe it may the better nouriſh her. For this is one vndoubted rule, that when a Hawke doth refuſe to féede and tyre, ſhée is very vnluſty, and diſeaſed, and not one among a hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dreth of them, that doth recouer. And for mine owne part, in all my time, I haue recouered but one Falcon being ſo diſeaſed, and that by the meane and cure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, and by vſing this cauterie.</p>

               <p>HAwkes are accuſtomed to haue a certaine diſtillation or Catarre in their heads, becauſe when they ard hard ſléen withall, &amp; ſet in great heates, by long and painful flights, they eaſily take cold vpon the ſame, eyther through ſome vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py ſtormes of weather, or great windes, or by reaſon of the extreame cold of winter, &amp; chiefly when they are full of groſſe and naughty humors.</p>
               <p>Of this Catarre or diſtillation, ſundry times there grow a thouſand miſchiefes to thoſe poore birdes, and ſpecially the ſwelling of the head, with a kind of dropping humor, which is the cauſe many times, that the hawkes eyes become leſſe, and are contracted in a manner together. Beſide which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience, the nares alſo become to bée ſtuft and ſtopped with exceſſiue excrement that deſcendeth from the braine. All which euill accidents doe require, and ſtand néedfull of ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall cures before they can bée remoued, and the hawkes enioy their accuſtomed health.</p>
               <p>Wherefore firſt of all, it ſhall bée neceſſary to ſcowre your Hawke being thus affected and diſeaſed, with Butter prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in manner aforeſaide, or with Oyle Oliue prepared af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that faſhion, as I ſhall inſtruct yon in the Chapter of the Pantas.</p>
               <p>I haue in the Catarre of Falcons, (as alſo of other hawkes) diuerſe times vſed with great good fortune and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, to giue them of Agaricke two ſcruples, of Cyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon finely beaten, of the iuyce of Liquoriſh, of eyther one ſcruple, béeing make alſo into powder, and with a quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of hony of Roſes, to make all thoſe thinges aforeſaid into a pyll, as bigge as a Beane, for the largeſt ſort of hawks, and for other leſſe hawkes, halfe as bigge.

the morning, hauing nothing aboue in their gorges, holding my hawkeon the fiſt, vntill ſuch time the medicine beganne to worke, becauſe ſhée ſhould not caſt the ſcowring, (which then would doe her no pleaſure at all,) and after three houres then to féed her with ſome meat. You muſt remember, and note this very well, that if your Hawke to whom you giue this ſcowring bée greaſie, and ful of fleſh, you may boldly giue it her two or thrée mornings. But if ſhée bée poore, and low, then once or twice to allow this ſcowring, will very well ſuffice her. For there is euer reſpect to bée had of the ſtate of a hawke, when any vpward or downeward ſcowring is giuen them, for otherwiſe it will doe them greater miſchiefe than pleaſure.</p>
               <p>But when you perceiue your hawks head to ſwell, and her eyes to be full of dropping humors, and to waxe leſſe than na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally they were accuſtomed to be, by meane of the ſwelling of her head: It ſhall bée good, hauing giuen her this general ſcowring, that I haue ſpoken of, to ſcowre the head alone, and purge it with ſome deuiſe, to force her ſnite and ſnifle, as men doe accuſtom to ſneze: and to force her therunto, you may take Pepper, Cloues, &amp; muſtard ſéede, of each one a like quantitie, making them all into very fine powder, as is poſſible, &amp; then with a whiſtle of ſiluer, or other like mettell, (yea though it bée but a quill, it will ſerue the turne) being applyed vppon hernares, to blow it into hernares as ſtrongly as you may, to make it pierce the furtherin. And beſides that, you may rub and frot the pallate of your Hawke with the ſaid powder, and not féed her after it, vntill ſuch time ſhée hath left ſniting, and ſnifling. If you continue this practiſe thrée or foure dayes, your hawke ſhall recouer aſſuredly.</p>
               <p>To diſcharge the head of a Hawke, that is ſtuft with ill humor, Staueſaker which the Apothecaries do ſel in the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I haue found a very excellent thing, and of great force, giuing of it the biggeneſſe of a Beane vnto my Hawke,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:28166:121"/>
being emptie, and hauing nothing aboue. And withall I was accuſtomed to rubbe the pallate of her mouth, forcing alſo ſome parte of the powder to aſcend vppe into the head, by the hole that goeth to the braine: and after I had ſo done, would caſt my hawke to the pearch, vnhooding her. Which was no ſooner done, but you ſhould ſée her caſt a worlde of ſlimy filth and moiſt humour, and ſnyſe at her nares as faſt.</p>
               <p>But if it be ſo, that the aboundance of humors in the head, by none of theſe aforeſaid remedies will be remoued, applying them neuer ſo often, nor the miſchiefe ceaſe to vexe your hawk which you ſhall eaſily diſcerne by her ſlimy caſtings, and the aboundance of filth that will iſſue at her nares: then muſt you of force be driuen ventrouſly to flée to the actuall cauterie, &amp; with an yron button heat in the fire, to cauterize her vpon the head, vſing no leſſe iudgement and diſcretion therein, than the daintineſſe of the place requires, regarding the bone of the Hawkes head, which is not very ſtrong, or hard. And before you doe vſe the cauterie, it is neceſſary to cutte away thoſe feathers, that are growing about the place where you meane to beſtow your fire.</p>
               <p>If with this monſtrous moyſtneſſe of your hawkes head, there be ioyned a ſwelling, or the dropping of her eyes: in that caſe I doe thinke it beſt to beſtow your button vpon her head, iuſt betwixt her eyes, obſeruing the ſame order that I haue alreadie preſcribed you.</p>
               <p>When the nares of your hawke are ſtuft with filth, and ſurcharged with ſuch diſtillation from the head, as I haue ſpoken of: after a conuenient ſcowring, then ſhall it bée good to take Pepper and Muſtard ſéed beaten into fine powder, and putting it into a cleane linnen cloth, to ſtype it a ſpace in the ſtrongeſt vinegar you can gette: and that done, to beſtow ſome few droppes thereof vpon her nares, ſo as they may enter and pierce her nares. For truely this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:28166:121"/>
will ſo ſcowre and drie vp the humor, as it will do great pleaſure. But if ſo with theſe remedies and meanes you cannot reſolue it, then muſt you be faine to vſe the cauterie, not aloft vpon the head, but round about the nares, giuing her a little touch with the fire, ſomewhat below the nares, to make them more large, alwayes vſing the matter ſo carefully as you touch not the root or (or poret) of her nares. When you haue in this manner beſtowed your fire, and actuall cauterie, vntill ſuch time the paine doe ceaſe, and the eſcarre fall away, (which is nothing elſe but the cruſt that is growne there, by meane of the fire,) you muſt annoint the place with freſh but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and after that you haue ſo done, then procéede to the cure of it with the powder of Maſticke, or Olibanum.</p>
               <p>This is a very good remedy for the ſwelling in the head of a Hawke. Take Staueſacre, a quantity of Pepper, and a little Aloes Epaticke, beat theſe ſaid things into fine powder, and put them into the water of rew, where when it hath béen ſtéeped a ſpace in the ſaid liquor, with a little bombaſt or lint, bath your Hawkes nares twice a day, and you ſhall find it eaſe your hawke greatly, and ridde a great part of the filthie matter that bréedeth the ſtoppage in her head. If all theſe remedies which I haue alleadged generally, nor any one ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall medicine will preuaile, as I ſaid before: then muſt you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe your chiefeſt truſt in the cauterie, which muſt bée done eyther on the head with a cauterizing button, or about the nares with a néedle, or ſharp yron, fire hote, or ſome golden or ſiluer Inſtrument, of purpoſe made; applying after the fire, for the remouing of the Eſcarre, and the cure of the ſame, the remedies aforeſaid.</p>

               <p>BEſides thoſe other euils, there is a Cataract which dooth light vpon the eyes of a Hawke, whome we may tearm a ſuffuſion, a miſchiefe not eaſily remoued, and diuers times impoſſible to be recured, as namely, when it is grown too thick and ouerlong, hath béen ſuffered in the eye, without ſéeking re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy for it: but if it be not confirmed, then may it well bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied, and I my ſelfe haue cured ſundry hawkes affected with this euill.</p>
               <p>This euill accident doth happen, by meane of groſſe hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors in the head, which are wont to dimme and darken the ſight, and ſometimes cleane to put out the hawkes eye with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out redemption.</p>
               <p>It may bee, that the hoode is the cauſe and ground of this diſeaſe, for I neuer in my life remember that I ſaw any other birde or fowle troubled with it but onely the Falcon: and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happes it lights on her in chiefe, for that of all other, ſhée is moſt vſed to the hoode, and to be almoſt at no time vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooded.</p>
               <p>You muſt therefore haue an eye,<note place="margin">The Cure.</note> and eſpeciall regard to this inconuenience at the firſt, by giuing one or two morninges a ſcowring of Aloes, or of Agaricke, to ſcowre your Hawke withall, becauſe if you ſhould aduenture vpon any ſharpe or hard painefull medicine, applying it to the eye of your hawke, it would perhaps cauſe a great repaire of euil humors, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents to the place diſeaſaid.</p>
               <p>When you haue giuen this ſcowring of Aloes, or Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke, to remoue the matter from the eye, you muſt vſe a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der made of waſht Aloes, finely beaten, one ſcruple, and of Sugar Candie two ſcruples, blowing out this powder into your Hawkes eyes thrée or foure times in a day, with the Pipe or quill aforeſaid.

<pb n="236" facs="tcp:28166:123"/>
and whileſt you do miniſter this receit, it ſhall bee good ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to bath the eye with the vrine of a little boy.</p>
               <p>If by theſe medicines aforeſaid, the webbe of the eye will not bee remoued, we muſt be driuen to vſe a ſtronger receipt, which is this:</p>

                  <note place="margin">Another remedy.</note>Take a new ſaid egge, and roſt it ſo long vntill the white of it become like milke.

               <p>Laſt of all, if theſe thinges auayle not to the cure, I do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend and allow aboue all the reſt, that you take the iuyce of Celendine rootes, making them cleane from the earth that doth vſe to hang to the moores: then ſcrape away the outmoſt rynde and pill of the roote, and vſe the iuyce to your Hawke. Truely I haue found this to bee of ſingular force and vertue in the like accident.</p>
               <p>It ſhall not bée amiſſe, in this and ſuch like affections and ill paſſions of the eye of a Hawke, to bath her eyes often with roſe-water, wherein haue béen boyled the ſéeds of Fenygreke. But you muſt remember, that this water or coli<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

This deuiſe may you vſe to bath your Hawkes eye withall, vntill ſuch time ſhe be recouered, féeding her mean while with good meats, and ſuch as are light of diſgeſtion.</p>
               <p>Hawkes are of ſo noble and excellent a nature, as the moſt part of medicines that you doe apply to the hurtes and cures of men, you may boldly beſtow on hawkes, as thinges verie holeſome for them, as by their working will be moſt euidently ſéene and perceyued: yet muſt there bee a diſcretion vſed, in

               <p>It hapneth diuers times, that through the catarre, and paine of the head and eyes, there lights vpon the eares of a Hawke ſo mortall and deadly an apoſtume, as ſeldom when, though there be great care vſed about the cure, ſhée may bée brought to perfect ſtate or recouered. And this procéedeth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the miſchiefe lies ſo neare a neighbour to the braine, as before it can breake or be cleanſed outwardly, it cauſeth the Hawke to periſh, Beſides that, it is very hard to apply medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines in that place: but if the hawke bée of ſo ſtrong a nature, that ſhée brook the breathing and rupture of this diſeaſe, which you ſhall perceiue by the quitture and filth that dooth iſſue from her eares, giue her this remedie, which is a very noble receit, and approued of me oftentimes, as well in men, as in Hawkes, to my great commendation and glory.</p>

               <p>The Wine of Pomegranats is a moſt excellent remedy in this miſchiefe, confected with thoſe things aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>Butter well coyled and beaten in a morter of lead, one howre at the leaſt, and afterwards powred into the hawkes eares reaſonable hote, twice or thrice a day, is a very good remedie.</p>

               <p>THe chaps and mouth of a hawke is ſubiect to ſundry diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, and in the hawkes mouth there are wont to grow certaine white peeces of fleſh, and ſometimes tending ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to blacke, which doe hinder the hawke from her feeding, by meane whereof without any other euident cauſe, ſhée be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth leane and low. Wherefore it ſhall bee very neceſſary to looke into her mouth ſomtimes, both in the pallate, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the tong, beeauſe that many times, there eſpecially, doe grow vp certaine péeces of fleſh like in ſhape to a grain of pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, ſometimes leſſe, ſometimes bigger than a pepper graine, which it ſhall be neceſſary to cut away, eyther with a payre of cyſers, if you may commodiouſly doeit, or with Roch allome burnt, or with a drop of oyle of brimſtone, applyed vpon a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle cotton, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> an yron vnto the place, taking away the corrupt fleſh. You muſt mundiſie the place with hony of Roſes, and bumbaſt, or lynt, vntill you ſée the quicke fleſh vnderneath it, then afterwards vnto the hony of roſes, you may apply and adde a litle pouder of maſticke, or incenſe, to conſolidate the wound, waſhing it ſometimes among with white wine.</p>
               <p>Moreouer and beſides this, there is wont to happen vnto hawkes in the mouth, a certaine frownce or impediment, which doth hinder their féeding, as the other péeces of fleſh do, of which I haue ſpoken before. This frownce may bée verie well perceyued and diſcerned with the eye, and will appeare alſo by the féeding of the hawke.</p>
               <p>Diuers times this kind of euill is cured with hony of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, &amp; with the powder of nut-ſhels bound in a péece of linnen cloth, well bathed and ſtiped together, and thruſt vnder the hote ymbers vntill it may be brought vnto fine powder: this may you continue twice a day, as long as ſhall be néedfull.</p>
               <p>But if this will not ſerue the turne, it ſhall bée very neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to mortifie, and kill the frownce with Aqua fortis, ſuch as

               <p>After you haue mortified the frownce or canker with Aqua fortis, as I haue told you, then muſt you mundifie and conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidate it with hony of roſes, which will cure it out of hand.</p>

But you muſt well regarde whether the Fleſh bée good or no, and with a toole fitte for it to ſearch and cutte away the deade fleſh, for otherwiſe it will doe little pleaſure, and the Hawke ſhould bée aſſured to ſuffer great paynes, and yet to die at laſt. Hauing mundified the wound with the receit aforeſaid, bath it onely with hony of Roſes, &amp; it will diſpatch the Cure.</p>

But many times it ſo falleth out, that the beake of a hawke is hindred &amp; offended with this kind of euill, and not the mouth ſo much, in ſuch ſort as the Hawke cannot well féede, by meane this miſchiefe doth ſo fret and eate the horne of her chappe and beake. For re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy of that, you muſt take a ſharpe knife, and pare away as much of the beake as is corrupted: but if the malady or frownce haue eaten very farre vnder the horne of the beake, it is not ſufficient to cut it away with a ſharpe knife, as farre as the canker hath eaten, but you muſt afterwardes annoint the place with hony of Roſes twice or thrice: and in ſo doing the Hawke ſhall recouer and doe well, for the hony of Roſes wil both mundifie and incarne.</p>
               <p>Sometimes a hawkes beake or chappe doth ouergrow ſo much, as it is very neceſſary to cope it with an yron, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward to ſharpen the beake with a knife, taking away ſo much as is néedefull for the better féeding of your Hawke, but in any wiſe you muſt not meddle with the nether chappe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that doth not commonly grow ſo faſt, nor ſo farre as to hinder your hawkes féeding.

                  <note place="margin">The way to waſh oyle.</note>My accuſtomed manner of waſhing it was, to put it in an earthen potte, that had a litle hole in the very bottom of it, of purpoſe made rounde, whereby it might the better bée ſtopte with the toppe of my finger: then do I conuey into this potte that quantitie of Oyle, which I meane to waſhe in it, and with cleare water do there coile it together with a wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den platter, or a ſpoone, that the water waxeth ſomwhat dark with it: after which remouing my finger, the water paſſeth away by the hole, the Oyle remaining behinde, and ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming aloft, as it is the nature of it to do. And thus do I fixe, ſeauen or eight times: ſo long vntill I perceiue the Oyle to haue no filth left in it at all. Then of this Oyle thus prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, I beſtowe vppon my Hawke that hath the Pantas, filling therewith a chickens gutte waſht very cleane, of an inch long and ſomwhat more, for a Falcon and Goſhawke: but for other leſſe Hawkes of a leſſe length, faſt knit at both endes with a threed, to the end the Oyle may not iſſue out, which gutte I conuay into the Hawkes throte, after ſhe hath caſt: and is emptie aboue and in the pannell both, holding her on the fiſte till ſhe make a mewte: and one houre after ſhe hath left mewting, then I féede her with ſome ſlipper fleſh, as the heart of a Calfe, or a Pullets legge, refuſing to vſe olde Pigeons and Sparowes, becauſe they are ouer hote meate, vnleſſe happily the Hawke were very low and poore, but being hie and full of fleſh, thoſe other meates aforeſaid, are not alone holeſome, and ſufficient for her, but they will be much better, being waſht in water of Bugloſſe, and wroong drie in a linnen cloth, and then minged with the powder of
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:28166:126"/>
Sugar Candie, vſing this order ſixe or eight dayes, or more, euery other day till my Hawke recouer: giuing her euerie third or fourth day a cotton caſting with Cubebes, &amp; cloues, to ſcowre and diſcharge her of ſuch moiſt humors as diſtilleth from her head, which ſometimes (as I haue ſaid before) is the chiefe and originall ground of this diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>Beſides this remedy, there is one other very good, and that is butter, and Larde well ſliſed, and waſhed in ſundry Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, till they become very cleane, and White, which you may kéepe in Roſe-water, vntill you haue occaſion to vſe it.</p>
               <p>Of theſe being thus prepared and conſerued, you may take as you haue néed, for euery ſcowring ſuch a quantity, as will ſerue to make a pyll or pellet, ſo great as you may well conuey into your Hawkes throat, vſing it in maner and time aforeſaid: giuing her now and then among that ſcowring of Cubebs and Cloues, as well for the reaſon already allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, as alſo becauſe of her liquid meat and ſlipper féeding vpon thoſe hearts, ſo bathed and ſtéeped in water. For Cubebs and Cloues will greatly comfort the ſtomacke and gorge of your Hawke.</p>
               <p>I haue found by experience that oyle of ſwéete Almonds is of wondrous efficacy in the cure of this diſeaſe, giuing it in a chickens gut as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>If theſe remedies which I haue ſhewed doe not preuaile, nor performe the perfect cure of your diſeaſed hawke, ne yet do make her mewte, which hapned at no time to mée in all my experience and practiſe. But when there is no remedy to bée had at all, I can well allow the vſe of Agaricke with a cotton caſting, becauſe Agaricke is of great force to cauſe a Hawke to ſliſe. But if for all this, the griefe doe dayly procéed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, then doe I thinke good that you beſtow a Cantery vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your Hawkes head, betwixt her eyes, &amp; eake at her nares, ſpecialy if there be any imperfection in them. Some men are of opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> for the cure of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pantas you ſhould giue your hawk

two inches of a Lucerts tayle, newly cut off, conueying it into your hawkes gorge, and afterwards ſetting her in ſome dark place, till ſhée haue caſt, and then to giue her goats milke with the bloud of a Doue. Otherſome Writers doe will and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe to let the hawke bloud in the necke.</p>
               <p>But I for my part haue neither tried the one nor the other, if I ſhall tell you the truth of the matter, becauſe I doe not at all like of theſe deuiſes: but doe aſſure you, that with thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remedies and receits, which I haue taught you in this Chapter of the Pantas (I meane the ſcowrings, and the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie) I haue done very much good, and recouered my hawks of this diſeaſe, and therefore doe recommend you to them, as vndoubted experiments.</p>
               <p>Betony reduced into the forme of an Electuarie with hony is a very good remedie for this griefe, as well in men, as in Hawkes.</p>
               <p>One other remedy which I find in an Italian Author, is this. Take Mummy, Rheubarbe, Saffron, &amp; Sugar Candy, make all theſe into powder, giuing it to your Hawke, for the ſpace of eight dayes at leaſt in a chickens ſkinne, if ſhée will take it, if not, force it into her. And while you miniſter this medicine vnto her, all that time let her not be borne on the fiſt: and withall among ſometimes, giue waſht freſh butter with ſugar candy, and ſometimes a cotton caſting with incenſe within it. But I doe more commend to giue her Bole Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niacke in a Pill with hony.</p>
               <p>Theſe remedies no doubt are very good and ſoueraigne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Pantas of a Hawke. Make you choice of them, but let the cautery be the laſt refuge, for that is an extremity. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member this rule of Phiſicke, that euer it is beſt to begin with the weakeſt: for if they will profite and do ſufficient good, in vaine it were to charge nature with the ſtrongeſt receites, which are rough and churliſh in working.</p>

               <head>Of the infirmity and diſeaſe in the gorge of a Hawke. when ſhee doth caſt her gorge.</head>
               <p>SVndry are the diſeaſes that Hawkes are peſtred withal, by meane of the indiſpoſition of the gorge, when the parte is out of tune: among which, the moſt ordinary and perillous is the caſting of the gorge, when a Hawke doth caſt her meat vndiſgeſted, in the ſelfe ſame forme ſhe receyued it: or elſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and of a loathſome ſauour, both which they do many times.</p>
               <p>If ſhée caſt it cleane, and not ſtinking, but of good ſmell, there is no great feare of the matter, nor any great danger: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it may procéede by mean ſome ſmall bone is croſſed and turned in the gorge of the Hawke, which doth cauſe her to caſt it againe for her more eaſe and quiet: Wherefore in this caſe it ſhall bée good for the more ſurety, and to know the worſt of the accident that may happen thereby, to beare your hawke to the water, or to offer her abaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of water, to trie whether ſhe will bowze or no. For by bowzing, beſides the good that ſhe ſhall receiue by it, you ſhall haue euident proofe and vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſhew of her diſeaſe, and that indéede ſhée is ſicke, and doth ſtand in néede of Phyſicke: but if ſhée bowze not at all, it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth her to bée in good tune.</p>
               <p>Thoſe accidents are wont to happen by meane of ouer much moyſture and humidity, and through exceſſiue rotten humors engendred in the gorge.</p>
               <p>Wherefore if the Hawke caſt her meat well ſauouring, and of good colour, neyther ſtinking to ſmell, nor loathſome to viewe, and doe bowze after it, it ſhall bée good to heat and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort the gorge with the powder of Nutmegges and Cloues, with a quantity of Muſke, all enwrapped in a péece of fine cotton or bombaſt, giuing it to the hawke when ſhée is emptie
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:28166:128"/>
pancid, as cuſtome is to doe, holding her on the fiſt, vntill ſhée put ouer her ſaid caſting into her gorge. Then two howres after ſhe hath caſt it againe, it ſhall be very neceſſary to feede her with young Doues, giuing but halfe a gorge, or ſomwhat leſſe at a time: &amp; at night when hée ſups her, to let her plume a little, and if the Hawke will bowze, to giue her leaue to doe it, for truely it will be very holeſome for her. By this meanes I promiſe you, I haue recouered ſundry ſicke hawkes, and chiefly Sparrowhawkes.</p>
               <p>I haue ouer and beſides this, vſed with great good ſucceſſe good Roſe water altred with a quantity of powder of cloues, and muſke, preparing it after this manner.</p>
               <p>I haue taken Roſe water two ounces, powder of Cloues two ſcruples, of fine muſke fiue graines: and of this haue I giuen my hawke fiue ounces, or thereabout, after that as my hawke hath béen eyther poore or hie in ſtate, holding her on the fiſt, vntill ſhe hath made a mewte.</p>
               <p>This medicine will bring her to a good appetite, a ſwéete breath, and will beſides all theſe ſcowre very well.</p>
               <p>But if that which ſhe doth caſt, be corrupted and ſtinking: ouer and beſides the foreſaid remedies, which indéede are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent good, I can allow well that you take the roote of Celi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donie, or Celondine, remouing away the vpper rynde, and pill off the roote vntill it looke redde, and droppe againe, then to infuſe it in a quantity of luke warme water, ſtirring the roote vp and downe in the water, to cauſe it to receiue the effect and quality of the Celydonie the more. Of which root you muſt (after you haue ſo done) conuey a pellet as bigge as a beane for the huger ſort of hawkes, into the beake of your Hawke, thruſting it downe with your forefinger into the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry gorge of her, to the end it may the better deſcend into your Hawke. Beſides this, it is very good to open her beake, &amp; conuey into her one ſpoonefull of the water aforeſaid, not all at once, but at twice or thrice, cloſing faſt her clappes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:28166:128"/>
becauſe ſhe may the better kéepe it, and not caſt it vppe preſently.</p>
               <p>This béeing done, kéepe her a ſpace vpon the fiſte, vntill the roote and licout bée well ſetled in her gorge. After which, caſt her on the pearch in ſuch a place where is no reſort, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of people, Dogges, Chickens, Cattes, or other ſuch like things, to the end you may the better diſcerne her ſcow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring: and beſides, that ſhee may haue the leſſe cauſe to bate. There let her ſtand vntil ſhée hath caſt all the roote which ſhée receyued, and that the water hath made her mewt, and ſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſe ſufficiently, which will doe her very great good. Then after two howres it ſhall bee well to giue her a yong Rat or Mouſe, newly ſtripped out of the ſkinne hote, and for lacke thereof, a young Pigeon, whome you ſhall kill, by throwing her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly againſt the ground, with the raines downeward, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the bloud may gather together and ſtand: whereof féed your Hawke giuing her the heart alſo, and the raines thereof, without any more allowance of any of the Pigeons fleſh. When ſhee hath diſpatched and ridde this beaching of the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons heart and bloud, or of the young Rat, then giue her in like manner the like quantity, onely of the dead Doue: onely twice a day to a Sparowhawk, but to a Falcon or Goſhawk, foure or fiue beachings in one day, euer obſeruing the ſelfe ſame order that I haue preſcribed you.</p>
               <p>The next morning you may, if néede bée, in a little lint, or flaxe, or ſuch deuiſe, giue a ſcowring of Incenſe or Oliba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, I meane the leaues of it bruſed in your hand, as ſmal as is poſſible, giuing her but a ſmall gorge, to the end that towardes the Euening, you may allow her a reaſonable Supper.</p>
               <p>By this vſage and order haue I cured ſundry Hawes of mine owne, and other mens.</p>
               <p>You muſt note y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> when theſe remedies aforeſaid do not profite
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:28166:129"/>
nor doe the feate, and that the Hawke doth caſt her more than twice, then is it a deſperate caſe, and ſo much the worſe, if the Hawke bée low and poore, for then in that caſe haue I ſéene very few or none recured.</p>
               <p>Neuertheleſſe I haue ſometimes ſéen a maruaile wrought in this caſe, by making the greater kind of hawkes, as Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, Gerfalcons, and ſuch like, drunk with a ſpoonful or two of ſtrong Malmeſey, conueied by force into her gorge: but to the leſſer hawks you muſt not giue ſo much of the malmeſie, but in leſſe quantity. Which done, they haue béen placed vpon a bed or a cuſhion, for on the pearch they cannot ſtand, being drowſie, but will lie as thinges in a trance for the ſpace of a quarter of an howre, and many neuer recouer themſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, but if happily any doe after they are thus dealt withall recouer and ſliſe, and ſcowre away their medicine, no queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that hawke ſhall throughly recouer: then is it good to giue her of the bloody parts of a Pigeon vſed in that manner as I foreſhewed you, but this dangerous medicine is not to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, but in deſperate caſes.</p>

               <p>IT hapneth ſometimes that a Hawke can hardly put ouer her meat, which may bée diſcerned by this, when in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſhe hath of her ſupper aboue. This miſfortune chanceth partly by reaſon her meat was ouerdrie, and (as wée may ſay) ſo hard baked in the gorge, as ſhee could not put it ouer, and partly againe, for that the Hawke cannot endue ſufficiently, neyther yet dooth fill in the Pannell as ſhée ought to doe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="249" facs="tcp:28166:129"/>In the firſt caſe, I haue holpen diuers with giuing the Hawke water at will, to bowze her pleaſure, bathing beſides her féet and pearch with freſh cold water: which not ſeruing the turne, I haue thruſt my forefinger into her gorge, and ſo holpen it along, and ſometimes my little finger, or a wax can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle: and by that meanes haue cauſed her to fill in the ventricle ſooner than otherwiſe ſhée would haue done. The weakeneſſe of which part diuerſe times is a cauſe that the Hawke doth not well endue, nor fill in the Panel.</p>
               <p>Somewhiles againe I haue vſed, and chiefly to Falcons to giue a ſcowring in Cotton of powder of Mummye, prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of Cloues and Nutmegs, rolling aloft vpon the cotton a little lynt of Flaxe, becauſe they ſhould the ſooner caſt it. And by this meanes haue recouered them preſently.</p>
               <p>When a hawke doth endew but ſlowly, and hath by that means ſmall luſt to her meat, you muſt thus do, to make her more eager, &amp; ſharp, wrap her meat in the ſéed of <hi>Naſturcium,</hi> or water craſſies, and ſo cauſe her to take it. But this muſt he vſed only in winter, by reaſon that kind of ſéed is very hote.</p>
               <p>The meat being thus vſed, will bring her to be very ſharpe ſette, and cauſe her to be well breathed, and beſides make her luſty, for indéed it is a medicine very excellent, and of infinite vertue.</p>
               <p>Beſides, ſometimes the gorge is ſo out of tune, as it is the cauſe that the hawke at her accuſtomed hours doth not caſte, but retayneth her caſting within her. Whereupon it behoues ſome art to be vſed to make her caſt. The next remedy for that (as I haue ſaid already) is to giue the roote of Celendine, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared in forme aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>Moreouer muſtard ſeede, otherwiſe called Senuy ſéede, is an excellent &amp; a preſent remedy for that miſchiefe, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyed into the Hawkes throat of the bignes of a beane, to the huger ſort of hawkes: but to the leſſer hawkes a leſſe quantity ought to be giuen: &amp; beſides that, one graine of Cloues, with a little pure Aloes well waſht, albeit that will ſomewhat vexe
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:28166:130"/>
and wrong the hawke in this care.</p>
               <p>But aboue all other, doe I hommend and preferre a ſcow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring conueyed into a little cotton caſting, that is made of the powder of Aloes Epaticke waſht, of Cloues, Nutmegs and Ginger, of ech of theſe equall portions, roling the Cotton in a little Tow or Flaxe, making it as hard with your hand as you may, &amp; then rolling it in the powder of cloues, and forcing it downe the Hawkes throat: and preſently you ſhall ſée your hawke caſt it vp with the olde caſting which ſhee had before. This, beſides the benefite of that, will comfort greatly, and ſtrengthen the gorge, and ſcowre the head of all ſuch euill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors as are there, ſurcharging the ſame. The vſe of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe now and then will bee very neceſſary and beneficiall to your Hawkes without doubt.</p>
               <p>If your Hawke will not caſt, take Aloes, Pepper, powder of Cloues, and hony of Roſes, making of all theſe a long pyll, and as bigge as a caſting, giue it your hawke, and ſhée ſhall preſently caſt vpon the taking of it.</p>

               <p>You may perceiue theſe wormes to plague and trouble your hawke, when you ſée her caſt her gorge, when her breath ſtinkes, when ſhee trembleth and writheth her traine, when ſhée croakes in the night, offereth with her beake to her panel, when her mewt is not cleane, white, nor in ſuch aboundance as it ought to be. And beſides all this, when your Hawke
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:28166:130"/>
keepes at one ſtay, and is low of fleſh continually.</p>
               <p>In this caſe it behooues you to deſtroy theſe wormes eyther with a ſcowring of waſht Aloes Epaticke, Muſtard ſeede, and Agarick, of each one equall portions, vſing to giue it as I haue taught you before. Or elſe by miniſtring the pouder of the Gal of a Bore pig dryed in the ſmoake: or if theſe fayle, to giue the powder of Harts horne being dried.</p>
               <p>White Dittander, <hi>Hiera pigra minore,</hi> (for there are ſundry kinds of it) of each two drams, Aloes Epaticke well waſhte thrée drams, Agaricke, Saffron, of each one dram, being al in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate with hony of Roſes, is an excellent remedie againſt the wormes. You muſt kéepe it well, and giue Falcons, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhawkes and ſuch like, the bignes of a beane, but to Sparow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawkes, and the leſſer ſort of Hawkes, as much as a peaſe, in forme of a pyll, thruſting it downe your Hawkes throat, kée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping her after it a ſpace on the fiſt, till ſhe haue ſliſed and mew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her medicine, feeding her afterward with good meat after your wonted maner. And this ſhall recouer her, and kill the wormes.</p>
               <p>For the ſame diſeaſe it is very good to giue a ſcowring of white Dittander, Aloes Epaticke well waſht, Cubebes foure or fiue, a few flakes of ſaffron, enwrapped in a morſell of fleſh, to cauſe the hawke the better to take it.</p>
               <p>This receit no doubt will both make the hawke to ſlyſe and mewt, and withall recouer her. For it is an approued remedy againſt the worms, and ſpecially when the hawke doth writh and wreſt her traine.</p>

               <p>NOw I am entred in ſpéech of worms, I thinke it good to write ſomwhat of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Filanders, to giue both knowledge &amp;
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:28166:131"/>
cure of them. Albeit theſe worms do not al depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of the gorge, for their natural place, &amp; being is near the the rains of a hawk, where they be enwrapped in a certaine thin net or ſkin, ſeueral by themſelues, apart from eyther gut or gorge.</p>
               <p>Theſe Filanders (as the very name doth import,) are ſmal as thréeds, &amp; one quarter of an inch long, and more proper and peculiar to Falcons, than to any other hawke or fowle. And this makes me to thinke that they are naturally allowed the Falcon, becauſe indéed they doe not at all times vexe &amp; trouble the hawks, but now and then, &amp; eſpecially when the hawk is poor &amp; low of fleſh. But if ſhe be hie &amp; luſty, then by reaſon of the abundance of nouriſhment &amp; food that they receyue from the hawke, they moleſt her not at all, but rather do her good: &amp; my reaſon is this. I cannot be induced to thinke that nature (who doth vſe to make nothing but to ſome end and purpoſe) hath produced and placed thoſe Filanders in that part of the falcon for naught, or to hurt the hawke. But how &amp; in what ſort they pleaſure or profit the hawke, I could neuer yet reach by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture.</p>
               <p>When they are troubled and grieued with the Filanders, you ſhall firſt diſcerne it by the pouerty of the hawkes, by ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling their traines, &amp; by certain twitches and ſtarts that they will make, ſtrayning the fiſt or pearch with their pownce, and laſtly by their crooking in the night time, which kind of noyſe they vtter, when the Filanders pricke and gripe them within. For when they want their ſuſtenance, which they can by no meanes haue when the hawks are low and poore, then do they endeauour to rend and breake that ſlender net wherein they are naturally incloſed, to iſſue out to ſéeke their victuals ſome other where. And many times it hapneth, that, not ſéeing to it in time, and at the firſt, they paſſe through their web, &amp; crall vp as hie as the very heart, and other principall partes of the Hawke, whoreof it muſt néeds conſequently follow, that ſhée periſheth without redemption.</p>
               <p>I haue ſometimes ſéene this peſtilent worme by piercing
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:28166:131"/>
and breaking the bed wherein nature hath layde them, aſcend vp ſo hie as they came forth, &amp; appeared at the Hawkes beake and mouth.</p>
               <p>Wherefore it ſhall be neceſſary to reſpect the cure of theſe Fylanders, not by killing them as you would doe other wormes, (for then happily being dead, and rotting in that pléece, from whence they cannot paſſe away with the hawks mewte, they would there corrupt &amp; breed a filthie impoſtume in her) but the way that you muſt take, is, by making them drunke with ſome medicine to entertaine them in ſuch forte, as they may not offend or gripe the hawke.</p>
               <p>The beſt remedy that can bée deuiſed for it, is to take a Garlick head, pilling from the cloues therof the vtmoſt rind: which done, you ſhall w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> ſome ſmall yron toole or bodkin heat in the fire, pierce the Cloues, and make certaine holes in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And afterwards ſtéeping them in oyle at leaſt thrée dayes, giue your Falcon one of them down her throat: for the Cloue of Garlicke vſed in this manner as I tell you, will ſo enrage &amp; aſtone the Filanders, that for thirty or forty dayes after they will not at all moleſt your Hawke Whereupon ſome Falco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners when their Falcons bee low and poore, once in a moneth doe of ordinarie giue them a cloue of Garlicke for feare of the Filanders, to preuent the worſt, and truly to good effect. And for that very purpoſe and cauſe, are ſeldome or neuer without Garlicke ſtéeped in Oyle, where the longer they lye, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and more medicinable they are.</p>
               <p>Thus muſt you deale with thoſe Filanders that lie in the raynes. But there is one other kind of Filanders lying in the guts or panel of a hawke, which are long, ſmall and white worms, as though they had dropt out of the raines of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hawk. If you will deſtroy thoſe Filanders, you muſt take Aloes E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paticke, fylings of yron, Nutmegs, &amp; ſo much hony as will ſerue to frame a pyll, which pyll you ſhall giue your hawke in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> morning, as ſoon as ſhée hath caſt, holding her on the fiſt for the ſpace of an howre after. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> caſt her on the perch, &amp; when
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:28166:132"/>
you geſſe her to haue ſliſed her fill, and mewted it cleane, then féede her with good hote meate.</p>
               <p>There are beſides theſe, yet one other ſort of Filanders in the guts of a hawke alſo, which cauſe a hawk to caſt her gorge as ſoone as ſhée hath fed, and doe make her ſtrong breathed: for them prouide this remedie.</p>
               <p>Take Aloes Epaticke, &amp; wormwood made into very ſmal powder, temper the powder with oyle of bitter Almonds: and that done, annoint therewith the flankes and ſides of your hawke. And if you like not the oyle, for greſing your Falcons feathers and plumes, compound thoſe foreſaid powders with Vineger at the fire: but it is certaine that the Oyle is the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter far of both, and more proper to this diſeaſe,</p>
               <p>If you can, giue your hawke oyle of bitter Almonds, and not diſquiet her gorge, and after it beſtow the other cure vpon her, with the annointing her as I haue taught you, you ſhall find it the moſt perfect remedy that may be againſt thoſe Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers that lodge in the guts and bowels of your hawke.</p>

               <p>THe liuer of a hawk is oftentimes enflamed by ouermuch bating and trauell, as it hapneth not ſeldome to Falcons brought from far and forrain countries by ſhip, &amp; again, when they be impatient and bedlam in the mew, or when they flée ſurcharged w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> ouer great bels. For the ouerbelling of a Falcon puts her to a greater paine and trouble than néeds. By theſe, &amp; ſuch like occaſions, hawkes become hote liuered. Againe ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it hapneth by meane of an Apoſtume, which is engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred eyther by ſome pricke of a thorne, or the ſtripe of an other hawkes pownce, by crabbing w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> her. For when they haue ſuch a ſtripe or pricke, the ſkin is broken outwardly, but the bloud remaining corrupt within, engendreth the apoſtume. Many times this diſeaſe of the liuer procéedes of ſome bruiſe againſt the ground, or in a trée or the encounter with another fowle.</p>
               <p>You ſhal perceiue this diſeaſe of the inflammation of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> liuer

when your hawke ſtandeth melancholy, caſteth not at her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed and wonted howres, by her fowle caſtings, by her ſtinking and ill coloured mewts (whereof I ſpake before) by her labouring thicke in the panell, and by féeling of her: For her pulſe doth beat as the pulſe of a man that hath a Feauer. Moreouer, her mewt is as blacke as any incke. The diſeaſe is the moſt peſtilent and dangerous of all others.</p>
               <p>If the heat of her liuer procéede of too much bating, or broi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with her ſelfe, you may eaſily cure her with foure or fiue good liquid and cooling gorges, as to féede her with the legge of a Pullet, or the heart of a Veale, bathed in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Bugloſſe, Bowrage, Harts tongue, and ſuch like wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, it is very Soueraigne to waſh her meate in the iuyce of Henbane, or elſe (that which doth much more refreſh the Hawke) to take a little larde or bacon without the rinde, and well waſht and conſerued in good Roſe water, and laſt of all rolled in powder of Sugar Candy. With this receyte more than with any other, am I accuſtomed to recomfort and refreſh my hawke when ſhée is ſick of her liuer. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the other medicines are very wholeſome and good. And ſpecially good freſh butter, or Oyle waſhte and prepared, as I taught you in the former chapter.</p>
               <p>But when the miſchiefe of the liuer is engendred by ſome pricke of a thorne, or the crabbing with ſome other hawkes or foule, as diuers times it happeneth to the Falcon, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with a Hearon, when they binde together in the aire.

You muſt roll your hawkes meat in this mummy prepared thrée or foure times, and ſo giue it to your hawke: and if ſhée refuſe to take it of her ſelfe then conuey it into her by force, with a cotton caſting, foure or fiue dayes one after an other.</p>
               <p>If ſhée be ill affected in her liuer by a bruiſe againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground or againſt a trée, or by encounter with ſome other fowle, then
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:28166:133"/>
take Rewbarbe of the beſt one ſcruple, drie it vpon a hote yron pan, vntill it may be made into fine powder, of that giue in a canuas caſting, the weight of two graines of wheate to your larger ſort of hawkes, but for the leſſe hawke, the one half wil ſuffice.

               <head>Of diſeaſes that happen to Hawkes feet, and firſt as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the ſwelling of a Hawkes foot.</head>
               <p>SOmetimes the arme and foot of a Hawke doth ſwell, by means of ill humors that deſcend and drop down through weakenes of the foot or arme, through ouer great trauel &amp; toile, through age, by reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſome blow or bruiſe receiued long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. This miſchiefe may eaſily bée diſcerned aſwell by view of eye, as touch of hand: for beſides that you ſhall plainely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it in ſight, you may feel a very great heat in the member, ſo as ſometimes the Hawke is vnable to ſtand on her legs for paine and auguiſh thereof. Wherefore it is neceſſary to looke to it with all care that may be, and to vſe the matter, as the humor bréed not the goote, or the pinne, which oftentimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to thoſe poore birdes to their great and continuall plague.</p>
               <p>The way to cure it, is to giue the humor a vent by launſing it, and after that to recomfort the member, by ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> annointing it with the white of an egge, vinegar, and roſewater, well bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and coyled together, or elſe with very good olde oyle of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liues, ſuch as you can come by out of a bottle wherein oyle hath béen long time kept: for thoſe drops that hardly come out of the bottle, are farre better than any new freſh oyle, and are more medicinable in this caſe.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, beſides the ceaſing of the paine, to delay the ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, you ſhall find it very excellent good, to take the powder of <hi>Acacia,</hi> &amp; <hi>terra Sigillata,</hi> of eyther foure drams, incorporating them with vineger, the white of an egge, Roſe-water, and the iuyce of Nightſhade, as much as will ſuffice to make this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guent ſoft and delicate, and with this receite to annoint the

hawks foot or arme oftentimes for a ſpace: for this vnguent no queſtion, will both take away the immoderate ach and paine, as alſo mollifie and delay the ſwelling, and ſo reſtore your hawke to her former plight againe. [But aboue all there is none more certaine then to take oyle of bay, and beating it wel with <hi>aqua v tae,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Addition.</note> annoint the hawks féet or legs therwith.]</p>
               <p>An other approued medicine is, to annoint the ſwelling of your hawkes foot with <hi>Oleum Petraelium</hi> (which is the oyle of a Rocke) and with oyle of white Lillies, taking of each of theſe like quantity, the blood of a pigeon, and the talow of a candle, heating all theſe together a little at the fire. This vnguent wil throughly reſolue the miſchief, or at the leaſt, by reſoluing the thinneſt humors, bring it to that paſſe, as you ſhall ſée the groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt parts well digeſted which you ſhal perceiue by the white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and hardnes thereof.

<pb n="268" facs="tcp:28166:139"/>
long, on the toppe whereof they faſten a péece of waxe, either red, or gréene, &amp; with that (while the Hawk doth weather her) they take away the liſe and mytes crawling vpon the fethers, ſo as before the hawk be throughly dried and weathered, what with the waxe and their own dropping away, there wil not be a vermine leff about the hawke. For the pepper and water doth ſo much diſeaſe them, as they are enforced to leaue their accuſtomed lodgings: then the heat of the Sun or fire, helps to make them ſhew themſelues: and the waxe by cleauing to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vtterly and clearely rids the hawke of them.</p>
               <p>I haue ſéene ſome Falconers adde vnto the pepper &amp; water, a quantity of Staueſager, as an enemy to the liſe and mites, by meane of ſtrength and force that is in it: and I take it to be very neceſſary to be added in this medicine to the Pepper for the better diſpatch of thoſe vile vermines which doe ſo much vexe and annoy the hawke, as ſhée can by no means kéepe her ſelfe in good ſtate whileſt ſhée is incumbred with them.</p>
               <p>You muſt remember to pepper you hawke in this maner as I haue ſhewed you in a very warm ſunny day, when there is no wind at all blowing in the ſkie. But if by fortune you be enforced to doe it in another time when the weather is cold and the Sunne not ſhining, then muſt you ſet your hawke by the fire to weather her, and drie her feathers: but neither muſt the fire bée ouer hote, nor the gorge of your hawk towards the fire, whereof I haue giuen you aduertiſement before, in thoſe precepts which are to be obſerued of a good Falconer. For if you ſet her with the gorge to the fire, no doubt ſhée wil receiue no ſmall harme and inconuenience thereby, and for the moſt part death enſues of it.</p>
               <p>In the Summer time you may diſpatch your hawke of the liſe &amp; mites with <hi>Auripigmentum</hi> beate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into very fine powder, beſtowing and ſifting it betwixt the hawks feathers w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> your fingers, &amp; ſpecially in thoſe places where they do moſt vſually haunt, alwayes hauing regard that none of the powder come into your hawks eyes for offending her.

               <head>Of miſfortunes that happen to Hawkes in the mew. And firſt of all, of their laying egges in the mew.</head>
               <p>IN the mew hawks are ſubiect to ſundry accidents. Among all which (to paſſe ouer the greaſines and exceſſiue glit that they are ſurcharged withal, hauing ſom what touch<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the Chapter of the Gowt) the greateſt miſhap that may be, is when hawkes fall to laying egges, and to be with egge in the mew. For in very déed this is a great miſchiefe, and diuers times doth kill the Hawke,</p>
               <p>You ſhall firſt perceiue it by the creaking and crying that they vſe in the mew ſomtimes, and other whiles on the perth, albeit now and then they dee it for eagerneſſe and appetite, when they are ſharpe ſet: which as it is eaſily found, ſo is it as quickly remedied.</p>
               <p>A man ſhall know when they fall to liking and laying, by this, from the necke of the hawke down to the very middle of
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:28166:140"/>
her traine, there is vpon the feather a certaine thing like the floure of branne of a pale and aſhie colour.</p>
               <p>And becauſe this accident hapneth by meane of too much daintineſſe and luſtfull pride of the Hawke, it ſhall bee good to kéepe her low, and to hold a hard hand ouer her, pinching her of her féeding, giuing her liquid and moiſt fleſh from the midle of Aprill to the end of May, which is the onely tune to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of all the yeare for this matter. When the hawk doth leaue her croaking and crying in the mew, it is a manifeſt proofe that ſhée is with Egge, which you ſhall know both by her groſenes and ſilling in the panell, as alſo by her idle ſtanding without liſt to féede. And it hahpily the egges bée growne any thing great within her, you ſhall hardly hinder her but that ſhée wil lay them. Therefore (as I tell yon) it ſhall bée good in time to looke vnto it, kéeping her low in Aprill and May. And in thoſe monethes to miniſter vnto her Aloes Epatick waſht, a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Saffron lapped in bumbaſt or cotton, whereupon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey a little Flaxe or Towe, and make a caſting or ſcowring of it, thruſting it downe her throat into her gorge, the hawke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both empty paneld, and hauing no meate aboue to put ouer kooping her on the fiſt after it, till ſuch time the ſcowring be in her gorge. Of this and ſuch like ſcowrings may you giue your hawke euery third or fourth day for foure or fiue times, féeding her with liquid meates, ſuch as will lightly be endewed. And vſing this order, no doubt your hawke ſhall doe well.</p>
               <p>Againe, it is very good againſt the ſame miſchiefe, to cauſe your Hawke in foure or fiue bits of meat, to take a quantity of Saffron in Chiues, vſing her after the manner and forme aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, it is a very good way to delay and kill the liſt and liking of a ſparowhawke to féede her for thrée, foure, or more dayes if you thinke good with liquid meates waſht in water, wherein the great pylles of <hi>Ornus</hi> haue béene infuſed for the ſpace of eight or ten dayes béeing finely cut to péeces. But it ſhould be far better if you cauſe thoſe rinds &amp; pilles to be boiled in water, ſo long vntill they become ſoft and tender, and then
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:28166:140"/>
to waſh your hawkes meat therein.</p>
               <p>If your Hawke be with Egge (as they tearme it) ſo as you may perceiue and féele the egs within her, beſides thoſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid remedies, it ſhall bée good to annoint her tuell with oyle oliue: which being done, conuey in thy forefinger at her tuell, as finely as thou canſt, to féele the egs, which if thou once féele gripe thy hawkes pannel ſoftly for hurting her, forcing down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the eg towards thy finger in her tuell, &amp; if it be poſſible ſo bring it away cleane, &amp; rid thy hawke of it: but if thou canſt not doe it, breake it euen there right, and afterward beſtow a gliſter vpon thy hawke of things lenitiue, to make her mewt and ſliſe well: for by this meane (as my Italian Author doth informe me) thou ſhalt diſcharge thy hawke of this miſchiefe, and bring her to be in perfect ſtate againe.</p>

               <p>To helpe in this caſe thoſe kirnels or ſmall nuttes, which are growing vnder the throat of a weather, are very good (as mine author affirmeth) vſing them euery third day for thrice, or thereabouts, allowing a Sparowhawke three or foure of them at once, being both empty gorged and panneld. But you may giue a Falcon ſixe or more at one time, holding the hawk on the fiſt, till ſhee beginne to ſliſe and mewte, and after that a ſpace feede her with good hote meat, alwayes remembring that if the hawke do loath the taking of them, (as happily ſhe wil) or doe not very well brooke them after thee hath taken them, then that you giue her reſpite betwixt times for thrée or foure dayes together, to the end ſhee may not finde her ſelfe cloyed with them.</p>
               <p>If at the end of eight dayes ſhée beginne to caſt any feather, then may you into the mew with her without more a doe: but if not, then muſt you fall to giuing her of thoſe glandulous kir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels of the weather againe, once or twice more: for vſing it in this order the ſecond time without queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, within ſix or ſeuen dayes, ſhée will caſt the backe feathers, or her ſarcels or flags: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt you throw hir into the mew, giuing hir water to bath for ſhée will very much couet the water, and you ſhall ſée her within two oor thrée dayes ſo bare, and in a maner cleane with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feathers, as ſhée will not bée able for lacke of them to flée to her ordinary ſtand or pearch.

               <head>Of Accidents that happen and light vppon a hawkes feathers, and firſt how to vſe the matter when a feather cannot bee ymped.</head>
               <p>DIuers and ſundry times it ſo fals out that a Hawkes feather being drawn out of the wing or traine by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and force, the hole cloſes vp, and ſhuts after it preſently, in ſuch ſorte as a new feather can by no meanes grow and ſpring vppe in the place to ſerue the hawkes turne and vſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</p>
               <p>For remedie hereof, ſome doe will a man to make the hole againe where it was before, and to open it a freſh with a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley graine, dryed ſo as it bée not burnt. Then after that, to kéepe it open that it runne not together againe, you muſt frame a ſmall Pellette of Larde, or boyled Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, which béeing conueyed into the hole, will there abide, vntill ſuch time as the ſhooting out of the new feather doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue it and diſplace it.</p>
               <p>Some other time it hapneth a feather to bée broken in the quill ſo néere the wing, as it is not poſſible to ympe it againe:
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:28166:142"/>
then doe they vſe, (to make the quill to fall and droppe away without paine to the hawke) this deuiſe. They annoynt the place with the bloud of a young Rat, which will cauſe the broken quill to come away. After which, to kéep the hole open they vſe the helpe aforeſaid with the barly corne.</p>
               <p>Theſe two cures I neuer tryed, becauſe it was neuer my happe (I thanke fortune) to ſtand néedfull of the practiſe. But truely I like neither of them ſo well, as I can greatly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them.</p>
               <p>Otherwiſe it chanceth through the hurt of a Hawkes wing, that one or two of her Flagges, long feathers, or Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celles are bruiſed, and thereby both put her to great paines, and eake hinder her fléeing. Wherefore it ſhall bée in this caſe very neceſſary, as ſoone as it hapneth to looke and view the wing well, whether there be any bloud much or little in the quill that is bruiſed in manner aforeſaid: which if it be ſo, it ſhal be needfull to pierce it with a ſharpe néedle, or ſuch like inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to giue the bloud iſſue before ſuch time as it bée congea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and waxen hard. And after that to annoint the bruiſe, (and eſpecially where the blacke bloud is) witholde larde and reſty Bacon.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, it ſhall be very good to ceaſe the paine, to poure vpon the hurt place thrée or foure droppes of good Oyle of ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſomewhat hote, which hauing vſed for the ſpace of three or foure dayes, it ſhall not be amiſſe to bath it with <hi>Aqua vita</hi> to drie and reſolue it. If you vſe this meane in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning when the hurt is firſt taken, no doubt it will bréede re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution.</p>
               <p>But if by negligence or otherwiſe it be foreſlacked at firſt, ſo as the bruiſed Sarcell or other feather grow out of order, and croſſe the next feather to it in fléeing, and by that meane bée a hinderance to the Hawke, and a paine, it ſhall be good to cut it off in the quill. And to the end there may grow an other ſecond feather in the place of that which is ſo ſpoyled and cutte off, it ſhall bée well done to make the quill to drop
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:28166:142"/>
away. To bring that to paſſe, firſt of all wipe well the bloud congcaled and corrupted within the place, and after that, fill it with <hi>Aqua vita,</hi> of the beſt that may bée gotten, and deale ſo artificially as the <hi>Aqua vita</hi> may ſtay, and not droppeout of the place. Which muſt be done by ſtopping the hole with wax, or ſuch like deuiſe. This <hi>Aqua vita</hi> by meane of the heat of it, will cauſe the quill to fall away within eight dayes or little more, by meane whereof there may ſhoot out a new feather.</p>

               <head>How to ympe the traine of a Hawke beeing all broken, and neuer a feather whole or ſound.</head>
               <p>MAny times it ſo fortunes, as the traine of a hawke is quite ſpoyled, and no one feather left to ſerue the turne. Wherefore it ſhall be neceſſary in this caſe, to ſet your hawk a new traine which is done after this manner.</p>
               <p>You muſt take a pée of paper as bigge as your hand, in the middle wherof you muſt ſlit a hole, through which conuey the hawkes traine being broken, vp to the very rumpe of her, drawing backe through the ſayd ſlit of the paper, all the brailes and ſmall feathers of the traine that grow about the hawkes tewell, both aboue and beneath, ſo as there appeare none at all but the long feathers, vpon which you meane to work your feat. Then cut off thoſe long traine feathers with a fine pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knife, beginning from the firſt, ſecond, third, fourth, fift, and ſo on the other ſide of the traine in like manner, and you muſt cut them off a ſlope, ſidewayes towards the top of the trunke or quil, vntil you come to the two couert feathers, which two you muſt cut directly and not ſloping, as you did the reſt. So as when you haue done, the traine of the hawke may bee in ſhape like the pypes of a payre of Organs. Then take the trayne of a mewed Iay (if it be poſſible, becauſe they are the fayreſt frathers being mewed) ſetting in euery quill of the hawkes traine, one feather of the Iay orderly, the firſt feather of the Iay, in the firſt quill of the Sparowhawke, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently. And if the Iayes feather will not enter the hawks quill, then muſt you cut it a little, and bruſing it with your finger, force it into the cut quill, annointing the end of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed feather in the fat of a figge, the yolke of an egge, or ſuch like ſtuffe, and ſo placing it right and directly with the hawks feather. Hauing ſet one feather in this order aforeſaid, on the one ſide of the hawkes traine, paſſe ouer to the other firſt fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the other ſide, and doe in like maner, alwayes placing and ymping them ſo, as in length, and each condition elſe, they
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:28166:144"/>
may agrée fully with the naturall feather of the hawke: and ſo from one to the other, vntill you come to the two couert feathers, which you muſt ſet laſt of all the reſt, and thoſe in ſo good order, as your eye may iudge them to bee excellently ym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by the iuſt length and ſize of them. After all this, take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way your paper, and with a knife wette in a little ſpittle, goe ouer all the ymped feathers, putting the knife betwixt euery quill, cloſe by the rumpe of your hawke, and ſo go along the feather to cutte away all ſuch ſmall feathers, as ſhall bée out of order, by meane of the ymping and cutting off the feather in the trayne of your hawke. Which done feather by feather, ſet your hawke firſt on your fiſt, and ſo after a ſpace on the perch, that ſhe may tricke her ſelfe, and right and enoyle her feathers with her beake.</p>
               <p>Here will I not omitte to remember euery good Falconer, that hée haue in his houſe, and in a readineſſe about him at al times, his ymping néedles, and ſuch like neceſſary imple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to ſerue the turne withall, and to lend his companions if they néed. For it ſhall redound to his credite greatly, and by meanes thereof hée ſhall be accounted a gallant Gentleman, and a good fellow.</p>
               <p>Now in mine own opinion, I haue diſcourſed ſufficiently of all diſeaſes, and made you priuy to the Italians order of phyſicking his hawke, which I can very well commend, as greatly agréeable to reaſon.

               <p>Wherof the firſt aſſigned to this charact <hi>(A)</hi> doth ſerue to cauterize the head of a hawke, becauſe it is round,<note place="margin">A</note> &amp; ſomwhat plaine on the toppe.</p>

               <p>Ouer and beſide all theſe tooles aforeſaid, a Falconer muſt haue his paire of kniues, one ſtreight pointed, the other ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding at the toppe, a ſplatter, his coping yrons, a payre of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers and a Surgeons inſtrument to ſerue his vſe in all diſeaſes of a hawke about her beake and pounces.</p>

               <p>TO kéep Falcons and all maner of birds of prey in health, the chiefe Falconers ſay y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they muſt neuer haue a great gorge giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſpecially of groſſe meats, as Béefe, Porke, and ſuch other that are hard to be put ouer &amp; endewed. Moreouer you muſt beware in any wiſe that yée féed them not with the fleſh of any beaſt that hath lately gone to rutte, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> will kill them, and yée ſhall not perceyue how. I find by experience, that the giuing of great gorges, and the féeding of them with ſuch ſortes of fleſh, (ſpecially cold) doth deſtroy and ſurfeite more hawkes than all other miſchances that can happen to them. And therefore I warne all Falconers to beware how
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:28166:147"/>
they ouergorge their hawkes: and if they bee driuen to féede them with groſſe fleſh for want of better, let it bée well ſoaked in cleane water, and afterward ſufficiently well wroong. It muſt bée done in Summer with cold water, and in Winter with luke warme water, and it muſt not bée wroong too much with the hand: for the maſſineſſe of the fleſh, and the looſeneſſe of the water will cauſe them to put ouer, and to indew the ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and more ſpeedily. And it will cauſe them to haue the larger panels, whereby they ſhall the better ſcowre the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues downward of the glit &amp; groſſe humors. And this is to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of all groſſe fleſh wherewith yée ſhall bée faine ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to féede your hawkes: but not of any other féeding that is light and of good digeſtion. For yée muſt haue diſcretion to reward your hawke now and then with ſome good line and warme meat, or elſe ſhée may bée brought too low. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the ſeruing of your hawkes with waſht meat (as is ſayd before) is the way to kéepe them in health.</p>

               <p>IF you mind to kéepe your hawkes in time and ſtate to flée well, you muſt make them bath oftentimes, and you muſt ſet water by them, though they liſt not to bath. For ſomtimes a Hawke is deſirous to howze, and take of the water by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſome chance, or for ſome heat of her body, or of her Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer: and then is water good and auaileable to ſet her againe in good plight and health: which thing you ſhal lightly perceiue by that that the Hawke will make countenance of more cheare and reioyce more.

And therefore when the Falconer perceiueth the time to be dangerous for his hawke to take ſuch manner of colde, as in winter time after her flight, or by taking wet in flying: hée muſt firſt weather her well at the ſire, or in the Sunne, &amp; then giue her fiue Cloues of Maces in her caſting, &amp; that will heate her againe.</p>

               <head>How men ſhould make their Hawkes to tyre every day.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> Say further, that the good Falconers and ſuch as haue a care to vſe their Hawkes well, and to kéepe them in health, muſt make them to tire towards the euenings before they let them iouke. When your hawke hath put ouer and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, afterward in giuing her caſting, you may well at your diſcretion giue her (if you liſt) a little Aloes Cicotrine in her caſting, or elſe ſome common pyll, &amp; that doth greatly ſcowre the head, and do her much good. And that muſt bée done eyther once a wéeke, or twice in thrée wéekes: and the ſaid medicine is giuen diuers times by ſuch as like not to giue their Hawks tiring. Neuertheleſſe I ſay that tyring in the morning after the Hawke hath caſt, is very good: And if the tyring bée of plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, kéepe her from eating of feathers (as well as you may) for feare leaſt ſhee take caſting before the euening: for to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards night it is no danger, for then of common courſe ſhée is to haue caſting. Let her tyre againſt the Sunne, ſnyting and ſewing her beake a little at your diſcretion, after as you find your Hawke low and poore, vntill you intend to goe to your paſtime. I haue knowne many Falconers that neuer make their hawkes to tyre, ſaying, that it is but a cuſtom, and néedleſſe: but I ſay the contrary. For inaſmuch as the Hawke is exerciſed by reaſonable tyring, ſhée becommeth the healthier and the lighter both of body and of head, by all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate exerciſes, yea, and ſhée is the better in ſtate alſo as you may perceyue. And I belieue that the opinion of ſuch as ſay ſo, procéedeth of nothing but of ſloth and of ſmall loue which they haue to their hawkes. Therfore forget not to make your Hawke to tyre againſt the Sunne in the morning: for it rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them the better of the watry humors that deſcend out of
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:28166:150"/>
their heads, if eyther before the doing of it, or after, you ſet the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpon a pearch againſt the Sunne, that they may tricke and enoyle themſelues at their pleaſure. This done, yée may ſet them in their accuſtomed places. And becauſe ſome Falconers are ſo ſlothfull (as is ſaid afore) that they will not make their Hawkes to tire, and otherſom haue not leyſure alwayes to do it: in ſtead of tyring, I will giue them a remedy that followeth to eaſe them of their watry humors which they haue in their heades for want of tyring. Take Agarike beaten into pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and <hi>Ierapigra</hi> with a little ſaffron, and make a pyll of it as bigge as a beane, and put a third part leſſe of <hi>Ierapigra</hi> than of Agaricke to binde your pouder together. Let that pyll ſo made bée put into hir wrapped in Cotton, towards Euening when ſhée hath endued her gorge &amp; is emptie, making her ſo receyue it thrée or foure dayes together. And you may vſe this medicine from moneth to moneth at your diſcretion: And by the opinion of all Falconers yée may giue this pyll for all vnknowne and hidden diſeaſes for which you know none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remedy.</p>

               <head>Another receit to keepe and maintaine your Hawkes in good health.</head>
               <p>IF you entend to kéepe and maintaine your Falcons and al other Hawkes in health: take <hi>Germander, Pelamountaine,</hi> Baſill, Grimel ſéede, and Broome flowres, of each of them half an ounce: of Iſope, of <hi>Saxifrage</hi> of <hi>Polipodie,</hi> &amp; of Horſemints, of each of them a quarter of an ounce: of Nutmegges, a quarter of an ounce: of Cubebs, Borage, Mu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>my, Moge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort, Sage of the foure kinds of Mirabolans, <hi>Indorum, Kebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum, Beliricorum,</hi> and <hi>Embelicorum,</hi> of each of them halfe an ounce: of Saffron an ounce, and of Aloes Cicotrine the fifth part of an ounce. All theſe things confect to a powder, and
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:28166:150"/>
at euery eight day or at euery twelfth day giue your Hawkes the quantity of a beane of it with their meat. And if they will not take it ſo, put it in a Hennes gutte tied at both ends, or elſe after ſome other means, ſo as yée cauſe them to receiue it downe. And if they caſt vp the fleſh againe by force of the powder, let it no more be giuen them with fleſh, but in the foreſaid maner of the gutte, and let them ſtand emptie one howre after. And according as you ſée your hawke diſpoſed, make her to vſe this medicine, to ſcowre her of the euill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors that are in her body, bred of féeding vpon naughty fleſh, which engendreth ſuch humors, and cauſeth many diſeaſes in hawkes.</p>

               <head>That the diſeaſes which Hawkes haue in their heads, doe commonly come of giuing them too great gorges, and of fowle feeding: the meane to know it.</head>
               <p>THe chiefe Falconers ſay and agrée, that the diſeaſes in hawkes heads doe moſt commonly bréed of giuing them too great gorges, eſpecially of groſſe and ill fleſh. For when a Hawke hath too full a gorge, ſhée cannot well put it ouer and indue it, whereupon it falleth to corrupting and ſtincking in her gorge by lying too long there, and ſpecially, more in a Hawke that is low and poore, than in one that is high and full of fleſh: inſomuch that ſhée is forced to caſt it all ſtincking. And if ſhee happen to put it ouer ſo ſtinking, it attainteth and rotteth her panel, by meanes whereof the fume and ſtinch aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend vp to her head, and there cloſe and ſtuffe vp her eares, and the paſſages of her pipes and head, ſo as the humors which were wont, cannot paſſe away as they were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed, by reaſon whereof the heade ſwelleth inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately.
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:28166:151"/>
For the humor ſéeketh iſſue, and vent eyther at the eares, or at the nares, or at the throat: for want whereof the Hawke falles in danger of death if ſhée haue not ſpéedy reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. And to diſcerne the diſeaſe of the head, the Hawke will ſniffe often, and ſhut her eyes towards night, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſhut eft the one, and eft the other eye, and make as though ſhée iouked with worſe cheare than ſhée was wont to doe: and then muſt you beware that ſhée ſwell not betwéen the eye and the beake. And if ſhée doe, then cauterize her in that maner that is ſet down hereafter. Whenſoeuer the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor makes a ſhew to ſew out at the Hawkes eares, at her nares, or at her throat, then is ſhée in perill of death, if ſhée bée not holpen preſently.</p>

               <head>The remedy of the ſaid diſeaſe.</head>
               <p>YOu muſt take the larde of bacon that is not reſtie, nor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer old, and of the fatteſt of it make ſlices, as it were to larde Partridges, and ſuch ſmall birdes, and let them ſtéep in freſh cold water a whole night, changing the Water three or foure times. Then take the marrow of béefe well picked, and ſugar once boyled and clarified, and of thoſe thrée thinges being ech of like quantity, with the quantity of a little Beane of Saffron in powder well mingled together, make pylls of the bigneſſe of a beane, and giue them to your hawke, cauſing ſome body to caſt her, and opening her beake by force, if ſhee will not take them otherwiſe. This done, ſet her by the fire, or in the Sunne, and anone yée ſhall ſee how ſhée will ſcowre and ſliſe by caſting vpward and downeward the groſſe hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors wherwith her body is ouercharged. And when ſhe hath muted well thrée or foure times, let her be taken from the fire or out of the Sunne, and ſet vpon her pearch in her accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med place, and let her not be fedde till two howres after, and then allow her of a chicken or mutton but halfe a gorge. Let

               <p>When the three dayes are paſt wherein you haue ſo ſcow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her, take a little pepper beaten into very fine powder and mingling it with Vineger in a Sawcer, open her beake, and rubbe the roofe of her chap therewith, and likewiſe put a droppe or twaine of it into her nares, and ſet her by the fire or in the Sunne, and you ſhall ſée how mightily it will open her head. Howbeit you muſt not giue this medicine to a Hawke that is very poore, for ſhée will not bée able to brooke it. And within an howre or two after feede her with a chickens legge: and after let her haue twice a day at her howres a reaſonable gorge, and let the ſaide powder be giuen her no more but once.</p>
               <p>In ſtead of this powder ſome giue this medicine following which you may giue alſo if you thinke good: that is to wit, a little Staueſacre, howbeit that is very ſtrong, if there hée not ſkill vſed to delay the ſtrength of it. Wherefore if you mind to giue your hawke of it, giue her not paſt thrée or foure graines of it wrapt in a cloath or in linte, which you muſt breake afterward, and beat into powder. Then take a little cleane water in a diſh, and put your powder in it, and mingling it together in maner of a Sirop, put thrée or foure droppes of it into your hawkes nares, and ſet her in the Sun or by the fire as is ſaid afore, if it be cold.</p>
               <p>That done, then by <hi>Martines</hi> aduiſe, take pitch if you will to the mountenance of a beane which you muſt warme be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt your handes, and afterward cleaue it to the roofe of her Beake, rubbing it ouer with a little of the powder of Staueſacre and Pepper till ſhée féele the pitch well vppon her Palate: and by and by in labouring to ſhake off the ſayd pitch and water from her Palate, ſhée will caſt: and let her caſt her fill till ſhée be throughly ſcowred. And when yée

thinke ſhée is ſcowred ſufficiently, take away the ſaid pitch if it it bée not falne off already, and ſet your hawke to the fire, or in the Sunne, as is ſaide in the medicine of the pepper, and féede her with ſome good meat one howre after.</p>
               <p>And to recomfort your hawke after all theſe Medicines, ye may giue her foure or fiue Cloues of Mace as is ſayde afore, after as the bigneſſe of them is, which you muſt firſt brooze a little, and put into her caſting.

<pb n="295" facs="tcp:28166:152"/>
the Canker. All theſe diſeaſes are very dangerous, and put hawkes in great hazard, if there bée not ſkill to remedy them betimes. And Maſter <hi>Amé Caſſian</hi> ſaith, that ſuch diſeaſes bréede of flegme which is in the bodies of Hawkes, as I ſayde afore of the other Rhewm: and that flegme commeth of ſetting them in moiſt and colde places. Alſo ſometimes it commeth of bringing them home cold and wet out of the fieldes, and of ſetting them downe vpon their pearches with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out drying or warming them at the fire or in the Sunne.</p>
               <p>The remedy of thoſe diſeaſes is firſt and formoſt to cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terize them in manner following. Faſhion a little yron with a round head like a peaze (which is called a button) and make it in manner redde hote in the fire, but yet not ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hote (for yron is very violent if it bée too much heat.) Caute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize her therewith on the toppe of her head, becauſe the griefe and diſeaſe is there grounded. Cauſe your hawke to be well caſt that you may cauterize her at your eaſe and pleaſure, for you muſt beware of burning her too déepe, and therefore that yée may be ſure to do it well, mayle your hawk faſt, and pull off a few of her feathers. As ſoone as you haue done ſo, take another yron with a point as ſharpe as the tooth of a combe, and put it in the fire as afore ſaide, and therewith pierce her nares in the mids. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> two or thrée dayes after take another flat yron of a finger broad, heat likewiſe red hote, and cauterize your hawke againe therewith handſomely as it were betwéene the eye-lidde and the horne of the beake, &amp; do it with the ſharper ſide of the yron: not that the yron ought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>déede to haue any edge, but rather by all reaſon to be blunt. And take good héed that the fire touch neither the ball of her eye nor her nares, and therefore ſée that yée gard her eye with a wet clout to kéepe it from the ſmoak. All ſuch maner of fires muſt bée giuen towards the euening before hawkes are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, when they are empty, for otherwiſe the handling of them would make them caſt their gorges. When all is done as it

And if ſhée can abide the heat well, let her alone ſtill for it doth her much good. After noone féed her with a hens legge or with ſome ſmall birds, or with a Ratte or a Mouſe, which are beſt of all, and then ſet her in a warme placa, and giue her not too great a gorge.

               <head>Of a kind of Pippe that is in a Hawke.</head>
               <p>THe Pip commeth chiefly of cold and moiſtnes of the head: and ſomtimes of féeding your hawke with euil and rotten fleſh without waſhing it, and making it cleane in warme wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the winter, and in cold water in the Summer. Wherof ingendereth ſlimy &amp; groſſe humors in the body, which aſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vp to the head, and ingender the pip on the top of the tong as yée ſée commonly fall out in chickens. And yée may perceiue this diſeaſe by your hawkes often ſniting, and by making a noyſe twice or thrice in her ſniting. Maſter <hi>Amé Caſſian</hi> ſaith, that to remedy this diſeaſe, you muſt caſt your hawke gently, and looke vpon the tip of her tong: and if you find her to haue the pip, yée muſt ſcowre her with a pyll made of <hi>Agarik</hi> and <hi>Iera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pigra,</hi> giuen two or thrée dayes together with her caſting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards night, and that will rid her of the Rhewm in her head, the rather if ſhée bée made to tire againſt the ſunne in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings as is ſaid afore. M. <hi>Malopin</hi> in his booke of the Prince, ſayth, that to cure the pip, yée muſt bind a little cotton vpon a ſticks end, and dipping it in ſwéet roſewater, waſh her tongue well with it: and afterward annoint it thrée or four daies with oyle of Almonds, and oyle oliue, wel waſhed as is before ſaid: and when yée haue done ſo, yée ſhall find the pip all white and ſoft. Then take an awle, and with the point of it lift vp the pip ſoftly, remouing it as women do pip their chickens. Howbeit yée muſt not remoue it till it bée full ripe: for if yee take it too gréene, you ſhall hurt your hawke. And looke that yée wet her tong and palat twice or thrice a day with the foreſaid oyle, till ſhée be throughly cured.</p>

               <p>SOmetimes it hapneth that the palates or roofes of hawks mouthes are ſwollen, and looke whitiſh: which commeth of moyſture and cold wherewith their heads are ſurcharged. And ye may perceiue this diſeaſe by that they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not cloſe their beakes, and by that they look not ſo chearly as they were wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to do, ne can put ouer, or endew their meat but with great pain. To cure your hawke of this diſeaſe, you muſt open her beak, where you ſhal find the roof of her mouth whitiſh and ſwollen. And if you find it not ſo, you muſt ſearch her beake to diſcerne if ſhe haue any other diſeaſe there that lets her to ſhut it: for ſometimes their beakes grow more on the one ſide of the clap than on the other, ſo as they cannot cloſe them. The remedie that M. <hi>Amê Caſſian</hi> giues for this euill, is this: The hawkes that are ſo diſeaſed muſt haue the ſaid pils of Larde, ſugar, and marow of béefe, giuen them euery morning one or two for foure or fiue dayes ſpace together, and about an howre or two after, feed them with ſome poultrie or mutton drawn through the foreſaid oyle. And after thoſe dayes open her beake again, and ſoftly ſcrape of the whiteneſſe: and if yee find the ſwelling abated, then do none other thing to her but only continue your anointing of her with the ſaid oile. But if ye perceiue the ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to riſe too hie, ye may launce or pricke it, but yée muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware that yée ſtrike not too déepe, for ye may ſoone kill your hawke.

               <p>THe chiefe Falconers ſay, that the falling ſicknes hapneth to hawkes through a fuming heat that aſcendeth vp frour the liuer to their heads, and maketh them to fall down vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſodaine. M. <hi>Mallopin</hi> ſayth, that to remedy this diſeaſe, the hinder part of their head muſt be peruſed and ſought, where a man ſhall find two litle pits which muſt be cauterized with a wyer of braſſe. And if that help not, then muſt you cauterize her daintily vpon the head w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the foreſaid round yron, or elſe you may hap to kill her. This done, drie red Lentils in an oue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and make them into fine powder: then take the filing of yron the fineſt of it, as much of the one as of the other, &amp; mingle the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both together with hony, &amp; make it in little bals of the bigneſſe of a peaſe.

               <p>M. <hi>Amê Caſſian</hi> teacheth another medicin: that is to witte, that the ſkin of their heads muſt be launced right ouer againſt the foreſaid pits, where there are little veynes which muſt be taken vp with a ſilke thréed, and annointed ouer with the bloud of a chicken. Which being done, yée muſt giue her the foreſaid pils ſeuen or eight dayes together, taking good heed that yée ſet her not neare any other hawkes, and that your hawking gloue bée very cleane.

<pb n="312" facs="tcp:28166:161"/>
bowels (as I ſaid heretofore in the diſeaſes of the head) becaus y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> filth which they haue gathered in their panels inflameth their liuer, which doth ſo drie vp the ſubſtance of the guts, that they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not mute, but muſt néeds die of it if they be not cured. Som ſay that this diſeaſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth of giuing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> waſht meat hote be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be throughly cold, &amp; that is like inough, for a hawk likes not of water &amp; bloud both together at once. The ſtone in the fundament co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth of the filth which the hawke ſhould mute, which thickneth and lies bakte at the tuel: by means whereof ſhe becomes ſo poor that ſhe cannot mute or ſtiſe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her, and ſo muſt néeds die. Yet notwithſtanding I haue ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſeen that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a Falcon is hie &amp; luſty, ſhée wilſtiſe it out wel inough by mean of her ſtrength. And ye may perceiue when ſhée hath the ſtone by that ſhee muteth with paine &amp; by drops, which is a ſigne y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhe néedeth to ſcowre that matter wherof the ſtone doth grow. And when ſhée muteth at twice, &amp; a third time after that, it is a token that the ſtone is throughly confirmed in her guts and panel. Moreouer, when ye ſee that her tuel is chafed, &amp; but litle drops from her, and that the feathers of her train are much fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with her muting, and that ſhe is euermore picking with her beak about her tuel, be ye ſure ſhe hath y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtone in her tuel, which we cal y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtone Cray. Again, when ſhe muteth &amp; maketh as though ſhe would iouke vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your fiſt, &amp; in her cies is more troubled tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ordinary: doubt not but that ſhe hath the ſtone cray. And becauſe ſhe cannot rid it, ſhe is in danger, if ſhe bée not lookt too in time. The remedy therof by the iudgement of M. <hi>Amé Caſſian</hi> is this: take a ſlice of lard (or a pellet of ſope, wet in ſalet oyle) of the bigneſſe of a gooſe quill, and an ynch long, and put thereon the powder of <hi>Aloes Cicotrine:</hi> which done, caſt your hawk hanſomly, &amp; conuey it into her tuell as ye would giue a man a ſuppoſitory, &amp; if the lard be too tender and ſoft to handle, ſticke it vpon a hens feather, ſo as the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appeare not through the Lard, (for ſo may ye do her great harme with the feather,) and ſo conuey it vppe into her tuell drawing away the feather gently, and leauing the Larde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, and haue ſnayles in a readineſſe to giue her immediately
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:28166:161"/>
after yée haue applyed the ſaid deuiſe. And for lacke of ſnayles, giue her the forementioned pyll of lard, mingled with marow and ſugar, and ſet her in the Sun, or by a fire, without féeding of her til one howre after noone. And if thée endure wel to be by the fire, or in the Sun, let her alone, for the heat is very good for her. After this, giue her ſomwhat more than half a gorge of a yong pullet, or if yee can come by any myce or rats, nothing is better. But let her not ſtand in the ayre or in the wind ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the weather be fayre &amp; warm. At night when ſhe hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewed well, giue her foure or fiue cloues of mace broken, and lapped vp in a little cotton, or in the ſkinne of a henne: and do ſo three or four dayes, ſauing the ſuppoſitory or pellet afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, for it will ſerue twice well inough. And thus ſhall you ſkoure your hawk throughly. Looke well to it that ſhée caſt not vp y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cloues of mace, for they be ſingular good for hawks in all reſpects, ſpecially for all humors that ſurcharge their heads and generally for all Filanders and worms. And if you mind to rid a falcon clean out of the cray, and of the ſaid diſeaſe: giue her meat ſteeped in Goats milke, or in other milke, and doe ſo foure or fiue dayes together: for the ſaid milke is very good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the cray. In the booke of the Prince, there is another re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit for this diſeaſe of the cray or ſtone. That is to wit: Take the gall of a pigge of thrée weeks old, and conuey it into your hawkes beake, ſo as ſhée may take it and ſwallow it downe whole without breaking, and take héed that ſhe caſt vp none of it againe. Afterwardes, giue her a little péece of the Pigges fleſh, of the bignes of a Beane, and let her ſtand empty pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neld vpon the ſame vntill night, ſetting her in the Sun, or by the fire. This medicine is very good for all birds of prey that are encombred with the Cray or Stone. Neuertheles, if a Goſhawke or a Sparowhawke haue that diſeaſe (ſo it bée not too ſore) giue it her no more but once. But as for other hawkes that are of ſtronger mettall, yée may giue it them thrice. And when euening is come, féed your hawke with a pullet or with mutton, or with ſmall birds, and the next morning ſtéepe her meat in Goats milke, or womans milke, féeding her ſo three
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:28166:162"/>
dayes together with ſmall gorges, and ſhe ſhall be ſound. And if you will not or cannot vſe the ſaid receit, yée may take a little oyle Oliue, and ſomewhat leſſe hony, and wette your hawkes meate therewith, for it is good to helpe that diſeaſe. Some put the ſaid things into a Hennes gut lied faſt at both ends, becauſe a hawke wil take it the better: and naturally ſhe likes not oyle with her meat.</p>
               <p>Maſter <hi>Michelin</hi> ſets down another medicin which is this. Take Lard, marow of béefe, Sugar clarified, and once boiled and Saffron in powder, of each a like quantity, prouided that the larde bée firſt ſtéeped in vineger four and twenty howres, and the water ſhifted thrée or foure times, &amp; ſet abroad in the open ayre. Of the which thinges confected together, yee muſt make pyls of the bigneſſe of a beane, whereof you ſhall giue your hawke one or two, ſetting her in the ſun, or by the fire, and féeding her with poultry or with muton, allowing her but reaſonable gorges four or fiue dayes together, and giuing her maces as afore: for they cannot but do the hawke great pleaſure in euery condition and part. Maſter <hi>Michelin</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth another receit for this diſeaſe, ſpecially for Goſhawkes, and Sparowhawkes which I haue tryed oft.</p>
               <p>Cut a ſhéepes heart in ſmall péeces, and when yée haue let it lie ſtéeping all night in aſſes milke, goats milke, or womans milke, put a little boyld Sugar into the milke, and gorge your hawke reaſonably therewith three dayes together. And aſſure your ſelfe that this medicise is very excellent for the Cray, &amp; without danger for all maner of hawks. M. <hi>Martin</hi> ſaith in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouchment of this matter, that when a hawke cannot well mute with her eaſe, it betokeneth and plainly ſheweth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhee hath the ſtone Cray. For remedy whereof, take the heart of a hogge, &amp; a quantity of his ſewet minced very ſmall, &amp; make them into powder together, &amp; giue it the hawke in her meate thrée dayes ſucceſſiuely. Againe, I haue ſéene ſome take the whit of an egge, or the whole egge, with a little ſaffron in pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der well coyled and beate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> together, which being beſtowed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the hawkes meat, hath cured her.</p>

Which done, ſet her in the ſun, or by the fire, and féede her not till noone, at which time giue her but halfe a gorge of hote meat, becauſe of the medicine which hath ſet all her body out of temper. Let this be done two or thrée dayes, and if you find the medicine to haue ſcowred &amp; taken much at the firſt of your hawke, giue her leſſe &amp; leſſe, and ſo ſhall ſhe recouer. The booke of Princes ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth downe yet one other remedy for the ſame diſeaſe, that yée might put it in vre which ſoeuer liked you beſt. Take a peny weight of Perſly ſéed, as much of Smallage ſéede, a dramme of boyld ſugar, a peny weight of Staueſaker, of wheaten bran one dram, and halfe the ſhell of an egge. Put them altogether into a good large poſnet full of water, &amp; ſéeth it till it be conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to the one half, &amp; then ſtrain it through a cloth.

horſe is without the Bottes. There are foure kinds of Filan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and one other kind of Filanders, of which I will ſpeake hereafter in their due places. And with all theſe ſorts of Filan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, ſome hawks are more peſtered than other ſome. The cauſe of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is either their féeding on groſſe &amp; foul meats, which ingender &amp; increaſe thoſe filanders in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or els for that in fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eyther y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> field or the riuer, they breake ſome ſmall veines within their bodies, at the encounter, by ſeazing too violentlie vpon their prey. By reaſon wherof the bloud burſteth out into their bowels, &amp; there drieth and clottereth, whereof bréede the ſaid Filanders in great aboundance. Afterward by reaſon of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtinch of the ſaid bloud ſo clottered and bakte, béeing corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted &amp; putrified in the bulke, becauſe it is out of the proper veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels &amp; vains where it ought to be, the Filanders run about ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the cleaneſt places of the body to ſhun the ſaid noyſome ſtinch, and créepe vp eyther into the hawks heart, or into her gorge, ſo as ſhée dyeth of it. Again, ſome men ſay, that theyr hawkes die of the diſeaſes of the head, or of the Cray, when in déed they die of the Filanders, or (which is worſe) of the (<hi>Aig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nilles</hi>) a kind of Filanders, for which wee want an Engliſh terme. I will ſpeake firſt of thoſe Filanders that craule vp to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hawkes gorges, and from thence to the holes in their palates, whereat the hawkes doe breath, and by them into their brains whereby they be in danger of death. Ye may perceiue this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience in the gorge by this, that when you haue fed your hawke, the Filanders féeling the ſwéetneſſe &amp; taſte of the fleſh, do ſtirre and craule about in ſuch wiſe, as you ſhall ſée your hawk oftentimes gape. By reaſon wherof it commeth to paſſe that now and then ſhe caſteth her gorge. Again, yée may know by this, that your hawke will bee ſtrayning at them with her talons. Therfore caſt her gently, and looke into her throat, and you ſhall ſée them crawling there. To kill the ſaid Filanders, M. <hi>Amè Caſſian</hi> ſayth thus: take a great Radiſh roote, and make a hole in it, and fill it with water, &amp; ſet it in embers ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie hote, putting freſh embers to it continually by the ſpace of halfe an howre or more, til it be throughly well boyled, and as
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:28166:163"/>
your water diminiſheth, fill it alwayes vp againe, howbeit that the raddiſh yéeldeth water inough of his owne nature. Than put the raddiſh into a diſh, ſtampe it and preſſe out al the iuyce quite and cleane. This done, put the quantitie of a Peaſe of ſaffron made into powder into the ſaide water, and waſh your hawkes meat therewith when yée féede her, and giue her but halfe a gorge. And if ſhée will not féed on it, let her be kept empty till ſhée bée very gréedy and eager: doe thus to her thrée or foure dayes together, and you ſhall kill the Filan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and make your hawk ſound.

               <head>Of a Hawke that hath her Liver inflamed.</head>
               <p>THe inflamation of the Liuer hapneth ſometimes through the negligence of ſuch as haue the kéeping of hawks. For they féede them with groſſe and naughty fleſh, ſuch as is ſtate and ſtinking, without making of it cleane, by means wherof procéedeth the ſaid inflammation of the Liuer. Alſo it hapneth for want of bathing when néede is, &amp; for lacke of water, which they ought to haue, or with ouerfléeing of them, when they be empty paneld. Ye ſhall perceiue this diſeaſe by their féete: for they will be chaſed, and the colour of their chaps will bée changed, and looke whitiſh through the heate of their Liuer. And if yée find her tongue ſcorched and ſcalded blacke, it is a ſigne of death. To remedy this miſchiefe, make the medicin of ſnailes ſtéeped in Aſſes milk, or Goats milk, mentioned in the chapters of the diſeaſes of the head, &amp; of the ſtone: and giue your hawks of it thrée or foure dayes in the mornings. And if yée cannot get that medicin, ye may vſe the other that is made oflard, marow of béef, &amp; of boyled Sugar, with a little Saf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fron, four or fiue dayes together euery morning, as is ſayd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. For the ſcowring of her will rid and abate her heat. And all that while for ſeuen or eight dayes féed her with poultrie, or with mutton ſtéeped in milke: for milke is very good for the heat of the Liuer. And you muſt beware you féed her not with
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:28166:166"/>
Pigeon, nor with other groſſe fleſh for bréeding her to inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate heat. M. <hi>Amè Caſſian</hi> ſayth yet further, that to allay the ſaid heat in hawkes, it is very good to ſtéepe or wet their meat in Endiue or Nightſhade water: and likewiſe in white whey newly and lately made. And that this maner of féeding muſt be continued foure or fiue dayes till the Hawke bee wel ſcoured. And that if the hawke haue a deſire to bouze the ſaid whey, ye muſt let her take her fill. Maſter <hi>Amé Caſſian</hi> ſaith moreouer, that when your medicine hath ſcowred your hawk after that maner, &amp; her tong is not aught in the better tune, ye muſt take oyle oliue waſht in two or thrée waters, and bath her tong &amp; throat therewith with a feather thrée or four times in the day, for four or fiue dayes together, &amp; gently ſcrape her tong and throat with a deuiſe of ſiluer or of other mettell for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> purpoſe. And although ſhe nether ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> féed nor will, yet ſhe muſt not be giuen ouer, but haue meate gently conueied into her gorge by ſmall morſels and thruſt down low inough with a fine ſticke that ſhe may take it: for ſhe cannot ſwallow her meat by reaſon of the ſwelling of her tong, &amp; therfore ſhe muſt be aſſiſted in maner aforeſaid. M. <hi>Michelin</hi> ſaith furthermore that to comfort and ſtrengthen the liuer withall, ye muſt ſtéep Rubarb in a diſhfull of cold water all night, and the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning waſh her meat therewith, continuing ſo by the ſpace of foure or fiue dayes together.</p>

And the next morning take the ſéedes of ruſhes and the ſcrapinges of Iuorie, and the dung of Sparows, of ech two peny weight and make thereof a powder, and ſeaſon your hawkes meate therewith, and it will pleaſure her.

               <p>IT hapneth ſometimes that when a hawke hath béene reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered of ſome great griefe by good kéeping and intendance, afterward ſhée waxeth euill againe, and falleth to panting, wherof bréedeth this diſeaſe of the reines and kidneis, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of a canker, as big as a bean, which ſwelleth bigger &amp; big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, in ſuch wiſe that ſhée falleth to caſting ſome part of her meat. This Pantas differeth much from both the other: for it will leaue her ſeuen or eight dayes, &amp; then vexe her again more ſtrongly. And ſomtimes it will take her but from Moneth to Moneth, ſo as ſhe ſhall beare it out a whole yeare. It is diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by this, that when ſhe panteth, ſhe ſtirreth her reins more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her pineons, wheras in the other ſhe ſtirreth more her pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions than her reines. Againe, to know it truly when it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth and goeth euery ſeuen or eight dayes, if your Hawke chance to die, rippe her and you ſhall find a knubbe of the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of a ſmall beane full vpon the reynes and the ſmall of her backe whereof that diſeaſe procéedeth.</p>
               <p>Maſter <hi>Caſsian</hi> giueth this remedie for it. Yée muſt take the roots of Capers, of Fenel, of Smallage, and of Parſley and boyle them together in a new potte, to the conſumprion
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:28166:168"/>
of a third part. Then take an olde Tyle, the older the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and make powder thereof. When you ſerue your hawke, féede her with fleſh ſtéeped in the water of the ſaide rootes, a quarter of an howre, or therabouts afore ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. In the morning when yée giue her of that waſht meat, giue her none of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and at night waſh not her meat with the ſayde Water, but beſprinckle it with the powder, ſo competently as ſhe may receiue it, and giue her not at any time aboue halfe a gorge: let this be done nine or ten dayes or more. If ye ſée that your Hawke amend not, continue it ſtill: for then was the diſeaſe very much confirmed, and the hawke had borne it out long, &amp; it is hard to be cured. But if yée take the diſeaſe when it is new and gréene, plie her diligently with this Medicine, and it will helpe her.</p>

               <p>SOmetimes hawkes periſh for want of knowledge of ſome ſecret diſeaſe that hapneth to them, and therfore I will tell you how you ſhall know it. The hawk that hath that diſeaſe is alwayes gréedy to féed, inſomuch that when yée haue giuen her a great gorge in the morning, ſhe will haue indewed it out of hand, and if ye giue her another at noone, ſhe will put it ouer by &amp; by, and if yée giue her the third at night, ſhe will diſpatch that quickly alſo, and the more ſhée féedeth, the more gréedy &amp; nippie ſhe is. This diſeaſe commeth of this, that when your Hawke is very poore &amp; low in ſtate, and you deſirous to ſet her vppe quickly, thinking to bring her in good plight with great gorges, you féed her with Pigeons and other fleſh which ſhée cannot indew by reaſon of her pouerty &amp; weaknes, for want of heat in the liuer: the heat whereof is the cauſe of all kindly digeſtion &amp; indewing. Alſo you may know this diſeaſe by hir often muting which is watriſh &amp; thin, and beſides ſhe doth ſliſe further tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhe is wont to doe by reaſon of ſpéedy induing her meat. M. <hi>Mallopin</hi> in his booke of the Prince ſayth, that for remedy of this diſeaſe ye muſt ſtéepe a ſhéepes heart cutte in ſmall péeces all one night in Aſſes milke, or Goats milke, and the next day giue your hawk a quarter of it in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> morning for her beaching, as much at noon, &amp; the reſt at night, forcing her to receiue as much of the milke as ye can, and continue it fiue or ſix daies together til ye ſée her mute kindly. Then féed her rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably with good meat, ſtéeped in oyle of ſwéet Almonds, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing it for thrée or foure dayes ſpace twice a day. And as ye find your hawke to mend, ſo increaſe her meals by litle and litle, till ſhee be in as good plight as ſhe was before, alwayes
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:28166:169"/>
continuing the ſaid Milke: for ſome are of opinion that milke is good for all diſeaſes of a Hawke. Maſter <hi>Amè Caſſian</hi> ſaith, that to remedy this diſeaſe, yée muſt take a tortois of the land and not a water Tortois, and ſtéepe the fleſh of it in womans milke, Aſſes milke, or Goats milke, and giue your Hawke a quantity of it for a beaching thrée or foure times, and a little more at her féeding times ſixe or ſeuen dayes together.

               <head>Of the Teynt in a hawkes feather, and how many kinds of it there be.</head>
               <p>HItherto yée haue read of the inward diſeaſes of hawks: Now I will tell you of the outward accidents: and firſt will ſpeake of the Teynt which the French Falconers call <hi>Taigne,</hi> the Italians <hi>Zignuole</hi> and <hi>Tarmae,</hi> whereof there are thrée ſorts. The firſt is when their principals or long. Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers begin to droppe off, by meanes whereof many hawkes are marred and caſt away without knowledge how to helpe it. Maſter <hi>Amè Caſſian</hi> ſayeth, that this commeth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of the Liuer, and of the exceſſiue heate of the body, by meanes whereof ſmall pimples riſe vpon their winges, or on their traines, which afterward cauſe their Feathers to droppe-off, and when they are gone, the holes where they ſtood doe cloſe againe, where through the hawke doth periſh, if ſhe bée not remedied. This diſeaſe is contagious, and one of them will take it of another, and therefore yée muſt not let the Hawke that is affected with it ſtand neare a Hawke that is ſound, neyther muſt you touch or féed a ſound Hawke on the Gloue whereon a ſicke Hawke hath béene fédde. And yée ſhall know that ſhe hath that diſeaſe, by her often picking with her beake vpon her principall feathers of her winges and traine and by their dropping away. Therefore caſt your Hawke, and let her be well peruſed, and yée ſhall finde the ſaide diſeaſe. For remedy wherof, Maſter <hi>Martin,</hi> and
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:28166:170"/>
M. <hi>Caſſian</hi> ſay, you muſt caſt your Hawke, and when you haue found the ſmal pimple whence the feather dropt firſt, you muſt get a little ſticke of Firre, which is by nature gummy and fatte, make a little pegge of it, not ſharpe at the forend, nor thruſt it in with violence, but ſoftly as you may. And if ye can get none of that wood, then take a graine of Barley and cutte off the forepoint of it, and annoint it with a little Triacle, or Oyle oliue, and conuey it into the hole, ſo as it may ſticke a little out, and the hole not cloſe together, and ſtoppe againe. Then with a ſmall Launce or Penknife, you muſt ſlitte the pimple, and let out the redde water, which you ſhall find there. After this, take <hi>Aloes Cicotrine</hi> in powder, and put it into the gall of an oxe, coyled in a diſh, and with thoſe two mingled together, annoint the ſlit round about: and beware that there come nothing in the hole where the feather grew, for it might doe the hawke great harme. This done, take of the reddeſt Lentiles that you can come by, and leſſe than halfe ſo much of the filings of yron, and mingle them together with hony, and thereof make Pilles as bigge as a Peaſe, and then giue your Hawke two or thrée of them euery morning. Then ſet her by a fire, or in the Sunne and after noone giue her a reaſonable good gorge of a Pullet, or of mutton, and if ye liſt ye may giue her of thoſe Pilles to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Euening alſo. Let her meat be ſtéeped in milke as is ſaide heretofore fiue or ſixe dayes together, and looke alwayes to the inciſions that yée made, and ſhée ſhall bée re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered.</p>
               <p>An other remedy <hi>Martin</hi> giueth for the ſame diſeaſe. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynt the place with ſome good Balme where the feathers fell away, and the Teint will die out of hand, and freſh fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſupply the place againe. And he ſayth moreouer, that you muſt take the powder of Petre of Alexandria, which is ſold at the Potecaries, and mingle it with Vinegar, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint the diſeaſed place with it three or four times, and it will be whole.</p>
               <p>The ſecond kind of Teynt which fretteth the principalles
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:28166:170"/>
of a Hawke to the very Quill, commeth (as the chiefe Falco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners affirme) of ill kéeping, when they haue not their due in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, being neyther bathed nor ſcowred, nor kept in whole ſome places And therefore we are forbid to kéepe a Hawk in a ſluttiſh corner. Againe, ſometimes both in the mew and out of the mew it hapneth that by féeding them with filthie and loathſome fleſh, they become full of filth both within &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, whereof bréedeth ſuch a ſort of wormes, as doe vtterlie fret aſunder and marre their feathers. The thrée chiefe Falco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſay, that for this ſecond teynt which fretteth the feathers of a hawke in ſort that they becom like ſticks, yée muſt take vine ſhreds, &amp; make thereof as ſtrong Lie as ye can, and waſh your hawke once a day with it throughly: &amp; when ſhe is wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered again, anoint all her feathers w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hony out of the comb. Then make powder of <hi>Sanguis Draconis,</hi> and roch alom very ſmall, and powder the foreſaid Quils therewith, &amp; your hawk ſhall be recured. Or elſe take a Mole of that ſort which bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in medows, &amp; put her in a new earthen pot wel couered, &amp; ſtopped, &amp; ſet it on the fire one whole day: which done, take her out againe as ſhe is, &amp; make her into powder very ſmall. And when ye haue bathed your hawkes feathers throughlie with the ſaid lée, by and by beſtrew her feathers w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Mole a certaine time together, &amp; it wil pleaſure her.</p>
               <p>The third kind of Teynt is knowne in hawkes by the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of their principall feathers throughout alongſt the vpper ſide of the web of them. And that hapneth commonly for want of clean féeding and due attendance. To remedy this, <hi>Mallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin</hi> ſayth, that yée muſt take a gréene réede, and cleane it all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longſt, and ſcrape out the pith of it, and wring out of it as much iuyce as yee can, wherewith you muſt moyſten the ſaid riuen feathers all alongſt the riftes of them, and they will cloſe and ſhut againe as before. And if any feather hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to be dropt away, let a tente made of Firre or of a grayne of Barley as is ſaid heretofore bée put into the hole of it, and vſe it after the foreſaide manner, and a new feather will grow againe out of hand. It this deuiſe, to cauſe a feather
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:28166:171"/>
to grow againe be not to your liking, you ſhall in this collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on find ſuch as may content you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Martin</hi> giueth another medicine and aduice for the ſame, which is this: Take two pennie weight of Orpiment, &amp; nine graines of pepper, and make it into powder, and caſt it vpon her meate which muſt be reaſonable warme. Again, take thrée ſlices of bacon of that which is neareſt the ſkinne, and let them bée ſo ſmall as your hawk may ſwallow them with eaſe: ſawce them with a little hony, and ſtrew of the powder of the filings of yron vpon the hony, and giue your hawk therof thrée daies together. After which time take a young chicken, &amp; before yée boyle it in wine, bruiſe the breaſt of it, and open it with a ſharp knife or other inſtrument that the bloud may follow. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> feed her with the ſaid pullets fleſh warme, ſtéeped in Goats milk, or other milke. Practiſe this two or thrée dayes, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thereupon giue her good warme meat, and ſhée ſhall recouer.</p>

            <div type="section">
               <head>Of the Hawke that indeweth not, ne putteth over as ſhe ſhould doe.</head>
               <p>IT falleth out ſometimes that a Hawke cannot well indew, nor put ouer her meat as ſhe ſhould doe, &amp; that is onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhée is fowle within, or hath taken ſome ſurfet, or elſe that when ſhe was low and poore, her kéeper being deſirous to ſet her vp againe too haſtily, gaue her too great gorges which ſhe by reaſon of her weakenes was not able to put ouer, and indew, where through ſhée ſurfetted and forwent her appetite of féeding altogether. For remedy hereof, <hi>Maliopin</hi> ſaith, yee muſt féed her with light meats, &amp; little at once, as with young rattes and miſe, or with great rattes, for there is more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in them than in the other, whereof yée muſt giue her but halfe gorges, that ſhe may the ſooner indew them, and put them ouer. Or elſe féede her with Chicken, or mutton dipped in Goats milke, or otherwiſe. And for want of thoſe, take the yolke of an egge, &amp; giue her a quarter of a gorge thereof,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:28166:171"/>
and when ye féede her with the fleſh of any liue bird or fowle, ſtéepe it well in the bloud of the ſame fowle, and it will doe her much good. So ſhall your hawke mount of her fleſh apace: if beſides that, you doe alſo ſcoure her with pils made of Larde, marow of beefe, ſugar and ſaffron thrée mornings together, &amp; two howres after giue her a reaſonable gorge.</p>
               <p>Another receit which M. <hi>Michelin</hi> giueth, ſaying. When a Hawk indews not her meat, ne putteth it ouer as ſhe ought to doe, but hath ſurfeited and wanteth naturall heat: Take very pure white wine, and ſtéepe her meat in it luke warm, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing it her by little &amp; litle oft times in the day, alwayes chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging her meat, and ſée that it be light of digeſtion. Do thus to her till ſhée bee in better tune againe, giuing her fiue or ſixe cloues of maces in the euening wrapped in a little cotton, or in ſome other ſuch like deuiſe: for that will warme her head, &amp; all her other parts very well, and let the cotton bee dipped in odoriferous old wine.</p>

               <p>ANother miſchief is wont ſomtimes to light vpon hawks namely, that by taking ouer-great gorges, they can ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indew nor caſt it againe, &amp; alſo that many times a hawke ſoareth away with her prey, and féedeth ſo gréedily vpon it by reaſon ſhée was kept ouer eager and ſharpe, that ſhe can ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther get it vp nor downe, and thereupon falleth in daunger of death. Wherfore all men ought to vſe diſcretion in feeding their hawks, that they ouer-gorge them not.</p>
               <p>M. <hi>Caſſian</hi> ſaith, that for remedy thereof, yée muſt ſet cleane water in a veſſell before your hawke, &amp; let her houze thereof at her plaſure. And if ſhe liſt not: then take the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of a beane of Porke, of the fatteſt of it, and two parts leſſe of powder of Pepper, with a little ſalt brayed very ſmall, and when ye haue mingled them altogether, make a little bal of it

               <p>MAny times it commeth to paſſe that when a hawk hath fed, ſhée cannot kéepe her meat but falleth to caſting, as ſoone as ſhée hath receyued it. This commeth of féeding her with groſſe fowle, &amp; vnholeſome meat not waſhed: or elſe for that ſhe is foule in the panel, and ſo cannot indew by reaſon of the great ſtore of filth that is within her. Therefore yée muſt beware that ye cut not her meat with a foule knife, or w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a knif that hath cut onions, léekes, chibbols, or ſuch other like things. To remedy this inconuenience, giue not your hawke great gorges. And to bring her well in tune again, ſcoure her with the forementioned pilles of larde, marow, ſugar, and ſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fron by the ſpace of thrée dayes. And aboue all things, let not the hawke that hath caſt her gorge be fed a good ſpace after it, but let her ſtand empty in the Sun with water before her to bowſe at her pleaſure, for that will doe her much good. And when yée féede her, giue her at the firſt time but a quarter of a

But if ſhe kéepe not all her meat, giue her yong rats or liue mice: and for want of thoſe, giue her ſmall birds til ſhée bée recouered. If theſe foreſaid things boot not, then by <hi>Mallopins</hi> aduiſe, take Coriander ſeed beaten in powder, and temper it with warme water, ſtraining it through a cloth, waſh your Hawks meate therewith foure or fiue dayes together, and if ye haue no Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riander ſéed, take the iuyce of Coriander.

               <p>For the ſame diſeaſe <hi>Michelus</hi> ſayth, you muſt take com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon pils that are giuen to purge men withall, &amp; giue one or two of them to your hawk in the morning, keeping her hooded by the fire, or in the Sun, looking to hir that ſhe caſt them not, (if it may be) to the intent they may cauſe her to ſcowre down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. And the booke of the Prince ſayth, that it is good giuing of thoſe pilles to hawks in the beginning of September. For if they haue the Filanders, or any other inward diſeaſe, it ſcow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth them, and riddeth them of all miſchiefes that may enſew. Three or foure dayes after you haue giuen your hawke theſe Pils, if ſhe haue yet no luſt to feed, caſt the filing of yron vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her meat three or foure dayes together.</p>
               <p>M. <hi>Amè Caſſian</hi> ſayth, that for the ſame diſeaſe, when yon perceyue it you muſt giue your hawke a liue ſtockedoue, allowing her leaue to ſeaze and tire vpon it, &amp; to take the bloud of it at her pleaſure. And for want of a ſtockdoue, ſmall birdes are good, and ſo be rattes and miſe, ſo ſhe haue them aliue. And if you will haue her to endew them quickly, giue her but halfe gorges.</p>

               <p>IT happeneth ſometimes that Hawks are brought ſo low, that a man ſhall haue much a do to ſet them vp again. And that commeth through the fault of vnſkilfull keepers, rather than any other thing. For ſome giue them ill meat, cold, &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waſhed. Alſo Hawks do happen to grow poore by ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe that their keepers are not ware of. Again, ſometimes it hapneth that a Hawke ſoares away, and is loſt foure or fiue dayes, and ſo becommes poore for want of prey. M. <hi>Caſſian</hi> ſaith, that if ye will ſet her vp again, ye muſt feed her a little at once and with good meat, ſuch as rattes and mice are, for they
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:28166:173"/>
they be light of digeſtion, or elſe with ſmall birds which are good likewiſe, and of great nouriſhment. Poultrie alſo is good but it nouriſheth not ſo much of his owne nature as Mutton doth.</p>
               <p>Againe, yée may ſet her vp (when ſhe is low) in this maner following. Take a ſpoonefull or twaine of hony, thrée or foure of freſh butter, boyle them together in a new pot of water, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> take Porke well waſhed, &amp; ſteepe it in that water, giuing your hawke a good reaſonable gorge of it twice a day, warming your ſaid water when you intend to féede your Hawke. And if yée can find any Snailes that bréed in running waters, giue her of them in the morning, and they will both ſcowre away the groſſe ſlimie humors that are in her panell, and alſo bée a great helpe to ſet her vp againe, (for they nouriſh very well.) And if yée mind to make your hawke eager, and ſharpe ſet, without bating her ſelfe, take the heart and liuer of a Pie, and when ye haue made it into powder, make your hawke to eat it, and it will ſet her ſharpe and eager.

After this you muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply another playſter of <hi>Draculum magnum,</hi> which you ſhall find at the Apotecaries: or it is a great drawer, and if it haue any dead fleſh in it, lay a little Verdegréece to it, for that is a coroſiue and a fretter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Martine</hi> ſayeth, that to ſoften the pinne on the hawks foot and to make it grow to a head, yee muſt take the rootes of Flower deluce which beares the blew leafe, drie it and beate it into powder, and make thereof a ſalue with hony of Roſes, and lay it to the pinne till it be throughly whole.</p>
               <p>Maſter <hi>Caſſian</hi> ſayth further, that if your hawkes féete bée chafed, and fall to ſwelling, take the fyling of yron beaten into powder to the mountenance of a beane or twaine, and the quantity of a beane of a gad of ſtéel fyled into powder, and twice as much of the barke of an oake, as of the fyling of yron, of which barke of the Oke, you muſt take away the vttermoſt part, and of the reſt make fine powder, féered through a cloth. When ye haue mingled all theſe powders together, boyle them in a new pot with a potſle of good vineger, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of a third part. Then let it ſettle, and put the cléereſt of it alone by it ſelfe, and the grounds of it alſo by it ſelfe in a long narrow bagge that the hawke may reſt both her feet vpon it. And with the water yée may vſe to bath, her féete euery day thrée or foure tymes a day. Likewiſe yée muſt wet and refreſh the bagge with the ſame water, that the grounds may lie the cloſer vnder the féet of the hawke, which muſt ſtand vppon it night and day till ſhée bée recured. And truely this is good for all manner of griefes and ſwellinges of the féet.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Martin</hi> is of opinion that yée muſt take halfe an ounce of Aloes and the white of an egge, with halfe an ounce and two penny weighte of Glew, mingle them all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and put them in preſſe, ſo as all may bée reſidence, and make thereof a playſter, and lay it to your Hawkes

And when there hapneth any rupture, take Salte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>péeter and Allom, of each two penny weight, making it into powder, beſtow it vpon the broken place to fret the dead fleſh away, for this is a good coroſiue for that purpoſe.</p>

               <p>The beſt thing that you may doe, when you meane to caſt her into the mew, is firſt to ſcowre her well after that maner that I haue ſhewed you in this booke, to cope her well and to ſet her vp in fleſh before you caſt her into the mew to diſcharge her of all diſeaſe as neare as yon can, to rid her of mites &amp; life being once in the mew, to ſet her water ſometimes, to feed her with liquid and laxatiue meats now and than, and to omitte none of thoſe inſtructions which I haue collected for you out of the Italian Falconers: for they are very good obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

                     </gap>ch,</hi> I finde one neceſſarie note for a Haggart, which is this.</p>
               <p>The Haggart (ſaith he) is not to be caſt looſe into the mew, but to be mewed on the fiſt, for otherwiſe ſhée would become too coy and ſtrange, and if ſhée fall to bating and beating her ſelfe for heat, then muſt you hoode her vp, or beſpowt her with cold water, the next way to make her leaue bating. Thus muſt you continue her on the fiſt till ſhée beginne to ſhed her feathers, then ſhall it be good to ſet her downe, and tie her to a ſtone or perch as you doe the reſt. And after ſhe hath mewed, and comes to flée, then if you let her ſtand on a blocke or billet caſed and rolled with cloth, you ſhall doe very well.</p>
               <p>Goſhawkes, Tiercels and Sparowhawks muſt be mew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as Falcons, ſaue that they will not be borne on the fiſt, but be at liberty in the mew, and very cleanely ſerued.</p>
               <p>Before you draw your hawke out of the mew fiftéene or twenty dayes, you muſt begin to bate her of her diet, the ſooner and better to enſeam her, by reſtraint of her full féeding, which ſhe had before, for otherwiſe there would follow ſurfet and repleation, than which there is no more dangerous euill.</p>
               <p>It is no ſlender part of ſkill ſo to vſe a Hawke in the mew as ſhée may be quit of all miſhaps that befall her in the mewe, if ſhe be not well attended and regarded, during the time ſhe is in the mew.</p>

their owne nature, and ſome by miſhap doe fail to be diſeaſed, or otherwiſe breake their feathers, and caſt them not all the yeare long. As touching this matter, Maſter <hi>Mallopin</hi> in his booke of the Prince ſaith, that when your Hawke meweth not well and kindly, goe in May to a ſlaughter houſe where Sheepe are killed, and take the kernels that are vnder theyr eares right againſt the end of the iaw-bone, of the bigneſſe of an Almond. Chop ten or twelue of thoſe kernels verie ſmall and giue them to your hawke with her meate, finding the meanes by ſome way or other that ſhe may receyue them and put them ouer. And when ſhe once begins to caſt her feathers giue her no more of them.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <head>Another way.</head>
               <p>WHen ye mean to further the mewing of your Hawk, take of the Snailes that haue ſhels, ſtampe them ſhels and all, ſtraining them through a cloth, and with the oyle that comes thereof waſh her meate two or thrée times. Alſo take of the ſnayles that lie in running ſtreames, giue your hawke of them in the morning: for that will both ſcowre her and nouriſh her greatly, and ſetteth her vp, &amp; maketh her to mew apace. Maſter <hi>Michelin</hi> in his booke of the King of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pres, ſaith thus: Cut an Adder in two parts and ſéeth him in water, and with that water and wheate together féede your Pullets, Pigeons, Turtles, and other birds which you intend to allow your hawkes that are ſlacke to mew, and ſoone after they ſhall mew their feathers apace.</p>
               <p>M. <hi>Caſſian</hi> ſaith, that when a Falcon will not mew, yée muſt take of Backs, otherwiſe called Reremice, and drie them ſo at the fire or in an Ouen, as yee may make them into powder which you muſt beſtow vpon your Hawkes meate. Alſo take little ſucking whelpes, and féede your hawke with the fleſh of them ſtéeped in the milke or renet which you ſhall finde in the mawes of them: afterward ſhred the maw it ſelfe
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:28166:181"/>
in ſmall peeces, and force her to take it, and ſhée ſhall mew ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well and timely. Likewiſe all maner of liue birdes make a Hawke to mew well, for it is their naturall féeding, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore beſt for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Martin</hi> ſayeth, that to mew your Hawke well, ye muſt ſet water by her once or twice a weeke, and alſo roſt Frogges in the fire, making them into powder, and beſtowing it vpon her meate. Likewiſe ſmall fiſhes chopped, and giuen with her meate, do further a Hawkes mewing very much.

Alſo you muſt caſt her into the mew high, luſty, and in good plight, well ſcowred, and fed with good hote fleſh.

For now &amp; then they will bowze, by meanes whereof they diſcharge their bodies of humors, and alſo their bathing in it, maketh them the better penned and the firmer.

               <p>WHen ye draw your hawkes out of the mew, yée had neede to take héede that they bée not too greaſie: for ſometimes when they bée ſo, and ſet vpon the fiſt vnhooded, they ſo take on and heate themſelues with bating, that they break their greace within them, putting themſelues in great danger of death. Wherfore my counſel is, that all mew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hawks ſhould be well attended and fed with waſht meat, fourtéene or fiftéene dayes before they bee drawne out of the mew to bréede reſolution of glitte and groſſe matter which is in their panels, whereof they ſhall ſcowre the moſt part by doing as is aforeſaid, and ſo ſhall ye quit them of all danger.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mallopin</hi> ſpeaking hereof in his booke of the Prince, ſaith, that if a hawke bée huge and greaſie, when ſhe is new drawn, a man muſt not beare her vnhooded. For yée may well vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that if ſhée feele the ſunne, the aire, or the wind; ſhe light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly falleth to bating and ſtirring, by meanes whereof ſhée hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth her ſelfe inordinately, and ſo runs in danger of death, &amp; ſpoyle by taking cold vpon it. Whereupon the Petty falco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and Nouices which know not what it meaneth, ſay that the hawke periſheth by meane of her me wing and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough default. And therefore when a Hawke is to be drawne out of the mew, ſhée muſt be well attended and lookt to, that hernie at be waſht, and regard had that ſhée bée not ouergor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. And if happily ſhée looſe her appetite, and liſt to féede, take Aloes Cicotrine, and the iuyce of Barberies, and fores her to receyue it in the gut of a hen.

yée muſt waſh her meat, féeding her therewith by little &amp; little, and allow her ſuch fleſh as is laxatiue, that ſhe may haue the leſſe ioy to kéepe it long or ſtand vpon it, and to the end ſhée bée not proud or ouerhaught of her drawing out of the mew.

               <p>SOmetimes Hawkes are with egge in the mew, and efte withour the mew, whereby they fall ſicke, and are in great daunger if there be not remedy had for it: which thing you ſhall eaſily perceyue by them in May &amp; Aprill, at which times they are wont to be with egge. To remedy this inconuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, let the Hawkes meate bee waſhed in the vrine of a man-child of ſixe or ſeuen yeares old, eight or nine dayes together, and that will kéepe her from laying.

For remedy hereof, take a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Orpiment beaten into very fine powder, and hauing mingled it with halfe as much powder of Pepper, let your Hawke bée caſt handſomly that ſhée breake not her feathers then powder firſt the one wing, and ſo the other gently, and finally, all the whole carkaſſe of her: after which, ſet her vpon your fiſte againe, beſpowt her, and ſquirt a little Water on her with your mouth, and ſet her by a fire, or in the Sunne til ſhe be throughly wethered. Afterward when yée intend to féed her, waſh her beake to take away the ſauor of the Orpiment, and beware that your Hawke be not poore, when you intend to vſe Orpiment. Hauing thus done, you ſhall ſée that al the mites and lice will diſcouer themſelues vpon ker feathers and die, either the Orpiment alone, or the Pepper alone are as good as both of them together, to ſpoyle the mites. But here is the oddes, the Pepper maketh the mites to ſhew themſelues, and then the Orpiment murdreth them.

               <figure/>
               <p>HOw neceſſary a thing a Spaniell is to Falconrie, &amp; for thoſe that vſe that paſtime, keeping hawks for their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and recreation, I déem no man doubteth as wel to ſpring and retriue a fowle being flowen to the marke, as alſo diuers
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:28166:186"/>
other wayes to aſſiſt and ayde Falcons and Goſhawkes. Wherefore, ſéeing that hitherto in my collection I haue ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken altogether of Hawkes both for the riuer and field, and in my conceite haue left few néeefull poynts for a good Falconer vntoucht or treated of: now I ſhall not doe amiſſe, nor wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ouer wide from my purpoſe, if I ſay ſomewhat of Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niels, without the which a Falconer, (ſpecially vſing to flée the field) cannot be without mayme of his paſtime, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payre of his gallant glée. And againe, for that they are ſubiect to many diſeaſes and plagues, (as wée commonly tearme them) for dogges, and longer than they are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out infection wée may expect from them no pleaſure, aſſiſtance or recreation: I will onely in this treatiſe deſcribe you their harmes with cures due to the ſame. Among all which I place the Mangie firſt, as the capitall enemy to the qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et and beauty of a braue Spaniell, wherewith they poore dogges are oftentimes greatly plagued, both to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of their fellowes, and the no ſlender griefe of theyr maſters.</p>
               <p>The way to cure and diſcharge a Spaniell of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, is to annoint him eyther at the fire, or in the Sunne,<note place="margin">The cure for the Mangie.</note>
thrice euery other day with an vnguent made of Barrow, flicke one pound, common oyle thrée ounces, Brimſtone well brayed foure ounces, ſalt well beaten and brooſed, aſhes well ſifted and fierced, of eyther two ounces, boyling al theſe in a Kettle or Potte of Earth, mingling them well toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther till the barrow flicke bée incorporate and well compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the reſt. With this Vnguent thus made and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, annoint and beſmeare all the body of your Spaniell, and euery other part of him, ſhifting his litter and kennell often, the oftner the better. And laſtly, hauing thus done, waſh him ouer and ouer with good ſtrong lye, and it will mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie and kill the Mangie.</p>
               <p>But if perhaps (as commonly it falleth out) the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel looſe her heare, though it procéedeth not of the force of this
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:28166:187"/>
vnguent and ſtrong medicine, yet it ſhal be very good to bathe your Spanell, ſhredding his haire in this order, with the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Lupines, or Hoppes, and to annoynt him with ſtale Barrowes flicke.</p>
               <p>This medicine, ouer and beſides that, it cureth and quitteth the Mangie it alſo maketh the Spanells skin beautifull and fayre to looke to, and killes the flies, the dogs diſquieters and enemies, to his eaſe.</p>
               <p>But when this foreſayd remedy is not of force ſufficient to rydde the Mangie, but that it ſpreddes and getteth greater power and dominion ouer your Spanell: then doth it behooue you to douiſe a farre ſtronger medïcine, which is, to take of ſtrong Vinegar two quarters, or as much as will ſuffice, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Oyle ſix ounces,<note place="margin">Another remedy more ſtrong.</note> Brimſtone thrée ounces, ſut of a chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny or pot, a quantitie of ſix ounces, brayed ſalt and ſerced, two handfulls: boyle all theſe aforeſayd in the Vinegar, vſing the former order of anoynting your Spanell in the Sommertime.</p>
               <p>If neither of theſe remedies aforeſayd will ſerue the turne, then for a laſt refuge, you muſt be driuen to practiſe with a far ſtronger, than eyther of both. But in any wiſe, this medicine muſt not be miniſtred in the cold of winter, for it will then put the Spanell in great hazard of death.</p>

Then waſh him twice with blacke Sope, and obſeruing this order of annoynting him euery other day twice or thrice, aſſuredly you ſhall ryd him of all Mangineſſe, whatſoeuer it be.</p>

               <p>But if it were bitten by a mad dogge, it ſhall bée beſt preſently to thruſt through the ſkin of his head, and pol with a hote yron iuſt betwixt the eares, ſo as the fire may touch both ſides of the hole made: And after that with your hand to placke vp the ſkin of the dogges ſhoulders and flankes back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, thruſting it through with the hote yron in like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p>The giuing of this vent to the wound will greatly pleaſure the Spaniel, and is a ready way to cure him.</p>
               <p>Beſides the application of this cauterie and fire, there is one other approued remedy, and that is, to cauſe your Spaniel to lappe twice or thrice of the broth of Germander, and eate the Germander it ſelfe boyled. I néed not to deſcribe the hearbe it is ſo well knowne: but my Author ſets down his proportion &amp; flowre. It beares a iagged leafe, and hath a purple or blew flowre, and in ſhape it is like a little oke.</p>
               <p>This herbe Germander ſodden and confected with ſalt and oyle,<note place="margin">To helpe a Spaniel that hath loſt his ſenſe of ſmelling.</note> eyther ſimply bruiſed together, or made into a paſte, and giuen vnto a Spaniell, will doe him very much good in the cure of the bite of a mad dog.</p>
               <p>Now and then Spaniels by meane of too much reſt and greaſe, and ſome other accident beſides, doe looſe theyr ſenſe of ſmelling, ſo as they cannot ſpring or retriue a fowle after their accuſtomed maner. In this caſe it ſhall bée very good to ſcowre a Spaniel in this maner.<note place="margin">The Cure.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Take Agaricke two drammes, <hi>Sal gemma</hi> one ſcruple, beate theſe into powder and incorporate them with Oximel, making a pill as bigge as a nut, conuey the pill into butter, and ſo giue it the Spaniell eyther by loue or force, as he may

               <head>To cut off the tip of a Spanels tayle or ſterne.</head>
               <p>IT is very neceſſary to cut off a little of the Spanels tayle, when it is a whelpe for ſundry occaſions: for in ſo doing, you ſhall deliuer him, and be a meane that no kind of worme or other miſchiefe ſhall greatly offend that part of your Spanell: Which, if it be not cut a little at the very point and toppe, is ſubiect to many euils and inconueniences, and will be a cauſe that the dog will not dare to preſſe ouerhaſtily into the couert after his game. Beſides the benefite of it, the Dog becomes more beautifull by cutting the toppe of his ſterne: for then will it buſh out very gallantly, as experience will teach you.</p>
               <p>It ſhall be good when Spanell whelpes are one moneth old or ſomewhat more, to worme them vnder the tong:<note place="margin">To worme a Spanell.</note> for there haue they a ſtring very like to a worme, which muſt be pluckt away by ſome deuiſe or other. This is the order of it: If it be a whelpe of a moneth old, they take him and open his flew and tawes with a mans hand: but if it be a bigger Spanell, then do they conuay a round ſticke into his mouth, to kéepe it wide open: which done, they plucke out the Dogges tong, and with a ſharpe knife of purpoſe for it, they ſlyt the tong all alongſt where the worme lyes, on both ſides, and ſo very artificially with the point of the knife, they rayſe vp the worme the better to pull it away. But in this caſe there muſt be care vſed, that the worme be not cut aſunder, but had cleane away, without leauing any part of it behind.</p>
               <p>Some men do vſe (in the taking away of this worme in a Spanels tong) a néedle or ſuch like inſtrument with a double twiſted thréed hanging to it, two ſhaftments in length, thru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting the néedle quite vnderneath y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worme iuſt in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> middle of it, drawing the néedle ſo farre vntill the double twiſted thréed be leuell with the middle of the worme, then drawing it hard with the hand, they pull it out (but by drawing the threed
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:28166:190"/>
artificially, many times the worme breakes in two péeces, and then it is a verie harde matter to come by that parte that is ſlipt and left behind. Wherefore in mine opinion, the firſt is the better way to diſpatche him cleane. For when this worme is once quite drawne out, the Spanell will become farre the fairer, and waxe the fatter. Many times the want of worming doth kéepe a Spanell poore, and out of fleſh, ſo as he can not proue. And (as ancient writers affirme) the worming doth diſcharge the Spanell of madneſſe and frenſie (which I can hardly credite or beléeue: the infection and biting of an other madde Dogge being ſo venemous, as it is able to worke great effecte in the Dogge that is bitten.)</p>
               <p>Thus much I thought good to write of Spanels, and their diſeaſes and cures, for that they are ſuperintendants, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie ſeruants, both for the Hawke and the Falconer, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whome, the ſport would bee but colde, and the toyle farre more than it is to the man. Wherefore it ſhall not be amiſſe for a good Falconer, alwayes to bréede and kéepe of the beſt kinde of Spanels that he may come by, and ſo to reſpect them, as they heate not at any time: Or if they doe by miſfortune or negly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of your lackey boye; then to regard their cure, which may be done in manner as I haue héere ſet downe: And withall to vſe due correction to the boy. For a good Spanell is a great iewel: and a good Spanell maketh a good Hawke, and a curſt maiſter, a carefull footeman. Farewell. (∵)</p>
