            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A LETTER FROM A Gentleman in the Country TO HIS Friend in the City, &amp;c.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN Obedience to your Command, I have diligently peruſed Sir <hi>William Petty</hi>'s ingenious Treatiſe, Entituled <hi>Verbum Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pienti,</hi> &amp;c. And ſhall offer you my Senſe of it with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Brevity, which the real weight and marvellous variety of Matter admits.</p>
            <p>I cannot enough commend the Learned Author's Scope and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to give us a perfect State of our chiefeſt Publick Concernments, and that at a time, when we ſeemed ſo much to need it: Or, (as in another Caſe he is pleaſed himſelf to term it) <hi>Our Political Anatomy:</hi> Wherein, if any Miſtakes or Omiſſions there ſeem to be, without doubt the Merit of ſo noble an Enterpriſe makes more than double Amends. <hi>In magnis voluiſſe ſat eſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I may likewiſe without Complement to him affirm, it is the firſt conſiderable Eſſay of this nature, which I have ſeen or heard of; and therefore treading in an unbeaten Path, he cannot Err, but very pardonably, ſo as to challenge our Thanks, rather than incur our Cenſure. Nor will it, I hope, be any blemiſh or dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to ſo great a Maſter of Political Meaſures, as Sir <hi>William Petty</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:94192:3"/>
is reputed: If one, who, 'tis like, would never himſelf have thought of a Performance ſo uſeful to the Publick, nor could, to be ſure, had he luckily ſtumbled on it, have acquitted himſelf therein half ſo well, yet ſtanding, as it were, upon his Shoulders, ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend in ſome things to ſee farther now, than he at the time he wrote could do. For indeed we rightly ſay, <hi>Bernardus non videt omnia.</hi> And a known Maxim tells us, <hi>Facile eſt nonnihil inventis addere.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Apology premiſed, I ſhall, with your Patience, take the Treatiſe it ſelf in pieces, and curſorily examine it, Chapter by Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, both to give his important Diſcoveries their due Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and note his ſeeming defects.</p>
            <p>In his ſhort, but Solid Introduction, he gives us a general, yet excellent View of our dangerous (not to ſay monſtrous) Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportions, in point of Taxing: Wiſely withal inſinuating, how light and even infenſible our Burthens equally charged would be, which yet, by many long continued Inequalities, have oft-times proved ſo heavy, ſometimes inſupportable. Whereof I ſhall only ſay, if herein at all he Err, it is ſufficiently on the modeſter and ſafer ſide, in rather palliating, than aggravating our Miſconduct on that behalf.</p>
            <p>In his Firſt Chapter, he preſents us a kind of Particular or Rent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of our Eſtate: Examining, as it were, with <hi>Boccaline,</hi> our real Weight. Therein yielding us a fair Occaſion of Enquiry, how the Parts agree with the Total; and whether he hath left out no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, or nothing very material.</p>
            <p>It is not my buſineſs here to conteſt with him the juſt Values of the ſeveral Branches ſpecified in his Catalogue. Rather I ſhall take his Account thereof <hi>de bene eſſe,</hi> as equally probable with others, which I have met with of the ſame kind, though different enough, and ſome of them much greater than his: Such Meaſures being at beſt Conjectural, and therefore ſo various, as hardly two of ten exactly, or to any purpoſe agree. But I doubt, it will appear, he hath unhappily overſeen divers perſonal Profits and Revenues, in themſelves as conſiderable, as moſt of thoſe he hath inſerted, perhaps more eaſie, clear, and certain, <hi>viz.</hi> Profeſſions, Offices; Above all, Intereſt of Money. Which, though they do not, I grant, improve, or enlarge our Fund, (indeed I could wiſh they did not, at leaſt ſome of them much impair it,) yet where the principal Aim is profeſſed to be an equal Apportionment of our Publick Contributions, ought to have been placed in the firſt Rank, and ſurely ſhould be charged to the full: The rather in my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94192:3"/>
for the very doubtful Advantage, if not indeed the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt Prejudice and Incumbrance, which ſome of them are but too apt to bring us.</p>
            <p>The diſcurſive part of his Second Chapter is very uſeful, and indeed curious; In ſhewing us, how Induſtry Co-operates wlth Nature, for our comfortable Subſiſtence, and in what Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to each other. Our Earnings he ſeems to rate with his wonted Modeſty: However, the mean Eſtimate he gives them cannot, I think, but imply, they are capable of a large and eaſie Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>In the Third Chapter he computes and compares the yearly Charges of the Kingdom with its Revenues, as ſuccinctly, yet fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and probaly, as ever yet I heard them ſtated.</p>
            <p>In his Fourth, he teaches us, how a Million <hi>per Annum,</hi> (at which he ſeems conſiderately enough to reckon our whole ordinary Expences,) may be raiſed with the leaſt Oppreſſion or Burthen. Wherein, no doubt, he were happy even to ſome Exactneſs, could we but admit the Ground-work, which he laid in his Firſt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be free from all Exceptions.</p>
            <p>The Argument of his Fifth Chapter, although it may ſeem no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, and at the firſt ſight, abrupt, is very Pertinent and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial. Suppoſing Six Millions only to be the ready Coin, or running Caſh of <hi>England,</hi> he enquires, Whether it ſuffice for the Circulations or Revolutions of a thriving Trade, and eaſily reſolves it in the Affirmative. Thereby acquainting us, That 'tis not the Species or Quantity, but the due Circulation of Money, which ought to be conſidered. Since, although we had much leſs, yet fairly Circulating, we ſhould find no lack of it; or had we much more, it would but ſtagnate, without a Regular Diſtribution: In which reſpect, by the way, methinks, it rather reſembles our Blood than our Fat. Now this will lead us to a farther neceſſary Search, what it is which thus obſtructs this due Circulation: Wherein 'twill, I think, appear, that the <hi>annual</hi> Profits or Rents of Land, being the Source, as it were, of all our Payments, or current Dealings in Trade, if inſtead of the nimble Returns, by our Author ſuppoſed, the moſt, and even the beſt of our Country Tenants be above a Year behind with their Rents, others at leaſt twice or thrice as long. Too many totally inſolvent; Abundance of our greateſt Farms, at the ſame time, either lying waſte, or being in the Tenure of hinderly, idle, or ignorant Owners, to little or no Account: whereby probably Land-Rents are now one with another in moſt
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94192:4"/>
Countries two or three Years in Arrear, and a great part of them in a manner Deſperate. If all this, I ſay, appear, as ſurely it doth, and that to the full; we need not, I truſt, reſort to a Conjurer, to learn, where the ſtoppage lies, nor will it require much Skill or Study to find, how only ſome good Proviſion for the due Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Land-Rents can now relieve us: And how that is to be Effected, ſeems alſo no <hi>Enigma.</hi> Sure I am, not by the ſole-Taxing of Land.</p>
            <p>Were the Species or Quantity of Bullion a real Cauſe of Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Payment, or of a Sound Trade, <hi>Spain,</hi> without diſpute, would then have the greateſt, whereas, God knows, ſhe hath the leaſt Share of it. Which ſhews us, how fondly ſome have doated on the Abundance of Coin; whilſt others as weakly have ſuffered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be impoſed on with a ſilly Sophiſm, <hi>viz.</hi> the Confounding of thoſe widely different Notions of Money; As of old it ever was a happy harmleſs Expedient of Commerce, and as it is unhappily now become a mighty Revenue, or Money Current with Money Lent. The former, I verily believe, in reſpect of the latter, being not One to Thirty, perhaps much more: And by our Judicious Author's Eſtimate, compared with our whole Effects, leſs than One to a Hundred.</p>
            <p>In his Sixth Chapter, he undertakes to ſhew us the Cauſes of our Irregular Taxing; whereof he there alledges divers ſpecious ones, and aptly enough enforces them; which, I grant, may all of them more or leſs have contributed, or at leaſt given colour to it. Though truly, were my late worthy Friend, Sir <hi>William Petty,</hi> living, I could not chuſe but take him aſide, whiſper ſoftly in his Ear, and only ask him, If in good earneſt he thought, That at the time when he wrote, there might have been no other Cauſes aſſigned, <hi>viz.</hi> no dark Intereſts, or rather rank Combinations, of ſome, point-blank to favour themſelves in their immediate Payments; of others, to keep the Land at an under-rate, till they had made their intended Purchaſes of it: And perhaps of others yet, to cloſe, or at leaſt comply, with the Court-Intrigues, or on other by-reſpects.</p>
            <p>His Seventh tells us of many notable Uſes, or collateral Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, to be made of the ſeveral Methods of Taxing, <hi>viz.</hi> by Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, by Poll, as well Compound as Simple, by Chimnies, by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, by Land-Tax, and by Aſſeſſment on the conceal'd Eſtates, <hi>viz.</hi> Intereſt-Monies; which I could heartily wiſh, he would have taught us his Art, how to render viſible, and thereby liable to Taxing, if not with the Cuſtom-houſe Law, in obliging them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their utmoſt Peril of Forfeiture, to unmask and Rate themſelves.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94192:4"/>
Moſt of theſe Uſes indeed are worthy of Conſideration, though ſurely in no degree comparable to the matchleſs Benefit of a mix'd general and comprehenſive Rate, (had we once the Bleſſing to light upon it,) which ſhould bring almoſt every individual Shoulder, or at leaſt every Rank, to bear its equal Share of all our Burthens. A State, having once got this great Receipt, hath, as it were, found its <hi>Elixir.</hi> And yet the Learning of it, I muſt tell you, ſeems to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, rather a towardly Diſpoſition, than a large Capacity, there being ſo fair a Pattern of it at hand, in our Neighbourhood. If by our Author's Meaſures, we could well bear the yearly Charge of four Millions: By this, I dare ſay, we might, with leſs Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, at leaſt Ten or Twelve.</p>
            <p>In his Eighth, he gives a full Account, what great things are to be done at the Expence of 3300000 <hi>l.</hi> And ſo by moderate Calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, without any extreme Preſſure or Grievance of the People: To all which, for ought I ſee, no Exception can be juſtly taken.</p>
            <p>In his Ninth he produces five effectual Motives, for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading of us to bear even our higheſt Taxes, (he means, I ſuppoſe, ſhould they be never ſo unequally laid,) with diſcreet Submiſſion. Of which, no doubt, all true Engliſh-men would in this Juncture cheerfully ſecure him, if any could warrant them, no publick Calamity, or horrible Inconvenience, <hi>viz.</hi> by Famine, or at leaſt general Impoveriſhment and Inſolvency, ſhall in a ſhort time enſue from ſuch inſupportable Burthens.</p>
            <p>His laſt Chapter hath many conſiderable Hints: And had he but done us the Favour to ſet us in a right way, how we ſhall augment, indeed multiply the Product of our Lands, (as by many modern Improvements even at the time he wrote, we had fairly begun, and daily further proceed to do beyond our Neighbours, as well as An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors,) without the rendering of it Dog-cheap, to the Ruine of Farming, and with it, in time, all honeſt Endeavour; he would therein, not only have conſummated our worldly Felicity, but crowned his whole Work.</p>
            <p>As for the mighty Succeſs he promiſes, with the prudent Direction he gives us, for Imploying all our Hands, I can only ſay, Till the Monſtrous Block of Fomenting Sloath it ſelf, with the nobleſt of Privileges, an abſolute Exemption from Taxes, and feeding it with the Spoil of Induſtry, be removed, 'tis altogether hopeleſs, but will be then as needleſs: Wiſe Nature requiring of us only her Freedom from all Conſtraint or Reſtraint, and almoſt as ill brooking to be Prompted, as Forced or Checked.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:94192:5"/>
But upon the whole Matter he hath given us, though not a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, at leaſt the uſefulleſt Map of our Country, that in my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath been hitherto made. He hath fairly ſet before us both our Strength and Weakneſs, our Advantages, together with our Defects. He hath taught us a ſort of Learning we mainly wanted, <hi>viz.</hi> the Skill of Taxing, and withal Living, I hope, by Meaſure, in relation to what we are really worth. In ſumm, He hath laid us the Ground-work of a noble Fabrick; and if thoſe, who ſhall hereafter attempt to build thereupon, (as I doubt not many good Wits, as well as publick Spirits, will endeavour,) acquit but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves half like Sir <hi>William Petty,</hi> we may ſoon expect to ſee a Mauſoleum. Yet as excellent Pictures have always at firſt their rough or dead Draughts, and no work of the greateſt Moment was ever at once, or perhaps at twice or thrice conſummated; He hath withall made ſome Blots or Overſights, ſuch as, in good troth, I ſcarce expected from ſo rare an Artiſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He ſhould, I humbly conceive, have taken his Flight or Riſe from a Previous Diſcourſe on the vaſt Conſequences of equal or unequal Taxing. It may perhaps here be ſaid, The very Title of his Treatiſe imports no leſs: And beſides, he hath therein ſcát<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered divers pertinent Reflections of that Tenour. Yet the Matter, I take it, would well have borne, indeed deſerved his expreſs and accurate handling of it. Wherein moſt aptly, as well as evidently, he might have ſhewn, how all Nations have from time to time declined or flouriſhed, in proportion to their due or undue Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of Contribution: How to the latter of theſe may be fairly imputed moſt of the famous Revolts of Provinces, Enthralments of Free Countries, violent Changes of Government, with other Calamities, and even Depopulations, which we meet with in our Chronicles. How from the ſame Root have likewiſe ſprung the fouleſt Corruptions of Manners, with the moſt Notorious Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals: It manifeſtly diſpoſing, if not rather expoſing, one part of any People to all the Enormities attending vaſt Superfluity; the other to the diſhoneſt Shifts and Practices of an indigent Fortune. Whereby, betwixt the vain Pomp, with the Luxury and Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance of ſuch, as ſwimming in Wealth, yet contribute little or nothing to the Publick; and the lamentable Diſtreſſes, irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilable Grudges, indeed deadly Feuds of thoſe, who under their ſtraight Circumſtances, bearing in effect the whole Burthen, find themſelves thereby ſuddenly ſupplanted, and many of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from a Plentiful Eſtate to Beggary with Contempt; All Vertue muſt needs expire, all Vices enter with a Torrent: And
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94192:5"/>
there is neither Miſchief nor Crime, to which this Oppreſſion, where it is extream, or of long Continuance, may not with colour enough be entitled. If I be not much deceived, our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Rates further purſued, will in a ſhort time leave us as little Goodneſs, or real Worth, as Wealth.</p>
            <p>I look it ſhould here be objected, That the very Language of Equal Taxing, is meerly <hi>Platonick</hi> and <hi>Utopian;</hi> That there never was, will, or can be, any ſuch <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hing reduced to Practice, no not of old in the pureſt ſtate of <hi>Rome,</hi> or now in <hi>Holland,</hi> or <hi>Swiſſerland.</hi> That it ſounds Seditious, and is only fit for Demagogues, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to incenſe the Mobile. To which give me leave to anſwer with this ſincere Proteſtation, that I never once ſo much as dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of any perfect Equality, well knowing, that in all ſuch Caſes there would be fair Grains of Allowance for Practical Miſcarriages. But ſtill, in Gods name, let them be only Grains, not Ounces, and much leſs Pounds. To this our ingenious Author, no doubt, would readily have ſubſcribed. And ſurely were our Diſproportions but double, (however inconſiſtent even that muſt be with a thriving Commonwealth,) yet few, I dare ſay, would now even murmur. I freely anſwer for One.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I could not eaſily, without ſeeing, have believed; That in ſuch an Enquiry, one of our Author's Noſtrils ſhould hardly mention Intereſt Money, ſave in ſome ſort to excuſe or extenuate its Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, as alſo that he ſhould write with ſo little concernment of our ſole Land-Taxes. But am throughly ſcandalized, he ſhould ſo forget his own dear Art of Arithmetick, in his wrong Meaſures of them. He tells us, forſooth, In a Monthly Land-Tax of ſeventy thouſand Pounds, Landlords pay two Shillings in the Pound: which is ſure a ſtrange Miſreckoning in all but Ground-Rents; ſeeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly founded on the Erroneous Suppoſal, that all our Land-Rents are ſuch. Whereas one would think, it ſhould now require ſmall Skill in Accounts, as well as little Experience, to know, That allowing for heavy Repairs, with other endleſs Charges, incident to all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates in the Country, there muſt needs be paid to ſuch a Land-Tax at leaſt four Shillings in the Pound, not perhaps of Rents reſerved, yet doubtleſs of ſuch as are received <hi>de claro.</hi> For I dare affirm, take our Landlords round, they pay thereunto much more than dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, conſidering, how many of the prime Nobility and Gentry, owing great Summs, pay their Creditors Taxes, as well as their own; How many again having Eſtates far remote from their Dwellings, through their Farms lying Vacant, or Tenants failing, in many Years ſee little of Rent, yet hardly avoid the Payment of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94192:6"/>
all Seſſes, as well Parochial as Publick. Not to mention the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous Variety of our Marſh or Fenny Grounds, our mean Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle-Rents, our Wind-mills and Water-mills, with abundance of others, obnoxious either to deadly Caſualties or heavy Charges, and oft-times to both. So that, by as current Eſtimates, as moſt of theſe our Author offers, it ſeems highly probable, the Monthly Aſſeſſment even of ſeventy thouſand Pounds, to ſpeak modeſtly, in moſt places is not diſcharged with a full Noble in the Pound of the Liquid Rents of Land.</p>
            <p>He admits indeed, a Fourth part of the People bears our whole Burthen, which, to do him right, is much more than hitherto hath been allowed, and would heretofore have paſſed for a monſtrous Paradox. Yet if it be made appear, that 'tis not bearly a Fourth, but a Ninth, or Tenth, indeed I dare hardly gueſs, how ſmall a part of the Nation bears our whole Charge; Though we ſtill muſt own his Ingenuity, both in diſcovering and granting to us ſo much, yet I cannot chuſe but reflect on his Over-ſight, either in obſerving or yielding no more.</p>
            <p>His Eſtimate of a Fourth he ſeems fairly enough to ground upon the Exemption in effect of the whole Commonalty, and of migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Stocks in Trade. But he ſtrangly paſſes by both Offices and Profeſſions, which may well be computed near equal to our Land-Rents, as now they are charged: Above all, little notice he takes of Eſtates concealed at Intereſt, which in all likelihood, are ſtill, as they long have been, the greater half of our real Fund.</p>
            <p>I muſt needs confeſs, on my firſt general View hereof, I thought it next to impoſſible, that all of theſe together much leſs any one of them ſingly ſhould for Revenue balance our Land-Rents. But diſcourſing ſince thereof with Perſons of approved Inſight and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience; Beſides on a fair Review conſidering, how on the one ſide, not only the chief Eſtates of the Nobility and Gentry have long been, and are ſtill grievouſly incumbred with Debts, or at leaſt with Portions, but the greateſt part of our petty Traders, as well as Farmers, now pay one with another, to ſpeak Modeſtly, more than Six <hi>per cent,</hi> for the better half of their Wares and Stocks, though few of them, in their ſeveral ways of Dealing, can raiſe near ſo much: On the other ſide weighing, how Moneys at Uſe are notoriouſly the Proviſion in effect of all younger Children, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of moſt Men of Profeſſion or Office, the ſureſt Income of our Ableſt, whether Wholeſale or Retail Traders, the general Livelihood of our old Men, retired from Affairs, I am now fully convinced, that coming ſo clear, and being ſo amply ſecured, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94192:6"/>
by Mortgages or Sureties, our Intereſt of Money muſt far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed our<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Land Revenues, incumbred as now they are, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with their unſteady Payments, wretched Securities, and heavy conſtant Charges, beſides all extraordinary Burthens. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, as was ſaid before, it plainly appears to be much more than Equivalent, if not to Land-Rents reſerved, yet at leaſt to thoſe received.</p>
            <p>That Profeſſions and Offices are alſo betwixt them near equal to the Land-Rents, ſeems as reaſonable a Meaſure, as the moſt of thoſe our ingenious Author hath offered us: That to at leaſt forty or fifty Capital Aids within memory, they have not paid above twice or thrice, is matter of Fact, and that no yearly Profits ought to be more ſtrictly charged than they, methinks ſpeaks it ſelf; By reaſon of their clear and even daily Income, the conſtant gradual Encreaſe of their Cuſtomary Fees, with their immediate dependance upon the State, for Privilege and Favor. In which reſpects, I ſuppoſe, among our Adverſaries of <hi>France,</hi> they with the Clergy, 'tis ſaid, now bear the main Expence of this heavy War.</p>
            <p>Our Prudent Author himſelf computes our People, with their Labor and Suſtenance, to hold much the like Proportion with all our other Effects, as five and twenty doth to fifteen, but treble at leaſt to our Land-Rents: And thence judiciouſly infers, that they, as well as any, may bear their <hi>Quota</hi> of all publick Burthens, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the Subſtance of ſo great an aggregate Body, which, as he likewiſe aptly ſhews us, would probably amount to our Wiſh, in an eaſie Poll, oft repeated, or gentle Exciſe well placed, or both. A Propoſal now ſeemingly much enforced by the daily dangerous Growth of Wages, concurrent with the Fall of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions and Rents. Were this Nail driven home, it would alone much alleviate the Charge of our Lands: Though ſtill I conceive, only the mixed comprehenſive Rate, equally reaching and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting at leaſt all Ranks, can upon great and inſtant Occaſions ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our Burthens eaſie, or indeed tolerable.</p>
            <p>Our Trade is either Forein or Domeſtick: The former of theſe, I would willingly believe, our Author ſets at too low a Rate, <hi>viz.</hi> an Eight part only of our Effects<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sure I am, it ſhould, and eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly might be more, or we have too much doated on it, as if it had been our main Support. This in Prudent Governments hath ever been lightly charged for the benefit of Navigation. Indeed it feels even the ſmalleſt Impoſts, its Hazards being great and many; And if it cannot ply the Market with the Cheapeſt, 'twere better
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94192:7"/>
for it to ſtay at home; A Grain or Scruple oft-times turning that Scale as well as an Ounce. With Submiſſion therefore, I wiſh it in great meaſure diſcharged, and the Duties elſewhere laid, as with eaſe enough, for ought I ſee, they might. But then it would be likewiſe well balanced, eſpecially with the neceſſary and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Arts of curbing our Sloath and Luxury. For the latter, <hi>viz.</hi> Domeſtick, and chiefly Retail Trade, why ſhould it not bear its full ſhare of all our Burthens? Though none, I confeſs, like In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of Money, with ſome other Liquid Revenues, which, I dare aver, now to rate them equally, deſerve at the leaſt a double Charge. The vaſt Stocks herein employ'd would without much hardſhip yield us a fair Supply, to the eaſe and benefit both of Land and Forein Trade. Without much hardſhip indeed: For the Charge, which through the preſent Miſchief of ſole Taxing, now cruſhes the Land, and by Conſequence will ere long cruſh all, were it tollerably divided, would be no more than a Flea-bit to any. Rather on the contrary, there is hardly one well-meaning Perſon here among us, but would quickly feel the benign Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of that honeſt and wiſe Maxim, <hi>Live and let live.</hi> So as it may well be ſaid, whoſoever oppoſes, grudges, or induſtriouſly avoids equality of Taxing, upon the matter aloud declares, he would fire his Neighbor's Houſe, or rather, as far as in him lies, ſet his Country it ſelf on a Flame, merely to Roaſt his own Eggs. And to Argue, as ſtill our Sophiſters do, that Taxes ſhould not, indeed cannot be equally laid, as it is only <hi>Gratis dictum,</hi> and moſt abominably ſelfiſh, ſo in this Juncture, I doubt, it Tolls our Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing bell.</p>
            <p>Thus betwixt the Swarms of our People, with the vaſt Stocks of our Trade, by our ingenious Author ſpecified, Intereſt of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, Offices, Profeſſions, &amp;c. now be ſuperadded, all which in our Land-Taxes are not only at preſent excuſed, but have, for at leaſt forty Years paſt, ſeldom and lamely, God knows, contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to our almoſt innumerable heavy Burthens; To me it ſeems undeniable, that a very ſmall part of the Nation, (how ſmall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, is ſcarce credible) hath all along borne the Charges of the whole. With this ſevere Aggravation, that the Parties hereby grieved have in effect only been our Induſtry and our Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which ſhould, if any, have been favoured, thoſe excuſed the Sloathful with the Vulgar. So as we are rather to marvel, we are not already ſwallowed up, as it were, in a Gulph or Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, or how we ſtill ſubſiſt as a Nation, under ſo long a Progreſs of ſuch Hardſhips than, that at the length, after Civil War, attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:94192:7"/>
with ſuch Rigors, beſide much Unſettlement, it hath brought Land-Rents to ſo low an Ebb, and ſo ſad an After-game; not to be retrieved, I am confident, without the ſpeedy Expedient of a juſt and general Rate, wherein all our Revenues ſhall keep even pace with Land. And we may farther fairly conclude, that had it not been for theſe lurching, indeed Muthering Taxes, our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates in the main had been long ſince free from Incumbrance, our Farms well letten, our Rents duly paid, on yearly Advance, and few or no Complaints in our Streets. In Summ, we had doubtleſs been ere this, with Gods uſual bleſſing on honeſt and prudent Means, the Envy of all Mankind, and a ſort of earthly Paradiſe: No Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple under Heaven, all things conſidered, having naer the like Ingredients of Safety, Plenty and Power, as we.</p>
            <p>'Twas in a dark Age, we gave our Monaſteries, with other Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious Endowments, the odious Nick-name or Brand of Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains; Though they generally paid their full <hi>Quotas</hi> in War, and in Peace upon the matter eaſed us of the vaſt Charge of our Poor, beſides other publick Works. Alas, here are Proteſtant Mortmains indeed of a larger Size, enough to ſink us to the Center, and ſuddenly turn even this happy <hi>Arabia</hi> into a Deſert.</p>
            <p>Our want of Publick Spirits is now the common Complaint: But where or how ſhould we look for them? I cannot Divine, what famous Exploits for the Commonwealth, in extraordinary Exigences, we are to promiſe our ſelves from ſuch as have all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long declined to afford it their ordinary Support or Aid: They ſhould, methinks, ſcarce pretend to be <hi>Cato</hi>'s or <hi>Regulus</hi>'s. And for thoſe, who deſerving from their Country, perhaps of any the beſt, are by it treated like Aliens, or rather like Enemies, 'tis fair, I hope, if they be not <hi>Catilines.</hi> Without ſome Juſtice on the one ſide, there is ſeldom much kindneſs on the other: We are not over-apt to mourn, at leaſt ſincerely, for Stepmothers.</p>
            <p>Now though my late worthy Friend, Sir <hi>William Petty,</hi> did not himſelf fully befriend us with theſe ſo important Truths, yet hath he left us a moſt uſeful Platform or Scheme of future Taxing: And from his Torch I fairly own to have lighted mine.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I could not but hope, The Meaſures of Domeſtick Exciſe would on this Account naturally have occurred to our Author's Enquiry, That he would have dived into the Nature of it, as an Argument moſt worthy his Scrutiny: So to have taught us, what Commodities may beſt bear it, and in what Proportions, as alſo with what Returns. Which for that he hath but lightly touched, waving all ſuch particular Examens, as wholly out of my Sphere,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94192:8"/>
I ſhall only in general offer you my preſent Thoughts, what are the ſeeming Advantages or Inconveniences, attending this ſort of Tax; which being fairly repreſented, it will be the eaſier for you to frame a Judgment of it.</p>
            <p>Exciſe, you know, hath obtained a current Repute of perfect Equality: Now though I may by no means admit of that; not only Niggards, but all thoſe, whoſe Condition obliges them not to live Honourably upon their Demeans, at pleaſure avoiding it; yet I muſt allow, 'tis, ſingly conſidered, perhaps the moſt equal, and Innocent of any particular way of Taxing, commonly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed or diſcourſed of; excepting Impoſts on ſome Forreign hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Superfluities, for the due regulating of Trade. It hath at firſt ſight a notable Air and Aſpect of Freedom, every one being indeed his own Aſſeſſor: It riſes almoſt inſenſibly, bringing the Multitude, (who are more apt to murmur at integral Taxes,) without much Grudging, to pay their Quota's in this. It affects not immediately the Fund of Land, as our ſole Land-Taxes miſchievouſly do: And ſo powerfully doth it recommend, indeed preach Frugality, that, to ſay the truth, It in a manner condemns all Unthrifts, as meer Ideots or Lunaticks.</p>
            <p>But withall 'tis a Mineral, which ought to be corrected, or elſe with us will turn rank Poyſon, and may prove only in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects a little better than our preſent ſole Land-Taxes; which if they have not already, muſt ſoon bring our Noble to Nine-pence: Beſides that generally ſpeaking, 'tis a known high Road to Slavery, <hi>Gabelles</hi> and <hi>Sabots</hi> being almoſt inſeparable. The Land would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currently be otherwiſe relieved, and in ſome meaſure ſet upon even ground with Trades, Profeſſions and Offices, above all with Uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>money, by the moſt moderate Rate of Intereſt: Without which, the greateſt part of thoſe, who ſell either Land or its Product, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill neceſſitous and under Hatches, will be but too much at the Mercy of their Chapmen, eſpecially of our Interloping Traders, <hi>viz.</hi> Meal-men, Maltſters, &amp;c. to work upon their Exigencies, and not deal with them, unleſs on Ruinous Terms, at leaſt with full Allowance for the Duty they muſt pay. Indeed, however expedient or harmleſs Exciſe of it ſelf, or in our abſtracted Notion of it, may be or ſeem, it cannot, I fear, without a powerful Allay, be ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable in a Juncture, when our principal Native Commodities are already ſo Dog-cheap: Neither were it, I preſume, undeſerving our ſerious Thought, How a general Thrift in Houſhold-Expence, (the Famous Conſequence of Exciſe) will comply, or even conſiſt with our Improvements, the doubling of our Product, and its daily
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:94192:8"/>
growing under-value. Whether at this rate we do not toſs and tumble, like a Sick Man, who ſeeks, as the Saying is, for his Pillow, but cannot find it; or as a ſqueafie Stomach is apt to change old <hi>Aquavitae</hi> for new Brandy.</p>
            <p>I do not ſo much inſiſt on the general Objection of former times, <hi>viz.</hi> the Multiplying of Officers, whereby, beſides other dangerous Inconveniences, half the Water is apt to run from the Mill: In hope Expedients may be found for cheap and eaſie Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, the only Convenience of Land-Taxes. But in truth the Difficulties of adapting an Exciſe to mighty urgent Occaſions, ſeem as it were inſuperable. For in ſuch caſe it would prove too Penal, if it ſhould fall very ſhort, and ſurely no way expedient, ſhould it much exceed. Now who can any thing near compute, how Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſts, when newly laid, or without trial of them, will riſe? How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they ought, I conceive, to be light: For if heavy, they cruſh like Mill-ſtones, where-ever they fall. Upon which account, they ſurely ſeem moſt applicable to a ſtanding Revenue, The mixed and comprehenſive Quota, or Tax upon all Abilities, in nature of the Dutch two or three hundredth Penny for all extraordinary Purpoſes, having, I think, no Fellow.</p>
            <p>If it be alledged, That our Landlords, who ſo long have been oppreſſed, will hereby at leaſt take Breath, indeed be much eaſed in their Payments: So, ſay I, to appearance, is the Tenant in our preſent Taxes; who yet tells us another Story, by daily woful Experience ſinking under them, and fully Sympathizing with the Landlord in all theſe Hardſhips. So, I doubt, ſhall we with our Tenants, in a large Impoſt on their Commodities. Whereof the Gentry in <hi>France,</hi> who ſo vainly boaſt of their Privileges herein, will give us a fair, or rather a foul Account.</p>
            <p>But 4. It were to be wiſhed, our Author had diſcovered to us (as indeed who better could?) the Cauſes of our wretched Cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, although our Crops be never ſo mean, and our notorious prodigal Expence, even in times of ſoareſt Complaint, for the loſs of Rents, Deadneſs of Trade, and Scarcity of Current Money, together with the neceſſary Conſequences thereof. Which, how Forreign ſoever at the firſt ſight it may ſeem to his Arithmetick, yet in treating of Political Meaſures, would no doubt have been as pertinent, at leaſt as uſeful, as any thing he hath, or could have handled. Now for the fatal Cheapneſs oppreſſing us, as well now, as when he wrote, there is, methinks, no great Myſtery in it. Five times, I think, within Memory, hath the like Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous want of Vent for all the Product of Land ſignally afflicted
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:94192:9"/>
us; yet never, unleſs in times of ſole Land-Taxes; which plainly points out to us, as with a Finger, whence it proceeds, <hi>viz.</hi> from the over-taxing of Landlords, and ſo diſabling them liberally to take off the Farmers Commodities towards their Rent, to ſpend them, as their worthy Anceſtors did, in generous Houſe-keeping upon the Place, much in the nature of ſtill laying the Compoſt upon the Farm: For want whereof Poor Tenants are now generally forced to ply remote Markets, and chiefly that of our great Metropolis; which being thus cloid, they muſt, as before was ſaid, ſell at the Diſcretion of Crafty Interlopers. That this is ſingly the caſe, The univerſal Complaint, as well in all thoſe Junctures, as at preſent, of too many Gentlemens aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning the Country, or living but obſcurely in it, I hope, enough evinces.</p>
            <p>Indeed how ſhould it be otherwiſe? For admitting, all things computed, <hi>viz.</hi> Want or Inſolvency of Tenants, Charges of Managery, Vaſt and Cumberſome Repairs, with the many other Defalcations now incident to Eſtates, that they one with another receive hardly half their Revenues, (and well I may ſay, would to God they could promiſe themſelves ſo much, even thoſe few that are out of Debt,) How ſhould any of them with long Trains ſubſiſt, much more provide for Poſterity, except they contract their Houſhold Expences, even to the undoing of their Tenants, as well as their own Eclipſe.</p>
            <p>If an inconvenient Rate of Intereſt, though it ſeemed imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to concern only the Parties in Debt, who before the Civil War were few in Compariſon, could yet ſo miſerably embaſe our Native Commodities, as, that then it did, at large appears by the Famous Preamble of the Statute made for Reducement thereof, 21 <hi>Jacobi,</hi> Reciting, <q>That it then cauſed a very great Abatement in the value of Land, and all the Merchandiſes, Wares and Commodities of this Kingdom, that it diſabled Men to pay their Debts, and continue the Maintenance of Trade, that it enforced them to ſell their Lands and Stocks at very low Rates, to forſake the uſe of Merchandiſe and Trade, and to give over their Farms, and ſo become unprofitable Members of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, &amp;c.</q> How much more ſuch a horrid Rate of Taxes, univerſally charged on the Land, as on that behalf muſt needs amount to much more than the doubling of our Intereſt? Sure I am, heavy Impoſts on Native Commodities have by long Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience ever brought them to be meer Nutſhe's; even as in Forreign Trade, they likewiſe are reputed little leſs than Counterbands.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:94192:9"/>
For our Luxury, both then and now, to be ſure, alike unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, it were not hard to ſhew, that all ſuch Exceſs proceeds from Cauſes almoſt as natural, as Snow, Rain, or any Meteor, The Ringleaders thereof being apparently thoſe, who with their conceal'd Eſtates have all along gone Scot-free, and chiefly the Female Sex. Indeed cheap living ſufficiently prompts the Poor, Wanton Emulation the Richer ſort; Diſproportion of publick Rates enables and diſpoſes many to lead, but in pure Self-defence obliges, and even provokes far more to follow all Extravagant Modes. <hi>Sic vivimus ambitiosâ paupertate omnes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They have a common Saying in <hi>France,</hi> that how grievous ſoever the Taxes, or hard the Times be, there is ſtill Money ſtirring enough to be Drunk and Fine. Now Gallantry and Debauch are known to conſiſt in meer Superfluities, and thoſe chiefly, or rather only, Forreign. Nothing of our own, whether Growth or Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture, is in thoſe caſes at all eſteemed: Nor doth any of our Fair Ladies take her ſelf to be well dreſſed in Woollen, or our Sparks well treated with Homeſpun Liquors. How many, through the deadly Cheapneſs of all our Native Commodities, can now afford to drink Wine, wear Velvet, and eat Anchovies, who, did but Houſhold Proviſions bear a due Rate, would be, as their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors were, proud of honeſt Stuffs, glad of good Small Beer, with Ale or Strong Drink on Holidays, and content with Sprats? So clearly doth our Riot and Cheapneſs Feed and Foment each other; which might, one would think, naturally guide us to the ready Cure of both, only by not oppreſſing the Land.</p>
            <p>What are the direct Conſequences of them, can hardly need either Proof or Illuſtration. I am but too ſenſible, How the Vulgar ever doated on Cheapneſs, as the very Fewel of their Sloath. They call it Plenty, nay Mannah it ſelf; and wonder any ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrue it otherwiſe than they do, <hi>viz.</hi> for a Sovereign Bleſſing. Whereas all that either think or read muſt know, Dog-cheapneſs, aud the general low Values of the Product in any Country, are, and have ever been reputed a kind of Plague-Tokens, and Epitome of Miſeries, above all Peremptory to publick Freedom, indeed an immediate Inlet to Deſpotick Empire. That the very ſound of them is the ſame with Beggary; they plucking up Induſtry all at once by the Root, eſpecially that of the Plow. For inſtance whereof, we need not go ſo far as the <hi>Eaſt</hi> or <hi>Weſt Indies:</hi> Not only <hi>France,</hi> but <hi>Ireland</hi> affording us notable Patterns of it at our very Doors. That to conſummate our ſad Proſpect of them, They manifeſtly tend to, and generally end in utter Famine:
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94192:10"/>
Witneſs that ever Memorable <hi>Egyptian</hi> Plenty, the clear reſult whereof was, That they, who one Year ſold their Corn for a Song, the next, or at leaſt ſoon after, ſold themſelves for Corn.</p>
            <p>The diſmal Effects of Luxury are a common place, wherewith all Claſſick Authors ſuperabound; <hi>Saevior Armis Luxuria; Plus Gula quam Gladius,</hi> &amp;c. Yet how Fatal and Enormous ſoever, It is and hath always been a Plauſible, nay a very Popular Evil. To ſay all herein at once, It commonly fares with Nations alike as with Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies; whilſt fair Eſtates are in the ſpending, there is ever won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Plenty; nothing to be ſeen or heard, but Merriment.
