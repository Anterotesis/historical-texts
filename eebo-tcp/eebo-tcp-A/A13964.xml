            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For ſuch is the blinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of men, and ſo great is their raſhnes, to runne and ruſh on to their own deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that as there was neuer any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo rude, but would haue taken it in euill part to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in religion: So at this day a man ſhall finde many which haue ſo hardened themſelues in that religion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they were borne, which their forefathers haue obſerued, which they ſee to make for their dignities and aduaunce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and which they perceiue to be mainteyned by the greater part of men: that they wil not endure once to heare the iudgement and doctrine of the contrarie ſide, but contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to all law, both of God and man, doe condemne ſhunne, and abhore it, being neither heard, nor vnderſtoode by them.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, certaine Epicures and graceles men alſo, do
<pb facs="tcp:855:4"/>
not a little trouble the godlie, which growe to ſuch outrage, that they thinke they deſerue great commendation, if they can conceale and hide their owne iudgement, in the matter of ſaluation, and ſcoffe and frumpe at all religion of other men.</p>
            <p>Hereunto is added the preſumption of the Popes, Cardinals, Biſhops, and other Prelates, who although they ſée that many corruptions, both of doctrine, and alſo of ceremonies and diſcipline, are crept in, yet they accounte it an hainous offence, if any man, not content with their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall and confuſed faith, dares to examine the doctrine of men by the rule of the Prophets and Apoſtles writinges, and by ſearching the Scriptures, to ſéeke out the way of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation in them.</p>
            <p>Which things although they thus ſtande, yet ought all the godlie to be ſtrengthened in minde, and encouraged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſo many offences, to yeelde a reaſon of their beléefe, to the ende that both the wicked maie be made vnexcuſable before Gods iudgement ſeate, and that thoſe, which not ſo much vpon froward malice, as by reaſon of their firſt tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vp, or following of their forfathers, or finally through loue of preferments, haue condemned ſincere doctrine, that ſuch (I ſay) may not ſticke to let themſelues be ouercome with the mightie worde of God. For <hi>Ezechias,</hi> (a moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious prince) is commended, becauſe neither by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of his father <hi>Achas,</hi> profeſſing a contrarie religion, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by that bringing vp which he had from his cradle, nor by the highnes of his Royall ſtate, nor finallie, by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident of other kings, and multitude of men following an other contrarie religion, hee could be withdrawen and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged from learning himſelfe the ſincere religion, out of the wel-ſprings of Iſrael: that is to ſay, out of the word of God, conteined in the writings of the Prophets: or from enioyning his Subiects to obſerue and practiſe the ſame, when he had learned it himſelfe, and cauſed it to be purged
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:855:4"/>
from all corruptions. For he had learned the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lord, wherein he geueth in charge, that all the faithfull be bound not to walke in the commandementes of their fathers, nor to doe their iudgements, but to walke in the precepts of the Lord only, and to kéepe and do his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Neither ought the credite either of traditions, or of Councels, or Fathers, or myracles, or ſucceſſion, no nor of an Angell from heauen, to withdrawe any man from this ſearching, and peruſing of the word of God: for it was no leſſe wiſelie then rightly ſaid, <hi>More credite is to be geuen to one skilful in the Scriptures, and alleadging the catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Panormitane, and Gerſon.</note> 
               <hi>authoritie of the Canonicall Scripture, then either to the expoſition of the Pope, or to a generall Councel.</hi> By all this therefore it is manifeſt, how, not onelie harde, but alſo dangerous a thing it is, to deal in the matter of religion.</p>
            <p>Which charge if I had taken vpon me, being not forced with any neceſſitie to ſpeake, but moued thereunto eyther with vaine-glorie, or fooliſh raſhnes: doubtleſſe I could not auoide iuſt reproofe. But now ſith I haue ſtepped foorth to ſpeake, not voluntarilie, but by conſtraint, addreſſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto not with ambition, but with loue of the trueth, not vnaduiſedly, but vpon good deliberation, not with ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and cauilles, but with authoritie of the word of God: Truely I nothing feare, that this my honeſt meaning to mainteine the trueth, ſhould be imputed to me as a faulte, Onely this I requeſt you (gentle Readers) whoſoeuer are deſirous of eternall life, that you bring not hether any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice, or foreſtalled opinion, that you condemne not a cauſe vnheard, contrarie to all lawe, both of God and man, and that you leane not to any authoritie or excellencie of men: but compare matter with matter, reaſon with reaſon, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument with argument, by the rule of the worde of God: neither doe you conſider the perſon that ſpeaketh, but the matter that is ſpoken, with a godly deſire to learne out
<pb facs="tcp:855:5"/>
the truth. And then I will not ſticke to abide the curteous cenſures of the good, that if it be prooued, that theſe thinges are agréeable to the trueth of God, yee may yéeld vnto the Lord: if not, ye may refuſé them, as things contrarie to the heauenlie oracles or teſtimonies of the word. But that I may not ſéeme to roue from the matter: I wil preſcribe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine bounds, which neither I, in ſpeaking, nor you in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, may ouer-paſſe. But before this be done, I will firſt ſet downe the whole ſtate of the matter. <hi>Hearken ye kings and Princes, and all ye inhabitants of the world.</hi> There is a great controuerſie in hand: For almightie God, the moſt gracious father of all the faithfull, hath promiſed to all men that beleeue, as to his children, beloued in his onely begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſonne, he hath promiſed to them, I ſay, the kingdome of heauen. This promiſe of a heauenlie inheritance hath hee enrolled in the publique records of the olde and new teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and committed it to his heires, being ſealed with the ſeale of the Sacraments.</p>
            <p>Now he hath annexed to theſe letters of his will, certain conditions, as a father: to the performance whereof, his heires ſhould be bound. Now the children falling at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, are deuided (to omit the reſt) into two ſides, extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie diſagréeing among themſelues. The one acknowledgeth the Pope for their head, and as it were, the Executor of the will maker, God: the other acknowledgeth it not. They ſtriue for the poſſeſſion of the kingdome of heauen, and for the right of the true church, which each ſide chalengeth as their due. The Plaintife in this caſe is the Biſhoppe of Rome, with all thoſe which take parte with the <hi>See of Rome.</hi> The Defendantes are thoſe which receiue not the Biſhop of Rome, but profeſſe themſelues Goſpellers, and men of the reformed religion.</p>
            <p>Both of them bring their allegations, their writings, ſealed with the kings ſeale, and alſo their witneſſes: but both ſides kéepe great ſtirre for the aſſigning of a Iudge.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:855:5"/>
For both deſire that he ſhould be appointed Iudge, whom they hope would be more fauourable to their cauſe. The Romiſh See would ſtande to the iudgement of the Popes, <note place="margin">The pleading and exception of both ſides, for the aſsign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a Iudge.</note> traditions, councels, fathers, and miracles, and ſaith that yet neuertheleſſe, ſhee doeth not ſhutte out the worde of God.</p>
            <p>The Goſpellers on the other ſide refuſe theſe Iudges: for they alledge that the Pope cannot haue the place both of a partie, and a Iudge too, eſpeciallie ſith hee is charged with ſo many crimes. Traditions they reiect as ſuſpected Iudges, and not of ſufficient credite. And as for Councels, Fathers, Myracles, and ſucceſſion of perſons, they ſay that they admitte them not as Iudges, but as ſworne witneſſes: wherein notwithſtanding, they proteſt, that they wil ſo far foorth only receiue the authoritie of theſe witneſſes, as their euidence ſhall agrée with the publique déede.</p>
            <p>The Sée of Rome accuſeth the Goſpellers, (for let mée with good leaue of both ſides, vſe theſe termes that are now made common) that they haue reuolted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the true church, inuented a new doctrine, and newe ceremonies, and haue but a fewe yeares ſince, picked this quarrell with her, and that therefore the kingdome, and claime of heauen doeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, not to them, but to her, by the lawe of God.</p>
            <p>The Goſpellers replie that they haue departed, not from the true Church, but from the Sinagogue of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant, and that they haue not coyned a newe doctrine, or newe ceremonies, but that they holde that Religion, by the which the faithfull, euer ſince the beginning of the worlde, haue beene ſaued.</p>
            <p>That they were in déede of later yeares oppreſſed by their tyrannie, as <hi>Abell</hi> was by <hi>Cain, Iſaak</hi> by <hi>Iſmaell,</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> by <hi>Eſau:</hi> ſo that they were compelled to hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, but that now they haue (like the Moone) recouered their light, and that they will by lawe recouer their birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:855:6"/>
In this Court of ſonnes going to lawe one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, there is great concourſe and throng of people, a great hurlie burlie and ſtirre ariſeth, they growe from wordes to blowes, to murthers, to burnings, to warres, to bloudſhed, and in a word, to all kinde of torments. Sometimes this ſide ſéemeth to haue the better hand, ſometimes that, and the more that the Goſpellers are ſuppreſſed, tormented and burned, the more doe they boaſt that they growe, encreaſe, preuaile and triumph. In the meane ſeaſon they proteſt, that the matter ought to be tried, not by violence, but by courſe of lawe.

And in the meane ſpace they ſay, that they are readie to waite for the righteous Iudge, euen the Lorde Chriſt, who ſhall come to iudge both the quicke &amp; the dead: and to ende theſe long contentions in ſuch ſort, that he will

            <p>This is the doctrin of both parties, the deciding of which controuerſie the <hi>See of Rome</hi> would ſubmit to Popes, counſels, fathers, the Church, and traditions.

            <p>

               </note> they haue often times made a mocke euen of their owne Religion.

            <p>Thirdly they ſay, that the impietie of the Popes is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by this alſo, that they haue ſet vp aboue three ſcore and fiue Religious orders, each of which haue their ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall faſhions of hooded attires, and their diſtinct rules and rites of Religion.

            <p>Secondly, in that they haue chalenged vnto themſelues dominion ouer the whole world, and all ciuil magiſtrates: for as for the donation of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> wherby they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firm their ſoueraign authoritie, beſides that <hi>Antoninus</hi> biſhop of Flore<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, <hi>N.

Moreouer, euen the beſt coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels <note place="margin">The ſecond cauſe.</note> that haue béene, haue not handled all the articles of the faith, but onlye a few controuerſies, which ſpecially were toſſed &amp; beaten in their daies. Beſides this, it is manifeſt <note place="margin">The third cauſe.</note> out of ſtories, that euen in thoſe golde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> times, ſuch was part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye the pride, partlye the wilyneſſe, partlye the ignorance, and partly the wickednes of ſome Biſhops, that not the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, but the ſpirite of diſcord, may ſéeme to haue béen preſident in their councels.</p>
            <p>Finallye we read that in theſe laſt times ſuch councels <note place="margin">The fourth cauſe.</note> haue been held, wherin wicked opinions, and either vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, or hurtfull ceremonies haue béen brought in, eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed not by reaſons, or authoritie of the woord of God, but by force &amp; armes. The which things, leaſt any man might ſay, to be ſpoken ſlaunderouſly and falſely, it may be ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a breefe bedroule of the councels. For if a man ſhall peruſe the ſtories of olde times, he ſhal finde this to be moſt true, that euen as according to the old tradition of the houſe oſ <hi>Elias,</hi> the whole time of the viſtble world is deuided by <note place="margin">The tradition of the houſe of Elias.</note> two thouſands. (For there ſhall be ſixe thouſand yeeres and then the burning of all thinges, two thouſand voide, two thouſand vnder the Lawe, two thouſand the daies of
<pb facs="tcp:855:23"/>
               <hi>Meſsias,</hi> and for our ſins which are manye and great, there ſhall be wanting, the yeeres that ſhall be wanting) So likewiſe is the time of <hi>Meſsias</hi> deuided into thrée Circuits <note place="margin">Three circles or diuiſions of time in the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

Of Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople. 385. Of Epheſus 435. Of Chalcedon 455.</note> or portions, within the which alſo almoſt all Kingdomes do féel an alteration. Within theſe thrée circles, the true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Catholick Church is found to weare and waxe like to the Moone. For, for the ſpace of fiue hundreth yéeres after Chriſt, although there fell out great contentions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Sonne of God, and other weightie matters, by <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bion, Cerinthus</hi> and others, yet did the trueth preuaile, and for the ſpace of whole fiue hundred yéeres, the Church, flouriſhed and continued, as it were, at the full moone. For within this compaſſe there fel the four firſt Sinodes or aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies of the Apoſtles, and afterwards the foure generall councelles. Wherof the firſt being called togither by <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> the great, condemned <hi>Arius.</hi> The ſecond helde at Conſtantinople aſſembled by <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> confuted the <hi>Macedonians.</hi> The thirde kept at Epheſus, ſummoned by <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the ſecond, the Sonne of <hi>Archadius,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned <hi>Neſtorius.</hi> The fourth celebrated at Chalcedon, commaunded by <hi>Martianus,</hi> condemned <hi>Eutiches.</hi> The créedes of theſe foure generall councels, as expoſitions of the faith, the reformed Church dooth willingly imbrace. For they are grounded vpon the foundation of the holye <note place="margin">The ſecond circle of fiue hundred yeeres.</note> Scriptures themſelues. But in the fiue hundred yéers next following, errour did ſo wraſtle with trueth, that aſſoone as men had once ſtepped ſomewhat aſide from the path of the Scriptures, by and by many buddes of falſe opinions and hurtful ceremonies ſprung vp, and grew more and more.</p>
            <p>For in the firſt general councell held at Conſtantinople, aſſembled by the Emperour <hi>Iuſtinian,</hi> they were confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that ſaid that the body of Chriſt was incorruptible. In the ſixt, which <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the firſt, ſurnamed <hi>Barbatus,</hi> called together in the ſame place, the Monothelites were condemned. But the councels that afterwardes followed,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:855:23"/>
almoſt all of them decréee matters, either childiſh, or elſe flat contrarie to the word of God. For in the ſeuenth gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <note place="margin">788</note> councel, which at the commaundement of the Empreſſe was adiourned from Conſtantinople to <hi>Nice,</hi> it was decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not by the word of God, but by mayne force of an armie leuied out of Thracia, that images ſhould be honoured, and worſhipped. And in they eighth general councel, which when <hi>Baſilius</hi> was Emperour, was aſſembled at Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople, <note place="margin">869</note> when <hi>Adrian</hi> Biſhoppe of Rome had ſent his deputies or Leuetenants thither, and commaunded that the Church of Rome ſhould be the head of other Churches, and that the common people ſhould be debard from all choiſe of their miniſters: there grew an inward grudge betwéene the Latin and Gréeke Churches for the ſupremacie, which continueth euen vntill this day. But in the other fiue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <note place="margin">The third cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of fiue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares,</note> yeares that remayne, there followed ſuch councells, wherein we ſee almoſte no good thing, but all wicked and fonde thinges rather, eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>At the councell of Ments (for let me, out of each of theſe <note place="margin">1049</note> hundreds, picke and cull foorth one ſinod a péece, for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſting of the matter) whereat both the Pope, and the Emperour were preſent, with an hundred and thirtie Biſhops, there was conſultatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the forbidding of prieſts marriage.</p>
            <p>In the councel held at Brixia, which was called by the Emperour <hi>Henry, Gregorie</hi> the ſeuenth for his villanies <note place="margin">1080</note> before mentioned, was depoſed.

            <p>There was a councel aſſembled at Baſil when the ſame <note place="margin">1431</note> 
               <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> was Emperour, wherein it was decréed, that the Popes ought to be ſubiect to the councels. Which whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it diſliked <hi>Eugenius,</hi> hee remoued the councell, firſt to Bono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, and then to Ferraria, and from thence to Florence, whereas, although <hi>Iohn Palaeologus</hi> the Emperour of the Grecians, vpon hope of ſuccour againſt the Turkes, and the Ruſſians alſo, did promiſe obedience to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sée of Rome, yet notwithſtanding afterwards when they were returned whome, &amp; the reſt for good cauſes would not agrée to them, there could be no peace concluded with the Pope.</p>
            <p>At length alſo <hi>Iulius</hi> the ſecond called a councel at La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terane, <note place="margin">1511</note> and <hi>Paule</hi> the third at Trent: in the which becauſe they procéeded not according to the rules preſcribed in the <note place="margin">1552</note> worde of God, therefore the Goſpellers affirme that they are not bound to their decrées.

If you meane the former, who will not receyue ſuch traditions?</p>
            <p>If the later, who may not without any breach of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, reiect them? And how much Traditions doe auaile to appeaſe and ceaſſe the contentions of the Church, olde Stories doe plainly ſhew.</p>
            <p>For when as in the moſt auncient times, there aroſe a ſturre in the Church concerning the feaſt of Eaſter, with ſo great a doo, that the whole world was ſhaken therewith, <note place="margin">Socrat. lib. 5. cap. 22. Auguſt. ad Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulam. Epiſt. 86.</note> both ſides had recourſe to the traditions of the Apoſtles, which are not expreſſed in any certain Booke. But when each ſide alleadged that they kepte the feaſte of Eaſter on that time which was appointed by tradition of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles: the matter grew to this paſſe in the end, that there was a flat fréedome for the Church, in all ſuch manner of <note place="margin">Iren. epiſt. ad Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorem Epiſc.

            <p>Loe what force traditions haue to determine the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſies of Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Will miracles then make manifeſt which is the better cauſe, or the Catholick church?</hi> Why, the vſe of miracles is now ceaſed. For there is not now any new Eoſpell or <note place="margin">Aug. lib. de vera religione.</note> new doctrine broached, but that which Chriſt and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles haue already confirmed with miracles and wonders.</p>
            <p>Againe we doe not reade that all thoſe that reſtored, and as it were reformed Religion, were famous for their my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles: In the which number <hi>Iohn Baptiſt, Aſaph, Ethan, Iedithun, Heman, Core,</hi> and other Prophets, are to be reckonned. Moreouer, except the gift of miracles be lefte to the wiſe diſpoſition of God, they cannot confirme any doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:855:27"/>
For it is manifeſt that the miracles of Chriſt which otherwiſe were full of power, did either nothing at all or <note place="margin">Deut. 13. 2. Theſ. 2. Aug. quaeſi. 82. li. de orth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Finally how could miracles be neceſſarie ſignes of true Religion, of themſelues, when as it is manifeſt that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt and falſe Prophets ſhall excell with many miracles? wherefore thoſe miracle-mongers ought themſelues to be taken for miracles and wounders, who when the date, and vſe of miracles is paſt, doe yet require miracles: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the true doctrine is not euen at this day altogether deſtitude of great miracles.</p>

               <hi>of the Biſhops of Rome</hi> ſerue to diſcerne betwéene true, and falſe Religion? Surely no man will deny that there is one ſucceſſion of true doctrine, and another of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, wherefore if the ſucceſſion of Perſons be ioyned with the ſucceſſion of the Prophets, and Apoſtles doctrine, it is manifeſt doubleſſe, that the weight thereof is not ſmall.</p>
            <p>For in this ſenſe the Fathers did alleage ſucceſſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <note place="margin">In orat. Maxim. Cynicum.</note> the Hereticks. For he that profeſſeth the ſame doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine (ſaith <hi>Nezianzen)</hi> is partaker of the ſame chaire alſo: but hee that holdeth a contrarie doctrine, ought not to bee counted a Succeſſour: and truely this later hath the name in déede, but that former hath the trueth of ſucceſſion.

               </note> continuance of Pope after Pope is of no force to ſhew which is the true religion. But it may be, they will demaund of the Goſpellers, the time and perſon, wherein the ſucceſſion of doctrine was altered.</p>

our Sauiour Chriſt, as it were within thrée circles of a thouſand and fiue hundred yeares: the Church in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ſéemeth to haue by little and little, decayed.</p>
            <p>For in the firſt fiue hundred yeares, true religion began to wreſtle with errour: and in the next fiue hundred, to yeeld to it, vntill at length in the other fiue hundred yeres it was ſo ouerwhelmed, that it gaue no light on any ſide.</p>
            <p>Neither for all that doeth it followe hereupon, that either the Church was at any time cleane extinguiſhed, or <note place="margin">That the church was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer quite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.</note> that we now are at variance with the church: for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church of Chriſt hath alwaies béene, and ſhalbe alwaies, as long as the Lord Chriſt ſhall raigne, with whoſe helpe it is ſo ſupported, that yet notwithſtanding, the forme therof is not alwaies viſible.</p>

            <p>THeſe were the things (good Readers, that loue your ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,) which I thought good to write at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, concerning the appointing of a Iudge for the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſies of religion, and the finding out of the trueth of the right religion, and Catholicke Church. Wherin, becauſe I take it, that I haue ſaid nothing which I cannot make good by manifeſt proofes, either of the holy Scriptures, or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Fathers, or els euen of thoſe authours themſelues, whoſe teſtimonies I haue truely alleadged: Surely it is méete and right, that all thoſe that loue the trueth, ſhoulde be ſtirred vp to ſéeke out the way of eternall life: and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out partiall iudgement, to know the trueth of religion, and of the church: without the which, ſaluation is not to be had. And now, that which remaineth, let vs with all our hearts beſéech our onely maſter, the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, that wee may be taught many things more which wee knowe not, by him, from whom we haue receiued theſe things which we doe know: let vs pray him, that of his mercie preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vs, and furthering vs, he would teach vs thoſe thinges which being to be knowen for our comfort, wee are not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of, kéepe vs in thoſe things which we knowe to be true, ſtrengthen vs in thoſe things wherein we ſtagger, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing true, and deliuer vs from thoſe things which are falſe: that ſo in our thoughts and words he may finde that, which he doeth profitably geue vs: and may cauſe thoſe things to procéed from vs, which may be acceptable to God, and profitable to men.</p>
