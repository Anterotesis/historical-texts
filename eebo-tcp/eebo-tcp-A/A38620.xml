            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>MAN</hi> naturally becomes his own Flatterer, and being ſenſible that all other Animals are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, either by his Wit or Strength, eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enclines to deſpiſe
<pb facs="tcp:61588:3"/>
thoſe Beings as infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, and arrogates to himſelf the Empire of this ſmall ſpot of Earth.</p>
            <p>And though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly put in mind of his Defects, by the Weakneſs and Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowneſs of his Senſes, and conſequently of his Underſtanding, by the irregularity of his
<pb facs="tcp:61588:3"/>
Inclinations, the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order of his Paſſions, and innumerable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences to which he is ſubject, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, aſſuming a falſe Bravery he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects to ſeem above theſe Things, and to appear ſelf-ſufficient.</p>
            <p>With the counterfeit Wings of immaginary
<pb facs="tcp:61588:4"/>
Virtue, he ſoars to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heaven, and pretends to partake of the Divine Nature; notwithſtanding that the Spring and firſt Motion, even of the beſt of his Actions, as the ſubſequent Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe fully proves, is nothing but Pride, Self-love, and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:61588:4"/>
Wherefore, with all due Gratitude, 'tis fit to acknowledge the Grace and Favour, whereby Almighty Providence has been pleaſed to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate thoſe Precepts and Commands which alone lead to Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Perfection, which are ſo admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably expreſſed in the
<pb facs="tcp:61588:5"/>
Great Example of that Divine Perſon, who came both to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct, and to Save, Mankind.</p>

            <p>AMong all the Works of God, there is not any one Greater, or more worthy Admiration, then Man himſelf. For when we enumerate his different Qualities and Perfections, it ſeems that the Skill and Art of Divine Providence, that ſports it ſelf in the world, would epitomize it ſelf in him; and that to ſhew the choiceſt of its Invention, it has been pleaſed to form a Creature from a mixture and aſſemblage of what ever was
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61588:9"/>
extraordinary in all other Creatures. So that if we conſider the principal parts that compoſe him, we cannot ſufficiently ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire that ſecret and moſt inward Union which we perceive in him of two Natures ſo oppoſite one to another; and yet at the ſame time we cannot conceive, how that Terreſtial and Corporeal matter, which is ſo incapable to obey the orders of Reaſon, ſhould ſo perſpicuouſly apprehend, and ſo readily execute her Commands in Man.</p>
            <p>But all theſe particular advantages are inferior to his Birth; wherein God, as I may ſo ſay, has Crown'd him with his own hands, and has given him an abſolute Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire over all other Creatures, wholly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected under his Dominion. In a word, the Heavens rowl about for his ſake,</p>
            <q>
               <l>The Air, the Land and Seas</l>
               <l>Strive all to pleaſe,</l>
               <l>Contending which for Splendour, not for N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed,</l>
               <l>With choiceſt Viands ſhall his Table ſpread.</l>
            </q>
            <p>To this ſame Royal Supremacy God has alſo added another much more conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61588:9"/>
and more excellent. For he has made Man the Arbiter of his own Deſtiny, the Lord and Soveraign of all his Actions; ſo that, whereas all other Creatures move blindly to their Ends, and have their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations determin'd, Man performs all his Actions with knowledg, and by his own proper election, diſpoſing of himſelf. Which illuſtrious prerogative raiſes him to that degree, that it likens him to God, and gives him a ſhare of that Providence with which God governs the World. Nor can we deny, but that this is one of the moſt exalted, and the moſt ſublime of all his Privileges: Yet on the other ſide, we are oblig'd to acknowledg, that it may alſo prove fatal to him, and may be the cauſe as well of his Ruin as his Felicity. For Man being ſo near to himſelf, and ſo remote from Soveraign Good, it is much more eaſie for him to ſeek his Happineſs in Himſelf, and to enjoy a Benefit that is ſo near at hand, and to which his Heart is naturally inclin'd, then to raiſe himſelf to the poſſeſſion of God, from whom he is ſeparated by ſuch immenſity of ſpace. Beſides, his Mind is cover'd with a veil of Sence, which is the reaſon that oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61588:10"/>
he looſes the proſpect of real Good, and miſtakes Pleaſure, Wealth, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, which are but the Shadows of real Felicity, for the Thing it ſelf.</p>
            <p>At this time of imminent danger, <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> offers her ſelf, ſteddily to direct his footſteps, to ſhew him the only Mark at which he ought to aim, and the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject where he can only meet with repoſe, and the accompliſhment of all his wiſhes. This important function, which is only proper to <hi>Prudence,</hi> is ſufficient to advance it infinitely above all other Vertues, and makes it ſeem to us as the very Eye of the Soul. For tho all the Vertues are highly valuable in nature, excellent in their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and admirable in the variety of their offices; yet muſt we all agree, that they would every one be blind, wandring and uncertain, were not <hi>Prudence</hi> their Guide; did ſhe not diſcover the true End which they ought to propoſe to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and mark out the way which can only lead 'em to it.</p>
            <p>To ſay truth, <hi>Prudence</hi> is as it were a foreign Underſtanding, that fortifies and brings to perfection the natural Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of Man; 'tis to her that all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61588:10"/>
men are beholding for the wiſdom of their Conduct; all well order'd Families, and all well regulated Cities, for their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy. 'Tis ſhe that ſitting in the Soul of Kings as in her Throne, preſides in all their Councils, and pronounces thoſe Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles that cauſe the Glory and the Felicity of Kingdoms. Laſtly, it is ſhe that ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging abroad in their Armies, renders the moſt ſavage and impetuous Diſpoſitions capable of Diſcipline, eſtabliſhes Order in the room of Confuſion, and teaches Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour the ſecret of being attended with Victory.</p>
            <p>Theſe wonderful and innumerable ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of <hi>Prudence,</hi> have gain'd her thoſe great Encomiums which the Hiſtorians, Poets, and Philoſophers give her, and have caus'd her to be reverenc'd by the wiſe Men in all Ages as a Deity. Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that as the <hi>Perſians</hi> adore the Sun, becauſe it appears to Sence to be the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Creator and Cheriſher of all that grows in Nature; ſo the wiſe Men have attributed to <hi>Prudence</hi> a kind of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious worſhip, as ſeeming to them to be the viſible Cauſe of all the happy Events of Human Life. <q>'Tis our Ignorance, ſays
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61588:11"/>
a certain Poet, which makes us imagine, that blind Chance governs all Human Affairs. 'Tis our miſtake, ô Fortune, that has plac'd Thee in Heaven, which has made us believe, that thy capricious Decrees regulate our Actions:</q>
            </p>
            <q>

               <l>From that ſame Breaſt can abſent be.</l>
            </q>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Prudence</hi> deprives thee of thy Power, and deſtroys thee of thy Divinity; 'tis ſhe alone that has the power to make us happy; and her Laws alone, obſerv'd or violated, are the cauſes of our Good or Evil Deſtiny.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Nothing ſo clearly ſhews us the ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous vanity of men, as that ſame plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure which they take to be undeceiv'd from popular Opinions; and yet at the ſame time they are undeceiv'd, to deceive themſelves after another manner. For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly 'tis a great abſurdity, to refer all Events to a Cauſe ſo irregular and blind as Fortune. But on the other ſide, it is as great an error to look upon <hi>Prudence</hi> as the inſallible ſource of our Happineſs, and the proſperity of Families, Common-wealths,

               </gap>, That the good Opinion which Men have of <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> is ill grounded, we need no more then to examin the Nature of Men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prejudice, and conſider that it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways full of diſtruſt, timorouſneſs, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty; which proceeds from the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity and inconſtancy of the matter. For ſhe has to do with Men, whoſe Hearts are impenetrable, and who are continually ſubject to change, thro the lightneſs of their humour, thro the ſucceſſion of their paſſions, and the diverſity of their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts. So that as <hi>Heraclitus</hi> aſſur'd us, that he could have no natural Knowledg, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Object of the Sciences ought to be conſtant, but that Nature was in a perpetual motion, ſtill gliding along like a ſtream, where we can never conſider the water, becauſe it paſſes away before we can well look upon it; ſo we may affirm in like manner, that <hi>Prudence</hi> can aſſure her ſelf of nothing; ſeeing that Man is never in the ſame poſture, but varies in his Diſpoſition and Affections thro an infinite number of Cauſes both internal and external.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:61588:12"/>
I admire with the reſt of the world, the ways that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> has diſcover'd to facilitate perſwaſion by rouſing the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are predominant in men. In a word, it frequently happens, that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions will move the moſt inhuman and cruel to Pity and Compaſſion; that with Menaces we force the Timorous to yeild; and that with Money we obtain our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires from perſons unintereſſed. But I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee, how <hi>Prudence</hi> can ſafely make uſe of theſe, no more then upon the Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice of one in whom deſire of Revenge upon his Enemy may be more powerful, at the very time that I promiſe my ſelf to corrupt him with the offer of a large Sum.</p>
            <p>But a Perſon of vaſt Natural parts, who is of great experience, and who is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways Learned, and compleatly read in Hiſtory, Shall not he act with ſecurity? Yes; if he meet with ſubjects and occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons altogether like to thoſe which he has ſeen or obſerv'd in Hiſtory. But it is as rarely poſſible to meet with this Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance as to find out two Men of the ſame Complexion and Features. 'Tis no true Conſequence in Phyſic, that a Medicine
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61588:12"/>
that has been given with ſucceſs to that Choleric perſon will cure another. <hi>For Choler,</hi> ſays <hi>Galen, is not only different from all other Humours, but varies alſo from it ſelf.</hi> And this difficulty to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſubjects and occaſions altogether alike, is the reaſon that <hi>Prudence</hi> and Phyſic are much indebted to Hazard; and that Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Men and wiſe and wary Phyſitians proceed with ſo much caution, and take ſo much care before they determine. How did uncertainties fill the Soul of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> with reſtleſs trouble and inquietude, the Night before the Battel of <hi>Arbela?</hi> So that we cannot imagine a greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion at Sea between contending Surges and mountainous Billows, when agitated by tempeſtuous Winds, then in the Breaſt and Soul of <hi>Alexander,</hi> where ſo many various thoughts and paſſions at that time ſtrugled together.</p>
            <p>It is clear then, that <hi>Human Prudence</hi> is erroneous and uncertain, and that there is no ſecure reliance upon it for any true ſucceſs or proſperity. But it is not enough to have ſhewn, that it is unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitable, we muſt alſo prove it to be hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Which is a Truth we may be eaſily
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61588:13"/>
convinc'd of, after we have freed our ſelves of all manner of prejudice; if then we do but examine, whether <hi>Prudence</hi> does not frequently do much miſchief, with her circumſpection, her ſcruples, and her cautions. How many has ſhe not perplex'd? How many grand Affairs has ſhe not caus'd to miſcarry? How many Families has ſhe not undone? How many great Fortunes have been made; how many Treaties have been advantageouſly concluded; how many Victories won, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Rules of <hi>Prudence?</hi> The Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel which <hi>Alexander</hi> won, not far from the Banks of <hi>Granicus,</hi> which made way for all his ſucceeding Renown, was it not lookt upon by the <hi>Romans</hi> as a piece of Raſhneſs, that deſerv'd to be ſeverely puniſh'd? And that River which, as I may ſo ſay, was the Cradle of his Glory, might it not as well have prov'd his Tomb? It is impoſſible for us to have other perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions then theſe, when we remember, that the Enterprize of <hi>Lucullus</hi> againſt <hi>Tigranes</hi> attended with Victory and the Defeat of an hundred thouſand men, was neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs both cenſur'd and blam'd at <hi>Rome;</hi> when we remember, I ſay, that the Equity
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61588:13"/>
of that grave and judicious People did not think it a thing fit to applaud the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Temerity of the General of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, becauſe it had proſper'd; nor to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove a Succeſs that had advanc'd the Glory of the Empire, ſince it was from a Cauſe that might have been its Ruin. If you would ſee an Example of a Battel loſt thro the Councels of Military <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> and after all the care imaginable taken to ſecure the Victory, caſt but an eye upon the Battel of <hi>Poitiers,</hi> and there behold King <hi>John</hi> inexorable, and haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily refuſing to the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> the Peace which he ſought with ſo much ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs, and upon Conditions ſo advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous; Doubtleſs, the Aſſurances which the King then had of Victory, were both probable and rational: For he found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at the Head of four and fifty thouſand Men, accompanied with his four Sons, the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> his Brother, two <hi>Marſhals</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> five and twenty Dukes, Counts, and Great Lords, and all the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of <hi>France;</hi> yet notwithſtanding all this Force, he was defeated and taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner by the Prince; ſo weak at that time that he had ſcarce Ten thouſand fighting
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61588:14"/>
men in the Field, and thoſe ſo ill provided with Victuals, that they had but for one day a ſcant remainder left; and ſo far advanced into the heart of the Kingdom, that to all outward appearance it was impoſſible for him to retreat. The Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels thus gain'd and loſt contrary to all probable Expectation afford us frequent occaſions to obſerve, that there is not in that ſame judgment which men make of Human Actions, a merit and ſolidity ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to weigh down the Ballance; but that it is only their Succeſs that has the power to advance their Fame. In a word, a Great Perſonage in their Opinion, is not He who is endued with all the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of ſuch an one, tho he perform upon all occaſions what ever becomes a Great Perſon; but they delay to form their judgments till Fortune has declar'd her ſelf. And then it is, that they debaſe a Wiſe and Valiant Captain below the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar ſort, and extol a Succeſsful Raſh Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander for an Illuſtrious General.</p>
            <p>But this is that which deſerves our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, that after all the Earth has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſounded with the noiſe of the Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Famous Captains, and that all

            <p>The loſs of the Battel of <hi>Pharſalia</hi> is a convincing proof of the Truth of this. <hi>Pompey</hi> had beaten <hi>Caeſar</hi> at <hi>Dyrrachum;</hi> he had two great Armies in the Field; his Navy ſo ſtrong, that it was ſuppoſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible.

            <p>On the other ſide, all the Cities ſhut their Gates againſt <hi>Caeſar;</hi> he was reduced to that neceſſity, and in that dire want of Proviſions, that he was forc'd to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodge his Camp every day to find Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als for his Men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:61588:15"/>
               <hi>Pompey's</hi> Army was encouraged by their Number, and the Grandeur of their Party. For all the Senators, all that were Illuſtrious by Deſcent, famous for their Merit, or conſiderable for their Power, had ſided with <hi>Pompey.</hi> Inſomuch, that <hi>Rome</hi> ſeem'd to be remov'd to the Plains of <hi>Pharſalia,</hi> and <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Pavillion lookt like the Senate-Houſe. More then all this, the Kings and Princes in Alliance with the <hi>Romans</hi> had all taken his part, <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> ſo abandon'd, that the Commanders and Officers of the Army which he brought out of <hi>Spain,</hi> daily deſerted him. Laſtly, <hi>Pompey</hi> ſeem'd to be animated by the Juſtice of his Cauſe, which encourag'd him to hope for the Protection of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; beſides, that he had the Prayers and good wiſhes of all the People. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, <hi>Caeſar</hi> was the object of the Curſes and Hatred of all the World, as being lookt upon as the odious Oppreſſor of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Liberty. However, notwithſtanding all theſe Advantages <hi>Pompey</hi> loſt the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, and that after ſuch an ignominious manner, that when we compare what he did, to what he ought to have done, to what other great Captains do, and to what
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61588:16"/>
himſelf had done, we hardly know him again, but are forc'd to ſeek in <hi>Pompey</hi> for <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great. For had he been the Great <hi>Pompey,</hi> Would he have taken a Fright at the very firſt Diſorder of his Army? Would he have deſpair'd as ſoon as ever he ſaw his Cavalry give ground? Or inſtead of putting a ſtop (with his Sword in his hand) to thoſe that fled, as <hi>Caeſar</hi> did at the Battel of <hi>Dyrrachum,</hi> Would he have retir'd to his Tent, and ſate down there, without ſpeaking ſo much as one word, as if he had been immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, aſtoniſh'd, and Tunder-ſtruck? Why did we not behold him in the midſt of his Troops, like <hi>Alexander</hi> at the Battel of <hi>Arbela,</hi> when the Chariots of <hi>Darius,</hi> arm'd with Sythes, had broken and much endammag'd his Cavalry, encouraging his Captains and Soldiers, rallying their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order'd Ranks, returning firſt himſelf to the Charge, renewing the Fight by his Words and his Example too, and doing the Duty as well of a private Soldier as of a Commander? Why did he not fight on to the laſt, and receive whole flights of Arrows thro his Breaſt, like <hi>Epaminon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> at the Battel of <hi>Mantinea,</hi> that if Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61588:16"/>
could not overcome and force his Deſtiny, it might at leaſt have ſerv'd him to ſave his Honour. Doubtleſs he would not have fail'd in any of theſe Attempts; nay, he would have acted magnanimouſly in every one, had he been ſtill himſelf. But he was no more the ſame Great <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey,</hi> who at the Age of Four and twenty years Vanquiſh'd <hi>Domitius,</hi> with the Slaughter of twenty thouſand of his men; and who in forty days reconquer'd <hi>Africa.</hi> This is no longer that Captain under whoſe Conduct the <hi>Roman Arms</hi> had been Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious during ſo long a ſeries of Years; and who, by the incredible number of his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements, had extended the Limits of the Empire, in <hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>Europe,</hi> as far as the Ocean; and in <hi>Aſia,</hi> to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces lying upon the <hi>Hyrcanean</hi> and <hi>Red Sea.</hi> This is a Perſon heartleſs, without judgment, careleſs of Glory; a ſlothful Spectator, and ignominious of the Ruin of his own Army; who when he ſaw the Victor enter his Camp, quitted his very Armour, and ſhifting himſelf into a Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit agreeable to his bad Fortune, betook himſelf to his Heels.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:61588:17"/>
True it is, that <hi>Caeſar</hi> blam'd <hi>Pompey</hi> for commanding his formoſt Ranks to ſtay and receive the firſt Charge of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miés; and attributed to that part of <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y's</hi> Orders the Loſs of the Battel. For, ſays he, a Great Captain ought never to deprive himſelf of the Advantages of the firſt Attacks, which are uſually moſt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement and vigorous.</p>
            <p>But the Juſtice of this Accuſation does not ſo clearly appear: For if it be ſuch an advantage to Aſſail the formoſt Ranks, as <hi>Caeſar</hi> alledges, it may be deem'd as well no leſs a piece of Policy to ward off the firſt Blows, and then to fall in upon the Enemy, when their firſt fury is almoſt ſpent. He alſo cenſures <hi>Pompey</hi> for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other overſights, thro that Ignorance of his, which only acknowledg'd Human Cauſes to be the Cauſes of Human Events.</p>
            <p>But the ſudden change of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Fortunes, raiſes our Contemplations much higher, and inſtructs us more ſublimely, That that ſame Dread which ſeiz'd his Heart, where Fear never enter'd before, was a Divine Terror, a ſtroke from the Hand of the moſt Omnipotent, who fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſmites in this manner, to teach
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61588:17"/>
Great Captains, and Admirers of their At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements, that Proſperity and their Victories are only the Effects of thoſe Councels and that Courage which He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires into their Breaſts; and that He, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the ſole diſpoſal of their Hearts in his Hands, bereaves 'em of their Strength and Reſolution when he pleaſes; and when it is his pleaſure to ruin and deliver them into their Enemy's hands, he has no more to do, but to withdraw his Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; and then the Valour, the Puiſſance, and the Induſtry of Men drop to the ground of themſelves, as having loſt their only ſupport. <hi>There is no King,</hi> ſays the Oracle of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>who is ſav'd by the multitude of an Hoſt. A mighty Man is not delivered by his Strength.</hi> And that ſame Manag'd Horſe, in which a Warriour puts his Confidence, after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny trials of Courage, and being preſerv'd by the Generous Breaſt, ſhall fail him at laſt in his moſt preſſing Neceſſities. If then the diſcouragement which frequently happens to the moſt famous Captains, be an evident Demonſtration that God is the Arbiter and ſoveraign Diſpoſer of the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in War, the confuſion and ſudden ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſe
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61588:18"/>
of their tranſcending parts, is a much more palpable proof. For we find, that in the midſt of all thoſe means that are in their power to reeſtabliſh their Affairs, they have neither the Wit nor the Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to make uſe of any one. Which blindneſs and overſight was apparent thro the whole Conduct of <hi>Pompey:</hi> For when he might have ruin'd <hi>Caeſar</hi> without the hazard of a Battel, and when he had at command ſo many means to prevent his own loſs, or to have recover'd and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair'd the loſs ſuſtain'd, he had not the underſtanding to make uſe of any one.</p>
            <p>
               <q>God is terrible, ſays the Sacred Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, chiefly to the Kings of the Earth; whenever he pleaſes, he deprives them of their Underſtanding, and then they dream of making themſelves formidable by the Puiſſance of their Arms, by the Number of their Chariots, by the Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence and Grandeur of their Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page; but he that ſits in Heaven, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides their Projects, makes Himſelf more formidable then they, and with a Word of his Indignation, daſhes 'em to pieces, like Pots of Clay.</q>

Behold the Conduct which God ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd in reſpect of <hi>Darius.</hi> This haughty Monarch was fully perſwaded, that the innumerable Number of his People, the immenſe Riches which the Conjunction of two Empires furniſh'd him withall, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd his Puiſſance invincible. He lookt upon <hi>Alexander</hi> as a raſh and inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate young man, a kind of Knight Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture; and he had commanded his Guards to fetch him to Court both Fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd and Manacl'd. Nor did the Loſs of the Battel of <hi>Iſſus</hi> diminiſh his Pride, nor had as yet made him change his Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; chuſing rather to impute his Loſs to his own Miſtake, for Aſſailing the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in the narrow Paſſages of the <hi>Cilician</hi> Mountains, then to <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Valour; and aſſur'd himſelf of Victory, could he but draw the <hi>Grecians</hi> down into the Plain. But he had no ſooner cover'd the Plains of <hi>Arbela</hi> with his Army of eight hundred thouſand Men, when <hi>Alexander,</hi> whom God made uſe of to humble the Pride of that preſumptuous Monarch, utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated his numerous Hoſt with a handful of Men, ſlew a hundred thouſand of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and totally ruin'd in one day
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61588:19"/>
the moſt flouriſhing Empire in the World.</p>
            <p>This Example alone may ſuffice to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince Mankind, that the Advantages of Encamping, the ranging of Battalia's, the Multitude and Reſolution of the Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and the Experience of the Generals, are not the only ſecure means for obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Victory; of which God alone is the ſole Diſpoſer; and who having at his own command the two contending Parties, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers up the one into the hands of the other, as he pleaſes himſelf. <q>Leaſt the Victors, ſaith the Lord, ſhould be ſo blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by their own vanity, to attribute to the Strength of their own Arms; and not to Me, the gaining of Conqueſt; and leſt they ſhould fondly believe, that when they have vanquiſh'd their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, it was ſome other Power then the Strength of my Sword, that threw 'em to the Ground, or other then my Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors that diſcourag'd their Hearts. I give that Confidence to one ſingle Man to purſue a Thouſand, and ſo two or three to put ten Thouſand to flight.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Name of the <hi>Lord of Hoſts,</hi> which God ſo frequently aſſumes to himſelf in Holy Scripture, wonderfully confirms all
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61588:19"/>
this to be a Truth. For ſince we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not without Impiety believe, that he takes upon him any Name unjuſtly or unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly, it behoves us to be ſtrongly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that while he declares himſelf the <hi>Lord of Hosts,</hi> He it is that is the Author of Victory to whom he pleaſes, and that he regulates the Succeſſes of War according to the Laws of his Juſtice and Wiſdom. So that however men may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute all Events in War, both extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and ſurprizing, to Chance and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, which they look upon as the blind Cauſe of all accidents both ſudden and unexpected; yet both the one and the other are falſe judgments which the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes of men has brought forth; thoſe Adventures ſeeming ſtrange and odd, in regard of our Ignorance, not in reſpect of Gods Providence, which governs all thoſe Events and baniſhes all manner of hazard from the World. I ſhall conclude with the words of the learned <hi>Boetius,</hi> That the Care of Providence is ſo wiſe and univerſal, that it leaves nothing to the raſh Power of Fortune.</p>

            <p>The real Cauſe of that Eſteem which

            <p>It is not ſo with a perſon of Sincerity. We give him that title ſo long as we find him to be cordial and open-hearted, and that we may depend upon his word, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not in his power to diſguiſe his thoughts. But when we have ſounded him
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61588:21"/>
and perceive that he makes uſe of his Sincerity as a Veil to cover his Deſigns, and that his frankneſs is only a means to obtain his ends, our Idea's of the ſame perſon are then quite different.</p>
            <p>But what are the ends, or what the proſpect of a Sincere man. The firſt is to oblige his Friends, and all thoſe with whom he has any familiarity or dealing, to diſcourſe ſincerely with him, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal nothing from him, to the end he may underſtand the truth of their ſentiments, their inclinations, and their affairs; as alſo to know the truth of what paſſes abroad, as accidents and ſtories the moſt ſecret and moſt full of curioſity; ſo that Curioſity is here the principal Cauſe of his Sincerity. Now in regard that this was the ſecond Paſſion that ſprung up in the heart of man, and that it ſucceeded next to that of inordinate Self-love, and had a conſiderable hare in his fall, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs this paſſion cannot but be extreamly violent; and tho her violence be unknown becauſe not obvious to the ſence, yet is it eaſie to perceive it by that eager de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire which hurries us to gadd after Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Shews, and new Acquaintance; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61588:21"/>
where we hear of Wit and Beauty, or any thing of extraordinary parts. Let us apply this to our purpoſe, and let us ſay, that we may diſcover Curioſity to be a violent Paſſion, by our violent liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning after public and private News, and by the pleaſure which we take in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; which is ſo great, that it is the moſt delightful employment of our Lives; inſomuch, that this pleaſure ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ms to be not only the divertiſement, but the very nouriſhment of our thoughts; for we grow melancholy when we are in places bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren of Tales and Stories, or if being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd into the Country our Friends in Town or at Court are negligent or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getful to ſend us the weekly occurrences. We need not wonder then, if men that now adays live ſuch a Life of Paſſion, labour with ſo much earneſtneſs to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie a Paſſion ſo lively and vehement as Curioſity; and that there are ſo many who make uſe of Sincerity as a Bait to allure their Friends to open their Hearts, and truſt 'em with what is moſt proper for their ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>We ſhall better apprehend, that there are ſeveral perſons that are Sincere out
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61588:22"/>
of a reſpect to themſelves, and to feed their Curioſity, when we conſider, that moſt parts of Friendſhips are deceitful, and that the frequent ruptures (proceeding from the cold correſpondencies which perſons frank and open-hearted find in their Friends) ariſe from hence, that they did not receive that Benefit from their Amity which they expected. I mean, that we are not abſolutely offended that the Sincerity of our Friends is not equal to ours, but that their want of Sincerity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives us of the knowledg of their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, their Deſigns, and their private Intelligences.</p>
            <p>The ſecond pretence to Sincerity is upon this account, that men may tell 'em the Truth; which they deſire not ſo much out of a Love of Truth, or any averſion to error or falſhood, but fearing the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy of being Deceiv'd. For man at his firſt Creation reverenc'd Truth of that reſpect which he bore to God, and that he might live under Divine direction; and avoiding Error that lead him aſtray. But now he admires Truth for another reaſon, becauſe it is an ornament to his mind, and ſutable to his excellence above
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61588:22"/>
other Creatures, and hates Error and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion only becauſe they are ignominious. Now we are ſenſible of this ſhame, when believing that we have for a long time enjoy'd the friendſhip and confidence of ſuch and ſuch perſons, we at length come to diſcover that we are abus'd, that they have all along diſguis'd their Friendſhip, and conceal'd from us their moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant affairs.</p>
            <p>In the third place men of Sincerity pretend to remove from themſelves all ſuſpition of double dealing and knavery. For in regard they find, that Knavery ruins irreparably their Reputation, they conceive an extraordinary averſion to it, and look upon Sincerity as a Vertue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to make 'em eſteem'd, and to fix 'em upon the Baſis of true Honeſty. They alſo hope to acquire the good will of all the world, by their frankneſs of proceeding, and by the ſincerity of their words. Nor are they deceiv'd, for upon the ſame ſcore that they ſhun Falſhood and Diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they love and ſeek after perſons of Sincerity; they alſo deſire their prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and gladly ſerve 'em upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions. For this is one thing which men
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61588:23"/>
of Sincerity aim at; as not being ſatisfied that their Sincerity begets them the eſteem and friendſhip of men, unleſs they may be alſo ſerviceable to 'em in their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular affairs.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, we make a profeſſion of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity to the end that others may have a firm belief in us, and may give credit to our words. For nothing flatters our Vanity ſo much, as that Authority which our Words have acquir'd thro the good opinion which men have of our Sincerity. So that it is the principal endeavour men of Sincerity propoſe that are unbyaſs'd. And when they are nicely Ambitious, 'tis their only aim.</p>
            <p>We find at Court, even amongſt thoſe who are moſt addicted to Intrigue, ſeveral that counterfit a ſincere aſpect, which they ſtrive to make appear as natural as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly they can, accommodating likewiſe to the ſincerity of their Looks the tone of their Voice and geſture of their Body. They affect a free and open Countenance, and a genuine Behaviour, to gain Credit among thoſe with whom they have to deal. This ſort of formal Sincerity we find in Chief Miniſters of State, in Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61588:23"/>
in men of Buſineſs, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in public Perſons. And ſo long as they are dextrous at it, it ſerves 'em to conceal their Deſigns, and is the reaſon that men believe and put a confidence in them; and it ſets them at liberty to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their Inclinations and their Intereſts contrary to their Oaths and Engagements, out of confidence that whatever they do will be always well interpreted.</p>
            <p>There is one ſort of Sincerity that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the force of Self-love. This we meet with in perſons downright and of mean capacities, who upon all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons diſplay the reality of their thoughts, not having the power nor the addreſs to conceal them. So that whereas men of parts ſo ſpeak and behave themſelves, that they ſeem not to value their own Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts; theſe perſons who enjoy nothing but what is natural, preſently diſcloſe the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt that opens their Lips and ſets 'em at work, in regard the violence of their Self-love diſcovers and betrays 'em.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe ſorts of Sincerity, there is one ſort more that follows the temper of the Body, which may be term'd Natural Sincerity. <q>For there are Vertues of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61588:24"/>
Temperament (ſays <hi>Ariſtotle),</hi> that is, Diſpoſitions and Inclinations to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe certain Vertues.</q> For as there are ſome perſons born Couragious, others Chaſt, ſo there are others naturally Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, and ſuch as put a real force upon themſelves when they are conſtrain'd to diſſemble. There are others altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther oppoſite to theſe, who can never away with frank and free diſcourſe, but take a peculiar delight in practiſing Diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation. This kind of Diſpoſition have I obſerv'd in ſeveral Perſons, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in ſome Women, who tho very Loyal to their Husbands, yet were not at all Sincere to them.</p>
            <p>Sincerity then is an opening of the Heart, or a politic frankneſs that ſerves us to gain the eſteem and friendſhip of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt men; or a fear to be accounted a Cheat; or a natural inclination to ſpeak what a man thinks; or a nice ambition that men ſhould ſet an implicite value upon our words. Among the counterfit Sincere, Sincerity is a refin'd piece of Knavery, and in them the ſincere aſpect is the leaſt ſincere.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:61588:24"/>
But Chriſtian and vertuous Sincerity is not the effect of any Intereſt or Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, not ſo much as of that Paſſion to be thought Sincere, and they that practiſe it pretend to aim at nothing more then Obedience to God, who forbids Diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and double dealing; but to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold union and a good correſpondence among Men.</p>

            </head>
            <p>FRiendſhip is a rational Inclination, which abides in the perſon that gave it Birth. 'Tis the original of all the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs that is to be taſted in Life. <hi>Who can think Life it ſelf alive,</hi> ſaid the ancient Poet <hi>Ennius, without the ſweet enjoyment of Friendſhip?</hi> 
               <q>Who can live without Friends, ſays <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> tho he enjoy'd all other Felicities?</q> 
               <q>If ſome Deity, ſays <hi>Cicero,</hi> ſhould place us in a ſolitude, the moſt delightful and abounding in plenty, upon this hard condition, that we ſhould have no Communication with any perſon whatſoever, would it not be impoſſible to lead a Life ſo ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and weariſome?</q> which proceeds from hence, that Man having an invincible inclination to expand himſelf beyond the bounds of any Confinement, becomes a troubte and burthen to himſelf when he
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:61588:25"/>
cannot gratifie his paſſions by imparting them to others. Now in a Deſert he would be depriv'd of that Conſolation; nay he could not reap that benefit by So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety it ſelf; even they who live together in the ſame place, would live as it were in a Deſert in the midſt of Company, if their Hearts were not united, or that there were not an Internal tye and aſſociation one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong another; which is the reaſon that Friendſhip, which cauſes the union of Hearts, is ſo highly valued and ſought for by all the World.</p>
            <p>But this high price of Friendſhip, do's not conſiſt in the ſole delight, in a ſtrict and ſettl'd Correſpondence between two Friends. <q>There is yet a higher value to be ſet upon it, ſays <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> becauſe it is extreamly beneficial. For it is profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſays he, to all Ages and all Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. To Princes and Great Men, it is ſerviceable in the diſcharge of that Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, which chiefly belongs to their Quality, and to ſhare ſome part of their wealth to thoſe whom they honour with their Favour. She aſſiſts with her pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Counſels thoſe that are in Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and teaches 'em that great Secret

            </p>
            <p>Neither does Friendſhip confine her ſelf to the profit and advantage of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons; ſhe aſſumes to her ſelf the eſtabliſhing and raiſing of whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, and prides her ſelf in being the ſource and original of the Grandeur and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>elicity of Empires. For which reaſon the moſt prudent Legiſlators, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> has obſerv'd, have taken more particular care to inſtruct their people how to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve perpetual Friendſhip one among another, then to enact ſevere Laws to prevent the violation of Juſtice. For they ſaw well, than Friendſhip might ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount Juſtice; but that it was very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable for Juſtice to overtop Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. In a word, whereever Concord
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:61588:26"/>
reigns (which is the general Friendſhip of Fellow-Citizens) there is no need to fear the puniſhments of Injury and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice; for Friends will never wrong one another, but rathermutually ſtudy each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers advantage. There is no need, I ſay, to fear that any Citizen will encroach upon his Neighbours Eſtate, which Friendſhip has made his own; or that he will wound their reputation that is common with his own. The Concord of Citizens one among another is a powerful tye, which will not ſuffer any Intereſt to make a diviſion; nor is the moſt rigorous Juſtice ſo ſure a tye for the upholding and preſerving of Order, as mutual Friendſhip.</p>
            <p>It is not ſo with Juſtice; which not having any predominance over the Heart of man, therefore cannot ſo diſpoſe it that it ſhall never deſire to do an Injury. Nay, tho its authority be never ſo great, it cannot puniſh the Crimes of all ſorts of People. For which reaſon <hi>Ana<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

of Men? Know'ſt not, that Laws are like the Spiders Web, that catch the Flies, which the Hornets quickly ſnap aſunder? Thus the Torments ordain'd for the puniſhment of Crimes, are for thoſe perſons that are miſerable and without ſupport, but the wealthy ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally eſcape the rigour of the Law.</q> Which is a Truth ſo well ſupported and confirm'd by all the reaſon and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the world, that we cannot ſufficiently applaud <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> where he ſays, <q>That Juſtice was introduced into Republics to ſupply and repair the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and failings of Friedſhip.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Let us now diſcourſe of the Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Friendſhip, and conſider how they are contrary to thoſe of Flattery. The latter treacherous, mean, and by aſs'd, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways creeps to Favour and Grandeur. The other Noble and Generous, loves the miſerable, and ſignalizes it ſelf in mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes. She is kind to perſons aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd, comforts and chears up the Heart oppreſst with cares and ſecret anguiſh. And we ſhould do her wrong not to place among the Vertues a Quality which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends and includes them all in one.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61588:27"/>
Nor muſt we forget, that it was ſhe who wrought thoſe Miracles which Antiquity has conſecrated to her Memory; that has fam'd <hi>Greece</hi> for perſons obſtinately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to dye one for another; and cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated <hi>Rome</hi> for Women abandoning their Lives that they might be inſeparably uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to their Husbands.</p>
            <p>We muſt acknowledge in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, that there can nothing be more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble then what men ſay, and what they think concerning Friendſhip; only we could wiſh that it were real. But what is too true on the other ſide is this, that all the motions of Nature are Circular; they who have narrowly obſerv'd the Actions of men, aſſure us, that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions of his Will are the ſame; and that he is ſo fix'd and devoted to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that every time he goes beyond him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to aſſiſt his Friends in their moſt preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing neceſſities, he returns to himſelf by ſome private way; And therefore, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever men believe or imagin, that he ſerves another to be ſerv'd himſelf; that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures the ſettlement of others, to ſecure his own, or at leaſt to reap the honour of his ſeveral Kindneſſes. "All ſorts of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:61588:28"/>
Friendſhip, ſays <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> are like ſo many Rivulets, that take their riſe from the Spring of Self-love. So that that ſame Friendſhip which ſeems to us moſt pure, is but the ſeeking of ſome advantages which we hope to obtain by that kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which we do to others. True it is, that it is a neat and dextrous way of ſeeking, and that of all the pretences of Self-love, that of Friendſhip is the moſt honeſt, and that which moſt genteelly covers its farther intentions. For among all the various Diſguiſes that man makes uſe of to ſucceed in the world, there is none ſo honourable, as when he ſtrives and labours to appear a zealous and faithful Friend. And therefore we need not wonder if it be chiefly at the Court, where affected Friendſhip expoſes it ſelf; that there ſhe erects her Theater, and puts on all her gawdy Habiliments; And laſtly, that there ſhe acts her Maſter-pieces, and recites her ſmootheſt and moſt affectionate parts; ſince it is there that they who take that courſe to attain their ends, make the greateſt advantages and obtain the higheſt preferments.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:61588:28"/>
But if there be no true Friendſhip, wherefore is it, that Miniſters of State and Favourites of Kings and Princes are ſo zealous to ſerve their abſent and diſgraced Friends? This Objection has taken deep root in the Breaſts of moſt Men, and it is ſo much the more neceſſary to be anſwer'd, becauſe the Reply will diſcover a kind of Miſtery. I ſay then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the good Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which for the abſent, and their dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to make their advantages of favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Conjunctures, are ſo far from being done out of pure kindneſs, that on the contrary they are the mee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> effects of Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts. A great Miniſter of State teſtifies his Zeal for his abſent Friend, and preſſes continually that he may be recalled home. 1. Becauſe his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nity he enjoys, that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter had loſt his Reputation, had he not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven his Friend that publick mark of his acknowledgment. 2. He does it for fear leſt the King ſhould have a bad Opinion of him, as having frequently thus conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with himſelf; What would the King think of me, ſhould I be ſilent, and do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for him, who ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> don ſo much for me? 3. He has a deſign that his Friend
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:61588:29"/>
ſhould be yet more united to his Intereſt. 4. He is afraid of his Enmity, ſhould he return, and he not be concerned in procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it. 5. He has this proſpect of the future, that ſo long as he had ſhewn him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf cordial to his Friend, he ſhould find the like that would beſtir themſelves in his behalf, ſhould it be his turn to fall into diſgrace. And this is a certain Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of what I aſſert, That a true craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Courtier is never zealous for his abſent Friends, but when he believes the King has ſtill ſome remaining tenderneſs for 'em, but he never troubles himſelf for thoſe that have utterly and irreparably loſt the good Opinion of the Prince, and are irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverably fall'n into his diſpleaſure. With this ſort of abſent Friends, they ſoon break off all manner of Correſpondence, and raze 'em from their remembrance, as if they never had been in the World, more miſerable then the dead, who leave behind 'em many times thoſe Friends that wiſh 'em alive again, that they might beſtow upon 'em Employments and Offices, which they have at their diſpoſal: Men being gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſo courteous, ſo human and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, that they are always ready to beſtow
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:61588:29"/>
their Favours upon thoſe that are not in a condition to accept of their Kindneſs.</p>
            <p>After all that has been ſaid, no Man will think it an irrational Aſtoniſhment, that ſo ſublime an Intellect, as that of <hi>Cicero,</hi> ſhould follow all the Vulgar Opinions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this ſubject of Friendſhip; and that of all the true Arguments that prove there is not any true and unbyaſs'd Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, not one ſhould be able to open his Eyes.</p>
            <p>
               <q>'Tis ſtrange, ſays <hi>Cicero,</hi> That ſeeing there are ſo many Millions of Men, all ſtrictly bound by the ſame tye of nature, we ſhall hardly throughout the whole extent of the Earth, find two real Friends.</q> But this can be no wonder to thoſe who apprehend that Man is a Priſoner to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and that ſelf-love is a kind of <hi>Waiter</hi> that attends him every time he ſtirs abroad, and brings him home again: For it is apparent, that Man being in ſuch a condition is not capable of Friendſhip; ſeeing that by the means of Friendſhip, he ought to enter into his Friend, and remain in the perſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whom he loves. <q>
                  <hi>'Tis a ſhame,</hi> ſays <hi>Cicero,</hi> That a Command, an Employment, Mony or Reputation,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:61588:30"/>
ſhould have the power to ruin the moſt friendly contracted Friendſhips, and that two Men ſo ſtrongly united and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited together, ſhould ſo eaſily become Rivals.</q> And indeed it is no way proper, that a Man who wiſhes his Friend as well or better then himſelf, ſhould be afflicted at the increaſe of his Wealth or Honour; nevertheleſs, it creates thoſe Jealouſies that rend his very Heart, and maugre all the violence which he uſes to himſelf, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in his Countenance. And therefore it is falſe, that he wiſhes his Friend thoſe advantages of Honour and Preferment, out of any ſentiment of ſincerity, as a votary for his Welfare. And this reaſon alone ſhould be enough to diſſipate that ſame darkneſs which blinds the World; force it to acknowledge, that Man is only amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of himſelf. <q>I cannot endure, ſays the ſame Author, That Men ſhould make love to grow from Buſineſs and Intereſt, and that they aſcribe ſo mean a birth to a quality ſo exalted; for what have I to do with <hi>Scipio,</hi> or wherein can I be ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to him?</q> I ſhall anſwer his Queſtion with another; For I would fain know, whether there be no more then one thing
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:61588:30"/>
of which a man ſtands in need, whether it be not as neceſſary for him to acquire Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, as to heap up Riches; and whether all things which he does not enjoy, and which are proper to ſatisfy his natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, are not ſo many Indigencies? But what are theſe wants and theſe inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts that deſtroy thoſe amities, which to us ſeem ſo ſincere? that we ſhall ſee in due place: in the mean time, <hi>Cicero</hi> muſt give us leave to aſſure him (with <hi>Plato,)</hi> That Friendſhip had its birth from <hi>Indigence.</hi>

            <p>To this we may add, That of all the Errors which <hi>Cicero</hi> has maintained upon this Subject, that is the abſurdeſt which undertakes to prove, That Freindſhip not only equals the Fortunes of Friends, by laying their Eſtates in common, but alſo le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels our Sentiments for them, with thoſe that we have for our ſelves. <q>Inſomuch, ſays he, That the Name of Friendſhip periſhes, if the Affection for our Freinds be not: as ſincere, as great, as ſtrong, and as ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as that which we bear to our ſelves: Whence it comes to paſs, that we call a Freind our <hi>Other Self,</hi> and that we ſay, that two Perſons link't together in
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:61588:31"/>
Friendſhip, have but one Heart and one Will.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>But whatever theſe Proverbs ſignifie, certain it is, ſays <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> That there is nothing comes near the Friendſhip which we have for our ſelves; and that it is both the beginning and the end of that which we have for others: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore where a Man ſhares his Eſtate with his Friend, where he ſurrenders to him the Employment which he enjoys, where he gives him all the Honour that they have acquired together, upon the ſame occaſion; when he retires and leaves to his Friend the entire Glory of an Illuſtrous Atchievement: all theſe Acts, ſays the Philoſopher, proceed from hence, that Man is ſtill firſt a Freind to himſelf. For he does all theſe things with a real intent, that they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to himſelf, ſince they all redound to his Satisfaction and his Honour.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But how comes it to paſs, that ſo many perſons believe they ſerve their Friends, out of pure and ſincere Love, and that they do not perceive, that they ſeek them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Services which they render 'em? I anſwer, That we do not perceive
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:61588:31"/>
what we do for our ſelves, in what we do for others, becauſe that the moſt part of the time, the motives that engage us to act, ly concealed in our Breaſts; and we rather chooſe to perſwade our ſelves, that we act generouſly and bravely, then to ſtudy the knowledge of our ſelves, or to inform our ſelves of our ſecret intentions. For ſhould we be taken up with theſe Cares, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently examine our own Hearts, they would ſoon diſcover the ſecret Springs that move us and govern our Actions, when we alſo be moſt regardleſs of Self-Intereſt, and would Demonſtrate to us, that there is nothing ſo profitable or delightful to us, or that flatters our oſtentation ſo much, as the very thing we ſeek for, when it ſeems to us, that we ſeek nothing at all.</p>
            <p>We muſt therefore acknowledge that <hi>Cicero</hi> had the true <hi>Idea</hi> of Friendſhip, and that he has given a moſt exact Definition of it, where he ſays, <hi>Than Friendſhip is the perfect <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of two vertuous Perſons; and That it is an Affection reciprocal, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, ſincere and unbyaſs'd:</hi> and we would willingly have ſubſcrib'd to his Opinion, if inſtead of ſaying, <hi>This is Friendſhip,</hi> he had ſaid, <hi>This is that which Friendſhip</hi>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:61588:32"/>
               <hi>ought to be.</hi> He alſo ſpoke much better then he thought he had, when he affirms Friendſhip to be a <hi>Divine Vertue,</hi> ſince it is no where to be found, but among men tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Divine; I mean among true Chriſtians. For the Freindſhip which they profeſs one to another, having its Original from God, who always acts ſincerely for the good of his Creatures, obliges 'em to procure the Advantages of their Friends, without any reſpect to themſelves.</p>
            <p>As for the Arguments he brings to prove, that Men are capable of a real Friendſhip, they are extreamly weak: But the moſt ſinewy is this. <q>We find, ſays he, That Vertue is amiable by our natural inclinations: For if a ſane Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution pleaſes us, if Riches and Honor have their allurements, how is it poſſible but that we ſhould be ſmitten with Beauty and charms of Vertue? She it is that gives Life to Freindſhip, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders her powerful and indiſſoluble; two vertuous perſons no ſooner caſt an Eye one upon another, but they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a reciprocal Affection, ſo that there is no other ground of their Amity but their Merit; and as for Profit and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:61588:32"/>
which have no ſhare in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, they are only the pleaſing fruits of the happy Conjunction.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This is a ſpecious Argument, and dazles thoſe that only ſlightly examine it. But they who more ſeriouſly pry into it, may eaſily diſcover the Falacy: For 'tis appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to all the World, that if there be no real Freindſhip, but what is founded upon Vertue, it is impoſſible that Vertue ſhould ſtand when the Foundation is demoliſhed, that is to ſay, if there be no ſincere Vertue, which is the work of this Treatiſe to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate.</p>
            <p>Add to this, that tho we ſhould ſuppoſe there were Vertues real and ſincere, yet would it not follow, that they were belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for themſelves, ſo long as it is ſo appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that no man tries Vertue, but only for his own intereſt; nor is it the uprightneſs of the Law which makes him love the juſt; but he has therefore a kindneſs for juſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, becauſe they offer no violence either to his Eſtate or Honour. Beſides that, we are to obſerve, That the moſt excellent Vertue, and moſt proper to beget Eſteem and Honour, for thoſe who enjoy thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:61588:33"/>
of endowment, more frequenly awaken our Jealouſie and our Envy.</p>
            <p>We ſhall ſee that <hi>Seneca</hi> is not much more to be admir'd then <hi>Cicero,</hi> when we hear him recount the wonders of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> ſays he, <hi>is ſo pure a thing, That neither the expectation of Wealth, nor ambition of Honour, nor proſpect of any ſort of Intereſt, contributes to its Birth. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then do we ſeek to make Friends? I would make Friends, to give 'em a ſhare of my Eſtate, to accompany 'em in Exile, to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer with 'em, the utmoſt rigour of their Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune: and I would make Friends to dye for 'em, if there were occaſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I would beg of thoſe that have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo little knowledge of the Heart of Man, if ever Friendſhip of this nature had beginning there, and whether it be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for a man to raiſe the Platform of ſuch a Friendſhip, for the ſake of which he would ardently deſire to deſpoil himſelf of his Eſtate, to ſacrifice his Life, and take upon himſelf the ponderous weight of another mans Calamities. In good earneſt, he muſt have a great tenderneſs for ſelf-deluſion, who admits ſuch a Dream or Viſion as this, for real Truth. And that which muſt
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:61588:33"/>
convince us, That there never was any ſuch Friendſhip in nature, but that it is only a <hi>Chimera</hi> reſiding in the <hi>Imagination;</hi> is this, That if we ſhould put the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to <hi>Seneca,</hi> where any Friends are to be found, and where not; he would anſwer, That they crowd in throngs after Perſons in Proſperity, but that there is not one to be ſeen near the Cells of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtrous.</p>
            <p>This ſame Truth, ſufficient of it ſelf to have defac'd in <hi>Seneca</hi>'s Thoughts, thoſe amiable <hi>Ideas</hi> of the Purity and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Friendſhip which he had fanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to himſelf, deſerves to be ſupported with ſome Examples. Among which, that of Queen <hi>Margaret</hi> is very Remarkable; She tells us, in her <hi>Memoirs,</hi> That being Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted in her Appartment, as they carried her croſs the Court of the <hi>Lovre;</hi> they, who the day before, thought themſelves happy, if ſhe but vouchſafed to caſt a look upon 'em, no ſooner perceived her, but they turned their backs upon her. And that which <hi>Strada</hi> relates of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth is no leſs Remarkable. He tells us how ſtrangely that Emperor was Aſtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, when entring into <hi>Spain,</hi> after he had
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:61588:34"/>
made an abſolute Reſignation of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and all his other Dominions, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, by the ſmall number of perſons of Quality that came to meet him, That how Glorious ſoever the Perſon of a Prince may ſeem, 'tis not that, but the flouriſhing Condition of their Fortune, which Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers adore. And then it was, ſaith the <hi>Hiſtorian,</hi> that <hi>Charles</hi> himſelf was deeply ſenſible, what it was to be a Prince, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either Sov'raignty or Title, and that he ſaw himſelf ſtripp'd like a naked Man.</p>
            <p>Thus we have ſeen the Errors of <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Seneca,</hi> touching Friendſhip; yet as abſurd as they were, they are not to be compar'd with thoſe of <hi>Montaigne;</hi> who, tho a perſon of ſo much Senſe and Solidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, has diſcours'd of Friendſhip like one in <hi>Delirium:</hi> And the reaſon why he has ſo groſsly miſtaken upon this Subject; is, the great Affection which he has for gay Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, lofty and extraordinary Fancies; eſpecially, when he finds in thoſe Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, that there is any thing that flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters him, and which makes for his Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. And hence it is, That after he has laugh'd at all thoſe Ties and Obligations
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:61588:34"/>
between ſeveral Perſons; to which, he ſays, men give ſo raſhly the name of Friendſhip, he maintains, That there are not only real Friendſhips, but ſuch Friendſhips where Men forget all thoughts of Service and Kindneſs for all others, but only the Party belov'd; where they ſo entirely abandon themſelves to their Affection, that they do not reſerve to themſelves, ſo much as the diſpoſal of their own Will: His words are theſe.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Among us men, there is not any foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps, of <hi>Friendſhip</hi> to be ſeen. All thoſe ſorts of <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> which Profit, Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, Publick or Private Buſineſs, have begot and cheriſhed, cannot be ſaid to be <hi>Friendſhips,</hi> in regard they intermix another End, another Cauſe and Benefit then themſelves. Perfect Amity is indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluble, every man ſurrenders himſelf up ſo entirely to his Friend, that there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains nothing for him to beſtow elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. He is perplexed that he has not ſeveral Souls and ſeveral Wills, that he might diſpoſe of all to his Friend. This <hi>Friendſhip</hi> poſſeſſes the Soul, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns her with an abſolute Soveraignty: this <hi>Friendſhip</hi> which muſt be only and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:61588:35"/>
ſingular, defaces all other Obligations. The Secret which I have ſworn not to diſcover to any other, I may without Perjury communicate to him, who is not another perſon, but my ſelf: My <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> with <hi>Stephen Boeotia,</hi> has no other <hi>Idea</hi> but it ſelf, and has only reference and relation to my ſelf. It hales and draggs away my Will to plunge and loſe it ſelf in the Will of my Friend, and then ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches his whole Will, it hales it back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to plunge and loſe it ſelf in mine, with an equal thirſt and concurrence. In this ſort of <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> every thing lyes common, Will, Thoughts, Wives, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Honors and Eſtate.</q> Then ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ſame place concerning <hi>Bloſius,</hi> the friend of <hi>Gracchus,</hi> who vow'd he would have fired the Temple, had his Friend deſired it; <q>They, ſays he, who condemn the words of <hi>Bloſius</hi> as Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, do not well underſtand the Miſtery of <hi>Friendſhip:</hi>
               </q> 
               <q>for they were greater Friends one to another, then to their fellow-Citizens, or to their Country.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Can there be imagined a ſtranger blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs then this, to confound Friendſhip with Love, and to aſcribe to a vertuous Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:61588:35"/>
the Injuſtices and Tranſportments of Paſſions the moſt violent? For then it is the part of Love to devote a man entirely to the perſon whom he loves, and to make him forget his Duty to God, his King, his Parents, and his Friends: for ſuch is the fury of this Paſſion that it tranſverſes Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, whoſe proper office it is, to mark out to every man, and oblige him to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of all his Duties. This is the Employment of Reaſon ſo long as ſhe raigns in the Body, and ſhe is no leſs care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to preſerve Man ſo ſteady, in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of Devoirs, that ſhe never ſuffers him to violate the leaſt particular; or that he ſhould be wanting in his performances to God, to acquit himſelf of his Affection to the beſt or moſt faithful of his Friends; tho he were beholding to him for his Life it ſelf. And therefore what <hi>Montaigne</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms: <hi>That Frieuſhip has a Priviledge to diſpenſe with all Laws, and to render us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocently Impious, Sacrilegious and Infidels;</hi> is equally contradictory, both to Reaſon and Religion, which is apparent from hence, that the <hi>Pagan Theoligie</hi> teaches no ſuch Doctrine, but rather the contrary, that we never ought to injure Piety, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:61588:36"/>
pretence of ſatisfying the ſtricteſt Obligations of Friendſhip.</p>
            <p>As for that other Aſſertion of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taigne, That the Secret which he has ſworn never to reveal to another, he may without Perjury communicate to his Freind, who is not</hi> another <hi>but</hi> himſelf: it needs no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, for what ſhall we ſay to a man, who by a childiſh piece of ſubtilty, and a pretty Equivocation, pretends to juſtify Perjury, and the violation of plighted Troth.</p>
            <p>Nor is it a leſs ſhame for that Author to extol to the Skies, thoſe <hi>Roman</hi> Ladies, who chuſe rather to kill themſelves and dye with their Husbands, then to ſurvive and follow 'em hereafter; more eſpecially the Wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e of the <hi>Conſul, Cecinna Poetus,</hi> who to reſcue her Husband from the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that were provided for him, and to encourage him to be his own Executioner after ſhe had Stabb'd her own Breaſt, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented him the Weapon, all bloody as it was, with theſe Words, <hi>Here</hi> Poetus, <hi>take it, it has done me no harm.</hi> I ſay it was not honourable in <hi>Montagne</hi> to attribute the effects of ambition to conjugal Friendſhip, as one that did not percieve, in the coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Reſolutions of <hi>Poetus</hi> and <hi>Seneca</hi>'s
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:61588:36"/>
Wives, to dye with their Husbands, that immoderate deſire of Praiſe wherewith the <hi>Romans</hi> were always inflamed: accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Character which <hi>Virgil</hi> has given of 'em.</p>
            <q>Laudumque immenſa Cupido.</q>
            <p>Rather it behov'd him to have given the ſame judgment of <hi>Arria,</hi> as the yong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>Pliny</hi> did, from whom he had the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. <hi>Arria,</hi> ſaid he, the Wife of <hi>Cecinna Poctus,</hi> taking the Dagger to kill her ſelf, giving her ſelf the Stabb, had before her Eyes, the perpetuity of her Honour: And this is the general Reaſon of theſe ſorts of Deaths, which we call Illuſtrious; for which ſome other particular Cauſes, are always alſo alleadged. As the uſual addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Reaſon, of theſe Ladies Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murder, beſide their vanity to Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talize themſelves, was their dread of being expoſed to the indignities of an inhuman Tyrant, abandoned to his own Luſts. This ſame Dread it was that had a ſhare in the Death of <hi>Arria;</hi> for ſhe had reaſon to fear, leſt the Emperor <hi>Claudius,</hi> ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd as he was againſt thoſe who had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:61588:37"/>
part with <hi>Scriboniances,</hi> ſhould put her Husband to ſome cruel Death, and there make ſome further attempt upon her Honour. And it is as viſible rhat <hi>Paulina</hi> had the ſame jealouſies; for no ſooner had <hi>Seneca</hi> her Husband receiv'd orders to dye, but ſhe offered to be his Companion in Death, and cut her own Veins at the ſame time that he open'd his: Yet when <hi>Nero</hi> had aſſur'd her, that he had no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity againſt her, but that he had a high value for her Vertue, and the Grandeur of her Deſcent, ſhe ſuffer'd her Wounds to be bound up, and her Conjugal Amity permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her to live.</p>
            <p>The Opinion of the World, ſaies <hi>Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> was, <hi>That</hi> Paulina <hi>was deſirous to have ſhar'd with her Husband, the Honour of a Death ſo magnanimouſly undergon, ſo long as ſhe thought</hi> Nero's <hi>reſentment would not ſtop there, but when the Tyrant had aſſur'd her, and that ſhe hop'd for better uſage at his Hands then ſhe expected, ſhe eaſily ſurrender'd to the perſuaſions of thoſe that exhorted her to live.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Montaigns</hi> greateſt ſhame is, That hardy Ignorance which emboldens him to reprove thoſe that condemn the expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:61588:37"/>
of <hi>Bloſius,</hi> who vow'd he would have burnt the <hi>Capitol,</hi> had his Friend <hi>Grac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> deſired it. Theſe words which ſeem to him ſo wonderful, are however cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by <hi>Cicero,</hi> as the Expreſſions of a Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain: and to the end it may appear to have been deſervedly done, I will confirm thoſe words, with what <hi>Brutus</hi> ſaid to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi> Tarquinus Collatinus, <hi>my Collegue in the Conſulſhip, is my intimate Friend; but becauſe the name of</hi> Tarquin <hi>is deteſted by you all, and for that it might raiſe a juſt ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition of me, I adviſe ye to Depoſe him from the Conſulſhip.</hi> If therefore we are oblg'd to Sacrifice the Particular Intereſts to the Publick good; which, according to <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle,</hi> is a Celeſtial Good, what are we not oblig'd to do for the ſake of God, or how can we believe, that human Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, ſhould be more predominant, then our Reverence of his Temples? ſo that indeed it is a hard matter to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, how a man in his Witts could ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that perfect Friendſhip was an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement to commit any Crime, and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the Act. <hi>Friendſhip, ſays</hi> Cicero, <hi>is a bad excuſe for Miſcarriages: for the firſt Law that it impoſes upon Perſons, when firſt</hi>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:61588:38"/>
               <hi>united, is neither to require or act any thing to wound the juſtice of the Laws.</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſence would have taught <hi>Montaign</hi> this ſound Doctrine, had he not affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a particular Philoſophy by himſelf; or, rather had not his Judgment been pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his Vanity: and indeed it appears, That all his Hyperbolical, yet weak and ſickly Diſcourſe concerning Friendſhip, proceeded from hence, that he had an i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ching deſire to let the World know what rare Qualities he was endow'd withal, and that he was capable of a ſort of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip not to be parallel'd by any Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
            <p>True it is, That altho it be impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that his Friendſhip with <hi>Stephen</hi> of <hi>Boetia,</hi> ſhould be ſuch as he repreſents it; nevertheleſs, we find and agree, that it was no common Amity, but ſuch a one, that we may do him juſtice, as ought to be ranked with that of <hi>Pliny</hi> the younger, and <hi>Corellius,</hi> or <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Scipio;</hi> that is, among thoſe Friendſhips that are contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without any deſign to advantage our Eſtates, and which is not to be found, but among perſons of Worth and Merit, whom the Vulgar believe to be unbyaſs'd. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:61588:38"/>
they are not ſo; in regard there is no greater profit, or which they whoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts are nice and delicate, more paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately deſire, than what men of ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing parts (when link't together in Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip) reap from the converſation of each other. For that which engages 'em in this ſort of Friendſhip, is the eager deſire which they have to be eſteem'd by a perſon, whom all the World admire, and to find in a Friend a competent judge of his Worth. <q>I have loſt <hi>Corellius,</hi> ſaid <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> the younger, and I bemoan his loſs, for the love of my ſelf, as having loſt a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Teſtimony of my Life and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. <hi>Scipio,</hi> ſaid <hi>Cicero,</hi> was touch'd with that Love which I had for Vertue, and I was an admirer of his.</q> Therefore to define aright the Friendſhip of two men, both endued with extraordinary Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; it is a certain League which they make one with another reciprocally to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve whatever is valuable in each, and to eſteem each other according to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts.</p>
            <p>Ordinary Friendſhips are civil inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, of which we expect to make ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Advantages, correſpondent to our
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:61588:39"/>
different pretenſions, or to ſay better, to our different Paſſions: So that our Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are the viſible cauſes of all the Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips which we contract. Seeing then our deſire of Wealth, is a Paſſion moſt vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and impatient; and that there are a number of people, who have either no E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates at all, or not ſufficient to ſupport their Quality: hence it comes to paſs, that Intereſt is the occaſion of all our ties and Friendſhips; hence it comes to paſs, that men faſt'n themſelves upon Kings, their Favourites and Miniſters, make uſe of all manner of advantages, and take upon 'em all manner of ſhapes, to perſwade them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a belief, how much they are devoted to their Service. This is the reaſon that men crow'd in heaps to the Courts and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces of great Perſonages, as men run to the Publick Springs; for according to the ſaying of <hi>Euripides, When the Earth is parch'd with Drowth, then it moſt earneſtly covets Rain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Paſſion of pleaſure aſſociates and links young People together; and becauſe they do not always find it in one place, by reaſon of the ſeveral obſtacles which they meet with, and for that they frequently
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:61588:39"/>
take diſtaſt, and grow weary, they often change Friends, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> has ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd.</p>
            <p>There is alſo a conceal'd Ambition, which is a third cauſe of Friendſhip. This we meet with in a ſort of people, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote all their time, and make it their ſole buſineſs to attend upon ſome perſon in high Employment, whoſe favour and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation renders 'em conſiderable in the World.</p>
            <p>There is another ſort of Ambition more eaſy to be diſcover'd, and more common, which engages ſeveral people to ſignalize themſelves in all the affairs of their Friends, on pupoſe to make a noiſe in the World, and to put a value upon their Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
            <p>But Men are not only deluded by their Paſſions, which are the occaſion many times, that they conſider themſelves, and ſecretly ſeek their own profit, when they think to ſerve their Friends, after a manner ſeemingly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> altogether void of Intereſt. They are alſo abſurd by their diſpoſitions, and the qualities of their temper, which ſome miſtake for real Inclinations and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of Friendſhip. For the <hi>Cholerie,</hi> who
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:61588:40"/>
act altogether violently, imagine, that when they defend their Enemies, with ſo much heat, it is their zeal which inflames their friendſhip, whereas it is their natural warmth and impetuoſity that chaffs and tranſports 'em. The Melancholic believe they love th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe whom they affect, meerly out of a capricious and obſtinate choice. Women miſtake the ſoftneſs of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, for the tenderneſs of their Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. The Sanguine perſwade themſelves to be more then ordinary Friends, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they are naturally of a careſſing and pleaſant humor, which always enclines 'em to an obliging Converſation in Society, and a readineſs to do kindneſſes. Hence it is, that men can never agree upon the Subject of Friendſhip, and that they form ſo many different <hi>Idea</hi>'s of it: For in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that moſt people derive it from their temperament, and has its Birth from the particular humor that predominates in the perſon, it is impoſſible that all men ſhould conceive and be ſenſible of Friendſhip af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter one and the ſame manner.</p>
            <p>Hence it is, that the Cholerick, whoſe Friendſhip, is fiery and full of tranſport, torment themſelves, cry out and make a
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:61588:40"/>
noiſe upon the misfortunes of their Friends: whereas they who are of ſoft and mild diſpoſition, in the Comedy of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, act only the part of Lamentation and Complaint, and ſometimes think it ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to teſtify their grief, by the ſadneſs of their Countenances and their Silence. And for the ſame reaſon it is, That theſe two ſorts of Friends, diſprove and accuſe one another; the mild and peacable Friend not being able to apprehend, how Friendſhip ſhould conſiſt in making a noiſe, and the impetuous no way approving a ſtill and quiet Amity.</p>
            <p>There are ſome Friendſhips which Men contract, only to obtain others, more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable and advantagious, or to preſerve or re-kindle thoſe that begin to grow old; for the World is ſo judicious, and governs it ſelf ſo ſtrongly by reaſon, that they who deſire ſucceſs in their deſigns, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd to raiſe themſelves as it were, by certain Engines, and to maintain their ground by all ſorts of Artifices: and the way which the honeſter ſort have recourſe, is to fix themſelves with the one, by means of others, and dextrouſly to make it known, that they are the Confidents of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:61588:41"/>
ſuch a Princeſs, or that they have acceſs to ſuch and ſuch perſons of Quality, that they may have admiſſion to the Chief Miniſters of State.</p>
            <p>Here we muſt add to what has been already ſaid, that men are not only falſe when they aſſure us, that they love their Friends with a true Sincerity, or feign to love thoſe for whom they have no af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; but alſo when they would make the world believe, that they have a great number of Friends. Which I take upon me to affirm, becauſe there are a ſort of people who being ſuffer'd at Court, yet neither valu'd nor belov'd, are ſtill vaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the great number of their Friends; ſo that when any perſon of Quality dies, they make a ſhew of being deeply afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and bewail their loſs.</p>
            <p>Before I finiſh this Diſcourſe, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves me to anſwer an objection that ſeems to carry ſomewhat of weight. I mean that proof of Friendſhip ſo remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in <hi>Pylades</hi> and <hi>Oreſtes, Damon</hi> and <hi>Pythias,</hi> ſo obſtinately reſolv'd to lay down their Lives the one for the other.</p>
            <p>We ſhall not go about to leſſen this proof, as we might do, by alledging the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:61588:41"/>
uncertainty of theſe examples, of which the firſt is no where ſupported by the teſtimony of any Hiſtorian: Nor ſhall I urge, the rareneſs of the example, that we meet with only theſe two; in regard we may well grant, that there has been a perſon in the world who offer'd to lay down his Life, nay more that he ſuffer'd Death for his Friend, without departing from our firſt Aſſertion, That there is no ſincere and cordial Amity. For we ſtill maintain, that a man may ſeem to lay down his own to preſerve his Friend's Life, and yet that he ſuffers rather for his own Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; that is, to purchaſe to himſelf a kind of Glory, which is to him ſo much the more charming, as being an act to be talk'd of altogether rare and ſingular. <q>There are ſome people, ſays <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> who rather chuſe to perform one noble and generous Act, then many that are frequent and uſual.</q> Such are they who chuſe to dye for their Friends. Now if it be a difficult thing to apprehend how a man can poſſibly reſolve to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Death, and conſent to his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, for the love of himſelf, we need no more then call to mind ſeveral who and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:61588:42"/>
have kill'd themſelves to be recorded by Poſterity for men of unparallel'd courage and reſolution. We may alſo conſider, that this difficulty of conceiving ſuch a Reſolv'dneſs in Man, proceeds from hence, that we frame our argument of a ſick perſon, as if we were diſcourſing of a perſon in ſound health. For Ambition being one of the moſt violent Diſtempers in men, we muſt know, that it is able to alter his Condition, to deprave his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, and make him more deſirous of that immortal Honour that attends a Great Action, then of long Life.</p>
            <p>And by the ſame rule we are to judg of that noble proof of ſo great and ſo unuſual a piece of Friendſhip which <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> gave to <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> when he ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render'd to him the Honour of the Victory which he won in <hi>Macedon.</hi> And we may believe, upon good grounds, that <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> foreſaw, that Honour which he gave to <hi>Alcibiad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s</hi> would return to him with a much brighter luſtre; and that his nice and delicate Ambition would better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the Merit of a great Action which was without example, then the Honour of winning a Battel.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:61588:42"/>
Let us then with <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> reſolve our Friendſhips into Self-Love, as to their proper original; that it is rivited in the hearts of all men; and that the difference between ordinary Friendſhips and thoſe between perſons of Worth is only this, that they are more refin'd and conceal'd in the one, and more viſible and unpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd in the other. Let us acknowledg and ſincerely c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eſs, that when we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to do ſome particular act of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for our beſt Friend, it proceeds from a thought, that upon ſome occaſion which we foreſee, we ſhall have need of him; or that he will be more careful in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing us, or more diligent to keep us Company. Let us confeſs, I ſay, that theſe motives, and ſome others of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, preſent themſelves to our minds, and ſhare in all our deſigns and reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to oblige thoſe that we reſpect and love. But if after all that we have thus demonſtratively diſcours'd upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, there be any perſons who flatter themſelves, that their ſentiments are more ſincere then thoſe of other men, and that their Friendſhip is exempt from all ſort of Intereſt, we deſire them but to reflect

upon the Accidents that happen to moſt men in the courſe of Human Life, and then how undeniably they prove, that there is no ſincere or real Friendſhip; Not only our Misfortunes and our Buſineſs render them unfaithful, and diſcover to us what they are, but we alſo find by woful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that the ſaying of <hi>Socrates</hi> was not without reaſon, when he affirm'd, <q>That a Man is never more at a loſs then when he is oblig'd to give an account of his Friends.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore true and ſolid Friendſhip is nothing elſe but that ſame <hi>Charity</hi> which unites two perſons together to aſſiſt each other in the Service of God and maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Glory. If <hi>Cicero</hi> believ'd there were very few Friendſhips clear from In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, we may with much more reaſon aver, that there are fewer Chriſtian Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; or rather, that they are ſo rare that we can hardly find one in an Age. And I am the more poſitive in this aſſertion, becauſe that tho they ſeem frequent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in the imagination of thoſe that make a profeſſion of Piety, yet the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of ſuch people too eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade themſelves that their Friendſhips
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:61588:44"/>
are grounded upon Vertue, when they are only grounded upon Nature, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their Birth from Human Sympathies and correſponding Tempers. But moſt aſſuredly we ſhall be aſtoniſh'd when the Day of the Lord ſhall come, and the luſtre of his grand Appearance ſhall diſperſe the night and darkneſs from the Hearts of Men, and diſcover the ſecret foundations of Friendſhip, which Men now eſteem ſo Holy, and maintain in ſo profound a repoſe. <q>The Heavens, ſaith <hi>Job,</hi> which ſeem to be ſo clear and full of Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, are not pure in the ſight of God, nor are the Stars themſelves without Sports.</q> And therefore the reaſon we have to fear, that Men ſeek after human ſatisfactions in vertuous Friendſhips, is this, becauſe they who are lookt upon by the greateſt part of the world as Holy Men, have very few Friends, Correſpondencies, or Intereſts; and for that they cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove in moſt people of worth their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular obligations to Women; believing that the perſon that binds himſelf to a Woman, and devotes all his Services to her, how regular ſoever he may be in his Life and Converſation, is altogether ſway'd
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:61588:45"/>
by ſome ſecret Ambition, if it be not of the number of thoſe that are cheriſh'd by Diligence and Confidence.</p>
            <p>Could we diſcover what lies conceal'd in the folds of mans heart, we ſhould find in the breaſt of the moſt prudent and pious, ſentiments altogether ſtrange and ſurprizing. We ſhould find a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Amours turn'd into Friendſhip; others into Zeal for the good of the Soul; others cover'd with a pretence of Kindred; we ſhould find Amours intermix'd with Ambition, and ſeveral other ſorts of ſuch like Amours, which we could eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, were it proper to dive into that ſubject.</p>

            <p>HE that ſhould deprive a man of all the Kindneſſes which he receives from his Imagination, and ſhould only leave him thoſe which he really enjoy'd, would render him miſerable the greateſt part of his time, or would at leaſt abridg him of a confiderable ſhare of his Felicity. They who doubt of the truth of this, let them but purſue him through the whole courſe of his Life; and they ſhall find him frequently penſive in the midſt of Wealth and Graudeur; which are the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licities which he paſſionately deſires, and which he labours after with ſo much care and trouble, and therefore they are only his Conceits and his Viſions that occaſion his Happineſs and chiefeſt Delight.</p>
            <p>What greater proof of this can we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire then what may be drawn from a ſort of people which we ſee at Court, who
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:61588:46"/>
pride themſelves in nothing more then in being the Confidents of Princes and of Miniſters of State, and all that make a figure in the World; and who are tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with joy every time they bethink themſelves, that perſons of this Rank and that Quality, have pick'd 'em out of a great number of other perſons, and made choice of them to be the Truſtees of their Secrets; And this Confidence ſwells up their Hearts, becauſe they look upon it as an undeniable proof of their Merit, and as a mark of the Friendſhip and Eſteem which thoſe Grandees have for them. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs it is moſt certain, that thoſe Grandees that put their Confidence in them, have no deſign to oblige them by their Confidence, but only that either weakneſs, pleaſure, vanity, or neceſſity are the real cauſes of that Reliance.</p>
            <p>Neceſſity is the viſible cauſe of the great Reliances wherewith the perſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fided in believe themſelves honour'd; and ſuch a man has but little reaſon to think himſelf happy therein, or to have a juſt occaſion of boaſting. But the general cauſes of Reliance are, the fear of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieting and grieving our ſelves, the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:61588:46"/>
of Novelty, and our natural proneneſs to Communication. And theſe cauſes diſpoſe us in ſuch a manner to open our hearts and relye one upon another, that the ſmalleſt occaſions are many times the moſt inevitable ſnares to thoſe who are reckon'd in the number of the wiſeſt and moſt reſerv'd. Inſomuch, that two or three days travel together, or a ſhort converſe in the Country, have a ſtrange power to open their Lips, and diſcloſe the ſecrets of their Hearts.</p>
            <p>There is a ſort of Confidence, of which the cauſe ſeems to be altogether ſtrange, and wherein the perſons themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiding have no ſhare: But to give the Idea of it, we muſt obſerve, that there are a ſort of people who have the Gift to make others Talk. This is a particular Talent, and ſufficient to introduce a man into Court, and to prefer him to the good Opinion of perſons of the beſt Quality. But they who have this, and are unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided of all the reſt, are forc'd to take a great deal of pains, and yet are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently nonplus'd and put to the foyl. For in regard that they are not endow'd with Qualities agreeable, and that they
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:61588:47"/>
are not able to gain the goodwill and favour of perſons of high Condition to whom they make their Addreſſes, they are conſtrain'd to employ their utmoſt induſtry, and to make uſe of all manner of artifices and devices to inſinuate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into their Confidence. So that whereas other perſons that are in good eſteem and acceptable whenever they come, think it ſufficient to make their Viſits at convenient times; The others never ſtir from their Houſes, follow 'em, obſerve 'em and attend 'em all day long, to take the advantage of every moment that they find 'em alone; and by all the obſequious Oratory both of Looks and Geſture to oblige the Grandee to vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe 'em a word of his mouth. And this is the firſt Act of the Comedy. After which they begin ſeveral general diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, to engage the Grandee to ſpeak. But if none of thoſe trains will take, then it is that they fall upon ſubjects wherein they know the Great Perſonage to be concern'd; as the Diſgrace of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and the Fall of thoſe great Officers who have obſtructed his Fortunes at Court; or ſome other piece of news that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:61588:47"/>
will nearly concern him; and then he opens his Heart, and perhaps talks more then he would have done at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time. Therefore they have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to look upon themſelves as men of any great Importance; for it is not out of a deſire to pleaſe them, or to do juſtice to their merit, that they are thus entruſted with the ſecret thoughts of great men, but only to diſcharge themſelves of their preſent cares or tranſports of joy, which they cannot contain within themſelves: So that they never make any reck'ning of the ſecreſie of ſuch people but for their private occaſions.</p>
            <p>True it is, thoſe great Perſonages are kind to the people in whom they repoſe ſuch a Confidence, out of reſpect to the neceſſity which they have of them; but they value them no farther then they have occaſion for their ſeeming fidelity; And therefore there are no ſorts of Confidents that men manage with more care, then ſuch as may become their Accuſers, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure their reputation, or put a ſtop to their affairs. Which is apparent from hence, that bad Subjects who have been deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt the Government, have always
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:61588:48"/>
born a reſpect for thoſe to whom they have been forced to communicate their Intrigues, and that they are much more kind to their Domeſtics where they have been conſtrained to hold their ſecret Meetings, and who have teſtimonies of their private Conferences: Therefore ſays <hi>Juvenal,</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>Quis nunc diligitur niſi Conſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <l>Accuſare poteſt.</l>
               </q>
So that if the Cauſes of Dependencies procure contempt and diſeſteem, the very Subject of theſe Reliances muſt be much more contemptible. For what is it that men talk with ſo much caution, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend to the Boſom of their Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, but certain vain ſtories which the world calls <hi>Affairs?</hi> What is it that men that have the beſt intelligence are ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient to communicate to their moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate Friends? Either that there has been
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:61588:48"/>
a new Quarrel between two prime Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters that have always had a peek one at another; That a Courtier who expected ſome great Preferment at Court, would be ſtrangely ſurprized to hear, that the King had declared himſelf in favour of another perſon; That there has been a diſcovery made of a Ladies Intrigue, who was always lookt upon as a perſon of great vertue and reſerv'dneſs. Can there be any thing more frivolous then ſuch ſtories as theſe, or leſs able to ſatisfie the curioſity, I will not ſay of a Chriſtian, but of a perſon never ſo meanly capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated?</p>
            <p>But if thoſe Truſts which we repoſe in men are to be blam'd, becauſe they are frivolous and dangerous, what ſhall we think of the falſe Confidences and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liances of thoſe that are engaged in the Intrigues of Courts, reciprocally to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover or conceal their Deſigns; to raiſe in one another Diſtruſts of their beſt Friends, wherein they have no other aim but to deceive each other?</p>
            <p>The only Confidence therefore moſt worthy of applauſe, is that when laying all Trifles aſide, we diſcourſe of that
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:61588:49"/>
which is only profitable for our Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and inſtead of deriding and ſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the miſcarriages and defaults of others, we humbly acknowledg our own, and ſtudy real Reformation and Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

            <p>THey who conſider complaiſant Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, how they ſeem to forget them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, on purpoſe to ſympathize with the humours of other men, make uſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance as a powerful Argument to ſhew the falſhood of that Maxim, <hi>That Self-Love is the Fountain of all Vertues purely Human.</hi> For, ſay they, how can Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance derive it's original from Self-Love that riſes out of its Deſtruction, and as it were Built upon its Ruins? But after ſerious Conſideration we ſhall find, that altho Complaiſance appears ſo oppoſite to the inclinations of Self-Love, and ſeems to ſacrifice it every hour, yet ſhe ſerves it with an entire Fidelity, and is more beneficial to it than all the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling parts and rareſt qualities of men. Complaiſance is a Quality very common and ordinary; yet very proper to bring
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:61588:50"/>
about the deſigns of the moſt Ambitious; in ſomuch that frequently it proves a moſt apparent piece of Fraud, and yet always pleaſing and agreeable; a Snare which all the world perceives, and yet catches the moſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>fin'd and ſubtil Politicians. So that we may ſay to Complaiſance what the Marſhal <hi>D'Ancre</hi> ſaid to one of his Flatterers,</p>

               <l>Tu m' aduli, ma tu mi paci,</l>
               <l>Thou Flatters, yet thou Pleaſes me.</l>
            </q>
            <p>But the Complaiſance which Men al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways obſerve to great Perſonages, in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver oppoſing their Wills; but humour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 'em without contradiction, is a Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery in Action much more delicate and pleaſing then that of Words; For they who conform themſelves to all the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of the perſon obſerv'd, ſeem per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually to encourage 'em, andpprove whatever they ſay or do. Which ſort of Complaiſance in time brings great effects to paſs; as being that which ſeems to hold a correſpondence with Self-Love, and to apprehend its real Intentions that we ſhould pleaſe her in all things.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:61588:50"/>
There is alſo a Politic and <hi>Preventive</hi> ſort of Complaiſance; which I call ſo, in regard that by means of this preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Complaiſance we approve the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of thoſe whom we deſire to pleaſe, before they have declar'd their thoughts; which we meet with in perſons grown old in Court Services, and that are alſo men of piercing and judicious under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings. Which being join'd with their experience, give 'em a quick apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion how the Prince, his Favourite, or his prime Miniſter are inclin'd upon all occaſions and affairs that preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; ſo that they can eaſily foreſee and divine where their determinations will ſtop; which they no ſooner div'd into, but they preſently propound the very way which they forſee he intends to take; which pleaſes him beyond all the praiſes and commendations that could have been attributed to him. This clear-ſighted Complaiſance is of ſo high a value, and ſo beneficial, that when it is in abſolute perfection, it is ſufficient of it ſelf to make a compleat Courtier, and to advance his Fortune above his expectations or his very wiſhes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:61588:51"/>
There is another ſort of Complaiſance, generally very diſpleaſing, of which they that make a profeſſion ſpeak well of all ſorts of people, and excuſe the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and actions of men for which no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe can be given. This ſort of Complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant perſons ſignalize themſelves when they extenuate the ſaults of their Friends. And ſome of them will carry their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance to that degree, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure that any great Perſonage for whom they have an eſteem ſhould fail of any Quality, not ſo much as of thoſe that are no way neceſſary for ſo great a Man, and which are many times as little becoming their Grandeur and Condition. There was formerly one of theſe <hi>Complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants</hi> at Court, a very honeſt Gentleman, but ſo great an Admirer of a certain No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman (whoſe Valour was no way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to that of the moſt celebrated Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in ancient times) that he could not endure to have him deny'd to have an excellent Voice, a Quality ſo little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to the Ornament of a great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, that it is rather in the number of thoſe that might redound to his injury, eſpecially when overvalu'd for it. <q>Art

            <p>There is another ſort of Complaiſance which is both unworthy and criminal; When certain vicious perſons are ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to their Friends, and perſons on whom they depend, that they applaud whatever they do, and are always ready to act whatever they command; with this difference however, that ſome of them excuſe the unjuſt humours of their Friends, their Maſters or Superiors, becauſe it is not in their power to reſiſt them; whereas others make it their whole buſineſs to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them in all manner of Violences and Injuſtice, and ſacrifice their Honour and their Conſciences to thoſe from whom they hope to receive Kindneſſes.</p>
            <p>There is another ſort of Complacence that is not only a trouble but a torment to a man; which we meet with in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral people, who ſticking like Burs to ſome great Lord, follow him like his ſhadow, and pry ſo narrowly into his very inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that they be able to foreſtall him, and not leave him to himſelf in any thing; that is, that would have the objects of their Reſpects to be without action or
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:61588:52"/>
motion, like that of Idols, only that they ſhould be thought to be complaiſant and agreeable by being troubleſom.</p>
            <p>There is alſo an honeſt ſort of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance in thoſe who preſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>There is yet another ſort of Complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant perſons altogether oppoſite to thoſe already mention'd, who will ſtoop to a thouſand baſe actions to compaſs their ends; they will take upon 'em the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt errands and loweſt Offices that a great Perſon will vouchſafe to require at their Hands, even to perform the Duty of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and Lacqueys. This ſort of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance, that deſerves only the reward of contempt, is not always unprofitable however; for tho they are deſpis'd by thoſe that employ them, yet they fail not ſometime to partake of their Favours.</p>

By what has been ſaid, it is eaſie to ſee' that Intereſt is the Soul of Complaiſance' and that it diſpoſes of a man ſo abſolutely, that let him be never ſo proud and haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it makes him the cringing Adorer and Slave of Greatneſs and Splendour. But tho it be the moſt uſual, yet it is not the only cauſe of Complaiſance; for there are ſome Complaiſant perſons, who pretend to no more then to be eſtenm'd and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected in the Society where they live; and others meerly to gratifie their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral humour and inclination.

He that lately cring'd before a Favourite, when he finds him declining, makes no more reck'ning of him, but treats him then like another man. He that ſtudied to pleaſe thoſe perſons that made up the Society of which he was a Member, leaves them and knows them no longer, when the allurement of a Novelty has carried him into another. So that there are none who are of a humour truly Complaiſant, but thoſe who are always ſo.</p>

All Human Complacency is without merit, or vitious in its original.

            <p>THE Juriſdiction of Juſtice is confin'd within thoſe narrow limits, that tho ſhe be ſupream and renders her ſelf for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable by thoſe puniſhments which ſhe prepares for thoſe that dare preſume to violate her Laws, ſhe is not able never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs to terrifie the wicked, nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the irregularities of men, in regard the Crimes which they conceal in their Breaſts, and thoſe that never come to knowledg eſcape her Rigor; and for that there are a million of Errors committed every day which come not within the compaſs of the Law. Vertue has a juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of a far larger extent: For beſides that wicked contrivances are no ſooner conceived in the Soul, but ſhe puniſhes them by the remorſe of Conſcience; ſhe generally regulates all the external acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Man in ſuch a manner, that ſhe
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:61588:54"/>
will not ſuffer any one in the leaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Reaſon.</p>
            <p>And thus we ſee, that perfect Vertue is not only contented to furniſh man with the knowledge and ſentiments of what he is to do in the particular exerciſe of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Life in private; but ſhe inſtructs him how to d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

She alſo teaches him to know the particular obligations wherein he is bound by the Tye of Society; ſuch as are thoſe of obſerving the Rules of Juſtice in Commerce: And alſo thoſe which men believe to be leſs important, ſuch are the obligations upon all men living together, to honour and mutually to eſteem one another.</p>

               </gap> that Vertue incites us under the name of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility. 'Tis true, that Chriſtian Ver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ue obliges us by motives much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ore ſolid and exalted then are thoſe that Human Vertue propoſes to us. For ſhe inſtructs us, that ſince God has appointed Men to live <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ogether in Society, and that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf has aſſembl'd them together; it is his pleaſure, that they ſhould reverence the League that unites them together by
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:61588:54"/>
his Command; and that they ſhould care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully avoid all thoſe occaſions that uſually cauſe the breaches of it. And therefore it is, that he ſo often in the Sacred Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings recommends the preſervation of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord one among another, to do no Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to bear one with another, to Love one another, and to be always ready to pay mutual Honour and Civility, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out expecting Retaliation. For the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent violation of theſe Precepts is the moſt uſual ſource of Hatred and Quarrels. The reaſon is, becauſe that men through the violence of Self-Love deſire always to live free from Injury, and look upon it as a miſchief inſupportable to be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn'd or Diſreſpected: Inſomuch, that if they be not Viſited, if Men refuſe to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute 'em, or to ſpeak to them with Reſpect and Eſteem, they grow preſently angry and incens'd againſt thoſe that ſo treat them with ſcorn and indifferency; And this ſame impatience transforming it ſelf into averſion, eſtranges and diſ-unites the affections of Men.</p>
            <p>As for thoſe motives that govern thoſe who diſcharge the Duties of Civility out of deſigns purely Human, which rules the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:61588:55"/>
chiefeſt part of perſons of Quality, is no other then a deſire to be accounted ſuch as have been vertuouſly educated, that they are men of Breeding and poliſh'd Behaviour. Therefore it is that they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form themſelves with ſo much curioſity of the Birth and Qualities of every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, tho never ſo little known, to the end they may not miſtake in paying thoſe Civilities that are proportionable to their Condition and their Merit.</p>
            <p>Among the reſt of Men, Civility is ſometimes a fear of being otherwiſe look'd upon as ſavage Brutes, or men incapable of Diſcipline; but more frequently, it is fear of prejudice occaſion'd by Incivility. For as we gain the Hearts of thoſe with whom we converſe, by teſtifying a value for their perſons; ſo we provoke and irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate their ill will by ſlighting their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. Hence it comes to paſs, that we find ſo many men irregular in their Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, unjuſt and unfaithful, yet very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act in the exerciſe of Civility; becauſe they perceive that men tranſgreſs againſt Civility with leſs impunity then they that offend againſt the Laws of Temperance, Fidelity, and Juſtice. For ſeeing that
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:61588:55"/>
amongſt all the offences committed againſt the Perſons of Men, there is not one which he more keenly reſents then that of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; he conceives ſuch a mortal aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion againſt thoſe that pay him not thoſe Honours which the common Cuſtom of the world requires, that it is impoſſible for him to have any favourable ſentiments for thoſe people. So that whenever he is conſtrain'd to allow them thoſe praiſes which he cannot refuſe their perſons, he always intermixes ſome malignant character of their failings.</p>
            <p>Vanity has alſo a great ſhare in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility of Women: For they are overjoy'd to be oblig'd to viſit their Friends, and congratulate their proſperity upon any occaſion; hoping there to meet with ſtore of Company, where they may diſplay their Beauty, the Riches of their Habit, and exactneſs of their Dreſs.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Cuſtom and want of Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment contribute much to the Civility of moſt people. Idleneſs, becauſe that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving nothing to do, they are glad to go a viſiting where they may ſpend their time with ſome ſatisfaction. Cuſtom, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it draws after it all the world; and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:61588:56"/>
for that an infinite number of people go whither their obligations engage 'em, not as being led and guided by the perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Reaſon, but to go where they ſee others go before.</p>
            <p>Hence it is eaſie to conclude, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons civil, honeſt, and careful, which we find ſo obliging, whom we commend, and in whom the World is ſo well ſatisfied, ſeek only themſelves and their own ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in all that they pretend to do to oblige others, and by conſequence, that Civility which has no other principles then thoſe which actuate the generality of the world, is a deceitful Vertue.</p>

               <q>I Cannot endure, ſaid <hi>Zeno,</hi> thoſe Philoſophers that place a ſwarm of Vertues in the Soul; for ſince we do not divide the ſound Diſpoſition of the Body to make ſeveral ſorts of Health, why ſhould we make ſeveral Vertues of the good Diſpoſition of the Soul.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This Philoſopher would have been much more offended had he known all the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues which Intereſt has made; or had he obſerv'd, that in all the numerous Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies in the world, eſpecially thoſe of Great Perſonages, there are ſeveral perſons that exerciſe a certain Vertue of a particular Nature, which we may call <hi>Officious Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</hi> For they do viſibly perplex them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to have a ſhare in the repoſe of their Confidence, they only pretend to be near their Perſons for their Servants, to excuſe their Faults, and commend their faithful Services.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:61588:57"/>
But tho theſe perſons that enjoy the Favour of Great Men, ſeem no way de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to make any other uſe of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, but only to render it beneficial to their Servants; yet are they not without three very great conceal'd pretences: The firſt is, to ſtifle the Envy that always at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends upon ſuch as are in proſperity; which is a frivolous deſign, and without any ground. For there is nothing ſo diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult as to cure thoſe that are tormented with that paſſion; ſo that all we can do is to prevent their open murmuring and venting their diſpleaſure. For all Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments kindle and provoke Envy, and when ſhe is once rais'd, let the conduct of Favourites be never ſo prudent and obliging, it is never able to appeaſe it.</p>
            <p>Their ſecond pretence is, they are paid in the ſame inſtances of Civility. Which is a very idle pretence, and prooceeds from the little knowledg which they have of the Inclinations of man. For there is a natural malignity which can never be rooted out of the heart; which is the reaſon that he cannot be diſpoſed to be really favourable and kind to thoſe that uſe him well. So that if men are ſo oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:61588:57"/>
one to another, we labour in vain to engage any to be ſincere to our Intereſts. For by what art can a perſon who ſtands right in the good opinion of his Prince, ſo order and manage the Diſpoſitions of all his Dependants, that they ſhall every one ſupport him, when they find an opportunity to advance themſelves to his prejudice?</p>
            <p>But the principal and moſt uſual pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention is, for the procuring of mutual Favours, to ſerve them with the ſame zeal when their own concernments come upon the ſtage. For they who have the Favour of great Men, generally propoſe by others the ſcope of their deſires, to ſound and diſcover their diſpoſitions, or becauſe their Modeſty will not permit them to ſpeak boldly for themſelves. But this laſt pretence is no leſs frivolous then the reſt; ſince there is nothing more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent then that we are generally abus'd when we rely upon the acknowledgment of men: For when an occaſion preſents it ſelf, by which they hope to reap the recompence of their good offices, they find themſelves deſerted, or that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons oblig'd only ſerve 'em by way of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:61588:58"/>
requital, coldly and careleſly. Then they make bitter complaints, and load with reproaches the perſons that have ſo ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully fail'd 'em. But while they thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach their ingratitude, they are not aware how they betray themſelves, and ſhew that they are not of a Diſpoſition apt to do kindneſs; in regard they that are truly ſo, find their recompence and their ſatisfaction in the care which they take of others, and never think of gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the kindneſſes they do.</p>
            <p>There are none then but only true Chriſtians who ſincerely deſire their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours advantages, and who for his ſake only embrace all occaſions to ſerve him in his affairs. In regard that Charity that rules in their hearts, takes from 'em thoſe evil inclinations which they have inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from <hi>Adam;</hi> and for that God creates in 'em new Inclinations, which obliges them to do all the Kindneſſes they can for others, without expecting any return to themſelves.</p>

Moreover, how can Death be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to Man; Death, that is the only Original of his Happineſs, which he cannot enjoy ſo long as he continues chain'd and fetter'd to the Body.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Then again, if we are deſirous to know

what that Miſchief is which we have moſt reaſon to fear, he anſwers, that there is no Miſchief more formidable then Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: <q>For, ſays he, Ignorance is the Corruption of all the good Qualities in Man, we may deſervedly call it the Death of the Soul.</q> For as the Life of the Soul conſiſts in acting with parts and underſtanding, it is apparent that when Ignorance blinds her, ſhe is diſabled from governing and regulating her own motions and the exterior actions of Man according to the orders of Reaſon; that is, it hinders man from living Rationally, and ſuch a Life as is moſt proper to his extraction.</p>
            <p>And among all the Vertues that ado<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n the Soul, none adds more Splendour to it then Clemency, which ariſes from the univerſal deteſtation we have of Cruelty, imprinting in our minds a fair Idea of its contrary. For who does not abhor <hi>Sylla</hi> for his horrid Inhumanities committed in <hi>Rome,</hi> and loath the memory of <hi>Nero</hi> for the murther of his Mother, his Wife, and his Tutor? On the other ſide, we are ready to adore <hi>Titus,</hi> when we call to mind the proteſtation that he made to
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:61588:59"/>
the Gods in <hi>Jeruſalem, That he was Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent of the Blood that had been ſpilt in the Siege of that City.</hi> And when we remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber his Clemency towards his Brother; for after he had diſcover'd the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy of <hi>Domitius</hi> againſt his Life, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued him in the ſame Honours, and the ſhare which he had before in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and with Tears requeſted the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators to be Friends with him. But if we deſire a true knowledg of Clemency, we muſt not conſider the Luſtre which Cruelty gives it, nor as ſhe is in thoughts and ſentiments of thoſe on whom ſhe beſtows her Favours; nor judg of her by what ſhe appears to be; for ſhe is in in the number of the moſt glittering Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. We muſt behold her as ſhe is in her ſelf, and weigh the reaſons that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly incline us to queſtion, Whether ſhe be a real Vertue or no.</p>
            <p>The firſt reaſon is, That thoſe Princes who are by Hiſtorians applauded for their Clemency never exercis'd it but upon par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular occaſions, or at moſt only during ſome part of their Reign. Now true Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue carries an equality with it: <q>There muſt, ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:61588:60"/>
Vertuous Actions to make a man Vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</q> We do not find this equality in the Clemency of <hi>Julius Caeſar, Auguſtus,</hi> or <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, there not being one of all the three that perſever'd in his Clemency. Which is viſible in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of <hi>Alexander:</hi> For when he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued the Province of the <hi>Coſſeans,</hi> Why was not he ſatisfied with the puniſhment of thoſe who had made ſome reſiſtance, why did he not pardon the Women and Children, but put all to the Sword? The ſame may be ſaid of <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> and <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> both the one and the other ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſhew'd themſelves cruel upon ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral occaſions where they ought to have exercis'd their Clemency.</p>
            <p>The ſecond proof which ſhews us clearly the Falſhood of Human Clemency, is drawn from hence, that we find it coupl'd with Cruelty in the ſame perſons already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd. Which makes it clearly evident, that when they perform'd thoſe acts of Clemency, their inclinations and ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments did not approve their preſent Leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and that they did not carry in their Souls that Goodneſs which always inclines us to Mildneſs and Indulgence; ſeeing
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:61588:60"/>
that ſort of Goodneſs is incompatible and inconſiſtent with the ſeverity and rigour of Cruelty. <hi>Caeſars</hi> Cruelty appear'd by the murther of a great number of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Pretors and Conſuls which he put to Death in <hi>Africa,</hi> and by that of <hi>Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conius</hi> and <hi>Galba,</hi> who were murthered by his Soldiers in the midſt of <hi>Rome,</hi> by his Order, or at leaſt with his Conſent. The Cruelty of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> was apparent in the horrible Butchery of near three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Senators and two thouſand Knights. That of <hi>Alexander</hi> in the Deaths of <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, Calliſthenes, Philotas,</hi> and <hi>Parmenio;</hi> and by the unworthy maſſacre of thoſe faithful and ſtout Defenders of the Free-Cities, who after they had ſurrenderd one City upon the Faith of Articles agreed and ſign'd to, were inhumanly murder'd by his Soldiers.

Language of <hi>Plutarch, Quintus Curtius,</hi> and the moſt Hiſtorians, who after they have aſcribed ſeveral Vertues to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whoſe Lives they write, from certain Actions evidently Vertuous, when after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they find the ſame perſons liable to Vices oppoſite to thoſe Vertues which they applauded in 'em, they would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the World that thoſe Vices pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the change of their Manners, and not from their Natural Diſpoſitions.

               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that any men naturally Mild become Cruel, or that others being born Cruel become Gentle and Humane: For our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations are ſo fix'd to the Conſtitution of our Being, that we may as well change the one as the other. True it is, there is a kind of alteration in our Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that when the Blood is cool we are not ſo vehement and furious, as in the heat and impetuoſity of Youth; but that this change is ſufficiently preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent entirely to deſtroy our Inclinations, or that the coolneſs of our Blood extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes our predominant paſſions, is that which I could never yet obſerve. On
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:61588:61"/>
the other ſide, I have met with perſons who at the Age of Fourſcore were as cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leric and violent, others as falſe and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and malicious as they were at five and twenty or thirty. I have alſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, that tho the fear of being counted ridiculous be ſo powerful over all men, who have ſenſe and underſtanding, yet we ſee perſons of great Wit, who when they come to be ſtricken in years, and find themſelves diſabled by Age, yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not forbear their juvenile Gallantries. In a word, 'tis my opinion, that neither Age, nor Exhortation, nor Promiſes; nor Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that can correct our wicked Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, when they are natural; for then the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ary is this, becauſe they believe that when the inclinations are wearied, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puls'd for a time, they are quite deſtroy'd. Which is the reaſon that ſome erroneouſly miſtake Cruelty tyr'd for true Clemency. <q>
                  <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> ſaid <hi>Seneca,</hi> who after ſo many Murthers and Proſcriptions, gave <hi>Cinna</hi> his Life, did that act of Clemency, that people might believe him Merciful:</q>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:61588:62"/>
For my part, I know not how to call that perſon Merciful, who is weary of being Cruel. Others imagine, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who leave the Court are cur'd of Ambition, when it may be only the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents of Repulſes and Diſappointments. Others applaud for his Liberality a man that is profuſe in his Expences, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that his Vanity reſtrains and curbs his Avarice. Moreover, many people are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, when they perſwade themſelves, that a man has not the ſame Inclinations, when they ſee his Inclinations do not tend to the ſame object; not conſidering, for example, that Avarice is the reaſon that we addict our ſelves to Gaming, and that we leave it off.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe reaſons to prove the error of that opinion, that men change their Inclinations, and of Mild become Cruel, there is one much more conſiderable, that is, that moſt people acknowledg nothing to be Cruelty but that natural Cruelty which produced thoſe Monſters of Men, every day drunk with Human Blood, ſuch as <hi>Herod, Nero,</hi> and <hi>Domitian;</hi> and for that they do not perceive<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that Ambition is Furious and Cruel, and that men poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:61588:62"/>
with that Fury, are always ready to commit all manner of Exceſſes and Violences upon all thoſe they believe to be obſtacles to their deſigns. So that let an Ambitious man be never ſo Mild, ſo ſoon as he has conceiv'd a deſign to make his Name famous to Eternity, tho it coſt him that immortal Glory which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes to himſelf, and to obtain it there is a neceſſity of Extirpating whole Nations, he makes no ſcruple of ſuch Inhumani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. And this is the reaſon that great Conquerors, ſuch as <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> never make it a matter of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to uſe Sword or Poyſon for the deſtruction of whatever perſons ſtand in their way. Nevertheleſs it did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hove the Hiſtorians to ſay as they do, that if <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Caeſar</hi> were guilty of Actions ſo Cruel and contrary to their natural Goodneſs, it was an argument that their Manners and Inclinations were chang'd, becauſe at the ſame time that they ſhew'd themſelves moſt Cruel, they alſo ſhew'd ſeveral acts of Clemency. But if we would judg rationally of thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and underſtand to what principle we ought to refer their different Conduct,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:61588:63"/>
we muſt make a recollection of all the Actions of their Lives. For then we ſhall ſee that they were perſons that burn'd with an eager Ambition to acquire a more then ordinary Renown, or to obtain the Soveraign Power, and were ſo maſter'd by the intereſt of their Ambition, that they did whatever their Ambition requir'd. So that when their Ambition thought it proper to pardon their greateſt Enemies, how cruel ſoever they naturally were, they pardon'd without any trouble. If their intereſt or ambition requir'd them to cut the Throats of their beſt Friends, they condeſcended with the ſame eaſe. So that they were cruel at the ſame time that they diſpens'd their Favours, becauſe they were as ready to put to Death thoſe they had pardon'd, if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e condition of their Affairs requir'd it. Whence it is eaſie to conclude, that the Cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mency of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Auguſtus,</hi> and <hi>Caeſar,</hi> ſo highly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded, was only Policy. Nor is there any farther Queſtion to be made of this, when we conſider, that <hi>Alexander</hi>'s firſt Behaviour in <hi>Aſia</hi> was courteous and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous, as being then requiſite to make himſelf belov'd by the principal Officers
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:61588:63"/>
of his Army, and the perſons of Quality that follow'd him. Beſides, that it was alſo a ſnare which he laid for the people which he deſign'd to ſubdue. On the contrary, his behaviour towards his lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end was rigorous and inhuman, thro his miſtruſt and jealouſie of his moſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Servants and beſt Friends, whom he put to Death with ſo much ingratitude and cruelty. The ſame may be ſaid of <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Auguſtus.</hi> For <hi>Auguſtus</hi> in his latter years ſhew'd himſelf Merciful, to try whether his Clemency would ſucceed better then his Cruelty; and be a means to qualifie the Hatred which the people had of his Tyranny. As for <hi>Caeſar,</hi> every one knows, that at the ſame time that he receiv'd <hi>Cicero,</hi> and ſeveral other conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable perſons that gave a luſtre to his Party, with ſo much lenity and mildneſs, he Baniſh'd and put to Death all that would not bend their knees before him, and implore his Mercy, with ſubmiſſions altogether adject and unſeemly. <hi>Plutareh</hi> relates, that <hi>Sylla</hi> took the ſame courſe, and that when he maſſacred ſeven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of the <hi>Roman</hi> Citizens, he carefully preſerv'd thoſe that were his devoted
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:61588:64"/>
Slaves. The ſame Author adds, that the ſame perſon had no reſpect to the Quality of the Crimes, but that he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned all that favour'd his proceedings, or whom he hop'd to gain to his party; and puniſhed with Death the ſlighteſt Offences of thoſe that were not by<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſs'd by his Intereſts. Such was the Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe Victors and Emperors, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Mild, ſometimes Cruel, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times both together; employing both their Vertues and their Vices, and making uſe of whatever may be ſerviceable to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe their Empires.</p>
            <p>The Clemency of <hi>Nero</hi> at his firſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement to the Empire was the effect of a refin'd and ſingular Policy. For he knew ſo exactly how to reſtrain and conceal the ſavage Barbarity of his Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Diſpoſition, and to appear ſoft and good natur'd, that during the firſt five years of his Reign, his Subjects could not but applaud his Lenity and Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; while he deſervedly Glory'd, that in all that time he had not ſhed one drop of Blood through the whole extent of his Empire. <hi>Domitian</hi> imitated Him in his Clemency, to the end that like him he
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:61588:64"/>
might afterwards fly out into all manner of Cruelty. In a word, the Clemency of theſe two Tyrants was feign'd and concerted, artificial and deceitful. And we ſay, that it was a ſly trick, like that of ſome Beaſts, that ſuffer people to come near and handle 'em, that they may the more eaſily devour the people ſo deluded within their reach.</p>
            <p>The good Humour of Princes is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the cauſe of their Clemency; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that good Humour proceed from the Diſpoſition of their Bodies, or from ſome ſecret ſatisfaction of their deſires and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. For as often as we are pleaſed our ſelves we have an Inclination to pleaſe others, and to grant 'em what they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and what they earneſtly requeſt.</p>
            <p>When Clemency is too frequent and cuſtomary with a Prince, it is ſo far from being a Vertue, that it is in him the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of all Royal Vertues; as being a quality ſo miſchievous to his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that it is the moſt general cauſe of their Ruin. It is an ignorance of the uſe and neceſſity of Juſtice; <q>Without which, ſays St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> Commonwealths and Empires are but numerous Societies
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:61588:65"/>
of Robbers.</q> 'Tis a falſe and ill-extended Goodneſs, a cruel Lenity, and a vitious Indifference in reference to public Order and Repoſe. Such was the Clemency which <hi>Titus</hi> affected after he obtained the Empire; nor can we forbear, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his being call'd, <hi>The Delight of Mankind,</hi> to cenſure the Oath which he ſwore, <hi>Never to put any man to Death,</hi> which was an Oath by which he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the ſight of Heaven to be the Protector of Robbers and Homicides, to authorize all ſorts of Attempts and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies, and to ranverſe and deſtroy the Empire. As for that Oath which <hi>Nerva</hi> took at his firſt reception into the Senate, that he would never ſuffer any Senator to be condemn'd to Death for any Crime whatſoever, it was only a ſneaking Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment which he put upon the Senators, diſapprov'd by themſelves, and which gave occaſion to the <hi>Roman</hi> Conſul to utter this generous Expreſſion: <hi>'Tis a great Misfortune to Live under a Prince that oppreſſes his Subjects, and commands them as his Slaves; But it is a much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Miſery, to Live under a Prince that gives them their full ſwinge, and proſtitutes</hi>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:61588:65"/>
               <hi>all things to their Licentious Pleaſure.</hi> If therefore we deſire to know the real cauſe of the Clemency of theſe two Emperors, we ſhall find it to be only a ſecret Fear of being deſtroy'd by the Factions of the Great Men, or maſſacr'd by the People, as almoſt all their Predeceſſors had been. For <hi>Vitellius, Otho, Nero,</hi> and <hi>Caligula,</hi> who all preceded <hi>Titus,</hi> had every one ſuffer'd untimely Deaths by that means; and <hi>Nerva</hi> aſcending the Throne, found it beſmear'd with the Blood of <hi>Domitian.</hi> And this we ſhall find to be true, eſpecially in reſpect of <hi>Titus,</hi> when we conſider, that Mildneſs was by no means his Natural temper; for his Conſulſhip was ſo cruel, that it was publickly ſaid, That if he ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in the Empire, he would prove a ſecond <hi>Nero.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding that there are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral falſe kinds of Clemency, it does not hinder but that there may be a real ſort of Clemency; and that this real and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Clemency may be a great Ornament to a Soveraign Prince. The true Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters whereof are as follow:</p>
            <p>Now we know, that altho the proper function of Clemency is either abſolutely
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:61588:66"/>
to remit thoſe puniſhments which Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders have deſerv'd, or to remit ſomething of their rigour; and ſo all that are in Authority and have power to puniſh, may in ſome meaſure be ſaid to be Merciful; Nevertheleſs, in regard that Fathers and Tutors have no other Puniſhment at their diſpoſal then only ſuch as are call'd Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſements; ſince they who have the power of Life and Death, as the Judges, are not able to hinder the effects of their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, and therefore that only Soveraign Princes have only power to ſave thoſe whom the Law has condemn'd to Dye; all the World muſt grant, That Clemency is the Vertue of Kings. <q>Fortune, ſaid <hi>Cicero</hi> to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> could do nothing greater for Thee, then to make Thee Maſter of the Lives of Men. And the Goodneſs of thy Natural temper can inſpire Thee with nothing more generous, then with a Will to make uſe of thy Power to the eaſe of the Diſtreſſed.</q> So that Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency may well be call'd the laſt Refuge of Man: <q>For in regard the Laws are deaf, ſevere, and inexorable, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Man, ſays <hi>Livy,</hi> would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly unhappy, if being ſo frail as it
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:61588:66"/>
is, there were no way to eſcape their Rigour but by Innocency.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This weakneſs and frailty of Man is the firſt foundation of the Royal Clemency. For upon many occaſions that touch him to the quick, and ſurprize him, as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, when a Man ſees his Brother ſlain before his eyes, ſuch a ſight ſo ſtrongly moves his natural Affection, that he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues the Mur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>herers like a Madman, even to the expoſing of his own Life. This is therefore that which a Clement Prince conſiders; for as he is always diſpoſed graciouſly to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>lend an Ear to all that may excuſe a ſuppliant Criminal he willingly admits ſuch an allegation, that the Often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der kill'd the Man only to revenge his Brothers Death; that he had not time to conſult his reaſon upon ſo ſhort a warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> he was tranſported by his Natural Affections.</p>
            <p>Crimes alſo committed by accident and misfortune are a ſecond ground of Royal Clemency. For if Crimes voluntarily committed may be thought to deſerve Pardon, becauſe the force of Natural Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection has conſtrain'd the Will into Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; with much more reaſon ought thoſe
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:61588:67"/>
Crimes to be pardon'd, which a man commits contrary to his Intention, as the <hi>French</hi> Gentleman, who ſhooting at a Wild Boar, kill'd his near Kinſman and one of his deareſt Friends.</p>
            <p>Juſtice alſo is a third ground of Royal Clemency. For they juſtly exerciſe it in favour of thoſe Offenders, whoſe Crimes are leſs than the Services which they have done the Public; and ſome regard may be alſo had to the Deſerts of their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors. For Puniſhments, as <hi>Plato</hi> has obſerv'd, were not ordain'd to prevent the Criminal Acts, ſince all the ſeverity of Law, and all the power of Soveraignty cannot prevent their being committed; nor does Juſtice in the Sentences of Death propoſe the Amendment of thoſe that are executed: Therefore the Legiſlators had no other aim in ordering the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments of Crimes, than to procure the public Good; that is, to terrifie the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and prevent Honeſt people from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing debauch'd by their bad example. So that, as the Public Intereſt excuſes the Cruelty of the Law, and all Men ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the Executing of Robbers and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Villains: The ſame Public Good
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:61588:67"/>
juſtifies the Clemency of Princes in ſaving from an ignominious Death, ſuch as have ſignaliz'd themſelves in Defence of their King and Country; by which means their good Service has been more beneficial to the Kingdom, than the Fact which they committed, or the bad Example given was ever prejudicial.</p>
            <p>There was ſomething of particular rarity in the Clemency of <hi>Theodoſius:</hi> For he puniſh'd his Anger by his Clemency; and never fail'd to make uſe of it towards thoſe that had incens'd him, even to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment. So that they were ſure to be pardon'd the Offences which they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt him, who had but the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to provoke him to Rage.</p>
            <p>As for the Character of true Clemency, by which we may know and diſtinguiſh it from that which is falſe; <hi>Cicero</hi> tells us. <q>That real Clemency agrees with Juſtice.</q> 
               <q>A Wiſe Prince, ſaid the <hi>Stoics,</hi> ought not to have that effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Pity which cannot endure the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of Offenders; rather he ought to preſer the wholeſom Rigour of the Law before the Dictates of a tend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

But becauſe the Moral Vertues are only imperfect Vertues, and for that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be perfect nor accompliſh'd, if not practis'd by motives Divine and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural, Kings that have a deſire to be Vertuouſly Clement, muſt raiſe themſelves above the common motives and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and in all their Gracious Acts propoſe to themſelves the imitation of that God who has ſo bountifully diſplay'd his own Mercy in the Redemption of Mankind from an Eternity-of Torment.</p>

            <p>WE may ſay of Human Vertues, what is uſually ſaid of Men, that they are born, ſome under Good, ſome under Bad Conſtellations. For there are ſome Vertues that are ſo extreamly admir'd and have that wonderful ſucceſs in the world; others ſo little regarded, that they ſcarce deſerve to be rank'd in the number of Vertues. For in truth we find, that Generoſity, Clemency, and Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity, and ſome other Vertues of the ſame nature, are not only the object<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the People's Admiration, but alſo the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:61588:69"/>
To be convinc'd of this Truth, we have no more to do than to examine, what is the Office of <hi>Mildneſs,</hi> and to compare it with Clemency, to which it ſeems to be nearly related. For we ſhall find that Clemency indeed ſhines with a geater Luſter, but that there is more of Merit in <hi>Mildneſs.</hi> And that which proves it ſo to be is this, That Princes are not ſenſible of moſt Crimes but out of their Duty, and that their Clemency not being able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand their Sentiments, they put no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint upon themſelves when they grant their Pardons; whereas <hi>Mildneſs</hi> has to deal with the boyling Motions of Choler, which riſe in a Perſon, touch'd to the quick in his concerns of Honour, or unjuſtly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb'd in his Intereſts. And this gives to <hi>Mildneſs</hi> a wonderful advantage over Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency; and makes it evident at the ſame time, that we cannot rationally prefer any Vertue before that, and has the power to ſubdue a Paſſion ſo violent as Choler.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> leſſens the Merit of Mildneſs; for he deprives her of a part of her Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, for he maintains <q>That the Office of this Vertue is not abſolutely to deſtroy, but only to moderate Choler.
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:61588:69"/>
And the reaſon that perſwades him, is this, becauſe he believes that Choler is natural to a Man, when he concludes that it is alſo beneficial to him, ſince Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture does nothing in vain. Thereupon he aſſures us, that it ſerves him as a Goad that ſpurrs him awake, and pricks him forward to undertake with vigor Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous and Great Actions. Farther he ſays, That Choler creates the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of the Valiant, and the vehemency of Orators, and that it had a ſhare as well in the Hand of <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> as in the Fame of <hi>Themiſtooles;</hi> and then he adds, That Choler is not only uſeful to Man, but that it is alſo abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. For it is in him, as the Handmaid of Reaſon, whoſe Commands ſhe exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutes with fervency, and aſſiſts him in the diſcharge of his principal Devoi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This was the natural deſcription of Man, Now let us hear a deſcription of Choler.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Choler, ſays <hi>Seneca,</hi> is an impatient deſire of Revenge, a fervent and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate deſire of Ruine. She calls for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Weapons, delights in nothing but Blood, and runs headlong to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of others: When ſhe is onc upon the full ſpeed, neither Decency, nor the remembrance of paſt Benefits, nor the force of Friendſhip, nor the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Nature can ſtop her, but being deaf to all the Remonſtrances of Reaſon, nor able to diſcern either Truth or Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; She is wholly intent upon the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of her Fury, making oft-times no diſtinction between the Guilty and the Innocent, and frequently involving her ſelf in the Ruine of others.</q>
            </p>

            <p>This is ſo faithful a Portraicture of Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> depaints it himſelf al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt after the ſame manner. Choler, ſays he, hears Reaſon, but juſt like thoſe hair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brain'd Servants, that will not allow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Patience to underſtand what their Maſter ſays, and run headlong to obey their Commands, e'r they know what their Errand is. <q>It is alſo like thoſe Curs that bark at Friends and Foes alike, as ſoon as they knock at the Door.</q> Theſe Compariſons are true, and it is apparent to every one, that ſo ſoon as Reaſon has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven this impetuous Paſſion but a ſight of that Scorn or Contempt which ſhe has received, it preſently betakes it ſelf to Arms, never ſtaying till Reaſon has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the nature of the Injury, or what ſatisfaction ſhe expects.</p>
            <p>By theſe two indifferent Portraictures we may perceive how oppoſite Choler is to the Nature of Man, whoſe Inclinations lead him to the Comfort and Advantage
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:61588:72"/>
of thoſe who are like him in Creation, whereas Choler breaths nothing but their Damage and Deſtruction: So that in truth, unleſs we deny Man to be Man, we cannot preſume to ſay that a Vice ſo inhumane and pernicious is natural to him. Of which we may be fully convinc'd, if we do but conſider, that the Virtue which cures all the diſtempers of the Soul, and reſtores her to her Natural Condition, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dues her with a ſtrange abhorrency of doing evil to any one whatever. <q>The deſigning of Injury, ſays <hi>Plato,</hi> is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable with a Man of Worth; now it is the property of Anger to meditate Miſchief; therefore Anger is incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with a Man of Worth. Moreovel, ſays the Philoſopher, Choler rejoyces in the puniſhment of another, which is an affliction to a Perſon of Worth. To which we may add the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:61588:73"/>
him to bear with the wrongs which others do him. And that we may leave nothing unſaid upon this Subject, we muſt obſerve that a <hi>Wiſe</hi> Man, ſuch as <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and the greateſt of the Philoſophers repreſent him, never believes he receives an injury, and conſequently that he is no way oblig'd to Revenge.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Paripateties</hi> complain againſt the <hi>Stoics;</hi> alledging their accuſation to be unjuſt, that they uphold <hi>Anger.</hi> Since they only defend that Paſſion which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the Dictates of Reaſon, which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver kindl'd, but when it ought, and as much as it ought to be; and which in the reparation of Injuries never violates the Laws of Equity. But they complain with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a cauſe, and juſtify as weakly what is laid to their charge; for if there be any ſuch Paſſion in Man, which never ſhews it ſelf but by the Dictates of Reaſon; if there be any ſuch thing as Anger, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver pretends in doing miſchief, but one to the Correction and Profits of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, it only carries the Name of Anger, but precipitates nothing of its Nature; ſince it is the proper Character of Anger not to liſten to Reaſon, to withſtand it,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:61588:73"/>
and to delight in the puniſhment of him that does the Injury.</p>
            <p>However, ſome will ſay, this is no ſuch Paſſion, as is bred in the <hi>Iraſcible</hi> Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, Blind, Violent, and Frantick, and which for the ſlighteſt offences flies out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Rage and Fury. This is at the ſame time inform'd, ſoften'd and regulated by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and requires nothing from the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon injur'd, but that he take a Revenge ſuitable to the wrong received. I Anſwer, That if the Motive that excites us to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damage another, aims only at particular Profit, which is the end that Men propoſe in puniſhing, or the publick advantage, which is that of Miniſters of Juſtice, It is both juſt and reaſonable: But if it tend to the hurt of the Perſon; that is, if it be a deſire of Revenge, and to reap our ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction from the pain or vexation which the Party ſuffers, it is a Motive malicious, cruel, brutiſh, and no way becoming a Man. Now ſuch is Choler, by the very Confeſſion of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf. For he defines it to be, <q>A lively and importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate reſentment of the Injury done us, which cannot be appeaſed or ſeparated, but by the pleaſure of Revenge.</q> So that
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:61588:74"/>
let our Anger be abated to never ſo low a degree, yet ſo long as it is Anger, 'twill be a deſire of Revenge, and a Paſſion that rejoyces in the harm which another ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers.</p>
            <p>Having thus demonſtrated Choler to be evil in its Nature, it will be eaſy alſo to ſhew that it is as pernicious in its Effects, and that they who are moſt ſubject to it, are the firſt that feel their violence, as if it were againſt them that Anger ſeems to turn her Fury. For no ſooner is it kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Breaſts of thoſe Men, but it diſplays it ſelf in their Countenances, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbs and alters their Looks in an inſtant, brings all the Blood into the Faces of ſome, while others grow pale upon the ſame oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. The Eyes dart forth furious Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, a ſierce and wild Aſpect threatens all the World, and in a word, all the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſigns of Madneſs appear in the Perſon thus anger'd, which was the reaſon that the Ancients call'd it a ſhort Frenzie. We are really Fools, ſaid <hi>Philemon,</hi> as often as we are Angry.</p>
            <p>I forbear to tell how it diſorders the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Speech of thoſe who are maſter'd by it; I ſhall only ſay this, That Men other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:61588:74"/>
wary and prudent, when they are under the Controul of this Paſſion, utter many things contrary to Reaſon and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency. Which is ſo true, that <hi>Homer,</hi> ſo jealous of his <hi>Hero</hi>'s Honour, and leſt he ſhould ſay or do any thing to wound it, yet cannot forbear, when he repreſents <hi>Achilles</hi> in anger, to make him reproach <hi>Agamemn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n</hi> after a manner very ſcurrilous and unworthy, not only of a <hi>Hero,</hi> but of an ordinary Perſon.</p>
            <p>But let this ſuffice for the External Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures of a Perſon inflam'd with Choler: Let us but conſider the terrible Confuſion with which this Paſſion torments him within; the violence that tranſports him, the various Deſigns that agitate his Brain, the number of Thoughts that darken his Underſtanding, the ſundry Fancies and reſtleſs Deſires that peſter and intangle his Reſolutions, and we may eaſily perceive by the diſorder of his Soul, and by the various Emotions, which <hi>Plutarch</hi> calls his Convulſions, that ſhe is really diſlodged from the natural Seat of her Repoſe. And therefore we cannot apprehend why <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> ſhould affirm Pleaſure to be a more dangerous Evil than Choler, becauſe, ſays
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:61588:75"/>
he <q>That Choler gives Reaſon leave to ſpeak, and receives her Orders, thô it miſtake in the execution; whereas Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure inſinuates her ſelf into the Heart, and gets the Victory over it before Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can be conſulted.</q> For if ſuch an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor may be contradicted, rather quite the contrary is in truth to be made out: inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that the Philoſopher ſeems not to have underſtood the Nature of the Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of thoſe two Paſſions. For it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent that Anger is ſuddain and violent; Pleaſure leſs violent, and raſh; that Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler will not ſuffer Reaſon to meddle in the leaſt; whereas Pleaſure permits her to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate and judge, thô ſhe labours all the while to corrupt her Judgment.</p>
            <p>It now remains to ſhew, that Choler is of no uſe, and ſo far from being Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's Officer, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> calls it, that it only conſounds and betrays her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
            <p>The opinion of the <hi>Perip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>teticks, Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureans,</hi> and generally of all Philoſophers, who maintain Choler to be uſeful, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from another opinion of theirs, that Choler is as it were a Guardianeſs That Nature has provided for Man, to watch
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:61588:75"/>
over the preſervation of all his common and particular Rights, and inſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>res him both with a deſire and ſtrength to defend them. For, ſay they, this Paſſion en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables him to repel Injuries which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives from his Enemies, and arms him to ſuccour his Friends, his Kindred, and his Country; it aſſiſts Parents and Tutors in the Education of Youth, and Magiſtrates in the puniſhment of Crimes. That with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out her, Man would abandon his moſt important Duties, and prove unprofitable both to himſelf and others. Theſe are their moſt conſiderable Reaſons.</p>
            <p>But we deny, that Choler is aſſiſting to Man in the diſcharge of his principal Duties; in regard experience tells us, that the Paſſions uſually are the Principles of vertuous Actions, which man performs; of himſelf; and that this is the only foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation upon which the whole Machine moves. Only we ſay, that it was for want of obſerving the nature of Choler, that thoſe Philoſophers affirm'd it uſeful for the ſervice of Reaſon in private Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venges, in the puniſhment of Crimes, in the Chaſtizing of Servants and Children, and in magnanimous Actions. For that
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:61588:76"/>
which Anger has common with the other Paſſions, is to prevent the D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ctates of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and darken the Underſtanding; but the particular qualities of it are, to be moſt impetuous and violent, and not able to contain it ſelf. Which is evident in private Revenges, where a man to do himſelf an imaginary right, moſt mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrouſly violates the Rules of Juſtice; while nothing will ſerve him to waſh off a petty contempt, but the Blood of him that is by the Bonds of Nature ſo nearly related to him; ſometimes loſing his own Liſe to recover that which was never loſt. Which is the reaſon that God has reſerv'd Vengeance to himſelf; and that the Laws commit the reparation of Injuries only to the Impartial, that never receiv'd them.</p>

And what greater kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſaith <hi>Seneca,</hi> can he ſhew the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender, whoſe Life has been ſo prejudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, than to render his Death profitable, by putting an end to his Crimes, which he could not do himſelf?</p>

The ſame is to be ſaid for the chaſtiſing of Servants and Children; where Choler ſometimes will not permit us to obſerve any Moderation; and for that it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to exerciſe thoſe puniſhments in our Paſſion, but that we ſhall have ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon afterwards to repent our ſeverity. And therefore it is requiſite to delay thoſe chaſtiſements for ſome time after the Fault committed. <q>I would chaſtiſe thee, ſaid <hi>Socrates</hi> to his Servant, if I were not in wrath.</q>

little Treſpaſſes which they commit; the one for their diſobedience, the others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they do not ſerve us to our good liking. However, ought we not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, ſays <hi>Theophraſtus,</hi> that Anger may be ſerviceable to a good Man to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite his exclamations againſt the wicked? Upon this condition, anſwers <hi>Seneca,</hi> 
               <q>That the better he is, the more his Vertue ſhall encreaſe with his Anger. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, ſaith <hi>Plutarch,</hi> he ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd to be in a rage againſt thoſe that are already tranſported with Paſſion, and fall into the very fault which he reproves.</q> But <hi>Seneca</hi> adds, What can a vitious Man have in the perſons of thoſe that are vitious and irregular? Is it their proneneſs to Evil, and their unhappy Frailty? If ſo, he ought to be inflam'd againſt himſelf, as partaking of humane Infirmity with them. For if he do not acknowledge it in himſelf he is utterly miſtaken: and if he only blames it in others, he is unjuſt. Beſides, how vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous ſoever a Man may be, well he knows, that he is uſually eſteem'd much better than he is, and that the publick teſtimony is much more favourable to
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:61588:78"/>
him, than that of his own Conſcience. He knows well that he is ſubject to a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Infirmities; and how can he behold with Indignation the ſlips and failings of others, and cenſure 'em with Rigor, He who himſelf has need of their Indulgence? It is evident then, that the diſpoſition of Wiſe Men in reſpect of the wicked, can be no ſour and lofty diſpoſition, that puts 'em forward to reproach their evil Lives; but a diſpoſition mild and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, that pities their own miſcarriages and labours their Reformation. <q>The Spirit of Wiſdom is a loving Spirit, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Sacred Oracle of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

            <p>The laſt Reaſon that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> brings to prove the benefit of Anger, is this, For that the heat of Choler ſhares in all war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Atchievements. To which we An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That if a Great Commander has need of being animated with this Paſſion, to foreſee the deſigns of his Enemies to range his Army in Battalia, to give out his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to manage the Combat, and be him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:61588:78"/>
in the heat of the Conflict; we may thence conclude, that he cannot be vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, unleſs he be tranſported, and that he muſt be beſide himſelf to manage any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Enterprize. But for all that, we cannot but admire the General of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, who is always <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of himſelf in Fight, even when danger moſt ſurprizes him. For we find that the Valour not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Commanders, but of private Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers is moſt to be relyed on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and moſt equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prov'd, where it is leaſt boyling and precipitate. <q>Therefore, ſays <hi>Plutarch,</hi> the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> before they joyn Battel, order'd the Flutes and Cornets to play certain ſoft and melting Airs, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to temper the heat and fury of the Soldiers.</q> Laſtly, if we do but reflect upon thoſe barbarous People who have no other courage, then I know not what kind of natural Rage, that they never go to Fight in cold Blood, but as they are ſmitten with the Image of the Injury which they often have, or believe they have received, they fling themſelves into the thickeſt of the Enemy, without any Order or Government; but then it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens that notwithſtanding the ſtrength of
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:61588:79"/>
their Bodies, their ability to endure the rigors of all Seaſons, and the hardſhips of War, and notwithſtanding the fury of their Onſets, they are frequently van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh'd by People more tender and ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en'd by Luxury and Pleaſure. Story tells us, and every one knows after what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the Romans handled the <hi>Cimbrians,</hi> hideous for Bulk and Stature, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible for their Aſpects, who had already paſſed the <hi>Alps</hi> with an intention to Sack <hi>Rome,</hi> and ranſack all <hi>Italy,</hi> yet vanquiſh'd by <hi>Marius</hi> in ſeveral Great and Bloody Battels. So that if the natural Fury of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage People, be not ſufficient to make Men truly valiant, how ſhall we believe that Choler, no leſs Blind, no leſs Wild, and Impetuous ſhould be the Soul of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour?</p>
            <p>But whence then comes it to paſs, that the Poets call Courage a Noble and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Indignation, and that all the World takes Anger for Valour? It pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from hence, that Choler has certain Qualities that reſemble Valour. Firſt, it is Raſh, and thence they believe it Active: It is Obſtinate, and that paſſes for Stout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: 'Tis Terrible, and that renders it
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:61588:79"/>
Formidable; and then it is boldly Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, which makes People imagine it to be Couragious. <q>The Vulgar, ſays <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca,</hi> take thoſe that are inflam'd with Choler, for perſons brave and couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</q>
            </p>
            <p>A Second Cauſe of this miſtake is this, That the vehemence of Choler is taken for the ſtrength of the Soul; whereas on the other ſide, it is a demonſtrative proof of its weakneſs; for this ſame Paſſion growing in the Soul like a Tempeſt, rears it up, and drives it impetuouſly to and fro; So that altho to outward appearance the Soul may ſeem to act with vigor and ſtrength, it is really a violent Force that tumbles and toſſes her like an anger'd Sea. Which is more manifeſtly diſcover'd from hence; that Choler more eaſily gets the Maſtery of Women than Men; of the Sick People than Healthy; of Age, than Youth; of Men that live in Plenty and ſoftned by Delights, than of the unfortunate har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den'd by Perſecutions and Adverſities.</p>
            <p>As to what the Peripateticks affirm, that Anger is ſerviceable to Eloquence, there can be nothing more weak and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; and to which it will be ſufficient to
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:61588:80"/>
anſwer with <hi>Cicero,</hi> 
               <q>That it is enough for an Orator to appear in a Paſſion, but there is no neceſſity he ſhould be really angry; and it is ſo far from being neceſſary, that he ſhould be in paſſion, that it is a dangerous thing for him to be ſo; ſince the perfection of Eloquence, according to <hi>Quintilian,</hi> conſiſts in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all that he ought to ſpeak, and not in ſpeaking preciſely no more than he ought; but that Choler never ſpeaks as it ought to ſpeak<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but always that which it ought not.</q> Therefore <hi>Caius Gracchus,</hi> a Great Orator, yet one that chaſ'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo immoderately in Talking, that he ſometimes confounded himſelf by chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Tone of his Voice, had one of his Servants alway ſtanding behind him, who when his Voice was out of Tune, Tun'd it again by means of a certain Inſtrument formerly us'd to keep the Voice to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant pitch.</p>
            <p>In the Second place we anſwer, That there is a great difference between the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemence of an Orator, and that of Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler. The Firſt is nothing but the ſtrength of Reaſon forcibly expreſſed by Words, by the Tune of the Voice, and agreeable
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:61588:80"/>
Geſtures: and this Vehemence never fails of making an impreſſion and perſwading. The Second tranſports an Orator, troubles, diſtracts, diſorders his Geſture and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and by that means conveying his own diſorder into the Minds of the Hearers, puts 'em all in a hurry and confuſion; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that it is ſo unacceptable, that it alienates the affection of the Hearers.</p>
            <p>Now if we have a mind to view the Rock againſt which Renowned <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſo deſperately ſplits himſelf, he diſcovers it to us himſelf, where he ſays, <q>That we are to conſider the Paſſions as the Arms of Vertue. And where he ſays farther, That we are to make uſe of Choler, as of a Soldier, and never ſuffer it to Command within us, or do the Office of a Captain.</q> Whence it is viſible this Great Philoſopher thought that Men might weild their Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler like a Sword, which we take up, or lay down, thruſt forward, or draw back as we pleaſe our ſelves; which is a very great Error, ſince there is no perſon ſo ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid, who does not perceive that if the Paſſions be Arms, they are Weapons that Fight of themſelves, as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſays, and of which we may affirm Man to be ſo little
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:61588:81"/>
the Maſter, that on the contrary they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther keep Man in ſubjection. As for what he ſays, that Reaſon ought to take upon her the Conduct of Anger; he ſuppoſes there that Reaſon is ſeparated from Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, that ſhe conſiders its Emotions in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and ſecurity, and that they have Seats apart; whereas they are both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Soul. And therefore ſo ſoon as the Paſſion of Anger is kindled, it tranſports the Soul, and extinguiſhes within her the ſight of Reaſon. So that all that Reaſon can do, is to employ all her Induſtries to prevent its growth; for, if ſhe ſuffer Choler once to get a head ſhe evidently endangers her ſeit, to be at the mercy of that powerful and imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Paſſion.</p>
            <p>It is alſo certain that Reaſon knows how to make a good uſe of Choler in regard it is the Natural Property of Choler to deprive Man of the uſe of Reaſon; And for that this Paſſion is too blind, and too violent to be under Conduct; beſides that, the deſire of Miſchief and Revenge is inſeparable from its Nature. But it is not ſo with Zeal, which animates all true Chriſtians, to which the Holy Fathers
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:61588:81"/>
have ſometime given the Name of <hi>Anger,</hi> tho it ariſe from the Senſitive Appetite, as it is there produc'd by the Love of God, in whoſe Service it is but juſt that all the Powers of the Soul ſhould be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd: and let it be never ſo forcible or vehement, its ſtrength and vehemence are ſtill obedient to the Dictates of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. A zealous Preacher cries out vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently againſt Sinners, but he is no way exaſperated againſt 'em, nor doth he carry any Animoſities in his Heart, while he reproves and reproaches them in his Words. On the other ſide, when Men are in Anger, they chide and puniſh with Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſity; and at the ſame time that they diſcharge themſelves from theſe obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Charity, they wrong tender Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue every hour. Therefore ſaith St. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin,</hi> 
               <q>The moſt quick-ſighted Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, and whoſe Opinions approach neareſt to Truth, believe that Choler is abſolutely evil, becauſe, ſay they, the ſlighteſt Emotions of it are malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and irregular, and that forces us to ſin againſt Reaſon at the very time, when we do that which Reaſon commands us: We ought to have the ſame opinion of all
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:61588:82"/>
the Humane Paſſions, adds the Holy Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor; They reſemble that Selve-Love that gives 'em Birth; they are vehement diſorderly, and vicious like that; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Fears and Joys, the Sorrows, and other Paſſions of Chriſtians that derive themſelves from Charity, are Peaceable, Mild, Prudent, and Moderate.</q>
            </p>
            <p>If Human Paſſions then be ſo contrary to Reaſon, that it is impoſſible that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhould be ſerviceable to 'em, we may eaſily conclude, That it is not the office of Mildneſs to reduce Choler to that point of Moderation, ſet down by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> to which ſo ſoon as it is reduced, becomes virtuous; but to withſtand all its Emoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſo to extinguiſh 'em, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing may be able to re-kindle 'em. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Mildneſs can never be ſufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll'd, if the ſame Mildneſs, of which ſome Perſons make a ſhew in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, were a real Vertue, and if it effectually carried off the tartneſs and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tetneſs of Choler, whereas it only ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly removes it, as I am going to make out.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:61588:82"/>
If we had a true Idea of the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Man, or if we knew that he is poſſeſſed with a Self-Love altogether vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent and erroneous, and that this Self-Love renders him impetuous, wild, and inhuman; the knowledge of this would ſpare us the trouble of ſhewing that <hi>Mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> is no real Vertue, ſince no body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deceiv'd by the ſeeming Mildneſs of a Perſon, that never was tranſported with Paſſion in his Life, all Men would judge of him as of a Lyon, which we ſtill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve to be fierce and cruel, tho we ſee him to be gentle and obedient to his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor; and would be ſo far from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing ſuch a perſon Mild and Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that they would think it ſufficient to ſay he was <hi>Tam'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what is it that has the Power to tame a Man? Either the Kindneſs that is done him, or the Benefit which he hopes to receive: which is apparent from hence, that the Favourites of Kings and Princes, and all Servants that are particularly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved by their Maſters, ſuffer their croſs Humors, and ſometimes their Rebukes and Repulſes with an extraordinary Mildneſs, ſo that that which makes it appear that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:61588:83"/>
Mildneſs is only a Violence put upon their natural Inclinations is this, That at the ſame time that they ſhew themſelves ſo Mild to thoſe upon whom their whole Fortune depends, they unchain themſelves againſt all others, like tamed Lyons that only quit their wildneſs in the preſence of their Governors that feed 'em.</p>
            <p>This ſame Mildneſs proceeds alſo very frequently from the fear of being put to ſhame. For Pride, which inflames Man with a continual deſire to make himſelf the Maſter of others, cauſes him to be aſham'd every time that he finds himſelf tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Choler, and that it appears he is not Maſter of himſelf.</p>
            <p>Sometimes <hi>Mildneſs</hi> is only a vain and ambitious deſire to triumph over a violent Paſſion, that triumphs over the moſt part of Man; which ſort of Vanity is to be met with in Magiſtrates, in Philoſophers, and all thoſe that labour for Moderation, and would be thought prudent Perſons.</p>
            <p>In other Perſons <hi>Mildneſs</hi> is a deſire to gain to themſelves the Love of all Men, particularly of thoſe with whom they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociate. For there are ſome Vertues, as Valour, Generoſity, and Magnanimity,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:61588:83"/>
which give us admiſſion into the Breaſts of Men, and fix us in their Eſteem; others, as <hi>Mildneſs</hi> and Goodneſs which open their Hearts, and attract their Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
            <p>Love of Peace and Repoſe obliges ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny People engaged in Marriage, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain their natural Ardor and Impatiency, and to imitate the Manners and Cuſtoms of Mild and Moderate Perſons, becauſe they find no better way to keep Peace at home, than to give their Wives, their Children, and their Servants a good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
            <p>Mildneſs in Diſpute is a ſecret deſire we have to vanquiſh our Opponents, which is an effect of our experience, that Heat in Diſputes troubles and confounds the Judgment, which is the reaſon we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to chaſe our ſelves; to the end, that being in perfect poſſeſſion of our ſelves, we may be able to explain our ſelves with clearneſs and force, which is the moſt probable way to prevail. The ſame is to be ſaid of Mildneſs in Negotiations; For it is a Moderation which we never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, but only to get an advantage over thoſe with whom we n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>te, which is
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:61588:84"/>
a cunning kind of coolneſs which certain ſtout Men obſerve in Duels, by which they take time and leiſure, and watch their opportunity to thruſt home. Signeur <hi>Contarini,</hi> Ambaſſador in <hi>France.</hi> to this Coldneſs added an apparent Indifferency, inſomuch that ſometimes he would ſit all the whole time of the Conference with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpeaking a word to the buſineſs he came about: When they waited on him to his Coach, he ſpoke of it as of a thing which he had forgotten, and treated as he went down Stairs. But the Duke <hi>d'Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vares</hi> made uſe of a ſtratagem quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to ſtudied Mildneſs; for he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd by counterfeit, and meditated heats to put the Perſons in diſorder with whom he negotiated.</p>
            <p>The Mildneſs of Princes (who when they have it in their power to puniſh with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ile or impriſonment, ſuch as go beyond the bounds of Reſpect and Duty, paſs by their indiſcretion and inſolence with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any notice, or expreſſion of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure) in ſuch as are Men of parts, is no more than a politick Mildneſs. Such was that of <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon,</hi> who ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd himſelf to be revil'd, even in his
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:61588:84"/>

Which being told <hi>Philip</hi> by the ſame C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>urtiers, that before had ſolicited his death, Do you not ſee, ſaid He, What an excellent Phyſician I am to cure a ray<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ing Tongue. <hi>Auguſtus</hi> alſo would never ſuffer any enquiry to be made after the Authors of thoſe ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Libels that were diſpers'd in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, full of Reproach and Calumnies againſt him. For which <hi>Tiberius</hi> blaming him, he made anſwer, <q>Thou argu'ſt like a young Man, let 'em alone to talk as much evil of me as they pleaſe, 'tis ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient that I have reduc'd 'em to ſuch a condition, that they are able to do me none.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides theſe ſorts of <hi>Mildneſs,</hi> there is alſo a vertuous Mildneſs; for they who are naturally inclin'd to Mildneſs are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſo; whereas they whoſe Mildneſs is a
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:61588:85"/>
quality acquir'd by Study, are frequently tranſported with the vertue of their Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Nevertheleſs we do not obſerve that natural <hi>Mildneſs</hi> is no hindrance to thoſe that are Maſters of it, but that they are ſenſible of the injury which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from the hatred of thoſe that ſeek their diſturbance, and are deſirous of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, ſo that they are carried away with the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>artneſs and malignity of Choler, thô they are able to bridle their Tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Which is manifeſt from hence, that perſons who are of a cold and moiſt Complexion, and never ſubject to anger, yet notwithſtanding all their reſerv'dneſs cannot forbear tart and biting expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt thoſe from whom they receive abuſes, and to take ſmart revenges upon thoſe that offer the injury; So that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Mildneſs is only the peaceable and quiet behaviour of the outward Man.</p>
            <p>And therefore Chriſtian Mildneſs alone has the only priviledge to calm and paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Minds of thoſe that are provok'd by Injuries and Affronts. For that is it which prevents the Inſurrections of Choler and Revenge, which makes a conſiderable dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between Mildneſs and Patience.
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:61588:85"/>
For a patient Man ſtrives with all his might to ſupport with mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>muring the injuries done him; but he that exerciſes Mildneſs according to the Rules of the Goſpel, does no wrong; nor does he believe that others do him any when they perſecute him; perſwading himſelf, that being a ſinner he deſerves the harſheſt and moſt rigorous vexations that can befall him; in ſomuch that we may ſay, That Mildneſs is the perfection of Patience.</p>
            <p>Now that we may underſtand how <hi>Mildneſs</hi> operates theſe wonderful Effects in the Soul, we muſt enquire into the cauſes of Choler. <hi>Plutaroh,</hi> who perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtood this Paſſion, obſerves, that it draws its Original from Pride and Self-Love. Pride furniſhes it with fierceneſs, its Inflation, and impetuoſity of Motion; and Self-Love ſupplies it with a Million of occaſions that give it growth and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment. Pride cauſes thoſe ſorts of Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler which are rare, but cruel, implacable, and ſanguinary. Thoſe ſorts of Choler which are kindl'd by Self-Love, are leſs malicious, and more eaſily appeas'd, but they are more troubleſome and more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent. <q>There is, ſaith <hi>Soneca,</hi> a nice
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:61588:86"/>
ſort of Anger, which proceeds from a ſower and difficult Humor:</q> Now altho this ſower and difficult Humor be in ſome perſons an effect of Bodily Temperament, in others, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> has obſerved, it derives it ſelf from Self-Love, very nice, and very dainty. For as it cauſes an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite number of inconveniences, as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires much care and obſervance, ſo is it very difficult to be ſatisfied, which is the reaſon that it is continually bemoaning and vexing it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Therefore that Vertue which encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and utterly defeats Choler, muſt firſt aſſail and deſtroy our Pride and Self-Love. And this is that which begets Chriſtian Mildneſs, becauſe it is an effect of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility; not of that Humility which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in modeſt Looks and poſtures of the countenance, which is no more than Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocryſie and a continued Lye; but of Humility and lowlineſs in Heart, as our Saviour calls it. For that Humility is the cauſe, that Chriſtians acknowledging themſelves to be ſinners, are ſo convinc'd, that they deſerve the ſcorn of the World, that tho they ſhould be trampled under foot, they would not think they had any
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:61588:86"/>
reaſon to complain. It diſpoſes 'em like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to ſuffer chearfully the Privation, not only of all their Comforts and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies, but of things neceſſary for the ſupport of Life. So that whatever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls 'em to their damage or diſquiet, they are contented in all conditions.</p>

            <p>LOwneſs of Fortune is ſuch a Shame to Human Pride, that there is nothing a Man will not invent or do to retrieve himſelf from the Imbaſement of a mean Condition. Therefore we find, that they who are born of obſcure Parents labour to exalt themſelves by Places and Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; or make uſe of all manner of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes, to have a ſhare in the Favour and Confidence of Great Men; that they may be taken notice of, and that having no Greatneſs of their own, they may be aggrandiz'd by the Grandeur of another. This is that which hurries ſuch infinite Numbers of People to the Palaces of Princes; 'tis not their Love nor their Affection to thoſe Grandees to whom they ſacrifice their Service and Attendance.</p>
            <p>But becauſe the high Quality of Men in the firſt ſtation of Grandeur renders

them inacceſſible to the Ambitious that are of mean Extraction, who neither dare or can approach their awful Preſence, either out of fear or reſpect, they are overjoy'd when ſome paces are advanc'd to make an approach eaſie.</p>

            <p>True it is, that Affability is a Charm, whoſe Force it is a difficult matter to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand; but as true it is on the other ſide, that the Uſe which is now made of it,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:61588:88"/>
plainly demonſtrates it to be no real Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. For the Grandees<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that practiſe it moſt innocently, or to ſay better, leaſt criminally, exerciſe it only out of a lofty Pride; that is, to fill their Palaces with their Admirers, which they look upon as a pompous mark of the Grandeur of their Credit or their Deſcent.</p>
            <p>I ſay then, that the leaſt evil ſort of Affability is that of Great Perſonages, that affect to invite numerous Trains to their Courts only to gratifie their Vanity. For the greater Part make uſe of this Vertue to carry on the deſigns of their Ambition. And theſe, how affable and civil ſoever they may appear in reference to the whole Court, they are kind and affable after another manner in reſpect to thoſe perſons that abide there in a good condition, and may be uſeful to 'em in gaining thoſe high<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Preferments and Advantages to which they pretend.</p>
            <p>But Affability is not only Vain and Ambitious; it is alſo Malicious and Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Such was the Affability of <hi>Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom. That young Prince,</hi> ſays the Scripture, <hi>ſpoke to all that enter'd into his Father's Palace;</hi> ask'd 'em, whence they came?
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:61588:88"/>
what buſineſs brought 'em thither? And when he had heard their Anſwers, he commended the Juſtice of their Cauſes, and offer'd his Interceſſion, By theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſt ations of Goodneſs labouring to gain and ſeduce them.</p>
            <p>This Example not only ſhews us the Malignity of this Artificial and Craſty Vertue, but how it is alſo particularly devoted to the deſigns of Uſurpers and Rebels, and that it is principally to be met with in the Heads of Factions. For beſides, that they have no other way, but by their great Care and Induſtry, to oblige the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Adherence of their Friends and Confederates, who are uſually tempted and frequently overcome by the Allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the contrary Party, it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible they ſhould ſucceed without the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Multitude. So that it behoves them to court all ſorts of People, civilly to entertain all Comers and Goers, and after they have ſpent the Night in making ſure of their Friends by all manner of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes, to waſte the Day in fawning upon the miſerable Boutefeu's, who are in cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit and eſteem among the People; which occaſion'd that Saying of <hi>Pindar, That</hi>

            <p>Vertuous Affability proceeds from Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Humility, and is never to be found but in a Perſon truly Chriſtian. For while the Pride of his Condition tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports him to diſdain all the reſt of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, Humility inſpires him with ſuch mean ſentiments of himſelf, that he is ſtill ready to receive with a free and open countenance all men that he knows are like by Nature, and whom is he apt to believe more vertuous than himſelf.

            <p>THE Life of Man is ſubject to many Evils, Misfortunes, and Croſſes, that it would be always conſum'd in vexation and diſcontent, if Men were not ſenſible of their trouble, and took care to eaſe it. But Providence has provided for his Relief, after a wonde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ful manner, by the different obligations which he has ſcatter'd among Men. For theſe obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions engage 'em to intereſt themſelves in what concerns them, and mutually to aſſiſt each other. For which reaſon it is, that through the Wiſdom of Providence ſeveral are bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>me Blood, to the end the Good which they are able to do may communicate it ſelf to their Kindred and Relations, before Strangers; as the Juice that ſupports the Life of a Tree, diſtributes it ſelf to the Branches next its Body ſooner than to thoſe that are at a
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:61588:90"/>
diſtance. Beſides, the ſame Providence infuſes into certain perſons ſuch a Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of temper, that they contract a Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſo ſoon as they know one another; and that union begets an obligation to ſhare in each others Troubles, and to aſſiſt each other in all their Neceſſities. But as Proximity of Blood extends only to a ſmall number of People, and for that Friendſhip is alſo more ſtraitly confin'd, the moſt part of Men in miſery would be abandon'd, if the ſame Providence had not found out the ſecret to join them to the moſt happy by Nature which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to both. For it is impoſſible but that being naturally united, they muſt be ſenſible of the Sufferings of others, and being ſo ſenſible, they muſt do what lies in their power for their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.</p>
            <p>This is the Priviledg of Pity and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeration, That they ſet no bounds in relieving perſons whom they love; they lend their aſſiſtance to perſons the moſt indifferent, even to thoſe that have not deſerv'd it, nay to their very Enemies. Pity is the Refuge of all in Miſery; and therefore we have reaſon to beſtow on
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:61588:90"/>
her the higheſt Encomiums, if they who are charitable to the Poor, and relieve the Diſtreſſed, do thoſe good Offices from a true Piety and love of God. But our Self-Love, that corrupts and taints all the Good we do, will not let us be ſenſible of the Miſeries of our Neighbour, nor does it inſpire us with a deſire to relieve their Neceſſities, but only for a private intereſt to our ſelves, as we ſhall plainly make out.</p>
            <p>There are few People that Study the Nature of Self-Love, tho it be one of the moſt profitable pieces of Knowledg that we can acquire; ſince without it we cannot diſtinguiſh the fallacious from the pure and real Vertues. For Self-Love is of a wonderful extent, in regard that all who are ſway'd by it, are diſturb'd and troubl'd, for the Subjects they are near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt concern'd in, or elſe for ſuch wherein they have little or no Intereſt: they have the ſaid fear for Accidents which are never like to happen, as for thoſe wherewith they are threaten'd: and inſtead of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting themſelves, to apply remedies to their preſent Miſeries, they employ their
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:61588:91"/>
whole care to prevent future Misfortunes and Calamities.</p>
            <p>Theſe which are the diſpoſitions of Men full of Self-Love, ſufficiently ſhew us, by what Princip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e they act, who act by the motives of Pity purely Human; and that when they open their Purſes to relieve a Perſon who is fallen to decay; or that they ſave him from going to Jayl a poor Debtor purſued by his Creditors; or that they ſhew themſelves officious in the relief of their Neighbours, o'rwhelm'd with Sickneſs and Sorrow; or that they ſtrive to comfort a Father or Mother for the loſs of an only Son; thô their Actions perſwade us, that they have a real compaſſion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Afflictions and Miſeries of their Neighbours; they are perſons who have no Pity but upon themſelves, whom they ſerve, aſſiſt, and relieve in the perſons of others, and wipe from their own, the Tea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s which they ſeem to wipe from the Eyes of their Neighbours, and their Friends. There are People who finding that through the Inconſtancy of Human Affairs, the Wealthy are in a ſhort time impoveriſh'd by ill Fortune; that the moſt ſtrong, and
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:61588:91"/>
moſt healthy when they leaſt dream of it' are attacked by tedious and incurable Diſeaſes; and that the moſt happy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come often the Objects of Fortunes Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred; take all the care they can of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate, to the end that others may take the ſame compaſſion upon them, ſhould the ſame caſualties befall <hi>Them.</hi> So that they prevent all their neceſſities, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford themſelves before-hand, all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief they can imagine: So that Pity is a Sentiment ſecretly intereſted, a politick Foreſight, or more properly the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Self-Love.</p>
            <p>The Tears which <hi>Ceſar</hi> ſhed when <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odorus</hi> preſented him with <hi>Pomp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y</hi>'s Head, clearly demonſtrates this to be a Truth. For it is evident that he wept at the ſight of that Spectacle, out of a certain appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion that Fortune who had betrayed <hi>Pompey,</hi> might prove as unfaithful to Him; And that the number and continuance of the Favours which he received from him, were but a fore boding Omen of her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy: For if he had bewail'd the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable end of <hi>Pompey,</hi> out of the leaſt remainder of Friendſhip that he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for him; would he not have teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:61588:92"/>
a real abhorrency of an Aſſaſſination committed upon ſo great a Perſonage, and would he not have puniſhed the <hi>Aſſaſſin</hi> whom he had in his Power? But how could he be truly afflicted at a Murther that had deliver'd him from ſo formidable an Enemy, and ſecur'd him the Empire? <q>In truth, ſays <hi>Quintus Curtius,</hi>They have little experience of the Heart of Man, who expect compaſſion from thence, or think that the Misfortunes of others go ſo near their Hearts, as to draw Tears from their Eyes.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Idea</hi> which I have conceiv'd of Pity, is conformable to the Definition which I have given of it. Pity, ſays he, Is a Sorrow, which we conceive for the Misfortunes and Afflictions that happen to others, out of miſtruſt that they may one day befall our ſelves; Now if any one deſires to be convinc'd that it is this Miſtruſt from whence our Pity ſprings let him but obſerve, that it is rarely to be found among thoſe that are laden with Wealth and Honour, and who are fix'd in their Proſperity; or among that ſort of miſerable People, who are overwhelm'd with Calamity, that there remains no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:61588:92"/>
more for them to fear. Therefore we have great reaſon to wonder, that Pity ſhould be lookt upon as a vertuous Quality; much more when we conſider that there is nothing to be valu'd in the Cauſes that produce it, or the Subjects wherein we uſually meet with it.</p>
            <p>Pity in it ſelf is but a mollifying of the Soul, which Vertue inc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſſantly labours to fortify; ſo that it is chiefly for Pity's ſake, that <hi>Plato</hi> condemns Dramatick Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. <q>There they repreſent, ſays he, Tragical Adventures, and bring us He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro's upon the Stage, complaining and bewalling their misfortunes, to move the Spectators Pity; not conſidering that being thus mollify'd, they are much more apt to be caſt down by Afflictions. Ought they not rather then to have propoſed Us Af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lictions proper to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm and ſtrengthen the Soul, and to have brought upon the Theater ſuch great Perſons as bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e their Loſſes and Misfortunes with a Generous Equality, and Conſtancy of Mind?</q> True it is, that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is not of his Opinion, believing Dramatick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Poetry to be a lively and natural Imitation and Portraiture of the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:61588:93"/>
Paſſions, to make Men either fear or avoid 'em. A ſingular Remedy indeed, and a ſtrange Undertaking, to pretend to cure Paſſions by Paſſions.</p>
            <p>As to the productive Cauſes of Pity, there are Two in chief, The Firſt is exceſs of Self-Love, which is the reaſon that Man extending his Proſpect through the whole courſe of his Life, ſearches out for Remedies for all the Accidents that may befall him.</p>
            <p>The cauſe of Pity is the mixture of Humors, where Phlegme predominates. For moiſt perſons are apter than others to receive the impreſſions of Objects; and they weep the more eaſily, becauſe they find ſome eaſe in ſhedding Tears. Hence it comes to paſs, that they who are of this temper, are not always alike ſenſible of it; and that there are ſome times and hours of the day that they little perceive it, as Phlegme p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>edominates more or leſs. So that we muſt not look upon that for Bread or Relief, which is merely given by the Commiſſion of Nature.</p>
            <p>The Subjects that are moſt ſuſceptible of Pity, are Old Men. Women and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, who are all Subjects, weak and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:61588:93"/>
to be mov'd; Old Men, becauſe their Minds and Bodies are enfeebled by Age; Children, becauſe they act by the impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which thoſe Objects that ſtrike the Senſes, imprint therein; And Women, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their Sex doth not admit 'em to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments that awaken and exerciſe their Courage; And beſide, they want Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Knowledge which fortifies the Mind; ſo that when bad Accidents befall 'em, they have neither Strength nor Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution: And for this reaſon they extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bemoan all thoſe that they behold in durance, and that they would, if they might, ſays <hi>Seneca,</hi> knock off their Shackles, and ſet open the Priſon Doors.</p>
            <p>So that altho all Men have a kindneſs for tender-hearted Perſons, tho the whole World be anticipated in favour of Pity, yet we muſt beware how we take it for a vertuous Quality; rather we ought to look upon it as a real Paſſion, as it is reckon'd to be by the conſent of all Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers. True it is, that <hi>Ariſto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>le</hi> ranks it in the number of thoſe Paſſions which he calls profitable and neceſſary; For he believing that all Generous Actions, and Noble Sciences are beholding for their
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:61588:94"/>
Original to Ambition: that deſire of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality made ſo many Hero's and Great Men Famous in all Arts and Sciences; that Choler aids the valiant, and ſhares in all warlike Atchievements; that Fear cauſes us to foreſee Miſchief, and is a matter of Prudence; believes in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that Pity excites us to ſupply the wants of the Poor, and to be liberal up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all occaſions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cicero</hi> cannot reliſh this Opinion, and laughs at <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> for affirming, That Man could not be Charitable, were he not mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify'd by Pity. <q>Man, ſays he, would be very unfortunate, if there were a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity that he ſhould be miſerable, that he might relieve the Unfortunate; or that nothing but a diſturb'd or troubl'd Soul could ſuccor the Indigent. Or as if he could not, ſays <hi>Seneca,</hi> relieve the Afflicted, without being caſt down, lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing and ſad like them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But is not Pity, then, the uſual Promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of that Charity, which we exerciſe towards our Neighbour? There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more certain, Anſwers <hi>Cic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ro.</hi> But the Queſtion is not, How Men perform thoſe actions which are laudable and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous in themſelves, but how they ought
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:61588:94"/>
to be done, and what is the diſpoſition of a Wiſe Man, when he relieves thoſe that are in neceſſity. Now the diſpoſition of a prudent Man is ſuch, that he does good by the calm dictates of Reaſon, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſtays till he be excited thereto by his Paſſions; So that the more he encreaſes in Wiſdom, the leſs need he has to be mov'd by his compaſſion to ſuccor the Poor; becauſe the Command of Reaſon is a ſufficient motive to him to do acts of Charity. This diſpoſition of a Wiſe Man proceeds from hence; That the forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er he advances in Vertue, the more like he becomes to God, who without being mov'd with the pains of them that ſuffer, delivers 'em by the ſole Dictates of his Prudence: And that which gives us ſome reaſon to ſuſpect, ſays St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> That Pity is the weakneſs and infirmity of our Nature; that the bleſſed Angels pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Men from Shipwrack, altho they feel no motion of Compaſſion, riſing from the danger wherein they ſee him. And therefore it was, <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaid, A Wiſe Man ought to be always charitable, but not always weak.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:61588:95"/>
Now if we would underſtand how it comes to paſs, that Men have ſuch a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for thoſe that are ſenſible of the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes of others, and why Pity has found advancement among the Qualities of high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt value? I Anſwer, That Men have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd an advantageous Opinion of Pity for the ſame reaſon that perſwaded the <hi>Babylonians</hi> that <hi>Belus</hi> was a God; for as they had that belief, and paid him Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Honors, becauſe they found his Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to be a Sanctuary for Criminals, ſo the vulgar ſeeing Pity to be the Refuge of the Miſerable, have eſteem'd, and honor'd it as a Divine Quality; By which we ſee, that Intereſt is not only the Original of all fallacious Verues, but is alſo the cauſe of that Eſteem and Vertue which we put upon 'em.</p>
            <p>Pity is applauded through that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream averſion which Men have to Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which is a quality altogether ſtrange and oppoſite to the Nature of Man; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſtifles within him all Sentiments of Humanity; and ſeems to ſhut his Heart againſt all other Men, by rend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible of their afflictions and miſeries. We may alſo ſay that ſeeing Severity is a
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:61588:95"/>
Vice that hinders Men from mutuall Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathizing in their Sorrows and Afflictions; it is a commendable thing to be ſenſible of the Miſeries which we are obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve: but there we muſt ſtop; for if we go a ſtep further, and draw this Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence from thence, That the Pity which we have for others meerly out of Self-Love, is a vertuous Quality; we begin to go aſtray, becauſe the Sentiments that Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue inſpires, are peaceable, uniform, and free from Intereſt; and for that Natural Compaſſion is a Sentiment unquiet, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal, and byaſs'd by Intereſt; ſo that it is a quite different thing to be mov'd with Pity, and to be mollify'd by Charity. Charity re-eſtabliſhes the power of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in Man, Pity weakens it; Charity makes him always ſenſible, and cauſes him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, to the beſt of his ability, the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of all Men, Friends Enemies, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, Strangers, as alſo thoſe that are abſent. Pity carries him no farther to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, than he is expoſed thereto by preſent Objects. Charity conſiders our Duty to God in relieving our Neighbour; Pity is only mov'd with Temporal Miſeries and Misfortunes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:61588:96"/>
We muſt however acknowledge, that thô Pity be in it ſelf no more than a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Soul, and tho the inducements to it are no way to be commended, yet that it is to be valu'd for its Effects; for it occaſions an infinite number of good Deeds in the World, which would never be done without it. So that when I have diſcovered the effects of it, my intention was not abſolutely to condemn it, and to find fault with the ſuccor which we give to our Neighbour by its Incitements; ſince it behoves us to approve all good Actions, by whatever imperfect Principle they are produc'd. My deſign was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore only to undeceive thoſe People, who believe they are vertuouſly tender and charitable, every time that out of their Natural Compaſſion they take poor People into their Houſes, or pay the Ranſome of any Captive: And to let 'em underſtand that no Man is vertuous, but when he acts out of a vertuous diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, according to that Maxim of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> He is not vertuous, let his vertuous Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be never ſo great, who does not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake 'em out of a vertuous Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:61588:96"/>
So that if there be any Chriſtians, as doubtleſs there are a great Number, who do not find in themſelves this vertuous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, this Exhortation may not be unſeaſonable; That if all People that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to God, are not yet ſo dear to 'em, as for them to ſymyathize in their Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Afflictions, or be thought worthy of their Sighs; Let 'em however follow the Sentiments of Nature, which binding 'em with the common tye of Affection to all other Men, obliges them to participate of their Troubles. Oh let 'em do that, through the motives of Pity, which they cannot do for the ſake of God and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity!</p>

The word <hi>Generoſity</hi> is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the proof of what I aſſert; It is a Word in good requeſt, it pleaſes the Ear, and Men have affix'd to it a very fair <hi>Idea.</hi> And yet it is not ſufficient, when made uſe of, as it is by many ſorts of People, eſpecially by thoſe who not having been bred at Court, pretend ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs to ſpeak more politely than the Vulgar; For we obſerve that they give this Name to all manner of Actions and Vertues Illuſtrious and Extraordinary. Whereas it properly ſignifies that Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:61588:97"/>
Vertue only that triumphs over Revenge, when it it is in our Power to take our ſatisfaction, inclines us to make a good uſe of all the advantages offer'd to us, over thoſe that profeſs themſelves our Enemies upon all occaſions, and ſpare for no Induſtry to do Us Miſchief.</p>
            <p>If we conſider the Vertues, as they are ranked in our Eſtimation, we ſhall find that we prefer all thoſe Vertues which we cannot practiſe without offering great violence to our Sentiments, before thoſe which we practiſe eaſily, or elſe as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd thereto by our Natural Inclinations. And therefore Valour, which is the reaſon that Man expoſes himſelf to continual dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and that he ſurmounts the reſiſtance of Nature, is eſteem'd quite after another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner than <hi>Goodneſs, Hoſpitality,</hi> or Humanity, to which he is inclin'd of himſelf, and of which he performs all the Duties without any reward, ſtrugling, or contention.</p>
            <p>For this reaſon it is that they have pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Generoſity among the moſt excellent Vertues; for that there is none that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a greater Force of the Soul, or which encounters within us, a ſmarter reluctancy, or more obſtacles to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:61588:98"/>
For what a great Command muſt a victorious Captain have over himſelf, who having vanquiſhed and taken a fierce and Inſolent Enemy, who had provok'd and defy'd him in ſeveral Encounters, entertains him nevertheleſs, not only with Mildneſs and Humanity, but with all the Civility and Handſomneſs imaginable? Muſt not alſo he be a great Maſter of his Reſentments, who favours thoſe that have caus'd him to waſte the beſt part of his Eſtate through their quarrelſome and liti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious vexations, when after the loſs of their ſuit ſo unjuſtly commenc'd, it lies in his power to ruine 'em? Laſtly, we muſt acknowledge that we have need of a great deal of good Nature to pardon a Perſon that has offer'd us a bloody Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front, when his Misfortune delivers him into our power, and that we have an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy opportunity to revenge our ſelves. And that which advances the Power of Generoſity upon all occaſions, is this, that beſides that, the Power of Revenge is ſo ſweet, that it is a difficult thing for a Man to ſurmount its Temptations; and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally all thoſe Advantages that he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains againſt thoſe that have adventured
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:61588:98"/>
to contend with him, ſo ſwell his Heart, that he has much ado to govern it.</p>
            <p>We cannot deny but that the force of Generoſity is highly extraordinary; But thence it does not follow, that it is a vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Force: For as <hi>St. Auſtin</hi> ſays, <q>There are two ſorts of ſtrong Men, that divide all Mankind: the one ſort, is of ſuch who are ſtrong through the vehemence of their deſires. The other ſort, that is to ſay, True Chriſtians, are ſtrong through the greatneſs of their Charity.</q> There is nothing that they will not venture for the Love of God. There is nothing which the others will not dare, or are not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to act for the Love of themſelves, and to gratify their Paſſions. To them they are beholding for all their force and Strength; and it is their Ambition that empowers 'em to vanquiſh their Revenge, For how ſweet ſoever pleaſure of Revenge may be, an ambitious Perſon that loves Glory, finds the Honour which he ſeeks in a Generous proceeding, much more ſweet than his Revenge. Reaſon alſo joyns with his Ambition, and ſhews him, that Revenge, how pleaſing ſoever, it is but a Tranſitory Delight; where the Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:61588:99"/>
which he acquires by his Generoſity, remains to perpetuity.</p>
            <p>The Generoſity of Prime Miniſters, and ſuch as are in Authority, proceeds from their Intereſt; and therefore when they apprehend that a perſon of Merit, or high Quality is obſtructed, being their profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Enemy, and perplex'd in his Affairs, they preſently uſe all their diligence to help him out of his trouble, on purpoſe to gain his good Will, and fix him to their Intereſts. And upon the ſame ſcore they are more officious many times to gratify their greateſt Enemies, than their moſt faithful and zealous Friends.</p>
            <p>Again, our Natural Malignity is the moſt uſual cauſe of our Generoſity; For in ſerving thoſe that have croſs'd our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, we do but heap, as it were, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Coals of Fire upon their Heads; that is to ſay, we do 'em kindneſs for no other end, but only to make 'em aſham'd that ever they did us any injury, and to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der 'em the more inexcuſable, if they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere in their Malice towards us. The Spirit of Revenge may be reckon'd for a piece of this Malignity. For we believe that if a Perſon to whom we have been
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:61588:99"/>
frequently ſerviceable, comes to fail in the Obligations which he owes us, he will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band himſelf, and revenge the injuſtice done us, much better than we can do our ſelves.</p>
            <p>The Generoſity of Victors toward the Vanquiſh'd, is either vain or politic; which makes us wonder that Hiſtorians ſhould extoll the kindneſs which <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> ſhewed to the Mother, Wife, and Daughter of <hi>Darius,</hi> for Actions really Generous. For beſides that their Sex and Quality in ſome meaſure, obliged him to thoſe Civilities, and that he could not have done otherwiſe, without a great ſtain to his Reputation; he was ſo deſperately in Love with Honour, that his Soul not being ſatisfy'd with what he had gain'd by his Victories, he labours inceſſantly to augment his Civilities; beſides that, he took care, as much as in him lay, to alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate the misfortunes of thoſe Captive Princes, to prevent their Hatred againſt him that was the Author of all their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries. He had alſo a particular aim ſo far to recover the good Opinion of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> and the Royal Family, as to believe, that ſince their evil deſtiny had depriv'd
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:61588:100"/>
'em of the former Luſter, and ſubjected 'em under his Dominion, they could not have fall'n into better hands. And we find that <hi>Alexander</hi> obtained the Honor which he deſired by the Prayer of <hi>Darius,</hi> to the Gods, That if they were fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in their diſpleaſure, to take from his Family the Diadem of <hi>Perſia,</hi> they would ſet it upon <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Head, to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence the Vertue of ſo good and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a Prince. The ſame Honor he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd from <hi>Siſygambis</hi> the Queen. <q>This Soveraignty, ſaid She, is ſo ſoft and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, that the Remembrance of my paſt Felicity does no way render me uneaſie in the Condition of my preſent Fortune.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Nor was it out of any deſire to revenge the death of <hi>Darius,</hi> or out of any hatred of the Treaſon, that he ſo ſeverely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd that horrid Aſſaſſination committed by <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſſus,</hi> ſince it was his Perfidiouſneſs, how execrable ſoever, that put <hi>Alexander</hi> in the poſſeſſion of the greateſt Empire in the World. But it was for his Honour, and his Intereſts ſake, that he reveng'd the Death of <hi>Darius,</hi> but chiefly for the ſake of his Intereſt. For he put <hi>Beſſus</hi> to death, to prevent the Conſpiracy of his
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:61588:100"/>
own Commanders againſt him. And this is no more than the Advice which <hi>Darius</hi> ſent him ſome few Minutes before he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pir'd, that it would be no leſs Profitable than Honourable for him to proſecute his Revenge upon that execrable Parricide <hi>Beſſus,</hi> as owing that Example to the World; and for that it was the common Cauſe of all Kings.</p>
            <p>Leſs does it deſerve the name of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity, when ſeeing <hi>Darius</hi> lying all along dead in his Chariot, he cover'd his Body with his upper Garment, and bitterly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail'd the Misfortune of ſo Great a King, for coming to an end ſo unſuitable to his high Dignity. For it was no Sentiment of Generoſity that made him bewail the evil deſtiny of his Enemy, for that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> was none of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Enemy, but <hi>Alexander</hi> was <hi>Darius</hi>'s, and had invaded his Empire; So that it was <hi>Alexander</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf who was the real Subject of his own Lamentations, who reflecting upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the Perſon of <hi>Darius,</hi> ſaw himſelf abandon'd by his own People, aſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:61588:101"/>
Among theſe ſorts of People who e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem as Generous all thoſe Sentiments, wherein there appears ſomething of Grandeur of Mind, as the Contempt of Mony and vain Honours; ſome there are that vilifie this ſort of Generoſity; Fore-ſeeing, that almoſt all the World run after the Favour of Great Perſonages, and court their Kindneſs, not only with a reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs credulity, but after a ſordid and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſeeming manner, they ſteer a quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contrary courſe. They refuſe all atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon thoſe Great Men, to deſire any Kindneſs at their hands, or ſo much as to ſpeak to 'em. Or if any Miniſter be civil to 'em, where he meets 'em by chance; or ſends 'em word that he has a particular eſteem for them; inſtead of Anſwering theſe Cruelties with Reſpect, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more haughty, and rigid againſt all Courtiers; for poor ſpirited People, giving no Quarter to thoſe, who being free from the Corruptions of the Court, hold a friendly Correſpondence only with the Prime Miniſters, to preſerve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their Employments, or out of a deſire to advance themſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:61588:101"/>
The Conduct of theſe falſe-hearted Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſities is only a vain affectation, and contempt of Favour, proceeding from a conceal'd diſpleaſure, to ſee that there is no probability of being introduced into Court, either becauſe the Employments which they deſire are already full, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they believe that they who are in the Kings Favour are not kind to them. And that which begets in them this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, is this, that they are altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible of thoſe marks of Favour ſhewn 'em by the chief Miniſters, while they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the Honors and Careſſes which they receive, tend only to enſlave 'em; Whereas not one of 'em but is eaſily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, when a Favourite offers 'em in earneſt his Amity and Confidence. This ſingularity of their Proceeding proves that it does not partake of any vertuous Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; For Vertue affects no particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, nor does it abſolutely renounce any; but always guides it ſelf by the Rules which are preſcrib'd by Decency and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Beſides, this is a certain Maxim, That all Singularity, under whatever for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced diſguiſes, proceeds from the Irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Mind, or ſome ambitious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:61588:102"/>
or ſome Intereſt that lyes conceal'd in the Heart.</p>
            <p>Therefore, as none but Chriſtians have a ſincere Love for thoſe that hate 'em, that perſecute 'em, that deſpoil 'em of their Eſtates, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <head>CHAP. XIII. <hi>POLITENESS.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>MOſt People confine <hi>Politeneſs</hi> to Language only, and will allow it no other Employment than to chooſe, to place and Muſter up words together. Nevertheleſs, moſt certain it is, that Men may be very rude in their Behaviour, be Sots and meer Pedants, yet perfectly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand Language. To <hi>Politeneſs</hi> therefore other Functions belong much more exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, eſpecially thoſe which it enjoys in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the Soul. For there it is that Politeneſs renders our Thoughts, our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhes, and our Sentiments civil and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate: and there it is that Politeneſs cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes this Delicacy and Civility to caſt a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion on our Actions, our Proceedings, and all the exterior Behaviours of Men: So that it is no where to be found but at Court, where all things are in that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Perfection, where we obſerve ſome Perſons ſo Polite, that they never act or
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:61588:103"/>
ſpeak any thing to be found fault with, or that give the leaſt offence.</p>
            <p>But they, who together with an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Education, have obtain'd a great Knowledge in the World, are not ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with being <hi>Polite</hi> in reference to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; nor does their Induſtry bound it ſelf in the regulation of their own Actions and Words to that exactneſs, as not to give the leaſt diſtaſt; but they find it neceſſary alſo to be <hi>Polite,</hi> in reference to others, and that it behoves 'em to ſtudy their Humors and Sentiments, that they may underſtand how to ſpeak, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have themſelves, to render themſelves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable in company.</p>
            <p>Nor do they ſtop there, but as they are People that dive into the Breaſts of every Man, and for that they know he is leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd for what flatters his Inclinations, than for what is ſerviceable to his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, they not only take all opportunities to ſerve others, like thoſe that go under the name of <hi>Double Diligent;</hi> but they accompany their Services with all that they can imagine to be moſt obliging, and moſt capable to pleaſe, becauſe they believe it is with kind Offices and Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:61588:103"/>
as with Diamonds, whoſe value is in themſelves, but their Luſtre becomes more pleaſing and delightful, according as they are Set by the Artiſt.</p>
            <p>We muſt not wonder then, if they that have attain'd the perfection of Polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, of which we have given the <hi>Idea,</hi> are ſo acceptable at Court, and ſo well received in all Companies. And the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of this ſort of People contributes much to enhance their price. For if we conſider the diſpoſitions of the greateſt part of men, how that to engage ſome to ſerve us in our moſt important Affairs, it behoves us to ſet all our Wits at work; how that when we have earneſtly impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tun'd 'em, we muſt frequently renew our Requeſts; how they will put us off from time to time, and at length give us a ſlight account of our Buſineſs; we are over joy'd to meet with People that ſeem to divine our buſineſs before we have diſcover'd it, and immediately untertake it as their own, and follow it cloſe till they have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh'd it, to the wiſhes of their Friends.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:61588:104"/>
But whatever <hi>Encomiums</hi> Men may give this ſort of Politeneſs, and tho we are perſwaded that there is nothing ſo rare or worthy of eſteem, we can eaſily prove it to be no vertuous Quality. Firſt, becauſe thoſe Perſons who are moſt applauded for it, are People ſo far from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Piety, without which there can be no ſound and real Vertue; that we always obſerve 'em moſt deeply engag'd in all the Intreagues at Court, acting al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together according to the Fetches of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Policy: and ſome of 'em very irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular in their Manners, without Faith or Polity; which however we are ſtill ready to pardon, provided they do our Buſineſs.</p>
            <p>In the Second place we never meet with this <hi>Politeneſs</hi> but in Perſons endued with abundance of Wit, and conſequently ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to apprehend all the effects of a Kindneſs don effectually, quickly, and with a good Grace: On the other ſide, that Men loſe the Fruit of their Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, by long delay, or when they muſt be ſpurr'd on by Importunity, and tireſome Sollicitations; and that it is not the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations, but the manner of obliging that engages People in our Intereſts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:61588:104"/>
In the Third place, They that ſurpaſs in the Art of Obliging, never do all they can do, but when they have to deal with Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as quick as themſelves, who are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to obſerve and value what is rare and ſingular in their management.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, They chiefly wait for Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities to ſerve ſuch perſons as are moſt conſiderable at Court for their Merit, their Quality, or their Fortunes. And then it is that they ſpare neither Care nor Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, to the end their good Offices and Services may be embelliſht, with what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is capable to render their Seduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty valuable, and their Perſons Graceful to their Employers.</p>
            <p>Theſe are certain Proofs that their <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs</hi> is no vertuous Quality, and that we ought not to be ſo much dazl'd with the Wonders which they perform for the ſervice of their Friends; but that all their Services, accompliſh'd with ſo much Zeal, ſo much Diligence, ſo much Fidelity and Exactneſs, are but ſo many examples of Services to ſhew us after what a ready, exact and perfect manner they would be ſerved themſelves. If any queſtion it, they need no more than call to mind the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:61588:105"/>
Complaints which they make themſelves of Perſons, who being oblig'd to their former Kindneſſes, forſake 'em in their Buſineſs, or being entruſted in their Affairs, either neglect or ſollicite 'em ſo careleſly, as if they never minded what became ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of themſelves or their Friends.</p>
            <p>True Chriſtians therefore are the only Perſons in whom this ſort of <hi>Politeneſs</hi> becomes a Vertue, and who are owners of all the Qualities that are attributed to it: For they have ſo great a value for their Neighbours, that they ſtudy all manner of Precaution to behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as not to give the leaſt Offence in any of their Words or Actions. They ſtudy all the Complacency imaginable, and they embrace the Intereſts of their Neighbours with an Affection ſo Sincere and Cordial, that in all they act for him it is viſible, that they never ſeek them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. So that we may ſay that <hi>Charity,</hi> which is the Original of that Conduct which they obſerve toward their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, is the ſole and only true <hi>Polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and real Civility, and that of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Men, Chriſtians are the truly Polite and Civil People.</p>

            <p>AS there are certain Vizards ſo fine and ſo natural, that they can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be diſtinguiſh'd from the Countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces themſelves; and others ſo clowniſhly and botche<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly, that they are eaſily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcern'd. So there are ſome Vertues ſo well counterfeited that we take 'em fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently for currant; and others, of which the World eaſily diſcerns the Cheat. When we ſee a Perſon upon the Scaffold that faces Death with Reſolution, and who chooſes rather to ſuffer than to betray his intimate Friend by his Confeſſion; to weaken ſuch a convincing Proof of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, it behoves us to have ſounded the very bottom of that Mans Heart, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover that his Friendſhip had a leſs ſhare in that action than his Vanity. But when we find People Vain in their Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inues, Haughty in their Behaviour, yet always
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:61588:106"/>
affecting the lower Hand, and upon all occaſions pretending low Thoughts of themſelves; there needs no ſuch piercing judgment to diſcern their feigned Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, and their counterfeit Humility.</p>
            <p>We may ſay, and that not untruly, that it was in the boſome of the Court, that this falſe Vertue was firſt bred. For it is the Court only that produces this ſort of People that are aſham'd and offended at the <hi>Encomiunts</hi> given them, that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value themſelves, and who being extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly troubl'd to receive Honors that are due to 'em, pay to others more than they are oblig'd to do. Which proceeds from hence, that it is properly at the Court, where Fortune enflames Ambition to ſhew the greateſt Favours. For enflam'd Ambition cauſes Courtiers continually to aſſume new Shapes, and to all manner of Parts to obtain and extoll thoſe Favors. In other places ſhe diſpences but petty Graces; Whence we obſerve, That Men are more Natural in the Country, that they do not force their Inclinations, and Study leſs to counterfeit old Vertues, and invent new ones.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:61588:106"/>
To diſcover therefore the falſhood of this Vertue, it behoves us to conſider, That Pride is ſo much the abſolute Maſter of Man, that it is the Prince of all his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Inclinations, and of all his Actions. We are to obſerve moreover, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out aſtoniſhment, That it is equally the cauſe as well of his Emotions as of his Repoſe; and that after it has rais'd Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in his Soul, it as ſuddainly calms 'em by a miraculous Power. For at the ſame time that Delicacy renders Man ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of an Injury, Pride at the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant kindles his Anger, and that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes himſelf to his Arms to kindle his Reſentment; and when his Tranſportments, and his Impetuoſities disband him; Pride ſuddainly appeaſes him, and reſtores him to his firſt ſettlement. So that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s definition of Nature, perfectly agrees with Pride, as being the true principle of Mans Motion and Reſt.</p>
            <p>We are alſo to obſerve, that Pride is Morally invincible; that the meaneſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition never abates it, no diſgraceful or unfortunate accident humbles it, nor can any Puiſſance make it ſubmit; So that a
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:61588:107"/>
proud Perſon may well be trampl'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foot, but never be tam'd.</p>
            <p>If Pride then Governs and maſters Man, and will never ſuffer him to be ſubdu'd, as we all find by experience; it is eaſie from hence to conclude, That when a Man deſpiſes and rebukes himſelf, his Words betray his Thoughts; and that every time he debaſes himſelf before others, 'tis only to exalt himſelf above others; and that he would never act ſo contrary to his proud and haughty <hi>Genius,</hi> were he not convinc'd that there was nothing more proper to advance him than his own vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary unworthy Thoughts of himſelf.</p>
            <p>There are other Marks to ſhew, that the Humility of the falſly Humble, is no more than Diſſimulation. The Firſt is, That at the ſame time that they ſeem to have ſuch a ſcorn and contempt of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they continually obſerve the beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of others towards 'em; they rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly expect from others thoſe Formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Reſpects which are their due, and revenge the leaſt injuries done 'em. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Guarini</hi> ſaid, That there was no fair Weather ſo deceitful, as that which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the Countenances of Courtiers;
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:61588:107"/>
in regard that at the ſame time that they ſeem'd calm and ſedate, a Word, or a Geſture would change all their Serenity into Storm and Tempeſt.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Gente placida, in viſta è manſueta</l>
               <l>Mapriu del cupo Mar tumida e fera</l>
               <l>A ſort of People in their Looks moſt mild.</l>
               <l>But anger'd once, than Sormy Seas more wild.</l>
            </q>
            <p>A Second Mark is this, That they are ſmooth and ſupple, in reſpect of Perſons uſeful to their Intereſts, haughty in their Behaviour to others. <hi>Cylla,</hi> ſaid <hi>Plutarch,</hi> humbled himſelf before thoſe of whom he ſtood in need, but wou'd be ador'd by thoſe that ſtood in need of him.</p>
            <p>The Third Mark is this, That they who ſo willingly affect the loweſt Seats at Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtivals and publick Aſſemblies, never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe themſelves in that manner, but with regard to ſuch perſons who they know they can take place of when they pleaſe without contending for it; and that no Men are more jealous to preſerve their rank among their Equals; and that it is a pain to 'em to ſubmit to thoſe whoſe quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y ſuperior to theirs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="198" facs="tcp:61588:108"/>
The Fourth is, That among thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeiters of Humility, who condeſcend to utter the meanſt things of themſelves, who acknowledge their Errors, their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and evil Inclinations; There is not one that makes theſe acknowledgments in order to his own Reformation, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to diſcharge themſelves of ſome part of the blame which is laid upon 'em, and to leſſen the ſhame which they ought to have for what they have done. And this petty piece of Politiques it is, that cauſes Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to confeſs their entertaining of <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants,</hi> that they may do it with more Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and leſs Shame.</p>
            <p>As for Errors and Defects, there is not one who accuſes himſelf of any that are Eſſential, as to have neither Honor, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bity to be a Lyar or a Cheat. Only they blame themſelves for not being prompt and quick, for being negligent, ſlothful, and ſuch like faults that are no ſtain to their Reputation. The moſt perfect may have ſometime return'd an idle Anſwer, or have been tranſported beyond the bounds of Moderation. But no body confeſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s that he has robb'd or betray'd his Friends. And we are further to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:61588:108"/>
That they who make theſe Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions with the leaſt trouble, are perſons of the deepeſt reach, for they underſtand better than others, that it is not ſo igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious to confeſs Faults that all the World commits, than to be ſo vain as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to acknowledg themſelves in an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.</p>
            <p>Now all theſe Marks confirm that Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the Scripture, <hi>There is a wicked Man that hangs down his Head ſadly, but is full of deceit:</hi> and that ſaying of <hi>St. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin, That falſe Humility is great Pride.</hi> They alſo ſhew, That the Humiliy of the People of this World is but a Piece of <hi>unſtable</hi> Cunning to make themſelves more eſteem'd than they ſeem to deſire by their words, and by their actions to make little accompt of themſelves; ſo that their Humility is only a diſguis'd Pride and a viſible Hypocriſie.</p>
            <p>
               <q>But True Humility, ſays <hi>St. Auſtin,</hi> is a Vertue ſo particular to Chriſtians, that the Pagan Philoſophers never knew what it meant. I have read great Truths ſays the Learned Father, in the Books of the Platonicks; but none of thoſe Books inſtruct us in the Knowledge of
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:61588:109"/>
that humble Piety, which is no where to be found but among the Chriſtians.</q> For Pride ſhuts their Underſtandings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe Lights that diſcover'd Man to himſelf, and only carried 'em to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of thoſe flattering Vertues that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalize their Reputation; Only Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians have the priviledge to humble themſelves before God, through their acknowledgment of that Nothing, out of which Man was firſt Created, and of that miſerable Condition to which Sin has reduc'd him.</p>
            <p>And therefore we have great reaſon to wonder at the Miſtake of <hi>Plutarch,</hi> who apprehends for a great action of Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that of <hi>Thales,</hi> wherefore the <hi>Tripos</hi> of Gold with the Oracle, adjudg'd him as the wiſeſt Man then living. For that Philoſopher having labour'd all his Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time to merit that Title, would by no means let go ſuch a fair opportunity to ſhew that he was worthy of it. For being ſo Wiſe in the eſteem of the World, he ſhewed by his refuſal of the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos,</hi> that he was not ſo in his own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Nor could he do otherwiſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hazarding the Cenſure of being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuons
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:61588:109"/>
in regard that <hi>Bias,</hi> who was offer'd it before, had refus'd it in like manner. So that the Philoſopher be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hav'd him like one emulous of Glory, while he aſpir'd to the reputation of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Wiſe, by making a ſemblance of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving himſelf a Fool.</p>
            <p>But then again, as for the Humility of Chriſtians that tax themſelves for many Defects, of which they neither are, nor believe themſelves to be guilty; it is a falſe Humility; for that real Humility is never contrary to Truth. Nor does it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in the Confeſſion that a Man makes, that he is beholding for his Being, and all his Bleſſings both Natural and Supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, to the pure Goodneſs of God; it be hoves him moreover to acknowledge that his Underſtanding is full of Error, that his Inclinations are all depraved, and that by Nature nothing in the Sight of God, he is become a <hi>Nothing</hi> in oppoſition to God, and in Arms againſt his Soveraign.</p>

            <p>PLeaſure not only cauſes the Irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the moſt part of Humane Actions, but it is alſo the moſt uſual Source of the Errors of Men. For as our Minds and our Senſes follow its Allurements with an equal Zeal; ſo our Wits are always em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in the ſearch of what is moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for its ſatisfaction. Whence it comes to paſs, that we are ſtill to ſind out Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions much more lovely in appearance, than they are indeed; nay, tho they be falſe and deceitful, provided they pleaſe, we always judge 'em to be real.</p>
            <p>And this ſame perpetual Induſtry of Human Wit, to gratify its ſelf with fair and lovely Objects, is the reaſon that it
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:61588:111"/>
has found out Heroes with Divine Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; that there are Men, who by the ſtrength of their Reaſon, triumph over Pain, Pleaſure, Anger and Revenge; and that there are others endued with Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſo Noble, that they are of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves enclin'd to undertake and perform all the Actions which the moſt Illuſtrious Vertues inſpire.</p>
            <p>We muſt not wonder then, if the World has ſuch a high eſteem for <hi>Liberality,</hi> which is in the number of thoſe Vertues that caſt abroad the brighteſt Luſtre; and that they believe it not only to be a Vertue moſt ſincere, but alſo rare and altogether extraordinary. Of this Men are ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convinc'd, and have ſuch an Affection and Admiration for thoſe that make a noiſe in the World by their Preſents, and their Bounty, that at Court they ſeem to make publick Vows for their Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, provided they be cunning, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Liberality that pleaſes and obliges, and that they take their oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities to be profuſe in the ſight of thoſe, by whom it is for their Advantage to be eſteem'd. Princes, and all Perſons of high Quality reap great Advantages from <hi>Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality,</hi>
               <pb n="204" facs="tcp:61588:112"/>
ſince it diſtinguiſhes 'em from others in the ſame degree; and for that by their Benefits they oblige the more honeſt ſort of People, and attract the Good Will of all Men. Avarice alſo gives it a Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Luſter, and that Vice which renders ſo great a number of People Vile and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, contributes not a little to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haunſe the value of thoſe who are endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Noble and Generous Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and who never value Mony, but out of the pleaſure which they take to ſpend it.</p>
            <p>If Great Perſonages, and generally all thoſe who are high in eſteem for their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality, were really ſuch as by <hi>Fame</hi> they are repreſented; If they valued the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Great Eſtates, only for the advantage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of bettering the condition of their Friends, or for being thereby enabl'd to gratify Perſons of Worth and Merit; If they embraced all opportunities of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good, ſo that we might ſay of 'em,
<q>And the Good that ſecks 'em out, at the ſame time flies their ſight;</q>
We could not then without extream Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice refuſe 'em the higheſt of <hi>Encomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ms.</hi> But we ſhall find they are far dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:61588:112"/>
from what they ſeem to be; if we refer our ſelves to the Teſtimony of thoſe judicious and ſolid Perſons, who never relying upon common Opinions, take par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular cognizance of the Manners of Men; for theſe Perſons thus inſtructed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, aſſure us, that thoſe Perſons whoſe Liberality we adore, are even at the brink of Deſpair, when there is any ſmall Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence requir'd at home, at the ſame time that they are ſo extravagantly profuſe in the ſight of the World. That they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe even neceſſary ſubſiſtance to their Relations and Friends, when upon others they ſpend even to Superfluity; and that the Wages of their Servants are unpaid, when they give high Entertainments to Strangers.</p>
            <p>And this is a ſtrong proof, That Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality that advances the Eſteem of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Perſons, is a fallacious Vertue: And the force of the Argument conſiſts in this, That the Character of True Vertue is to agree with all the other Vertues. Now the Liberality of thoſe, whoſe Pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways open to their Friends, is viſibly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Juſtice; for we know well that while they are ſo free of their Preſents,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:61588:113"/>
and that they let no opportunity of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence eſcape, they not only never mind the payment of their Debts, but frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give away what they have borrowed, and ſometimes robb'd, or got by violence from other People. And the ſame Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment makes it out, That the <hi>Spirit</hi> which animates 'em is the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Vanity,</hi> which can always find Mony to ſupply a Vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious Humor, but never to recompence a Servant grown old in their Service, nor to pay a Tradeſman that hath furniſh'd 'em with his Goods, to his Ruine.</p>
            <p>Therefore theſe Perſons ſo famous for their Liberality, are no more than Civil violators of Juſtice and Equity. Of which there are two ſorts; Thoſe that ruine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by their Profuſion, and deprive their Children of what they laviſh away to ſtrangers: And thoſe that being advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to high Employments, rob the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick to en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ich particular Perſons, and Heads of Factions; who to gratify their Friends, and purchaſe the Favour of the Rabble, deſpoil the Eſtates of thoſe that refuſe to ſide with their Intereſts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="207" facs="tcp:61588:113"/>
Now tho they all reſemble one another in the injury they do to Juſtice both Publick and Private, yet the Motives that induce 'em to Liberality, are quite different. For the Liberality of ſome is purely Vain-glorious, which is the moſt uſual ſort of Liberality. The Liberality of others is Vain-glorious, but Politick withal; and ſuch was <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, who to out-do the Preſents which <hi>Taxites,</hi> King of the <hi>Indies</hi> had ſent him, made him a Magnificent Banquet, where he drank to him a Health of Six hundred thouſand Crowns, or a thouſand Talents, which he ordered forthwith to be paid him. And others there are whoſe Profuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes are purely Political, as were thoſe of <hi>Ceſar,</hi> who kept open Houſe, entertain'd a vaſt Retinue of Servants, and divertiz'd the People of <hi>Rome</hi> with publick Shews and Interludes at his own expence, on purpoſe to oblige 'em to give him their Suffrages to advance him to the chief Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments in the Commonwealth; which was the firſt ſtep to his Imperial Dignity. The Profuſeneſs of <hi>Scipio</hi> was upon the ſame ſcore, as appears by the reproaches that <hi>Cato</hi> the <hi>Cenſor</hi> made him. <q>Thou
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:61588:114"/>
conſumeſt, ſaid he, even the Publick Revenue in exceſſive Gifts to the Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Officers, to gain their Hearts, and make thy ſelf Maſter of the Army, not minding the Corruption of Military Diſcipline, and that thou art the cauſe, that their Courage grows Effeminate, while pamper'd by thy Luxuries.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Second Proof of the Falſhood of Liberality is this, That aſſoon as a Man propoſes Expence to himſelf, that he may appear Honourable, his Avarice oppoſes his Vain-Glory, and contends againſt it with all it's force. And altho the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt be conceal'd in his Breaſt, yet may it be diſcover'd by the Effects which it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces. For we find every day that a Great Lord that has entertain'd in his Houſe Perſons of the ſame Quality, after he has given order that nothing be wanting that is in Seaſon, Neat, Delicate, and Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent; the next day when he comes to reckon with his Steward, he diſputes the price of Things, and ſhews by his Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports his Vexation, and ſometimes by his Repentance, that he had not been ſo ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did, but that his Ambition got the upper hand of his Avarice, and that a Liberal
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:61588:114"/>
Man is but the Martyr of his Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>Affectation is a Third Proof that Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality is no ſincere Vertue. This Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation is viſible in the foregoing Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples. We have known a Great Lord of the Old Court, who having loſt a great Sum at Play, left off of a ſuddain; and becauſe People believ'd he left off to ſave the reſt of his Mony, which was very conſiderable, he gave it away in cold Blood to thoſe that ſupply'd the Cards, to the admiration of all the Company. We have ſeen a Governour of a Province, whoſe Train equall'd that of a Soveraign Prince, who orde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>'d a prodigious num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Cloaths to be made him, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver wore the ſame Suit twice; but after he had worn a Suit one day, gave it away to his Favourites, or to his Servants, which made him look'd upon in his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and over all <hi>France,</hi> for the moſt Liberal and Generous Perſon in the World.</p>
            <p>The Fourth Proof is this, That they who are eſteem'd for their Liberality, let all the World ſee what they do: Whence it comes to paſs, that they are more or
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:61588:115"/>
leſs Liberal, according to the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which they have to be ſo; but never ſhew it, unleſs they have remarkable Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of their Liberality.</p>
            <p>Play is the next Proof, that Man is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver truly Liberal; for when the heat of Play has diſorder'd him, and render'd him uncapable to conceal his ordinary Defects and vicious Inclinations, preſently he cries out,</p>
            <q>
               <l>Doloſi Spes refulſit Nummi.</l>
               <l>Hope of deceitful Mony brightly ſhon.</l>
            </q>
            <p>The hope of Gain kindles him in ſuch a manner, and renders it ſelf ſo ſuddainly Maſter of his Thoughts, that if he win, he feels at the bottom of his Heart, that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately aſcends into his Face: If he loſe, he brooks his loſs with an extreme Anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; So that the ſame Perſon that ſeems to throw away his Mony profuſely, applies himſelf to his Game with all the eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs imaginable, and ſhews how truly he loves the Good, which he ſtrives to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe.</p>
            <p>The Sixth Proof is, That Perſons who are accounted Liberal, never obſerve the Dictates of Reaſon in the diſtribution of
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:61588:115"/>
their Gifts; for they ſquander 'em ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to Perſons of no Worth or Merit: They take no care to proportion their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to the Nature of their Exigencies; they gratify the Rich, and leave thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarded to whom a ſmall taſte of their Vertue would be an incredible Relief. This mark of Falſe Liberality is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable; Whereas on the other ſide, it is a certain ſign that a Man is truly Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, if he prefer out of Choice for Objects, Perſons of Merit and Vertue fallen under Misfortune; if he beſtow his Mony upon poor Widows, burthened with a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Family; or to People impriſon'd for ſmall and trivial Debts.</p>
            <p>In the laſt place we prove that no Man is Liberal, becauſe there is not any Man but who is Covetous; for that all the Paſſions are predominant to ſome degree or other in the Heart of Man; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently Avarice as well as others: And tho it appear not equally alike in all Men, ſhe ſhews her ſelf in all, and at all times, or at leaſt upon ſeveral occaſions. We find alſo that Avarice is a Paſſion predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant in all thoſe that are advanced in years; For as their Buſineſs increaſes eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:61588:116"/>
day with their Infirmities, and as their experience alſo has taught 'em, that there are a thouſand ways to loſe the Eſtate and Fortune which a Man thinks himſelf ſureof, ſo they all bemoan their own Conditions, and ſtudy all the ways ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable of Thrift and Sparing; So that after Ambition, Love, Envy, Jealouſie, Hatred and Revenge have tyranniz'd over Man, Covetouſneſs comes to torment him in her turn, and ſo concludes his miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Life. This Paſſion that brings him ſo low, is the laſt Agitation that troubles his Repoſe, and ſhews him, That if he ſeek not for it in God, he muſt never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect it but in his Tomb.</p>
            <p>What has been ſaid may ſerve to put us in mind of that admirable ſaying of <hi>Plato,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>That the Vertue of Men was no more than an Exchange.</hi> For this defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion perfectly agrees with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iberality, ſince that which we exerciſe moſt uſually, is but exchange of Mony for Honor, as we find in thoſe perſons who are prodigal of their own in the ſight of Princes and Great Perſonages, meerly to oblige 'em to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn 'em their expences, in Penſions, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, or Honourable Preferments:
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:61588:116"/>
and ſo in theſe Men who are highly Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious, who purchaſe the Suffrages of the People to obtain the Soveraign Power; it is an Exchange of Mony for Dominion; The Liberality of Lovers, who conſume their Eſtates in Preſents, and other idle Expences, is an Exchange of Mony for the ſatisfaction which they deſire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>But Chriſtian Liberality is only true Liberality, and a ſincere Vertue. For Chriſtians always draw from an innocent Stock all the Preſents and Benefits which they beſtow, and never give to others what they owe, or what they have given to others. And in regard they do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing out of Oſtentation, they conceal their Gifts with an extraordinary care, and in all things obſerve the Rules of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, Juſtice and Prudence, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders their Liberality truly Vertuous, and that they are the ſame in their Hearts, as they appear in their Actions.</p>

            </head>
            <p>THere is nothing that flatters the vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory of Man ſo much, as his own Deſigns and Projects: yet generally all his Contrivances turn to his loſs; Thoſe of the Ambitious diſquiet their Repoſe; Thoſe of the Covetous, condemn 'em to thoſe cares that feed upon their Bowels, while they live; and the Deſigns of thoſe that build up pompous and ſtately Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and go attended with Magnificent Trains, diſcover their Littleneſs, and their Indigence. For muſt not that Man think himſelf to be very little, and otherwiſe of no Merit or Worth, who rears up lof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Buildings, furniſhes himſelf with Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and a numerous Retinue of Pages and Lacqueys, meerly to make an Addition
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:61588:117"/>
to himſelf, and to aggrandize himſelf by that ſort of means?</p>
            <p>Magnificence therefore is but a haughty Sentiment, and a kind of Deſpair of ever finding our ſelves any thing Great, or of extraordinary Worth; which is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon we have recourſe to rich Moveables, Tapeſtries heightned with Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, as very low Women make uſe of Cork to raiſe themſelves higher. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> extols this apparent Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity into a ſublime Vertue, far ſurpaſſing Liberality: For he believes that it is with Magnificence in reſpect of Liberality, as, it is with Valour in reſpect of Boldneſs: For that of Boldneſs ſurmounts the Fears that diſorder us, while Valour triumphs over thoſe which are wont abſolutely to terrify and ſubdue us. So Liberality en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines us to moderate and order our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, and Mauger our Natural Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs; but that it is Magnificence that carries us to Immenſe and extraordinary Profuſion, and which gives us an entire Victory over Covetouſneſs. But that which makes us queſtion whether Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence have that advantage over Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, is this, That we find G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eat Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:61588:118"/>
that have all opportunities to be profuſe in their Buildings and Equipages yet are very pinching and ſparing; and to whom it is a Trouble almoſt Invincible to be Liberal, but a pleaſure to be Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. But this is certain, That there is no other difference between the Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and Liberality of this Age, than there is between Pride and Vanity; For what is the Magnificence of Princes, and opulent Perſons? What are thoſe Palaces where Gold, Marble, and Porphery do caſt ſuch a reſplendent Luſter? What are all thoſe ſtately Fabricks in the Countrey where all the Rules of Symmetry appear? What are all thoſe Gracious Parks, enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Woods and Rivers, but a haughty and pompous Shew of this high Condition and Wealth, of which, if we deſire to be further convinc'd, we need but conſider, that Moderation is only the aba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ement of this Loftineſs and Exceſs, and that we give high Encomiums to thoſe, who find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves advanc'd in Dignity, and loaden with Riches, practiſe that Vertue of Moderation in their Buildings, their Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, their Furniture, and their Table Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="217" facs="tcp:61588:118"/>
How then could it come into <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Mind, That a Man who conſumes the beſt part of his Eſtate in vain-glorious and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Superfluities, ſhould be a perſon not only worthy to be applauded, but alſo excellently vertuous? For can it be ſaid, that a Magnificent Perſon may vertuouſly hold a ſtately and Magnificent Fabrick, unleſs he regulate his Expences according to his Eſtate, and that his Magnificence ſhews it ſelf in laſting and durable Things, as Pillars and Columns of Marble, not in brittle Glaſs-windows? and provided he do not imitate the <hi>Megareans,</hi> who made ſplendid Banquets for their Comedians, and receiv'd 'em into their City with ſo much Pomp, that the very Streets as they paſs'd along were cover'd with Purple. Is it not evident that all the Inconveniences which this Philoſopher would have us to ſhun, ſerve only to preſerve a Man from being ridiculous, but no way prevent his being vain-glorious, on beſtowing ſuch exceſſive Sums in Painting, Guilding and coſtly Furniture? Is it not certain, that if Magnificence have no other Limits than thoſe to which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> has confin'd it, there is no ſort of ſuperfluity which he might
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:61588:119"/>
not have juſtified by the ſame Reaſons? and that he would have been ſo far from diſapproving, that he would have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended thoſe prodigious Buildings of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cullus,</hi> upon the Shoar of the <hi>Neopolitan</hi> Sea? The Mountain digg'd quite tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and ſupported by a ſtupendious Arch, the vaſt and deep Moats to let in the Sea that ſurrounded the wondrous Pile? And that he never would have found fault with long exceſs in the infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Statues and Pictures, wherewith it was adorn'd, nor the more credible num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Rooms and Apartiments neatly furniſh'd; nor in thoſe heaps of Gold and Silver Plate, adorn'd with precious Stones, in which <hi>Lucullus</hi> was continually ſerv'd? Yet theſe exceſſes were ſo generally blam'd in <hi>Rome,</hi> that his neareſt Relations and his Friends, among the reſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Caron</hi> and <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> were highly offended at his Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance; beſides that, they were for a long time the Subjects of the publick Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, and Railery of the Town; as we find in <hi>Horace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore we muſt not attribute the War which the <hi>Cynni</hi> declare againſt Luxury, to their Malice and fantaſtical
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:61588:119"/>
Humor. For this War is ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing particular, ſince it is no more than what the Wiſe Men of all Ages have done, who ever look'd upon the Pomp of Buildings, and the Curioſity of Furniture, and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, as meer Vanity and Childiſhneſs. <q>We are true Children, ſaid <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> the Marble Pillars, and Statues delight us as painted Shells and Baubles pleaſe them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo that there is no other difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and us, but that our Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and divertiſements are much more coſtly, and our Childhood continues all our Lives.</q> And thus from what has been ſaid it is evident, how hard a thing it is to condeſcend to the Opinion of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle,</hi> who ſo openly defends Luxury, with the ſolidity of ſo Great a Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher. <q>
                  <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> ſays <hi>St. Thomas,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empts from him thoſe that are ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in their Expences, and I condemn as evil whatever is contrary to the Rules of Juſtice and Reaſon.</q>
            </p>
            <p>If then Holy Reaſon condemns all thoſe that Lodge, that Furniſh, that Apparel themſelves Magnificently, and of Gold, Marble, and other Precious things bewail their had Fortune, that Man makes uſe
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:61588:120"/>
of 'em to ſupport his Vanity, the ſame Reaſon ſhews us, That there is nothing he can do more worthy commendation, than to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>lee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 'em from that Servitude; by conſecrating 'em to God for the Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his publick Temples. For that then it is that he is not Magnificent for his own Name, but for the Honor of God. And therefore it was, that there was nothing more beautiful, nor ſo full of Grandeur, as that Fabrick rear'd by the wiſeſt of Kings, and Conſecrated to the Veneration of the Almighty; and therefore it is, that we ſee ſo many Glorious Temples erected to the Honour of Chriſt, which remain as ſo many Monuments of the Piety and Magnificence of Chriſtian Princes.</p>
            <p>The Examples of <hi>Judith</hi> and Queen <hi>Eſther</hi> make it appear, that they made a good uſe of their Vertue of Magnificence. For <hi>Judith</hi> who in her Widowhood cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her ſelf ſuitably to her Condition, laid aſide her Mourning Habit, and put on coſtly and magnificent Apparel to appear in all her Luſtre before <hi>Holofernes;</hi> that ſhe might have the fairer opportunity to give the ſtroak which God had reſerved for her Arm. And Queen <hi>Eſther,</hi> who
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:61588:120"/>
call'd the Crown that ſhe wore, <hi>The Sign of her High Eſtate, that ſhe abhorr'd,</hi> yet put it upon her Head, and preſented her Self to <hi>Ahaſhuerus,</hi> apparell'd and dreſs'd to preſerve her Nation.</p>
            <p>We have alſo learnt from the Conduct of the moſt Pious and Modeſt of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, That it is moſt proper for Soveraign Kings to make Preſents proper to the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur of their Dominions, to the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors of Princes their Allies; to make ſplendid and ſumptuous Banquets, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Treaties more ſolemn, and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificently to entertain thoſe Kings that came to viſit 'em, or that had occaſion to paſs through their Territories. And thus it was that <hi>St. Lewis</hi> received the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror <hi>Frederick</hi> at <hi>Campergne,</hi> where he order'd the Nobility of his Court to be pompouſly attir'd, and made himſelf a moſt Magnificent Entry. <q>This Holy and Devout Prince, ſays <hi>Mezerai,</hi> was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt, and an Enemy to Luxury in his own Perſon, and Pompous and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perb in his publick Ceremonies.</q> 
               <hi>Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main,</hi> tho for the moſt part went like the meaneſt of his ordinary Subjects; was moſt ſumptuouſly apparell'd when he gave Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:61588:121"/>
to Ambaſſadors, and gave a Crown glittering with Precious Stones. <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>Debonnaire</hi> obſerved the ſame Method. And the end which thoſe Religious Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces propos'd to themſelves upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, where they appear'd with ſo much ſplendor, was to give an <hi>Idea</hi> of the Strength and Riches of their Kingdoms, that other Kings might be afraid to invade their Territories, and by that means to ſecure the Repoſe of the People, that God had committed to their Charge.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Lawful employments of <hi>Magnificence,</hi> beſides which, there are none that can be ſerviceable to us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out perverting the Uſe of it, and beyond which, all the reſt is but vain Glory and Oſtentation. For tho <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> affirm that a ſumptuous Palace is an Ornament to the Founder, Certain it is, that tho all the Palaces of Kings belonged to Him, he would neither be the Greater, nor the more Magnificent; That his Glory and Magnificence, as the Holy Scripture teaches us, ought to be within himſelf; and that it conſiſts in the Uſe of theſe Vertues, with which his Soul ought to be adorn'd; ſo that as they who excell in Arts and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:61588:121"/>
are Famous without employments and preferments; So Men that excel in Vertues not to be found in other Men, are Magnificent without Houſes, without Retinues or coſtly Equipages; and we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence 'em for their own ſakes much more, than they that we behold, attended with numerous and gawdy Trains of Servants. <hi>He alone,</hi> ſaid <hi>Epicurus, is truly Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, who has no need of Magnificenee.</hi>

            <p>THE Poets could never tire them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with heaping Aggravations on the daring Boldneſs of thoſe that firſt attempted to croſs the Seas, and truſting to a few weak and eaſily broken Planks which they fix'd together between them and Death, forc'd their way through thoſe vaſt Abyſſes of Water.</p>
            <p>But for my part, I find thoſe to be far more bold, who firſt deſign'd living in Society together. And I am certain, that whoever does admire the daring Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſuch an Enterprize, never conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, or never underſtood the Nature of Man, ſo far from being endu'd with Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities proper for Union, that they make it their ſole Buſineſs to perſecute, tear in pieces, and deſtroy one another. In a word, A Great Aſſembly of Men is a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:61588:122"/>
Sea, more treacherous, and more tempeſtuous than the wild Ocean it ſelf. And let the Winds be never ſo impetuous and ſo innumerable, the Paſſions of Men ſurmount 'em in Number, in Contrariety, and Violence.</p>
            <p>Let us make good our Aſſertion, and affirm, That Men through their viciouſneſs being become the ſame that the moſt wild and ſavage Beaſts by Nature are, it was not an Enterprize ſo difficult to tame and civilize Bears, Tygers, and Lyons, as to Aſſemble Men together. There is alſo this difference, That the Cruelty of Brutes paſſes away with their Impetuoſity; that they fall upon Men through the Motives of a Blind Inſtinct, and that they do not underſtand the Art of Miſchief. Whereas Men keep their<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Reſentments a long time, that they weave and contrive Aſſaſſina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Murthers, to execute 'em with more ſecurity, and that they are ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to lay ſnares one for another.</p>
            <p>The ſame Conſiderations perhaps made the Poets firſt imagine, that when our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties were firſt eſtabliſh'd, and that they ſet up their firſt Common-weal, Juſtice deſcended from Heaven to prevent it from
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:61588:123"/>
becoming ſuddainly a dreadful Theater of Murthers, Aſſaſſinations, and Robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; for which reaſon they repreſent her with a Sword in her Hand, wherewith ſhe menaces the Wicked, and puniſhes bad Offenders, and Perſons daringly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt.</p>
            <p>This is as much as to ſay, that Juſtice is a Heavenly Vertue; whether we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it in the Perſons of Princes and Judges that diſpence it, or in the reſt of Men who make it the Rule of their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; or whether we conſider it in the Perſon of Good Men, who love and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly obey it; or in the Perſons of the Wicked, who obſerve her Laws through conſtraint and fear of Puniſhment; For the Fear of Puniſhment is the Wiſdom of the wicked, and the Vertue of thoſe that have none.</p>
            <p>This is the Opinion which all Men have conceiv'd of Juſtice. They believe that ſhe drew her Original from Heaven, and the Wiſeſt and moſt Underſtanding Perſons have given her high <hi>Encomiums.</hi> 
               <q>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue ſaid a <hi>Pythagorean,</hi> is a Divine Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, that under ſeveral Names Governs the World; and all the parts that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:61588:123"/>
it. For ſo long as ſhe maintains the World in order we give her the Name of Providence; The Name of <hi>Love,</hi> when ſhe Rules adviſedly Cities, Common-wealths and Kingdoms; And <hi>Vertue,</hi> when ſhe diſciplines Men into Order and Civil Converſation.</q> Laſtly, it is Vertue, ſays <hi>St. Auſtin,</hi> which has the priviledge to keep Men in ſubjection to God, and to prevent his Wrath from withdrawing us from under her Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>We muſt confeſs, that theſe <hi>Encomiums</hi> give us a fair <hi>Idea</hi> of this Vertue; and indeed we cannot imagine a more delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Spectacle than to ſee Men equally, zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, the one to preſs us to obſerve, the other eager to follow the Laws and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of Juſtice, out of a ſincere Love which they have for her. But where ſhall we find thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſincere Love of Juſtice? Shall we find it in Soveraign Princes, the moſt careful to uphold Juſtice within their Realms? What was that care of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan Emperors, and what was afterwards the ſame Care of the Chriſtian Princes, who only Govern'd themſelves by the Maxims and Spirit of Chriſtianity; but
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:61588:124"/>
an ardent deſire of Raigning, and a piece of Policy purely Human? What was it in ſeveral Others, but their Natural haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs, which not enduring thoſe that ad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ventur'd to raiſe Rebellions, and to De<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>clare War againſt 'em, puniſh'd thoſe bold Attempters with utmoſt ſeverity? Is it not in others a love of their Repoſe, which makes 'em ſo diligent to ſtifle ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Enterprizes, and ſo exact to execute the Rigor of the Laws upon the Heads of Sedition? Nor is it impoſſible but that in ſome it may be an eager Deſire to obtain the <hi>Sirname,</hi> of <hi>Juſt.</hi> For thô the Love of Titles be an Ambition very frivilous, yet is it to be reck on'd among Human Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; in regard that Man is vain and frivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to that Degree which is not to be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined. Of which <hi>Auguſtus</hi> was an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Proof, who wept for joy, when the Senate gave him the Title of <hi>Father of his Countrey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Integrity of Magiſtrates is a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Affectation of Reputation, or a deſire to prefer themſelves to higher Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. For as Self Love engages Men to make their Vices and their Vertues ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their Intereſt; Hence it comes to
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:61588:124"/>
paſs that corrupt Judges do juſtice to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich themſelves, others to gain the eſteem of the World, and that their Soveraigns may deem 'em worthy of higher Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments.</p>
            <p>The Juſtice of private Perſons moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act and careful of doing wrong or injury to their Neighbours, is a fear of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliated with the fame injuries that they do to others. For Man that ſees himſelf engag'd in Society among Men, lives there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in with more Caution and Fear, than if he were in the midſt of a Forreſt full of Wild Beaſts; for he is not only afraid of his Life, but of his Quiet, and his Repn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Beſides, that the Oppreſſions, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olences, and Murders, which he ſees com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted every day, redouble his Terrors; ſo that while he continually meditates how to ſecure himſelf from the accidents that threaten him; he finds no better means than to obſerve the Laws of others, in reſpect of others; and that upon good grounds; For he that behaves himſelf to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards others with ſo much circumſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that he never prejudices any of their Intereſts or Concerns, obliges them for their own Reputation to let him live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:61588:125"/>
diſturbance, in peace and quiet. And beſides, Men have not the heart to harm or injure a Perſon that behaves himſelf peaceably and juſtly toward all the World. Men of Juſtice make deep impreſſions of Reverence in others, that we dare no more preſume to touch their Honour, than the Conſecrated Veſſels of a Temple.</p>
            <p>Thus the Juſtice of Private Men is no more than a kind of Politick reſerv'dneſs to ſecure their Lives, their Eſtates, and their Honors from injury and violence. <q>Wherefore, ſays <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> We muſt not be precipitate in our Judgments, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing ſlightly as we do, that he who performs Acts of Juſtice, is always a Juſt Man. Juſt and equitable Actions deceive us, ſays <hi>Plato,</hi> becauſe we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive this conſequence from thence, That they who are upright, are lovers of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and are endued with better Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations than other Men; For they are no leſs covetous and violent than others, only they put a force upon themſelves, and do no injury to any one, leſt any perſon ſhould do injury to them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:61588:125"/>
The Juſtice of the Philoſophers, was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a deſire to diſtinguiſh themſelves from all other Men, by the uprightneſs of their Dealings, and to ſhew that only they liv'd according to the Rules of Right Reaſon.</p>
            <p>The Juſtice of the Jews, who only act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Spirit of the Law, was only a Fear leſt God ſhould withdraw his Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from 'em, deliver 'em into the hands of their Enemies, and blaſt their Corn-Fields and their Vineyards.</p>
            <p>There is not therefore any Juſtice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Men, ſince there is not any one that obſerves her for the Love of her ſelf; but in Soveraign Princes that defend and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect it, in Judges that adminiſter it, in private People that exerciſe it, it has no other foundation than that of Intereſt and Ambition, ſince it was no more than Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity among the Philoſophers, and in her moſt zealous Admirers among the Jews, a ſervile and intereſted Fear.</p>
            <p>It was not therefore without reaſon, that the Ancient Poets, whom <hi>Lactantius</hi> calls the <hi>Firſt Sages</hi> of the World, complain'd that Juſtice was return'd to Heaven, and frequently wont to cry out,</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="232" facs="tcp:61588:126"/>
Deſeruit properè terras ſanctiſſima Virgo.</q>
            <p>For they made not their Complaints and Exclamations to any other end, but this Divine Vertue is no longer now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining among Men. The Fables alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us the Truth of this; and the ſhort continuance of the Age of Gold, and <hi>Saturns</hi> Raign, with which ended the Raign of Fidelity and Juſtice, clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate, that Juſtice did not long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue upon Earth; and that after ſhe was baniſh'd, it was only through Ambition, or Intereſt, or Fear, that they who call'd themſelves Juſt, abſtain'd from doing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to others. And this Truth is farther alſo confirm'd by the frequent wiſhes and ſighs of the Prophets, and Patriarchs, by which they conjur'd the <hi>Heavens to drop down, and the Skie to pour down Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Heaven therefore it is that inſpires all true Chriſtians with Juſtice, which diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers to 'em the Beauty of that Celeſtial Vertue which attracts the Souls of all Men. To them it is that Heaven ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it more pleaſing, and delicious
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:61588:126"/>
than Honey, and more precious than all the Treaſures of the World, 'Tis only in their Minds that he cauſes this Divine Light to ſhine, which inſtructs 'em, that his Will is the Rule of all their Duty, and that we are no longer Juſt, than while we conform and ſubmit to that. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore none but true Chriſtians are truly Juſt, either before God or before Men. <q>I would have all the World to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, ſays <hi>Plato,</hi> That no Men are Juſt through their own Natural Inclinations, and that they cannot love Juſtice with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the particular aſſiſtance of God.</q>

            <p>
               <hi>HOneſty,</hi> ſays <hi>Guarini, Is but the Art of appearing Honeſt.</hi> But the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which the Poet gives of the Hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty of Women, is very unjuſt. For in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard his Intention is not to tax their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, becauſe that moſt commonly it is through their Pride, and not through any commendable motive of Vertue that they continue honeſt; and for that it is only of their External Honeſty of which he diſcourſes; it is therefore falſe, that this Honeſty is only an Art of appearing Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, in regard we find that a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Women are effectually ſo; among whom there are ſome ſo modeſt, that it would be impoſſible to wound their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:61588:127"/>
to tempt 'em to betray their Chaſtity, tho they were aſſur'd that their failings could never come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the World. Therefore this Cenſure of his had been better grounded, had he apply'd it to the Honeſty and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity of Men. For it is no leſs rare, to ſee People ſo equally Religious, as well to act nothing contrary to Integrity when they are in private, as when they have many Witneſſes of their actions; than it is to find valiant Men, that aſſault or repell the Enemy with the ſame Valour by Night as they do by Day in the ſight of their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. It is alſo very rare to find out Men ſo ſetled and reſolute in their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, as neither to be ſhaken by Threats, or tempted by Promiſes; or ſo powerful over themſelves, as to reſiſt the force of their Paſſions. And to be convinc'd that there are none ſuch, A Man need only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon all the actions of his Life, and conſider whether any Intereſt of Hatred, of Revenge, of Love or Ambition, had never ſo much power over him as to make him forfeit his Fidelity and Integrity; Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it never happen'd, That to gratify a Woman whom he idoliz'd, he reveal'd a
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:61588:128"/>
ecret of Importance that was entruſted in his Boſom; Whether the fear of falling into Diſgrace with a Favourite at Court, never hindred him to teſtify the Truth, when his Teſtimony was requir'd to ſave the Reputation of a Perſon accus'd; Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Whether Jealouſie had never provok'd him to leſſen the Merit of a Noble Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with the beſt of his Friends perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Battel. Certain I am, that if Men will but ſeriouſly examine themſelves, few or none will be found innocent, and that muſt not be forc'd to acknowledge, that he has often fail'd in his Integrity, when he could do it without fear of Shame or Puniſhment, and that it redounded to his Advantage.</p>
            <p>But tho we ſhould Grant that there are ſome Perſons whoſe Integrity is not to be corrupted; viſible it is, that the Motives which excite 'em to the practiſe of it, will not ſuffer us to number it among the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Qualities; becauſe the Motives are altogether Human, and the chiefeſt of all is a criminal Ambition.</p>
            <p>Now to ſhew what ſort of Ambition it is, we muſt obſerve that the real Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of a Man over-rul'd by his Self-Love,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:61588:128"/>
deſires that his Wit ſhould ſurpaſs the Wit of all other Men, that every thing ſhould yield to the ſtrength of his Arm, and that all Men in general ſhould ſubmit to him. But finding in himſelf, and in other Men, an infinite number of Obſtacles that oppoſe his Deſire, he Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles and conceals it, as he ſees more or leſs opportunity to ſatisfy it; and when he meets with none at all, he moderates and reduces himſelf to wiſh that he may only keep a conſiderable rank among thoſe, of whom he cannot make himſelf the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. Hence it comes to paſs, that Great Perſonages labour to aggrandize them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſtill more and more, and when they find it impoſſible, they value themſelves upon the Nobility of their Birth, and Teat the re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t of Men as if they were a Degree lower than they. There upon they who have no Deſcent to boaſt of, labour i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity.</p>
            <p>They who exactly obſerve the Rules of Honeſty, obſerve not only; that all the World agrees to rank 'em above others, through the neceſſity which they have of 'em, but they alſo find that Perſons of Honor and Honeſty are very rare; and this ſame ſcarcity is the reaſon by whom they deſire to be moſt eſteem'd, ſeek our their Company, and deſire 'em for their Friends and Confidents; and that it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry requiſite for 'em to preſerve their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree and their Priviledges.</p>
            <p>They alſo obſerve that there is nothing ſo publickly branded and ignomimous, as diſcovered Knavery and Falſhood, and that they who are once found guilty of ſuch Actions, never regain their Credit.</p>
            <p>They find moreover, That tho Perſons of Quality proſper not ſo frequently in the World, as Perſons corrupt and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted; nevertheleſs, that the ſucceſs of Knavery and Treachery is not always in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, that they are not rewarded every day; and that when they are, they that gain by their wickedneſs, pay for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:61588:129"/>
which they reap by the Treaſon, but abominate the Traitors.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe Conſiderations is grounded the Integrity of thoſe, of whom we ſay, that they have Honeſt Souls. Intereſt produces the Integrity of Low and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary People, and it is only a deſire of Profit.</p>
            <p>Some Perſons deny that the Principle of <hi>Probity</hi> in Honeſt Men, is an Ambition to be eminent, without either Preferment or Dignity; but only to keep up a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Credit among Men: For that there are many People who practiſe both Fidelity and Integrity in private, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they act out of Integrity, and not out of any deſire to be Honor'd and eſteem'd of Men. To which we anſwer with <hi>St. Thomas,</hi> That there are ſome Men ſo happy in their compoſitions, that their very Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of Body enclines 'em to Uprightneſs. In the next place, he who performs acts of Integrity, tho he conceal his Actions from the knowledge of the World, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms 'em out of a real deſire to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded by all the World. And to make the <hi>Paradox</hi> out, we muſt underſtand that Men are ſo Vain-glorious, and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:61588:130"/>
of Praiſe, that the moſt excellent parts of Knowledge and the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Vertues pleaſe, them only, proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably to the Eſteem and Applauſe which they bring them. And therefore we may ſay, that in the Breaſts of all thoſe that are endu'd with extraordinary Vertues, there is one ſort of Ambition reſembling that of Victorious Captains, and that both the one and the other, aim in their way at the Conqueſt of Human Kind, with this difference, That Conquerors labour to ſubdue all Men, to be Maſters of their Eſtates and Liberties: Whereas they who are endu'd with rare and ſingular Vertues, ſtudy to poſſeſs the firſt place in the eſteem of the Vanquiſh'd. But the Philoſophers, who were the Firſt in whom this Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on appear'd, deeming it impoſſible to gain the approbation of all the World, (becauſe the moſt part of Men have very little judgment, and are moreover Capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and Unjuſt,) they bounded the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of Wiſdom to be content with the Approbation of Men Judicious, Equita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Vertuous. Afterwards obſerving that it was a difficult thing to gain the Appobation of <hi>Many,</hi> in regard the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:61588:130"/>
of Judgments is as various as that of Taſts; they thought it enough for a Wiſe Man to have the Approbation of one ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Perſon, provided he be a Perſon of a clear and ſolid Judgment, and in Credit with all honeſt Men. <hi>One ſingle Perſon,</hi> ſaid <hi>Democritus, is worth a multitude.</hi> 
               <q>We flatter our ſelves more, ſaid <hi>Epicurus,</hi> writing to one of his Friends, with the eſteem which we have one for another, then with all the Acclamations of the People.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This Opinion ſeem'd beſt to the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, even till <hi>Seneca</hi>'s time, who beſt underſtanding what was moſt proper to gratify the Pride of Man, pronounc'd, That a Wiſe Man being capable alone to judge of the Merit of Actions, was the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſon fit to be Judge of himſelf, and that he had no need of any other Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation. <q>A Wiſe Man, ſaid he, ceaſes not to be perfectly contented, tho he has no witneſs of his Actions; for what mony of himſelf, and to be the Object of his own Admiration?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="242" facs="tcp:61588:131"/>
All which clearly demonſtrates, that he who performs Acts of Integrity unknown to the World, performs 'em out of a real deſire of applauſe, ſeeing that his ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Paſſion being to be approv'd by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he ſeeks after that Approbation which is to him moſt grateful, and which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers before all publick Applauſes. Althô Glory conſiſts not in the praiſe of a ſingle Perſon, ſaid <hi>Saluſt,</hi> Yet there are certain Perſons, ſaid <hi>St. Thomas,</hi> that eſtabliſh their own Honor upon their own Eſteem. 'Tis true, theſe Perſons are very ſcarce, and if they do perform any private acts of Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, they nouriſh a conceal'd Hope that ſome favourable Hazard will bring 'em to light.</p>
            <p>'Tis not then Integrity, but the Enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium's given to Integrity which Men af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; nor do evil Actions diſpleaſe 'em; but they diſlike 'em becauſe they ruine their Reputation: And therefore when they are accus'd to have committed any ill Act, to the prejudice of Integrity, tho they know in their Conſciences that they are guilty, they implore the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of their Friends, and try all the ways imaginable to juſtify themſelves. We
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:61588:131"/>
hear of ſeveral Magiſtrates, ſays <hi>Plato,</hi> who ſell Juſtice, and privately take Bribes; but we ſhall never find one that will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs he has taken a Bribe; or that being accus'd of it, can patiently endure his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation.</p>
            <p>Let us then confeſs, to the Glory of God, That it is he alone that infuſes <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſty</hi> into Men, and that he alone is the only Caeleſtial Fountain of Integrity. For He, uniting 'em in the Bonds of Charity, puts 'em into ſuch a Condition, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible they ſhould falſify their Word and Fidelity, or not acquit themſelves of the ſeveral Duties which they owe one to another. And there is no doubt but the ſoftneſs and force of this Tye, can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain and hinder 'em from Deceit and Treachery. The Bands of Human Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip are too weak to reſiſt the violence of his Paſſions; and too often we meet with ambitious Men, that underhand croſs the deſigns of their beſt Friends, and who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they have promis'd 'em the utmoſt of their aſſiſtances for the obtaining an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, uſe all their Endeavours, and employ all their Craft and Cunning to deprive 'em of it. <q>There is no ſolid In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:61588:132"/>
ſays <hi>Plato,</hi> but that which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with Piety and Holineſs. Perfect Honeſty, ſays <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> is that which we practiſe out of a conſideration of things Divine and Eternal.</q>

            <head>CHAP. XIII. <hi>Loyalty of Subjects towards their SOVERAIGN.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <hi>HOW wonderful are thy Works O God,</hi> the Prophet cry'd out in the Tranſports of his Admiration, when he beheld the ſeveral Wonders and Maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieces of the Deity, that adorn'd the ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious World. In his Extaſie to view ſo great a number of Creatures, their Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, their Riches, and their different Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities. But their Magnificence was not the ſole cauſe of his Admiration; For what he adds, <hi>Thou haſt made all theſe things in Wiſdom</hi> ſhews, that he was equally raviſht with that wonderful Order which God had ſetl'd among 'em. Seeing that after he had Created thoſe various Beings, if he had not regulated their Motions, the
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:61588:133"/>
World which was to be a perfect piece of Workmanſhip, to make known to us by its own, the Perfection of the Creator, would have prov'd nothing but Diſorder and Confuſion.</p>
            <p>If Order then, without which the World would have been a <hi>Chaos,</hi> appear'd ſo Lovely and ſo Admirable, the Secret which the Wiſdom of God found out to eſtabliſh it, was no leſs worthy of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. For he made the Creatures un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal in their Perfection, to the end, the leſs Perfect might depend upon the more Excellent, and appointed to every one a Place ſuitable to the Degree of its Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. To this end he plac'd the Sun in the midſt of the Heavens, that he might diffuſe his Light over all parts of the World; that his enliv'ning Heat might contribute to the Birth, the Growth, and the Preſervation of Plants, of Animals, and Men, and that the Earth might every year be renew'd by his Influencies.</p>
            <p>God has obſerv'd the ſame Method in reſpect of Men, he has ordain'd 'em to be Born, different in their Condition; he has rais'd ſome to a degree above others; and has order'd the Repoſe, the Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:61588:133"/>
and the Happineſs of thoſe whom he has plac'd in ſubjection to depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the continual Cares and Vigilance of thoſe whom he has appointed for their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors: So that we may ſay, That as the Sun is the Eye with which all Men See, and without whoſe Light our Eyes would be uſeleſs to us; in like manner our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Prince is the Eye of his Realm; and ſuch an Eye that continually enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens his Subjects, ſo that without that Light they would always be groping and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring in the Dark.</p>
            <p>This Order of Divine Wiſdom it is, that ſubjects the Multitude to one ſingle Perſon, which <hi>Plato</hi> conſidering, it made him wiſh, That as God was the ſole Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of the World, that all Men were under one Prince. <q>Mankind, ſaid he, will never be truly and really happy, till they come under the Conduct of one ſole Monarch: Then all the unhappy Cauſes of War ceaſe altogether. No longer then ſhall Intereſt, Jealouſie and Ambition Arm Soveraign Princes one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt another. No longer then ſhall we hear the Moans of People, that in ſo many places groan under the Dominion
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:61588:134"/>
of Tyrants, that oppreſs and deſpoil 'em of their Eſtates: No longer ſhall the Wicked, the Perfidious, the Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous find Sanctuary in Foreign King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms. For then ſo many different Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhall be but as one Family which this ſame King, and only Father, ſhall love with a tender Affection, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich with his Favours and Bleſſings.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But God not only binds Subjects to their Soveraign, by that ſame Intereſt which obliges 'em to Obedience; for knowing well the Blindneſs and Inconſtancy of Men, he found this Tye would not be ſtrong enough; therefore he has engag'd 'em to Submiſſion by the obligation of Conſcience, and has made it a Religious Duty to be Loyal and Obedient to Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Princes. He has alſo ſo clearly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd this Duty in ſo many places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, that it is viſible he deſign'd to take away all pretences of its Violation; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Declar'd, that neither the evil Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, nor the ſevere Government of Kings, ſhall be any ground for Subjects to revolt from their Obedience. And it was neceſſary that God ſhould ſo Declare himſelf. For that Fidelity which tyes
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:61588:134"/>
Subjects to their lawful Princes, being the only cauſe of the Tranquility of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and Empires, had God left 'em at their liberty to withdraw themſelves from their Subjection upon all occaſions, he had expos'd Kingly Government to the raſhneſs of the Judgments of every one, and their Dominions to frequent Revolutions; and had he not rank'd in the number of his Laws, the obligation of Obedience to Princes, they could hardly have aſſur'd themſelves of the Fidelity of their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; for that the Diſpoſitions of Men frequently alter, and for that their Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Inconſtancy, and variety of Intereſts are ſuch, that they cannot anſwer for themſelves. And this Fidelity thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd, is an Obligation which God has laid upon us, not to be broken for the ſake of any Intereſt, nor to be diſpenc'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al by any Authority, nor upon any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence whatever.</p>
            <p>Great Politicians demand how Subjects ought to demean themſelves, when Kings in their Treaties violate the Fundamental Laws of Monarchy. For example, What ſhould the <hi>French</hi> have done, had <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt, been obſtinate in obſerving the
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:61588:135"/>
Treaty which he made at <hi>Madrid;</hi> by which he was engag'd to ſurrender <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy</hi> to <hi>Charles</hi> the V.</p>
            <p>To this, one of the moſt Learned and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh'd Politicians of our age makes anſwer, <q>That upon thoſe occaſions it ought to be the firſt Duty of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, to divert the King from his Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Petitions, and Remonſtrances; of which, if the King takes no notice, What can the Subject do more, but only receive his Commands, and his Orders, but forbear to put 'em in execution?</q> Which was the Courſe which the <hi>French</hi> men took in reference to <hi>Francis</hi> the I. After that, the ſame Author adds, <q>That if it ſhould happen, he ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to win by force, what he could not gain by fair means, and violently ſeek to conſtrain thoſe that would not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly follow him, What ſhould they do in ſuch a ſtrange Conjuncture? Shall they ſubmit to the violence that threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens to overwhelm 'em, or ſhall they riſe up in oppoſition? Shall they ſubmit or reſiſt? Shall they deſert the common Good of the Publick, or make War, not againſt the Prince, for that is not lawful,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:61588:135"/>
but againſt the Will of the Prince? Which being certain Precipices, into which we muſt of neceſſity fall, and the Malignity of the raigning Conſtellation not being byany means to be appeas'd; What can they do but have recourſe to their Arms, and call to their aſſiſtance the firſt Light of Nature, which is Self-Preſervation?</q>
            </p>
            <p>This Caſe thus reſolv'd by a Perſon of ſo ſolid and clear a judgment, makes me think, that the Chriſtians in reſpect of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Reaſon are no more then what the Pagans were, in reſpect to the Oracles of their falſe Deities. Thoſe Oracles thought it their beſt courſe to cheat and delude the People, by the Obſcurity and Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity of their Anſwers. In like manner, How experienc'd ſoever the Chriſtians may be, that the determinations of Reaſon are deceiful and uncertain, they cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear conſulting it, and nothing is able to make 'em ſenſible of their Error in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiding in it. And that for which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be blam'd in an extraordinary manner, is this, That the Oracle of the Holy Spirit, which is the only infallible Oracle curſes Man that confides in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and who puts his Strength in his
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:61588:136"/>
Weakneſs, that is to ſay, Who relies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Reaſon, and prefers the crooked and dangerous Turnings which that diſcovers, before the ſure, ſtraight, and only Path which is taught us by the Law of God. Thus we find that Politicians are always floating and divided in their Judgments; never uniform in their Reſolutions, while the plain well-meaning Perſon that puts his confidence in God; and guides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf according to his Promiſes, walks with aſſurance. <hi>For the way of the Lord is the ſtrength of the ſimple,</hi> ſaith the Scripture. And now let us apply this to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>When Princes by their Treaties have parted with Cities of Importance, or ſome conſiderable Province; upon ſuch occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions what do the People do that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume upon themſelves? They conſume and evaporate themſelves in vain Reaſons; they cry out, That the Subjects have a right to oppoſe themſelves againſt ſuch Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and that they are not oblig'd to act as Subjects, where the King refuſes to act as a Soveraign; they meaſure the extent of Royal Power, and that of their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſtretch 'em out, and ſhorten 'em
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:61588:136"/>
according to the diverſity of their Thoughts; they enquire into the Rights and Prerogatives of Soveraigns, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to ſet up the Priviledges that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has given us. But what does the plain down-right Perſon do? He walks in the way that the Law of God has mark'd out; that Commands him to obey the King; he Obeys, while they endeavour to draw him out of the way by ſpecious Reaſons; they tell him the Prince goes about to ranvers a Fundamental Law of Monarchy; but he believes himſelf not able to give his Judgment in ſo difficult a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; only he knows that Human Reaſon deceives us every day, but that the Law of God cannot deceive us. <q>A Man of Underſtanding, ſays the Scripture, truſts in the Law, and the Law is faithful to him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This Behaviour of a down-right Perſon, that is of a Good Man and a Chriſtian, is not only the moſt ſafe in point of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, but the moſt Juſt and Rational. For as it is impoſſible for Subjects rightly to underſtand the Caſe of Affairs, it is as impoſſible altogether for them to judge, whether it be profitable or prejudicial, to
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:61588:137"/>
cut off a Province from the Body of the Realm; and as for the general Knowledge of this Matter, it obliges 'em altogether to Obedience. For they know that one Province may be given in exchange for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other nearer and more commodious, or Surrender'd either for the prevention, or putting an end to ſome Great War. They are alſo well inſtructed, that they have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do to deſcant upon the Actions of their Soveraigns; and that they ought not to cenſure their Government without a misbeſeeming Audaciouſneſs. <q>It is not lawful for Subjects, ſays <hi>Tacitus,</hi> to condemn the Actions of Kings, nor to enquire into the hidden Reaſons, and Myſteries of their Conduct: The Gods have made 'em Arbitrers of the Affairs and Deſigns of Empires; and have only left us the Honor to Obey. Beſides, have the Subjects any reaſon to complain, that their Rights are invaded by the Surrender of a Province?</q> Does the Kingdom belong to them? Is it not the Patrimony of our Princes? Have they not won by the Sword the greateſt part of the Provinces that compoſe it? Four of our Firſt Kings, eſpecially <hi>Clouis?</hi> did not
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:61588:137"/>
they alone conquer the greateſt part of <hi>France?</hi> and is it not by Purchaſe, by Donations and Matches, that the reſt of the Provinces are come to the Crown? And therefore eſpecially in Hereditary Kingdoms, it is no ſuch unjuſt thing for a Prince to alienate ſome part of his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. Beſides that, we are always to take it for Granted, that they never do it but when compell'd by neceſſity; or that they find a conſiderable advantage by it.</p>
            <p>The oppoſition of the <hi>French</hi> to the Treaty which <hi>Charles</hi> the VI, made with <hi>Henry</hi> the V. King of <hi>England,</hi> and the War wherein they engag'd to prevent the Effects, are proofs already without any appearance of Reaſon, that Subjects ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times may oppoſe by force the Will of their Soveraign. For how can we ſay that the <hi>French</hi> upon that occaſion, took up Arms againſt <hi>Charles</hi> VI. or what Validity could they imagine to be in a Treaty made when the Prince was troubl'd in his Mind, and by which his Son was depriv'd of the Crown, which was his Right. In a word, the Ambition of <hi>Henry</hi> V. the Revenge of the Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and Queen <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi> of <hi>Bavaria</hi>'s hatred of the <hi>Dolphin,</hi>
               <pb n="256" facs="tcp:61588:138"/>
were the true and only Cauſes of that Treaty. So that there never was a War more juſt then that which the <hi>French</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into, as being againſt the Uſurper of the Kingdom; and for that they took part with <hi>Charles</hi> VII. who was not only Succeſſor, but in Poſſeſſion, and Maſter of the Kingdom, his Father being civilly Dead, and not in a Condition ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Treat or meddle with any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Affairs.</p>
            <p>As for the reſiſtance of the <hi>French</hi> to the execution of the Treaty of <hi>Madrid</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Burgundy,</hi> It is viſible that <hi>Francis</hi> I. might eaſily have ſurmounted it, but that he cheriſh'd it, that he might have a pretence for the not obſerving a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſo diſadvantageous. It is viſible that he left <hi>Spain</hi> with a Reſolution to break it; for ſo ſoon as he return'd into his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, he ſummon'd an Aſſembly of the <hi>Eſtates</hi> to meet at <hi>Angouleſme,</hi> where after he had proteſted in the preſence of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi> (the Emperors Creature) That for his part he deſir'd to obſerve the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty punctually, he ſubmitted to the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on the other ſide, that it was not in his Power to perform it; for that by
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:61588:138"/>
the Fundamental Laws of Monarchy, Kings could not alienate any Right or Inheritance that belong'd to the Crown; and that having receiv'd the Monarchy entire from his Anceſtors, he was oblig'd to leave it entire to his Succeſſors. And of this Men may be ſoon convinc'd, if they conſider, that <hi>Charles</hi> the VI. a Prince of leſs Courage, leſs Formidable, and of leſs Authority then <hi>Francis</hi> I. laugh'd at an oppoſition of the ſame Nature; and that <hi>Francis</hi> I. by the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Cambray,</hi> which was an <hi>Alloy</hi> to to that of <hi>Madrid,</hi> renounc'd his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions to <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Artois,</hi> and the Right which he had to <hi>Milan,</hi> and the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> contrary to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions taken by the <hi>General Eſtates,</hi> and contrary to the Fundamental <hi>Laws</hi> of Monarchy. True it is, that theſe Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ought to be grounded upon ſome lawful Reaſon; and that King's would injure their Succeſſors; if they parted with any Province from the Body of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, without being conſtrained: But when they condeſcend to thoſe Retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments only by compulſion, or for the good of the Kingdom, their Subjects have
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:61588:139"/>
no reaſon to complain; or, if they had, the greateſt part of our Kings had more reaſon to complain of their Predeceſſors, particularly of the Children of <hi>Henry</hi> II. who by the Treaty of <hi>Careau-Cambre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> reſtored near Two hundred Cities, or ſtrong Holds to the other Party.</p>
            <p>To this we muſt add, that it is a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult thing to obſerve that point of Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, alledg'd by the fore-mention'd Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor; that when Dominions are united, it is not lawful for kings to part with any parcel thereof; becauſe it is not long ſince the ſettlement of our Monarchs, that <hi>France</hi> has been enlarg'd by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts of our Kings, or been leſſen'd by thoſe of our Neighbours. Moreover, the Princes of the Firſt and Second Race have frequently diminiſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d its Grandeur, by dividing it among their Children into ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Kingdoms. Laſtly, not to mention all the Provinces that have been diſunited from the Crown, it will be ſufficient to remark, that <hi>Burgundy</hi> was diſunited by <hi>Henry</hi> the younger Son of <hi>Hugh Capet,</hi> in favour of <hi>Robert</hi> his Brother, that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to the Crown under King <hi>John,</hi> who gave it in a ſhort time after to <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi>
               <pb n="259" facs="tcp:61588:139"/>
the <hi>Bold,</hi> his Fourth Son, and after the death of <hi>Charles,</hi> the laſt Duke of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy, Lewis</hi> the XI. made himſelf Maſter of it, ſo that it had not been re-united to the Crown above Fifty years, when <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> I. was inclinable to have reſtor'd it back again.</p>
            <p>Let us proceed to thoſe other Pretences for diſpenſing with our Loyalty to our Soveraigns. Religion, the Reformation of the Kingdom, and the grievances of Impoſitions, are the pretences moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently made uſe of to debauch the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject into Conſpiracies and Factions. But a Loyal Subject ought to be careful of being deluded by ſpecious Pretences, and to have always before his Eyes the ſaying of <hi>Tacitus,</hi> 
               <q>That <hi>Liberty,</hi> and <hi>Eaſe of the People</hi> are ſpecious Words which the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious make uſe of to withdraw Subjects from their Obedience.</q> Therefore to thoſe that complain of the burthen of Taxes and Subſidies, we muſt anſwer, That God not only Commands Obedience to Princes that Govern their Subjects with Lenity and Mildneſs; but alſo to thoſe that trample upon their Necks, and make an ill uſe of their Power. To thoſe that
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:61588:140"/>
Pretend Reformation of State, we are to affirm, that Diſorder is not the way to Order, nor is the Cure of a diſtemper'd Kingdom to be wrought by ſuch a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and dangerous Remedy as War, which is a Remedy far worſe then the Diſtemper, which they pretend to heal; or, then they can pretend to have ſuffer'd for ſeveral years together.</p>
            <p>The pretence of Religion is the moſt predominant of all; and whenever the Politic Heads of Factions pretend to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their Ambition with that fair pretence, they fail not of wonderful ſucceſs; Under this Veil were conceal'd the great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and Deſigns of the Houſe of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> when the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> form'd that famous League againſt <hi>Henry</hi> III. And, the reaſon it got to ſuch a head in ſo ſhort a time: and therefore we find that it was the principal and continual care of the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> and after him of the Duke of <hi>Maine,</hi> to imprint in the Minds of the People, by the means of the Religious Orders, that Preach'd to 'em, and govern'd their Conſciences, that <hi>Henry</hi> III. favour'd the <hi>Hugonots</hi> under-hand; and reduc'd the King to ſuch a condition, that he was forc'd
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:61588:140"/>
to League himſelf with the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre,</hi> with whom he was no ſooner agreed, but happen'd the deadly Blow at <hi>St. Clou.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The pretence of Religion had the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to engage a prodigious number of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Quality and Worth in that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious League, and to kindle a War both in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany;</hi> not only through the Induſtry of the Nobility, who made uſe of it to bring about their own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns; but alſo through Ignorance of the principal Maxims of our Religion; of which, this is one of great Importance; That we ought not to do an ill thing, to procure a certain Good, or to avoid an Evil. Now to rebel againſt our lawful Soveraign, is viſibly Evil; therefore we ought not to Rebel in hopes of any Good whatever, nor for fear of any Damage or Evil that may enſue. And we muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that how terrible ſoever thoſe Misfortunes are intended, we are like to fall into, they are beneath the wounding of our Conſciences.</p>
            <p>This Religious ſubmiſſion to thoſe whom God has ſet over us, remarkably appear'd among the Chriſtians of the Four firſt Ages, who never ſwerv'd from their
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:61588:141"/>
Obedience to the Pagan Emperors; no, not from thoſe that furiouſly perſecuted both them and their Religion, that ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died their Extirpation, and put 'em to death with innumerable Torments. And which was a greater wonder, that ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral were the Emperor's Domeſtick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, ſeveral that had great Preferments at Court, and ſo great a number that ſerv'd 'em in the Field, that <hi>Diocleſian</hi> had no leſs then Thirty thouſand in his Army. They that were the Emperor's Servants ſerv'd him with Reſpect, Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Fidelity; and they that were Liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their Armies, fought with ſo much zeal for the preſervation of the Empire, that <hi>St. Sebaſtian,</hi> one of the Captains of <hi>Diocleſian</hi>'s Guard, reproaching his Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty toward the Chriſtians, <hi>Thou exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeſt thy Fury,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>upon thy beſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, upon People that every day pray for thy Proſperity, and the ſafety of the Empire.</hi> St. <hi>Romulus,</hi> Grand Maſter of <hi>Trojan</hi>'s Houſhold, tax'd the Emperor in the ſame manner when he disbanded Eleven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Chriſtians, and baniſh'd 'em into <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia;</hi> and boldly reprov'd him for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:61588:141"/>
himſelf of the ſtouteſt, and moſt faithful Soldiers in his Army.</p>
            <p>Now in regard the Form of the Oath which the Chriſtians took, when they were enroll'd, cannot be thought imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to our purpoſe; I thought it not amiſs to recite it here, as we find it in <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>We oblige our ſelves in the Name of God, of Chriſt, the Holy Ghoſt, and his Imperial Majeſty, whom it behoves us to Honour next to God, to be faithful to the Emperor, to obey his Commands, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to deſert our Colours, or refuſe to dye, upon all occaſions that call us to defend the publick Weal.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This Form was admitted by all the Emperors, till the Reign of <hi>Maximian Hercules,</hi> who alter'd it, and Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all his Soldiers to ſwear upon the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars of his falſe Gods, that they would Fight couragiouſly againſt all that oppos'd his March. That Order was no ſooner brought to the <hi>Theban L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gion,</hi> conſiſting of Six thouſand ſix hundred Chriſtians, but they left the Camp, and ſet up their Standards about three Leagues off. The Emperor underſtanding what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:61588:142"/>
ſummon'd 'em to return, and rejoyn the Body of the Army. But <hi>St. Mauri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> who Commanded that famous Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, made anſwer to the Meſſenger, That he and his fellow Soldiers, were ready to expoſe their Lives in the Emperors Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; but that being Chriſtians, they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd no other Deity then the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God;</hi> and therefore could perform no Religious Act before inanimate Idols. <hi>Maximian</hi> having heard their Anſwer, commanded the whole Legion to be De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimated, and every tenth Man to be put to death; which not prevailing to ſhake the Reſolutions, either of the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders or Soldiers, he order'd a ſecond Decimation; but proving altogether as ineffectual, in a fury he let looſe his whole Army upon thoſe innocent People, and Maſſacr'd every Mothers Son. <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Tours</hi> writes, That the Memory of theſe Chriſtians, and generous Warriours was Honour'd in the Ancient Church; and that there was a great Concourſe of Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims to the Place, where they ſuffer'd.</p>
            <p>I have given this Portraicture of the Primitive Chriſtians, that the Chriſtians of our time may therein, as in a Mirror, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:61588:142"/>
the juſt Condemnation of their own Sentiments and Behaviours; that they may learn from thence, That the <hi>French,</hi> who made war againſt <hi>Henry</hi> III. becauſe they thought him a <hi>Hugonot,</hi> and afterwards oppoſed <hi>Henry</hi> IV. becauſe he was real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo, were guilty of High Treaſon, both Divine and Human; and Laſtly, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince 'em, That there is no difference of Religion, no Tiranny of Government, no Intereſt, no Reaſon, no Pretence what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that can juſtify Rebellion. <q>Wiſe Men, ſays <hi>Tacitus,</hi> patiently endure the Government of bad Princes, like the Influences of evil Conſtellations; and look upon Oppreſſion, Proſcription, Poyſoning, and thoſe other Effects of their Cruelty, as Famine, Peſtilence, and other Misfortunes that proceed from the ill temper of the Air.</q> We ought to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore the Gods to ſend us mild and juſt Emperors; but we muſt be obedient to thoſe the Gods have ſent us, whatever they be.</p>
            <p>The juſtice of this obligation never to withdraw from our Obedience to our Prince, is to acknowledge, even by the <hi>Hugonets</hi> themſelves, the moſt zealous in
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:61588:143"/>
their Religion, ſuch as was the deceas'd <hi>Monſieur Gombaut,</hi> who blames the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chellers</hi> for ſhutting their Gates againſt the deceas'd King, and conſtrain'd him to lay Siege to their City.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They ſhould have ſet open their Gates,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>to their Prince, and only have employ'd their weapons of Faith againſt his Force.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Theology</hi> of the Pagans agrees in this point with that of the Chriſtians, and places the violation of Loyalty to Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Princes, among the Crimes which are puniſh'd by the Gods in Hell.</p>
            <p>
               <q>God, ſays <hi>Plato,</hi> has in himſelf the Beginning, the Middle; and the End of Things, and Condemns by his juſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees all thoſe that refuſe to live humbly and peaceably in Obedience, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving themſelves capable to conduct themſelves, ſhake off their Obedience to their Soveraigns.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But God having eſtabliſh'd the Thrones of Kings for the benefit of the Publick, and to uphold Order among Men, has not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forbid their Subjects to Rebel againſt
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:61588:143"/>
em, but has alſo declar'd the Perſons of Soveraign Princes to be Sacred, and that it is utterly unlawful to make the leaſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt upon their Lives, how unjuſt, how violent and cruel ſoever they be. <q>Touch not, ſays the Scripture, thoſe that are Conſecrated to God by their being A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed, and conſequently ought to be rever'd as Holy.</q> And to the end we may not fail in our Duty to Kings, tells us he is ſo chary of their Honor, that he will not have it wounded ſo much as in Thought. <hi>"Curſe not the King, no not in thy Thought,</hi> ſays <hi>Eccleſiaſtes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We need not wonder then, if the Church inſtructed by the Holy Spirit, has ſuch a particular care of Kings, and that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by the great number of Decrees which ſhe has made in their favour, that ſhe employs all her Authority to preſerve both their Lives and their Reputation. The Fathers in a Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> thunder'd out their <hi>Anathema's</hi> againſt the execrable <hi>Theſis</hi> of <hi>John Petit,</hi> who ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects the Government of Kings to the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of their Subjects, and expoſes their Perſons to Sacrilegious Attempts. That Doctrine, which the ſame Divine, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:61588:144"/>
by the Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventur'd to maintain, and to colour the Aſſaſſination of the Duke of <hi>Orleance,</hi> the only Brother of <hi>Charles</hi> VI. was ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted by all the World, that maugre the Power of the Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> then Regent of the Kingdom, it was condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Univerſity of <hi>Paris,</hi> and the Writing it ſelf publickly burnt before the Church of <hi>Noſtre Dame.</hi> A certain Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil in <hi>Spain</hi> Excommunicated all thoſe that exclaim'd againſt the Government of Kings, and tore their Reputation with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famatory Libels. But it would be too long to recite what we meet with in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Writ, in Councils, and in the Writings of the Fathers upon this Subject.</p>
            <p>There is no queſtion therefore, but the Obedience which we owe to God and his Church, obliges us to a high veneration for Soveraign Princes, inviolably to preſerve our Loyalty, and Religiouſly to perform their Commands. In the mean while, where are thoſe Chriſtians that Honor God in the perſons of their Soveraigns, who are Loyal in diſcharge of their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and who obey their Commands with ſo much exactneſs, as if they had
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:61588:144"/>
receiv'd 'em from God himſelf. Do we not ſee that there is little or no Fidelity in thoſe that are ſo ſedulous in their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance upon Princes? only the deſire and hope of their Favours, redoubles their Zeal for the Service of their King when they receive Rewards? That it grows remiſs and weary when they find themſelves ſlighted; that it is utterly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh'd when they ſee no likelyhood of bettering their Fortune. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is, that in all the motions of the Court, there are ſo many People that throw themſelves into Parties, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to put themſelves into a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as to be able to wreſt by private Compact, and underhand Agreements, thoſe Gratifications and Employments which are refus'd 'em, and which they believe to be due to their Merit?</p>
            <p>What is this Loyalty in others, but the fear of thoſe Penalties and Puniſhments inflicted upon thoſe that violate their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance by Cabals and Factions prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to their Prince, and by Conſpiracies againſt their Perſons? Which is apparent from hence that ſome Princes that loath the ſeverity of ſpilling Human Blood, ſpare not
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:61588:145"/>
ſometimes the moſt conſiderable perſons in the Realm, to reſtrain others within the bounds of their Duty, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of their Juſtice.</p>
            <p>The Loyalty of Men of Judgment and Solidity, does it not proceed from their Knowledge, that there is nothing ſo great as the Power of Kings? and that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thought of their deſtruction is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Impious, but void of Senſe or Reaſon? They know that their very Guards which are a Body ſufficient, and ready upon all occaſions, will give no leiſure to Rebellion or Sedition to grow to a head. They know moreover, that Kings are the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſers of all thoſe Favours, thoſe Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, Dignities, and Employments, which Men ſo ardently ſeek after: So that they have always in their power, the infallible means to reduce thoſe that are revolted from their Obedience. Laſtly, they know that the greateſt part of thoſe Subjects who have forgot their Duty to their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigns, have brought themſelves to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Concluſions, have waxed old in Priſon, or ſpent the remainder of their days exil'd in Foreign Countreys with their Families.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="271" facs="tcp:61588:145"/>
Is it not alſo eaſie to be perceivd that the Loyalty of wealthy Perſons, who are contented with their Eſtates, and have no other Ambition, them to taſte the ſweets of Life, is meerly out of Intereſt. For in regard, that War is chiefly a ſcourge to them, which others deſire in hopes to gain Honour, or to enrich themſelves, they ſtand faſt to their Prince, as being the Perſon that continually watches over the Kingdom to prevent the calamities of Invaſion or Rebellion; and they look upon him as the Tutelar Angel of their Tranquility and Happineſs.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Deus nobis hac otia fecit.</l>
               <l>Such leiſure our Terreſtrial God</l>
               <l>On us beſtowed.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Can we have a better opinion of thoſe who being the Kings Domeſtick Servants, and advanc'd to the higheſt preferments in the Houſhold, can never prove diſloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al without looſing their Reputation, and ruining their Fortunes? and muſt we therefore believe their Loyalty to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted and truly virtuous?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="272" facs="tcp:61588:146"/>
What <hi>Idea</hi> can we form of the Loyalty of thoſe accompliſh'd Politicians, who at the firſt breaking out of a Civil War retire into the Countrey, there to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve which way the ſcales will turn, and to take the winning ſide? and ſo cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly behave themſelves as to be fear'd, and conſequently courted from the Court, leſt they ſhould joyn with the adverſe Party?</p>
            <p>In a word, the Loyalty of People is only a natural deſire to live at eaſe and quiet: but as there are many with whom it is all one whither they live in Peace or no, we may be ſure that all ſuch People are equally diſpos'd either to Obedience or Sedition; ſo that their Loyalty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends purely upon Seaſons and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions.</p>
            <p>Let us acknowledge then that the Loy alty of thoſe who have given, and every day give notable Proofs of their Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is built upon a ſlender and ſandy Foundation, as depending ſolely upon the diſpoſitions of the Heart of Man, who changes every time he changes his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, or that he harbors new Thoughts in his Mind. For how can we relye
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:61588:146"/>
upon a Perſon valiant and experienc'd in War, who in a civil Diſſention takes the Kings ſide, out of a perſwaſion that it is uſually the victorious Party, and that it will be doubtleſs moſt for his advantage? Is it impoſſible to convince him that he ſhall make a better Market by ſiding with the other Party; or to tempt him with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of being their Chieftain? And more then all this, may not Revenge, or ſome other Paſſion provoke him to forget his Duty? How many ſecret Springs and Wires are there in the Heart of Man to move it to and fro, at the direction of commanding Paſſions and Pleaſures?</p>
            <p>From whence we may conclude, that if we deſire to be Loyally Virtuous, and Virtuouſly Loyal, it behoves us to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to our Prince, by the ſame ties that we are bound to God: and that we ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour Soveraign Princes as his Vicege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and living Images, as the Miniſters of his Juſtice, and the Organs of his Will.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XXVII. <hi>Fidelity in keeping a Secret.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IT may ſeem that Men honour Fidelity as a <hi>Madam,</hi> becauſe we have need of it. As the one is neceſſary for the Body, the Soul cannot be without the other. The Heart of Man, ſays an <hi>Italian</hi> Poet, is a veſſel too ſmall to contain all that fills it from without, and grows with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it ſelf: ſo that of neceſſity it muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large it ſelf; and happy are they that can find faithful friends, that are able to receive what their Hearts cannot contain, and to lodge it carefully.</p>
            <p>But to ſay truth, it is not the ſmallneſs of Mans Heart that ſets ſo high a value up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Fidelity. Thus 'tis the condition of Man, whom Nature has produc'd ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, that he is not ſufficient for himſelf. And therefore ſhe allows him ſo great an
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:61588:147"/>
inclination to Society. Man is therefore ſo prone to communicate and impart to others, that he would not be ſatisfy'd with his own Merit, if he did not hope to make it known in the World. This Hope it is that gives life to all his Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſets all his Inclinations at work. This is that which makes him toil after the Acquiſition of Sciences; for he would nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther take any care to be Learned, nor any pleaſure in being ſo, if he did not hope to make it appear.</p>
            <p>Man therefore being thus preſſed by his violent Inclinations, to communicate to others his Thoughts, his Opinions, his Knowledge, his Deſigns, finds that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not gratify his Inclinations, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing himſelf to the viſible dangers that threaten his Honour, his Repoſe, his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts; that the Infidelity of Man is ſo great, and ſo general, that he cannot impart his ſecret deſigns, without raiſing obſtacles at the ſame time, that may impede their accompliſhment; nor without encountring Accidents, that ſometimes injure the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of conſiderable Perſons, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome blemiſh to his own.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="276" facs="tcp:61588:148"/>
Therefore it is that he ſeeks out for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons Diſcreet, Secret, and Faithful. On the other ſide, They who are conſcious of their Fidelity, well knowing how requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite and neceſſary it is, put as high a value upon it as they can, to render it uſeful and profitable to their Reputation and Fortune. For which reaſons they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally apply themſelves to perſons of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, or of high Quality, and lay hold up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all opportunities to ſcrew themſelves in their confidence. That of Princes they eaſily obtain, becauſe their idle hours and leiſure require continual converſation; and beſides that their Minds are ſenſible and impatient, and their Thoughts more live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and impetuous than thoſe of other Men. So that through their impatience to ſatisfy 'em, 'tis a wonderful eaſe to their Minds that they are able to communicate, and tell what they know to perſons that never betray their Truſt. For this reaſon they love thoſe that have the reputation of Secreſie, and favour 'em upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, and highly honour 'em; becauſe they find that perſons of Secreſie careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſerve their Truſt depoſited in their
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:61588:148"/>
Breaſts; and not out of any real eſteem that they have of their Fidelity.</p>
            <p>And indeed this diſeſteem of Fidelity might be excuſable, if they knew the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives that obliged them to be faithful, whoſe Fidelity they have ſo frequently experienced: nor would they have ſuch a value as they have for their Confidents, did they but conſider that there is nothing ſo dear as to meet with Confidents that keep a ſecret to the utmoſt of exactneſs, without imparting it to any Soul what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever living. And they would extremely diſtruſt ſome of thoſe Secret-keepers, were they but well inform'd, that there are ſome perſons that make a Trade of keeping Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, like Merchants that trafick for Pearls, which is a certain Truth, but ſuch a one as requires ſomething of Illuſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to make it evident.</p>
            <p>All the world admires the prodigious vanity of Merchants in great Cities; and they cannot but wonder that the deſire of Gain, has intermixed in Commerce <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="278" facs="tcp:61588:149"/>
Merchants; that they expoſe every thing to ſale; ſome their valour and milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Experience, to be accounted while they live, the Props of the Kingdom, and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalize themſelves after death: others their Arts and Sciences, to make themſelves famous; others their Wit, to render them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves acceptable in all companies: others their dexterity in buſineſs, to gain credit at Court, and make a Figure. But what profit can they make of themſelves that have no good quality, neither<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Art nor Science, neither Wit nor Dexterity in bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs?</p>
            <p>Theſe people gain by their double dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence near ſome great Perſon, who at length heaves 'em into ſome good employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. By their acceſs to ſome Lady courted by all the World for the greatneſs of her Wit, whoſe approbation is to them inſtead of Merit. By the confidence which the Prince repoſes in 'em; for having their Secrets at their diſpoſal, he employs 'em to ſatisfy the Curioſity of ſome idle Lady, to awaken her Sences, and revive her out of that Languiſhment into which her ſloth has caſt her. Or elſe they oblige ſome Perſon conſiderable at Court, whoſe Ears
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:61588:149"/>
itch after the rarity of News. Well—but are not theſe People ſoon diſcovered? No—For they never tell any Secret of importance committed to their charge, but to fuch as they are ſure will never fail 'em, for fear of looſing the ſatisfaction of their Curioſity. In a word they are no Sives that can hold nothing that is told 'em: nor no Fools, that what they hear they tell to all people without diſtinctions, but ſuch as are judiciouſly unfaithful, and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent diſpenſers of a Secret.</p>
            <p>But if there be any ſuch as can keep a Secret ſo religiouſly, as to ſcruple the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of it to their moſt intimate friends, they never take this courſe but upon good grounds that regard their Intereſts. Of which the firſt is, that Fidelity is an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt way to accompliſh their ends: for thô all Men are govern'd by their Intereſts, yet the Intereſt of all Men are not the ſame. For in ſome the deſire of Wealth predominates, in others the deſire of being eſteem'd and valu'd, is more prevalent than that of getting Riches. Hence it comes to paſs, that the latter ſcorn to profit by Proſtitutions, and mean Tricks, and that they only make uſe of
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:61588:150"/>
honeſt ways to advantage themſelves.</p>
            <p>The Second Reaſon is, becauſe it is a pleaſant way. There being nothing ſo delightful to a vain perſon, as to be the Confident of a Prince; and to be frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with him in his Cloſet, while the Door is ſhut to all others.</p>
            <p>The Third Reaſon is, becauſe it is a ſafe way. For it is impoſſible but that the Perſons entruſting muſt ſtudy the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe into whoſe Boſoms they diſcharge the pleaſures or Afflictions of their Minds; and with whom they have depoſited their Lives, their Honour, and their Liberty.</p>
            <p>The laſt reaſon is, their fear of being diſeſteemed, and to be depriv'd of the advantages of ſuch Honourable Society. For they who reveal the Secrets commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to their keeping, are deſpiſed by all the World, and excluded out of all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies.</p>
            <p>Theſe Human Conſiderations render us ſecret and faithful, not the eſteem or love of Fidelity: much leſs, out of any Obedience to the Commands of God, to do as we would be done by. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Fidelity of the wiſe Men of the
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:61588:150"/>
Age is not out of any real Vertue; for that exact Fidelity is a rare thing; which made the Pagans complain, That there was no Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity among Men.</p>
            <p>Therefore only Chriſtianity is to be lookt upon as a Renovation of the firſt Age of the World, where true Fidelity and Loyalty are re-eſtabliſh'd. Which Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues ſhin'd ſo brightly in the Manners of the Primitive Chriſtians, that in the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traiture which <hi>Plinie</hi> the Second gives of 'em to <hi>Trajan</hi> the Emperor, he marks out their Fidelity for a Quality that render'd 'em highly valuable.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Their Life, ſays he, is very innocent, they keep their words inviolably, and faithfully reſtore whatever is committed to their charge.</q>

            <head>CHAP. XXVIII. <hi>Acknowledgment, or Gratitude.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>MEN admire thoſe excellent Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians that underſtand ſo well to vary the tone of their Voice, their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, and their Actions, that they ſeem to be two different Perſons at one and the ſame time. But they would much more admire, were they but aware, how In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt alone acts that infinite number of Perſons which we ſee upon the Theatre of the World. 'Tis Intereſt that acts the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Judge, and the Magiſtrate full of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity; the Modeſt, the Magnificent, the Covetous and the Liberal; which ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelf under the ſhape of a Perſon that demands Counſel, appears at the ſame time in the likeneſs of a kind Friend that gives his advice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="283" facs="tcp:61588:151"/>
If any Man queſtion the truth of this, let him but nearly conſider a Benefactor, and a Grateful Perſon. For thô the Firſt may ſeemingly ſtudy to beſtow his Gifts without any deſign but meerly to grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy his Beneficent Inclination; and that the other deſires nothing more then to teſtify his Gratitude for the Favours he has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd; and yet neither Generoſity or Gratitude can be aſcrib'd either to the one or the other, while both drive directly to their own Intereſts.</p>
            <p>To be convinc'd of the truth of this, we muſt firſt conſider the carriage and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of a Benefactor, who as ſoon as he has any employment or preferment to beſtow, he not only ſtudies who to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify, but he is no leſs careful that the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent which he makes him, may not want any of thoſe Circumſtances which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to enhance the Price, and render it acceptable. To which end he caſts his Eye upon ſome Perſon that never expects it, that never did him any ſervice, nor ever ſpoke to him in his life.</p>
            <p>Certain it is that this way of proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if we examine and look upon it, as to the intention of the Benefactor, is ſo far
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:61588:152"/>
from being frank and generous, that it is only a piece of fine ſpun Intereſt; That the Benefactor ſtudy'd not to looſe his kindneſs, when he beſtowed it with ſuch a comly Grace, and that all his cares to render his proceedings fair and gentile, are the ties wherewith he deſires to bind the Party engag'd. And therefore we have reaſon to wonder at the ſaying of <hi>Seneca;</hi> We look round about the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of thoſe to whom we lend our Money, or upon whom we beſtow our kindneſſes to ſee whither they have enough to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer us; for covetous Men are not more cautious of their Security when they lend Money, than others are when they beſtow a Kindneſs; for that we never fix upon the Perſon, till we have a long time reckon'd up what ſervice he may be able to do us, or till we find he may be uſeful to us in our buſineſs, or fit to accompliſh our private deſigns. Upon thoſe Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations we prefer one Man before ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and it is to engage him in ſuch a manner that he may not fail us, that we are ſo careful, that the moſt endearing cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances we can think of, may accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany our kindneſſes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="285" facs="tcp:61588:152"/>
For proof of this, let us but conſider the Surprizes, the Indignation, the deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of a Perſon that has met with an ungrateful return of his Favours, his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Anxieties and publick Complaints againſt Ingratitude; in what diſmal co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours does henot ſet it forth? How he tears up his Reputation, and exclaims againſt him as a Perſon that had robbed him; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, had he ſought to pleaſe himſelf in the Kindneſs, he had had his pleaſure: or if he aim'd at no advantage to himſelf, why is he ſo enrag'd at his loſs? We muſt confeſs that his deſpair proceeds from this, that he finds all his hopes deluded; and for that he has not reaped the fruits of the t'others Promiſes. But there is no Man ſo ſimple to believe he hates Ingratitude for its ſelf, or that he is ſo taken with the lovelineſs of the Virtue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he cannot endure the deformity of the Vice.</p>
            <p>From whence we may eaſily conclude two things; Firſt, that we are very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful and hypocritical, to make the World believe we carry noble Souls, and aim at no gratification for the Favours which we beſtow; but that we are fully ſatisfied, in finding our ſelves capable to
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:61588:153"/>
do good to others. The Second is, that there would be no ingrateful perſons, if this Maxim of <hi>Seneca</hi> were true, That Men are not oblig'd to acknowledge any other then the Favours done us freely, and without hope of recompence.</p>
            <p>Now let us ſee what are the ſentiments of a Grateful Perſon, and what is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Principle of his Gratitude. The Firſt Sentiments then that ariſe in the heart of a Grateful Perſon, are ſo tender, ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate, and ſeem ſo naturally conceiv'd for his Benefactor, that an ungrateful per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon frequently deceives himſelf, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves he has for his Benefactor a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, not only ſincere but cordial. But whatever he thinks, proceeds from his own Self-Love, and cauſes him to be thankful for the kindneſſes he receives to thoſe that are the Donors, not for love of them, but meerly upon the conſideration of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. But the next ſucceeding Thoughts to theſe are quite contrary; For he that has receiv'd great kindneſſes, preſently perceives, that they are no Preſents but only Loans; he begins to look upon his Benefactor as his Creditor that Dunns him, and all the obligations which he
<pb n="872" facs="tcp:61588:153"/>
owes, as ſo many Chains and Fetters that load and oppreſs him. Which Condition is to him ſo inſupportable, that his deſire to free himſelf inclines him ſecretly to laugh at all his Obligations; and his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude would doubly appear upon the firſt occaſion, did he not fear the ruine of his new pretenſions.</p>
            <p>This Fear, or rather Hope of ſome more conſiderable benefit, it it which inſpires him with ſentiments of Gratitude, which obliges him to publiſh the Generoſity of his Benefactor, diligently to viſit him; and to ſhew him upon all occaſions, how highly, and how particularly he is behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him. Nevertheleſs, if any other Perſon, in the heighth of all this double diligence, ſhews him but the leaſt glimmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſome greater Preferment; he turns about immediately, and goes directly where his Intereſt calls him. However, he ſtill carries himſelf outwardly very fair toward his Benefactors, till the fatal occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion gives him an opportunity to pick a Quarrel, and then without any heſitation away he dings to court his greater profit. Then his Intereſt declares it ſelf, and his Ingratitude ſallys out from the bottom of
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:61588:154"/>
his Heart, and ſhews it ſelf no leſs black then it is, notwithſtanding all the care he takes to vail it with a million of preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and to leſſen the benefits he has recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
            <p>Nor need we be ſurprized, that a Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſo treacherous and baſe ſhould breed in the Heart of Man: For more wondrous Sentiments breed there, if we may believe <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> The Nature of Man is ſo wicked, that they who owe great ſumms, and they who have receiv'd conſiderable Favors, wiſh with an equal hatred, the one the death of their Creditors, the other of their Benefactors.</p>
            <p>Which ſaying of the Philoſopher con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the malice of Men to their Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors, will not ſeem incredible to thoſe that underſtand the vaſtneſs of his Pride, and that all dependencies and duties are odious to him, but rather make it evident how far the Thoughts of Men are from ſincere and virtuous Gratitude; and that when they do behave themſelves grateful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it is only in hopes of ſome newer Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="289" facs="tcp:61588:154"/>
               <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is ſo far convinc'd of this, as to aſſure us, that they on whom we beſtow our Favours, have no affection for their Benefactors, only they admire the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes which they receive or hope to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. Which is the reaſon we do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the intention of <hi>Seneca,</hi> who takes upon him in ſeveral Treatiſes, to inſtruct how to beſtow our kindneſſes; ſuppoſing the ill choice of Subjects, to be the only cauſe why there is ſo little Gratitude ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, when as it proceeds from the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of Mans Heart, which is ſo ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and unjuſt, that unleſs we could make Men in love with Juſtice, it is impoſſible to make'em Grateful. <q>If thou doſt not inſpire Vertue withal, ſays <hi>Plato,</hi> into thoſe whom thou obligeſt, they will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be ſenſible of thy kindneſſes.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But Intereſt is not the only cauſe of Gratitude; there is alſo in the firſt place, the fear of that ſhame which attends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Ingratitude. For ſince Men are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Soveraign Judges of Human Actions, they have adjudged far more Infamous thoſe that offend or injure them, then they that violate the Laws of God; and becauſe no Men are more hated,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:61588:155"/>
then they who do not equal with their Services the Obligations they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, but fruſtrate the expectations of their Benefactors: Hence it comes to paſs, that they are look'd upon by the Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, as Men unworthy to live, and that Ingratitude is branded, when Sacriledge and Impiety are honour'd.</p>
            <p>Theſe two ſorts of Gratitude, the one proceeding from Intereſt, the other from Fear, are the moſt uſual. Thoſe ſorts of Gratitude that proceed from Pride and Vanity, are not ſo effectual, but they are common enough. We find this ſort of acknowledgment in thoſe, who having been the Favourites of Kings and Princes, take all occaſions to mention the benefits which they have received at their hands, and enlarge upon the circumſtances, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly to ſhew that they preſerve 'em ſtill in their Memory; but indeed to let the world ſee that they were no mean Perſons in thoſe days.</p>
            <p>There are ſome ſorts of acknowledgment that proceed from malignity, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring Diſcontent. Such are thoſe which ſome affect to ſhew before certain Perſons whom they deſign cunningly to accuſe
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:61588:155"/>
for neglect of their Services: who expreſs themſelves after this manner. <hi>I have been hugely beholding to ſuch a Prince, he has done me a thouſand kindn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſſes; but I took nothing ſo kindly, as that he ſtill prevented my Requeſts.</hi> Theſe Kindneſſes thus ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd before great Perſons, from whom they deſign to wreſt particular Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, are uſually cunning Accuſations and Reproaches thrown upon 'em for their remiſsneſs, and private intimations of what they expect at their hands.</p>
            <p>There are other Acknowledgments, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and Criminal; Such are the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments of thoſe who having a falſe <hi>Idaea</hi> of Friendſhip, believe that gives 'em a priviledge, and impoſes an Obligation upon 'em to violate Laws, the moſt juſt and equitable, to eſpouſe the unjuſt Quarrels of their Friends, to ſerve 'em in Duels and Revenges, and to aſſiſt 'em in the ſtealing of Fortunes, and to concern themſelves in Intrigues and Confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies contrary to their Duty.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, there are cunning and politic Acknowledgments which we teſtify to thoſe that ſollicite our Aſſairs, to oblige 'em to Fidelity and Diligence. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:61588:156"/>
There was a Perſon at Court, who having oblig'd a Friend to ſerve him in a buſineſs of importance, that tended to the advancement of his Family, gave him full aſſurances of his acknowledgments, propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to the difficulties that preſented themſelve, ſo that when he ſaw him tir'd out with the pains that he had taken, and diſcours'd with the apprehenſion of new obſtacles: <q>Sir, ſaid the other, I am ſenſible of the trouble which I gave ye, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how much you oblige me; and were not I a perſon of an abſolute good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet had I but a grain of Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, it would ſuffice to make me eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally ſenſible of the Obligations you have laid upon me.</q> And this he repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as often as he found the zeal of his Friend begin to grow cold. It is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to recite the reſt of this Story; it will ſuffice to tell ye, that the Perſon of Quality's buſineſs being accompliſh'd, he ſoon cancell'd the Remembrance of the ſignal Service done him: ſo that indeed the more we ſtudy Men, the leſs we are able to apprehend, how they can live at peace with themſelves. All that comes into his Mind is this, that while others ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:61588:156"/>
Vices in his Vertues, he perhaps may ſee Vertues in his Vices; and in his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, look upon that for a great piece of Dexterity, which we rebuke for double-dealing and Impoſture: Or elſe he may act like the Peacock, who always looks upon what he has moſt lovely.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Spiegala Pompa del'e occhiute Piume</l>
               <l>Diſplays the Pomp of his Embroiaer'd Tail.</l>
            </q>
            <p>But never minds his acts of Injuſtice, Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, and Ingratitude.</p>
            <p>There are two ſorts of Ingrateful Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as there are two ſorts of Knaves. The Firſt are ungrateful to the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and turn their Tails as ſoon as they have receiv'd a Kindneſs, fearleſs of the Diſgrace or Infamy that attends it.
