            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>1 Cor. III. 15.</bibl>
               <q>But he himself shall be saved, yet so as
by fire.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <hi>THE Context is thus.</hi> According to the grace
of God which is given unto me, as a wise
Master-builder, I have laid the foundation
and another buildeth thereon: but let every man take
heed how he buildeth thereupon. For other foundation
can no man lay, than that which is laid, Jesus Christ.
Now if any man build upon this foundation, gold, silver,
precious stones, wood, hay, stubble, every mans work shall
be made manifest, for the day shall declare it; because
it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every
mans work of what sort it is. If any mans work abide
which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.
If any mans work shall be burnt, he shall suffer
loss; but he himself shall be saved, yet so as by fire.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:47159:3"/>
In these words the Apostle speaks of a sort of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
who held indeed the foundation of <hi>Christianity,</hi>
but built upon it such <hi>doctrines</hi> or <hi>practices</hi> as would
not bear the <hi>trial;</hi> which he expresses to us by <hi>wood,
hay,</hi> and <hi>stubble,</hi> which are not <hi>proof</hi> against the <hi>fire.</hi>
Such a person, the Apostle tells us, hath brought
himself into a very dangerous state, though he would
not deny the possibility of his salvation: <hi>He himself
shall be saved, yet so as by fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That by <hi>fire</hi> here is not meant the fire of <hi>Purgatory,</hi>
as some pretend (who would be glad of any shadow
of a text of Scripture to countenance their own
dreams) I shall neither trouble you nor my self to
manifest; since the <hi>particle</hi> of similitude [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] plainly
shews that the Apostle did not intend an escape out
of the fire <hi>literally,</hi> but like to that which men make
out of a House or Town that is on fire. Especially
since very learned persons of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> do
acknowledge that <hi>Purgatory</hi> cannot be concluded
from this <hi>Text,</hi> nay all that <hi>Estius</hi> contends for from
this <hi>place</hi> is, that it cannot be concluded from hence
that there is no <hi>Purgatory;</hi> which we never pretended,
but only that this Text does not prove it.</p>
            <p>It is very well known that this is a Proverbial
phrase used not only in Scripture, but in prophane Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
to signifie <hi>a narrow escape out of a great danger.</hi>
He shall be saved, yet so as by fire, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>out of
the fire.</hi> Just as <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is used, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 20. where
the Apostle speaking of the eight persons of <hi>Noah's</hi>
family who escap'd the flood, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
they escaped <hi>out of the water.</hi> So here this phrase is
to be rendred in the Text, <hi>he himself shall escape, yet
so as out of the fire.</hi> The like expression you have,
<hi>Am 4. 11. I have pluckt them as a firebrand out of
the fire.</hi> And <hi>Jude 23. Others save with fear,
plucking them out of the fire.</hi> All which expressions
signifie the greatness of the danger and the difficulty
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:47159:3"/>
of escaping it; <hi>as one who when his house at midnight
is set on fire, and being suddenly wak'd leaps out of his
bed, and runs naked out of the doors, taking nothing
that is within along with him, but imploying his
whole care to save his body from the flames, as</hi> St.
<hi>Chrysostom</hi> upon another occasion ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth
it. And so the <hi>Roman</hi> Orator<note n="*" place="margin">Tully.</note>
(who, it is likely did not think of <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory)</hi>
useth this Phrase; <hi>Quo ex judicio, velut ex
incendio, nudus effugit;</hi> From which Judgment or
Sentence he escaped naked, as it were out of a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
And one of the <hi>Greek</hi> Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
<note n="*" place="margin">Aristides.</note> tells us, That <hi>to save a man out
of the fire, was a common proverbial
speech.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the words thus explained, the Observation
that naturally ariseth is this, <hi>That men may hold all
the Fundamentals of Christian Religion, and yet may
superadd other things whereby they may greatly endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
their salvation.</hi> What those things were which
some among the <hi>Corinthians</hi> built upon the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Christianity, whereby they endanger'd their
Salvation, we may probably conjecture by what the
Apostle reproves in this Epistle, as the tolerating of
<hi>incestuous marriages,</hi> communicating in <hi>Idol-feasts,</hi> &amp;c.
And especially by the doctrine of the false Apostles,
who at that time did so much disturb the peace of
most Christian Churches, and who are so often and
so severely reflected upon in this Epistle. And what
their <hi>Doctrine</hi> was, we have an account, <hi>Act. 15. viz.</hi>
that they imposed upon the <hi>Gentile</hi> Christians <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision,
and the observation of the Jewish Law,</hi>
teaching that <hi>unless they were circumcised, and kept the
Law of Moses, they could not be saved.</hi> So that they
did not only build these doctrines upon <hi>Christianity,</hi>
but they made them equal with the <hi>Foundation,</hi> say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that <hi>unless men believed and practised such things
they could not be saved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:47159:4"/>
In speaking to this <hi>Observation,</hi> I shall reduce my
discourse to these two Heads.</p>
            <p>1. I shall present to you some <hi>Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices</hi>
which have been built upon the <hi>Foundation of
Christianity,</hi> to the great hazard and danger of mens
<hi>salvation.</hi> And to be plain, I mean particularly the
Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. I shall enquire, whether our granting a <hi>possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
of salvation (though with great hazard) to those
in the Communion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
it to us, be a reasonable argument and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
to any man to betake himself to that
Church.</p>
            <p>And there is the more reason to consider these
things, when so many <hi>seducing Spirits</hi> are so active
and busie to pervert men from the <hi>truth;</hi> and when
we see every day so many men and their <hi>Religion</hi> so
easily parted. For this reason these two Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
shall be the subject of the following discourse.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>First.</hi> We will consider some <hi>Doctrines</hi> and
<hi>Practices</hi> which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath built upon
the <hi>foundation</hi> of <hi>Christianity,</hi> to the great hazard
and danger of mens <hi>salvation.</hi> It is not denied by the
most judicious <hi>Protestants,</hi> but that the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> do hold all the Articles of the Christian Faith,
which are necessary to salvation. But that which we
charge upon them, as a just ground of our separation
from them, is, <hi>the imposing of new Doctrines and
Practices upon Christians as necessary to salvation,</hi>
which were never taught by our Saviour, or his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles;
and which are either directly contrary to the
doctrine of Christianity, or too apparently destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of a good life. And I begin</p>
            <p>1. With their <hi>Doctrines.</hi> And because I have no
mind to aggravate lesser matters, I will single out
four or five points of Doctrine, which they have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to the Christian Religion, and which were neither
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:47159:4"/>
taught by our Saviour and his Apostles, nor own'd
in the first Ages of Christianity. And the</p>
            <p>First which I shall mention, and which being once
admitted makes way for as many errors as they please
to bring in, is their <hi>Doctrine of Infallibility.</hi> And
this they are very stiff and peremptory in, though
they are not agreed among themselves where this
<hi>Infallibility</hi> is seated; whether in the <hi>Pope alone,</hi> or
a <hi>Council alone,</hi> or in <hi>both together,</hi> or in the <hi>diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
body of Christians.</hi> But they are sure they have
it, though they know not where it is.</p>
            <p>And is this no prejudice against it? can any man
think that this <hi>privilege</hi> was at first conferred upon the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that Christians in all Ages did
believe it, and had constant recourse to it for determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
their differences, and yet that that very Church
which hath enjoyed and used it so long should now
be at a loss where to find it? Nothing could have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
out more unluckily, than that there should be
such differences among them about that which they
pretend to be the onely means of ending all differences.</p>
            <p>There is not the least intimation in Scripture of
this <hi>privilege</hi> conferr'd upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, nor
do the Apostles, in all their Epistles, ever so much as
give the least direction to Christians to appeal to the
Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> for a determination of the many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
which even in those times happen'd among
them: And it is strange they should be so silent in this
matter, when there were so many <hi>occasions</hi> to speak
of it, if our Saviour had plainly appointed such an
<hi>infallible Judge</hi> of controversies for this very end to
decide the differences that should happen among
Christians. It is strange that the <hi>ancient Fathers</hi> in
their disputes with Hereticks should never appeal to
this <hi>Judge;</hi> nay, it is strange they should not constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
do it in all cases, it being so short and expedite a
way for the ending of controversies. And this very
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47159:5"/>
consideration to a wise man is instead of a thousand
arguments to satisfie him, that in those times no such
thing was believed in the world.</p>
            <p>Now this <hi>Doctrine of Infallibility,</hi> if it be not true,
is of so much the more pernicious consequence to
Christianity, because the conceit of it does confirm
them that think they have it in all their other errors;
and gives them a pretence of assuming an Authority
to themselves to impose their own fancies and mistakes
upon the whole Christian world.</p>
            <p>2. Their <hi>Doctrine</hi> about <hi>Repentance,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
in confessing their sins to the Priest; which if it
be but accompanied with any degree of <hi>contrition</hi>
does upon <hi>absolution</hi> received from the Priest, put
them into a state of <hi>salvation,</hi> though they have lived
the most lewd and debauched lives that can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd;
than which nothing can be more plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
of a good life. For if this be true, all the
hazard that the most wicked man runs of his salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is only the danger of so <hi>sudden a death</hi> as gives him
no space for confession and absolution. A case that
happens so rarely, that any man that is strongly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
to his lusts will be content to venture his salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
upon this hazard; and all the arguments to a
good life will be very insignificant to a man that
hath a mind to be wicked, when remission of sins may
be had upon such cheap terms.</p>
            <p>3. The <hi>Doctrine of Purgatory;</hi> By which they mean
an estate of temporary punishments after this life,
from which men may be released and translated into
Heaven by the prayers of the living, and the sacrifice
of the <hi>Mass.</hi> That this Doctrine was not known in
the primitive Church, nor can be proved from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
we have the free acknowledgment of as learned
and eminent men as any of that Church; which is to
acknowledge that it is a superstructure upon the
Christian Religion. And though in one sense it be
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:47159:5"/>
indeed a building of <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver</hi> upon the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of Christianity, considering the vast revenues
which this Doctrine (and that of Indulgences, which
depends upon it) brings into that Church; yet I doubt
not, but in the Apostle's sense, it will be found to be
<hi>hay</hi> and <hi>stubble.</hi> But how groundless soever it be, it is
too gainfull a Doctrine to be easily parted withall.</p>
            <p>4. The <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Transubstantiation.</hi> A hard
<hi>word,</hi> but I would to God that were the worst of it;
the <hi>thing</hi> is much more difficult. I have taken some
pains to consider other Religions that have been in the
world, and I must freely declare, that I never yet in
any of them met with any Article or Proposition, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
upon the belief of men, half so unreasonable and
hard to be believed as this is: And yet this in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish</hi>
Church is esteemed one of the most principal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of the Christian Faith; though there is no more
certain foundation for it in Scripture, than for our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's
being substantially changed into all those things
which are said of him, as that he is a <hi>rock,</hi> a <hi>vine,</hi> a
<hi>door,</hi> and a hundred other things.</p>
            <p>But this is not all. This Doctrine hath not only <hi>no
certain Foundation</hi> in Scripture, but I have a far heavier
charge against it, namely, that it undermines the very
foundation of Christianity it self. And surely nothing
ought to be admitted to be a part of the <hi>Christian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi>
which destroys the reason of our belief of the
whole. And that this Doctrine does so, will appear e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently,
if we consider what was the main argument
which the Apostles used to convince the world of the
<hi>truth of Christianity;</hi> and that was this, <hi>That our
blessed Saviour, the Author of this Doctrine, wrought
such and such miracles, and particularly that he rose
again from the dead:</hi> And this they proved because
they were eye-witnesses of his miracles, and had seen
him and conversed with him after he was risen from
the dead. But what if their senses did deceive them
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47159:6"/>
in this matter? then it cannot be denied but that the
main proof of Christianity falls to the ground.</p>
            <p>Well! We will now suppose (as the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> does) <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> to have been one prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
part of the Christian Doctrine which the Apostles
preached. But if this Doctrine be true, then all mens
senses are deceived in a plain sensible matter, wherein
'tis as hard for them to be deceived as in any thing in
the world: For two things can hardly be imagin'd
more different, than a <hi>little bit</hi> of wafer, and the
<hi>whole body</hi> of a man.</p>
            <p>So that the Apostles perswading men to believe this
Doctrine, perswaded them not to trust their senses,
and yet the argument which they used to perswade
them to this was built upon the direct contrary prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
that mens <hi>senses are to be trusted.</hi> For if they
be not, then notwithstanding all the evidence the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
offer'd for the resurrection of our Saviour he
might not be risen, and so the faith of Christians was
vain. So that they represent the Apostles as absurd as
is possible, <hi>viz.</hi> going about to perswade men out of
their senses by virtue of an argument, the whole
strength whereof depends upon the certainty of sense.</p>
            <p>And now the matter is brought to a fair issue; If
the testimony of sense be to be relied upon, then <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation</hi>
is false; If it be not, then no man is
sure that Christianity is true. For the utmost assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
that the Apostles had of the truth of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
was the testimony of their own senses concerning
our Saviour's miracles, and this testimony every man
hath against <hi>Transubstantiation.</hi> From whence it
plainly follows, that no man (no not the Apostles
themselves) had more reason to believe <hi>Christianity</hi>
to be true, than every man hath to believe <hi>Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation</hi>
to be false. And we who did not see our
Saviour's Miracles (as the Apostles did) and have only
a credible relation of them, but do see the <hi>Sacrament;</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:47159:6"/>
have less evidence of the <hi>truth of Christianity</hi> than of
the <hi>falshood</hi> of <hi>Transubstantiation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But cannot God impose upon the senses of men,
and represent things to them otherwise than they are?
Yes, undoubtedly. And if he hath revealed that he
doth this, are we not to believe him? Most certainly.
But then we ought to be assured that he hath made
such a Revelation; which <hi>Assurance</hi> no man can
have, the certainty of sense being taken away.</p>
            <p>I shall press the business a little farther. Supposing
the <hi>Scripture</hi> to be a <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> and that these
words <hi>(This is my Body)</hi> if they be in Scripture, must
necessarily be taken in the strict and literal sense; I
ask now, What greater evidence any man has that
these words <hi>(This is my Body)</hi> are in the Bible, than
every man has that the Bread is not chang'd in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament?
Nay no man has so much; for we have
only the evidence of <hi>one</hi> sense that these words are in
the Bible, but that the Bread is not chang'd we have
the concurring testimony of <hi>several</hi> of our senses. In
a word, if this be once admitted that the <hi>Senses</hi> of all
men are deceiv'd in one of the most plain sensible mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
that can be, there is no certain means left either
to convey or prove a <hi>Divine Revelation</hi> to men; nor
is there any way to confute the grossest impostures in
the World: For if the clear evidence of all mens sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
be not sufficient for this purpose, let any man, if
he can, find a better and more convincing argument.</p>
            <p>5. I will instance but in one <hi>Doctrine</hi> more; And
that shall be, their <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>deposing Kings</hi> in case
of Heresie, and absolving their Subjects from their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance
to them. And this is not a meer <hi>speculative
Doctrine,</hi> but hath been put in practice many a time
by the Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> as every one knows that is
vers'd in History. For the troubles and confusions
which were occasion'd by this very thing make up a
good part of the History of several Ages.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:47159:7"/>
I hope no body expects that I should take the pains
to shew that this was not the Doctrine of our Saviour
and his Apostles, nor of the Primitive Christians. The
<hi>Papists</hi> are many of them so far from pretending this,
that in some times and places, when it is not seasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and for their purpose, we have much a-do to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
them that ever it was their Doctrine. But if
<hi>Transubstantiation</hi> be their Doctrine, <hi>this</hi> is; for they
came both out of the same Forge, I mean the Council
of <hi>Lateran</hi> under Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third. And if
(as they tell us) <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> was then establish'd,
so was <hi>this.</hi> And indeed one would think they were
Twins and brought forth at the same time, they are
so like one another, both of them so monstrously un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable.</p>
            <p>II. I come now in the <hi>second</hi> place to consider some
<hi>Practices</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which I am afraid
will prove as bad as her <hi>Doctrines.</hi> I shall instance
in these five.</p>
            <p>1. Their celebrating of their Divine service in an
<hi>unknown Tongue.</hi> And that not only contrary to the
practice of the Primitive Church, and to the great
end and design of Religious Worship, which is the
Edification of those who are concerned in it, (and it is
hard to imagine how men can be edified by what they
do not understand) but like wise in direct Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who hath no less than a whole Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
wherein he confutes this Practice as fully, and
condemns it as plainly as any thing is condemned in
the whole Bible. And they that can have the face to
maintain that this Practice was not condemned by
St. <hi>Paul,</hi> or that it was allowed and used in the first
Ages of Christianity, need not be ashamed to set up
for the defence of any Paradox in the World.</p>
            <p>2. The Communion <hi>in one kind.</hi> And that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
that even by their own acknowledgment
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:47159:7"/>
our Saviour instituted it in both kinds, and the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Church administred it in both kinds. This I
must acknowledge is no <hi>addition</hi> to Christianity, but
a <hi>sacrilegious taking away</hi> of an essential part of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.
For the <hi>Cup</hi> is as essential a part of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
as the <hi>Bread;</hi> and they might as well, and
by the same Authority, take away the one as the other,
and both as well as either.</p>
            <p>3. Their worshipping of <hi>Images.</hi> Which practice
(notwithstanding all their Distinctions about it, which
are no other but what the <hi>Heathens</hi> used in the same
case) is as point-blank against the <hi>second Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
as a <hi>deliberate</hi> and <hi>malicious killing</hi> of a man is
against the <hi>sixth.</hi> But if the case be so plain, a man
would think that at least the Teachers and Guides of
that Church should be sensible of it. Why, they are
so, and afraid the people should be so too, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in their ordinary <hi>Catechisms</hi> and <hi>Manuals</hi> of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
they leave out the <hi>second Commandment,</hi> and
divide the <hi>tenth</hi> into two to make up the number;
lest if the common people should know it their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
should start at the doing of a thing so directly
contrary to the plain command of God.</p>
            <p>4. The worshipping of the <hi>bread</hi> and <hi>wine</hi> in the
Eucharist, out of a false and groundless perswasion,
<hi>that they are substantially changed into the body and
blood of Christ.</hi> Which if it be not true (and it hath good
fortune if it be, for certainly it is one of the most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
things in the whole World) then by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of several of their own learned Writers, they
are guilty of <hi>gross Idolatry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. The worship and invocation of <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels;</hi>
and particularly of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> which hath
now for some Ages been a principal part of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
Now a man may justly wonder that so consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
a part of Religion as they make this to be
should have no manner of foundation in the Scripture.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:47159:8"/>
Does our Saviour any where speak one word concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the worshipping of Her? Nay, does he not take
all occasions to restrain all extravagant apprehensions
and imaginations concerning honour due to Her, as
foreseeing the degeneracy of the Church in this thing?
When he was told that his Mother and Brethren were
without; <hi>Who</hi> (says he) <hi>are my mother and my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren?
He that doth the will of my Father, the same
is my mother, and sister, and brother.</hi> And when the
Woman brake forth into that rapture concerning the
blessed Mother of our Lord, <hi>Blessed is the womb that
bare thee, and the paps that gave thee suck!</hi> Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
diverts to another thing, <hi>Yea, rather, blessed are
they that hear the word of God and keep it.</hi> Does either
our Saviour or his Apostles in all their particular Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
and Directions concerning Prayer, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of it, and by whom we are to address our selves to
God, give the least intimation of praying to the Virgin
<hi>Mary,</hi> or making use of her Mediation? And can any
man believe, that if this had been the <hi>practice</hi> of the
Church from the beginning, our <hi>Saviour</hi> and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
would have been so silent about so considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
a part of Religion; insomuch that in all the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles
of the Apostles I do not remember that her
Name is so much as once mentioned? And yet the
worship of her is at this day in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and hath been so for several Ages, a main part of their
publick worship, yea and of their private devotions
too; in which it is usual with them to say <hi>ten Ave
Maries</hi> for <hi>one Pater Noster;</hi> that is, for one Prayer
they make to Almighty God they make ten addresses
to the blessed Virgin; for that is the proportion ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
in their <hi>Rosaries.</hi> He that considers <hi>this;</hi> and
had never seen the <hi>Bible,</hi> would have been apt to think
that there had been more said concerning <hi>Her</hi> in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
than either concerning <hi>God,</hi> or our blessed <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour;</hi>
and that the New<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Testament were full from
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:47159:8"/>
one end to the other of precepts and exhortations to
the worshipping of Her; and yet when all is done, I
challenge any man to shew me so much as one sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
in the whole Bible that sounds that way. And
there is as little in the Christian Writers of the first
three hundred years. The truth is, <hi>this practice</hi> began
to creep in among some superstitious people about the
middle of the <hi>fourth Century:</hi> And I remember par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly,
that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> who lived about that time
calls it the <hi>Heresie of the Women.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus I have given you some Instances of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<hi>Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Practices</hi> which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
have built upon the Foundation of <hi>Christianity.</hi> Much
more might have been said of them, but from what
hath been said any man may easily discern how dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
they are to the salvation of men.</p>
            <p>I proceed now in the second place,</p>
            <p>II. To consider, whether our granting a <hi>possibility
of salvation,</hi> though with great hazard to those in
the Communion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
it to us, be a sufficient argument and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
to any man to quit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> our Church and go to
theirs. And there is the more need to consider this,
because this is the great <hi>popular argument</hi> wherewith
the <hi>emissaries</hi> and <hi>agents</hi> of that Church are wont to
assault our people <hi>Your Church</hi> (say they) <hi>grants
that a Papist may be saved; Ours denies that a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
can be saved; therefore it is safest to be of our
Church, in which salvation by the acknowledgement of
both sides is posible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For answer to this I shall endeavour to shew, that
this is so far from being a <hi>good argument</hi> that it is so
intolerably <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>sophistical</hi> that any considerate
man ought to be asham'd to be catch'd by it. For
either it is good of it self and sufficient to perswade
a man to relinquish our Church, and to pass over to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:47159:9"/>
theirs, without entring into the merits of the cause
on either side, and without comparing the Doctrines
and Practices of both the Churches together, or it is
not. If it be not sufficient <hi>of it self</hi> to perswade a man
to leave our Church, without comparing the Doctrines
on both sides, then it is to no purpose, and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
got by it. For if upon examination and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
of Doctrines the one appear to be <hi>true</hi> and the
other <hi>false,</hi> this alone is a sufficient inducement to any
man to cleave to that Church where the true Doctrine
is found; and then there is no need of this argument.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If it be said, that this argument is good in it self
without the examination of the Doctrines of both
Churches; this seems a very strange thing for any man
to affirm,</hi> That it is reason enough to a man to be of any
Church, whatever her Doctrines and Practices be, if
she do but damn those that differ from her, and if the
Church that differs from her do but allow a possibility
of salvation in her Communion.</p>
            <p>But they who use this <hi>argument,</hi> pretend that it is
sufficient of it self; and therefore I shall apply my self
to shew, as briefly and plainly as I can, the miserable
<hi>weakness</hi> and <hi>insufficiency</hi> of it to satisfie any mans
conscience or prudence to change his Religion. And
to this end I shall,</p>
            <p>1. Shew the weakness of the <hi>principle</hi> upon which
this <hi>argument</hi> relies.</p>
            <p>2. Give some <hi>parallel instances</hi> by which it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
that it concludes false.</p>
            <p>3. I shall take notice of some <hi>gross absurdities</hi> that
follow from it.</p>
            <p>4. Shew how unfit it is to work upon those to whom
it is propounded. And</p>
            <p>5. How improper it is to be urged by those that
make use of it.</p>
            <p>I. I shall shew the <hi>weakness</hi> of the <hi>principle</hi> upon
which this <hi>argument</hi> relies; And that is this, <hi>That
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:47159:9"/>
whatever different parties in Religion agree in, is sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
to be chosen.</hi> The true consequence of which <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi>
if it be driven to the head, is to perswade men
to forsake Christianity, and to make them take up in
the principles of <hi>natural Religion,</hi> for in these all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions
do agree. For if this <hi>principle</hi> be true, and sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
any thing, it is dangerous to embrace any thing
wherein the several parties in Religion differ; because
that only is safe and prudent to be chosen wherein all
agree. So that this <hi>argument,</hi> if the foundation of it
be good, will perswade further than those who make
use of it desire it should do; for it will not only make
men forsake the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> but <hi>Popery</hi> too;
&amp; which is much more considerable, <hi>Christianity</hi> it self.</p>
            <p>II. I will give some <hi>parallel instances</hi> by which it
will clearly be seen that this <hi>argument</hi> concludes false.
The <hi>Donatists</hi> denied the Baptism of the <hi>Catholicks</hi>
to be good, but the <hi>Catholicks</hi> acknowledged the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
of the <hi>Donatists</hi> to be valid. So that both sides
were agreed that the Baptism of the <hi>Donatists</hi> was
good, therefore the safest way for St. <hi>Austin</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Catholicks</hi> (according to this <hi>argument)</hi> was to
be Baptized again by the <hi>Donatists,</hi> because by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment
of both sides Baptism among them
was valid.</p>
            <p>But to come nearer to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Several
in that Church hold <hi>the personal Infallibility of the
Pope and the lawfulness of deposing and killing Kings
for Heresie</hi> to be <hi>de fide,</hi> that is, necessary Articles of
Faith, and consequently, that whoever does not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
them cannot be saved. But a great many <hi>Papists,</hi>
though they believe these things to be no matters of
Faith, yet they think those that hold them may be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and they are generally very favourable towards
them. But now, according to this <hi>argument,</hi> they
ought all to be of their opinion in these points, because
both sides are agreed that <hi>they that hold them may be
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:47159:10"/>
saved;</hi> but one side positively says that <hi>men cannot
be saved if they do not hold them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But my Text furnisheth me with as good an instance
to this purpose as can be desired. St. <hi>Paul</hi> here in the
Text acknowledgeth the <hi>possibility</hi> of the <hi>salvation</hi>
of those <hi>who built hay and stubble upon the foundation
of Christianity; that they might be saved,</hi> though
with great difficulty, and as it were <hi>out of the fire.</hi> But
now among those builders with hay and stubble there
were those who denied the possibility of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
and of those who were of his mind. We are
told of some who built the <hi>Jewish</hi> Ceremonies and
Observances upon the foundation of Christianity, and
said that unless men were Circumcised and kept the
Law of <hi>Moses</hi> they could not be saved. So that by
this argument St. <hi>Paul</hi> and hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> followers ought to have
gone over to those <hi>Judaizing Christians,</hi> because it
was acknowledged on both sides that they might be
saved. But these <hi>Judaizing Christians</hi> were as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable
to St. <hi>Paul</hi> and other Christians as the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is now to us, for they said positively
<hi>that they could not be saved.</hi> But can any man think
that St. <hi>Paul</hi> would have been moved by this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to leave a safe and certain way of salvation for
that which was only possible, and that with great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
and hazard? The argument you see is the very
same, and yet it concludes the wrong way; which
plainly shews that it is a <hi>contingent argument,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
uncertainly and by chance, and therefore no
man ought to be moved by it.</p>
            <p>III. I shall take notice of some <hi>gross absurdities</hi> that
follow from it. I shall mention but these two.</p>
            <p>1. According to this <hi>principle</hi> it is always safest to
be on the <hi>uncharitable side.</hi> And yet uncharitableness
is as bad an evidence, either of a true Christian, or a
true Church, as a man would wish. <hi>Charity</hi> is one of
the most essential marks of Christianity, and what the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:47159:10"/>
Apostle saith of particular Christians is as true of
whole Churches, that <hi>though they have all Faith, yet
if they have not Charity they are nothing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I grant that no Charity teacheth men to see others
damned, and not to tell them the danger of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
But it is to be consider'd that the damning
of men is a very hard thing, and therefore whenever
we do it the case must be wonderfully plain. And is
it so in this matter? They of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
deny but that we embrace all the Doctrines of our
Saviour, contain'd in the Apostles Creed and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
by the four first General Councils: And yet
they will not allow this and a good life to put us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a possibility of salvation, because we will not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to all the innovations they would impose upon us.
And yet I think there is scarce any <hi>Doctrine</hi> or <hi>Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice</hi>
in difference between them and us, which some
or other of their most learned Writers have not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
either not to be sufficiently contained in
Scripture, or not to have been held and practised by
the primitive Church: so that nothing can excuse their
uncharitableness towards us. And they pay dear for
the little advantage they get by this <hi>argument,</hi> for they
do what in them lies to make themselves no Chisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
that they may prove themselves the truer and more
Christian Church; A <hi>medium</hi> which we do not desire
to make use of.</p>
            <p>2. If this <hi>argument</hi> were good, then by this trick a
man may bring over all the world to agree with him
in an error which another does not account damnable,
whatever it be, provided he do but damn all those
that do not hold it; and there wants nothing but
<hi>confidence</hi> and <hi>uncharitableness</hi> to do this. But is
there any sense, that another mans boldness and want
of charity should be an argument to move me to be
of his opinion? I cannot illustrate this better, than
by the difference between a skilfull Physician and a
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:47159:11"/>
Mountebank. A <hi>learned</hi> and <hi>skilfull Physician</hi> is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest,
and speaks justly of things: He says, that such a
method of cure which he hath directed is safe, and
withall, that that which the <hi>Mountebank</hi> prescribes
may possibly do the work, but there is great hazard
and danger in it: But the <hi>Mountebank,</hi> who never
talks of any thing less than <hi>infallible cures,</hi> (and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
the more <hi>Mountebank,</hi> the stronger pretence to
<hi>infallibility)</hi> he is <hi>positive</hi> that that method which
the <hi>Physician</hi> prescribes will destroy the Patient, but
his receipt is infallible and never fails. Is there any
reason in this case, that this man should carry it
meerly by his <hi>confidence?</hi> And yet if this <hi>argument</hi>
be good, the safest way is to reject the <hi>Physicians</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
and to stick to the <hi>Mountebanks.</hi> For both sides
are agreed, that there is a possibility of cure in the
<hi>Mountebank's</hi> method, but not in the <hi>Physician's;</hi>
and so the whole force of the argument lies in the
<hi>confidence</hi> of an <hi>ignorant man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IV. This <hi>argument</hi> is very unfit to work upon
<hi>those</hi> to whom it is propounded: For either they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
we say true in this, or not. If they think we do
not, they have no reason to be moved by what we
say. If they think we do, why do they not take in
all that we say in this matter? Namely, that though
it be possible for some in the communion of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Church to be saved, yet it is very hazardous;
and that they are in a safe condition already in our
Church. And why then should a <hi>bare possibility,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with infinite and apparent hazard, be an
argument to any man to run into that danger?</p>
            <p>Lastly, this <hi>argument</hi> is very improper to be urged
by those who make use of it. Half of the strength of it
lies in this, that we <hi>Protestants</hi> acknowledge that <hi>it
is possible a Papist may be saved.</hi> But why should
they lay any stress upon this? What matter is it what
we Hereticks say, who are so damnably mistaken in
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:47159:11"/>
all other things? Methinks, if there were no other
reason, yet because we say it, it should seem to them
to be unlikely to be true. But I perceive when it
serves for their purpose we have some little credit and
authority among them.</p>
            <p>By this time I hope every one is in some measure
satisfied of the <hi>weakness of this argument,</hi> which is so
transparent that no wise man can honestly use it, and
he must have a very odd understanding that can be
cheated by it. The truth is, it is a <hi>casual and contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
argument,</hi> and sometimes it concludes right, and
oftner wrong; and therefore no prudent man can be
moved by it, except only in one case, when all things
are so equal on both sides that there is nothing else in
the whole world to determine him; which surely can
never happen in matters of Religion necessary to be
believed. No man is so weak, as not to consider in
the change of his Religion the <hi>merits</hi> of the <hi>cause it
self;</hi> as not to examine the <hi>Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Practices</hi>
of the Churches on both sides; as not to take notice
of the <hi>confidence</hi> and <hi>charity</hi> of both Parties, together
with all other things which ought to move a conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
and a prudent man: And if upon enquiry there
appear to be a clear advantage on either side, then
this <hi>argument</hi> is needless and comes too late, because
the work is already done without it.</p>
            <p>Besides, that the great hazard of salvation in the
<hi>Roman</hi> Church (which we declare upon account of
the <hi>Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Practices</hi> which I have mentioned)
ought to deter any man much more from that Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
than the acknowledged possibility of salvation in
it ought to encourage any man to the embracing of it:
Never did any Christian Church build so much <hi>hay</hi> and
<hi>stubble</hi> upon the <hi>foundation</hi> of Christianity, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>those that are saved in it must be saved,</hi> as it
were, <hi>out of the fire.</hi> And though <hi>Purgatory</hi> be not
meant in the Text, yet it is a Doctrine very well suited
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:47159:12"/>
to their manner of building; for there is need of an
<hi>ignis purgatorius,</hi> of a <hi>fire</hi> to try their work what it is,
and to <hi>burn</hi> up their <hi>hay</hi> and <hi>stubble.</hi> And I have so
much Charity (and I desire always to have it) as to
hope, that a great many among them who live pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
and have been almost inevitably detain'd in that
Church by the prejudice of education and an invinsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ignorance, will upon a <hi>general repentance</hi> find
mercy with God; <hi>and though their work suffer loss
and be burnt,</hi> yet <hi>they themselves may escape, as out of
the fire.</hi> but as for those who had the opportunities
of coming to the knowledge of the truth, if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in the errors of that Church, or apostatize from
the truth, I think their condition so far from being
safe that there must be extraordinary favourable cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
in their case to give a man hopes of their
salvation.</p>
            <p>I have now done with the <hi>two</hi> things I propounded
to speak to. And I am sorry that the <hi>necessary defence</hi>
of our Religion, against the <hi>restless importunities</hi> and
<hi>attempts</hi> of our adversaries upon all sorts of persons
hath engaged me to spend so much time in matters
of dispute, which I had much rather have employed
in another way. Many of you can be my witnesses
that I have constantly made it my business, in this
great Presence and Assembly to plead against the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties</hi>
and <hi>wickedness</hi> of men, and have endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by the best arguments I could think of, to gain
men over to a <hi>firm belief</hi> and serious <hi>practice</hi> of the
main things of Religion. And, I do assure you, I
had much rather perswade any one to be a good
man, than to be of any party or denomination of
Christians whatsoever. For I doubt not, but the <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of the ancient Creed,</hi> provided we entertain no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that is destructive of it, <hi>together with a good
life, will certainly save a man;</hi> and without this no
man can have reasonable hopes of salvation, no not
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:47159:12"/>
an infallible Church, if there were any such to be
found in the world.</p>
            <p>I have been, according to my opportunities, not a
negligent observer of the <hi>genius</hi> and humour of the
several Sects and Professions in Religion. And upon
the whole matter, I do in my conscience believe the
Church of <hi>England</hi> to be the best constituted Church
this day in the world; and that, as to the main, the
<hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi> and <hi>Worship</hi> of it, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently
framed to make men <hi>soberly Religious:</hi> Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
men on the one hand, from the wild freaks of
<hi>Enthusiasm;</hi> and on the other, from the gross follies
of <hi>Superstition.</hi> And our Church hath this peculiar
advantage above several Professions that we know in
the world, that it acknowledgeth a due and just sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination
to the <hi>civil Authority,</hi> and hath always
been untainted in its <hi>loyalty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now shall every trifling consideration be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to move a man to relinquish such a Church?
There is no greater disparagement to a mans under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
no greater argument of a light and ungene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
mind, than rashly to change ones Religion. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>
is our greatest concernment of all other, and it
is not every <hi>little argument,</hi> no nor a great noise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<hi>infallibility,</hi> nothing but very <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
evidence,</hi> that should sway a man in this case.
But they are utterly inexcusable who make a change
of such concernment upon the insinuations of one side
only, without ever hearing what can be said for the
Church they were baptized and brought up in before
they leave it. They that can yield thus easily to the
impressions of every one that hath a design and interest
to make <hi>Proselytes</hi> may at this rate of discretion change
their <hi>Religion</hi> twice a day, and instead of <hi>morning</hi>
and <hi>evening Prayer</hi> they may have a <hi>morning</hi> and <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening
Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:47159:13"/>
Therefore for God's sake, and for our own Souls
sake, and for the sake of our Reputation, let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
and <hi>shew our selves men;</hi> let us not suffer our
selves to be shaken and carried away with every wind.
Let us not run our selves into danger when we may
be safe. Let us stick to the <hi>foundation of Religion,</hi>
the <hi>Articles</hi> of our <hi>common belief,</hi> and build upon
them gold, and silver, and precious stones; I mean,
the <hi>vertues and actions of a good life;</hi> and if we would
do this, we should not be apt to set such a value upon
<hi>hay</hi> and <hi>stubble.</hi> If we would sincerely endeavour to
live <hi>holy and vertuous lives,</hi> we should not need to
cast about for a <hi>Religion</hi> which may furnish us with
easie and indirect ways to get to Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I will conclude all with the Apostles Exhortation,</hi>
Wherefore my beloved brethren be ye stedfast and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movable,
always abounding in the work of the Lord.</p>
            <p>Now the God of peace which brought again from the
dead our Lord Jesus Christ, the great Shepherd of the
Sheep, by the bloud of the everlasting Covenant, make
you perfect in every good work, to doe his will; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
in you that which is well-pleasing in his sight,
through Jesus Christ, to whom be Glory for ever and
ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>
