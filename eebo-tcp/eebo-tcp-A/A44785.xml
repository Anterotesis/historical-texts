         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE man-childe which was caught up unto the
throne of God, when the red Dragon sought
to devour and destroy him, hath appeared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
in power and great glory, after the long
and cruell tyranny of the Dragon, wherein
she hath killed the Saints, and prevailed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them, and hath made great war, spoil
and havock of the remnant of the womans seed, this 13. or
14 hundred years, aud hath compelled all both small and
great (whose names have not been written in the Lambs
book of life) to worship him, and the Beast, unto whom he
hath given great authority to kill, and to destroy whosoever
worshipped the God of heaven, that so they might be worn
out, and all the earth might worship him, and feare him,
and extoll him, and his authority. Now the time, times,
and a halfe being near an end, that <hi>John</hi> saw the woman
should be retired in the Wildernesse, she appearing again in
her beautifull garments, and her heir and her seed appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
again after the long night of darknesse.</p>
            <p>Now when the Lord in this the day of his power is appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
again, and the man-childe that is to rule the Nations
with a rod of iron. Now the Dragon, Beast, Whore, and
false Prophet, and all the mystery of Iniquity, <hi>Gog</hi> and
<hi>Magog,</hi> and all Apostates, Deceivers, and Merchants of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi>
that have traded upon the waters upon which the
whore sits, they are all up in armes, every one with his
weapons which he hath formed in the bottomlesse pit, is
now set in array against the Lamb who is risen; the Priests,
hirelings, and <hi>Babylons</hi> Merchants, who have got so great
gain by Sea, they have given the first on-set in the front, of
the black army of the Dragon, and this sixe or seven years
hath made a great noyse, and hath raised so much smoak
out of the pit, that they have darkned the ayre, and made
it cloudy, and hath filled the earth with a great noise, that
many have admired what the issue would be, and what the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:31720:3"/>
event might prove; but now many who have waited in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
have seen the Lamb appear, and have seen his rising
in majesty, and hath prevailed; And many of them who
gave the first on-set grows weary, seeing the battel goes too
hard against them, and the Lamb and his followers prevail.
And now comes on the tail of the Dragon as the reserve,
and the rear of the Beast, among whom <hi>Edward Dod</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
and he thinks to prevail, and get himselfe a name,
and to do exploits; but alass, all his weapons are but the old
broken bowes and the spear is that are strewed up and down
the field of confusion, which we have run over and over,
and trampled upon, and esteems them no more then rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
wood: He hath raked up those things which have been
answered over and over, and that which the rest of the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons
army hath vomited up, before in the beginning, he
hath licked up, and now vomits it out again, and casts out
floods of poysoned words, false accusations, and arrogant
reproaches, and proud disdainful speeches, as though his
tongue were his own; And like one of <hi>Ishmaels</hi> brood, scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and deriding at innocency, and saith, he hath laid down
some of our Tenets, and named them, and shamed them.
All sober people who know any thing of God, will see thou
hast shamed thy selfe, and not us, in uttering forth thy fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
And thy title of thy Book demonstrates what is within
it, the beginning is scorn and derision, the end is folly and
madnesse, and many ignorant words uttered forth from
a corrupt heart and unbridled tongue, which is bent to do
mischief, and to speak falshood; but lest thou shouldst glory
in the old rotten broken weapons which thou hast taken up,
which were formed by thy leaders, and not by thee, which
we have answered again and again, and have over-run them
as stubble; which answers have cleared the truth to all sober
people, that they see all your weapons are but carnall, and
not spirituall, and they have no might in them at all to
stand against the truth, nor them who are made free by it,
whose weapons are spirituall and mighty through God to
beat down strong holds of darknesse, and the towers of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance.
Many are beat down already, and the Lamb is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:31720:3"/>
and upon the white horse, and a numberlesse number
is following him, who rides on after him, who shall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
the Nations to himselfe, and break the yoke of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly,
and deliver the oppressed, and no weapon that is
formed against him shall prosper. I say, lest thou shouldst
boast, I shall return these lines in answer to thy book.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thy book thou titles,</hi> A pair of Spectacles for a dark-sighted
Quaker.</p>
            <p>I say thy Spectacles are more like to make ones sight dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
then through them to be made to see, they are such
wooden ones; but the <hi>Quakers</hi> sees before thee, and beyond
thee, and comprehends thee, and have received eye-salve,
whereby their eyes are opened to see thy deceit, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
of the treacherous generation with whom thou art joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and thy rejoynder and vindication of <hi>Samuel Smith,</hi>
whom thou calls Minister of the Word at <hi>Cressage</hi> in the
County of <hi>Satop;</hi> thy vindication of him, and thy pleading
for him, will not bring much honour to neither him nor
thee; and though thou and he both ioyne hand in hand in
deceit, yet you shall not go unpunished.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thou tels the Reader</hi> of wandering Planets who have left
their station, who have stepped upon the Stage in the County of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop,</hi>
who are come forth in this apostatizing time.</p>
            <p>All who have a good understanding, may clearly see not
onely in the County of <hi>Salop,</hi> but also in every corner of
the Land, many wandering Stars that have no habitation in
the Firmament of Gods power, but are tossed up and down,
and are as waters, unstable, tossed too and fro with every
winde; and the change of one Magistrate, or head Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
will make them all change their forme; and as thou
calls it, <hi>metamorphize them into another shape,</hi> witnesse the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
publique Teachers, and Parish-masters, and tithing
Priests in the dayes of <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth, <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. Queen
<hi>Mary,</hi> and Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> dayes, and now of late in the
Bishops dayes, when the Magistrates voted down the Bish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops,
all or most of the Priests denied their Fathers, and
their institution; and though they ordained them Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
yet they denied them, and now are got into their
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:31720:4"/>
seats and Benefices, and there thy Reader may see the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphosed
changelings, and the apostates; and I do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the County of <hi>Salop</hi> abounds with such like; and they
have been on the Stage long, and have acted such a part in
every generation, as would please the present Authority,
or power, whether they were Papists or Protestants, Prelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
or whatsoever; but <hi>F. D</hi> the <hi>Exit</hi> will come, and when
the day appears, the beasts must go into <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>heir dens again:
and thou confesseth you live in apostatizing times; thou
that art among the Apostates, and in the apostatizing age
and time, would accuse others: Nay, thou must hold thy
peace, and leave pleading for Apostates, and for the fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the heathen which hath got up since the dayes of the
apostacy, which the whole scope of thy Book is full of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else; and we cannot permit or allow them who are in
the time of apostacy, and who are one with the Apostates,
which have wandered after the Beast since the dayes of the
Apostles. I say, we cannot allow such as you to be Judges;
for we are come out of the apostacy, and to before the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postates,
and to before the wandering Stars, and thou hast
mist it much that tells the <hi>Quakers</hi> are they. <hi>Edward,</hi> I tell
thee, we are come to the everlasting Gospell again, and
have received it, and it's the power of God, which was to
be, and is to be preached again to the Nations after the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postacy.</p>
            <p>And as for the Book called <hi>Malice stript &amp; whipt</hi> I have seen
it; and the spirit of thy Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> whom thou calls <hi>Reverend,</hi>
thou hast elevated him as high as the Pope; but <hi>E. D.</hi> what
is the reason thou reverencest him so much as thou doth to
thy Reader? And in the tenth page thou saist, <hi>many souls de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon his Ministery;</hi> and thou <hi>blessest God, for the worke of
God you enjoy in that Congregation.</hi> Thou hast extol'd him too
highly, or else he hath wronged thee grievously; for thou
saist thou hast profited much by him: Thou mayest call to
minde a certain time, when he preached (as you call it) out
of the 13 of <hi>Luke,</hi> and when he spoke of the parable of the
man that planted a Vineyard, and 3 years looked for fruit;
and <hi>Sam: Smith,</hi> whom thou so adores, said, he had sought
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:31720:4"/>
for fruit from your Congregation this 7 yeares at <hi>Cressage,</hi>
and had found none, he shall be an evidence for me against
thee, that thy glorying of him is vain; and it's manifest he
is one the Lord sent his Prophet to declare against, who
hath run, and the Lord never sent him, therefore he hath
not profited you at <hi>Cressage</hi> at all; lean souls are they like to
be that depends on him.</p>
            <div type="observation">
               <head>In the first observation, as thou calls it, thou hast ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
the heads of Samuel Smiths Book into five
particulars, which thou saist we are ashamed to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
or else know not what to say for our defence. I
say unto thee, boast not, when thou putst on thy
Armour, but when thou putst it off; for the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
may be doubtful.</head>
               <p>THe first particular, That the Nationall Ministers doth main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the true worship of God, and the Doctrine of Christ ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the revealed will of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> So saying, and so doing were something; the true
worship of God is in spirit and in truth, which is not <hi>loe here,
and loe there,</hi> nor in outward observations, but in life, in
power, and in truth: But to be brief, both the doctrine
and practice of the Nationall Ministery in generall, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Scripture, which thou calls the Word of God;
(as for instance) their sprinkling of Infants, their teaching
men to swear, and calling it part of the worship of God,
which is contrary to the doctrine of Christ, who said, <hi>swear
not at all.</hi> Their singing <hi>Davids</hi> Psalms put into meeter, by
Poets and Ballad-mongers, singing them in their invented
tunes, which pleaseth the carnall minde; Their studied dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses,
which you call Sermons, invented from the
strength of naturall wit, and not speaking as they are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by the holy Ghost, which the Ministers of Christ in all

In these, and many other things which I could instance,
they are out of the Doctrine of Christ; And in a word, your
whole worship differs both in matter and manner, from the
Saints worship in the primitive times.</p>
               <p>But seeing we have denyed the Nationall Ministers divers
years ago, and have laid down our grounds and reasons to
the world, wherein we have charged them, that their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
is contrary to Scripture; unto which grounds and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
not one Parish-master in <hi>England</hi> hath yet vindicated
themselves these sixe years. And unto that Book called <hi>The
Grounds and Reasons why we deny the Priests,</hi> if the Reader be
not satisfied concerning them, there he may see how they
erre, both in Doctrine, and practice, contrary to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>

            <div type="observation">
               <head>To the second and third Particular.</head>
               <p>That the present government of the Nation is the Ordinance of
God; and that the Ministers bringing offenders before the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
is not persecution.</p>
               <p>As for the present government of the Nation, the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
thereof is not in question by us; but many who are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours,
and should be Executors of the Law, have acted
contrary to Law, (being stirred up by the Priests, who bite
with their teeth, if one put not into their mouths) and
hath caused the just to suffer by giving judgement against
them, in their wills, contrary to Law, or else according to
those Lawes which hath been made in the will of man, in
the transgression, under which we have suffered for the
truths sake, and therein have peace.</p>
               <p>And as for Ministers bringing offenders before Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,
that is an usurped authority, to make a Minister a
Magistrate; but <hi>Edward,</hi> what was the offence? because a
company of people came to <hi>Cressage,</hi> and declared the word
of truth in your Streets; and what if it had been in your
Assembly, this was no offence in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi>
where all might speak one by one, although its become
an offence in your Masse-house at <hi>Cressage;</hi> but the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
may judge in whose steps thou and thy Priest walkes;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:31720:5"/>
you have done the offence, and then accuseth others to the
Magistrates as offenders; Let shame cover your lips, you
impudent men. Hath not <hi>Samuel Smith</hi> in his own Narrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in his book, said, that <hi>William Parrat</hi> Constable, and
<hi>Humphrey Dale</hi> Church-warden, according to the Ministers
direction did pull down the <hi>Quakers</hi> Speaker, charging some
to secure him? And others also of your own County secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by the instigation of the Priest, by his own confession,
in the fourth page of his book.</p>
               <p>And here he and the rest of the society at <hi>Cressage,</hi> who
had a hand in this thing, are manifest to be in the steps of
the Pharisees, whom Christ cried woe against, which cast
out of their Assemblies, and haled the Disciples before the
<hi>Magistrates;</hi> and like the envious Jewes that cryed, <hi>Help
men of Israel; for these men turn the world up-side down;</hi> but you
are worse then they. The Priest was the first fomenter of the
breach of peace, the Constable and Church-warden his
Executioners, and yet thou tells of the <hi>Quakers</hi> being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders.</p>
               <p>Now all sober people will see your envy &amp; deceit, and that
you are in <hi>Cains</hi> way, and by your false flattery and deceit,
would justifie the Magistrate for your own ends, and cause
them to turn the sword against the guiltlesse, which should
be against the transgressor. And who was in the transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
on the Reader may easily judge by that which is fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
and yet the Priest, and you of his Congregation
would make people believe that you did not persecute; the
Priest did give order to pull down the Speaker, the Consta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and Church-warden they acted, and secured your own
Neighbours as prisoners, your own Congregation swearing
against them the breach of peace, and getting them shut up
into prison, and sentence given against them, and yet
thou wouldst have this called equall proceedings; but to
that of God in all consciences, I leave to be Judge in this
things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the fourth and fifth Particular thou saith,</hi> We have
charged to be envious and bitter, and malicious against the most e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
Ministers of the Land.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:31720:6"/>
Them whom thou calls eminent Ministers, hath charged
us with many false things, and have written many false
things against us, for which thou and they in the dreadful
day of the Lord shall give an account. Envy, bitternesse,
and malice is put away from us, and we envy no man, but
speak the truth in sobernesse; and yet to say a lyar is a ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar,
or a deceiver a deceiver, or an hypocrite, an hypocrite,
when they are so, is neither rayling nor malice: Christ, in
whom no guile was found, he said, they were a generation
of vipers, and they were of their Father the Devill, who
were in envy, and went about to kill him. And the Apostle
was not envious when he said, <hi>O full of all subtlety, thou childe
of the Devill,</hi> to one who was doing the work of the Devill;
and many such workers we finde, and many venomous spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
who shoot out poysoned arrows, even bitter words, and
these we must reprove sharply.</p>
               <p>And those things which thou layst to our charge, take to
thy selfe; for the ground of iniquity is in thy heart, from
whence thou hast uttered forth all these disdainful, proud,
&amp; scornful words, of which thou shalt be convinced, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
reproved when the Lord searcheth thy heart, when he
brings anguish and perplexity upon thee, then shalt thou
confesse to his righteous judgement; and so thy five Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
I have answered, which thou sayest thou hast <hi>brought
into thy Booke to fill up the blancks;</hi> they had better have been
blancks still, then have spoyled so much paper with thy ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying
disdainfull scribbles, which is not worth the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering.</p>
               <p>In the third page thou saist, <hi>Thou wilt restate the reputation
of the Ministery of</hi> England <hi>to be Ministers of Christ;</hi> And for
proof, thou hast brought <hi>Col. 1. 7.</hi> and <hi>Rom. 15.</hi> Those words
proves that <hi>Epaphtas</hi> was a faithfull Minister, and that <hi>Paul</hi>
was a Minister of Christ to the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> but what hath this
proved as to the Nationall Priests? nothing at all; and if
thou have no better proof then this to bring them into re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
in stead thereof thou wilt bring defamation upon
them; and when thou shouldst prove them Ministers, thou
proves that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Epaphas</hi> were Ministers, will not the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:31720:6"/>
least in the truth see thee to be a busie-body; but fools will
be medling. Then thou art offended that we call them
<hi>Priests</hi> for receiving of Tythes, I say it's the most proper;
for none but Priests and Levites did receive Tythes, and
how long since is it, since they generally called themselves
the Tribe of <hi>Levi?</hi> For never Minister of the Gospell, nor
of the word of reconciliation, either received tythes, or
commanded that they should be payd, neither reproved
any for not paying; but said, the Priest-hood was changed
and the Law was changed by which tythes were due; but
thou goes on, and makes a sound argument as thou judgest,
and saith, <hi>Abraham paid tythe to</hi> Melchisedeck <hi>before the Law;</hi>
And thou askest <hi>how he did give it, either by the law of nature,
which is called the law of Reason, or by the light within, or by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thou speakst thou knowst not what; where readest thou
of the Law of Nature, called the law of Reason, except it
be in the devised Fables and Stories of the Priests? But
what doth this prove? <hi>Gen. 14. Abraham</hi> gave the tenth part
of the spoyl which he had taken from his enemies, but <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisedeck</hi>
first brought forth bread and wine to <hi>Abrabam</hi> and
his company, and greeted <hi>Abraham</hi> and his company kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and blessed him, and <hi>Abraham</hi> freely gave unto him
the tenth part, <hi>Melchisedeck</hi> desired none; But dost thou
judge, that if <hi>Abraham</hi> had given him none, that he would
have taken by force the tenth part of the spoyl from him?</p>
               <p>Now what doth this prove for the tything Priests of this
Nation? they must first do as <hi>Melchisedeck</hi> did, if they will
have <hi>Melchisedeck</hi> for an example, he blessed <hi>Abraham,</hi> and
brought forth bread and wine unto him and his Army;
but which of the Priests have done so, which have received
tythes; which is not a gift of the people, but a forc't thing
from them? If this must be thy proof for tythes by the gift
of <hi>Abraham,</hi> then let the Priests cease forcing and taking
them till people be freely willing to give them, and then
there will be no complaint: But let us reason a little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of this matter; Would <hi>Melchisedeck</hi> have taken the
tenth, if <hi>Abraham</hi> had not given it him? Or when did
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:31720:7"/>
                  <hi>Melchisedeck,</hi> or any before the Law take away the peoples
Oxen, Cowes, Horses, Sheep, pots and pans, and bedding
upon which poor people lyes, three-fold, four-fold, and
sometime ten-fold; that they claim, or sue people to Courts,
throw them into prison till death, as many evidences we
have in this Nation? Either give us a precept, or an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
before the Law, or under the Gospell, or else stop your
lying mouths and clamorous tongues for ever. Dost thou
and the rest of the Priests think that wee are so ignorant,
that we know not the originall of the tythes in these Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?
a thing invented to fill the Popes coffers, and the
rest of the Clergies budgets, seven or eight hundred years
after the Ascension of Christ? All which Tythes and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
and Obventions were invented in the Apostacy,
since the dayes of the Apostles, and since the woman fled
into the Wildernesse: And the man-childe was caught up
to God, when all the world wondred after the Beast, them
they had their rise<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And when the Kings and Rulers of
these Nations did drinke of the Whores cup, then they
made Lawes to compell the Nations and the people therein
to pay the whores Merchants; and the Popes locusts, which
he sent over the Nations, to fill the earth with their deceit,
which Laws stands yet in force as though they were some di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
institution; but both the tythes and the Law by which
they are compelled to be paid, we deny, and bear our wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
against, as to be things which holds up the Devils
Kingdome; and the Gospel which the Nationall Ministery
holds up and preaches, hath no more ability in it to procure
a maintenance for them, then the Papists Gospell did for
them: So to be brief, the Priests hath the Popes wages for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by a compulsory Law, made and ratified by them who
owned the Popes supremacy.</p>
               <p>Furthermore we assert, that tythes were never due by
divine ordination, but onely to the Priests &amp; Levites in the
first Covenant, nor never were commanded to be paid but
in the Land of <hi>anaan;</hi> and who so upholds the Ordinances
of the first Priest-hood, denies the ordinances of the second:
So this commandement to pay tythes now to them, who are
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:31720:7"/>
neither of <hi>Aarons,</hi> nor <hi>Levies</hi> Tribe, and by us who are
not in Canaan temporall, nor of <hi>Israel</hi> according to the
flesh, the Commandement by which tythes were due in
the first Priest-hood, reaches not unto us. And after
Christs ascension, nor one of the Apostles either comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
or required any such practice of the Saints, either to
<hi>Colossia, Corinth, Antioch, Philippi, Pergamos,</hi> or the rest
of the Churches of <hi>Asia.</hi> So that it's evident to all judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
men, that this is quite another thing got up in the
Apostacy, which no Minister or believer ever did own who
were witnesses of the second Covenant; but any who are
not satisfied in this thing by what I have said, which
much more I could say concerning this thing; but I refer
them that are not satisfied, to a Book called, <hi>The great case
of Tythes stated,</hi> published by <hi>A. P.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In thy fourth and fifth page thou art pleading <hi>for master<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
for thy Ministers,</hi> and so by thy own argument thou
hast proved them out of the doctrine of Christ, who said
to his Ministers, <hi>Call no man Master,</hi> neither be ye called
Masters; but to oppose this, thou brings <hi>John 3. 10.</hi> how
Christ said to <hi>Nichodemus, art thou a Master in Israel?</hi> And
then thou vaporest, and saist, these are not the words of
Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> but Christs. In some translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it is <hi>Ruler in Israel.</hi> In another, <hi>Teacher in Israel:</hi> But
it may be, some who coveted after mastership as thou dost,
hath put in Master for Ruler and Teacher; but grant the
word Master, Christ testified that the <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi>
that they were called of men Master, and reprehended
them for it: And if he did say to <hi>Nichodemas,</hi> art thou a
master? he spoke but in their language, not with appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
of their being so called; for it's manifest he gave a
contrary command to his Disciples, and the commands
of Christ did not contradict one another. And as for <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard
Baxter</hi> and <hi>Samuel Smith,</hi> whose works thou saith doth
witnesse for them beyond thy testimony.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>R. B.</hi> his works are manifest to be works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
many false lyes and reproaches he hath cast upon
the living truth of God, and hath been a great opposer
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:31720:8"/>
of the strait way of the Lord, for which the Lord will plead
with him and you all in the day of his righteous judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And as for <hi>S. S.</hi> let his owne testimony evidence
what his worke is, who said in the Congregation at <hi>Cres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage,</hi>
he had look't for fruit seven years among them, but
found none: So it's manifest he is such a workman as may
be ashamed of his work.</p>
               <p>In thy sixth and seventh page thou sayest, <hi>the Pharisaical
Quakers makes voyd the fifth Commandement, because they do
not put off their hats to politicall and spirituall Fathers,</hi> as thou
calls them; and thou heapst up a great deal of Scripture
to no purpose, not one word in them all doth prove any
such thing, as putting off hats either to Fathers spiritual
or temporall, and so thou art a perverter and a wrester of
it to thy owne destruction; and thou cites <hi>Rom. 13. 7.</hi> to
prove putting off hats, render to all their dues, <hi>tribute to
whom tribute; and this is the tribute of the Nation,</hi> thou saith.
And the 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 13. Submit your selves to every ordinance of
man,</hi> this thou bringst. Ignorant block, shew us either in
plain Scripture or example from the Saints, where it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
or commended, or from any ordinance of man,
or else cease thy foolish clamour, and learn a bridle for
thy tongue, and cease thy foolish inferences. If the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
had no better tribute then putting off the hat,
they would soon be poor Rulers: And whereas thou callest
it <hi>Civill worship, doffing the hat, and bowing the knee,</hi> I know
no more civility in it, then if thou should put off thy Coat
or thy Doublet to every one thou meetest with; And most
of this which thou calls civility, is the most practised by
them who are the rudest, vainest, and the phantastickst
proud Anticks in the Nations, who are full of flattery and
deceit, and vaine complements; and to a proud fellow
which hath a gay cloak, or powdered hayr, and a <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
silver lace dawbed upon his cloaths, then off goes the hat,
and the knee bowes, <hi>and your servant Sir, and your servant my
Lord, or your most humble servant, or thrice humble servant;</hi>
when if he were commanded to do service to such a one,
would not do any thing materiall, but disdain him; And
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:31720:8"/>
meet then with a plain man, who will not complement,
and then <hi>sirrah, &amp; unmannerly Clown,</hi> and be ready to fight;
and this spirit rules the most in those men, who are so full
of their Complements, that begets one another into pride
and deceit, and provoke one another by their bad exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
into deceit, like drunkards, drinking one to another to
make one another drunk, it's like thou wilt call this civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
too: And if thou wilt plead, it's the custome of the
Nation, doffing hats, and bowing.</p>
               <p>The customes of the Heathen are vain, and many In <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>
who feared the Lord were not to walk after the customes
of the Nations; for this deceit was not from the beginning,
and who ever comes to be a follower of Christ, who received
no honour of men, neither respected persons, will deny
this deceit. Take him for thy example, rather then a
company of Fidlers, and Roysters, and Ruffins, who are
without the feare of God; and Christ who is the Saints
example, he said, how can you believe, that seek and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
houour one of another: So then, they were unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
who sought and received honour one of another;
and wouldst thou and the rest who live in deceit, brin<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
the custome of unbelievers, and the practice of unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
among the Saints, who are believers, and follows
Christ their example? I say we have no such custome, nor
the Churches of Christ,</p>
               <p>The next piece of deceit thou art pleading for, is bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to one another the knee, and titles of honour, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Devill hath a great hold among people. <hi>Gen. 44. 14.</hi>
This thou bringst to prove bowing; <hi>Jadah</hi> and his brethren
came to <hi>Josephs</hi> house, and they fell on the ground; This
is an example indeed. Wilt thou take another; the same
brethren of <hi>Joseph</hi> sold him when he was a boy, was that
a good act? If thou say nay, I say one is as much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
and commended as the other; for that same that
doth violence, it's the same that respects persons; but
<hi>Abtaham</hi> bowed to the children of <hi>Heth;</hi> what of that? So
did <hi>Joseph</hi> swear by the life of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and both <hi>Joseph</hi>
and <hi>Abraham</hi> were good men; but they were never the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:31720:9"/>
for these actions, neither the one nor the other: But
then thou brings a Scripture, and thou saith, it must stop
our mouths, <hi>Gen 49. 8. 10.</hi> And thou saith, this may teach
us, if we be of <hi>Jacobs</hi> seed and houshold, to bow to the
God of <hi>Jacob</hi> our King, &amp; why should this stop our mouths?
But the scepter shall not depart from <hi>Judah,</hi> nor a Law-giver
from between his feet till <hi>Shilo</hi> come: So he was to
rule, to wit <hi>Judah,</hi> till <hi>Shilo</hi> came; why should this stop
our mouths? <hi>Shilo</hi> is come, and hath opened our mouths,
and the scepter is departed from <hi>Judah</hi> long since; both
them that bowed to <hi>Iudah,</hi> and <hi>Iudah</hi> that was once bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto, they are both bowed under, and <hi>Shilo</hi> is set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,
and now he must be bowed unto, go learn what that
meanes. It was answered against bowing, the second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
prohibits it, <hi>Thou shalt not bow down to them;</hi> but
the answer satisfies thee not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thou saith,</hi> Doth this forbid civill respects, or idolatrous
worship?</p>
               <p>That which thou calls civill respect is idolatrous worship,
putting off the hat, and bowing the knee to a man with a
gay Cloak, or a gold Ring, or a company of Ribbons, or a
long Gown: To bow downe to such, because of the attire,
is respecting of persons, and idolatry; but you are fallen
into a far worse state then respecting of persons; for you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
cloaths, and doffs your hats, and bow your knees to
them with fine rayment; And let the man in vile rayment
or poor attire go by without either cap or knee, and
for all thy civility thou so greatly pleadest for, and courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
if he put not off his hat to thee, it may be thou wilt
call him Sirrah, Rogue, or Clowne, for all thy civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
               <p>Again, put on the poor man good attire, and a fine
Cloak, and a gold Ring, then you change your note, and
say, <hi>If it please your Worship, or like your Honour, your humble
servant Sir.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now here is not only respecting of persons, which is
commission of sin, but respecting the creatures, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping
the array which is upon a mans back, which is ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:31720:9"/>
and not civility, which is to be condemned; Yet
civility and courtesie I owne, which is so in deed, and in
truth; but that which the world calls civility and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie
is hypocrisie and idolatry; And for Salutations,
thou saith, we seldome use: and thou bringst Scripture
to prove, that Christ and the Saints saluted one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Their salutations are owned, and such salutations are
practised by us in uprightnesse of heart, and true love
without feignednesse; but we cannot do as you do, bid
a man God-speed, when he is not doing the worke of
God, nor say <hi>Farewell</hi> to them who are in their evill
deeds; nor as the world doth, with their <hi>Good-evens,</hi>
and <hi>Good-morrows,</hi> and takes Gods name in vain; and if
one do not answer them according to their light vaine
mindes, they will fall a rayling and beating; all such spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
we deny, and their salutations.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="observation">
               <head>In thy second Observation.</head>
               <p>Thou saith, <hi>Do not we prove, that places of Christian As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies
to be a Church,</hi> and thou brings many Scriptures
to no purpose. Thou bringst the 1 of <hi>Kings,</hi> vers. 8. and
<hi>1 Cor. 11. For the glory of the Lord shall fill the house of the
Lord.</hi> And thou answerest, and saist, <hi>not the Steeple-house,
but the Church.</hi> There thou hast added to the Scripture,
and divers other Scriptures thou bringest, wherein the
Temple was called the house of God, and the store-hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
were called the house of God, <hi>Mal. 3. 10.</hi> All which
Scriptures I own; but they are nothing to thy purpose;
that the Temple was called the house of God, and the
Tabernacle the house of God, and the Store-houses the
house of God, this is granted. These were made and
builded according to the command of God, wherein the
Lords treasure was which fed the poor, the fatherlesse,

God.</p>
               <p>Thou and thy Master <hi>Smith</hi> art offended that we call

Why not? Huth not these houses Steeples? But we shall

hath the Crosses standing upon them yet, or an <hi>Idols Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
which was dedicated for the idolatrous worship, and
for the Idoll Masse, and other superstitious ceremonies;
your windows full of pictures, your walls full of images,
and Monks faces, and bears yet the Popish names, as St.
<hi>Anthony,</hi> St. <hi>Clement,</hi> St. <hi>Dunstans,</hi> and St. <hi>Patrick,</hi> and
St. <hi>Maries,</hi> and the like.</p>
               <p>You blinde men, full of ignorance, perverters of the
Scriptures, which would bring the Scripture to prove your
idolatrous Masse-house to be a Church, and calls it the
house of God, &amp; Temple of God, when the first Founder
was an Apostate; and you who hold it up, and calls it a
Church, are of his brood, and are dead stones, which
worhips in the dead house, and knows not what the
Church of God is; and yet you say, to what end should
we bring Scripture to prove any thing by to these men;
take it not into your mouths, except you bring it for a
better end, to make people believe that the Prophets and
Apostles when they spoke of the house of God, and the
Church of God, spoke of your Idoll-temple, or ever
intended or meant your Steeple-house, or old Masse-house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And thou saith,</hi> Few of the Ministers in <hi>England thou</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
henceforth will have any thing to do with us, for we are blind
leaders of the blinde.</p>
               <p>I believe they see sufficiently they have come to great
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:31720:10"/>
losse, and sees their weapons have not prevailed, but
are become all like broken bowes, in which there is no
strength, which they may all lay downe in the field of
confusion where they set their battell; but the Lamb
hath prevailed, and his weapons are spirituall, and they
who follow him are skilfull to handle the sword, and are
able to make War with the Beast and all his followers; and
many are overcome, and the rest shall be subdued, and
the day hastneth greatly, that they shall melt away that
hate the Lord.</p>
               <p>And as for Christs saying, let them alone, <hi>they are blinde
leaders of the blinde.</hi> This he spoke of thy generation the
Pharisees, who were called of men Master, and loved
greeting in the Streets and Market-places, and stood
praying in the Synagogue, in whose foot-steps the Priests
of <hi>England</hi> are, which Christ cryed wo against, and now
they are seen to be blinde guides, and leaders of the
blinde; for they whose eyes Christ hath opened, hath
ceased from such, and now bears their testimony against
such.</p>
               <p>In the eleventh page thou goes on in thy blindenesse
and ignorance, pleading for your publique place of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
the old Masse-house, set up by the injunction of
the Pope; And you have taken their houses into your
hands, and scoulds against them in it, when you are in
the same nature: And thou bidst us read what conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
and enemies of God use to do, in <hi>Pslam 83. 3, 4.</hi>
They said, <hi>Let us take to our selves the houses of God in
possession.</hi> This was spoken of the Heathen, of <hi>Gebal, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
and <hi>Amaleck,</hi> and the men of <hi>Tyre;</hi> who devoured,
and destroyed, and sought to destroy the Store-houses
and Synagogues that were used in the first Covenant.
And thou mayest take the application home to thy selfe,
and to the generation thou art pleading for: Have not
the Papists good ground to plead with you in this behalf?
Was not the Abbies, Monasteries, Masse-houses, Tythes,
Oblations, and Obventions, <hi>Easter</hi> reckonings, <hi>Peter-</hi>pence,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:31720:11"/>
the Papists and Jesuites maintenance? And did
not <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, who was the first establisher of
your Religion in this Nation, Did not he take them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from the Papists? and then the Priests who denyed
their holy Father the Pope, got their tythes and the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
and took the Masse-houses into their hands,
and the tythes and <hi>Easter</hi> reckonings: And if thou call
these Gods houses, and this Gods maintenance for his
Ministers which maintained Popery, Then thou hast
brought all these Scriptures against thy selfe, and thou
art in a great transgression; and your Schooles and
Colledges which thou ignorantly callest the Schools of
the Prophets, like an unlearned man, aud Schools of
piety, then the Papists were Prophets, and they were
pious; For these Schooles and Colledges were invented
by them, and you have gotten these from them, to wit,
the Masse-house, Schools, Colledges, Tythes, Oblations,
the Papists maintenance, and their hire, aud this is
lawfull in your eyes, and yet you will call them impious
and idolators: Are not the things the same in your hands
as they were in theirs? but these things are quite another
thing then was in the first Covenant. These things are
not to be paralleld with the Synagogues, Temples,
Store-houses, Tythes under the Law, for these were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
since the Apostles dayes; and the Apostates, who
went from the life invented them, when all wondered
after the Beast, and never mention a word of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as to thinke to prove these invented trumperies;
for the Scripture never intends, nor them that spoke it
forth, to patronize your deceit in these things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object. But it may be thou maist say,</hi> Though these
things fore-mentioned were set up by Idolaters, and the places were
made for an Idolatrous service, and the maintenance and hire
were to maintain Idolatrous Priests; but now they are converted
to a better use, and they are convenient to meet in, and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for our Ministers maintenance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Did ever any of the Ministers or Apostles of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:31720:11"/>
Christ goe into the <hi>Iewes</hi> Temple or Synagogues to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
after Christ was ascended, except it was to declare
against them, and to bring people off them; or did they
take the Jewish Priests maintenance, which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to be payd of God? or did the Ministers of
Christ exhort the <hi>Jewes</hi> that believed, to build a Temple
or a Synagogue to worship in? Or did any of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of Christ go into the Temples of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
or into the high places of the <hi>Iews?</hi> Or did they
receive the Idoll Priests maintenance, or the Jewish
tythes, or eate that which was sacrificed to Idols? If nay,
where is your example; I know you dare not plead com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
from the Lord for these things. Might not the
Jewes, when they had broken down the Altars of <hi>Baal,</hi>
and destroyed the Images and high places, and the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of them, have said, these are convenient places for
worship, let us now worship here for conveniency; and
that maintenance of offerings that was offered to Idols,
let's take them, and give them to our Priests and Levites,
and let us offer them unto God? If these things had been
justifiable, then yours are justifiable now; but if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnable
then, yours condemnable now; and so let
your mouths be stopped and speak no more so proudly,
nor bring no more such impertinent proofs and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for your deceit; for that is enjoyed that weighes
you all, and can judge all your deceit.</p>
               <p>And for <hi>Barbarisme,</hi> and <hi>Heathenisme,</hi> and <hi>Heresie</hi> thou
speaks on, which layes the Lords vineyard waste, it's
brought in, and dwels among you, and the fruits are
manifest in most of your Steeple-houses or Masse-house
as witnesse your ringing of Pans, Candlesticks, Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-pans,
throwing water, and rude behaviour,
which hath been used by your Church-members, as
fighting, beating, punching, tearing of cloaths, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
out of your Assemblies them that come in the Name
of the Lord; and these be the fruits of barbarous Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
which are not brought forth any where but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:31720:12"/>
you; but it may be thou wilt call this civility and
courtesie, and the tribute of the Nation: And for here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
both in Doctrine and Worship, none are to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
unto you for unsoundnesse and ignorance; for I
looke upon you as the tayle of all the people in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
And the Vineyard of God that thou speaks on, is no
where layd waste so much as among you masse-house wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippers;
for you are like bryars and thornes, scratching,
rending, tearing and haling, and are as a field untilled,
and as a waste howling Wildernesse, that knowes not
when good comes; and that your Ministers are those
proud phantastick sprits that have taken upon them to
preach, who denies an immediate call. Neither are they
approved of his Church which is in God, the pillar
and ground of truth; but onely they are approved by
man, and by the Colledges, which were invented by
the Pope, where more deceit and foolish fopperies are
practiced, then in any society in the Nation besides;
for them that denies an immediate call, and an infallible
spirit, I deny them to be any Ministers of Christ, and
so doth the Church of Christ who meet in his Name; but
such are your Ministers, therefore we have turned from
them many years ago.</p>
               <p>And the next thing that thou art offended at is, that a
woman spoke in a meeting near <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>; what if ten had spoke,
if they had spoke by the Spirit of the Lord, what offence
had it been? Did not God promise by <hi>Ioel,</hi> that he would
pour forth his spirit upon his Daughters, and they should
prophesie? and wouldest thou stop them? And <hi>Priscilla</hi>
instructed a Minister, better then any of your Parish ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
Priests, to wit, <hi>Apollo.</hi> And had not <hi>Philip</hi> three
daughters did prophesie? And was there not women
with <hi>Clement</hi> that were fellow-labourers in the Gospell?
(And what though she that was in the transgression was
to keep silence in the Church?) Doth it therefore follow
that they that are come out of the transgression, are to
be silent in the Church? Is this good Logick <hi>Edward?</hi>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:31720:12"/>
If Christ be in the male, and in the female, may he
speake in the male, but not in the female? Doth not
the Apostle say; the man is not without the woman, nor
the woman without the man, but both in the Lord?
And if the woman be in the Lord as well as the man,
may not the Lord speak in her? Art thou one of them
that wilt limit the Holy one? What if he speake in a
dumb Asse, and reprove the madnesse of the Prophet
<hi>Balaam?</hi> And if hee should doe so now, to reprove the
mad Prophets that are in <hi>Balaams</hi> way, loving the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of unrighteousnesse now, as he did then? will you
reprove God? He that reproves him shall answer it; and
he that gainsayes either Son or Daughter, shall perish in
the gain-saying. And now I come to thy third Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="observation">
               <head>The third Observation.</head>
               <p>THy eye being evill, thou canst not see when good
cometh; and thou art one of them who watcheth
for iniquity, that thereby thou mayest blaspheme the
Name of God and his Truth, which thou art out of.
And as for our Tenets, which thou saith thou hast na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
and shamed; thou no more knows us, nor our Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,
then thou knowest from whence the winde comes,
and whither it goes: For all our words are as a parable
to thee, and thou knowest not what we say, although
thou hast catched and snatched up some of our words
brokenly to quarrell with; yet we are hidden from thee,
and a gulfe is between thee and us, that as thou canst
not apprehend nor comprehend; but first a terrible day
must come upon thee, and those things which thou hast
laid down to be our Tenets, thou doubtest whether they
be or no, manifest by thy owne words. If we say so, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:31720:13"/>
if we hold so, thou had better have been certain before
thou hadst shewed thy selfe too imperious and arrogant,
of sham<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ng them, when thou knowest not whether we
hold them, as thou hast layd them downe in thy owne
words, the shame at last will come upon thy selfe; and
that rash, hasty, raging spirit, by which thou utterest forth
all this mudd and dirt, every one may see in this observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thy deceit manifest.</p>
               <p>And the first thing that thy darke minde stumbles at
is, that some have said, <hi>That they that have the spirit of God
are equall with God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He that hath the Spirit of God, is in that which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall,
as God is equall, and his wayes equall; And he
that is joyned to the Lord is one sprit, there is unity,
and the unity stands in equality it selfe.</p>
               <p>He that is borne from above is the Sonne of God, and
he said, <hi>I and my Father are one.</hi> And when the Sonne
is revealed, and speaks, the Father speaks in him, and
dwells in him, and he in the Father. In that which is
equall in equality it selfe; there is equality in nature,
though not in stature. Goe learn what these things mean,
the understanding and learned will know what I say, and
this is neither damnable nor blasphemous; but on the
contrary, it is saving and precious to them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And thou concludes,</hi> Though they be glorified in heaven, yet
are not equall with God.</p>
               <p>Here thou blasphemes; the Son is glorified with the
Father in the same glory he had with him before the
world began; the glory is in purity, equality, immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,
and eternity; but for thy proof thou bringst <hi>Psal.
86 8. For who among the gods is like unto our God</hi> And
again, <hi>There is none like unto thee, O Lord.</hi> Here thou
hast gone about to prove more Gods then one in heaven:
Were the gods glorified in heaven, which were not like
the living God? Or were they in heaven, which were
not like the Lord? What blasphemy is this? They that
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:31720:13"/>
are in heaven are like him in his image, and not like a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other; but in the world there are gods many, and
Lords many, but that is not in heaven: There are no
Gods nor Lords in the World, nor in the Earth, that is
like the living God and living Lord of Heaven and Earth;
And many such nonsensicall phrases hast thou uttered,
and foolish impertinencies; and thou hast scarce cited
one Scripture, but thou hast either misapplyed, or wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted,
and perverted, being very ignorant and unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and thy Masters for whom thou contendst, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
receive much honour nor credit by thy writing, or
vindication of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But to the second Particular, which thou calls our
Tenet, is,</hi> That Christ Jesus is not glorified in his humane
nature, and that he hath no reall body, but his mysticall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
<hi>and this thou sayest</hi> is contrary to Scripture, <hi>Luke 24.
3. 9. and</hi> Acts 3. 20. <hi>John. 17.</hi> And in this thou sayest, <hi>we
are shamed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I say thou hast shamed thy selfe, and hath cited these
Scriptures to no purpose at all, none of all these speaks
of humane nature, or mysticall body; but this I say, he
is glorified with the Father in a spirituall body, in the
same glory he had with the Father before the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan.
And the same Jesus which was of the seed of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
according to the flesh, and the Sonne of God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the spirit, is glorified with the Father, the
man Christ Jesus, he is set downe at the right hand of
God; But if thou meane by humane, a carnall body,
or the same flesh that thou hast on; deal plainly with us,
and nakedly, the next time thou or any of thy Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
writes, and prove us by Scripture where the
Church is called his mysticall body; or where hast thou
got these new coyned words, as Humane nature, and
mysticall body? Correct thy pen, and let no such Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
phrases come in print again, least thou shame thy
selfe more, instead of shaming of us: And thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes,
<hi>If any say here he is, or there he is on earth, believe
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:31720:14"/>
them not.</hi> Where learnedst thou this Article of Faith, I
pray thee shew me? Is he not both in heaven and earth?
How should he restore the earth and all things into their
purity, if he must not be manifest in the earth? What,
wilt thou confine him to, or in a place? Doth not his
presence fill heaven and earth? Is he divided from his
presence?</p>
               <p>But may be thou wilt say as thy generation doth, that
<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e is in the Earth by his spirit, and in Heaven in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
or person, distinct from his spirit. If so, then you
divide Christ, and a person without a spirit, and not
Christ. I will aske thee a question; No man hath ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
up to heaven, but he that came downe from heaven,
the Sonne of man which is in heaven. Where was the
Sonne of man, or the man Christ when this was
spoken?</p>
               <p>If thou canst see this, thou mayst be ashamed to shut
Christ out of the Earth, or from among his Saints,
where his presence, his arme, his hand and his power
is, which is not divided from his body; but I know thou
art deafe, and canst not heare what I say, and thou
bringst <hi>Heb. 10. 12. After he had offered one sacrifice, sate
downe at the right hand of God;</hi> that is sayst thou, <hi>In his
humane nature.</hi> The shame is come upon thy selfe, who
have added thy owne imagination; and let all see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Scripture speak of humane nature; but thy folly
must be manifest to all.</p>
               <p>Thy third Particular that thou names, and as thou
sayest shames, is, <hi>If wee say wee are without sinne, we deceive
our selves.</hi> Thou hadst better have enquired perfectly
whether we said so or no, before thou hadst undertook to
reprove upon so doubtfull termes, and thou bringst <hi>Prov.
20. 9. For who can say my heart is clean.</hi> He can say so,
and speaks truth, whose heart God hath cleansed by the
blood of Christ from all sinne: And then thou bringst
<hi>Job 9. 20. If I justifie my selfe, my owne mouth shall condemn me.</hi>
That's true, we justifie not our selves, neither
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:31720:14"/>
selfe; but denies selfe, and selfe is condemned, and
Christ, Gods righteousnesse is become our Justification.
And then thou bringest <hi>Paul,</hi> Phil. 3. <hi>Not as though I had
already attained, but follow after, that I may apprehend.</hi>
What of that, he was in his growth, and was come to that
which was perfect, and did believe to attain to the stature
of a perfect man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And then thou saith,</hi> I tell you, you are not perfect, your
contempt of the Ministers of Christ, and perverting the Doctrine
of Christ are Characters of sin.</p>
               <p>That shall stand for thy selfe, and thy Masters whom
thou art joyned with, who sets up Popish trumpery in
stead of the Ordinance of Christ; and sets up the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
of men, introduced in the apostacy, for the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Christ: And then thou concludes, the Scripture
hath concluded all under sinne, all in the first <hi>Adam;</hi>
but I hope the Scripture doth not conclude all under sin
in the second <hi>Adam:</hi> Neither doth conclude him under
sinne that's borne of God, who sins not. And if thou
make any such conclusion, thou gives thy verdict for the
Devill, and not for God: then thou saith, <hi>I am not
pleading for sinne.</hi> Thou art pleading for nothing else
but for sinne and imperfection, in which the Devils king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
stands; and thou saith, thou hast cause to cry out,
<hi>O wretched man that I am!</hi> So thou hast indeed; hast thou
repented of thy drunkennesse? How long is it since thou
fell off a bridge, being drunke, and broke thy leg; but
it is like, for thy good service done to thy Master, in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
this lying scrole, he will give thee an absolution for
that transgression.</p>
               <p>The fourth Particular which thou calls our Tenet, is,
<hi>That we deny the Scripture to be the Word of God;</hi> And
thou hast brought many Scriptures to prove that they
are; but they are as impertinent to the thing as thy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
about the Steeple-house, or Masse-house. Thou hast
brought many Scriptures, <hi>Jer. 37. 8.</hi> how they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the words of the Lord, who ever denyed that? but
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:31720:15"/>
the Word spoke the words, and the Word is greater.
<hi>2 Tim. 3. 16 All Scripture is given by divine inspiration.</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that, some was spoken by the Devill, and some by
wicked men, and I hope thou wilt not call that divine
inspiration. Then thou may be wilt conclude, I deny
the words of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy.</hi> I deny the word <hi>Is,</hi> it is
an addition of the Translator, which word alters and
varies the true sense of that Scripture; but all Scripture
given by inspiration of God is profitable for doctrine,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> But knowest thou no distinction between inspiration
and tradition? You have it by tradition, the Saints by
Inspiration. It's a dead letter in it selfe, and as it is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from your mouthes, who speak of it by tradition;
but from them that were inspired, the living Spirit ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
forth living words; But what is all this to prove
the Scripture or writings to be the Word of God. And
then thou cites 2 <hi>Cor. 4. 7. Not handling the Word deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</hi>
What doth this prove? nothing at all; and all
the rest that thou hast cited is nothing at all but what we
have answered over and over many times, wherein all
that have any understanding in the knowledge of God
are satisfied: That which thou shouldst have proved by
the Scripture, is, where the Scripture, or writings, or
Letter doth title it selfe the Word of God. It is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
they are the words of God, and the words of holy
men inspired: So in thy owne words, I say, take thou
notice, though thou art confident and presumptuous,
in this thou hast shamed thy selfe, and not us. The Word
was before either Scripture, Writings, or Bible was;
which Word is greater, and gave them a being: And
thou that wouldst set that which is brought forth by the
Father, above the Father, art out of the Apostles wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
speaking a similitude; He that builds a house,
receives more honour then the house. Now to call the
Scripture the Word, is to give as much honour to the
house, as to him that builded it; but in a word, this I
say, what ever the Scripture doth testifie of it selfe, or
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:31720:15"/>
call it selfe, that I owne it to be: And if any man call
it another thing, it shall testifie against him; and so thou
that hast gone about to set up the words which were spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in time, above or equall with the Word, that was
before all time, art ignorant, and unskilfull in the
knowledge of GOD, and silence would better become
thee.</p>

which the Merchants trade, and the Beast and all the
false Prophets, Deceivers and Antichrists, which have
all had their rise since the Ascension of Christ, we would
have these be all shut in the pit again; and we would have
the Lamb to reigne, and the everlasting Gospell to be
preached again, the power of God; and we would have
the Earth restor'd, and we would have everlasting righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse
to reigne in the hearts of people, and Lawes, as
at the first, and Counsellors as in the beginning, who
iudge not for rewards; and Ministers, such as were in the
Primitive times, who will preach without tythes, hire,
and set wages, and without the Popes maintenance. If
thou canst receive these things, I will shew thee further it
may be hereafter, if I heare any more from thee. And we
are the men that are raysed up for the worke, to declare
against pride in the ground, and also in appearance, as
against <hi>Lace, Cuffs</hi> and <hi>Ribbons;</hi> And thou askes, if there
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:31720:16"/>
be nothing else: Hast thou denyed these, and the spirit
that leads to the abuse of Gods creatures? when thou hast,
I will sh<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>w unto thee there is something else to be done;
but if thou doe not obey that which is manifest, why
wouldst thou know more to adde to thy condemnation:
And we do not say, that casting off these things is all that
is required to salvation, thou bids us declare if there be
any thing else; so I shall, so that thou hearken to it, and
receive it, else thy condemnation shall be greater then
if I had written nothing. Thou must repent of all thy
sinne, and turn from it, and know the judgement of
God for it, and deny thy selfe in every thing, and lay
downe thy life also, and take up his Crosse daily, and
be crucified to the world, and cease from all thy owne
words, actions and thoughts, and come to taste of death
before thou come to know him to live in thee to be thy
salvation; canst thou do this? when thou witnesseth this
done, then thou shalt know further what God requires;
but a terrible day will come upon thee before these things
be fulfilled in thee; though thou be more stout then
thy fellowes, I know him who is able to break thy horn
which thou hast exalted against the Lamb of God and his
followers.</p>
               <p>And for thy exhortation, <hi>Not to seed on husks,</hi> take it
home to thy selfe, for thou hast nothing else to feed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
the words of the Saints at best, without the life, or
else some innovated invented trumpery of the Whore, of
whose Cup thou hast drunke, makes thee speak forth
all these venomous words against the life and power of
God in his people.</p>
               <p>And thou concludes, <hi>What thou hast written is as much for
our Conversion as Refutation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Both alike indeed, for thou hast done neither; but
hast conceived and brought forth winde, and spent thy
time for nought. Alas poor man, tellst thou of convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
who art not come out of the grosse pollutions of the
world? who art not ceased from drunkennesse? and art
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:31720:16"/>
pleading for Masse-houses, Tythes, Hirelings, and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
inventions, and art offended; we should declare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Ribbons, Cuffs, and Lace; what shouldst thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
any too, except to make them two-fold more chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of the Devill? And what shouldst thou refute or
confute? Wilt thou say one shall not steal, and dost thou?
Wilt thou say one should not be drunk, and art thou?
And wilt thou say one should forsake all sin, and yet say
none must be cleansed from it, but be alwayes miserable
men, and wretched men? Be first convinced in thy self
and turne from thy evill deeds, before <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>

more of converting or refuting any; For <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>
when all shall be set in order before thee what thou hast
done, and thou shalt receive according to thy work; and
thou shalt then see this worke to be for condemnation,
which thou hast published against the truth, which shall
and must abide for ever; and they that are in it, and walk
in it shall be everlastingly happy, and shall reigne as Kings
and Priests unto God for ever; and over all deceit, and
shall live to confound all the children of falshood in all
their devices.</p>
