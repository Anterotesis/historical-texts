            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <bibl>
                     <hi>MATT.</hi> x. 42.</bibl>
                  <p>Whosoever shall give to drink unto One of these Little Ones, a Cup of Cold Water only, in the Name of a Disciple; Verily I say unto you, He shall in no wise lose his Reward.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>OUR Blessed Saviour having spent the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Part of this <hi>Chapter</hi> in declaring to his Disciples what <hi>Troubles,</hi> and <hi>Persecutions,</hi> they should undergo for his Sake; takes Occasion from thence, in the <hi>Verses</hi> before the <hi>Text,</hi> to shew, how we ought to behave Our selves towards Those who should fall into any <hi>Sufferings</hi> upon such an Account; and how Great the <hi>Reward</hi> of our so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing should be. <hi>He that receiveth you,</hi> says he, <hi>receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Me; and He that receiveth Me, receiveth Him that sent Me. He that receiveth a Prophet, in the Name of a Prophet, shall receive a Prophets Reward. And He that receiveth a Righteous-man, in the Name of a Righteous-Man, shall receive a Righteous Man's Reward. And, Whosoever shall give to drink unto One of these little Ones, a Cup of cold water only, in the Name of a Disciple; Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily I say unto you, He shall in no wise lose his Reward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall not trouble you with any nice Enquiry into the <hi>distinction</hi> which our <hi>Saviour,</hi> in these words, makes of Those whom he therein recommends to our <hi>Charity,</hi> and <hi>Entertainment.</hi> Three sorts of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:101923:3"/>
he manifestly refers to in them, and speaks of <hi>Those</hi> in the <hi>Text,</hi> as the <hi>least,</hi> and <hi>meanest,</hi> of them All. And yet even of These He tells Us, that <hi>Whosoever</hi> should give but <hi>a Cup of Cold water to drink,</hi> to One such Christian, <hi>in the name of a Disciple</hi>; that is, should shew the least regard to him upon this account, That He <hi>belongs to Christ; He should in no wise lose his Reward</hi>; i. e. He should be <hi>very highly Rewarded by God</hi> for it.</p>
            <p>Now this being the <hi>Occasion,</hi> and <hi>Import</hi> of these <hi>Words,</hi> I shall with Relation to both, proceed <hi>to discourse upon them, in this following Method</hi>;</p>
            <p n="1">I. I will shew you, That those who <hi>Profess</hi> the <hi>Gospel</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> must expect oftentimes to meet with <hi>Tryals,</hi> and <hi>Persecutions,</hi> from <hi>Wicked Men,</hi> upon the account of it.</p>
            <p n="2">II. That it is the <hi>Duty</hi> of every <hi>Good Christian,</hi> according to his Ability, to <hi>assist</hi> and <hi>support</hi> those who <hi>suffer</hi> upon <hi>such an Account.</hi> And,</p>
            <p n="3">III. That whatsoever <hi>Charity</hi> we shall exercise towards such <hi>Persons,</hi> upon the account of their <hi>Sufferings,</hi> it shall turn to our great <hi>Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage</hi> in the <hi>other World</hi>; where We shall be, in a singular manner, Rewarded by God for it.</p>
            <p>I shall speak, but very briefly, to each of these Points; and so proceed to that <hi>Application</hi> of them, which the present Occasion requires of Me. And,</p>
            <p n="1">I. That those who <hi>Profess</hi> the <hi>Gospel of Christ,</hi> must expect oftentimes to meet with <hi>Tryals</hi> and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101923:3"/>
               <hi>Persecutions,</hi> from <hi>Wicked Men,</hi> upon the account of it.</p>
            <p>This was what our <hi>Saviour</hi> expresly declared to his <hi>Disciples</hi> in this <hi>Chapter</hi>; and their <hi>own Experience</hi> sufficiently convinced them of the <hi>Truth</hi> of his <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we look back to the <hi>first State</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> before the Conversion of the <hi>Empire</hi> to <hi>Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>; what are all its <hi>Histories</hi> but the <hi>Records</hi> of those <hi>Tryals</hi> which its most eminent Professors under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went for the sake of it? What <hi>Torments</hi> they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured; what <hi>Oppositions</hi> they met with; and by what <hi>Deaths</hi> they <hi>perfected</hi> all their other Sufferings? When, in the Language of our <hi>Apostle, Every one who would live Godly in Christ Jesus,</hi> was sure to <hi>suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer persecution.</hi> Their <hi>Religion</hi> was their <hi>Crime:</hi> and there was no choice left them but to <hi>renounce</hi> it, or to resolve to <hi>suffer</hi>; it may be, to <hi>Die,</hi> for it.</p>
            <p>Nor did the <hi>Case</hi> become much better afterwards. 'Tis true, the <hi>Pretence</hi> of the <hi>Persecution</hi> was alter'd: Men did not any longer suffer for the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> as they had done before. But the <hi>truth</hi> of the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel</hi> was still <hi>persecuted,</hi> tho' under another <hi>Character:</hi> And the <hi>Sufferings</hi> which <hi>Christians</hi> have brought on their fellow <hi>Christians,</hi> have not been at all <hi>less,</hi> than what had been inflicted upon them by their <hi>Common Enemies</hi> heretofore.</p>
            <p>It is indeed a most astonishing thing to consider to what a strange <hi>degeneracy</hi> the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Christianity</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:101923:4"/>
has fallen in this particular. That a <hi>Religion</hi> found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> and which breaths out no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than <hi>Kindness,</hi> and <hi>Gentleness,</hi> in all its Precepts; should yet have become the Occasion of more <hi>Cruelty,</hi> and <hi>Barbarity,</hi> than ever any <hi>Religion</hi> in the World, besides, had been. But that which is yet more <hi>Amazing,</hi> as well as more <hi>deplorable,</hi> is; that Men should make it a matter of <hi>Conscience</hi> to the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> of such a <hi>Religion,</hi> to <hi>persecute</hi> One another: And think that they <hi>do God Service,</hi> when they <hi>Dye</hi> their <hi>hands</hi> with the <hi>bloud</hi> of His <hi>Servants.</hi> Yet to this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of <hi>Fury</hi> have some <hi>Christians,</hi> in these later Ages, arrived: And have thereby given Us but too just a Ground, still to continue the Assertion I have laid down; That those who will <hi>profess</hi> the <hi>Gospel</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> in the <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Purity</hi> of it, must expect, even in <hi>Christian Countries,</hi> to fall oftentimes under the <hi>severest Tryals,</hi> for the sake of it.</p>
            <p>How this <hi>barbarous,</hi> and <hi>bloudy Spirit,</hi> first got ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission into the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> I shall not now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. Certain it is, that as there is nothing more <hi>Vnreasonable,</hi> in the nature of the thing its self, than to <hi>force Conscience,</hi> and to <hi>persecute</hi> men into a <hi>right faith</hi>; So is there nothing more contrary to all the <hi>Rules</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> than to propagate its interests by <hi>Violence,</hi> and <hi>Oppression.</hi> This the <hi>Primitive Christians,</hi> constantly objected to their <hi>Heathen Enemies.</hi> This all the <hi>Best,</hi> and <hi>Wisest Men,</hi> have generally asserted ever since: And, even the most <hi>Perverse,</hi> see the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101923:4"/>
               <hi>Reasonableness</hi> of it, when it comes to be their <hi>own Case</hi>; and they are themselves in danger of <hi>Suffering</hi> upon <hi>this Account.</hi> And yet such is the strange par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality of <hi>Mankind,</hi> that we hardly any of us know how to set bounds to this <hi>Temper,</hi> when we have the <hi>Power</hi> in our Hands. We think we have <hi>all a Right</hi> to <hi>persecute Others,</hi> tho' none have any to return it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Our selves.</hi> And accordingly, we do all, in our several turns, both <hi>Rail</hi> at <hi>Persecution</hi> in <hi>Matters</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> and yet continue to <hi>set</hi> up for it.</p>
            <p>But as this Temper has always been observed to prevail most on the <hi>Worst Side</hi>; (which is generally found to make up with <hi>Violence,</hi> what it wants in <hi>Argument:)</hi> So of all kinds of <hi>Christians</hi> never have any been more scandalously guilty of this <hi>Barbarity</hi> than those of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi>; that <hi>dishonour</hi> to the <hi>Name,</hi> and <hi>Scourge</hi> to the <hi>Disciples</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi> Whose <hi>Religion</hi> as it has a Great Allay of <hi>Paganism,</hi> in it; so we ought the less to wonder if we see it wholly acted by a <hi>Pagan Spirit.</hi> And of the <hi>Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> whereof I shall, at present, say no more than this; that had we no other Ground than this to <hi>reject</hi> it, even this alone would be enough to warrant us in our disowning of it; that she has <hi>Glutted</hi> her self with the <hi>Bloud</hi> of the <hi>best-Christians,</hi> and still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues to <hi>thirst</hi> for <hi>more:</hi> And openly avows that, Principle, which I am now speaking against, as <hi>Cruel</hi> and <hi>Anti-Christian; that Religion is to be propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated, and maintain'd by the Sword.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:101923:5"/>I shall not here enter on any particular Relation of those <hi>Persecutions,</hi> with which that <hi>Church</hi> has fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Histories</hi> of the whole World, for some <hi>Ages</hi> past: And of which not only <hi>Europe,</hi> but <hi>Asia,</hi> and <hi>America; Infidels,</hi> as well as <hi>Christians,</hi> have been the <hi>Spectators.</hi> Blessed be God! neither her <hi>Cruelties,</hi> nor her <hi>Corruptions,</hi> are unknown to any of Us. It shall suffice to say, that as our <hi>Saviour Christ</hi> from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning knew what would happen to his <hi>Church</hi> to the very end of the World; and foresaw as well, what the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> in these latter <hi>Ages</hi> should do to it, as what the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Heathens</hi> were at the beginning to bring upon it; so we must conclude, that in this <hi>Chapter,</hi> he referr'd indifferently to both: And designed no less to <hi>fortifie,</hi> and <hi>instruct us of these Times,</hi> how to behave our selves under the <hi>Persecutions</hi> of <hi>Popery</hi>; than to direct his <hi>Apostles,</hi> and <hi>Primitive Disciples,</hi> how it would behove them to manage themselves, with relation to the <hi>Heathen,</hi> and <hi>Jewish, Cruelty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let this then be our first Conclusion, founded on the <hi>foreknowledge</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the <hi>Corruption</hi> of <hi>Humane Nature</hi>; which hitherto we are sure has been, and we h<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ve Reason to fear, will always continue to be but too true; <hi>viz.</hi> That those who profess the <hi>Truth</hi> of <hi>Christianity,</hi> and will hold fast to the <hi>purity</hi> of it; must expect to meet with many <hi>Tryals,</hi> and <hi>Persecutions</hi> from wicked Men, upon the account of it.

               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:101923:5"/>II. To shew; That it is the duty of Every <hi>Good Christian,</hi> according to his Ability, to <hi>assist</hi> and <hi>support</hi> those, who suffer on such an Account.</p>
            <p>And that whether we consider them (1<hi>st.</hi>) Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>common Character of Christians.</hi> Or (2<hi>dly)</hi> under the more <hi>particular Circumstance, Of suffering for Righteousness sake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">(1<hi>st)</hi> If we consider Them under the <hi>Common Character</hi> of <hi>Christians</hi>; Even this alone will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige Us not only to <hi>minister</hi> to their <hi>Wants,</hi> but to do it with a singular <hi>desire,</hi> and <hi>affection</hi> of <hi>Mind</hi> towards Them. God who has commanded Us to <hi>Do Good unto All Men</hi>;<note place="margin">Gal. vi. 10.</note> has also commanded us to <hi>Do</hi> it, in a more especial manner, to <hi>Those who are of the Houshold of Faith.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. ixli. 1. 1 Pet. i. 22 1 Jo. iii. 16·</note> There is a <hi>Brotherly Love</hi> required of Us by <hi>Christ,</hi> towards <hi>One Another,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what we are obliged to have for the <hi>rest</hi> of <hi>Mankind:</hi> and which ought to dispose Us not only to a more tender <hi>sense</hi> of, and <hi>compassion,</hi> for their <hi>Needs</hi>; but, with that, to a more <hi>bountiful supply</hi> of them.<note place="margin">Mat. v. 44.</note> So that tho' a <hi>Christian</hi> must <hi>Love</hi> his very <hi>Enemy</hi>; and <hi>Do Good</hi> to those who <hi>despitefully Vse him, and persecute him</hi>; yet he must remember, that there is a difference to be made by him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a <hi>Brother</hi> and an <hi>Enemy</hi>; and he must as much <hi>love,</hi> and do <hi>Good</hi> to the <hi>One,</hi> above the <hi>Other,</hi> as he is more <hi>nearly related</hi> to the <hi>One,</hi> than to the <hi>Other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:101923:6"/>But this is the least part of our <hi>Obligation</hi> in the Case before Us: Which as it supposes the <hi>Suffering</hi> to be for the sake of <hi>Christ's Religion,</hi> So will it,</p>
            <p n="2">(2<hi>dly)</hi> Oblige us, in a more particular man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to <hi>Relieve</hi> those, who fall into their <hi>distresses</hi> upon such an account.</p>
            <p>In such Circumstances as these, not to <hi>Assist</hi> our <hi>Brethren,</hi> is to <hi>deny</hi> our <hi>Faith:</hi> And the <hi>neglect</hi> we put upon Them, will fall not so much upon <hi>Them,</hi> as upon <hi>Him</hi> whose <hi>Disciples</hi> they are, and <hi>for whose Sake</hi> they suffer.</p>
            <p>Hence we may observe, in all the antient <hi>Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> with what an Officious dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence the Other Christians still attended upon their <hi>Martyrs</hi> and <hi>Confessors.</hi> How they ministred to them in their <hi>Prisons,</hi> and <hi>Bonds:</hi> Went with them to their <hi>Judgments</hi>; and would not <hi>leave</hi> them at their very <hi>Sufferings.</hi> With what <hi>Zeal,</hi> and <hi>Readiness,</hi> they furnish'd them with such things as they stood in need of: How they <hi>Encouraged</hi> them in their <hi>Conflicts</hi>; and shew'd their earnest desire to <hi>partake</hi> with them in their <hi>Sufferings,</hi> as they did in the <hi>Cause</hi> for which They <hi>suffered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus they <hi>Confess'd Christ,</hi> by Owning of those who were <hi>Persecuted</hi> for their <hi>Confession</hi> of Him: And thus ought every Good Christian to Confess him still. In a <hi>publick War,</hi> if any One part of a <hi>Country</hi> be destroy'd, it is but an Act of <hi>Justice</hi> for the rest, to bear their share in the loss; and, to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101923:6"/>
contribute towards the Repair of the damage that was sustain'd by it. The Case is, in reality, the same here. We are all <hi>Members</hi> of the same <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Catholic, Church of Christ.</hi> If <hi>Persecution</hi> for the <hi>Faith</hi> arises, which part soever <hi>suffers,</hi> 'tis the <hi>Church</hi> that is <hi>persecuted.</hi> And we ought to account our selves concern'd to bear our Share in the <hi>Evils</hi> which our Fellow-Christians Undergo, for the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Cause</hi> of the <hi>Gospel</hi>; as We hope to be one day made partakers with them, in the <hi>Promises</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>Here therefore is a duty, which not only <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Charity,</hi> but even <hi>Common-Justice,</hi> and <hi>Equity,</hi> oblige us unto. In this Case, to <hi>desert</hi> our <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> is to <hi>betray</hi> our <hi>Faith</hi>; And we shall, in effect, <hi>Renounce</hi> the <hi>Cause</hi> for which they <hi>suffer,</hi> if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to <hi>partake</hi> with them in their <hi>Sufferings.</hi> But to <hi>Own</hi> and to <hi>Receive</hi> them; to <hi>Cherish,</hi> and <hi>Relieve</hi> them; and that as <hi>suffering</hi> for the <hi>Cause</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi>; this is openly to joyn with them in their <hi>Confession:</hi> And, as our <hi>Saviour</hi> here assures us, if we do <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate</hi> with them in their <hi>Afflictions,</hi> we shall also be made partakers with them of their <hi>Reward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which brings Me to the last <hi>Point</hi> I proposed to speak to;</p>
            <p n="3">III. That whatsoever <hi>Charity</hi> we shall exercise to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards such <hi>Persons,</hi> upon the account of their <hi>Sufferings</hi>; it shall turn to our <hi>great Advantage</hi> in the Other World; where we shall be, in a <hi>Singular Manner, Rewarded by God</hi> for it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:101923:7"/>There is hardly any <hi>Virtue</hi> prescribed to Us in the <hi>Gospel,</hi> to the <hi>Practice</hi> whereof so many <hi>Promises</hi> have been made by God, as to this of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi> In the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> it pleased God to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the <hi>Jews</hi> to a liberal Exercise of it, by the Hope of a <hi>present Retribution</hi> that should be made to Them for it. And tho' under the <hi>Gospel,</hi> such <hi>Promises</hi> as these are not to be expected; yet has our <hi>Saviour Christ</hi> assured Us, that a <hi>plentiful Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> shall be laid up for Us in <hi>Heaven,</hi> to reward <hi>every</hi> Act of <hi>Charity</hi> that We perform here upon <hi>Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An Eminent Argument whereof we meet with in the account which He has given Us of the <hi>last Judgment:</hi> And in which He seems to make the whole Issue of our <hi>Acquittal,</hi> or <hi>Condemnation,</hi> in a manner, to depend upon it. For having told us how he will then divide the <hi>Sheep from the Goats; and set the one on his Right Hand, and the other on his Left:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matt. xxv. 32, 33.</note> He thus delivers the <hi>Sentence</hi> which He will pass on both.<note place="margin">—34:</note> He will say to those on his <hi>Right Hand; Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, prepared for you from the beginning of the World. For I was an Hungry and ye gave me Meat</hi>;<note place="margin">—35:</note> 
               <hi>Naked and ye Cloathed me; Sick and in Prison, and ye Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred unto me.</hi>
               <note place="margin">—41.</note> But he will say to those on his Left Hand; <hi>Depart ye Cursed into Everlasting Fire, prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the Devil,</hi>
               <note place="margin">—42.</note> 
               <hi>and his Angels. For I was an Hungry, and ye Fed me not; Naked and ye Cloathed me not; Sick
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:101923:7"/>
and in Prison, and ye Ministred not unto Me.</hi> These are the Sentences, which our <hi>Saviour Christ</hi> will pronounce, upon the <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Bad</hi> at the <hi>last Day.</hi> And from which if we may not generally conclude, that Our <hi>Charity</hi> is the <hi>only</hi> Thing that shall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after be Enquired into, and and be either <hi>Rewarded,</hi> or <hi>Punished</hi> for ever; yet thus much we may cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly infer, that it is one of the main Things by which <hi>Our Piety</hi> shall <hi>be judged</hi> of: And that he who has a true <hi>Love</hi> for his <hi>Neighbour,</hi> and is upon all Occasions ready to <hi>do</hi> all the <hi>Good</hi> he can for him, shall hardly fail of being <hi>Accepted</hi> by <hi>God,</hi> as he will be sure to be generally <hi>beloved</hi> of <hi>Men,</hi> for his <hi>Beneficence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it is not only our <hi>Charity</hi> that shall entitle Us to a <hi>Reward,</hi> in the present Case; tho' even that alone would be Sufficient, to make Good the <hi>Promise</hi> of the <hi>Text</hi> to Us. He who Relieves a <hi>Persecuted Christian,</hi> in the <hi>Name</hi> of a <hi>Disciple</hi>; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he belongs to <hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>suffers</hi> for his <hi>Sake</hi>; shall be considered by God, not only for his <hi>Charity</hi> towards his <hi>Neighbour,</hi> but for his <hi>Confession</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> too: And have a part in <hi>the Reward,</hi> which the Other is to Receive upon the account of such his <hi>Persecution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this at once both <hi>ascertains,</hi> and <hi>encreases</hi> the Retribution of such a <hi>Charity.</hi> It renders it both more <hi>Excellent</hi> in its self, and more <hi>Acceptable</hi> unto <hi>God:</hi> Who as he will, in the first place, <hi>Reward</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:101923:8"/>
those who <hi>Suffer</hi> for his sake; so will he in the Next, Consider <hi>Those</hi> who <hi>Own</hi> them in their <hi>Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> and extend their <hi>pious Beneficence</hi> to them, upon the account of them.</p>
            <p>Hence we may observe, with what Extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Circumstances,</hi> our <hi>Saviour Christ</hi> delivers the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of the <hi>Text</hi> to this purpose. The <hi>Person</hi> of whom he speaks, is One of the <hi>least</hi> of his <hi>Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi>; the meanest of any that should be called to <hi>suffer</hi> for his sake. The <hi>Charity,</hi> in which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, is the poorest of all <hi>Charities:</hi> A <hi>Cup of Cold Water</hi>; Such as the most indigent person is able to Give, and hardly any can be so far Reduced, as to stand in need of it. And yet even this <hi>little, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible act of Charity,</hi> if done to one of the <hi>mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est</hi> of <hi>Christ's Disciples</hi>; in the <hi>Name of a Disciple,</hi> shall <hi>not lose its Reward.</hi> So acceptable a thing is it to God to <hi>Confess</hi> him, in any Way, <hi>before Men!</hi> And so certainly shall he who do's it, be <hi>Gloriously Rewarded</hi> by him to all <hi>Eternity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here then let us stop; and from the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Consideration of the <hi>duty proposed,</hi> and of the Great <hi>Reward</hi> which it has pleased <hi>God</hi> to <hi>promise</hi> to the faithful discharge of it; proceed to that <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication</hi> which his <hi>Providence</hi> has call'd Us, at this time, to make of it. In pursuance whereof, if the <hi>Principles</hi> already laid down be admitted, as the true measure both of our <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Interest,</hi> in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; then I shall need only to shew, that you
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:101923:8"/>
have here a proper Occasion presented to you, to <hi>practice</hi> the <hi>One,</hi> and to <hi>advance</hi> the <hi>Other.</hi> And that I shall do in this following method.</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>st.</hi> I will shew, That the <hi>Persons</hi> here <hi>Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended</hi> to your <hi>Charity,</hi> are indeed the <hi>Disciples</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> That they <hi>do suffer</hi> for Righteousness sake. And therefore,</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly.</hi> Ought to be <hi>Considered,</hi> and <hi>Relieved</hi> by Us, upon the account of such their <hi>Sufferings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And 1<hi>st.</hi> That the <hi>Persons</hi> here Recommended to your <hi>Charity,</hi> are indeed the <hi>Disciples</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a Point that I should not have thought it needful to insist upon, had not the <hi>Calumnies</hi> of our Common <hi>Enemies</hi> obliged me to it. But since They have thought fit again to Revive the <hi>malicious Slaunders</hi> of their <hi>Ignorant,</hi> and <hi>Prejudiced Revilers</hi>;<note place="margin">Monsieur de <hi>Meaux</hi>'s Variations des Egl. Protestan. liv. xi.</note> and to set them off to the World with all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage that their <hi>Wit,</hi> and <hi>Language,</hi> enabled them to do; It is necessary in justice to these <hi>poor, perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted Christians,</hi> to place their <hi>History</hi> in its true light; and to express our <hi>Charity</hi> towards them, as well by <hi>Vindicating</hi> their <hi>Reputation,</hi> as by <hi>Ministring</hi> to their <hi>Needs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To take then this matter from the beginning: The <hi>Persons</hi> of whom we are now speaking, are a Portion of the <hi>Christians</hi> of the <hi>Evangelical Churches</hi> of <hi>Piemont.</hi> The <hi>common Name</hi> by which they are
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101923:9"/>
most known, is that of <hi>Vaudois,</hi> or <hi>Waldenses:</hi> So called not from <hi>Peter Waldo,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Leger. Hist. des Eglises E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangel. des Vallees de Piemont. liv. 1. cap. 2. Allix. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, chap. xix.</note> as has commonly been supposed; but from the place <hi>of their Habitation</hi>; the <hi>Valleys</hi> under the <hi>Alpes</hi>; within Three of which the <hi>Churches</hi> we are now speaking of were compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended.</p>
            <p>Who it was that first planted the <hi>Gospel</hi> in these Parts; or about what <hi>time</hi> it was done, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not certainly tell. But as our <hi>Religion</hi> was propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated in the very times of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> into the Other Parts of <hi>Italy</hi>; so is it most probable that it was, not long after, <hi>setled</hi> here too; tho' by what <hi>Evangelist,</hi> we are not able to determine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Christianity</hi> being thus brought into these Parts, and that, no doubt, in the same parity in which it was generally taught in those <hi>first Ages</hi>; continued in these <hi>Churches,</hi> as it did in <hi>Others,</hi> for some considerable time, if not free from <hi>All Corruption</hi>; yet at least, free from those <hi>dangerous Errors,</hi> which afterwards began to creep into the World. But about the <hi>Eigth Century,</hi> the business of <hi>Image-Worship,</hi> added to some Other more <hi>Early Superstitions</hi>; began to disturb the <hi>Peace</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and to <hi>Enflame</hi> the <hi>Zeal</hi> of the <hi>best Christians</hi> to the Opposing of it.</p>
            <p>Great was the Contention between the <hi>Eastern</hi> and <hi>Western Churches</hi> upon this Occasion: The One,<note place="margin">Vide Car. M. &amp; Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod.

            <p>From hence began an <hi>Open Schism</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Milan.</hi> The <hi>One part</hi> adhered to the <hi>Interests</hi> of <hi>Rome:</hi> The other, with their <hi>Arch-Bishop,</hi> stood up for their own <hi>Liberties</hi>; and the <hi>Rights</hi> of the <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy.</hi> And being for this deserted by the Rest, they communicated by themselves in a place called <hi>Pata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> and from thence were afterwards known by the Name of <hi>Patarines.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this Party, as that which had the Greatest Right on its side, the <hi>Churches</hi> of the <hi>Valleys</hi> joyn'd themselves.

               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:101923:11"/>Thus were these <hi>Churches</hi> both betimes <hi>Reform'd</hi>; and <hi>Settled,</hi> and <hi>Secured,</hi> in their <hi>pure Profession</hi> of the <hi>Gospel.</hi> It would be too long to relate, what great Good was done, by their means, to all the <hi>other Churches</hi> of <hi>Europe.</hi> What <hi>Colonies</hi> they sent out into <hi>France, Germany, England,</hi> and even into <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> its self; to propagate the <hi>Truth</hi> of the <hi>Gospel.</hi> From these <hi>Churches</hi> it was that our <hi>Wicleff</hi> derived his <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Knowledge.</hi> From these, the <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>Bohemia</hi> were establish'd.

            <p>I have before observed, that it was about the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the xi<hi>th Century,</hi> that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> usurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the <hi>Authority</hi> of that of <hi>Milan,</hi> occasion'd a <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration</hi>

            <p>What their Condition since that time has been, the Severe Proceedings of that Court against all the <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> of its Dominions, may suffice to tell Us.

            </p>
            <p>If (1<hi>st.</hi>) We consider either the <hi>Cause,</hi> or <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors</hi> of their <hi>Persecution</hi>; it will from both appear that we of the <hi>reform'd Religion</hi> must <hi>Support</hi> Them;
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:101923:15"/>
or they must be left to sink under their <hi>Afflictions:</hi> for We may be confident, that if we do not <hi>help</hi> them, No body else will.</p>
            <p>Were the Case here that of <hi>Christianity in General</hi>; Did these Poor Men suffer by the Hands of <hi>Turks,</hi> or <hi>Infidels</hi>; One might then hope that the <hi>Common Love,</hi> and <hi>Duty,</hi> we all profess to our <hi>Blessed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,</hi> and his <hi>Gospel,</hi> might move every <hi>Church,</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever differing in other Matters, yet to joyn toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for their <hi>Relief.</hi> But it is the misfortune those for whom we are now concern'd, that they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted not by the <hi>Common Enemy,</hi> but by those who are called by the <hi>same Name</hi> of <hi>Christians.</hi> They suffer, not for the <hi>defence</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> but for the maintenance of the <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Purity,</hi> of it; against those who have either <hi>mistaken,</hi> or <hi>perverted</hi> the <hi>Faith</hi> of it. And if We, who in this are <hi>agreed</hi> with <hi>Them,</hi> do not <hi>relieve</hi> them; with what Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son can we expect, that those whom they <hi>Oppose,</hi> and by whom they are <hi>Persecuted,</hi> should help Them?</p>
            <p>Here therefore is a Case, in which the <hi>Argument</hi> of the <hi>Text</hi> returns with a <hi>double force</hi> upon Us. These <hi>Persons</hi> are not only the <hi>Disciples</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi>; but of the same <hi>particular Faith</hi> and <hi>Communion</hi> with our selves. They are our <hi>Brethren</hi> not only as they are <hi>Christians,</hi> but as they are <hi>Reform'd too</hi>; and which is yet more, They <hi>suffer</hi> for being so. They might have <hi>believed</hi> in <hi>Christ,</hi> and yet have continued in
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:101923:15"/>
the peaceable Enjoyment of their <hi>Country,</hi> and <hi>Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions.</hi> But they could not have continued <hi>Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> without <hi>quitting</hi> them; and therefore they readily forsook both. And surely the least we can do to testify our concurrence with them in this <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,</hi> will be to extend our <hi>Charity</hi> towards them: And thereby to shew that We do own their <hi>Cause</hi>; and account it such, as deserves to be <hi>suffer'd</hi> for.</p>
            <p>But (2<hi>dly,</hi>) It is not only a <hi>Matter</hi> of <hi>Charity,</hi> but of <hi>Interest</hi> also to Us, to <hi>help,</hi> and <hi>relieve</hi> them: And that is an <hi>Argument,</hi> which where it is once <hi>received,</hi> seldom fails of <hi>prevailing</hi> with most Men.</p>
            <p>It cannot be unknown to any among Us, what <hi>Endeavours</hi> have been <hi>used,</hi> and what <hi>projects</hi> have been <hi>laid,</hi> for these last <hi>forty,</hi> or <hi>fifty</hi> Years, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly to root the <hi>Protestant Interest</hi> out of <hi>Europe.</hi> What Progress has been made by our Enemies to this purpose in <hi>Piemont, Hungary, Bohemia, France</hi>; shall I add, and here at Home too, both in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> is evident to all of Us. And had the design succeeded, as it was verily <hi>believed</hi> and <hi>hoped</hi> it would have done; I do not see what could have preserved the <hi>Reformed Religion</hi> from a <hi>general destruction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But blessed be God! Who in most of these places has disappointed their <hi>Designs:</hi> and we hope will, in the End, turn them, (as he has already in part
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:101923:16"/>
done) to their own <hi>Shame,</hi> and <hi>Confusion.</hi> And has effectually convinced us, how necessary it is for us to <hi>unite</hi> together in <hi>Interest</hi> and <hi>Affection,</hi> against our <hi>Common Enemies</hi>; if ever we mean to <hi>support</hi> our <hi>selves,</hi> and our <hi>Cause,</hi> from <hi>Ruine</hi>; by their <hi>unweari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Malice,</hi> and Indefatigable endeavours against Us.</p>
            <p>It is but a little time since we were called upon to receive those of the <hi>Reformed Church of France</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our Bosoms. By doing of this we have preserved so much of the <hi>Protestant Interest</hi> from sinking. And all that their <hi>Persecutors</hi> have gained by their Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties aginst them is but this, that they have forced them to <hi>change</hi> their <hi>Country</hi>; but have not at all lessened either their <hi>Zeal</hi> for their <hi>Religion,</hi> or their <hi>Ability</hi> to <hi>defend</hi> it.</p>
            <p>We are now invited to preserve the <hi>Remains</hi> of the same <hi>Church,</hi> and of some of those of the <hi>Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies</hi> of <hi>Piemont</hi> with Them. A <hi>Flock</hi> little in <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
               <note place="margin">About 11500. Persons.</note> but of <hi>Great Worth:</hi> And such as we cannot <hi>suffer</hi> to Perish, without fixing an <hi>Eternal Infamy</hi> upon our <hi>Names,</hi> for our <hi>Vncharitableness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whose turn it may next be to suffer in this <hi>Cause,</hi> we cannot tell. This we know, that be it whose it will, Our <hi>Charity</hi> will have its <hi>Reward</hi> with <hi>God</hi>; and give a Good <hi>Example,</hi> and <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement</hi> to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi> We may, by what we do for these poor, persecuted Men, <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long</hi> our <hi>Own Tranquility</hi>; and so meet with a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:101923:16"/>
on <hi>Earth.</hi> But though we should not; yet this we are sure, that we shall hereby purchase to our selves an <hi>Inheritance</hi> in <hi>Heaven.</hi> Our <hi>Vnrighteous Mamon,</hi> shall prepare for us an <hi>eternal Habitation.</hi> What we now give for the sake of Christ, and to his <hi>Disciples,</hi> in his <hi>Name</hi>; he will one Day return, as if we had done it unto <hi>Himself:</hi> And <hi>Verily I say unto you, ye shall in No wise lose the Reward of it.</hi>
