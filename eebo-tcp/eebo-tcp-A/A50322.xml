            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:30490:3"/>
the blame of ſome, as unable to do the Author, I have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, his full right, but rather by my rude ſtile wronging his original luſtre; yet perhaps, with others more moderate, I may find favor and good acceptance, as well for my choice of the Author, whoſe worth will ſomewhat beare me out, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have contributed hereunto what I ought, which can be no more then what I could. Mine Author was a Florentine, whoſe national attribute among the Italians is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty, and whoſe particular eminence in cunning hath ſtyled the moſt cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as his Sectaries, <hi>Machiavilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> Nor hath this workman taken in hand a work unproper for his skill, being the diſcovery of the firſt foundations, and analyzing of the very grounds upon which the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Commonwealth was built, and afterwards roſe to ſuch glory and power, that neither before nor after all the ages of the world
<pb facs="tcp:30490:3"/>
ever afforded the like example.</p>
            <p>This book I conceived, I might not unfitly preſent your Grace with, as unto whoſe ſervice I owe my ſelf and what I can, and whom as well for neereneſs of blood, as affection and favor, his Sacred Majeſty may moſt probably imploy in this our ſhip of State near the helme, to the end it may in ſome part ſerve for your experience, as a good ſea-card, whereby you may become able and expert, as well in the entrances and paſſages into all creeks and harbors of quiet, as in the diſcovery and avoidance of all rocks and ſhelves; for as at ſea it is alwaies ſeen, that in a ſtormy and tempeſtuous time, the maſter dares not truſt the rudder in the hand of others then ſuch as are the beſt approved and experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Mariners; ſo, in all States we find, that however in time of peace and quiet, allyance, blood, and favor have a main ſtroke in matter of preferments and imployments too
<pb facs="tcp:30490:4"/>
yet when the times grow perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with perils and difficulties, true worth and experience are ſought af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and then of value. No climate is ſo benigne, as to afford a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual calme, and therefore your Grace may do well to enable your ſelf for the ſervice of your Prince and Countrey, that being called for into the ſteerage in turbulent times, not favor, onely may give you a place there, but uſe find you neceſſary, whereunto if I could contribute a poore mite, I had done enough.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding however my Authour, in what he hath done well, hath far excelled others, yet is he not without his ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes and errors to; which, as well as I was able to diſcover them, I have markt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto added ſome obſervations, taking (as I think) all his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious errors in this book: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I may have committed faults too,

                     <p>WHoſoever ſhall reade what beginning the City of Rome had, who were the Lawmakers, and how it was founded, will nothing marvaile that ſo great vertue was continued ſo many years in the city, and that from thence afterwards there grew ſo mighty an Empire, to which that Commonwealth attain'd. And therefore to diſcourſe firſt of her birth, I ſay, that all Cities were built either by the Natives of the place they were built in, or by ſtrangers. The firſt comes to paſſe when the inhabitants being diſpers'd in many and ſmall numbers finde they cannot live ſafe, each one not
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:30490:16"/>
having ſtrength apart, as well by reaſon of their ſituation, as their ſmall number to reſiſt the violence of thoſe that would force them; or if they would joyn together for their defence, the enemy comming upon them, they cannot do it in time; and when they ſhould be in one body, they muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity abandon divers of their retreats, &amp; ſo become a ſudden prey to their enemies: Wherefore to eſcape theſe dangers, either of themſelves, or upon the motion of ſome one of authority among them, they confine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to dwell together, in a place choſen as well for their better commodity of living as more facility of defence. Of this ſort among many others were <hi>Athens</hi> &amp; <hi>Venice.</hi> The firſt under the command of <hi>Theſeus,</hi> was upon the like occaſions built by the ſcattered inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants: the other, much people being retired into certain little Ilands at the point of the <hi>Adriatique</hi> Sea (to avoid thoſe wars which then were beginning in <hi>Italy</hi> by reaſon of thoſe huge and continual inundations of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians</hi> upon the declining of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire) began among themſelves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the authority of any particular Prince, to live under thoſe lawes they thought moſt proper for their preſervation: which prov'd luckily to them, for the long quiet their ſituation gave them, that Sea having no outlet, and thoſe people which then afflicted <hi>Italy,</hi> not having ſhips to annoy them, ſo that every little beginning was ſufficient to give them that greatneſs they now have. The ſecond ſort is, when a City is built by ſtrangers which are either abſolute of themſelves, or depend upon others, &amp; ſuch
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:30490:16"/>
are colonies which are ſent out either by a Commonwealth or Prince to disburden their Towns of inhabitants, or for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of ſome country which of late they have gotten, and would ſafely keep without much expence; of which ſort the <hi>Romans</hi> built many througouht all their dominions; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were built by ſome Prince, not to make his ſeate there, but for his glory; and ſo was <hi>Alexandria</hi> by <hi>Alexander:</hi> and becauſe theſe cities have not their beginning free, they ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome attain to that greatneſs, as to be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the head cities of Kingdomes. The like be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning had <hi>Florence</hi> (whither it was built by <hi>Syllaes</hi> Souldiers, or by chance by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the mountains of <hi>Fieſola;</hi> who taking heart upon that long peace the world enjoyed under <hi>Octavian,</hi> came down &amp; dwelt in the plain upon the Arne) for it was built under the <hi>Romau</hi> government, neither could it in the beginning make greater increaſe, then what the Princes favour allow'd it. The founders of Cities are then ſaid to be abſolute and free, when any people either led by a Prince, or of themſelves, are forc'd by conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, famine, or war to abandon their native Soyle, and ſeek a new dwelling and theſe are are content to inhabite the Cities in the Country they have conquered, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did, or build new, as did <hi>Aeneas.</hi> In this caſe appeares the ability of the founder, and the fortune of the City founded, the which is more or leſs admirable, as he who gave thereto the beginning was of greater or or leſs abilities: which is ſeen in two kindes; the firſt in choyce of the ſituation, the ſecond in making the lawes. And becauſe men
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:30490:17"/>
act ſome things upon neceſſity, others by their own election, and the greater vertue is there ſeen where election hath the leaſt power; it is to be conſider'd, whether it were better to chuſe barren places to build Cities in, to the end men being forc'd to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor for their ſuſtenance, might live the better in agreement, the poverty of their Country giving leſs occaſion of diſcord, as it was in <hi>Raugia:</hi> and in many other Cities built in like places, which choyce without doubt would be wiſelier made and more profitable, of men were content to live of their own, and not ſeek to rule over others, but ſeeing it not poſſible for men to live in ſecurity with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out force, it is neceſſary to avoid a barren ſoyle, and to plant themſelves in fruitful places, where they may be enabled by the plenty of their ſeat to enlarge and deſend their territories againſt thoſe that would aſſault them, and over-maſter all that would oppoſe their greatneſs. And to the end the riches of the country occaſion not too much the eaſe of the people, it would be fit to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide that the laws oblige them to take theſe paines, the ſituation doth not, and to imitate thoſe who have liv'd in pleaſant and fruitfull countries, and apt to breed men given to Luxury, loth to uſe that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry vertue requires, and yet were ſo wiſe as to prevent thoſe harmes the plenty of the ſoyle, and ſo conſequently the peoples idleneſs might cauſe: having impos'd ſuch a neceſſity of labour upon thoſe they brought up to be Souldiers, as by means of their ſtrict diſcipline, they far ſurpaſſed others who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their rough and barren countries
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:30490:17"/>
were borne fierce; ſuch was the Kingdome of the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> that notwithſtanding the countries delicacies, the laws ſtrictneſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd ſo far, as there were bred by them many great perſonages: and if time had not worne out their names, it would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare they had deſerv'd as much praiſe, as did Great <hi>Alexauder,</hi> and many others whoſe memories ſtories continue freſh amongſt us: and whoſoever had conſidered the <hi>Soldans</hi> Kingdome, and the <hi>Mamalucks</hi> order, with their military diſcipline, before they were ruin'd by <hi>Selimus</hi> the great Turke, would have ſeen in that how the Souldiers were train'd up in continuall exerciſes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in have known how much they fear'd that caſe to which the goodneſs of their Country invited them, unleſs it had been oppos'd with ſevere lawes. I avow therefore the choyce better in a fertile place, when that good government takes order for a moderate uſe of the abundance. When <hi>Alexander</hi> the great had a purpoſe to build a City for his glory, <hi>Dinocrates</hi> the Architect came to him and ſhewed him, how it might be built upon Mount <hi>Athos,</hi> which place, beſides that it would be ſtrong, he could ſo order, that the City ſhould be made in forme of a man: which would be a wonder worthy his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: and being askd again by <hi>Alexander</hi> whereupon the inhabitants ſhould live, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerd he had not well advis'd of that point yet: whereat having laught, he left the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain alone, &amp; built <hi>Alexandria</hi> ſo, that people might reſort thither, as well for the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſoyle, as the commodity of of the ſea, and the River <hi>Nilus.</hi> Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever

then ſhall examine the beginning of <hi>Rome,</hi> if <hi>Aeneas</hi> be taken for the firſt foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, it muſt be numberd among the cities that were built by ſtrangers; If <hi>Romulus,</hi> among thoſe that were built by the Natives; And in what manner ſoever It were, it will appear it had a beginning free of it ſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out dependence of any; and moreover that the Laws made by <hi>Romulus, Numa,</hi> and others, kept it under in an exact obedience (as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after ſhall be ſaid:) ſo that neither the fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of the country, the commodity of the Sea, the oſten victories, nor the vaſtneſs of the Empire, could in many ages corrupt it; but maintained it ſo eminent for vertue, that never any commonwealth came near it.

proof, which upon that accident of <hi>Arezo</hi> in the ſecond year was anew orderd, and by that of <hi>Pirato</hi> in the twelfth inbroyld again. Intending then to treate what were the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents that brought it to perfection, I ſay, that ſome, who have writ of Commonwealths, will have it that there was one of theſe three kinds of States term'd by them a Principality, another an Ariſtocracy, and a third a Popular government: and that they who lay the firſt grounds of rule and order in a City, ought moſt to have regard to ſome one of theſe, as it ſeems fitteſt to their purpoſe. Some others (and that following the opinion of many more wiſe) think that there be ſix ſorts of governments; of which three are bad in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, and three good in themſelves, but ſo eaſie to be corrupted, that even they become pernicious. Thoſe which are good, are the three aforeſaid; the bad are the other three which depend on theſe, and every one of them in ſuch ſort reſemble that which it ap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> preaches, that they change ſuddenly from one into the other: for the Principality eaſily becomes Tyranny; that of the Nobility falls into the hands of ſome few; and the Popular will as eaſily become tumultuous: ſo that if he that lays the foundation of a Commonwealth, ordaines in a City one of theſe three ſorts, it is but for a ſmall conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance: for it is beyond the power of any remedy to hinder that it ſlip not into its contrary, for the reſemblances which in this caſe there is between the vertue and the vice. Theſe differences of governments grew by chance among men; for in the beginning of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:30490:19"/>
the World, when the inhabitants were thin, they were ſcatter'd abroad for a time like wild beaſts; afterwards man kind increaſing, they gather'd together, and that they might be able better to defend themſelves, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to caſt their eyes upon him who had the moſt ſtrength and courage among them, and made him their head and obeyed him. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon began the diſcerning of things good and honeſt from bad and hurtful: for ſeeing that if any one hurt his benefactour, it cauſed ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and pitty among men, blaming the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful, and honouring the thankful; and thinking withal that the ſame injuries might as well be done to themſelves; to avoid the like evil, they betook them to make laws and to make puniſhments againſt the offenders: Hence came the knowledge of juſtice, which was the occaſion that when they were to chuſe a Prince, they ſought not after him that was the luſtieſt, but the wiſeſt and juſteſt. But afterwards when they had their Prince by ſucceſſion, and not by election, ſuddenly the heirs began to degenerate from their ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors; and forſaking vertuous actions, they thought that Princes had nothing to do but to exceed others in luxurie and wantonneſs, and in what belong'd to their pleaſure: ſo that the Prince beginning to be hated, and becauſe he was hated to fear, and paſſing on beyond this fear to hurt, hereon grew Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny. Thence afterwards grew thoſe vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences, conſpiracies and treaſons againſt Princes, which were not undertaken by thoſe that were fearful or weak; but if any ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed others in courage, valour, wealth, and birth, thoſe were the actors, not being able
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:30490:20"/>
to indure the ſhameful life of that Prince. The multitude then following the authority of thoſe great ones, took armes againſt the Prince; and he being down, they yeelded obedience to theſe as to their deliverers: and they hating the name of one head alone, fram'd a government of themſelves, and in the beginning (in regard of the tyranny paſt) carried themſelves fairly according to the laws they had made, preferring the publique good before their own advantage, and in ſumme, rul'd and maintain'd the ſtate with exceeding diligence. This government after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards falling into the hands of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, who never knew the change of fortune, nor had the experience of adverſity, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing content to live in a civil equality, but abandoning themſelves to covetouſneſs, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, and raviſhing of women, ſo carried it, that they ingroſs'd in the hands of ſome few the government that belong'd to the whole Nobility, without any regard of the ſtate, in ſo much that it befell to them quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as to the Tyrant. For the multitude loathing their government, ſerv'd it ſelf of any one that had any deſign againſt theſe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, and ſo ſome there were quickly found that made head againſt them, who with the aid of the people put them down. And the remembrance of the Prince being yet freſh, and of the wrongs they ſuffered under him, having taken away this govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of few, and being unwilling to reſtore that of a Prince, they choſe the Popular, which they ſo ordain'd, that neither a few that were mighty, nor one Prince alone ſhould have any power there. And becauſe
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:30490:20"/>
all ſtates in the beginning are venerable, this Popular ſtate ſubſiſted a while but not long, eſpecially when that generation was out that ordain'd it: for ſuddenly they grew licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, not fearing private men, nor publick Miniſters, ſo that every one living as he liſted, they daily did one another divers outrages, and at length wereforc'd by neceſſity, or by the perſwaſion of ſome good man, for to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void ſuch inſolency, to change a new into a Principality, and ſo from thence by degrees, they grew exorbitant in their behaviour, and upon the occaſions aforeſaid: And this is the circle, in which all ſtates turning about have been and are governed: but ſeldome do they returne into the ſelf ſame govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: for hardly any Commonwealth can be of ſo long durance as to undergoe ſo many changes, and yet ſtand afoot: but rather it comes to paſs, the ſtate while it is in tumult, counſell and force then alwaies failing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ſubject to ſome neighbouring govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is better order'd then it ſelf: but were it not for this, a ſtate were always capable of revolution into theſe ſorts of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: I ſay then, that all theſe kinds are pernicious for the ſhort continuance of the three which are good; and the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the other three which are bad: Whereupon the ſage Law-givers having per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this defect, avoiding each one by it ſelf, choſe one that might partake of all, eſteeming that more ſound and firme: for the one guards the other, being that in one and the ſame City, there was the Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, Nobility, and Commonalty as parts
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:30490:21"/>
of the governments. Among thoſe, who by ſuch like ordinances have deſerv'd moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations, is <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> who made his laws after ſuch a manner in <hi>Sparta,</hi> that giving the King the Nobility, and the people their ſhares, he compos'd a government that laſted above eight hundred yeares, to his great credit and that Cities quiet. The contrary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell <hi>Solon,</hi> who made the laws in <hi>Athens,</hi> which becauſe it was a popular ſtate, prov'd but ſhort liv'd, and he before he died ſaw the Tyranny of Piſiſtratus begun: and though after forty years his heires were driven from thence, and <hi>Athens</hi> recover'd its liberty (becauſe it took again a popular government according to <hi>Solons</hi> inſtitutions) it maintain'd it not above a hundred years, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that to hold it, there were many lawes made by which the inſolences of the great men were reſtrain'd and the licentiouſneſs of all in general: which were never provided for by <hi>Solon:</hi> yet becauſe he compounded not this with the authority of the Principality as alſo of the Nobility, <hi>Athens</hi> continu'd but a ſhort time in reſpect of <hi>Sparta.</hi> But let us come to <hi>Rome,</hi> which though it had not a <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curgus</hi> to put it ſo in order that it might long ſubſiſt free, yet ſuch were the accidents that chanc'd in it, by reaſon of the diſunion of the Commonalty and the Senate, that what their founder had not provided for, chance did: for if <hi>Rome</hi> lit not upon the beſt fortune, it lit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the next to the beſt; for though the firſt ordinances were defective, yet they aim'd not amiſs at the true perfection: becauſe <hi>Romulus</hi> and all the Kings made many and good laws and theſe agreeing to the maintenance of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:30490:21"/>
liberty. But becauſe their deſign was to lay the foundations of a kingdome, and not of a Commonwealth, when the City became free, there wanted many things which were fit to be inſtituted in favour of liberty, but were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ordain'd by thoſe Kings. And albeit their Kings loſt rule upon the occaſion and by the means alledged, yet they that expel'd them preſently ſetting up two Conſuls who ſhould ſtand in the Kings ſtead, chas'd out of <hi>Rome</hi> the Regal title only, &amp; not the Regal power; ſo that there being in that Commonwealth the Conſuls and the Senate, it was compos'd only of two of theſe forenamed qualities, that is to ſay, of the Principality &amp; Nobility. There remain'd only to give the Commonalty a place in the government, whereupon the <hi>Roman</hi> Nobility being grown inſolent, upon the occaſions (which ſhall be hereafter told) the people roſe up againſt them, ſo that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to loſe all, they were conſtrain'd to allow the people their part; &amp; on the other ſide, the Senate &amp; the Conſuls were likewiſe to continue with ſo great authority as they might well maintain their degree in that Commonwealth: &amp; ſo began the creation of the <hi>Tribuns</hi> of the people, after which the ſtate of that Commonwealth became more firme, all the three kinds of governments ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their ſhares. And fortune did ſo much favour them, that though they proceeded from the rule of a King, &amp; of the Nobility, to that of the people, by the ſame degrees, and for the ſame reaſons ſet down before; yet to give power to the Nobility, they never took away all the authority from the Royalty; nor was the power of the Nobility quite dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:30490:22"/>
to give it to the people: but being ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, it made an exact Commonwealth, to which perfection it came by the departing of the Commonalty from the Senate, as it ſhall be ſhewed at length in the two next following Chapters.</p>

It ſeem'd that there was in <hi>Rome</hi> a perfect union of the People and Senate, when the <hi>Tarquins</hi> were baniſht, and that the Nobility having laid by their Pride, were become of a popular diſpoſition, and ſupportable to every one even of the meaneſt ranke. This deceit lay hid, nor was the occaſion thereof known as long as the <hi>Tarquins</hi> liv'd, of whom the Nobility being
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:30490:22"/>
afraid, and doubting that upon their ill treating of the people, they might ſide with them, behav'd themſelves with good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect towards them: But no ſooner were the <hi>Tarquins</hi> dead, and the Nobility delivered of that feare, but they began to ſpit againſt the people the poiſon that all this while had lurked in their breaſts, and in all ſorts poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to vex and moleſt them: which thing confirmes what I ſaid before, that men never do good, unleſs inforc'd thereto: but where choice is abundant, and liberty at pleaſure, confuſion and diſorder ſuddenly take place. Wherefore it is ſaid, that hunger and poverty make men laborious, and Laws make them good. But where one thing alone by it ſelf without a Law does good, there, is no need of the Law: but when that good cuſtom failes, the Law becomes neceſſary forthwith. Yet the <hi>Tarquins</hi> being foil'd, who with feare of them kept the Nobility in awe, it was fit to think out a new way which ſhould work the ſame effect the <hi>Tarquins</hi> did, when they were alive. And ſo at length after many broyles, tumults, and hazards of breaches between the people and the Nobility, at length for the peoples aſſurance, the <hi>Tribuns</hi> were created, and they bore ſuch ſway and had ſuch credit, that they could alwaies after mediate between the people and the Senate, and ſtop the Nobilities inſolency.</p>

                        <p>That the diſagreement of the People and the Senate of Rome, made the Commonwealth both free and mighty.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>I Muſt not fail to diſcourſe upon theſe tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, which were in Rome from the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quins</hi> death till the creation of the <hi>Tribuns;</hi> and afterwards upon ſome other things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the opinion of many, who ſay that Rome was a very diſorderly commonwealth, and full of ſuch confuſion, that if good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and military vertue had not ſupplyed their defects, it would have been inferiour to any. I cannot deny that fortune and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like diſcipline were cauſes of the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire: but methinks they do not conſider, that where good diſcipline is, it is likely too that there is good order, and ſeldom alſo happens it but that there is good fortune. But let us come to the other particulars of that City. I ſay that they who condemne the troubles between the Nobility and the people, to me ſeem to blame thoſe things which were the firſt occaſion of Romes liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: and that they think more of the ſtirs and noiſes which aroſe from thoſe tumults, then they regard the good effects they brought forth: and that they conſider not, how there are two ſeverall humours in every Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique, that of the Commons, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the great-ones; and how all the laws that are made in favor of liberty, ſpring firſt from their diſagreement, as eaſily we may perceive it follow'd in Rome. For from the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:30490:23"/>
                        <hi>Tarquins</hi> to the <hi>Gracchies</hi> more then 300. years, the tumults of <hi>Rome</hi> ſeldome times caus'd baniſhment, and very ſeldome blood: Inſomuch as no man can well deem theſe ſtirres hurtful, nor ſay the Commonwealth was divided, which in ſo long a time through her diſcord, baniſh'd not above eight or ten Citizens, and put very few to death, nor yet condemn'd many in ſums of money. Neither can that be term'd with reaſon in any ſort a diſorderly Commonwealth, whence we have ſo many rare examples of vertue: for good examples proceed from good education &amp; a good education from good laws, &amp; good laws from thoſe tumults which many unadviſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do condemn: for whoſoever ſhall examin the end thereof, ſhall not find that they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd any baniſhment or violence in hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the common good, but laws &amp; ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances in benefit of the publick liberty. And if any man ſhould alledge that the means were extravagant, &amp; in a manner outragions. To ſee the people together cry out againſt the Senate, and the Senate againſt the people, to run tumultuouſly through the ſtreers, to ſhut up their ſhops, and the whole people of <hi>Rome</hi> to quit the town, all which things fright even thoſe that read them. I ſay that every city ought to have its own waies whereby the people may vent their ambition, &amp; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally thoſe cities that in matters of importance wil availe themſelves of their people; among which <hi>Rome</hi> had this way, that when the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple would have a law made, either they did ſome of the things forenamed, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd to have their names inrolled for the warres, ſo that to quiet them, there was a
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:30490:24"/>
neceſſity in ſome ſort to give them ſatisfaction. And it is but ſeldom ſeen, that the deſires of free people tend to the hurt of liberty; for they ariſe either from their oppreſſion, or from their ſuſpicion they are falling into it. And in caſe theſe opinions were falſe, yet is there a meanes to rectifie them, if ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet Oratour in their aſſemblies perſwade them of their error; and the people (as <hi>Tully</hi> ſays) though of themſelves ignorant, yet are they of capacity to conceive the truth, being told them by any man worthy of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, and do eaſily ſubmit. Wherefore we ought more ſparingly to blame the <hi>Roman</hi> Government, and conſider the good effects iſſued from that Commonwealth, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver proceeded but from good cauſes. And for creating the <hi>Tribuns,</hi> they deſerve ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great praiſe; for beſides the giving to the people their ſhare of Government, they were ordain'd as guardians of the Roman liberty, as it ſhall appear in the Chapter following.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>THey who have judiciouſly laid the foundations of a Commonwealth, have, among other principal things or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd by them, provided a ſafegard for li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, which as it is rightly plac'd, ſo is it of long or ſhorter durance. And becauſe in every Republick there are the Nobility and the Commons, queſtion is made to which of theſe two more ſafely may be intruſted the Guard of liberty. And among the <hi>Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> and in our times among the <hi>Venetians</hi> it hath been given to the Nobility; but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Romans</hi> it was committed to the peoples truſt; and therefore is it neceſſary to examine which of theſe two Common-wealths made the better choyce. And if a man liſt to argue the caſe, there want not arguments on both parts: butif we look to the iſſue they had, we ſhould yeeld it to the Nobility, becauſe <hi>Sparta</hi> and <hi>Venice</hi> enjoy'd either of them their freedome, longer then <hi>Rome.</hi> And comming to argument I ſay (firſt taking part with the <hi>Romans)</hi> that they ought rather to be intruſted as guardians of any thing, who are leaſt deſirous to uſurpe it, &amp; without doubt conſidering the deſignes of the nobility &amp; of the people, we muſt needs confeſs they are very ambitious of rule, theſe only deſire not to be oppreſs'd, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently affect the continuance of their freedome, having leſs hope to uſurpe it, then the Nobility; ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:30490:26"/>
it is probable, they are more careful of it; and being themſelves out of hope of it, will never ſuffer that it fall into others hands. On the other ſide, he that argues for the <hi>Spartan</hi> and <hi>Venetian</hi> cuſtomes, ſayes, that they who intruſt it with them that are powerful, doe two good things at once; the one, that they rather give a ſatisfaction to their ambition, that having a greater part in the Common-wealth, by holding this ſtaffe in their hand they have greater reaſon to be contented: the other is, that they free the peoples un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet minds from ſuch a kinde of authority which is the occaſion of infinite diſcords and offences in the Commonwealth, and like e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to bring the Nobility to ſome deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which in time may do much miſchief: and they give us <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf for an example hereof, that when the <hi>Tribuns</hi> of the people had this authority in their hands, they were not content to have one Conſul to be a <hi>Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyan,</hi> but would have both, and thereupon they would have the Cenſor and the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, and all other dignities in the rule of the City: nor was this enough, but led on ſtill with the ſame rage, they began in after times to adore thoſe men whom they ſaw fit to curbe the Nobility, whereupon grew the power of <hi>Marius</hi> and the ruine of <hi>Rome:</hi> and, truly whoſoever ſhould ſift this matter throughly, the one and the other, would much doubt which he ſhould make choyce of for the guardians of liberty, not knowing which ſort of men is more hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſull in a Commonwealth, either that which deſires to gain the honour it hath not, or the other which endeavours to maintain what
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:30490:26"/>
they have already got; and at laſt, whoſoever ſhall examin the whole throughly, will make this concluſion; Either you reaſon of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick that aymes at ſuch a dominion as <hi>Rome</hi> had, or of one which ſeeks no farther then her own preſervation.

But to return to the point, what kind of men are the more hurtful in a Republick? either they that would enlarge the State, or thoſe that are wary not to loſe what they have already gotten; I ſay that <hi>Marcus Menenius</hi> being made Dictatour, and <hi>Marcus Follius</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the horſe, both <hi>Plebeyans,</hi> to inquire after certain conſpiracies, which were made in <hi>Capua</hi> againſt <hi>Rome,</hi> authority was alſo given from the people to find out thoſe that in <hi>Rome</hi> by ambition or any extraordinary way did ſtrive to gain the Conſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

cauſe was heard, he was abſolved: where it was argued, whether ſavour'd more of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, either he that would maintain, or he that would gain; for the one and the other appetite may occaſion very great tumults. Yet notwithſtanding moſt commonly are they caus'd by him who already hath the poſſeſſion, becauſe the feare of loſing doth breed in them the ſame deſires which are in thoſe who aime at conqueſt: becauſe men think they hold not ſurely what they have, unleſs they make a new addition of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what elſe; and beſides this, the larger ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories they are Maſter of, the greater force and power they are able to imploy in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their deſigns to effect; and this alſo may we adde, that their unlimited and ambitious behaviours kindle in the breaſts of thoſe that have not, a deſire to have, or to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd on thoſe that deſpoyle them, or elſe to become Lords themſelves of that wealth and thoſe honours, which they ſee others uſe ill.</p>

Yet it ſeems worthy the conſideration, to ſee, if it were poſſible, ſo to frame a State in <hi>Rome,</hi> as could void all differences<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>; and if a man would examin this, he ſhould have recourſe to thoſe Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, which, without ſo many fallings out and bickerings, have been long free, and ſee, what kind of State theirs was, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Rome</hi> were capable of it. An example among the ancients is <hi>Sparta,</hi> among the modernes <hi>Venice,</hi> both by me formerly named. <hi>Sparta</hi> made it ſelf a King with a little Senate to govern it. <hi>Venice</hi> divided not the government with the names, but in one general tearm, all thoſe that had a hand in it were call'd Gentlemen, which chance rather caſt on them, then the deliberation of their founder: for many inhabitants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing met together upon thoſe rocks, where now ſtands that City upon the occaſions fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, when they were grown to ſuch a number, that for them to live together it
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:30490:28"/>
was neceſſary for them to ordain Lawes they appointed a forme of government, and meeting alſo together in Counſel to adviſe touching the City, when they found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of ſufficient number to make up a body politick, they excluded all others who afterwards in proceſs of time ſhould come to dwell there, from all power in State affaires. And in ſucceſs of time, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there were many inhabitants in the place out of the Government, to give them reputation that govern'd, they call'd them Gentlemen, and the others <hi>Plebeyans.</hi> So that this order might well be begun and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued without the diſlike of any: for when it was firſt made, every one that dwelt at <hi>Venice,</hi> did equally partake of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo that none could complain: they, who afterwards came to inhabit there, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the State ſetled and limited, had neither occaſion nor meanes to make any tumult: there was no occaſion, becauſe nothing was taken from them: and the meanes they had not, becauſe they that govern'd kept them in ſubjection, nor truſted them ſo far with any imployment that they could take autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity upon them. Add hereunto, that they who afterwards came to inhabit <hi>Venice,</hi> were not many, nor of ſo great a number, that there was diſproportion between the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors and thoſe that were governed; for the number of the Gentlemen was either e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to them, or greater then they were: ſo that for theſe reaſons <hi>Venice</hi> could well begin ſuch a State and maintain it in unity. <hi>Sparta,</hi> as I ſaid, was govern'd by a King and a ſtrict Senate, and might well maintain
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:30490:28"/>
it ſelf ſo a long time; becauſe there being in <hi>Sparta</hi> but few inhabitants, and they having ſeis'd upon the Government in prevention of thoſe that ſhould afterwards come to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit there, and with reputation living in obſervance of <hi>Lycurgus</hi> Lawes, took away quite all occaſion of diſcord, ſo that they might eaſily continue together in a long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement; for <hi>Lycurgus</hi> by his Laws ordain'd in <hi>Sparta</hi> more equality of eſtates, and leſs of dignities; for here poverty was to all alike; and the <hi>Plebeyans</hi> leſs ambitious: for the Magiſtracies of the City were commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable only to ſome few Citizens, and were held apart from the People, neither did the Nobility ever with their harſh uſage make them covetous of them. This eame from the <hi>Spartan</hi> Kings, who being plac'd in that Principality, and ſet in the midſt of that Nobility, had no ſurer means to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their dignity ſtedfaſt, then to defend the People from injurious oppreſſions: which made the People, that it neither feared nor affected the Government, and not having the rule nor fearing it, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention they might have with the Nobility was quite avoided, and all occaſion of tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults: and in this ſort they might live in peace a long time. But two principal things caus'd this agreement; becauſe the inhabitants of <hi>Sparta</hi> were few, and therefore might be govern'd by few: the other, becauſe not accepting of ſtrangers into their Republick, they had not occaſion, either of being cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, or making great increaſe, ſo as to become inſupportable to thoſe few that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd them. Wherefore conſidering theſe
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:30490:29"/>
things, it appears; that the founders of <hi>Rome</hi> were to have us'd one of theſe two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedients, if they deſir'd to maintain it quicker, like one of theſe Commonwealths we have ſpoken of: either not to imploy the common people in War, as the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians;</hi> or not admit ſtrangers into the City, as the <hi>Spartans:</hi> both of which they did, which gave the people force and increaſe, and ſundry occaſions of tumults. So that if the <hi>Roman</hi> State grew more quiet, this inconvenient follow'd, that it was alſo weaker; becauſe it diſabled it ſelf of the means to come to the greatneſs it attain'd. And therefore, if <hi>Rome</hi> would take away the occaſions of diſagreements, it took away the means of amplifying the State. And in all humane affaires it is plain, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever does throughly examin it, that upon the cutting off one inconvenient, another will ſtreight ariſe: therefore if thou wouldſt make a numerous and a warlike people to inlarge far the bounds of the Empire, thou mak'ſt them of ſuch a temper, that they ſhall never be maneggiable at thy will; a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

nor then, as ſhee, not increaſe the number of her Citizens, having a deſire to extend her dominions: which was the cauſe that a King for terme of life, and the little num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Senators, touching their agreement, would have nothing availd. Whereupon if a man were anew to lay grounds of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick, he ſhould firſt reſolve, whether hee would have it extend its power and rule, as <hi>Rome:</hi> or confine it ſelf to ſmall limits. In the firſt caſe then, hee muſt order it, as <hi>Rome,</hi> and give place to tumults and general differences, the beſt he may; for without great number of men, and thoſe warlike, could never any Commonwealth increaſe, or if it increaſe, continue. In the ſecond caſe thou maiſt ſo order it, as <hi>Sparta</hi> or <hi>Venice.</hi> But by reaſon that ambition to extend the dominions, is the poiſon of ſuch like Commonwealths, their founder ought, as much as may be, in all thoſe waies for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid them to inlarge themſelves; for all ſuch gaines grounded upon a weake Common-wealth, do quite ruine it, as it befell <hi>Sparta</hi> and <hi>Venice:</hi> whereof the firſt, having ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued as it were all <hi>Greece,</hi> upon a very ſmall accident, diſcover'd its own weak founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for the Rebellion of <hi>Thebes</hi> following, caus'd by <hi>Pelopidas,</hi> with other Cities imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, utterly ruin'd that Republick.

to place it in a ſtrong ſituation, and make it of ſuch reſiſtance, that no man can hope to ſubdue it on a ſudden; and on the otherſide, that it be not ſo great, to become a terror to the neighbors, and ſo likely it may long enjoy its State. For upon two occaſions ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily men make War againſt a Republick; the one, to become maſter of it, the other for fear it become maſter of them. And this way I have ſpoken of, takes quite away theſe two cauſes; for if it be hard to overcome, as I preſuppoſe it, being well furniſh'd for defence, it will ſeldome, or never chance that any can make a deſign to conquer it: and if it containes it ſelf within its own limits, and it be manifeſt by experience, that in it there is no ambition, it ſhall never come to paſs, that any for feare in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt its quiet. And this would the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be, if in it were made a Law or order to forbid the amplifying of the State. And without doubt I beleeve, that the bringing of things to conſiſt in theſe termes and in this equality of temper, were the true civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and the perfect quiet of a City. But being that all humane things are in continual motion, and nothing ſtands firm, they muſt ever be riſing or falling. And to many things that reaſon doth not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade thee, neceſſity bindes thee; ſo that having ſettled a Commonwealth able to maintain it ſelf, not augmenting; and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity ſhould force it to inlarge it ſelf, it would manifeſtly looſen its own founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſuddenly bring it ſelf to ruine. On the otherſide, if the heavens ſhould prove ſo favourable, as to blow away all clouds
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:30490:30"/>
and tempeſts of War, thence would ariſe that ſloth and idleneſs would either divide them, or make them effeminate. Which two things together, or either by it ſelf, would occaſion their ruine And therefore, being impoſſible (as I think) to poiſe all things ſo juſtly by the balance, or reduce them to this perfection of temper, it is propereſt, in founding the Republick, to provide for the moſt honorable part, and ſo to order it, that when neceſſity ſhall inforce its inlarging, it may be able to keep what it hath gotten. And to return to our firſt diſcourſe, I think it neceſſary to follow the <hi>Roman</hi> Ordinances, and not thoſe of other Common wealths; for to find a mediocrity between the one and the other, I think it not poſſible. And thoſe enmities, which ſhould grow betwixt the people and the Senate, ought to be tolerated, taking them for a neceſſary inconvenient, to attain to <hi>Romes</hi> greatneſs. For beſides other reaſons alledged, where the authority of the <hi>Tribunes</hi> is prov'd neceſſary for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of liberty, it manifeſtly appears what great benefit they make in Commonwealths of the power of accuſing, which among other things was committed to the <hi>Tribunes,</hi> as in the Chapter following ſhall be declar'd.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>How uſeful accuſations are in a Republike for the maintenance of Liberty.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THere cannot be a more profitable or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary power given to thoſe that in a city are appointed as guardians of the liberty, then is that of accuſing the Citizens to the people, or before any Magiſtrate, or any councel, whenſoever they offend in any thing againſt the free State. This order workes two very uſeful effects in a Republick. The firſt is, that the Citizens for feare of being accuſed, attempt nothing againſt the State; and in caſe they do, forthwith without any reſpect given them, are ſuppres'd. The other is, that it gives a way to vent the humours that grow in the Cities, in any manner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any Citizens. And when theſe hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours have not ordinary vents, they burſt out extraordinary waies, and ſo are the ruine of a Commonwealth. And there is not any thing renders a Republick more ſetled and ſtedfaſt, then to ordain it in ſuch a manner, that the alteration of theſe humours that ſtir it, have ſome out-let, appointed by the Lawes; which may be ſhew'd by divers exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and eſpecially by that of <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> which <hi>Titus Livius</hi> reports: where he ſaies, that the Nobility of <hi>Rome</hi> being angry with the people, as thinking them to have too much Authority, by creation of the <hi>Tribunes,</hi> who protected them; and <hi>Rome</hi> (as ſome time it chances) being in great want of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, and thereupon the Senate ſent for
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:30490:31"/>
Corne into <hi>Sicily, Coriolanus</hi> an Enemy of the popular faction advis'd, that now the time was come, they had power to chaſtiſe the people, and to take away that Authority which they had laid hold on in prejudice of the Nobility, by keeping them in hunger and want, diſtributing the Corn to them. Which opinion of his they hearing of, took ſuch diſtaſt againſt <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> that had not the <hi>Tribunes</hi> cited him to appear to defend his cauſe, the people had ſlain him in a tumult as he came out of the Senate. Upon which accident, we note that which before was ſaid, how fit and uſefull it is, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths with their Lawes give meanes to vent the choler, which the univerſality hath conceiv'd againſt any one Citizen. For when they have not theſe ordinary meanes, they have recourſe to extraordinary; and out of queſtion theſe are of worſe effect then thoſe. For if by an orderly courſe one Citizen be ſſuppres'd, although it were wrongfully done, yet follwes thereupon little or no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order in the Republick, becauſe the execution is done without any private mans power, or aſſiſtance of forrein forces, which are thoſe, that take away the common liberty; but by the publick and lawful power, which have their particular bounds, nor any way paſs ſo far as to endammage, the Commonwealth. And to confirm this opinion with examples, this of <hi>Coriolanus</hi> from the ancients ſhall ſuffice me; upon which let every one conſider, what miſchief thereby had faln on the Common-wealth of <hi>Rome,</hi> if in a tumult he had been flain; for thereupon had grown offences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween particular men; offences cauſe feare,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:30490:32"/>
feare ſeekes defence, for defence men make partiſans, and thus parties grow in Cities, and from them the ruine of Cities. But the matter being order'd by publick authority, they took away all thoſe miſchiefes which might have happen'd, had it been carried by private power; we have ſeen in our daies what innovations it hath brought on the <hi>Florentine</hi> Republick, in that the multitude had no legal meanes to vent their diſpleaſure againſt a ſingle Citizen: as it befel in the time of <hi>Franciſcus Valorus,</hi> who was as it were Prince of the City, and being by many thought ambitious, and a man that by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent and high ſtomack would not content himſelf to live within a civil Government, and there being no way in the Commonwealth to reſiſt him, unleſs with ſome faction oppoſite to his, thence it came, that he not doubting other then ſome extraordinary meanes, began to ſeek favourers of his party, to defend him. On the other ſide, they that oppos'd him, having no ready way to ſuppreſs him, devis'd ſome extraordinary waies: inſomuch as they came at length to fight, and where (if by an ordinary courſe he could have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd:) his power had ſunk with his own loſs onely a now having to uſe extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry meanes in breaking it, there enſued not only his, but the ruine of many other Noble Citizens. There might alſo be alledged, to confirm our former concluſion, the accident chanc'd in <hi>Florence,</hi> upon the occaſion of <hi>Peter Soderinus,</hi> which wholly proceeded from the want of meanes in that Republick, to accuſe the ambition of ſome powerful Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens; for, it was not enough to accuſe a
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:30490:32"/>
mighty man, before eight Judges in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth. The Judges ought to be in great number; for a few do after the manner of two or three; ſo that if ſuch courſes were taken, either the Citizens would have accus'd him living ill, and thereby, without calling the Spaniſh Army to aid, would have wreak'd their anger on him; or not beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving himſelf ill, they durſt not have ventur'd to ſeek his ruine, for feare themſelves of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring danger. And ſo on all ſides had ceas'd that ravenous cruelty, which was the cheif occaſion of offence. Whereupon we may conclude this, that ſo oft as we ſee forrein forces call'd upon by any party of Citizens, we may well beleeve that in that City there is lack of good, Ordinances: even lack of that ordinary meanes to vent without extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary waies the maligne humors which grow in men; whereunto it is ſufficiently remedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by allowing of accuſations before many Judges, and withall countenancing them. Which courſes were ſo well order'd in <hi>Rome,</hi> that in ſo many quarrels between the people and the Senate, neither the one nor the other, nor any particular Citizen ever intended to availe themſelves by any forreign ſtrength; becauſe they having a remedy at home, were not neceſſitated to go ſeek it abroad. And though the examples above written are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to prove this, yet I will alledg another, related by <hi>Titus Livius</hi> in his Hiſtory: who reports, that in <hi>Cluſia,</hi> the Nobleſt City in thoſe daies in all <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> by one <hi>Lucumon Aruns</hi> was raviſhed, and he, not being able to work his revenge by reaſon of the raviſhers might, went and found out the <hi>French-men</hi>
                        <pb n="36" facs="tcp:30490:33"/>
who then raign'd in that place we now call <hi>Lombardy</hi> and encourag'd them to bring an Army to <hi>Cluſia,</hi> ſhowing them that with their gain they might revenge him of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury done him: and if <hi>Aruns</hi> had ſeen poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to have been righted by any means in the City, he never would have inquir'd after any barbarous power. But as theſe accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are profitable in a Commonwealth: ſo are calumnies unprofitable and hurtful, as it ſhall appear by our diſcourſe in the next Chapter.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Accuſations are not more beneficial to Common-wealths, then Calumnies pernitious.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>NOtwithſtanding, that the virtue of <hi>Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius Camillus,</hi> after he had freed the City of <hi>Rome</hi> from the ſiege and oppreſſion of the <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> had brought to paſs, that none of the Citizens of <hi>Rome</hi> thought it took any way from their credit or degree, to give him place: yet <hi>Manlius Capitolinus</hi> could not endure that ſo much honor and renown ſhould be aſcribed to him. Being of opinion, that touching the ſafety of <hi>Rome,</hi> in that he, had defended the Capitol from the Enemies he deſerv'd as much as <hi>Camillus;</hi> and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of other warlike glories, he was no way ſecond to him. So that overburden'd with envy, nor being able to take reſt for this mans honor, and perceiving he could ſow no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord among the Fathers, he made his addreſs to the people, ſcattering among them divers
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:30490:33"/>
ſiniſter opinions. And among other things, he ſaid this alſo, that the treaſure which was collected for the <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> and after not given them, was uſurp'd by ſome private Citizens; and if it were had again, it might be turn'd to the publick good, eaſing the people of their tributes, or ſome private debts. Theſe words were of force with the people, ſo that they began to run together, and as they liſted to raiſe many tumults in the City: Which thing much diſpleaſing the Senat, and they taking it for a matter of great moment, and dangerous, created a Dictatour, that he might examin the caſe, and bridle the violence of <hi>Manlius.</hi> Whereupon the Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor cited him, and they met in publick one againſt the other, the Dictator environ'd with the Nobility, <hi>Manlius</hi> with the People, <hi>Manlius</hi> was demanded, who had the treaſure he ſpoke of, for the Senate was as deſirous to underſtand as the people. Whereunto <hi>Manlius</hi> anſwer'd not particularly, but as by excuſes, ſaid there was no need to tell them what they already knew, ſo that the Dictator caus'd him to be put in priſon. Hereupon may we obſerve, how extreamly pernicious and damageable are calumnies, as well in free Cities, as in any other kind of Government; and therefore to repreſs them ought not any Law or Ordinance be ſpar'd, that may ſerve to the purpoſe. Neither can there be found any better expedient to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh them, then to open many waies to accuſations; for as they do much help a Republick, ſo calumnies hurt it: and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>on the other part, there is this difference, that calumnies have no need of Teſtimonies, nor
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:30490:34"/>
of any particular incounter to prove them; ſo that every one may be caluminated, but not accus'd; accuſations being tied to certain particulars and circumſtances, to udemon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate their truth. Men are accus'd before Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, the People and Councells; ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd they are by calumnies, as well in private as in publick. And there ſlander is moſt in uſe, where accuſations are nor accuſtomed, and where the Cities are loth to receive them. Therefore every founder of a Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ought ſo to order it, that therein any Citizen may be accuſed without feare or ſuſpect. And this done and well obſerv'd, he ought ſharply to puniſh the ſlanderers, who have no reaſon to complain when they are puniſh'd, there being publick places to heare his accuſations, whom they in private would have ſlandered. And where this part is not well order'd, there alwaies follows much confuſion; for calumnies do provoke and not chaſtiſe the Citizens; and thoſe that are provok'd, think to availe themſelves ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by hating, then fearing the things that are ſaid againſt them. This part (as it is ſaid) was well order'd at <hi>Rome,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ill in our City of <hi>Florence.</hi> And as at <hi>Rome</hi> this order did much good, ſo at <hi>Florence</hi> this diſorder did much harme: And whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever reades the ſtories of this City, ſhall ſee, how many ſlanders have from time to time been devis'd againſt thoſe Citizens, who have been imployed in the moſt important affairs of it. Of one they ſaid, he rob'd the common: Treaſury; of another, he fail'd of ſuch an attempt, being corrupted; and of a third, he ran, into this or that inconvenient
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:30490:34"/>
through ambition. From whence proceeded, that on every ſide grew hatred; whereupon came diviſion, from diviſion they came to factions, from factions to ruine. But had there been a meanes in <hi>Florence</hi> to accuſe the Citizens, and puniſh ſlanderers, that infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number of calumnies, that afterward grew, had never followed; for thoſe Citizens either condemned or aſſoild that they had been, could never have hurt the City, and would have been leſs accuſed, then they were ſlander'd; every one (as I have ſaid) being not ſo readily able to accuſe as to ſlander. And among other things, ſome Citizens have ſerv'd themſelves of theſe calumnies, as ſteps and helps to their ambitious ends; who having to incounter powerful men oppoſed themſelves as they liſted, and left nothing undone to work their intent; for taking part with the people, and confirming them in their evil opinion, already conceived of theſe, have made the people their own friends. And though I could bring examples enough, I will be content with this one. The <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> Army was in the field at <hi>Lucca</hi> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by <hi>John Guicchiard</hi> an able Captain. Either his Government was ſo ill, or the ſucceſs prov'd ſo unlucky, that he faild in taking the Town. So that howſoever the caſe ſtood, <hi>John</hi> was blam'd for it, ſaying, he had been bribed by the Luccheſes: which ſlander being favour'd by his Enemies, brought <hi>John</hi> to extream deſpair. And though to juſtifie himſelf he offer'd his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to trial and impriſonment, yet could he never wipe away that blur, becauſe in that Commonwealth there were not the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:30490:35"/>
meanes to do it, whereupon grew much diſtaſt between <hi>Johns</hi> friends, who were the greater part of the potent men, and his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, who were ſome that deſir'd to make innovations in <hi>Florence.</hi> Which matter, upon theſe and otherlike occaſions, increaſed ſo, that thereupon enſued the ruine of that Republique. <hi>M. Capitolinus</hi> therefore was a ſlanderer, and not an accuſer, and the <hi>Romans</hi> ſhewed directly in this caſe, how ſlanderers ought to be puniſh'd. For they ought to make them become accuſers: and when the accuſation proves true, either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them, or at leaſt not puniſh them; and when falſe, puniſh them, as <hi>Manlius.</hi>

Nay rather there is a neceſſity of it, that that one be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:30490:36"/>
that appoints the manner how, and by whoſe underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all ſuch ordination is regulated. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a wiſe founder of a Republick, who ſeeks not his own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, but the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good; not to ſtrengthen his own ſucceſſion, but ſeeks his Countries profit, ought indeavor to get the power wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his own hands: neither will any man of good judgment ever blame any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary action he ſhall put in practice, for the ſetling of a good Government in a Kingdom, or fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming ſure foundations in a Commonwealth. It holds well together, though the act accuſe him, that the effect excuſe him; and when that is good, as it prov'd to <hi>Romulus,</hi> it will alwaies excuſe him; for he that uſes violence to waſte, is blameable, not he that uſes it for redreſs and order. And therefore ought he be ſo wiſe and virtuous, that the Authority he hath poſſeſt himſelf of, he leave not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend hereditarily on another. For men being more inclined to ill then good, his ſucceſſor may turne that to ambition which he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd vertuouſly. Beſides this, though one
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:30490:36"/>
be fit to ordein a thing, yet its not ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dein'd to laſt long, when it reſts upon the ſhoulders of one man; well may it indure, being committed to the care of many, to whom it belongs to maintain it. For even ſo, as many are not proper for the framing of one thing, becauſe all of them hit not on the true good of it, by reaſon of their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral opinions among them ſo; after they have known it, neither agree they to let it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to its advantage. And that <hi>Romulus</hi> was one of thoſe, who for the death of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and companion, might be excus'd: and that what he did was for the common good, and not for his own ambition, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, in that he forth with ordain'd a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, with whom he might take counſell, and by their opinions be advis'd. And he, who conſiders well the Authority <hi>Romulus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd himſelf, will perceive it was no more than to command the Armies, when they had reſolv'd on War; and to aſſemble the Senate; which was apparent afterwards, when <hi>Rome</hi> became free upon the baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Tarquins:</hi> whereupon the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> were never brought in any new order, unleſs that in lieu of a King during life, they made two Conſuls yearly: Which confirms, that all the firſt ordinances of that City were more agreeable to a civil and free Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then to one abſolute and Monarchical. To verifie the thing aboveſaid, we might bring many examples, as <hi>Moſes, Lycurgus, Solon,</hi> and other founders of Kingdomes and Commonwealths, who could well, having an abſolute power in their hands, ordain laws for the common good; but I will let
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:30490:37"/>
them paſs, as well know. I ſhall alleadg only one, not ſo famous, but well worthy their conſideration, who deſire to be good Law-makers: which is, That <hi>Agis</hi> King of <hi>Sparta</hi> adviſing to reduce the Spartans with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thoſe bounds the Laws of <hi>Licurgus</hi> had included them; thinking that, becauſe they had broken out of that ſtrictneſs, his City had loſt very much of the ancient vertue, and by conſequent of force and government, was in the beginning of his attempts ſlain by the Spartan <hi>Ephores,</hi> as one, that aim'd to poſſeſs himſelf of the Tyranny. But <hi>Cleomenes</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſucceeding him in the Kingdom, upon his reading of <hi>Agis</hi> Records and Writings, which fell into his hands, he underſtood his intention, and grew deſirous himſelf, to bring the ſame thing to paſs; but found it was impoſſible to do that good to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, unleſs he became abſolute of authority, it ſeeming to him, by reaſon of mens ambition, that he was unable to do good to many, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the will of a few. And taking a fit opportunity, at length hee brought in all the <hi>Ephores,</hi> and every one elſe that could with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand him, and afterwards reſtor'd into force <hi>Licurgus</hi> his Lawes: Which delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had bin able to have a new reviv'd <hi>Sparta,</hi> and gain'd <hi>Cleomenes</hi> the reputation <hi>Licur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> had, if then the <hi>Macedons</hi> power had not grown ſo vaſt, and the other Grecian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick been ſo weake.

unperfect. Whereſore, upon the weighing of all theſe things together, I conclude, it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that a founder of a Republiek ought alone to have an abſolute authority; and that <hi>Romulus,</hi> for the death of <hi>Remus</hi> and <hi>Tatius,</hi> deſerves rather excuſe than blame.</p>

And to all other men, whoſe number is infinite, wee uſe to give that ſhare of commendations, which their Art and Skill deſerves.

They would ſee alſo how <hi>Timoleon</hi> and thoſe of his like had no lefs power in their Country, then had <hi>Dionyſius</hi> or <hi>Phalaris;</hi> but they would find alſo they had far more ſecurity. Nor let any be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eeived by <hi>Ceſars</hi> glory, ſeeing his memory much celebrated by writers: for they that Praiſe him, were corrupted by his fortune, and frighted by the continuance of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:30490:38"/>
which being govern'd under that name, gave not writers leave to ſpeak freely of him. But he that would know what free writers would ſay of him, let him look upon that they ſay of <hi>Cataline:</hi> and <hi>Ceſar</hi> is ſo much the more to be diſprais'd, in that he executed the ill, the other did but intend. Let him ſee alſo how much they praiſe <hi>Brutus;</hi> ſo that not daring to blame the other, becauſe of his power, they attributed much honor to his Enemy. Let him conſider alſo him that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Prince in a Republick, what praiſes, after <hi>Rome</hi> was made an Empire, thoſe Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors rather deſerv'd, that liv'd under the Laws, as good Princes, than they that went a contrary courſe to them; and he ſhall find, that <hi>Titus, Nerva, Trajan, Adrian,</hi> and <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> and <hi>Marcus</hi> had no need of <hi>Praetorian</hi> ſoldiers, nor a multitude of the legions to guard them; for their own vertues, the good will of the people, and the love of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate did defend them. Moreover he ſhall ſee, that the Eaſtern and Weſtern Armies were not enough to ſave <hi>Caligula, Nero, Vitellius,</hi> and the other wicked Emperors from their Enemies, whom their vile conditions and damned lives had procured them. And if their Story were well read over, it might ſerve to give good inſtruction to any Prince, to ſhew him the way of glory and of diſgrace, the way of ſecurity, and of diſtruſt. Fot of 26 Emperors, that were from <hi>Ceſar</hi> to <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus,</hi> 16 were ſlain, 10. only died natural deaths. And if any of thoſe that were ſlain were good, as <hi>Galba</hi> and <hi>Pertinax,</hi> it proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the corruption the predeceſſor had left among the ſoldiers. And if among thoſe,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:30490:39"/>
thoſe that died natural deaths, any were wicked or lewd, as <hi>Severus,</hi> it was cauſ'd by his great fortune and valonr, which two accompany very few. Hee ſhall ſee alſo by reading this Story, how a man may order a good King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: for all thoſe Emperours that ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in the Empire by inheritance, except <hi>Titus,</hi> were miſchievous; thoſe that were adopted, were all good, as were thoſe five from <hi>Nerva</hi> to <hi>Marcus.</hi> And as the Empire fell upon the heyres, it return'd alwaies to its deſtruction. Let a Prince be put in mind of the times from <hi>Nerva</hi> to <hi>Marcus,</hi> and compare them with thoſe that went before them, and that follow'd them; let him chooſe in which he would have been borne, or over whether he would have had command. For in thoſe that were govern'd by the good, he ſhall ſee a Prince live in ſecurity in the midſt of his ſecure Citizens, the world repleniſh'd with peace and juſtice, the Senate enjoying their authority, the Magiſtrates their honours, and the wealthy Citizens their eſtates, nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and vertue exalted, and with theſe all reſt and good. And on the other ſide all ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, diſſoluteneſs, corruption, and ambition extinguiſhed, he ſhall ſee a returne of the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den age, where every one may keep and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend what reputation he pleaſes, and in the end ſhall ſee the world triumph, the Prince reverenc'd and honour'd, and the people in agreement and ſecurity If afterwards he conſider ſeverally the times of the other Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, he ſhall find the warres made them terrible, and ſeditions full of diſcord; as well in peace as in war cruell; ſo many Princes ſlain with the ſword, ſo many civil, ſo many
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:30490:39"/>
forrain warres, <hi>Italy</hi> afflicted, and full of new misfortunes, the Cities thereof having been ſackt and ruin'd; he ſhall ſee <hi>Rome</hi> burnt, the Capitol by her own Citizens de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac'd and ſpoyl'd, the antient temples deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and their ceremonies neglected, the cities repleate with adulteries, the ſea full of ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, and the rocks beſmeard with blood. He ſhall ſee follow in <hi>Rome</hi> a numberleſs number of cruelties; and Nobility, wealth, honours, and above all, vertue reputed as a moſt capital crime. He ſhall ſee accuſers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded, ſervants corrupted againſt their maſters, children againſt their parents, and they, who had not enemies, oppreſſed by their friends, and then he ſhall know very well, how much <hi>Rome, Italy,</hi> and the world was beholding to <hi>Caeſar.</hi> And without doubt, if he be borne of mankind, he will be frighted from imitating thoſe wicked times, and inflam'd with zeale to trace the good.

                        <p>Of the Romans Religion.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THough <hi>Romulus</hi> were <hi>Romes</hi> firſt founder, and ſhe was to acknowledge from him her birth and bringing up; notwithſtanding the heavens judging that <hi>Romulus</hi> his lawes were not ſufficient for ſuch an Empire, put it into the Roman Senat's mindes to elect <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> to ſucceed <hi>Romulus,</hi> that what he left unfiniſhed, the other might ſupply. Who finding a very fierce people, and being deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to reduce them into civil obedience by peaceable waies, applied himſelf to Religion, as a thing wholly neceſſary to preſerve civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; and ordain'd it in ſuch a ſort, that for many ages there was not ſuch a feare of God, as in that Commonwealth. Which facilita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted much any enterpriſe, whatſoever either the Senate, or thoſe brave Roman courages did undertake. And whoſoever ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the innumerable actions of the people of <hi>Rome</hi> jointly, and of many of the <hi>Romans</hi> by themſelves in ſeverall, ſhal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that thoſe Citizens fear'd more to break an oath, than the lawes; as they that made more account of the power of God, than of man; as it appears manifeſtly, by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:30490:40"/>
of <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Manlius Torquatus:</hi> for after that <hi>Hannibal</hi> had given the <hi>Romans</hi> an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw at <hi>Canna,</hi> many Citizens aſſembled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and being affrighted reſolv'd to quit the country, and go into <hi>Sieily;</hi> which <hi>Scipio</hi> underſtanding went and found them out, and with his ſword drawn in his hand compelled them to ſweare, they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver forſake their native country. <hi>Lucius Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> that was afterwards call'd <hi>Torquatus,</hi> was accus'd by <hi>Marcus Pomponius</hi> Tribune of the people, and before the judgment day came, <hi>Titus</hi> went to find <hi>Marcus,</hi> and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to kill him if he ſwore not to take the accuſation off from his father, bound him by his oath: and he though by feare compell'd to ſweare, yet took the accuſation off: and ſo thoſe Citizens, whom neither the love to their country, nor the lawes thereof could retain in <hi>Italy,</hi> were kept by force of an oath they were conſtrained to take: and that <hi>Tribune</hi> laid aſide the hatred he bore to the father, the injury he receiv'd of the ſon, and his own reputation, to keep the oath he took: which proceeded of nothing elſe, but the Religion <hi>Numa</hi> brought in among them. And it is manifeſt, if a man conſider well the <hi>Roman</hi> hiſtories, of how much availe their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was for the commanding of armies, to reconcile the common people, to preſerve good men, and to ſhame the lewd. So that if we were to diſpute, to whether Prince <hi>Rome</hi> were more oblig'd, <hi>Romulus</hi> or <hi>Numa;</hi> I beleeve <hi>Numa</hi> would be prefer'd; for where Religion is, military diſcipline is eaſily brought in; and where they are already warlike, and have no Religion, this hardly followes.
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:30490:41"/>
And it is plain, that <hi>Romulus</hi> to order the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and frame certain other civil and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary ordinances, had no need of the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of a God, which to <hi>Numa</hi> was neceſſary, who feign'd to have familiar converſation with a Nymph, who inſtructed him where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with continually to adviſe the people. And all ſprung from this, becauſe he deſiring to ſettle new orders, and unaccuſtomed in that City, doubted that his own authority was not of full force. And truly never was there yet any maker of extraordinary laws in a nation, that had not his recourſe to God; for other. wiſe the laws had not been accepted. For many ſeveral goods are known by a wiſe man, which have not ſuch evident reaſons in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that he by perſwaſion can quickly make others conceive them. Therefore the wiſe men, that would free themſelves of this difficulty, have recourſe to a God: ſo did <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> ſo <hi>Solon,</hi> ſo many others, whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was the ſame with theirs. Thereupon the people of <hi>Rome</hi> admiring his goodneſs and wiſdom yeelded to all his purpoſes. But it is true, becauſe thoſe times were then full of Religion, and thoſe men rude and groſs, on whom he ſpent his pains, this much faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litated his deſigns, being thereby able to mould them into a new forme. And without queſtion, if any one in theſe daies would frame a Republick, he ſhould find it eaſier to deale with rude mountainers, who had never known any civility, than with thoſe who had been accuſtomed to live in Cities, where the government's corrupted: and a carver ſhall eaſier cut a ſaire Statue out of a rough marble, than out of one that hath been bungl'd
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:30490:41"/>
upon by another. Wherefore having well conſidered all, I conclude, that the Religion introduc'd by <hi>Nutna</hi> was one of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal occaſions of that cities happineſs; for that caus'd good orders, good orders brought good fortune, and from their good fortunes grew all the happy ſucceſſes of their enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: and as the obſervance of divine worſhip occaſions the greatneſs of a Commonwealth; ſo the contempt of it deſtroys it. For where the feare of God is wanting, it muſt needs be that either that Kingdom goes to ruine, or that it be ſupported by the awe it ſtands in of the Prince, who may ſupply the defects of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: and becauſe Princes are but ſhort-liv'd, that Kingdom muſt needs have an end quickly, according as the vertue thereof failes: from whence it comes, that governments which depend upon the vertue of one man, abide but a while, becauſe that vertue ends with his life; and it ſeldome chances that it is renew'd by ſucceſſion, as well ſaies the Poet <hi>Dante.</hi>

                     <p>Therefore the ſafety of a commonwealth or kingdom conſiſts not wholly in a Prince that governs wiſely while he lives, but in one that ſo orders it, that he dying, it can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it ſelf. And although it be eaſier to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:30490:42"/>
work rude and untaught people to a new courſe and frame, yet argues it not therefore an impoſſibility to prevaile with men that have liv'd in a civill government, and preſume ſomewhat to underſtand themſelves.

I will not judge whether it were true or not, becauſe we ought not to ſpeak of ſuch a great perſonage, but with reverence. But truly I ſay, that very many beleev'd him, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſeen any great matter to perſwede them thereto: for his life, doctrine, and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject he took, were ſufficient to make them credit him. Wherefore let no man be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, as if he could not reach to what another hath heretofore attaind; for men, as we ſaid in our preface, were born, liv'd and died, under the ſame laws of nature.</p>

                     <p>THoſe Princes or thoſe Republicks which would keep themſelves from ruine, are above all other things, to preſerve the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of their Religion incorrupted, and maintain it alwaies venerable. For there is no greater ſign of a countries going to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, then to ſee in it the contempt of divine worſhip. And this is eaſie to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:30490:42"/>
it being once known upon what ground the Religion is built where a man is born. For every Religion hath the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its being upon ſome principal thing. The life of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> Religion ſubſiſted upon the anſwers of the oracles, and upon the ſect of the conjecturers and ſoothſayers: all the other ceremonies, ſacrifices, and rites de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on theſe. Becauſe they eaſily believ'd, that that God that could foretell thee thy future good or evill, could alſo ſend it thee. From hence came the Temples, the Sacrifices and ſupplications, and all other ceremonies in their veneration: for the Oracle of <hi>Delos,</hi> the Temple of <hi>Jupiter Ammon,</hi> and other famous Oracles held the world in devotion and admiration. As they afterwards began to ſpeak in imperious manner, and their falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood was diſcover'd among the people, men began to be incredulous, and apt to diſturb all good orders, Therefore the Princes of a Republick or Kingdom ſhould maintain the grounds of the Religion they hold; and this being done, they ſhall eaſily keep their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth religious, and eonſequently ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and united. They ought alſo to favour and increaſe all thoſe things that advantage it, howſoever that they think them falſe; and the rather ſhould they do it, the wiſer they <note place="margin">* <hi>Ammiratus taxes him, ſaying,</hi> it was rather the opinion of a cunning and crafty man, then of one that had either any religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or morality in him, whoſe plain and <hi>ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple conditions ought to be free from all fraud and falſhood; and however the</hi> Romans <hi>were deceiv'd herein, which cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd, yet without doubt they never did this, thinking to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive themſelves, or with intention to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive others.</hi> Thus Ammi. And indeed it ſavours of Atheiſme, bringing the miſtreſs to ſerve the hand-maid, religion to ſerve policy; as if the ſeaſons of the year ought to accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date themſelves to men, rather then men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate themſelves to the ſeaſons; not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that Religion propounds to a man a further end then policy points at. A Prince therefore ſhould be well aware of ſuch evill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, beleeving con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion hath no need of helpe from falſhood, nor can gain any ſtrength by lies.</note> are and underſtand the cauſes of natural things. And becauſe this courſe hath been taken by many wiſe men, hence grew the opinion of miracles

which are celebrated even in falſe Religions; for wiſe men augment them what beginning ſo ever they have, and their authority after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards gives them cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit. Of theſe mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles there was great quantity at <hi>Rome:</hi> and among others there was this one; the <hi>Roman</hi> ſoldiers ſacking the <hi>Vejentes</hi> City, ſome of them went into the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Juno,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to her image ask'd her, wilt thou go to <hi>Rome?</hi> ſome thought ſhe nodded, another thought ſhe ſaid, yes.

Which Religion if it were maintained among the Princes of the Chriſtian Republick according as by the inſtitutor there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it was ordain'd, the Chriſtian States and Republicks would be far more in unity, and enjoy more happineſs far then now they do: nor does any thing give us ſo ſhrewd a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture of the declining of it, as to ſee, that thoſe people that are neereſt neighbours to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> head of our Religion, are the moſt inreligious. And whoſoever would well conſider the original grounds thereof, and look upon the preſent uſe how much this differs from thoſe, without queſtion he would judge the ruine or ſcourge thereof were near at hand. And becauſe ſome are of opinion, that the welfare of <hi>Italy</hi> depends upon the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet the contrary might ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be proved, conſidering thoſe that in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> obſerve not the precepts they ought, but rather adulterate the holy and Catholick Ordinances which were wont to be kept. Moreover this comes to paſs, becauſe the Church hath alwaies held, and ſtill holds this Country divided: and truly never was any Province either united or happy, unleſs it were wholly reduc'd to the obedience of one Commonwealth, or Prince; as it befel <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi> And the cauſe that <hi>Italy</hi> is not in the ſame terms, nor hath not one Republick or one Prince to govern it, is only the Church; for having inhabited there and held the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

never ſo weak, that for fear of loſing the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral dominion it could not call in a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full friend to defend it againſt him that were grown too puiſſant in <hi>Italy;</hi> as anciently it hath been ſeen by ſundry experiences, when by means of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great it drove out the <hi>Lombards,</hi> who had as it were the abſolute power of all <hi>Italy;</hi> and when in our daies it took the <hi>Venetians</hi> power from them by the <hi>Frenchmens</hi> ayd, and afterwards chaſed away the <hi>French</hi> by help of the <hi>Swiſſes.</hi> Therefore the Church being not powerfull to ſubdue all <hi>Italy</hi> it ſelf, nor yet ſuffering any other to maſter it, hath been the cauſe, that it could never be brought to have but one head; but hath alwaies been under more Princes and Lords; whereupon is grown ſuch a diſunion, and ſo much weakneſs, that <hi>Italy</hi> hath been made aſprey not only of powerfull <hi>Barbarians,</hi> but of any the next aſſaylant.

And though many there are in <hi>T. Livius,</hi> yet I will content my ſelf with theſe. The people of <hi>Rome</hi> having created their Tribunes of Conſular power, and except one, all <hi>Plebei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and it falling out that year, that there was peſtilence and famine, and certain other prodigies, the Nobility of <hi>Rome</hi> took hold of this occaſion, at the Tribunes new creation, to ſay that the Gods were angry, becauſe <hi>Rome</hi> had abus'd the Majeſty of their Empire, and that they had no other means to appeaſe them, then to reduce the election of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes to the former courſe. Whence it came, that the people frighted by this ſuperſtition made the Tribunes all of the Nobility. The like was alſo in their Conqueſt of the <hi>Vejentes</hi> City, that the Commanders of their Armies did ſerve themſelves of the Religion, to keep them in heart for any enterpriſe: for that year the <hi>Albanilak</hi> being miraculouſly ſweld, and the <hi>Roman</hi> Soldiers weari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And ſo the accuſtomed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion help'd well, both for the taking in of that Town, and for the reſtitution of the Tribunſhip to the Nobility; for without the ayde thereof, the one or the other had hardly had their ſucceſs. And this other example I muſt alſo add to this purpoſe. There were in <hi>Rome</hi> a great many tumults rais'd upon the occaſion of <hi>Terentillus</hi> a Tribune, he deſiring to make a law, for cauſes which hereafter we ſhall declare in their place. Among the firſt remedies which the Nobility ſerv'd themſelves of, was the Religion, whereof they made uſe two waies: In the firſt, they made the Sibill's books be ſearcht, and anſwer as it were to the City, that by means of civill diſcord they ſhould hazzard the loſs of their liberty that year: which thing, though the Tribunes had herein diſcover'd their ſubtilty, yet it ſo frigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the people, that it quite took off their eagerneſs in the purſuit. The other way was, that when <hi>Appius Herdonius</hi> with a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of outlaws, and ſlaves, near upon four thouſand men, having poſſeſs'd themſelves by right of the Capitoll, ſo that it might be fear'd that if the <hi>Aequi</hi> or <hi>Volſci,</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> ſworn enemies, had approacht the Town, they might have taken it: the Tribunes not forbearing for all this to continue in their obſtinacy, and to enact the law made by <hi>Terentillus,</hi> ſaying
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:30490:45"/>
this aſſault of their; feigned, and not true, one <hi>Puhlius Valerius</hi> a grave citizen, and of good authority, went out of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and told them partly in friendly termes, and partly in threatning, the dangers in which the City ſtood, and the unſeaſonableneſs of their demand, and thereby brought the people to ſwear, they would not forſake the Conſuls command. Whereupon the people being return'd to obedience, recover'd the Capitoll by force. But the Conſul <hi>Publius Valerius</hi> being ſlain in this conflict, there was forthwith another Conſul made, one <hi>Titus Quintius,</hi> who to keep the people from idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and to give no ſpace to think again of <hi>Terentillus</hi> his law, commanded them to go forth of <hi>Rome</hi> with him againſt the <hi>Volſci,</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that by the oath they had taken not to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon the Conſul, they were bound to follow him; whereunto the Tribunes oppos'd, ſaying, that oath was made to the Conſul now ſlain, not to him. Yet <hi>Titus Livius</hi> ſhews that the people in awfulneſs to their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion world rather obey the Conſul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>THe Soothſayings were not only (as before we have discours'd) for the moſt part, the ground of the Gentiles ancient Religion, but they were alſo the occaſions of the <hi>Roman</hi> Republiques welfare.

from it: but, they turn'd and woond it with ſuch terms and faſhions ſo properly, that it appear'd, they did it not with an contempt of Religion. Which courſe was us'd once in a fight, by <hi>Papirius</hi> the Conſull, which he had (of great importance) with the <hi>Samnites,</hi> after which they were much worn and broken. For <hi>Papirius</hi> encountring with the <hi>Samnites,</hi> and perceiving in the skirmiſh that the victory was ſure, had a mind hereupon to fight a full battell, and therefore commanded the <hi>Pollarij,</hi> they ſhould make their conjectures; but the Chickens not Pecking, and the chief ſoothſayer ſeeing the forwardneſs of the army to fight, and the opinion the General and all the ſoldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers had of the victory, that he might not take away the occaſion of well doing from the army ſent back to the Conſull, that the ſoothſayers anſwer'd well; ſo that while <hi>Papirius</hi> was ordering his ſquadrons, ſome of the <hi>Pollarij</hi> having told certain ſoldiers, that the Chickens had not peckt, they told it to <hi>Spurius Papirius</hi> the Conſulls nephew, and he again to the Conſul; whereto he ſuddenly reply'd, that he ſhould take a care to perform his own duty well, and that for himſelf and the army the conjectures were faire; and if the Soothſayer had told lyes, it would turn to his own loſs: and that in effect it ſhould ſucceed according to his prognoſtication, he commanded the L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Whereupon it chanc't that going forward againſt their enemies, one of the <hi>Roman</hi> Soldiers threw a dart, and as it hap'd, ſlew a principal Soothſayer: which being come to the Conſuls eare, he ſaid that all things went forward luckily, and with the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:30490:47"/>
Gods favour, for the Army by the death of that lyer was purg'd of all crime, and excus'd of the wrath conceiv'd againſt them. And thus by knowing how to accommodate his deſigns to the divinations, he choſe to fight, the Army never perceiving that he had any whit neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected the rites of their Religion. <hi>Appius Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher</hi> went a contrary courſe to this, in <hi>Sicily,</hi> in the firſt <hi>Carthaginian</hi> wars; who deſirous to fight with the enemy, caus'd the <hi>Pollarij</hi> to make their divinations; and they anſwering that the Chickens did not feed, he ſaid, let us ſee then if they will drink, and ſo made them be thrown into the ſea, and then fighting, loſt the day.

And becauſe they knew the obſtinacy of the ſoldiers minds would help the victory well forward, and to induce them hereto, there was no better means then Religion, they advis'd to renew an old ſacrifice of theirs by the help of <hi>Ovius Pattius</hi> their Prieſt: which they order'd in this manner; the folemn ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice being made, and amidſt the ſlain beaſts, and the altars ſet on fire, having caus'd the chief of the Army to ſwear never to forſake the fight, they cal'd the ſoldiers one by one, and in the midſt of thoſe altars enclos'd by many Centurions with their fwords drawn, firſt they made them ſwear, they ſhould not diſcloſe any thing they either heard or ſaw: afterwards with words of execration, and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:30490:48"/>
verſes full of horrour made them vow and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to the Gods, to be ready in whatſoever their General ſhould command, never to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon the fight, and kill whomſoever they ſaw fly; which if they fail'd in, might it light upon their family and kindred. And ſome of them being amaz'd, and refuſing to ſwear, were preſently ſlain by their Centurions, ſo that the reſt that followed them, frighted by the ſierceneſs of the ſpectacle, ſwore all. And to augment the magnificence of their meeting, being ſixty thouſand men, half of them were clad with white cloth, with plumes and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers upon their helmets, and thus arrai'd they incamp'd themſelves at <hi>Aquilonia.</hi> Againſt theſe came <hi>Papirius,</hi> who in his ſpeech to incourage his ſoldiers, ſaid, <hi>Surely their plumes could make no wounds,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Non enim criſtas vulnera facere, &amp; picta atque aura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta ſcuta tranſire Romanum palum.</note> 
                        <hi>nor their painted and golden ſhields defend the blows of the</hi> Roman <hi>Pikes.</hi> And to take away the doubt his ſoldiers had of their enemies becauſe of the oath taken, ſaid, it was rather a diſcouragement to them then other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; for they were afraid of their own people, the Gods, and their enemies. And when they came to the fight, the <hi>Samnites</hi> were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown, for the <hi>Roman</hi> vertue, and the feare conceiv'd by reaſon of their former loſſes, overcame what ever obſtinacy they could have reſolv'd on by force of their Religion or oath taken. Yet it is plain, how they thought they could have no other refuge, nor try other remedy, that could give them hope to recover their loſt vertue. Which fully ſhewes, how great confidence Religion well us'd can give. And though haply this

                        <p>People accuſtomed to live under a Prince, if by any accident they become free, have much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe to maintain their liberty.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>HOW hard it is for a people, us'd to live, in ſubjection to a Prince, afterwards to maintain their liberty, if by any accident they get it, as <hi>Rome</hi> did upon the <hi>Tarquins</hi> baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, very many examples ſhew us, which we read in the memorialls of ancient hiſtories. And not without good reaſon: for the people is nothing different from a brute beaſt, which (though fierce of nature and wilde) hath been bred alwaies in a den and under com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; and though by ehance it hath got looſe into the fields, yet not being uſed to ſeek the ſood, nor being acquainted with the coverts, where to hide itſelf, becomes the prey of the firſt that ſeeks to take it, The ſelf-ſame thing befalls a people uſed to live under the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of others; the which not having know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg to treat of publick deſences or offences, not knowing the neighbour Princes, nor yet known by them, quickly returns under the yoke, which oftentimes is heavier, then that which before was taken from their neck;
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:30490:49"/>
and they come to fall into theſe difficulties, though as yet there be not entred among them much diſorder. For a people that is quite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch'd cannot for a little while, no not a whit, enjoy their liberty, as it ſhall after appear. And therefore our ſpeeches are not of thoſe people, where corruption is overgrown, but where there is more good then naught. To this former we may add another difficulty, which is, that the State that becomes free, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures enemies that ſide againſt it, and not friends to ſide with it. Thoſe hold together as ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, who got advantages by the tyrannical government, feeding upon the Princes riches whereby they uſed to help themſelves, which being now taken from them, they cannot reſt content, but every one is neceſſitated to try if he can again recall the Royalty, that ſo they may recover their former advancements. They get not, as I have ſaid, friends to ſide with them; for the free government propounds honours and rewards upon ſome worthy and determinated occaſions, otherwiſe it rewards none, nor honours none. And when a man hath received thoſe honours and thoſe advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, which he thinks, he deſerv'd; he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges no obligation to them that reward him. Moreover, that common good which men reap of free government, is not known by any, while it is poſſeſt; which is, to injoy freely ones own without ſuſpicion, not to doubt of his wives or daughters honours, not to be in fear for his ſons, or for himſelf. For no man thinks himſelf beholding to one that offends him not. And therefore if they come to have a free State, as it is above mentioned, there ariſe thoſe that will be partiſans againſt
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:30490:49"/>
them, and not ſide with them: and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe a remedy for theſe inconvenients and diſorders, which theſe difficulties might bring us, there is none more potent, nor ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, nor neceſſary, than to kill <hi>Brutus</hi> his ſonns, who as the Story ſhews, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd together with other young <hi>Romans,</hi> to conſpire againſt their native country, for no other reaſon, than becauſe they could not ſo extraordinarily advantage themſelves under the Conſuls, as under the Kings; ſo that they thought the peoples liberty was become their ſlavery. And he that undertakes to govern a multitude either by way of liberty, or by way of Principality, and aſſures not himſelf of thoſe that are enemies to his new State, is not like to continue long. True it is, that I judge thoſe Princes very unfortunate, who to ſecure their dominions are to go extravagant waies, having the vaſt multitude for their enemies: for he that hath but few enemies, eaſily and without many offences ſecures himſelf; but he that hath the univerſality againſt him, is never out of jealouſie; and the more cruelty he uſes, the weaker becomes his power. So that the greateſt remedy he hath, is to make the people friendly. And though this diſcourſe be diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the former, treating here of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding good Prince, and there of a Republick, yet that I may not return here often upon this occaſion, I ſhall ſay ſomewhat of it, but briefly. And therefore if a Prince would gain the good will of a people, that was enemy to him (ſpeaking of thoſe Princes, that are become Tyrants of their native coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try) I ſay, he ought to examine firſt, what the people deſire; and he ſhall alwaies find, that
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:30490:50"/>
they deſire two things; the one, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd of him that occaſion'd their ſlavery; the other, to have their liberty reſtor'd. To the firſt, the Prince can ſatisfie in whole, to the ſecond in part. As for the firſt, there is an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to the point. <hi>Clearchus</hi> a Tyrant of <hi>Heraclea</hi> being in baniſhment, it happen'd that upon a difference riſen between the people and the nobility of <hi>Heraclea,</hi> that the nobility, finding themſelves too weak, turn'd to favour <hi>Clearchus,</hi> and conſpiring with him, againſt the will of the people, let him into the Town, and took away the peoples liberty; ſo that <hi>Clearchus</hi> being in a ſtreight between the inſolence of the nobility, whom he could not any way content, nor rectify, and the rage of the people, that could not indure thus to have loſt their liberty, reſolv'd in one, to free himſelf of the importunity of the Nobles, and withall to gain the people. And to this purpoſe having taken a convenient opportunity, cut in pieces all the Nobility, to the peoples great ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, And thus he ſatlsfy'd one of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires the people have, that is, to be reveng'd. But as for the peoples other deſire, to recover their liberty, if the Prince cannot ſatisfy them, let him examine, what are the reaſons make them deſire ſreedom, and he ſhall find, there is but a ſmall number of them would be free, to command. But all the reſt, which are the many, deſire liberty to life ſecurely. For in all Republicks of what manner ſoever or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, not above forty or fifty Citizens at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the degrees of authority: and becauſe theſe are but few, it is an eaſie thing to be ſure of them, either by taking them out of the way, or by letting them ſhare of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:30490:50"/>
ſuch honours, as agree to their conditions, which they may very well be contented with. Thoſe others, whom it ſuffices, If they can live ſecurely, are eaſily ſatisfied by making ordinances and laws, wherewith together with his power, he may comprehend their ſafety in general. And when a Prince does this, and that the people perceive it, that by no accident he breaks thoſe laws, they will begin in a ſhort time to live ſecure and content. Wee have an example of the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> which continues not in quiet by other means, than that their Kings are tyed to many laws, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſecurity of all his people is containd. And he that was the founder of that State, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd, that the Kings ſhould diſpoſe of the wars and the moneys at their pleaſures, but with all other matters they had nothing to do, but they were at the laws appointment. That Prince therefore or Republick, which ſecures not themſelves at their entrance into the government, ought at leaſt take hold of the firſt occaſion, as the <hi>Romans</hi> did. He that lets that paſs, repents himſelf too late, of not having done what he ſhould. The people of <hi>Rome</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not as yet debauch't, when they recovered their liberty, might well maintain it, when <hi>Brutus</hi> his ſonnes were ſlain, and the <hi>Tarquins</hi> dead, by thoſe remedies, and orders, which we have at ſeveral times recounted. But had the people been corrupted, neither in <hi>Rome,</hi> nor any where elſe, could they have found means ſtrong enough to preſerve it, as in the Chapter ſollowing we ſhall ſhew.</p>

                        <p>A diſorderly people, getting their liberty, cannot keep themſelves free without very great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>I think it neceſſarily true, that either the Kings were to be expelled out of <hi>Rome,</hi> or elſe <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf would have grown feeble and of no worth; for conſidering how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly the Kings were corrupted, if after that rate two or three ſucceſſions had follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that corruption that was in them had diſtended it ſelf throughout the members, ſo that they likewiſe had received of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, it had been impoſſible ever to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed it. But loſing the head when the body was ſound, it might eaſily be reduced to a free and orderly government. And this ſhould be preſuppoſed for certain, that a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucht City living under a Prince, though that Prince with all his ſtock be rooted out, yet can it not become free, but rather fall ſtill into the hands of new Lords, who continually make an end one of another. And without the creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſome new Prince, they ſhall never have an end, unleſs he by his goodneſs and valour main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them free. But their liberty is of no longer conyinuance than his life, as was that o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Syracuſa</hi> for <hi>Dions</hi> and <hi>Timoelons</hi> lives: whoſe vertues in ſeveral times, while they liv'd kept that City free; ſo ſoon as they were dead, it fell into the former ſervitude, We find not a braver example then that of <hi>Rome,</hi> which upon the <hi>Tarquins</hi> baniſhments, could preſently
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:30490:51"/>
lay hold off, and maintaine that liberty. But <hi>Caeſar</hi> being ſlain, <hi>C. Caligula, Nero,</hi> and the whole race of the <hi>Caeſars</hi> blotted out, it could not, not onely keep, no not ſo much as give a beginning to their liberty. Neither did ſo great variety of accidents in one and the ſame citie proceed from other, than that, when the <hi>Tarquins</hi> were expell'd, the people of Rome were not toucht with this corruption, and in theſe latter times they were throughly infected. For then to ſettle their mindes in a reſolution againſt Kings, it was enough to take an oath of them, that never any King ſhould raigne at Rome. But in the after ages, the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and ſeverity of <hi>Brutus,</hi> with all the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entall Regions, were not of force to hold them in diſpoſition to maintain that Liberty, which he like the firſt <hi>Brutus</hi> had reſtored them. Which ſprung from that corruption, which <hi>Marius</hi> his faction ſpread among the people; whereof <hi>Caeſar</hi> coming to be the Chiefe, could ſo blind that multitude, that they could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the yoke, which he himſelf put on their neck. And though this example of Rome be better than any other, yet will I alleadge to this purpoſe, ſome people known in our dayes. And therefore I ſay, that no meanes could ever bring <hi>Milan</hi> or <hi>Naples</hi> to their free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, by reaſon of the infection of all their members. Which appeared after the death of <hi>Philip Viſconti,</hi> when <hi>Milan</hi> deſiring to recover her liberty, neither was able, nor knew how to keepe it. Yet that of Rome was a great hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, that their Kings grow naught ſuddenly, that they were baniſht, and that before the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection was gone down into the bowels of that Citie, which was the occaſion that thoſe
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:30490:52"/>
many tumults, which were raiſed in Rome (men doing it to a good end) did not hurt, but help the Commonwealth. And we may make this concluſion, that where the matter is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, lawes, though well made, profit little, unleſs they have ſuch a maker, that with ſtrong hand forces obedience to them, till the matter become good: which, whether it hath ever happened, I know not, or whether it be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible it can happen: for it is plain, as a little before I ſaid, that a City declining by corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of matter, if ever it chances to riſe again, it is meerly by the vertue of one man, who is then living, and not by the vertue of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality, that keepes the good lawes in force: and ſuddenly when that man is dead, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes to the old guiſe, as it came to paſs at <hi>Thebes,</hi> which, by the vertue of <hi>Epaminondas</hi> while he liv'd, could ſubſiſt in forme of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique and government, but he being gone, it fell into the former diſorders. The reaſon is, becauſe a man cannot live ſo long a time as is ſufficient to diſaccuſtome them to the ill, and accuſtome them throughly to the good. And if one man of a very long life, or two ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Governors ſucceſſively continued, do not diſpoſe of them to good, when one of them failes, as I have ſaid before, they are preſently ruined, unleſs the other with many dangers, and much bloudſhed recover them out of deſtruction. For that corruption and unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for freedome, ariſes from an inequality, that is in the City: and if a man would reduce it to equality, he muſt uſe many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary wayes, which few know or will ſerve themſelves of, as other where more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly ſhall be ſaid.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>In what manner in a corrupted City a free ſtate may be maintained, being gotten; or how when they have it not, it may be gotten, and well order'd.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>I Thinke, it will not be out of the way, nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeing to the former diſcourſe, to conſider whether in a City diſordered, a free State can be preſerv'd, that being there a ſoot already; or not being there, how it may be attain'd, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to good order. Whereupon, <hi>I</hi> ſay, that it is very hard to do the one or the other: and though it be almoſt impoſſible to give a ſtrict rule thereof (becauſe we ſhould neceſſarily proceed according to the degrees of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption) yet it not being unfit to reaſon of every thing, I ſhall not let this paſs. And I preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a city corrupted in extremity, from whence I ſhall come more to augment ſuch a difficulty, becauſe there are no lawes nor ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances ſufficient to bridle a univerſall corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For as there is need of lawes, to preſerve good cuſtomes; ſo, to have the lawes well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, there is need of good cuſtomes. Beſides this, the ordinances and lawes made in a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique at birth thereof, when men were good, ſerve not to purpoſe afterwards, when once they are growne vicious. And if the lawes vary being accommodated according to the accidents, ſeldome or never vary the old orders of the city: which makes that the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:30490:53"/>
new lawes ſuffice nor, becauſe the orders that continue in force do corrupt. And to lay this part more plain to the underſtanding, I ſay, that in Rome there was the order of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or rather of the ſtates, and the lawes afterwards which together with the Magiſtrates did bridle the Citizens. The order of the ſtate was the authority of the people, of the Senate, of the Tribuns, and of the Conſuls the manner of demanding or creating of Magiſtrates and the manner of making lawes. Theſe orders little or nothing did they vary among the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens; the lawes varied which bridled the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, as did that law againſt adulteries, againſt expences, againſt ambition, and many others, according as by degrees the citizens grew cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted. But the orders of ſtate ſtanding ſted. faſt, which in the time of corruption were no longer good, thoſe lawes which were renew'd again, were not of force to keep men good, but would have been well helpt, if when the lawes were renew'd, the orders alſo had bin chang'd. And that it is true that ſuch orders in a corrupted city were not good, it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſeen in two principal heads. As for the creation of Magiſtrates, and making lawes, he people of Rome gave the Conſulate and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prime degrees of the city, onely to thoſe that ſued for them. This order was in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning good, becauſe none ſtood for them, but thoſe citizens that eſteem'd themſelves worthy of them, and to receive the repulſe was a ſhame; ſo that to be thought worthy, every one did well. But this way afterwards in a corrupted City proov'd very hurtfull; for not the beſt deſerving men, but the moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, ſued for the magiſtracy, and thoſe of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:30490:53"/>
ſmall power (howſoever vertuous) forbore to demand them for fear.</p>
                     <p>It came not to this inconvenient, at once, but by degrees, as men fall into all other inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nients. For the Romans having brought under Affrica, and Aſia, and reduc'd well nigh all Greece to their obedience, doubted no way of their liberty, and thought they had no more enemies could ſcare them. Thus farre their ſecurity, and the weakneſs of their enemies workt, that the people of Rome in beſtowing the Conſulate, regarded not vertue ſo much as favour, raiſing to that dignity thoſe that could make moſt friends, not thoſe that knew beſt how to ſubdue their enemies. After, from thoſe that had moſt favour, they fell to give them to thoſe that had moſt power. So that the good, by reaſon of the defect of this order, were quite excluded. A Tribun of the people and any other Citizen might propound a law to the people, and thereupon every Citizen had the liberty to ſpeak either in favour of it, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, before it were determin'd of. This order was commendable, while the integrity of the Citizens held: for it was alwayes well, that every one may give his opinion thereupon, that the people, having heard every one, may after make choyce of the beſt. But the Citizens being grown miſchievous, this order became naught; for thoſe that were powerfull onely propounded lawes, not for the common good, but to advance their own powers, and againſt thoſe dar'd none to ſpeak, for fear of theſe. So that the people was brought either by falſhood or force to determine their own ruine. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was neceſſary, to the end that Rome in her corrupted age ſhould maintaine her liberty,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:30490:54"/>
that as in the progreſs of her life ſhe had made new lawes, ſo ſhould ſhe have made new or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: for other orders and other manners of living ought to be ordain'd in a good ſubject, and others in a bad; nor can the forme be like, where the matter is quite contrarily diſpos'd. But theſe orders are either to be renewed all of a ſudden when they are diſcovered to be no longer good, or elſe by little and little, when their defaults be taken notice of by every one: I ſay, that either the one or the other of theſe two things are almoſt impoſſible. For to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new them by degrees, it is fit a very wiſe man ſhould be the cauſe of it, who ſhould foreſee this inconvenient afarre off: and when any of theſe ariſe, it is a very likely thing that none of theſe men ſtep forth; and when they ſhould they would never be able to perſwade another what they eonceiv'd; becauſe men accuſtomed alwaies to live in one manner, will not alter it; and the rather not ſeeing that evill preſent, which is to be ſhew'd by conjectures. Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the innovation of theſe orders on a ſudden when every one knowes they are not good; I ſay, that this unprofitableneſs, which is eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knowne, is hard to correct; for to effect this ordinary meanes ſerve not, they being rather hurtfull; but of neceſſity extraordinary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies are to be put in practiſe, as violence and war; and in any caſe ought a man ſtrive to become prince of that city that he may have power to order it at his pleaſure. And becauſe the reſtoring of a city to a politique and a civil government, preſuppoſes a good man; and by violence to become Prince of a Commonwealth preſuppoſes an evil man, for this cauſe it ſhall very ſeldome come to paſs, that a good man will
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:30490:54"/>
ever ſtrive to make himſelf Prince by mifchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous wayes, although his ends therein be all good; nor will a wicked man by wicked meanes attaining to be Prince, do good; nor ever comes it into his heart to uſe that authority well, which by evil meanes he came to. From all theſe things above written ariſes the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty or impoſſibility, that is in corrupted cities, theree to maintaine a Republique, or to create one anew. And when it were to be created or maintained, it were fitteſt to reduce it rather towards a popular ſtate; to the end that thoſe men, who by reaſon of their inſolence cannot be amended by the lawes, might in ſome man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner be reſtrained as it were by a regall power. And to conſtraine them by any other way to become good, would either be a moſt cruel attempt, or altogether impoſſible: As I ſaid before, that <hi>Cleomenes</hi> did, who that he might command alone flew the <hi>Ephores;</hi> and if <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus</hi> for the ſame reaſons ſlew his brother, and <hi>Titus Tatius</hi> the <hi>Sabine,</hi> but afterwards excer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed very vertuouſly their authority: yet it is to be noted that neither the one nor the other of them had the ſubject ſtaind with that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, whereof we have diſcourſed in this Chapter: and therefore they might intend well; and when they did not, give colour to a bad deſigne with a good ſucceſs.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>A very mean Prince may eaſily ſubſiſt, ſucceeding a brave and valourous Prince: but a mean one following a mean, brings a State into great hazzard.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>WHen we conſider the valour, and the manner of <hi>Romulus, Numa,</hi> and <hi>Tullus</hi> proceedings, the firſt <hi>Roman</hi> Kings, we ſhall find, that <hi>Rome</hi> hit upon a very great fortune, having the firſt King fierce and warlick, the ſecond peaceable and religious, the third of like courage to <hi>Romulus,</hi> and a lover of war rather then peace. For in <hi>Rome</hi> it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that in her infancy there ſhould ariſe ſome one to order her in the eourſe of civill government; but in like manner it was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards needfull that the other Kings ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take themſelves again to <hi>Romulus</hi> his valour, otherwiſe that City would have become effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate, and been prey'd on by her neighbours. Whence we may obſerve, that the ſucceſſor, though not of ſo great valour as the prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour, is able to maintain a State by the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of him that hath govern'd it before, and enjoy the fruits of his labour: but if it come to paſs, either that he be of long life or that after him there follows no other of like valour as the firſt, of neceſſity that kingdom muſt go to ruine. So on the contrary, if two of great valour ſucceſſively follow one the other, it is often ſeen, they effect mighty things, and eternize their names. <hi>David</hi> was a man for armes, for learning and judgement excellent:
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:30490:55"/>
and ſuch was his valour, that having over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and ſubdued his neighbours, he left his ſon <hi>Solomen</hi> a peaceable Kingdom, which he might well maintain by peacefull meanes, without any war, and happily poſſeſs the fruits of his fathers vertue. But he could not leave it now to <hi>Roboam</hi> his ſonn, who not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling his Grandfather in vertue, nor ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the like good hap his father had, with much adoe remain'd heire to the ſixth part of the Kingdom. <hi>Bajazet</hi> the Turkiſh Sultan, although he gave himſelf rather to peace then war, yet could he alſo enjoy his father <hi>Mahomets</hi> labors; who having as <hi>David</hi> beaten all his neighbours left him a ſetled Kingdom, eaſie to be continued by peace: but if his ſonn <hi>Selimus,</hi> now raigning, had reſembled the Father and not the Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, that Kingdom had gone to wrack. But we ſee this man like to outgoe his Grandfathers glory. Whereupon I agree with theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, that after an excellent Prince a feeble one may ſubſiſt, but after one feeble one a Kingdom cannot ſtand with another, unleſs it be ſuch a one as <hi>France,</hi> which ſubſiſts by force of her ancient ordinances. And thoſe are weak Princes, that are not in the exerciſe of war. And therefore I conclude with this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, that ſuch was <hi>Romulus</hi> his valour, that it could give ſpace to <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> for many years by peacefull means to govern <hi>Rome.</hi> But him followed <hi>Tullus,</hi> who by his courage recover'd <hi>Romu'us</hi> reputation: after him came <hi>Ancus,</hi> ſo endowed by nature, that he knew how to uſe peace, and ſupport war. And firſt he addreſt himſelf in a peaceable way; but preſently when he knew that his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, thinking him eſſeminate, undervalu'd
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:30490:56"/>
him, he conſider'd that to maintain <hi>Rome,</hi> he was to apply himſelf to the warres, and rather follow <hi>Romulus</hi> his ſteps, than <hi>Numas.</hi> Hence let all Princes, that hold a State, take ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, that he that reſembles <hi>Numa,</hi> ſhall either keep it or loſe it, as the times prove, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes wheele turns; but he that takes after <hi>Romulus,</hi> arm'd as he with wiſdom and force, ſhall hold it in any caſe, unleſs by an obſtinate and overmighty power it be wreſted from him. And certainly we may well think, if <hi>Rome</hi> had light upon a man, for her third King, who knew not how by armes to recover her repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, ſhe could never afterwards, or not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much adoe, have taken root, or attain'd that grow'th ſhe after grew to. And thus whiles ſhe liv'd under the Kings, ſhe ran the hazzard of ruining under a weake or naughty King.</p>

                     <p>AFter <hi>Rome</hi> had baniſht her Kings, ſhe was deliver'd of thoſe dangers which, as is before ſaid, ſhe hazzarded, a feeble or naughty King ſucceeding in her.

Whereof we have a very late example: For every one knows, how of late daies the King of <hi>England</hi> aſſayl'd the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> and took no other ſoldiers than his own people. And by reaſon that Kingdom had not been at war a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove thirty years before, it had neither ſoldier nor Captain that ever had been at war; yet he nothing doubted with thoſe to ſet upon a Kingdom furniſht with Captains and good Armies, who had continually born armes in the warrs of <hi>Italy.</hi> All this proceeded from that this King was a very wiſe man, and that Kingdom well govern'd; which in time of peace neglected not military diſcipline. <hi>Pelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidas</hi> and <hi>Epaminondas, Thebans,</hi> after they had ſet <hi>Thebes</hi> at liberty, and drawn her out of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of the <hi>Spartan</hi> government, perceiving well they were in a City accuſtomed to ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and in the midſt of eſſeminate people, yet made no difficulty (ſuch was their vertue) to train them up in arms, and with thoſe to go and meet the <hi>Spartan</hi> Armies in the field, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them. And he that makes relation of it, ſaies, that theſe two prov'd in ſhort time, that not only in <hi>Lacedemon</hi> ſoldiers were bred, but in any other place where men are bred, if they found any could train them in the exerciſe. As it appears that <hi>Tullus</hi> knew how to train them to the war. And <hi>Virgill</hi> could not better expreſs this opinion, nor with other words come near it, where he ſaies:</p>

                     <p>TULLUS the <hi>Roman</hi> King and <hi>Metius</hi> the <hi>Alban</hi> made an agreement, that that people ſhould be Lord of the other, whoſe three, above mentioned, champions vanquiſht the others. All the <hi>Curiatij, Albans,</hi> were ſlain; there remain'd alive onely one of the <hi>Horatij, Romans;</hi> and by this, <hi>Metius</hi> King of the <hi>Albans</hi> with his people became ſubject to the <hi>Romans.</hi> And this <hi>Horatius</hi> the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour returning into <hi>Rome,</hi> and meeting one of his own ſiſters, who had been married to one of the three dead <hi>Curiatij,</hi> that lamented the death of her husband, ſlew her.

One, that the whole fortune of the State ought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be hazzarded with a part of the forces. The other, that in a City well govern'd faults be never made amends for with deſerts: The third, that matches were never wiſely made, where a man-ought or can doubt the performance will not follow. For ſo much imports it a City to become ſubject, that a
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:30490:58"/>
man ought not beleeve, that any of thoſe Kings or people would reſt content, that three of their fellow citizens ſhould have brought them to this yoke; of which mind we ſaw <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> was: who, though preſently after the Romans victory, he acknowleg'd himſelf vanquiſht, and promis'd obedience to <hi>Tullus,</hi> yet in the firſt expedition they were to meet againſt the Vejentes, it appear'd, how he ſought to deceive him; as he, that was too late aware of his raſhneſs in the bargain he made.

                        <p>That the whole fortune ought not be laid at ſtake, where the whole forces try not for it: and for this cauſe it is often hurtfull to guard the paſſages.</p>

                        </gap>ſt, upon leſs then the ſtrength of his whole game: And this is done divers waies. One is, doing as <hi>Tullus</hi> and <hi>Metius</hi> did, when they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the whole fortune of their countrey, and the valour of ſo many men as the one and the other had in their armies, to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>four and fortune of three of their citizens, which were but a very ſmall part of either of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Nor did they conſider, how by this adventure all the toyle their anceſtors had taken in ordering the Commonwealth
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:30490:58"/>
ſo, that it might long continue free, and to make the citizens defenders of their liberty, was all in vain, it being left in the hands of ſo few to loſe it. Which thing thoſe Kings could not have known how more to have undervalued. And for the moſt part they like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe fall into the ſame inconvenient, who (upon the enemies approach) intend to keep the hard places and guard the paſſages. For this reſolution will alwayes be hurtfull, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in that hard paſſage thou canſt bring to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether all thy whole forces. And in ſuch caſe, this courſe may be well taken. But the place being rough, and it not being poſſible to hold all thy forces there, there is loſs in it. And to judge thus I am perſwaded by the example I finde of thoſe, that when they are aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a powerfull enemy, their country being environed with mountaines and rocky places, have never endeavoured to fight with the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my upon the paſſages or mountaines, but have gone beyond to encounter them: or when they would not do this, they have expected them among the mountains, in plain and eaſy places and not mountainous; and the reaſon thereof hath been given before. For it is not poſſible to bring many men together to the guard of mountainous places, becauſe proviſions for long time cannot eaſily be furniſh'd, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the paſſages are ſtreight and capable of few, and therefore not poſſible to withſtand an enemy preſſing on with the groſs of his army. And it is an eaſy thing for the enemy to come on with his groſs; becauſe his intention is but to paſs on, and not to ſtay. And it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for him that awaits him, to await in groſs, having to lodge there for a lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:30490:59"/>
time, not knowing when the enemy wiil paſs in places (as I ſaid) ſtreight and barren. Looſing therefore that paſſage which thou hadſt intended to keep, and wherein thy people and thy army repos'd ſome truſt, moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly there enters ſuch a terror into the reſt of thy people, that without any means to make trial of their valor, thou art left the loſer, and with part of thy forces thou haſt loſt all thy fortunes. Every one knows with what difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>Anniball</hi> paſt the <hi>Alpes,</hi> which divides <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardy</hi> from <hi>France,</hi> and thoſe, which divide <hi>Lombardy</hi> from <hi>Tuſcany;</hi> yet the <hi>Romans</hi> firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected him upon the <hi>Teſin,</hi> and afterwards up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the plain of <hi>Arezo;</hi> and would rather have their army waſted by their enemies, in places where they might overcome, then bring it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Alpes,</hi> where likely it would have been deſtroyed by the malignity of the place. And whoſoever ſhall with diſcretion read hiſtories, ſhall find that very few expert Commanders have aſſayd to keep the like paſſages, for theſe reaſons we have ſaid; and becauſe they cannot all divide themſelves, the mountains being as open fields, and not having only ordinary and accuſtomed, but many by-waies, though not known to ſtrangers, yet to the inhabitants, by whoſe help thou ſhalt be guided any way in deſpight of the oppoſers. Whereof we can alleadg a very late example. In the year 1515 when <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt King of <hi>France</hi> intended to paſs into <hi>Italy,</hi> to recover the State of <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardy,</hi> the greateſt ground they had that diſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his enterpriſe, was, that the <hi>Swiſſes</hi> would ſtep his paſſage on the mountains, And as after experience ſhew'd it, this ground of theirs was ſlight. For that King having
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:30490:59"/>
left aſide two or three places kept by them, came from thence by another way unknown, and was ſooner in <hi>Italy</hi> then any were aware of him, So that herewith being daunted, they retir'd into <hi>Milan,</hi> and all the people of <hi>Lombardy</hi> took the <hi>French</hi> party, having fail'd in the opinion they had, that the <hi>French</hi> men would be ſtop'd on the top of the mountains.</p>

                        <p>Commonwealths well order'd appoint rewards and puniſhments for their people, and never recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence the one with the other.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THE deſerts of <hi>Horatius</hi> had been exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great, having by his valour vanquiſh'd the <hi>Curiatij.</hi> His offence was horrible, having ſlain his ſiſter. Notwithſtanding ſuch a kind of homicide ſo much diſpleas'd the <hi>Romans</hi> that it brought them to diſpute, whether they ſhould grant him his life, though his merits were ſo great and ſo freſh: Which thing, to him that looks but ſuperficially on it, would ſeem an example of popular ingratitude. Yet he that ſhall examin better, and with more conſideration inquire, what the orders of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths ought to be, ſhall rather blame that people for having abſolv'd him, then for having had a mind to condemn him. And this is the reaſon, For never any Republick in good ordrr, eancell'd the faults of their citizens with their deſerts. But having ordain'd rewards for good ſervice, and puniſhments for deſſervice, and having rewarded one when he had done well, if afterwards he commit any offence, they chaſtiſe him without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:30490:60"/>
to his former merits. And when theſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders are ſtrictly obſerv'd, a city continues long free, otherwiſe it would ſoone go to ruine. For if a man growne into great reputation for ſome notable peece of ſervice done to the ſtate, ſhould take upon him the confidence that he could without danger of puniſhment commit any offence, in a ſhort time would he become ſo unreaſonably inſolent, that the civill ſtate could no longer conſiſt. It is very neceſſary, if we would have puniſhment for offences fear'd, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to reward good deſerts, as it appeares they did at Rome. And though the Republique be but poore, and can beſtow but little, yet may the ſubject well content himſelfe with that little; for ſo even a ſmall gift beſtowd on any one, for requitall of a good, though great, ſhall finde with him that receives it an honourable and thankfull acceptance. The ſtory of <hi>Horatius Cocles</hi> is very well knowne, and that alſo of <hi>Mutius Scevola;</hi> how the one bore up the enemies upon a bridge, till it was cut off behinde him; the other burnt his owne hand, for having miſtaken, when he meant to have killed <hi>Porſena</hi> the <hi>Tuſcan</hi> King. To theſe for two ſuch notable acts was given by the publilick two acres of ground to each of them. And marke alſo the ſtory of <hi>Manlius Capitolinus.</hi> To him for having deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the Capitoll from the French, which were encamp'd before it, they who together with him were within beſieg'd gave him a ſmall meaſure of flour, which reward (according to the then preſent fortune of Rome) was large, and of ſuch a quality too, that afterwards <hi>Manlius,</hi> either moov'd by envy, or his owne ill nature, occaſion'd a ſedition in Rome, and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:30490:60"/>
ſeeking to get the people of his faction, was, without any regard had of his good deſerts, thrown headlong downe from that Capitoll which he, to his great renowne, had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deliver'd.</p>

For they generally ſatiſfy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as well with that that ſeemes to be, as that that is. Nay rather are they many times more mov'd with appearances, then truthes. And for this cauſe, the Romans knowing this neceſſity, when firſt they lived free, having in change of one King created two Conſuls, would not ſuffer them to have more then twelve Lictors, becauſe they ſhould not outgo the number of thoſe that attend on the King. Moreover, when the yearly ſacrifice was made in Rome, which could not be done without the preſence of the King, and the Romans willing that the people, by the abſence of a King, ſhould not find a lacke of any of the old ceremonies, created a head of the ſaid ſacrifice, whom they call'd the King Prieſt; who yet was lower in
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:30490:61"/>
degree, then the high Prieſt. So that this way the people was ſatisfied of that ſacrifice, and never had any occaſion by any default in it, to wiſh their Kings again reſtored. And this they all ought to obſerve, that would cancell the old manner of living in a city, and reduce it to a new and free courſe.

So that carried forward by that rage wherewith he governed all things, with his ordinary guard he put himſelf in his enemies hands, whom af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he led away with him, leaving a governor in that city, to keep it for the Church. By the wiſe men, that were with the Pope, was noted the raſhneſs of the Pope, and the baſe cowardiſe of <hi>John Pagolus;</hi> nor could they conceit, whence it came, that he did not to his perpetual renown ſuppreſs then at once his enemy, and enrich himſelf with the prey, all the Cardinalls being then with the Pope, who had the beſt of all their Jewels with them.

                     <p>From hence came the baniſhment and the death of ſo many rare men. From hence the order of the Oſteaciſme, and all other violence,

Whereof one may make a very good gueſs, by that which chanc't, after the baniſhment of the Kings, againſt <hi>Collatine,</hi> and <hi>Publius Valerius:</hi> whereof the firſt (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he had his hand in the ſetting of Rome at liberty) was baniſht, for no other occaſion, than that he was ſirnamed <hi>Tarquin.</hi> The other having onely given ſuſpicion of himſelf, by building a houſe upon the hill <hi>Celius,</hi> was like to have bin baniſht. So that we may well think (ſeeing how ſuſpicious and ſevere Rome was in theſe two things) that ſhe would have bin as ungratefull, as Athens, if, as ſhe in her infancy and before her growth, had bin ſo much wrong'd. And that I need not turn again to this ſubject of ingratitude, I ſhall ſpeak further of it in the Chapter following.</p>

                     <p>ME thinks it is not out of the purpoſe of our former matter, to diſcourſe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Prince or people give us greater exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of ingratitude. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nd the better to argue this part, I ſay, this vice of ingratitude growes either of covereouſneſs or ſuſpicion. For when a people or Prince have ſent out a Commander of theirs, in any expedition of importance, where that Commander overcoming hath gain'd a great deale of glory, that Prince or people is in like manner bound to reward him: and if in F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>w of reward he diſgraces him, or wrongs him, incited thereunto by avarice, not willing by reaſon of this coveteouſneſs, to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him, he commits an errour, without excuſe, and drawes upon himſelf everlaſting infamy. Yet are there many Princes, who offend in this kind. And <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> declares in this Sentence <note place="margin">Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clivius eſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juriae quod benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem exſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, quia gratia oneri, ultio quaeſtui habe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</note> the occaſion. <hi>It is more pleaſing to revenge an inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, then to requite a courteſy: for thanks is thought a burden, but revenge a gain.</hi> But when he rewards him not, but rather hur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s him, not through avarice, but upon ſuſpicion, then the people or Prince deſerves ſome excuſe. And of theſe ingratitudes practis'd for ſuch cauſe we read many; for that Commander who valorouſly hath gain'd his Lord a Kingdom, by conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his enemies, repleniſhing himſelf with glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and his ſouldiers with riches, of force gets ſuch reputation with his own ſoldiers, with
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:30490:64"/>
his enemies, and his Kings own ſubjects, that that victory can no wayes ſayour well to his Lord that put him in the imployment. And becauſe mens natures are ambitious, and full of ſuſpicion, and know not how to ſet limits to their fortune, it is impoſſible, but that ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion which grows in the Prince after that Commanders victory, ſhall by himſelf be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſ'd upon ſome way or terme inſolently uſ'd; ſo that the Prince cannot adviſe himſelf o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, than to provide for his own ſafety. And to this end, thinks either to put him to death, or to take away his reputation, which he hath gotten in his army, or among his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and withall diligence to ſhew, that his valour got not the victory, but rather it came by chance, or by the enemies cowardiſe, or by the direction of the other Captaines, who were together with him in that imployment. After that <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> being in <hi>Judea,</hi> was by his army declar'd Emperor, <hi>Antonius Primus,</hi> who was then with another army in <hi>Illiria,</hi> took his part, and came thence into Italy againſt <hi>Vitel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> who commanded at Rome, and valorouſly conquer'd two <hi>Vitellian</hi> armies, and made himſelf, Maſter of Rome; ſo that <hi>Mutianus</hi> ſent by <hi>Veſpanian</hi> found all already gotten by <hi>Antonius</hi> his valor, and all difficulties ſurpaſſed. The reward <hi>Antonius</hi> gain'd hereby, was, that <hi>Mutianus</hi> took away his command of the army, and by little and little made him of no authority in Rome; whereupon <hi>Antonius</hi> went away to <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> who was yet in <hi>Aſia,</hi> by whom he was ſo coldly receiv'd, that in a ſhort time depriv'd of all dignity he dyed in deſpaire. And of theſe examples ſtories are full. In our daies, every one living knows,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:30490:64"/>
with what induſtry and valour <hi>Gonſalvus Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand,</hi> warring in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> for <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragon,</hi> brought that Kingdom under his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; and how he had for reward of his conqueſt, that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> parted from <hi>Arragon,</hi> and came to <hi>Naples,</hi> and firſt diſcharged him of his command of ſoldiers, afterwards took from him the fortreſſes, and then brought him away with him into <hi>Spain,</hi> where a while after he dyed in diſgrace. Therefore this ſuſpicion is ſo natural in Princes, that they cannot eſcape it; and it is impoſſible they prove thankfull to thoſe, who by victory have under their banners made great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts. And from that which a Prince is not free, 'tis no marvaile, nor a thing wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of greater note, that a people is not free. For a city living free hath two ends, the one to gain, the other to keep it ſelf free; and it cannot be, but in the one or the other by exceſs of love it may erre. Touching the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors in getting, they ſhall be ſpoken of in their place: as for the errors in maintaining their liberty, there are theſe among others, to hurt thoſe citizens they ſhould reward, and to ſuſpect thoſe they ſhould repoſe upon. And though theſe wayes in a Republique come to corruption, cauſe great evils, and that many times they haſten it to a Tyranny, as at Rome it befell <hi>Caeſar,</hi> who by ſtrong hand took away that, which unthankfulneſs denied him: yet in a Commonwealth not corrupted, are they cauſes of great good, and make it live more free, keeping men for fear of puniſhment more ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and leſs ambitious. It is true, that of all people that ever reign'd, upon the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:30490:65"/>
cauſes above alleadg'd, Rome was the leaſt ungratefull; for of her ingratitude we may ſay, there is no other example, but that of <hi>Scipio;</hi> for <hi>Coriolanus</hi> and <hi>Camillus</hi> were baniſht for the injury, the one and the other had done the people. But the one was not pardoned, becauſe he alwaies continued his malicious mind againſt the people; the other was not only recall'd, but all his lifetime after, ador'd as a Prince. But the ingratitude uſ'd towards <hi>Scipio,</hi> grew from a ſuſpicion the citizens began to have of him, which was never conceived of the others; which aroſe firſt from the greatneſs of the enemy <hi>Scipio</hi> had overcome; from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation that the conqueſt of ſo long and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous a war had given him; from the quick diſpatch of it: from thoſe favours which youth, wiſdome, and other his memorable vertues had gotten him. Which things were ſo great, that the Magiſtrates of Rome fear'd his authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, more than any thing Which diſpleas'd the grave men, as a matter not accuſtomed in Rome. And his manner of living was thought ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, that <hi>Priſcus Cato,</hi> reputed a man of great integrity, was the firſt that ſtir'd againſt him, and ſaid, that a city could not be called free, where the Magiſtrates ſtood in fear of one citizen. So if the people of Rome in this caſe followed <hi>Cato's</hi> opinion, they deſerve that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, which I ſaid before, thoſe Princes and people merit, who through ſuſpicion prove unthankfull. Wherefore concluding this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, I ſay, that whether this vice be uſed either through ſuſpicion or covetouſneſs, it ſhall appear that the people never put it in practiſe upon covetouſneſs, and upon ſuſpicion leſs than Princes, having leſs cauſe to be ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as quickly it ſhall be declared.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>What means a Prince or Republique ſhould uſe to avoid this vice of ingratitude: or what A Commander or Citizen, to be free from their danger.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>A Prince to avoyd this neceſſity of living with ſuſpicion, or being ungratefull, ought perſonally go to the warrs, as in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning did thoſe Roman Emperors, and in our daies the Turk does; and as thoſe that are valorous have done, and yet do. For o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercoming, the glory and the gain is all their own. And when they are not there in perſon, (the glory of the action belonging to another) they think, they cannot well make that conqueſt their own, unlefs they put out that glory in another which they themſelves knew not how to get, and ſo become un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull, and unjuſt. And without doubt greater is their loſs, than their gain; but when either through negligence, for lack of judgment they ſtay idle at home, and ſend out a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, I have no other precept to give them, than what they know of themſelves. But I adviſe that Commander, becauſe, as I think, he can hardly eſcape the nips of unthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that he betake himſelf to one of theſe two expedients; either preſently upon his victory let him leave his army, and put himſelf into his Princes hands, abſtaining from any action ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring of inſolence or ambition, that ſo he having no occaſion given of ſuſpicion may have reaſon to reward him, or at
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:30490:66"/>
leaſt not hurt him: Or when he likes not to do thus, let him reſolutely take part againſt him, and uſe all thoſe means whereby he may think to hold from his Prince what he hath gotten, procuring the ſoldiers and the ſubjects good wills; let him make friendſhip with his neighbors, poſſeſs with his men the ſtrong places, corrupt the Chief of his army, and aſſure himſelf of thoſe he cannot; and this way endeavor to puniſh his Lord for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude he would have us'd towards him. Otherwaies there are not; but (as it was ſaid before) men know not how to be wholly vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, nor wholly good. And alwaies it comes to paſs, that preſently after the victory, they will not part with their army; behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with modeſty they cannot, and to ſtand upon defyance in ſome honorable termes they know not how. So that being irreſolute which way to take, between delay and doubt they are ſuppreſſed. But to a Republique which would avoyd this vice of ingratitude, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not apply the ſame remedy, we may to a Prince; that is, that ſhe go herſelf, and not ſend out in her imployments, being neceſſitated to make uſe of ſome one of her citizens. It ſutes well therefore, that for her beſt remedy, ſhe take the ſame courſe the Commonwealth of Rome took, to be leſs unthankfull then all others. Which grew from her manner of government; for the whole city, both Nobles and Plebeians being train'd up to war, there aroſe alwaies in Rome in all ages men of ſuch valour, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, and reputation, that there was no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to doubt of any one of them, they being many who kept one another in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. And ſo long they continued <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:30490:66"/>
and with regard not to make others jealous of their ambition, nor give occaſion to the people to do them harme, taking them for ambitious perſons; for if any one were made Dictator, he got moſt honor by it, that laid down his Dictatorſhip ſooneſt. And ſo ſuch like way not being ſufficient to raiſe ſuſpect, could not breed ingratitude. So that a Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique that would not have cauſe given her to be unthankfull, ſhould governe her ſelf in the ſame manner Rome did. And a citizen that would be free from all their deſpights, ſhould follow the ſame ſteps the citizens of Rome went.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>That the Roman Commanders were never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily puniſh'd for any error commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; nor at all puniſh'd, when either by their ignorance, or upon ſome unlucky reſolution taken by them the Commonwealth ſuffer'd loſs.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THE Romans, as formerly we have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſ'd, were not only leſs ungrateful, than other Commonwealths, but alſo were more pitifull, and more adviſed in the puniſhment of the Generalls of their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, than any elſe. For if their fault procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from malice, yet they gently chaſtiſ'd them; but if it was through ignorance, they were ſo far from puniſhing them, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded and honour'd them. This manner of proceeding was well conſider'd by them;
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:30490:67"/>
for they judg'd it a matter of great importance to thoſe that commanded their armies, to have their mind free, without any clog upon it, and without any outwards reſpects to reſtrain them in their reſolutions; becauſe they would not add new difficulties and danger to a thing by it ſelf hard and dangerous: adviſing well that with theſe hindrances a man cannot brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly execute his deſigns. For example, when they ſent an army into Greece, againſt <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon,</hi> or into Italy againſt <hi>Anniball,</hi> or againſt thoſe people they firſt overcame; That Commander to whom the imployment was committed had the vexation of all thoſe cares that follow ſuch charges which are of weight and importance. Now if to ſuch cares, this were added, that many examples of the Romans were recorded, where they had cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifyed or otherwiſe put to death thoſe that had loſt any battels, it was impoſſible, that that Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain among ſo many ſuſpicions cou'd reſolve any thing couragiouſly. Therefore they deeming theſe ſufficiently puniſh'd with the ſhame of their loſs, they were not willing to ſtartle them with any more grievous puniſhment Here is one example, of a fault committed, and not through ignorance. <hi>Sergius</hi> and <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erginius</hi> were incamp'd againſt the Veyans, each of them commanding a part of the army: <hi>Sergius</hi> was to incounter the Tuſcans, and <hi>Verginius</hi> was to ſet upon the other ſide: It chanc'd, that <hi>Sergius</hi> being aſſaulted by the <hi>Faliſci,</hi> and other people, endur'd ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be quite rout'd and put to flight, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would ſend for ayd to <hi>Verginius.</hi> And on the other ſide, <hi>Verginius,</hi> ſtaying til til he ſhould humble himſelf, would rather ſee
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:30490:67"/>
the diſhonour of his country, and the ruine of the army, than ſuccour him. A caſe indeed very exemplary, and of much malice; neither would it have bin for the Common-wealth of Romes reputation, to have let the one or the other paſs without cenſure. True it is, that where another Republique would have puniſh'd them with death, this puniſh'd them only in a ſum of money. The cauſe hereof was, not that their offences deſerv'd not greater puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but becauſe the Romans would in this caſe, for the reaſons already alleadged, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue their ancient cuſtomes. And touching errors of ignorance, we have no better ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, than that of <hi>Maro;</hi> through whoſe raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the Romans having bin broken at Canne by <hi>Hanniball,</hi> where the Republique came indan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to loſe her liberty, yet becauſe it was igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and not malice, they not only did not chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſe him; but honor'd him, and the whole order of the Senat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>ALthough it ſucceeded happily to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, to have uſ'd liberality towards the people upon occaſion of a ſudden danger, when <hi>Porſenna</hi> made war againſt Rome, to reſtore the <hi>Tarquins,</hi> where the Senate doubting of the people, leſt they would ſooner accept of the Kings, than endure out the war; to make themſelves ſure of them, they took off from them the taxes of ſalt, and every kind of grievance, ſaying, the poor contributed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to the common good, if they did but nouriſh their children; and thereupon in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of this benefit, the people expoſ'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to indure the ſiege, the famine, and the war. Yet let none, preſuming upon this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, delay to gain the good will of the people til the times of danger; for it will never prove ſo well to them, as it did to the Romans; for the generality will think they have not this good from thee, but from thy adverſaries; and being to fear, that, when that neceſſity is paſt, thou wilt withhold from them that good which of force thou didſt them, they will not think themſelves any way beholding to thee. And the reaſon why this buſineſs ſucceeded well to the Romans, was, becauſe the State was new, and not well ſetled yet; and that people alſo had ſeen, that formerly laws had bin made for their advantage,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:30490:68"/>
as that of appeal to the people; ſo that they might well perſwade themſelves, that the good they had, was done them, not ſo muth upon occaſion of their enemies coming, as from the good diſpoſition of the Senate to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them. Moreover, the Kings were yet freſh in their memory, by whom they had bin many waies ſcorn'd, and abuſ'd.

Upon which accident we are firſt to diſcourſe, how that, when an inconvenient that riſes either in a Commonwealth or againſt a Commonwealth, cauſ'd by an inward or an outward cauſe, is become ſo great, that it begins to make every one afraid, the ſafer courſe is, to temporiſe with it, then ſtrive forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to extinguiſh it. For moſt commonly it proves, that they who indeavor to quench it
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:30490:69"/>
kindle it much more, and ſuddenly pluck down that miſchief upon their heads, which was then but fear'd from thence. And of ſuch like accidents many ariſe in the Commonwealth, oftner upon inward oceaſions then outward. Where oftentimes, either a citizen is ſuffered to lay hold of more forces then is reaſonable; or elſe ſome law begins to be corrupted, which is the very nerve and life of liberty. And this error is ſuffer'd to paſs on ſo far, that there is more danger in the remedy, then in the evil. And ſo much the harder is it to know theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenients at their birth, by how much more it ſeems to agree with mens natures, alwaies to favor things in their beginnings: and theſe favors are of more force, rather then in any thing elſe, in thoſe works that ſeem to have ſomewhat of vertue in them, and are done by young men. For if in a republique any young noble man put forward himſelf, having in him extraordinary vertue, all the citizens begin to caſt their eyes on him, and agree together without any conſideration to honor him; ſo that if he hath any touch of Ambition, meeting with thoſe favors nature affords him, and this accident coming ſuddenly in place, before the Citizens perceive the errors they are in, it falls out that they have ſmall means to help themſelves. And when theſe, that have the remedies in their powers, would put them in practiſe, they do but with haſte augment his authority. Hereof we might alleadge ſundry examples; but I will give onely one out of our own city. <hi>Coſmus</hi> of <hi>Medici,</hi> from whom the houſe of <hi>Medici</hi> in this city took the beginning of their greatneſs, came into ſuch reputation, through the favor that his
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:30490:70"/>
own wiſdom and the other citizens ignorance gave him, that he began to make the ſtate ſomewhat afraid of him, ſo that ſome citizens held it very dangerous to offend him, and others as dangerous to let him alone. But <hi>Nicholas</hi> of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>izzano</hi> living at the ſame time, who was eſteem'd a very expert man in civil affairs; and being that the firſt error was made is not knowing the dangers that might ariſe upon <hi>Coſmus</hi> his reputation, while he liv'd, would never ſuffer, that they ſhould make the ſecond, which was, that they ſhould indeavor to put him down; judging that ſuch an aſſay would be altogether the ruine of their ſtate, as in effect it came to paſs, which was after his death. For thoſe citizens that were left, not following this advice, made themſelves ſtrong againſt <hi>Coſmus,</hi> and chaſ'd him out of <hi>Florence.</hi> Whereupon it follow'd that his faction reſenting the injury, a while after recall'd him, and made him Prince of the Commonwealth; to which ſtep he could never have climb'd, without that manifeſt oppoſition. The ſelfſame befell Rome with <hi>Caeſar,</hi> whoſe vertue being favor'd by <hi>Pompey</hi> and others, at length came to change their favor into fear, whereof <hi>Cic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I ſay then, that ſeeing it is a hard thing to know theſe evils when they ariſe, this diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty being occaſion'd by a deceit, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with moſt things in their beginning do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, the wiſer way is to diſſemble them, when they are knowne, then to oppoſe them. For temporizing with, them they either
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:30490:70"/>
are extinguiſh'd of themſelves, or at leaſt the evill is put off for a longer time. And in all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires Princes ought to be well advis'd, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend either to ſuppreſſe evills, or to oppoſe their forces and their invaſions, that in liew of hurt they do them not good; and thinking to thruſt on forward a buſineſſe, they draw it not after them; or inſtead of choaking a plant, they water is not. And they ſhould well conſider, wherein the greateſt force conſiſts, and when they find their powers ſufficient to heale what is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miffe, they ſhould then apply their ſtrongeſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies; or otherwiſe, let it alone, nor in any caſe meddle with it; for it would fall out as before hath bin ſaid, and as it befel the neighbours of Rome; for whom it had bin better, after that Rome was ſo growne in ſtrength, with treaties of peace to indeavour to quiet it and ſo yet keep it backward, rather then by making a ſtrong warre againſt it, to force it to new courſes, and new defences. For to what other purpoſe ſerv'd their conſpiracy, then to make them more lively, and to thinke upon new wayes, whereby in a farre ſhorter time they much inlarg'd their power? Among which, was the creation of a Dictatour, by which, new order they not onely overcame the dangers that hung over their heads, but it was an occaſion to ſtop very many miſischiefes, which without that remedy the commonwealth muſt needs have incurr'd.</p>

                        <p>The Dictatours authority did good, and not harme, to the Commonwealth of Rome; and how authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which the citizens take upon them of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and not thoſe that are given them by the peoples free voices, are hurtfull to the civill government.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THoſe Romans are by ſome writer condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that found out in that city the way to create a Dictatour, as a thing that in time might occaſion the Roman Tyranny; alleadging, that the firſt tyrant that was in that city, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it under the title of a Dictatour, ſaying, that if this had not bin, <hi>Caeſar</hi> could never with any publque title have given any honeſt colour to his tyranny. Which matter was never well examined by him that holds this opinion, but beleev'd without ground. For it was not the name, not the degree of the Dictatour, that brought Rome into bondage, but it was the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority the Citizens tooke upon themſelves through the long continuance of their rule. And if in Rome there had bin wanting the title of a Dictatour, they would have taken another: for forces will eaſily gaine titles, but not titles forces. And we ſee it, that the Dictatour, while he was made according to the publique orders, and not by his owne authority, alwayes did good to the city. For thoſe magiſtrates that are created, and thoſe authorities that are given by extraordinary courſes wrong the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, and not thoſe that come the rodinary way As it appeares it followed in ſo long a proceſſe of time, that never any Dictatour did otherwiſe,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:30490:71"/>
then good to the Commonwealth. Whereof there are very evident proofes. Firſt becauſe to put a citizen in caſe that he can do hurt, and take extaordinary authority upon him, we muſt ſuppoſe him to have many conditions, which in a Republique not corrupted he can never have; for he muſt be very rich, and have many adherents and partiſans, which he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have, if the lawes be ſtrictly obſerv'd; and in caſe they had, ſuch kind of men are ſo doubted, that the citizens free votes ſeldome meete in them. Moreover, the Dictarous was created onely for a time, and not for ever, and onely to remedy the preſent neceſſity; for which he was created. And by his authority he had power to reſolve by him what courſes to take againſt urgent danger, and to execute any thing without calling a counſell, and to puniſh any one without appeale. Yet could he do nothing, tending to the diminution of the ſtate, as it would have bin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> to take away the Senates authority, or the peoples, to diſanull the old ordinances of the city, and to make new; ſo that, the ſhort time of his Dictatourſhip meeting with his authority, which was limited to him, and the people of Rome not corrupted, it was unpoſſible he ſhould exceed his bounds, and hurt the city: and, we finde by experience, that he evermore advantag'd it. And indeed among other Roman ordinances, this is one deſerves conſideration, and worthy to be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned among thoſe which contributed to the inlargement of that Empire: for without ſuch like courſe taken, cities could hardly eſcape out of ſuch extravagant michiefes; for the wayes ordinarily us'd in Republiques. which more ſlowly (being that no counſell, nor magiſtrate
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:30490:72"/>
hath power of himſelfe to go through with any matter, but in many things nave neede of of one another, becauſe there goes time in get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting together their conſents) their remedies are very dangerous, when they are to cure that which cannot ſtay for time: and therefore Commonwealths among their orders ſhould have ſome ſuch like way; and the Republique of <hi>Venice</hi> (which is excellent among theſe modernes) hath reſerv'd the authority to a few citizens, that in occurrences of importance, without more advice, all of them joyntly of accord may reſolve; for when in a Republique there wants ſuch an expedient, it muſt needs by keeping the old cuſtomes go to ruine, or to eſcape it, break them. And in a Commonwealth, it were to be deſir'd, that nothing ſhould chance, which might call in the uſe of extraordinary courſes. For though that extraordinary way at that time did good, yet the example prooves of ill conſequence: for the cuſtome is brought in, to breake the old orders at firſt for good, which afterwards under that colour are broken to ill intent. So that a Republique can never be perfect, unleſſe with her lawes ſhe hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for all things, and for every miſchance ordain'd the remedy, and tract out the way of her government: and therefore concluding I ſay, that thoſe Republiques which in their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers have not recourſe to a Dictatour, or ſuch like authorities, will alwayes in thoſe heavy accidents fall to ruine. And, in this new ordin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance the manner of making the choice is to be noted, how judiciouſly it was provided for by the Romans; for the creation of the Dictatour being ſome what a diſgrace to the Conſulls, the heads of the City being as well to come under
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:30490:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>
obedience, as others; and preſuppoſing, that ſome diſtaſte hereof might ariſe among the citizens, they ordein'd the power of making this choice ſhould be in the Conſuls; thinking, that when the occaſion came, that Rome ſhould ſtand in need of this Royall power, they would do it with a good will, and that they doing it themſelves, it would leſſe grieve them: For the hurts, or any evil that a man brings voluntarily upon himſelf, and of his owne choyce, are farre leſſe troubleſome, then thoſe that are done him by another: although that afterwards in the latter times, the Romans us'd in liew of a <note place="margin">Videat Conſul ne Reſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menti capiat.</note> Dictatour, to give ſuch authority to the Conſull in theſe words, <hi>Let the Conſull takecare the Commonwealth receive no dammage.</hi> And to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to our matter, I conclude, that the neighibouring inhabitants of Rome by ſeeking to ſuppreſſe them, made them not onely provide for their defence, but alſo gave them the way how they might with more force, better ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and greater authority offend them.</p>

                        <p>The reaſon, why in Rome the creation of the Decemvirate was hurtfull to the liberty of that Republique, notwitſtanding that it was made by publique and free voices.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>AND it ſeemes contrary to that which was ſaid before, that the authority which is ſeis'd on by violence, not that which is given by ſuffrages, is hurtfull to Commonweales, as the election of the ten Citizens created by the people of Rome to make lawes therin, who in time became tyrants in it, and without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect laid hold on the liberty thereof. Where we
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:30490:73"/>
ought well conſider the manner of giving the authority, and the time for which it is given: and when an abſolute authority is given for a long time (calling a yeare or ſomewhat more a long time) it will alwayes be dangerous, and will produce either good or bad effects, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the perſons to whom it ſhall be intruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhall proove good or bad: and if we looke into the authority the ten had, and that which the Dictatours had, we ſhall find that of the ten farre to outreach the other. For when the Dictatour was created, the Tribuns, the Conſuls, and the Senate remain'd ſtill in their authority, nor could the Dictatour take it from them And if he could deprive one of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulſhip, and remove another from the Senate, yet could he not diſanull the whole order of Senatours, and make new lawes: ſo that the Senate, the Conſuls, and the Tribuns continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with their authority, came to be as a guard upon him, to keepe him from ſwerving out of he right way. But in the creation of the ten there fell out the cleane contrary; for they caſhierd the Conſuls and Tribuns and gave authority of themſelves to make lawes and every thing elſe, as abſolutly as the people of Rome. So that being abſolute of themſelves without Conſuls, without Tribuns, without appeale to the people, and hereby having none to looke into their courſes, the ſecond yeare they had the meanes, eſpecially moov'd by the ambition of <hi>Appius,</hi> to become inſolent. And hereupon it is to be noted, that when it is ſaid, that a power given by free ſuffrages, never hurt any Commonwealth, we muſt preſuppoſe, that the people ſuffer not themſelves to be induc'd to give it, unleſſe with due circumſtances, and at
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:30490:73"/>
due ſeaſons. But when, either being deceiv'd, or upon ſome other occaſion leading them blindſold, they are brought to give it undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly, and in that kind as the people of Rome gave it to the ten, it will befall them alwayes, as it did to theſe. Which is eaſily proov'd, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the cauſes that held the Dictatours in goodneſſe, and thoſe that gave the ten occaſion of becomming evill. And adviſing alſo how thoſe Republiques have done, that have bin thought well governed, in the giving of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for a long time, as the <hi>Sparitans</hi> gave their Kings, and the <hi>Venetians</hi> their Duke; for a man may preceive that in one or other ſort they had their guards upon them, that they who were ill diſpos'd could not at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures abuſe that authority. Nor availes it in this caſe, that the matter is not corrupted; for an abſolute authority corrupts the matter in a very ſhort time, gathers friends, and makes partiſans, neither is poverty or want of good kindred a let; for wealth, and every other advantage preſently runnes after them, as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in the ereation of the ten we ſhall treate.</p>

                        <p>VVhat diſtaſte the <hi>Agrarian</hi> law gave in Rome, and that it is very offenſive to make a law in a Commonwealth, that lookes far backwards, and yet goes directly againſt an ancient cuſtome of the Citie.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IT is an opinion of the ancient writers, that men are wont to vex themſelves in their croſſes, and glut and cloy themſelves in their proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and that from the one and the other of theſe two paſſions proceede the ſame affects: for at what time ſoever men are freed from fighting for neceſſity, they are preſently together by the ears through ambition; which is ſo powerfull in mens hearts, that to what degree fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ver they ariſe, it never abandons them. The reaſon is, becauſe nature hath created men in ſuch a ſort, that they can deſire every thing, but not attaine to it. So that the deſire of getting being grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the power to get, thence growes the diſlike of what a man injoyes, and the ſmall ſatisfaction a man hath thereof. Hereupon ariſes the change of their ſtates, for ſome men deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to have more, and others fearing to loſe what have they already, they procede to enmities and warre, from whence comes the deſtruction of one country, and the advantage of another. This diſcourſe I have made, becauſe it ſuffis'd not the Commons of Rome, to ſecure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the Nobility by creating the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buns, to which deſire they were forc'd by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſity;
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:30490:75"/>
but that they ſuddenly, upon the obteining thereof began to contend out of ambition, and thinke to ſhare equally with the nobility both in honours and fortunes, as the things that are in moſt value with men. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon grew that diſeaſe that brought forth the quarrell touching the <hi>Agrarian</hi> law. And in concluſion, caus'd the deſtruction of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Republique. And becauſe Commonwealths well ordered are to maintain the publique wealthy, and the particulars poore, it is likely there was in Rome ſome defect in this law, which either was not ſo exactly fram'd at the beginning, but that every day it had need of ſome reviſing and amending; or that the making of it was ſo long put off, that it became ſcandalous to look ſo farre backwards; or that being well inſtituted at firſt, in time it grew by uſe corrupt. So in what manner ſoever it were, that law was never mention'd in Rome, but that the whole city was in a tumult. This law had two principall heads. By one they order'd that no citizen could poſſeſſe more then ſo many acres of ground: by the other, that the lands which they tooke from their enemies ſhould be divided among the people of Rome. It came therefore to thwart the Nobility two manner of wayes; becauſe they that had the greateſt ſtates in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſio, were not permitted by thelaw who were the greater part of the Nobility; and there upon ought not to injoy it: and when the enemies goods ſhould be divided among the common people, they tooke from the Nobility the meanes to grow rich. Theſe quarrells then being taken up againſt potent perſons, and they by their reſiſtance thinking to defend the publique, whenſoever (as it is ſaid) mention
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:30490:75"/>
was made of this law, the whole city was in an uproare; and the Nobility wrought it out with patience and with diligence, either by drawing an army forth into the field, or by oppoſing another Tribune againſt him that propounded it, or ſometimes by yeelding a part, or elſe by ſending a Colony into that place which was to be divided, as it befell them of the Country of <hi>Antium,</hi> for which upon a diſpute touching this law, there was a Colony drawne out of Rome and ſent into this place, unto whom the ſaid County was conſign'd. Where <hi>Titus Livius</hi> uſes a notable kind of ſpeech, ſaying, that with much adoe they found any one in Rome, that would give in their names to go to the ſaid Colony, the people being rather deſirous of theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages in Rome, then to go and injoy them in <hi>Antium.</hi> And the quarrell touching this law continued a good while, till the Romans tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported their armes into the uttermoſt parts of Italy, and likewiſe out of Italy. After which, as it ſeemes, it ceas'd: which ſo fell out, becauſe the fields, which the enemies of Rome poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, were farre apart from the peoples ſight, and in a place where it was not ſafe to come to cultivate them, and therefore grew they leſſe deſirous of them, and the Romans alſo did leſſe uſe to puniſh their enemies in that manner. And when they did diſpoſſeſs any towne of the territory, they there diſtributed Colonies, ſo that upon ſuch reaſons this law was laid aſleepe till the <hi>Gracchies</hi> time, by whom it being after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards awaked, quite ruin'd the Roman liberty. For they found their adverſaries ſtrength doubled; and hereupon kindled ſuch a hatred betweene the people, and the Senate, that they came to blowes and to bloud without civill
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:30490:76"/>
meane, or order. So that the publique magiſtrates having no power to give remedy hereto, nor either of the factions relying on them, they ſought private helpes, each party thinking to make a head ſhould defend them. In this quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, and diſorder, the people choſe <hi>Marius,</hi> and made him foure times Conſull; and ſo long he continued his Conſulſhip, with ſmall interva's, that he had power of his owne ſelfe to make himſelfe thrice more Conſul. Againſt which peſtilence the Nobility having no other reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, began to favour <hi>Sylla;</hi> and having made him head of their faction, they came to civill warres, and after much bloodſhed and change of chance, the Nobility remain'd conquerer Theſe quarrells were anew reviv'd in <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Pompeyes</hi> time; for <hi>Caeſar</hi> being made head of <hi>Marius</hi> his party, and <hi>Pompey</hi> of <hi>Syllaes,</hi> coming to fight, <hi>Caeſar</hi> remain'd victour; who was the firſt tyrant in Rome, (ſo that that city never after injoy'd her liberty, ſuch beginning then, and end had the <hi>Agrarian</hi> law. And although we ſhew'd other where, how the diſcords of Rome between the Senat and the People preſerv'd Romes liberty, becauſe they ſprung from thoſe lawes in favor of liberty, and therefore the end of this <hi>Agrarian</hi> law may ſeeme diſagreeing to ſuch a concluſion; yet I ſay, that upon this I no way change my opinion; for ſo great is the Nobilities ambition, that if by divers wayes and ſundry meanes it were not abated in a city, it would ſuddenly bring that city to deſtruction: ſo that if the ſtrife touching the <hi>Agrarian</hi> law had much adoe in three hundred yeares to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrall Rome; it is like enough it would have bin brought much ſooner into ſervitude, when the people both with this law, and alſo with their
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:30490:76"/>
other humours, had not alwayes bridled the Nobilities ambition. We ſee by this alſo, how much men eſteeme wealth rather then honours, becauſe the Nobility of Rome, if it toucht mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of honour, ever gave way to the people with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any extraordinary diſtaſts: but when it concern'd their wealth, ſo obſtinatly did they defend it, that the people to vent their hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our had their recourſe to thoſe extravagant wayes that are above diſcours'd of. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of which diſorder were the <hi>Gracchi,</hi> whoſe intention ought to be commended, rather then their diſcretion. For to take away a diſorder grown in a Commonwealth, and hereupon to make a law that lookes faire backwards, is a courſe ill advis'd of; and (as formely it hath been ſaid at large) it doth nothing elſe but haſten that evill to which the diſorder guides thee; but giving way to the time ſome what, either the miſchiefe comes ſlower, or of it ſelfe at length before it comes to the upſhot) goes out</p>

                     <p>THere being in Rome a very grievous peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and thereupon the <hi>Volſci</hi> and the <hi>Equi</hi> thinking a fit time preſented to bring the city of Rome into ſubjection, theſe two people having got a very great army together, ſet upon the <hi>Latini</hi> and the <hi>Hernici,</hi> and waſted their country: this the <hi>Latini</hi> and <hi>Hernici</hi> were
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:30490:77"/>
conſtrain'd to give notice of at Rome, and intreat, that the Romans would undertake their defence: to whom the Romans, excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly afflicted by the plague, anſwer'd that they ſhould take a courſe to defend themſelves with their owne forces, becauſe they were not then able to do it. Wherein appeares the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity and wiſdome of that Senate, that even in all fortunes they would reigne and give law to thoſe deliberations their vaſſalls ſhould make; nor were they aſham'd to reſolve any thing, when neceſſity preſs'd them to it, though contrary to their manner of living, and the reſolutions uſually made by them. This I ſay, becauſe at other times the ſame Senate had forbidden the ſaid people to arme and defend themſelves; and therefore to a Senat, whoſe judgment had bin weaker then was theirs, it would have ſeem'd an abatement of reputation, to have granted them ſuch a defence. But they alwayes weighed buſineſſes in their due ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, and ever choſe the leſſer ill in lieu of the greater good: for it agreed ill with them; to ſee themſelves unable to defend their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; and they were as little content, that they ſhould arme without them, for the reaſons al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged, and others alſo that are evident. Yet knowing, that in any caſe upon neceſſity they were to take armes, having the enemy upon their backes, they tooke the more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable part, and would rather, that what they were to do, they ſhould do it with their leave, to the end that having diſobeyed upon neceſſity, they ſhould not be accuſtomed to diſobey voluntarily. And though this may well appeare a courſe fit for every Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique to take, the weake and ill adviſed
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:30490:77"/>
Common wealths cannot do the like, nor know not how to ſtand upon termes of honour in the like niceties. The Duke <hi>Valentine</hi> had taken <hi>Faeuza,</hi> and made <hi>Bologna</hi> yeeld to his conditions; afterwards deſiring to returne from thence to Rome through <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> ſent a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of his into <hi>Florence</hi> to aske paſſage for himſelfe with his army. Hereupon they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted at <hi>Florence,</hi> how to manage this buſineſſe, nor did any one adviſe them to grant it him. Wherein they followed not the courſe the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans tooke: for the Duke being exceedingly well armed, and the <hi>Florentines</hi> in a manner diſarmed, that they could not hinder his paſſage, it had bin much more for their honour, if it had ſeem'd that he had paſsd with their licence, rather then by force; for there it was wholly their diſgrace, which had bin in part leſſe, if they had carried it otherwiſe. But the worſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition theſe weak Republiques have, is to take to no reſolution, ſo that what party ſoever they take, they take it perforce; and if any good be done them, it is forc'd upon them, for which they owe no thankes to their owne wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. I will give two other examples, that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd in our dayes in the ſtate of our city, In the yeare 1500, when <hi>Lewi</hi> the 12 of <hi>France</hi> had recover'd <hi>Milan,</hi> being deſirous to put <hi>Piſa</hi> into our hands, for the ſumme of 50000 ducats, which the <hi>Florentines</hi> had promis'd him, after ſuch reſtitution, he ſent his army commanded by the Lord <hi>Beaumont</hi> towards <hi>Piſa,</hi> in whom, (although he were a French man) yet the <hi>Florentines</hi> repos'd much truſt. This army and Captaine came on betweene Caſcina and Piſa, to aſſaile the walls, where ſtaying ſome daies to give order for the ſiege, there came ſome
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:30490:78"/>
Deputies of Piſa to <hi>Beavmont,</hi> who offer'd to yeeld up the city to the French army with theſe conditions, that upon the Kings word he ſhould promiſe, not to give them into the Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines hands, till after foure monthes, which termes were utterly reſus'd by the Florentines, whereupon enſued, that after a while they left the ſiege with diſgrace. Nor was that accord refus'd for other reaſon, then becauſe they doubted of the Kings word; although (ſuch was the weaknes of their counſell) that they were forc'd to put themſelves into his protection, though they truſted him not: nor in the meane while did they conſider, that the King could eaſier deliver <hi>Piſa</hi> into their hands, having gotten poſſeſſion of it, than promiſe hee would deliver that which hee had not yet in his power: wherein if hee had fayl'd, it had bin eaſy to diſcover the Kings intention, and ſo have ſpar'd their coſt. In ſuch ſort that it had bin a great deal more to their advantage, had they agreed, that <hi>Beaumont</hi> ſhould have taken it upon any promiſe; as it was ſeene afterwards by experience in the yeare 1502. when up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the rebellion of <hi>Arezzo,</hi> the Lord <hi>Jubalt</hi> was ſent by the King of France with ſuccours to the Florentines. Who being come neare to <hi>Arezzo,</hi> began to treate agreement with the towne, which upon certaine termes would have yeelded, as before the <hi>Piſans,</hi> but were againe refuſed by the <hi>Florentines.</hi> Which <hi>Jubalt</hi> perceiving, and thinking that the <hi>Florentines</hi> did little underſtand themſelves, hee began to practiſe an agreement with them by himſelf, without admitting the commiſſaries into the party, ſo that hee concluded a peace of his owne head, and thereupon entred <hi>Arezzo</hi> with his
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:30490:78"/>
owne people, ſhewing the <hi>Florentines,</hi> they were fooles, and underſtood not the affaires of the world; and if they deſir'd to have <hi>Arezzo</hi> in their hands, they ſhould let the King know of it, who could more eaſily deliver it them, having his people already in the towne, then if they were without before the walls. In <hi>Florence</hi> they forbare not to rayle upon, and blame the ſaid <hi>Jubalt,</hi> till they underſtood, that if <hi>Beaumont</hi> had bin like <hi>Jubalt,</hi> they ſhould have had <hi>Piſa</hi> as well as <hi>Arezzo.</hi> And thus to returne to our purpoſe, Republiques which will not come to reſolution, ſeldome make any party much to their advantage, unleſſe they are forc't thereupon: becauſe their weakneſſe will never ſuffer them to determine, where there is any doubt: and unleſſe that doubt bee cancell'd by a neeſſitie that violently thruſts them forward, they remaine always in ſuſpence.</p>

                     <p>THIS is eaſily knowne by any one that conſiders things preſent and things long paſt, that in all Cities and all peoples there are now the ſame deſires and the ſame humours, there were alwayes; So that it is very eaſy for him that examines with diligence the things that are paſt, to foreſee the future in any Commonwealth, and to ſerve himſelf of thoſe remedies, which were in uſe among the auncients; or not finding of thoſe which were us'd, to deviſe new, for the reſemblance theſe

But becauſe theſe conſiderations are neglected, or not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the Reader; or if underſtood, not knowne to him that governs, it followes, that continually in all ſucceſſions of ages the ſame offeeces happen. The Citie of Florence after 94 yeares having loſt a part of their dominions, as <hi>Piſa</hi> and other Townes, was forc't to make warre againſt thoſe that held them. And becauſe hee that had them in his hands, was of great power, it came it paſſe, that they were at great expence in the warrs, without good ſucceſſe. From theſe great expences they proceeded with impoſitions to grieve the people, and from thoſe grievances came the peoples murmurings and complaints. And for that this warre was order'd by a Magiſtracie of tenne Citizens, who were call'd the Councell of tenne for the warre, they were malic't by the whole body of the Citie, as the Authours of the warre, and the expences of the ſame; and they began to p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Yet ſuch was the Tribuns obſtinacie, that the Conſuls name was quite put out, and in the concluſion they were contented after ſome other order taken, rather to create Tribuns with Conſulan power, than the Conſuls; in ſuch hatred had they their name and their authority.

                     <p>HAving a purpoſe to diſcourſe particularly of the accidents that happen'd at Rome upon the creation of the Decemvirate, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks it is not much out of the way firſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late ſummarily the ſtory of that creation; and afterwards to ſift out the parts that are in thoſe notable actions; which are many and of good conſideration, as well for thoſe that endeavor to maintain a Republique free, as for them that intend to bring it under the yoke; for in this diſcourſe there will appear many errors com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the Senate, and by the people, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of the Common liberty, and many faults made by <hi>Appius</hi> Chiefe of the Decemvirate, lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mageable to that tyrannie which he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſed already founded in Rome. After ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſputes and ſtrifes paſt between the people and the Nobility, about the framing of new lawes in Rome, whereby they might firmly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh the liberty of that State, with one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord they ſent <hi>Spurius Poſthumius</hi> with two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Citizens to <hi>Athens,</hi> for the copies of thoſe lawes which <hi>Solon</hi> gave to that City, that thereupon they might found the Roman Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances. After their returne, they came to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point the men that were to examine and frame the ſaid lawes. And they ordained ten Citizens
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:30490:80"/>
for a year, of which <hi>Appius Claudius</hi> was one, a cunning and a turbulent man. And that they might without any reſpect make ſuch lawes, they took away the power of all other Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates in Rome, eſpeaially of the, Tribuns and Conſuls. They took away alſo all appeal to the people; ſo that theſe new officers became abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Princes of Rome. Afterwards <hi>Appius</hi> gain'd the authority of all his other companions, by means of the favors the people did him, for he was grown ſo popular in his behaviour, that it ſeem'd a mervail, how ſo ſuddenly he had chang'd his nature and diſpoſition, having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies before this time bin thought a cruel per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor of the common people. Theſe ten governed themſelves very moderately, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving above twelve Lictors, who always went before him that was Chieſe among them. And although they had the abſolute authority, yet when they were to puniſh any Citizen of Rome for homicide, they cited him in preſence of the people, and made them judge him. They writ their laws in ten Tables; and before they confirm'd them, publiſhed them to the general view, that every man might read and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them, whereby it might be known if there were any fault in them, which before their confirmation ſhould be amended. After this <hi>Appius</hi> caus'd a rumour to be ſpread throughout Rome that if to theſe ten Tables an addition of twoothers were made, they would be perfect So that the conceithereof gave the people occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to make the Councell of tenne againe for another yeare, whereunto the people conſented willingly, as well becauſe they would not have the Conſuls anew <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

theſe being judges of the cauſes, as is aforeſaid: It being then agreed to make a new election, the whole nobility betook themſelves to ſue for theſe honors, and <hi>Appius</hi> was amongſt the formoſt of them, and behav'd himſelf in his ſuit with ſo much courteſie towards the people, that all his competitors were jealous of it. <note place="margin">Credebant e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim haud gratuitam in tanta ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia comite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem fore.</note>

If any one being wrong'd by one of theſe Iudges did appeal to another, he was worſe abuſed in his appeal, than in his firſt tryal. So that the people having perceived their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:30490:81"/>
began to look the Nobility in the face with a great deal of ſorrow; <hi>And thence they took occaſion to ſeek after their liberty,</hi>

                        <hi>being corrupted, lov'd rather their own licentious life, than the common liberty.</hi> It fell out about this time, that the <hi>Sabini</hi> and the <hi>Volſci</hi> made war againſt the Romans. Upon which fear the ten began to ſee the weakneſs of their own eſtate: for without the Senate they could not take order for the war; and aſſembling the Senate together they thought they loſt their authority: yet upon meer neceſſity they took this laſt courſe; and having gotten the Senators together, many of them ſpake againſt the pride of the tenn, and in particular <hi>Valerius</hi> and <hi>Horatius;</hi> and their authority had bin quite aboliſhed, but that the Senate, of meer envy to the Common people, would not ſhew their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, thinking, that if the ten ſhould vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily depoſe their Magiſtracy, the making of Tribuns of the people might perhaps be
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:30490:82"/>
left. The war was then reſolved of, and two armies were led forth commanded by part of the ten: and <hi>Appius</hi> ſtaid at home to govern the City. Whereupon it happen'd, that he fell in love with <hi>Virginia;</hi> and when he would have taken her by force, her Father <hi>Virginius</hi> to free her, ſlew her; whereupon enſued di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers tumults at Rome, and in the armies, which being brought back again and joyn'd with the remainder of the people at Rome, went apart thence to the holy mount: where they ſtaid, til the ten had depoſed their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy, and that the Tribuns and Conſuls being created, Rome was reſtor'd to the ancient forme of liberty. It is noted then by the text, that the inconvenient of ſetting up a Tyranny grew firſt upon the ſame occaſions, that the greater part of Tyrannies ordinarily uſe to ariſe upon in Cities, and this is from the overmuch deſire the people have of liberty, and the exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ambition the Nobility have to command. And when they agree not to make a law in fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vor of liberty, and either party betakes it ſelf to favour ſome one, then ſuddenly ſtarts up a tyranny. The people and the Nobility of Rome conſented to create the ten; and to create them with ſo great authority, as they did for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire they both had, the one to extinguiſh the memory of the conſuls, the other of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buns. When they were created, the people thinking that <hi>Appius</hi> was become of the popular faction, and rudely handled the Nobility, the people betook themſelves to favour him.

thoſe evil that they hate, if he hath wit, it will alwaies come to paſs, that he ſhall make himſelf Lord of that City; for he will wait his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity together with the peoples favor to extinguiſh the Nobility, and will never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to oppreſs the people, till he hath quite ſuppreſt the Nobles; at which time when the people ſhall perceive themſelves to be in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, they ſhall not know whether to have recourſe for help. This courſe have they all held, that have laid the foundations of a Tyrannie in any Commonwealth. Which if <hi>Appius</hi> had likewiſe held, his tyrannie would have bin of longer durance, and not have fail'd ſo quickly; but he went the clean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary way; nor could a man have done more undiſcreetly, than he, who to maintain a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie, made thoſe his enemies that beſtowed it firſt upon him, and could ſtill make it good, and fought to gain thoſe to be his friends, who neither agreed to give it him, nor could main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it to him, and ſo loſt thoſe that were his friends, and ſtrove to make thoſe his friends, that could not be ſo: For though the nobility deſire to tyrannize, yet that part of the nobility that hath not a ſhare in the tyrannie, is alwaies enemy to the tyrant; nor is it poſſible ever to gain them all to his ſide, by reaſon of the nobilities exceeding ambition and exceſſive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varice, ſeeing that the tyrant cannot have ſo great wealth, nor ſo many honors, as to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them all. And thus <hi>Appius,</hi> forſaking the people, and cleaving to the nobility, committed a moſt evident error, and ſo for other reaſons aboveſaid; and becauſe, if a man will hold any thing by violence, he that forces muſt needs
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:30490:83"/>
be ſtronger than he that is forced. From whence it comes, that thoſe Tyrarts who have the generality to friend, and the great ones their enemies, are in the more ſafety, becauſe, their violence is ſupported with greater forces, than that which is favored by the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and hated by the people: for with the peoples favor the Forces within are ſufficient to maintain themſelves, as they were to <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis</hi> Tyrant of <hi>Sparta,</hi> when all Greece and the people of Rome aſſaulted him, having made himſelf ſure of ſome few of the Nobility, and alwaies having the people his friend, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he defended himſelf: which he could not have done, if they had bin otherwiſe. In that other degree, to have but few friends at home, the forces within ſuffice nor, but muſt be ſought after abread: and they are to be of three kinds, the one to have a guard of ſtrangers, to aſſure thy perſon; the other, to have an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in the country, which may ſerve the ſame turn the people could; the third, to hold correſpondence and friendſhip with thy put iſſant neighbours, who may defend thee. And whoſoever takes theſe courſes, and obſerves them rightly, though the people be his enemy, yet in ſome ſort may he ſave himſelf. But <hi>Appius</hi> could not by any army make himſelf maſter of the Country, the country there and Rome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one and the ſame thing; and what he could do, he knew not how to do, and ſo periſh'd in his beginning. The Senate alſo and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the creation of the Decemvira<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:30490:83"/>
people, endammage the liberty, yet the people ought, when they make their Magiſtrates, take ſuch order in their making, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain them by ſome regards from growing wicked. And where they ſhould ſet a guard over them, to keep them good, the Romans took it away, creating that the ſole Magiſtracy in Rome, nullifying all the reſt, for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive deſire (as we before ſaid) The Senate had to ſuppreſs the Tribuns, and the Common people the Conſuls: which blinded them both ſo, that they concur'd in this diſorder: for men (as King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> ſaid) do oftentimes like certain leſſer birds of prey, who ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly purſue the prey, whereunto they have a natural provocation, that they perceive not a greater bird over their heads with like eagerneſs ready to ſeize on them.

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:30490:85"/>
the Roman armies were alwaies wont under the Conſuls to be victorious, under the Decem. virate they were alwaies loſers. From this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample may we know in part the reaſons why mercenary ſoldiers are unprofitable, who have no other obligation to make them ſtand true to thee, but ſome ſmall ſtipend thou beſtoweſt on them. Which cannot be a motive ſo ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, or of ſuch weight, as to gain thee their truth and love ſo far, as to die in thy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half. For in thoſe armies, wherein there is not that affection towards him for whom they fight, which makes them become his partiſans where can never be ſo much valor, as to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due or reſiſt an enemy that hath never ſo little vertue or courage. And becauſe neither this affection, nor contention can grow in others, more then in thy natural ſubject, it is neceſſary in the maintaining of a ſtate, whether it be Commonwealth or Kingdom, to arme the native ſubjects, as we ſee all they have done, who with their armies have made any great conqueſts. The Roman armies under the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cemvirates were valorous as formerly: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſame diſpoſition was not in them, they atchiev'd not the like exploits.

                        <p>It is a matter of very evil example, when he that makes a law neglects the obſerving of it: and it is very dangerous in a ſtate, to make a continuall practiſe of cruel executions.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THe agreement being made and Rome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to her ancient forme, <hi>Verginius</hi> cited <hi>Appius</hi> before the people, to defend his own cauſe: whom appearing accompanied with many of the Nobility, <hi>Verginius</hi> commanded to be caſt into priſon. <hi>Appius</hi> began to cry out, and appeal to the people. <hi>Verginius</hi> ſaid, he was not worthy to be allow'd that appeal which himſelf had deſtroy'd, or have the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple defend him, who had ſo much endammag'd them. <hi>Appius</hi> replied, that they ought not to violate that appeal, which they with ſuch earneſt
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:30490:86"/>
deſire had ordain'd. For all this he was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon'd, and before the day of giving judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he ſlew himſelf. And though <hi>Appius</hi> his lewd life deſerv'd any puniſhment, yet ſavor'd it but little of eivil government, to violate the lawes, and eſpecially that which was but then made. For I beleeve not, there is any thing of worſe example in a Republique, then to make a law, and not obſerve it; and the more, when he that makes it breaks it. <hi>Florence</hi> after the ninty fourth year having its ſtate reeſtabliſh'd by the aid of Frier <hi>Ierom Savanarola,</hi> whoſe writings ſhew his learning, wiſdome, and vertue, and having among other ordinances to aſſure the citizens, caus'd a law to be made, that a man might appeal to the people from the ſentences, which for matter of ſtate, the Eight, or the Seignory ſhould give: which law he long perſwaded, and with much a do at length obtain'd. It happen'd that a while after the confirmation of it, five citizens were condemn'd to death by the Seignory for ſome offence touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſtate; and they deſiring to appeal, were not ſuffer'd, and ſo the law not obſerv'd. Which more wrong'd the reputation of that Frier, then any other accident. For if that appeal was profitable, he ſhould have caus'd it to be obſerv'd, if otherwiſe, he ſhould never have ſo urg'd the making of it. And ſo much more remarkable was this accident, in that the Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in thoſe many ſermons which he made, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the breach of this law, never either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned him that broke it, or excus'd the breach, as he that would not condemn any thing that ſerv'd to his purpoſe; and excuſe it he could not. Which having diſcover'd his am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious and ſactious mind, took much from his
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:30490:87"/>
credit, and charg'd him with blame enough. It is a very great fault alſo in a ſtate, every day in the citizens mindes to renew the memory of old wrongs done to this or that man with new puniſhments, as it befell at Rome after the Decemvirate. For all the ten, and other citizens at ſundry times were accus'd, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd, ſo that all the Nobility were exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly affrighted, thinking they would never leave condemning them, til they had deſtroyed the whole Nobility. And certainly it had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd ſome inconvenient in the city, if <hi>Marcus Duellius</hi> the Tribun had not taken order for it. Who made a decree, that for a whole year it ſhould not be lawfull for any man to cite or accuſe any citizen of Rome, which aſſur'd all the Nobility. Where we ſee, how great a hurt it is to a Republique or Prince, to hold their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects minds in ſuſpicion and fear with continual perſecutions and puniſhments: and without doubt a worſe courſe cannot be taken. For men that begin to doubt of miſchief, in any caſe provide for themſelves in their dangers, and grow bolder, and leſs reſpectfull how they venture on novelties. Wherefore it is neceſſary either never to hurt any, or the hurt that is to be done to do at once, and afterwards let men injoy ſome aſſurance, that may give them cauſe to quiet and ſettle their minds.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>THe people of Rome having recovered their liberty, and being return'd into their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſtate, or rather greater, inſomuch as they had made new laws, which were as new foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations laid to eſtabliſh their power, it ſeem'd probable, that Rome for ſome while would have bin at quiet; yet by experience the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was ſeen, for every day there ſprung up new tumults and new diſagreements. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Titus Livius</hi> very judiciouſly gives the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from whence they grew, methinks it is not out of purpoſe, punctually to relate his words where he ſayes, that alwaies either the people or the Nobility waxed proud, when the other grew humble; and when the Commons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taind themſelves modeſtly within their bounds, then began the youth of the Nobility to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke them with all manner of injuries; nor could the Tribuns much remedy this, for they alſo had their ſhares in the ſufferance. The No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility on the other ſide, although well they wot that their youth was too inſolent, yet being that inſolency was to be committed by one ſide, they wiſhed rather their own ſhould be the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, then the commonalty. And thus the deſire of maintaining the liberty cauſed each to proceed ſo far til they oppreſſed the other.
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:30490:88"/>
And the order of theſe accidents is, that while men endeavor to be out of fear themſelves, they begin to put others in fear; and that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury which they chaſe from themſelves, they thruſt upon another, as if there were a neceſſity either to hurt or to be hurt. Hereby is ſeen in what manner among other things Common-wealths come to diſſolution, and men riſe from one ambition to another. And as that ſentence of <hi>Saluſt</hi> put in <hi>Caeſars</hi> mouth, was very true; <hi>That all evil examples firſt</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Quod omnia ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la exempla bonis initiis orta ſunt.</note> 
                        <hi>ſpring from good beginnings.</hi> The firſt thing that thoſe citizens (as is above ſaid) endeavor, who behave themſelves ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly in a Republick, is, not onely to be out of the reach of private mens wrongs, but out of the Magiſtrates power. To attain hereto, they ſeek after friendſhips, which they gain by means, in appearance honeſt, either by ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying their want of moneys, or by protecting them from thoſe that are too mighty for them. And becauſe this ſeems worthy and noble, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one is eaſily deceived, and thereupon no body ſeeks to remedy it, till he preſevering in the ſame courſe without let, becomes ſuch a one, that the private Citizens ſtand in aw of him, and the Magiſtrates bear him reſpect. And when he is grown to this height, and no order firſt taken for reſtraint of his greatneſs, he comes to be in ſuch termes, that it proves ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dangerous to juſtle with him, for the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes I have formerly alleadged, of the danger there is to ſtrive with an inconvenient, which is already come to ſome growth in a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, becauſe then it is brought to ſuch an exigent, that there is a neceſſity to ſeek either to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh it with danger of ſudden ruine: or letting

it alone, to ſubmit to the yoke of bondage, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs death or ſome other accident prevent it. For being once come to the terms above writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that both citizens and Magiſtrates ſtand in fear to offend him, and his, without much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe after will they underſtand their own ſtrength, and hurt at their own pleaſure. Whereupon a Republique among her wayes of government ought to uſe this, to watch carefully over her citizens, that they have not power under the colour of good to do miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief: and that their reputation be ſuch as may advantage the Commonwealth, and not wrong it, as in its own place we ſhall argue it.</p>

And at that time <hi>Pacuvius Calanus</hi> being the principal Magiſtrate, and perceiving the great hazzard they went to be ſlain by them, and the city
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:30490:89"/>
yielded up to <hi>Hanniball,</hi> now that the State of Rome was in diſtreſs. Afterwards he added, that if they would let him order the buſineſs, he would provide ſo, that they ſhould be both friends; but he would ſhut them all up in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, and by giving the people power over them to chaſtiſe them, ſave them. The Senators yielded to his advice, and he call'd the people together, having the whole Senate ſhut up in the Palace, and ſaid, that the time was come wherein they might take down the Nobilities pride, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge themſelves on them for the injuryes they had received at their hands, he holding them all priſoners in his keeping: but becauſe he thought they liked not their City ſhould be without go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, it was fit (being they intended to kill the old Senators) to create new ones firſt. And therefore he had put the names of all the Senators in a bag, and ſo would begin to draw them forth one by one before them; and ſo put them to death preſently, as ſoon as they ſhould have made choice of a Succeſſor. And having begun to take out one, when he was nam'd, there was a great noiſe made, calling him a proud, cruell, and arrogant man. And <hi>Pacu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

And after a little while one of the Commons was named: whereat one began to whiſtle, another to laugh, ſome to ſpeak in one ſort, ſome in another. And ſo followed all the reſt one after another as they were nam'd, being thought unworthy to be made Senators, ſo that <hi>Pacuvius</hi> hereupon taking occaſion, ſayd' ſeeing that you judge that this City muſt needs be in ill caſe without a Senate, and you are not agreed to change your old Senators, I
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:30490:90"/>
think it would be well that ye were made friends; for this fright wherein the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors have bin put will ſo humble them, that the courteſie which ye ſought otherwhere, ye ſhall find with them. And hereunto being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, there followed the union; and it was plain, how they were deceived, when they were forc'd to come to particulars. Beſides, people in judging generally of affairs and their accidents are beguil'd, which they afterwards underſtand in particular, and perceive the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit. After the year 1494. the Principal men of the City being chac't out of Florence, and there being not any orderly government, but rather an ambitious licentiouſneſs, ſo that things went from bad to worſe, many of the popular faction perceiving the deſtruction of the City, and underſtanding no other cauſe thereof, they blam'd the ambition of ſome powerfull man, that nouriſh'd theſe diſorders, to the end he might make of it a State to his own purpoſe, and take away the liberty; and theſe men were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in the publique places of meeting, ſpeaking evil of many Citizens, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them, that if ever they came to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the State, they would diſcover this their treachery and chaſtiſe it. It happen'd of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes, that ſome of theſe or the like were prefer'd to the Principal Magiſtracy, and when they were once in the place, and ſaw things nearer, they knew well the diſorders from whence they grew, and the dangers that hung over them, and the difficulty to remedy them. And having ſeen how the times and not the men caus'd the diſorder, became forthwith of another mind, and chang'd their opinion. For the knowledg of things in particular took
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:30490:90"/>
away that deceit, which when they conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red generally, was preſuppoſed in them: ſo that they that had firſt, when they were pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men, heard them ſpeak, and ſaw them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards being prefer'd to the chief Magiſtracy ſtand quiet, thought it came not from an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter knowledge of things, but becauſe they had bin carried away, and corrupted by the great ones. And this befalling many men many times, it came to a Proverb, that ſaid, theſe are of one mind in the piazza, and of another in the palace. Conſidering therefore this whole diſcourſe, we ſee, how a man may quickly open the peoples eyes, for ſeeing that a generality deceives them, it is expedient to bring them to deſcend to particulars, as <hi>Pacuvius</hi> did in Capua, and the Senate in Rome. I think alſo, this may paſs for a concluſion, that no wiſe man ought to avoyd the peoples judgment in particular things, about the diſtributions of degrees and dignities: for onely in this the people are not deceived; or if ſometime they are deceived, it is very ſeldom; but a few men are oftentimes deceived, when they are to make the like diſtribution: Nor do I take it to be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous, to ſhew, in the next Chapter, the order the Senate held to clear the peoples judgments in theſe diſtributions.</p>

Indeed in the beginning of that Magiſtracy they committed one error creating it for five years: but not long after wards it was amended by the wiſdome of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercus</hi> the Dictator, who, by a new law he made, reduc'd the ſaid magiſtracy to the terms of eighteen moneths. Which the Cenſour, that were then in office took ſo much a miſs that they put <hi>Mamercus</hi> out of the Senate' which thing was much blam'd both by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and the fathers. And becauſe the ſtory ſhews not any where, that <hi>Mamercus</hi> could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend himſelf, it muſt needs be, that either the hiſtorian was defective, or the laws of Rome in this part not perfect: for it is not well, that in a Commonwealth it ſhould ſo be ordein'd, that a citizen for publiſhing a law agreeable to the liberty they liv'd in, ſhould be wrong'd without any remedy, But returning to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this diſcourſe; I ſay, that a man ought to conſider by the creation of this new magiſtrate, that if thoſe cities that have had their beginnings free, and were under their
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:30490:92"/>
own government, as Rome, with much adoe can find out good laws to maintain them free, it is no marvel, that thoſe cities which have had their beginnings immediatly ſervile, have not found not onely difficulty, but impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ever ſo to order themſelves, that they can quietly come to a civil government, as appears it befell the city of Florence, becauſe her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning was in Subjection to the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and having gotten leiſure to breathe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to make her own laws, which having bin mingled with the ancient, that were naught, could not work any good effect, and thus ſhe proceeded in a government for 200 years (as we have by certain relations) without ever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to ſuch a condition, that ſhe could truly be term'd a Republique: and theſe difficulties which ſhe hath had, have thoſe Cities alwaies had whoſe beginnings have bin like hers And though many times by publique and free voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ample authority hath bin given to ſome few Citizens to reforme this, yet never have they order'd it to the advantage of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, but to ſerve the turn of their own facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which hath caus'd more diſorder, then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the City. And to come to ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular example, I ſay, among other things which he that ordains a Republique ſhould conſider, is, that he well adviſe to what men he gives the power of life and death over his Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens. This was well provided for in Rome; for by ordinary courſe they might appeal to the people: yet if there were any occaſion of importance, where, to delay execution, by means of the appeal, was dangerous, they had the help of a Dictator, who had power immediatly to execute; which remedy they
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:30490:92"/>
never us'd, but upon neceſſity. But Florence and other Cities beginning as ſhe did, that is ſervile, had this authority committed alwaies to a ſtranger, who was ſent by the Prince, to this purpoſe. When afterwards they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came free, they continued this authority in a ſtranger, whom they called their Captain. Which thing, becauſe he might eaſily be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by the potent Citizens, was very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious. But afterwards this order chagning upon the alteration of the ſtates, they ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned eight Citizens, to ſupply the Captains place. Which order of evil became very evil, for the reaſons we have otherwhere alleadged, that a few are alwaies ſervants of a few, and eſpecially of the moſt wealthy: from which the City of <hi>Veuice</hi> is well guarded, which hath ten citizens, who have power to puniſh any Citizen without appeal: and becauſe they would not be of ſufficient force to puniſh thoſe that are potent, though they have the authority they have ordained the Quarantie, or council of forty: and beſides, they have taken care, that the council of the Pregai, which is the chiefer council, may puniſh them: ſo that, where there is no want of an accuſer, they are never deſtitute of a Judge, to reſtrain the great mens inſolency. There is then no marvail (ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that in Rome order'd by it ſelf, and by ſo many ſage perſons, there grew every day new occaſions, whereupon new lawes were to be made in favor of the Common liberty) if in other Cities which have had their beginnings more diſordered, there ariſe ſuch difficulties that put them quite paſt all recovery.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>TItus Quincius Cincinnatus;</hi> and <hi>Cneus Iulius Mentus</hi> were Conſuls together in Rome, who upon a quarrel ariſen between them two, made a ſtay in all the actions belonging to the Republique: which the Senate ſeeing, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded them to create a Dictator, to the end that might be done, which, by reaſon of their diſcord, was hindred. But the Conſuls diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing in every thing elſe, in this alone were of accord both of them, not to make a Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor: ſo that the Senate finding no other help, deſir'd aſſiſtance from the Tribuns, who with the Senates authority forc'd the Conſuls to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey. Where the profitable uſe of the Tribunate is in the firſt place remarkable, which ſerv'd to good purpoſe to bridle the great mens am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions exercis'd not onely againſt the Common people, but alſo among themſelves: in the next place, that it ſhould never be ſo ordain'd in a city, that a few ſhould reſolve of thoſe things that are the ordinary maintenance of a Common-wealth. For example, if thou giveſt the power to one Conſul to make a diſtribution of honors and profits, or to a Magiſtrate to diſpatch ſome buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be done, it is fit to impoſe a neceſſity on him, that he do it in any caſe, or ſo provide that another might and ſhould do it: otherwiſe the order would be defective, and perilous, as we ſee it was in Rome, unleſs they could have oppos'd the Conſuls obſtinacy with the Tribuns authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. In the Commonwealth of <hi>Venice</hi> the great council beſtows both the honors and the profits.

It ſometime chanc't, that the univerſality upon ſome diſdaine conceiv'd, or by reaſon of ſome falſe ſuggeſtion did not make choice of any ſucceſſours to the Magiſtrates of their Cities, nor to their Miniſters of State abroad, which was a very great diſorder; for all at once, their Townes and Cities wanted their lawfull Iudges; nor could any thing be obtained while the univerſality were appeaſed, or were no longer deceived. And this inconvenient would have brought thoſe Cities to ill termes, had not ſome diſcreet Citizens otherwiſe taken order for them. Who having layd hold of a fit occaſion, made a law, that all the Magiſtrates within or without the Citie ſhould continue ſtill in their offices, till new choice were made, and their ſucceſſours appointed. And thus they tooke away from that counſell all opportunity of enabling them, with the Commonwealths danger, to ſtop the publique actions.</p>

                     <p>WIſe men gaine themſelves alwayes the thanks of every thing in their actions, although in truth meere neceſſitie conſtraines them in any caſe to doe them. This diſcretion was well made uſe of by the Romane Senate, when they reſolv'd to ad a dayly ſtipend out of the Common treaſury to thoſe that ſerved in the warres; it being then of cuſtome there to ſerve as their own proper charges. But the Senate
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:30490:94"/>
ceiving, that after that manner they could not long make warre; and hereupon neither could they beſiege townes, nor lead their armies farre off; and judging it needfull they ſhould doe the one and the other, they determined to allow the ſayd ſtipends, which they did in ſuch a way, that they got themſelves thanks for that, to which they were bound by neceſſitie. And this preſent was ſo acceptable to the people, that all Rome ſeem'd overjoyd with it, they thinking it to be a great benefit, which they never had hopes of, nor of themſelves had ever ſought after. And though the Tribuns did their beſt to blot out theſe thanks, by ſhewing it was a matter of grievance and not of caſe to the people, ſeeing of neceſſitie they were to impoſe greater taxes on them, wherewith to pay theſe ſtipends, yet could they not prevayle ſo much, but that the people tooke it very thankfully. Which alſo the Senate augmented by the courſe they tooke in ordering of the tributes. For the greateſt and heavieſt were thoſe they layd upon the Nobilitie, and ſo were thoſe that were firſt payd.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>WEe ſee by the above written diſcourſe, how great credit the Nobility got with the people, upon the demonſtrations make for
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:30490:94"/>
their advantage, as well by the ſtipend appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as alſo by the courſe they tooke in impoſing the taxes: in which way if the Nobilitie had continued, they had wholly avoyded all manner of tumult in that Citie, and they had taken from the Tribuns the credit they had with the people, and by conſequence their authority. And truly it is not poſſible in a Commonwealth, eſpecially in thoſe that are corrupted, by any better way, leſſe hurtfull, and more eaſy to oppoſe the ambition of any Citizen, than to prepoſſeſſe thoſe wayes, by which a man perceives he takes his courſe, to attaine that dignitie hee aymes at. Which meanes if they had put in practiſe againſt <hi>Coſmus</hi> of <hi>Medici,</hi> his adverſaries had gotten more by the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, than by chaſing him from Florence: For if thoſe Citizens that were at brabble with him had taken the courſe to favour the people, they had without any imbroyle or violence taken out of his hands thoſe weapons which were to him of greateſt advantage. <hi>Peter Soderini</hi> gain'd himſelf credit with this onely in the Citie of Florence, that he favou'd the univerſality. Which univerſality gave him the repute, to be a lover of the Cities libertie. And ſurely for thoſe Citizens that envyed his greatneſſe, it was much eaſier, and had bin a buſineſſe of fairer carriage, of leſſe danger and dammage to the Commonwealth, to lay hold before hand of thoſe wayes by which he became great, than by offering to oppoſe him, leſt that in ruining him, the whole remainder of the Common-wealth alſo ſhould have fallen to ruine. For if they could have taken out of his hands the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces whereby hee became ſtrong, which they might eaſily have done, they could in all their
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:30490:95"/>
publique counſells and reſolutions have oppos'd him without ſuſpicion or regard. And if any man ſhould reply, that if the Citizens that hated <hi>Peter</hi> committed an orrour in not prepoſſeſſing the wayes wherby he gain'd upon the people: <hi>Peter</hi> alſo came to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit an errour in not laying hold beforehand of thoſe wayes by which his adverſaries fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him: I anſwer, that <hi>Peter</hi> deſerves excuſe, as well becauſe it was hard for him to doe it, as becauſe the meanes were not fit for him to uſe. For the wayes by which he was hurt, were to favour the houſe of <hi>Medici,</hi> by which favours they overmaſter'd him, and at laſt ruin'd him. Yet <hi>Peter</hi> could not fairely take his part, becauſe hee could not with any good repute deſtroy that libertie, over which hee was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as guardian; and ſeeing theſe favors could not paſſe in private, they were ſuddenly exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dangerous to <hi>Peter:</hi> for what way ſoever it had bin that he had bin diſcover'd to be a friend of the <hi>Medici,</hi> he had fallen into the jealouſie, and incurr'd the hatred of the people. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon his enemyes had had greater power to ſuppreſſe him, then formerly they had. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men ought in every reſolution, conſider the defects and dangers thereunto belonging, and not faſten on any one of them, when they carry with them more danger then profit, notwithſtanding that they ſeeme well to tend to the end propounded: for being otherwiſe, in this caſe it would befall them, as it befell <hi>Tullius,</hi> who by going about to diminiſh <hi>Marc Antonius</hi> his power, increas'd it. For <hi>Marc Antonius</hi> being judged an enemy of the Senate, and he having got together a great army, good part whereof had followed <hi>Caeſars</hi> faction,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:30490:95"/>
                        <hi>Tullius</hi> to take theſe ſouldiers from him, perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Senate to ſet up the reputation of <hi>Octavianus,</hi> and ſeng him accompanied with the Conſuls, and an armie againſt <hi>Marc Antonius;</hi> alleadging, that ſo ſoone as ere the ſouldiers that followed <hi>Marc Antonius</hi> ſhould heare the name of <hi>Octavianus, Caeſars</hi> nephew, and that would be call'd <hi>Caeſar</hi> too, they would forſake the other, and follow this.

Wherefore
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:30490:96"/>
when we conſider here, that which is eaſy, and that which is hard to perſwade a people to, this diſtinction is to be made. Either, that which thou art to perſwade them to, repreſents at the firſt view gaine or loſſe; or is a courſe that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes ſomwhat in it of courage or cowardiſe, And when in things that are propounded to the people, there appears advantage, though cover ly therebe diſadvantage in it; and when it ſeemes couragious, though underneath there be covertly hid the deſtruction of the Republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que, it will alwayes be very eaſy to draw the multitude thereto. And ſo likewiſe it will bee alwayes very difficult to perſwade them to thoſe courſes, where there appears either cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardiſe or loſſe, though when it is better weigh'd and advis'd upon, therin is contein'd both ſafety and advantage. And what I have ſaid is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed with very many examples of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, as alſo with thoſe from abroad, both moderne and ancient. For from hence grew the evill opinion which was rais'd in Rome of <hi>Fab Max.</hi> who could not perſwade the people of Rome, that it was profitable for that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth to proceed ſlowly in that war, &amp; to ſuſteine and beare up againſt <hi>Hanniballs</hi> violence without fighting: for the people deem'd it a baſe courſe, nor had they judgement to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the advantage there was to be gotten by it: nor had <hi>Fab.</hi> reaſons ſufficient to make it plaine by demonſtrations: &amp; ordinarily the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are ſo much blinded in theſe opinions of courage, that though they of Rome had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted that error to give power to him that was Commander of the horſe under <hi>Fab.</hi> to fight with <hi>Hannib.</hi> whether <hi>F.</hi> would or no, &amp; that by reaſon thereof the Roman army had like to

I will alleadge one other Ro. example. <hi>Hanniball</hi> had bin in Italy 8. or 10. yeares, &amp; had fill'd the whole country full of bloudy ſlaughters of the Romans, when there came into the Senate one <hi>M. Centenius Penula,</hi> a very baſe fellow, yet he had had ſome place of charge in the armie; And offer'd, that if they would give him authoritie to leavy an armie of voluntaries, in what place ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it were in Italie, hee would in a ſhort time deliver into their hands <hi>Hanniball,</hi> either priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner or dead. The Senate thought his demand very raſh, yet they conſidering that if it were denied him, and afterwards his motion were made knowne to the people, that ſome trouble might ariſe thereupon, and ſo the evill will and envy thereof light upon the Senate, they yielded to him, being content rather to ſuffer the hazzard of all thoſe that went out with him, then to give any occaſion of raiſing new diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents among the people, conſidering how likely this courſe was to be acceptable, and how hard to be diſſwaded. He went then with this inordinate and rude multitude to ſeek out <hi>Hanniball,</hi> with whom he no ſooner met, but he and all his troops were either ſlaine or routed. In <hi>Greece</hi> in the city of <hi>Athens, Nicias</hi> a very grave and diſcreet man, could never perſwade the people that it was not for their good to go and undertake an expedition againſt <hi>Sicily,</hi> ſo
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:30490:97"/>
that they having reſolved thereupon, contrary to the wiſe mens likeings, there enſued the whole ruine of <hi>Athens. Scipio</hi> when he was made Conſull, and that he deſir'd the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of Affricke, promiſing the utter ruine of <hi>Carthage,</hi> whereunto the Senate not agreeing by the advice of <hi>Fabius Maximus,</hi> threatened to propound it to the people, as he that well knew how ſuch like reſolutions pleas'd them. We could alſo to this purpoſe lay downe ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of our owne city, as was that of <hi>Hercules Betivogli,</hi> commander for the Florentines, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with <hi>Antoni Giacomini;</hi> after they had routed <hi>Bartolomeus Alvianus</hi> at Saint <hi>Vincenti,</hi> they went to incampe before <hi>Piſa,</hi> which enterpriſe was reſolv'd on by the people upon the brave promiſes <hi>Hercules</hi> made them; though many diſcreet citizens did no way like of it, yet they could not hinder it, thruſt on by the generall deſire, which was grounded on the commanders large promiſes. I ſay therefore, that there is not an eaſier way to inlarge a Commonwealth, where the people hath the authority, then to put them into brave undertakings. For where the people is of any worth or valour, thoſe will be alwayes well lik'd of, and if any man be of different opinion, he ſhall not be of force to perſwade it. But if hereupon comes the deſtruction of the city, thence proceeds alſo, and moſt ordinarily the particular ruine of thoſe citizens who are made the commanders of ſuch like under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings; for the people having preſuppoſed the victory, when they go by the loſſe, never impute it to their General's evill fortune or want of ſufficient forces, but blame him rather of treaſon or ignorance, and ſo either
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:30490:98"/>
put him to death, impriſon or confine him, as it befell very many Carthaginian Captains, and Athenians. Nor ſhall any of the former victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries gloriouſly gotten, afterwards ſhelter them, for the preſent miſhap cancels the records of all good paſt: as it befell <hi>Antoni Giacomini</hi> our countrey man here, who not having overcome the <hi>Piſans,</hi> as the people preſuppoſed, and he had promiſed, fell into ſuch diſgrace with the people, that for all his many good ſervices paſt, he lived rather by the courteſy of thoſe that having power with the people, protected him, then by any aſſurance elſe was given him.</p>

or that abides in a city where a tumult ariſes, ought repreſent himſelf upon the occaſion, with the greateſt grace, and in as honorable termes as may be, cladding himſelf with the ornaments belonging to his degree and quality, to gain him the more reverence. A few years agoe, Florence was divided into two factions, of the <hi>Frateſchi</hi> and <hi>Arrabiati,</hi> for ſo they were called: and comming to blowes, the <hi>Frateſchi</hi> were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, among whom was <hi>Paul Antonius Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rini,</hi> a citizen of great eſteem in thoſe dayes: and the people in the time of thoſe tumults go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in armes to ſack his houſe, <hi>Franciſcus</hi> his brother then Biſhop of <hi>

I conclude then that there is not a more ſetled nor more neceſſary remedy to ſtop the fury of a multitude, then the preſence of ſuch a man, who in his aſpect and worth brings an awful reverence with him. And thereupon we ſee (to return to the text formerly allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged) with what obſtinacy the Commons of Rome accepted the party, to go to <hi>Veium,</hi> thinking it advantagious to them, but never conſidering the miſchief therein involved; and how being there aroſe divers tumults upon the occaſion, there would have bin harme done, had not the Senate accompanied with many grave and reverent perſonages reſtrained their fury.</p>

                        <p>How eaſily things are ordered in a city where the people is not corrupted: and that where a parity is there is no place for a Principallity; and where that is not, a Republique cannot be.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>ALthough that heretofore we have ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently treated, what is to be feared and what to be hoped for of Cities that are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted: yet methinks it is not out of purpoſe to conſider a reſolution the Senate took, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the vow <hi>Camillus</hi> made, to give the tenth part of the prey they took from the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>eientes,</hi> to <hi>Apollo.</hi> Which prey being fallen into the peoples hands, ſeeing they could no otherwiſe ever ſee any account of it, the Senate made an edict, that every one ſhould publiquely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the tenth part of what he had gotten in the ſpoil of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>eium.</hi> And though this reſolution took not place, the Senate having afterwards found out another expedient, and by other means given ſatiſfaction to <hi>Apollo</hi> for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, yet we perceive by theſe determinations, how much the Senate truſted in the peoples goodneſs and how they judg'd, that there was not one of them but wou'd punctually bring forth what he was commanded by the edict. And on the other ſide, how the people thought not in any part to deceive the edict, by giving leſs then was due, but rather to free themſelves therefrom, by ſhewing their open diſtaſte at
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:30490:99"/>
ſuch courſe taken. This example with many others, above alleadged, give very good evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the great goodneſs and religion was in that people, and what might be hop'd for of them. And truly where this goodneſs is not, little can be hop'd for: as we can hope for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in thoſe countreys, which in theſe daies we ſee corrupted, as in Italy above others, ſo France and Spain retain a part of the ſame cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption: and if in thoſe countreys we ſee not ſo great diſorders as every day ariſe in Italy, it proceeds not ſo much from the peoples goodneſs (which is very much fail'd) as from that they are under one King who keeps them together in union, not onely by his vertue, but by the ordinary courſe of government in thoſe Kingdomes, which is not yet quite perverted. This goodneſs is yet ſeen in <hi>Germany,</hi> and this kind of conſcience is alſo of great force with thoſe people, which is the occaſion that many Republiques continue free, and do ſo ſtrictly obſerve their own laws, that no forrain enemy abroad, nor ambitious man at home, dares offer to ſeize on them. And to proove this true, that in thoſe countreys there remain ſtill the marks of that ancient goodneſs, I will give ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther example, like to that aboveſaid of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and of the people of Rome. Thoſe Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques uſe, when they chance to have need of any money they lay out for the common good, that the Magiſtrates, or the Conſuls, having, authority, ſhould taxe the inhabitants of the city one or two in the hundred, of that which every man is worth. And ſuch a reſolution be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made according to the order of the town, every man comes beſore thereceivers of that tax, and having firſt taken an oath to pay a
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:30490:100"/>
convenient ſum, he throws into a cheſt, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to that purpoſe, what in his conſcience he thinks he ſhould pay. Of which payment there is no other witneſs, but he that payes. Whereby we may well gueſs at the great good and religion there is yet left among thoſe men. And we may well think, that every one payes the due ſum; for if it were not paid, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition would not yeeld that quantity, as thoſe of old time were wont to do: which fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, the deceipt would appear: whereupon they would ſeek ſome other means to leavy their moneys, then this. Which goodneſs is ſo much the more to be admir'd in theſe times, becauſe it is very rare, or rather remains onely in this countrey. Which proceeds from two things, the one, becauſe they have not had much commerce with their neighbors; for neither have theſe gone into their countreys, nor they come to viſit theſe, becauſe they have bin contented with thoſe goods, to feed on thoſe victuals, and to be clad with thoſe wools, which the countrey affords; whereby is taken away the occaſion of all converſation, and the beginning of all corruption. For ſo they could not learn the French, Spaniſh, or Italian man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, which nations together corrupt the whole world. The other reaſon is, becauſe thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publiques where the common liberty is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, and uncorrupted, do not permit that any citizen of theirs ſhould live after the manner of a gentleman, but rather maintain among them an equality; and thoſe that live in that countrey are cruel enemies to the Lords and Gentlemen. And if by chance they fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their hands, they put them to death, as the principal authors of corruption, and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:30490:100"/>
of ſcandal. And to make plain this name of gentlemen what it is, I ſay, that thoſe are call'd gentlemen, that live in idleneſs, yet deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly, of the profits of their eſtates, without having any care to cultivate their lands, or to take any other pains neceſſary to the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of mans life. Theſe kind of men are very hurtfull in every Commonwealth, and countrey; but worſe are they, that, beſides the foreſaid fortunes, hold ſtrong Caſtles, and have vaſſals that obey them. With theſe two ſorts of men the Kingdom of Naples abounds. the countrey about Rome, Romagna, and Lombardia. This is the cauſe, that in thoſe countreys there hath never bin any Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique nor any civil government: for ſuch kinds of men are enemies to all civil government. And if a man had a minde to bring into ſuch countreys the forme of a Commonwealth, he would find it impoſſible; but to bring them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſome order, if any man had the power, he could take no other courſe, then reduce them to a Royalty. The reaſon is this, becauſe where the matter is ſo extreamly corrupted, that the laws are not able to reſtrain it, it is needfull to ordain together with them a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er power, which is the authority of a King, who by his abſolute and extraordinary power may be of force to bridle the exceſſive ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and corruption of the mighty. This rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is verified in the example of <hi>Tuſcany:</hi> where we ſee that in a ſmall ſpace of countrey three Republiques have long conſiſted, <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, Siena,</hi> and <hi>Lucca;</hi> and that the other cities of that countrey ſerve in ſuch a kind, that they have their diſpoſitions and their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders much like them, and that they would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:30490:101"/>
maintain the common liberty, all this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes from hence, becauſe there are no lords of Caſtles in thoſe countreys, and never a one, or very few Gentlemen; but ſuch equality, that an underſtanding man that hath appli'd himſelf to the knowledg of the ancient civil governments, might eaſily reduce them to a free ſtate. But their misfortune hath bin ſo great, that as yet they have not lit upon any man that had either the power or knowledg to put it in execution. This concluſion then I draw from hence, that he that ſtrives to frame a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique where there are many gentlemen, cannot do it, unleſs he firſt dſpatch them all out of the way: and he that would erect a Monarchy or a Principallity where there is much equality, ſhall never effect it, unleſs he drawes out of that equality many of ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and turbulent mindes, and makes them rather gentlemen in effect, then in title, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching them with Caſtles, and poſſeſſions, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing them the favor of wealth and men, to the end that he being plac'd in the midſt of them, by their means may maintain his power, and they by his favor preſerve their ambition, and the reſt be conſtrain'd to bear that yoke which force and nothing elſe can make them endure. And there being by this way a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion from him that forces, to him that is forced, thereby men continue ſetled every one in their order. And becauſe to bring a countrey to be a Republique which is fit to be a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and of one fit to be a Republique to make a Kingdome, is a ſubject worthy of a man of extraordinary judgment and authority; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny there have bin that have endeavor'd it, but few have bin able to go through with it: becauſe
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:30490:101"/>
the weight and conſequence thereof partly frights them, and partly ſo overbears them, that they fail in their firſt beginnings. I think the experience we have of the Republique of Venice will ſeem a little to contrary my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that where there are gentlemen, a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique cannot be inſtituted: for there none can partake of the dignities, unleſs they be gentlemen. The anſwer hereto is, that this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample makes no oppoſition againſt us; for the gentlemen in that Republique are rather in name, then in effect: for they have not great revenues out of poſſeſſions, and lands, but their great wealth is founded upon merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, and moveable goods; and moreover none of them hold any Caſtles, or have any juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction over men: but the name of gentleman among them is a name of honor and credit, not being grounded upon any of thoſe things that caus'd thoſe in other cities to be call'd gentlemen. And as other Republiques have all their diviſions under ſeveral names, ſo Venice is divided into the Gentility, and the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty; and their order is, that thoſe are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of all honors, theſe not. Which is not any cauſe of imbroile among them, for the reaſons we have other where ſaid. Let a Common-wealth then be there ordain'd, where allthings are reduc'd to an equality; and contrariwiſe, let a Prince be made, where great inequality is; otherwiſe ſhall there be neither proportion nor continuance.</p>

                     <p>FRom whence this proceeds I know not, but it is evident as well by ancient as modern examples, that no very heavy accident ever befell any countrey or City, that hath not bin foretold either by ſome Diviners, or by ſome revelations, or prodigies, or ſignes from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. And not to goe too far from home to fetch the proof hereof, every one knows how long be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore the coming of <hi>Charles</hi> the eighth of France into Italy was foretold by Fryer <hi>Jerome Savanarola:</hi> and how beſides this, it was ſaid throughout all Tuſcany, that there were heard in the aire, and ſeen over <hi>Arrezzo,</hi> many men in armes skirmiſhing together.

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:30490:102"/>
he paſt by the new way, a voyce greater than any mans, which warn'd him to tel the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates that the Frenchmen were coming to Rome. The reaſon hereof I think fit to be diſcours'd upon, and treated of by ſome man well verſed in the knowledge of natural and ſupernatural things, which I profeſs not. Yet it may be, as ſome Philoſophers will have it, that the ayre being full of ſpirits, who by their natural knowledge foreſeeing things to come take compaſſion upon men, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſe them by ſuch like ſignes, to the end they ſhould prepare themſelves for their defence. But however it is, we may find it true, that alwaies after ſuch ſtrange accidents, new and extraordinary chances befall countreys.</p>

                     <p>MAny Romans (the countrey all about be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much ruined and waſted upon the Frenchmens paſſage to Rome) were gone to dwell at <hi>Veyum,</hi> contrary to the appointment and order of the Senate; who, to remedy this diſorder, commanded by their publique edicts, that every one within a ſet time, under a certain penalty, ſhould return to inhabite at Rome. At which edicts at firſt, they againſt whom they were directed, ſcoffed; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, when the time drew near that they were to obey, they all yielded their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. And <hi>Titus Livius</hi> uſes <note place="margin">Ex ferocibus univerſis ſingt, metu ſuo obedientes fuere.</note> theſe words: <hi>Of fierce that
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:30490:103"/>
they were all in general, each one out of his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular fear became obedient.</hi> And truly the nature of a multitude in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular cannot better be laid open, than here in this Text it is ſhewed: for the multitude is many times very inſolent in their ſpeeches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Princes decrees. Afterwards when they ſee their puniſhment near and certain, not truſting to one another, they haſten all to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; ſo that it plainly appears, that a man ought to have regard to the good or ill diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the people towards him; if it be good, to take ſuch order that it may ſtill continue; if ill, to provide ſo that it cannot hurt him. This is meant for thoſe ill diſpoſitions which the people have bred in them upon any other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, than for the loſs of their liberty, or for the love of their Prince, who is yet living. For the evil humors that ariſe from theſe cauſes are terrible beyond meaſure, and have need of great remedies to reſtrain them. Their other indiſpoſitions will be eaſy, when they have not made choyce of any heads, to whom they may have their recourſe: for on oneſide, there is not a more dreadfull thing, than a diſſolute multitude, and without a head: and on the other ſide, there is nothing weaker then it; for though they have their weapons in their hands, yet will it be eaſy to reduce them, provided that thou canſt avoyd the firſt ſhock of their furie: for when their rage is a little appeas'd and every one conſiders that he is to return again to his home, they begin then a little to doubt of themſelves, and to take a care for their ſafety, either by flight or agreement. Therefore a multitude up in armes, deſiring to eſcape theſe dangers, is to make ehoyce of
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:30490:103"/>
a head out of themſelves who may direct them, keep them united, and provide for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, as did the common people of Rome, when after the death of <hi>Verginia,</hi> they depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from Rome, and for their own preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they choſe 20 Tribuns from among themſelves: which if they do not, there all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies befalls them that which <hi>Titus Livius</hi> ſaies in his above written diſcourſe, that joyntly together they are of ſtrength and vigor; but when each one afterwards begins to adviſe of his own danger, they become weak and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible.</p>

                        <hi>nature of the multitude, that they are either ſlaviſh in their obedience, or inſolent in their auihority.</hi> I know not, whether herein I undertake not too hard a task, ſo full of difficulties, that I muſt either give it over with ſhame, or continue it with blame, having a deſire to defend that, which, as I have ſaid, is accuſed by all writers. But however it be, I do not judge it, nor ever will, a defect to defend ſome opinions with their reaſons, without any intention to uſe either authority or force. Therefore I ſay, that of that defect whereof thoſe writers accuſe the multitude, all men in particular are guilty, and eſpecially Princes: for every one that is not regulated by the lawes would commit the ſame errors which the looſe multitude does. And this we may eaſily know, for there are and have bin many evil Princes; and vertuous and diſcreet ones but a few. I ſpeak of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that have bin able to break the bridle that could check them; among whom we reckon not thoſe that were in Egypt, when in that very ancienteſt antiquity that countrey was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by the lawes; nor thoſe of <hi>Spavta,</hi> nor thoſe that in our daies are in France, which Kingdom is order'd more by the laws, than any other which in theſe times we have knowlege of. And theſe Kings which grow up under ſuch conſtitutions are not to be accounted in that number, from whence we are to conſider the nature of every man by himſelf, and diſcerne if he be like the multitude: for in parallell with them, we ſhould ſet down a multitude in like manner regulated by the lawes, as they are, and therein ſhall be found the ſame goodneſs
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:30490:104"/>
that is in them: and we ſhall ſee they neither inſolently domineere, nor ſlaviſhly ſerve, as the people of Rome, which whileſt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique continued uncorrupted, never ſerv'd baſely, nor rul'd proudly, but with their own cuſtomes, and Magiſtrates held their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree honorably. And when it was neceſſary to riſe up againſt one that were powerfull, they did it, as it appear'd in the example of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> and in that of the ten, and others, who went about to oppreſs them. And when it was requiſite they ſhould obey the Dictators, and the Conſuls, for the common ſafety, they did it likewiſe: and if the people of Rome deſired again <hi>Manlius Capitolinus</hi> being dead, it is no marvail; for they deſired his vertues, which had bin ſuch, that the remembrance of them mov'd every one to compaſſion, and might be of force likewiſe to work the ſame effect in a Prince: for it is the opinion of all writers, that vertue is commended even in ones ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. And if <hi>Manlius,</hi> in the midſt of that great deſire had bin reviv'd, the people of Rome would have given the ſame judgement upon him that they had done when they drew him out of priſon, and condemn'd him to death. In like manner we ſee there were ſome Princes eſteem'd wiſe too, that have put ſome men to death, whom afterwards they have much deſired again; as <hi>Alexander</hi> did <hi>Clitus,</hi> and others of his friends, and <hi>Herod Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amme.</hi> But that which our Hiſtorian ſpeaks touching the nature of the multitude, belongs not to that which is regulated by the lawes, as was that of the Romans, but to that which is looſe, as was that of the Syracuſians, which committed thoſe errors that men inraged and
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:30490:105"/>
diſſolute fall into, as did <hi>Alexander the Great,</hi> and <hi>Herod,</hi> in the caſes aforeſaid. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the nature of the multitude is not more blame-worthy, than that of Princes: for all equally do erre, when all without reſpect have power to erre. Whereof, beſides this I have alleadged, there are examples enough, as well among the Roman Emperors, as other Kings and Princes, where we may ſee ſuch unconſtancy and variation of life, as never was yet ſeen in any multitude. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude then, beyond the common opinion, which ſayes, that the people when they have the Principallity in their hands, are various, mutable, unthankfull, affirming that theſe faul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s are no otherwiſe in them, than they are in particular Princes. And if a man blamed both peoples and Princes together, he might ſay true; but exempting Princes, he is deceiv'd. For a people that rules, and is well in order, will be conſtant, prudent and gratefull, as well as a Prince, or better, though eſteem'd wiſe. And on the other ſide, a Prince looſen'd from the law will be unthankfull, various, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent, more than the people: and the diverſitie of their proceeding ariſes not from the diverſity of their diſpoſitions (becauſe in all of them it is much after one manner, and if there be any advantage on either ſide, it is on the peoples part) but rather that the one hath more regard to the lawes under which they live, than the other. And he that conſiders the people of Rome, ſhall find that for four hundred years the name of a King was hatefull to them, and yet were they zealous for the glory, and common good of their countrey: and he ſhall ſee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:30490:105"/>
examples among them that witneſs the one thing, and the other of them And if any man al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge to mee the unthankfulneſſe they uſed towards <hi>Scipio, I</hi> anſwer that which formerly at large was ſayd in this matter, where it was made plaine, that people are leſſe ungratefull than Princes. But as touching wiſedome, and ſettled ſtayedneſſe, I ſay that a people is wiſer and more ſtayd, and of more exact judgment than a Prince. And therefore not without cauſe the peoples voyce is likened to Gods voyce; for wee ſee that the univerſall opinions bring to paſſe rare effects in their preſages, ſo that it ſeemes by their ſecret vertues they foreſee their owne good or evill. And touching their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in things, it is ſeldome ſeene, that when they heare two Oratours, pleading each of them a contrary part, when they are both of equall worth, but that they follow the better opinion, and are very capable of the truth they heare. And if in matters of courage, or in things that appeare profitable (as it was aboveſayd) they erre, many times alſo does a Prince erre, drawne aſide by his owne paſſions, which are greater in them then in the people. We ſee likewiſe in their chooſing of Officers, they make a farre better choice then does a Prince. Nor will a people ever be perſwaded to advance to dignity a man infamous and of a corrupt life, to which a Prince may eaſily and diverſe wayes be brought. We ſee a people begin to hate ſome one thing, and continue many ages in the ſame opinion, which we ſee not it a Prince. And of the one and the other of theſe two things, the people of Rome ſhall ſerve me for witneſſe, which in ſo many hundreds of yeares, in ſo many electio<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                        </gap> of Conſulls and Tribuns,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:30490:106"/>
never made foure choices, whereof they had cauſe to repent them. And they hated ſo much (as I ſaid) the name of a King, that no citizen of theirs could ever ſo farre oblige them, that if once he affected the Royalty, they would par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don his due puniſhment. Moreover we ſee, that in thoſe cities where the Principality is in the people, in a ſhort time exceeding great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes are made, and farre greater then thoſe that have bin made under the government of a Prince, as Rome did after the baniſhment of her Kings, and Athens after ſhe freed her ſelfe from <hi>Piſiſtratue;</hi> which proceeds from nothing elſe, but that the peoples governments are better then Princes. Nor will we agree to this, that all that our Hiſtorian ſayes in the text before alleadged, or any where elſe, oppoſes this our opinion; for if we ſhall run over all the diſorders of peoples, &amp; the diſorders of Princes, and all the glorious actions of people, as thoſe alſo of Princes, we ſhall ſee the people farre ſurmount the Princes in vertue and in glory. And if Princes exceede the people in ordaining of Lawes, in framing a civill government, in making of ſtatutes and new inſtitutions, yet in the maintenance and preſervation hereof the people go ſo farre beyond them, that they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to the glory of their founders. And in ſumme, to conclude this matter, I ſay, that as Princes ſtates have laſted long, ſo likewiſe have thoſe of Republiques; and the one and the other have had need to be regulated by the lawes: for a Prince that hath the power to doe what he liſt, commits divers follies; and a people that can do what they will, ſeldome give great proofes of their wiſdome. If then the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be touching a Prince and a people tied
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:30490:106"/>
and chained to their lawes, a man ſhall ſee more vertue in the People, then in the Prince: but if the reaſoning be of the one and the other looſe from the lawes, fewer errours will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in the people then in the Prince; and thoſe leſſe, and which are capable of greater remedies: for a good man may eaſily have the meanes to perſwade with a licentious and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous people, and ſo reduce them to reaſon. But to a miſchievous Prince no man can ſpeake, nor is there any other remedy but the ſword. <note place="margin">☞ But this is ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy as hath no warrant from divine or humane lawes, eſpecially when that a Tyrant is the true and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Prince of the country, however that by his evill government and adminiſtration of the affaires he deſervedly be term'd a Tyrant.

When a people is riſen in tumult, the follies which they commit are not ſo perillous, nor is there ſuch feare to be had of the preſent evill, as of that which may befall, it being poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſome Tyrant may grow up in the midſt of that confuſion. But during the time of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous Princes the contrary happens; for the greateſt feare is of the preſent evill; and of the time to come there is hope, men eaſily perſwading themſelves, that his evill life may produce their liberty. So that a man may ſee
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:30490:107"/>
the difference between the one and the other; the deſperate feare of the one, is, of the preſent ſtate; of the other, of the ſtate into which it may fall. The multitudes cruelties are exercis'd againſt thoſe that they feare, leſt they ſhould ſeize upon the common good. The Princes againſt thoſe that they feare, leſt they ſhould ſeeke to recover their owne againe. But the opinion againſt the people growes dayly, for every one may freely ſpeake evill of the people without feare, even while they have the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in their hands. A man ſpeakes not evill of Princes, but with many fears and jealouſies. Nor is it much out of purpoſe (ſeeing the matter drawes me to it) to argue in the Chapter follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing, what Confederacies a man may beſt truſt to, either thoſe that be made with a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique, or that are made with a Prince.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>BEcauſe every day we have it, that one Prince with another, or one Republique with another make leagues, and joyne friendſhip together, and in like manner alſo confederacies are drawne and agreements made betweene a Republique and a Prince. I thinke to examine, which is the firmeſt league, whereof a man ſhould make ſureſt account of; either of that with a Republique, or the other with a Prince. And examining the whole, I beleeve that in many caſes they are alike, and in ſome there is ſome difference: and therefore, that
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:30490:108"/>
accords made by force ſhall not be truly kept thee neither by Prince nor commonwealth. And I thinke that when feare comes upon them touching their ſtate, as well the one as the other, rather then periſh, will breake their faith with thee, and requite thee with unthankfulneſſe. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius,</hi> he that was ever termed the taker of cities, had done exceeding much good to the Athenians; it chanc'd afterwards, that being routed by his enemies, and ſeeking refuge in Athens as in a city that was his friend, and much ingag'd to him, he was not admitted into it. Which griev'd him much more then the loſſe of his ſouldiers and army had done. <hi>Pompey</hi> when his army was routed by <hi>Caeſar</hi> in Theſſaly, fled into Egypt to <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> who formerly had bin reſtor'd by him into his kingdome, and was put to death by him. Which things we ſee had the ſame occaſions: yet more humanity and leſſe injury was us'd by the Republique, then by the Prince. Therefore where there is fear, a man ſhal finde in effect the ſame faith. And if there be any Commonwealth or Prince who to keepe their faith with thee, expect while they ruine, it may proceed alſo from the ſame occaſion. And as for a Prince, it may well chance, that he is allied to ſome powerfull Prince, who though he then hath not the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to defend him, yet may he well hope, that in time he may reſtore him into his ſtate, or elſe that having taken ſide with him as partiſan, he thinkes he cannot obtaine a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and fair accord with his enemy. Of this ſort were thoſe Princes of the Kingdome of Naples, that tooke part with the French. And for Republiques, of this ſort was Saguntum in Spaine, which till it was ruin'd tooke part
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:30490:108"/>
with the Romans; and ſo was Florence for ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with the French in the yeare one thouſand five hundred and twelve. And I believe, having ſumm'd up every thing, that in theſe caſes, where the danger is urgent, there is more aſſurance rather in the Republiques, then in the Princes: for though the Republiques were of the ſame minde and had the ſame intention as Princes had, yet for that they move but ſlowly, it will cauſe them to ſtay longer in reſolving themſelves, then a Prince will; and thereupon they will be longer a breaking their faith then he. Confederacies are broken for profit, Wherein Commonwealths are farre ſtricter in their obſervance of accords, then Princes. And we might bring many examples, where even for a very ſmall gaine a Prince hath broken his faith; and where exceeding great advantages could not one whit move a Commonwealth, as was the party <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> propounded to the Athenians, to whom in an oration made them he ſaid, that he could adviſe them ſo, that their country ſhould gaine much advantage by it, but them he might not tell it, for feare of diſcovering it, for by the diſcovery the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of doing it would be taken away. Whereupon the Athenians choſe <hi>Ariſtides,</hi> to whom he ſhould communicate this ſecret, and together with him conſult upon it: whom <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtocles</hi> ſhew'd how the whole navall army of all Greece was in their hands under their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, though intruſted them upon their faith, ſo that it was in their power by the ruine there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to make themſelves Lords of all Greece. Whereupon <hi>Ariſtides</hi> told the people that <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> advice was exceeding profitable, but very dishoneſt. For which cauſe the people
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:30490:109"/>
wholly reſus'd it, which <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon</hi> would not have done, nor thoſe other Princes who ſeeke their owne gaine rather, and have made more advantage by breaking their faith, than by any way elſe. Touching the breaking of agreements, upon the not obſervance of ſome particulars therein, I meane not to meddle with them, being ordinary matters; but I ſpeak of thoſe that breake upon extraordinary and maine points. Wherein, by what we have ſaid, I beleeve the people are leſſe faulty than the Princes, and therefore may better bee truſted than they.</p>

                        <p>How the Conſulſhip and every other Magiſtracie in Rome was given without reſpect of age.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IT appeares by order of the Story, that the Commonwealth of Rome, after that the Conſulſhip came among the people, beſtowed it upon their Citizens, without regard of yeares or bloud: and indeed they never had reſpect to age, but altogether aimed at vertue, whether it were in young, or old. Which wee perceive by the teſtimonie of <hi>Valerius Corvinus,</hi> who at 23. yeares of age was made Conſul. And the ſame <hi>Valerius,</hi> ſpeaking to his ſouldiers, ſayd, That <hi>the Conſulſhip was the reward of vertuc, and not of bloud.</hi> Which thing, <note place="margin">Erat praemium virtutis, non ſanguinis.</note> whether it were adviſedly ſayd or no, might require much diſpute. And touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bloud, this was yeelded to upon neceſſitie, and this neceſſitie that was in Rome might be in every Citie that would doe the ſame things Rome did, as otherwhere is ſayd: for toyle,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:30490:109"/>
and labour cannot be impoſed on men without reward; nor can their hopes of obtaining re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward bee taken from them, without danger. And therefore it was fit timely to give them hope of the Conſulſhip, and by this hope were they a while fed without having it; at length that hope ſerved not, but there was a neceſſity to come to performance with them. But the Citie that imployes not their people in any glorious action may treate the mafter their owne manner, as other where it was argued. But that which will take the ſame courſe Rome tooke, muſt make this diſtinction. And grant that it be ſo, for that of time there is no reply: nay rather it is neceſſary; for in the chooſing of a young man into a degree which hath need of the diſcretion of an old man, it is likely (the people being to make the choyce) that ſome very worthy and noble action of his preferres him thereto. And when a young man becomes endowed with ſuch vertues that hee hath made himſelf famous by his heroicke actions, it were a very great wrong, that that Citie might not ſerve her ſelfe of him then, but ſhould be put off to expect, till that vigour and quickneſſe of ſpirit were grown old and dull, whereof in that age his country might have made good uſe, as Rome did of <hi>Valerius Corvinus,</hi> of <hi>Scipio,</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> and many others, that triumphed very young.</p>

And when this their opinion is falſe, as moſt commonly it is, I perſwade my ſelf the reaſons that bring them into this error, are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. And the firſt I take to be, that of matters of old the truth is not wholly known, &amp; of thoi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For moſt wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters do ſo much follow the conquerors fortune, that to make their victories glorious, they not only augment what they have vertuouſly done
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:30490:110"/>
but they ſo illuſtrate their enomies actions, that thoſe that are afterwards born in any of their countreys, either conquering or conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, have cauſe to admire thoſe men and times, and ſo conſequently are forc'd exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly to praiſe and love them. Beſides this, men hating things either for fear, or envic, two very powerfull cauſes of hatred are quite ſpent in things that are paſſed, being they are not able to hurt, nor can give occaſion of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vic. But on the contrary part, it comes to paſs that thoſe things that are now in hand, and we ſee, which by reaſon of the through know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge we have of them, no tittle thereof being conceal'd from us, and knowing in them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the good, many things worthy diſlike, hereupon we are compell'd to judge them much Inferior to matters of old, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that in truth the preſent deſerve far more glory and reputation: this I ſay, not arguing touching the arts, which are now brought to ſuch perfection, that the times can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not take from them, nor add but little more glory to them; but ſpeaking of things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to means lives and manners, whereof the proofes are not very evident; I anſwer, that this cuſtome above written of praiſing and blaming is ſometimes falſe and ſometimes true: for ſometimes they muſt needs light upon the truth; becauſe all humane things are continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in motion, and either riſe or fall. As we ſee the civil government of a city or countrey ſo ordain'd by ſome rare perſon, that for a time even by reaſon of the worth of this man, the State mends much, and is more and more amplified: he that is then borne in that State, and commends more the times of old, than
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:30490:111"/>
thoſe moderne, is much deceiv'd: and the cauſe of his errour proceeds from thoſe things that have bin formerly ſayd. But thoſe that are afterwards born in that City or countrie, whoſe dayes are onely during their decline from their excellence, then erre nor. And I deviſing with my ſelfe whence theſe things proceed, I think the world hath continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alwayes in one manner, and that in i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> hath beene alwayes as much good as evill; but that that good and evill does change from country to country, as it appeares by that which is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd to us of thoſe ancient kingdomes, which alter'd from the one to the other, by change of manners. But the world continued the ſame. There was onely this difference, that where it firſt had plac'd its vertue in Aſſiria, it afterwards remov'd it into Media, then into perſia, in ſo much that at length it came into Italie, and ſo to Rome. And if after the Romane Empire there ſucceeded not any other that laſted, nor where the world had retired all its vertue together; yet we ſee it was ſpread abroad into ſeverall Nations, where men behav'd themſelves very bravely and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louroufly, as in the Kingdome of France, the Kingdome of the Turks, and that of the Soldan; ſo now adayes in Germanie, and ſo among thoſe that were firſt of the Saracin ſect, which did great exploits, and made themſelves maſters of ſo great a part of the world, after they had deſtroyed the Eaſterne Empire of Rome. In all theſe Provinces then, after the Romanes were ruined, and in all theſe ſects hath that vertue reſided; and now in ſome of them indeed it may be wiſhed for, but in other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome worthily commended. And he that is
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:30490:111"/>
borne in thoſe Countries, and praiſes the times paſt more than the preſent, may be deceived: but he that is borne in Italy and not in Greece, and is not become ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Italy, a Tramontan, or in Greece, a Turk, hath reaſon to blame the times pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and commend the former, for therein were many things made them marvail, but in theſe there is nothing can recover them out of extream miſery, infamy, and diſgrace, where there is no obſervance either of Religion or Lawes, nor of warlike diſcipline, but they are wholly beſpotted with all manner of filthineſs. And ſo much the more deteſtable are theſe vices, by how much they are moſt in thoſe that are greateſt, who ſitting in their Tribunals command all, and will be ador'd. But returning to our diſcourſe, I ſay, that if mens underſtandings are corrupted in matter of judgment, touching which age is the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the preſent or that of old, in thoſe things by reaſon of their antiquitie they could not have ſuch an exact knowledge, as they might have of their own times, yet ſhould they not be corrupted in old men touching the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the times of their youth, and old age, having known and ſeen equally the one and the other; Which thing would be true, if thoſe men all the time of their lives continued ſtill at the ſame ſtate of judgement, and had the ſame deſires. But they altering, though the times, change not, yet cannot ſeem ſo to men to continue the ſame, they having other deſires, other delights, and other conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in their old age, than in their youth: for the ſtrength of mens bodies, when they grow old, decaying, and their judgements and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:30490:112"/>
increaſing, as muſt needs be, that thoſe things which in their youths they thought ſupportable and good, becomes afterwards to them growing old intollerable and hurtfull: and where theſe men ought herein to lay the fault upon their own judgements, they blame the times. Beſides this, the deſire of man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inſatiable (becauſe of nature he hath it, that he can and will deſire every thing, though of fortune he be ſo limited, that he can attain but a few) there ariſes thence a diſlike in mens minds, and a loathing of the things they injoy which cauſes them to blame the times preſent and commend thoſe paſs'd, as alſo thoſe that are to come, although they have no motives grounded upon reaſon to incite them thereto. I know not then, whether I ſhall deſerve to be numbred among them that are deceiv'd; if too much in theſe diſcourſes of mine I ſhall praiſe the times of the ancient Romans, and blame our own. And truly if the vertue that then reign'd, and the vice that now reigns, were not more clear than the Sun, I ſhould not ſpeak ſo freely, for fear I ſhould incur the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of that error whereof I have now blam'd others: but the matter being ſo evident, that every man ſees it, I ſhall with boldneſs ſpeak that plainly which I conceive of thoſe &amp; theſe times, to the end thoſe young men who ſhall chance to read theſe my writings, may avoyd the evil of theſe times, and prepare their minds to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itate the good of theſe of old, whenſoever their good, fortune ſhall give them occaſion: for it is the duty of a good man, to reach unto others that good, which by reaſon of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity of the times, and of fortune, thou haſt not bin able to do thy ſelf, to the end that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

                        <p>Which contributed more to the Romans in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of their Empire, either their virtue, or their fortune.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>MAny have bin of opinion, among whom is <hi>Plutarch</hi> a great Writer, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Rome were more favor'd by fortune, than aſſiſted by their vertues, in gaining their Empire. And among other reaſons which he alleadges to that purpoſe, he ſayes, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the confeſſion of the ſame people, that they acknowledged all their victories from fortune, having conſecrated more Temples to her, than to any other god. And <hi>Livie</hi> ſeems to ſide with this opinion: becauſe it is very ſeldome, that he brings in any Roman ſpeaking where he makes mention of vertue, but that he joynes fortune therewith. Whereunto I will not yield in any termes, nor think I it can be maintain'd: for if never any Republique made the ſame Progreſs that Rome made; it is becauſe never hath any Republique bin ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd to make its advantage, as Rome was: for the valour of their armies gain'd them their Empire, and their order of proceeding, and
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:30490:113"/>
their own mannor with that which their firſt founder likewiſe deviſed for them, made them keep what they had gotten, as hereafter in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral diſcourſes ſhall be declar'd. That two ſtrong wars never at the ſame time met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſhake their ſtate, they ſay, it was the people of Romes fortune, and not their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor: for they had no wars with the Latins, til they had not onely beaten the Samnites, but were fain to undertake a war in defence of them. Neither war'd they with the Tuſcans, til they had firſt ſubdued the Latins, and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weakned the Samnices with many routes: whereof if two entire powers (when they were freſh) had joyned together againſt the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, without doubt a man may eaſily conject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure that the ruine of the Roman Republique would have followed thereupon. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever this thing came to paſs, it never befell them to have two ſtrong wars made againſt them at once, but rather luckily it proov'd, that when one began, the other ended, and at the end of one another began, Which we may eaſily ſee, by viewing their wars, how they followed in order: for letting alone thoſe wars which they made before Rome was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the Frenchmen, we ſee, that whileſt they fought with the <hi>Aequi</hi> and the <hi>Volſci,</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver (ſo long as theſe people were of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable power) did any other people ſet upon them. They they being conquer'd, the war againſt the Samnites began; and though be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the finiſhing of this war the Latins Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel'd againſt the Romans, nevertheleſs, when that rebellion followed, the Samnites were in league with Rome, and with their army help'd the Romans to bring down the Latins pride;
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:30490:113"/>
and when they were ſubdued, the war with the Samnites again was reviv'd. But their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces being broken by divers defeats given them, the war with the Tuſcans aroſe; and when that was quieted, the Samni es began anew to ſtir, upon <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> has paſſage into Italy; when he was defeated, and beaten back into Greece, then firſt was kindled the fire of the Carthaginian wars: nor was that quenched til that all the French, as well beyond, as on this ſide the Alpes, conſpired againſt the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans; ſo that between <hi>Pobolonia</hi> and <hi>Piſa,</hi> where now is the tower at Saint <hi>Vincenti,</hi> they were vanquiſh'd with a very great ſlaughter. After this, for the ſpace of 20 years, they had not any war of much importance: for they had no quarrel with any but with the Ligu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, and the remainder of thoſe French that werein Lombardie: and ſo they continued, til the ſecond Carrhaginian war begin; Which troubled Italie for 16 years ſpace. Which being made an end of with great glory, that of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon</hi> ſprung up, and was ended, when that of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> and afterwards that of Aſia took their turns. After which victorie, there remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not in the whole world neither Prince nor Republique that either by themſelves or alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether could oppoſe the Roman Forces. But before that laſt victory, he that conſiders the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of theſe wars, and the manner of their proceeding, ſhall find mingled with their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune much valour and wiſdome; ſo that he who examines the occaſion of ſuch fortune, ſhall eaſily diſcover it: for it is very certain, that when a Prince or a people have gained ſuch a reputation, that neither prince
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:30490:114"/>
nor people bordering upon him dares by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf aſſault him, and is afraid of him, it will alwaies ſo fall out, that none of them all will ſet upon him, unleſs forc'd thereto, ſo that it ſhall be at that great Princes choyce, to war with which of his neighbors he ſhall pleaſe, and the reſt with little pains to quiet. Who, partly in regard of his power, partly beguil'd by ſome devices he ſhall make uſe of to lull them aſleep, are eaſily kept from ſtirring. And for other powerfull Princes, who are more remote and have no dealing with him, they look upon the matter, as a thing afar off, and nothing belonging to them. In which error they continue ſo long, til the fire comes cloſe to their doors: which then being come ſo near, they have no means to extinguiſh it, but only to uſe their own armes, which ſuffice nor, the enemy being now grown exceeding migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. I will let paſs, how the Samnites ſtood ſtill and look'd upon the Romans, while they overcame the <hi>Volſci</hi> and the <hi>Aequi:</hi> and that I may not be too tedious, I will ſatisfie my ſelf with the Carthaginians, who were of great power and eſtimation, when the Romans war'd with the Samnites and Tuſcans: for even then they were Maſters of all Affrica, and had Sardinia and Scicily in their hands, and had the rule of ſome part of Spain. Who being that their forces were remote from the people of Romes confines, never thought of aſſaulting them, nor of giving ſuccours to the Samnites, and Tuſcans; but as if the Romans increaſe had bin the Carthaginians advantage, they made a confederacy with them, ſeeking their friendſhip: nor did they perceive their error committed, til the Romans having ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:30490:114"/>
all thoſe peoples that lay between them and the Carthaginians, began to make war with them for the rule of Scicily and Spain. The ſelf-ſame befell the French, that hapned to the Carthaginians, and ſo to <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon,</hi> and <hi>Antiochus;</hi> and every one of them belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved (while the Romans were buſy with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) that that other might chance to vanquiſh them, and that they had time enough, either by peace or war, to defend themſelves from them. So that, I beleeve, that the ſame for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune herein the Romans had, all Princes would have had, provided, that they proceeded as the people of Rome did, and were of equal valour with them. To this purpoſe it would not be unfit, to declare the courſe the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Rome held in their entryes into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Princes countreys, but that inour trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Principallities, we have diſcourſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon at laege. I will only ſay this in brieſ, they alwaies did put in practice to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſome friends in the Countreys they came newly acquainted with, who ſerved them for a ladder to climb up to them, or a gate to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them, or a tye to hold them; as it appears, by means of the Capuans they enterd into Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium, by the Camertins into Tuſcany, by the Mamertins into Scicly, by the Saguntins into Spain, by <hi>Mafiniſſa</hi> into Affrica, by the Ae o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians into Greece, by <hi>Eumenes</hi> and other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces into Aſia, by the Maſilians and the Heduans into France. And ſo they never fail'd of the like ſupports, whereby to facilitate their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings, either in the inlargement of their dominions, or in the maintaining them. Which, thoſe people that ſhall obſerve, ſhall find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in leſs want of good fortune, than they
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:30490:115"/>
who neglect it. And to the end, that every one may know of what avail our vertue was beyond their for une, in the conqueſt of their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, we will treat in the Chapter following, concerning the quality of thoſe people with whom they were to make war, and with what obſtinacy they defended their liberty.</p>

                     <p>NOthing made it more painfull to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans to vanquiſh their neighbors near a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, as alſo ſome other Countreys fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther off, then the affection that in thoſe days many people did bear to their liberty, which they ſo obſtinately defended, that they had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bin ſubdu'd, but by an exceſſive valour: for, by many examples, we know to what dangers they expos'd themſelves, as well for the maintenance as the recovery of it; and what revenges they took againſt thoſe that had laid hold on it. We know likewiſe what dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages peoples and cities receive by ſervitude And whereas now adayes, there is onely one Countrey that can ſay, ſhe hath free Cities in her: in ancient-times people liv'd very free in all countreys. We ſee that in thoſe times whereof at this preſent we ſpeak, in Italy from the Alpes (which make a partition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Tuſcany and Lombardy) even to the very point of Italy, there were many free peoples, as were the Tuſcans, the Romans the Samnites, and many others, that dwelt in the other parts of Italy: nor does any man relate, that there was any King, beſides thoſe
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:30490:115"/>
that raign'd in Rome, and Porſena King of Tuſcany; whoſe race how it came to an end, hiſtory leaves us no memory. But we plainly ſee, that at the ſame time the Romans went to incamp before Vejum, Tuſcany was free, and ſo abſolutely injoy'd their liberty, and withall ſo much hated the name of a Prince, that the inhabitants of Vejum for their defence having made a King among them, ask'd aid of the Tuſcans againſt the Romans; but they reſolv'd after many deliberations taken, to give them none whiles they liv'd under a King, judging it not right to defend their countrey, who of themſelves had ſubjected it to another. And it is an eaſy thing to gue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s, whereupon it is that people take ſuch an affection to their liberty: becauſe we ſee by experience, that cities have never bin much amplified neither in domition nor riches, unleſs only during their liberty. And truly it is a ſtrange thing to conſider, unto what greatneſs Athens attained in the ſpace of a hundred years, after ſhe had freed her ſelf from <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> his tyranny: but above all it is moſt ſtrange to think unto what greatneſs Rome attained after ſhe was deliver'd from her Kings: The reaſon thereof is eaſy to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood: for it is no mans particular go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>, but the common good, that amplifies the city. And without queſtion this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good is not regarded but in Republiques, for there whatſoever makes for their advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage is put in practice: and though it turns to this or that private mans loſs, yet are they ſo many, whom the ſaid good concerns, that they are alwaies able to put it forward, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight of thoſe few that ſuffer by it.

pines thereupon? as from the ſwelling of the ſpleen, the health of the whole body is diſturb'd, and therefore by ſome Politiques not unfitly compared to a Princes exchequer, which when it exceſſively abounds beggers the whole countrey. And <hi>it is a folly to think</hi> (ſaith a Spauiſh author) <hi>that the poverty of the Comminalty will not redound to the breaking of private patrimonies, nor can great revenues continue there, where the Commonwealth is rack'd to the very bones.</hi> All theſe things ſerve to argue the mutual ſympathy, as between the head and the members, ſo between the Prince and his ſubjects; and to divide the intereſt of the Prince from that of the people, cannot agree with good policy; for as in the natural body it breeds diſeaſes, ſo in the politique it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces diſorder and deſtruction.</note> growes upon a free ſtate, the leaſt ill that can thence reſult to thoſe cities, is not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, nor increaſe more in power, nor wealth: but for the moſt part, or rather alwaies, it comes to paſs, that they go back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: And if hap would have it, that a Tyranc ſhould proove valorous, who by his courage and proweſs ſhould inlarge his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, there would thence no profit ariſe to the Republique, but to him alone: for he cannot advance any of theſe citizens that are brave and worthy, over whom he tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizes, unleſs he deſires to give himſelf ſome jeulouſy of them. Nor can he yet ſubject or make tributary the cities that he conquers, to that city which he tyrannizes over; for it is not for his advantage to make it pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull; it rather makes for him, to hold
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:30490:117"/>
the ſtate disjoyn'd, that each town and province acknowledge him, in ſo much that of his conqueſts, he onely reaps he good, and not his countrey. And he hat would ſee the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of this opinion, let him read <hi>Xenophon</hi> in his treaty of a Tyranny It is no marval then, that the peoples of old did ſo extreamly harc Tyrants, and lov'd the free gouernment, &amp; that the very name of liberty was in ſuch requeſt amongſt them: as it happen'd, when <hi>Hierony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> nephew of <hi>Hiero</hi> the Siracuſan, was ſlain in Siracuſa: for the news of his death being brought to his army, which lay not far from the city, they began to riſe up in tumult, and take their armes in hand againſt them that ſlew him: but when they perceiv'd that in Siracuſa all cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out liberty, allured with the delight of that name, they were all appeas'd, and laid aſide their anger conceiv'd againſt them that kil'd the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, &amp; advis'd together by what means there might be ordain'd in that city a free govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And it is no marvail, that people take extraordinary revenge of thoſe that have laid hold of their liberty. Touching which there are many examples, whereof I intend to relate one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one, that fell out in <hi>Corcira</hi> a City of Greece, in the times of the <hi>Peloponneſian</hi> wat: where the province being divided into two factions, one of which followed the Athenians, the other the Spartans; it came to paſs, that of many cities which were divided among themſelves, the one part follow'd the friendſhip of the Spartans, the other that of Athens; it happening ſo, that in the ſaid city the Nobility prevail'd, and tooke from the people their liberty; but the people by means of the Athenians took heare again, and having laid hold on the Nobility, ſhut
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:30490:117"/>
them up into a priſon capable of them all, from whence they drew them out by eight and by ten at a time, pretending to baniſh them into ſeverall parts, but they put them to death after a cruell manner. Whereof they that remain'd having ſome notice, reſolv'd as much as lay in their power, to avoid this ſhamefull death; ſo that arm'd with what they could get, and fighting with thoſe that ſought to enter, they defende'd the paſſage into the priſon: whereupon, the people running together uncovered the top of the houſe, and with the ruines thereof overwhelm'd them. There follow'd alſo in the ſaid province many ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther horrible chances, ſo that we find it true, that people purſue more agerly the revenge of a liberty once taken from them actually, then of that which was onely contriv'd in the intention to be pluck'd from them. Weighing then from whence it may ariſe, that in the times of old people eſteem'd more of liberty, then now a dayes, I beleeve it proceeds from the ſame cauſe which makes men leſſe valiant now adayes then formerly, which I thinke is the difference of our educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from that of old, grounded upon the difference of our Religion from the ancient: for our Religion having ſhew'd <note place="margin">* Here <hi>Machia.</hi> falſely imputes the cauſe of mens cowardlineſſe to Chriſtian Religion. I need not alleadge any battells fought by the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, to proove him a lyar; hiſtories fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently affoard us examples, as well ancient as moderne, where they have bin as reſolutely fought by the Chriſtians, as ever were any by the Pagans: nay our owne memories may well ſupply us with ſome if we want. If we marke from whence <hi>Machiavell</hi> takes his argument, it is from that the Pagans ſlew a multitude of ſacrifices, the ſight of which being terrible made men of theſame diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. By the ſame reaſon muſt it follow that our butchers and ſurgeons are more valiant then other men, as who cuſtomarily have their hands imbrued in bloud: I may well allow them to be more cruell, and therefore our lawes exclude them from being of the Iury of life and death: but of being more valiant I never heard they had the reputation.</note> us the truth,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:30490:118"/>
and the true way, cauſes us leſſe to make account of the honour of this world; whereupon the Gentiles eſteeming much of it, and placing therein their greateſt good, became braver in their actions. Which may be conſider'd from many of their orders, beginning from the magnificence of their ſacrifices and the poore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ours, where indeede the pompe is more delicate then magnificke, but not any action of bravery or fierceneſſe. And with the Gentiles alſo there was no want of pompe and magnificence in the ceremonies, but thereunto was added the action of the ſacrifice full of bloud and cruelty, ſlaying a multitude of beaſts; The ſight of which being terrible made men of the ſame diſpoſition. Beſides, the ancient Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on did not beatificate but onely men fraught with worldly glory, as were the Commanders of armies, and Princes of nations. Our Religion hath rather glorified humble and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plative men, then thoſe of action. Moreover it hath plac'd the chiefe good in humility, and in the rejecting and contempt of worldly things. That other imagin'd the chiefe happineſſe to conſiſt in the greatneſſe of courage, in the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:30490:118"/>
ſtrength of body, and in all other things fit to make men exceeding valiant: and if our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion requires valour in a man, it is rather that he be fit for a ſtrong ſufferance, then for a ſtrong action. This manner of living then, as it ſeemes, hath made the world become feeble, and given it in prey to wicked perſons, who may ſecurely rule over it, as they liſt, ſeeing that all men to obtaine paradiſe, think rather of ſuffering their wrongs, then revenging them: and though it may appeare, that the world is growne effeminate, and the heavens diſarm'd, it proceeds without doubt from the cowardiſe of men, who have given an interpretation of our Religion according to their owne lazy and idle diſpoſitions, and not agreeable to vertue: for if they would conſider how much it allowes the advancement and defence of ones country, they ſhould ſee that it wills, that we ſhould love and honour it, and ſo prepare our ſelves that we may be able to defend it. Theſe kindes of educations then, and falſe interpretations, cauſe that there be not ſo many Republiques now adayes in the world as were of old. Nor by conſequence do we ſee among people ſuch an affection to liberty as formerly: although I beleeve rather the reaſon hereof is, becauſe the Roman Empire with its force and power extinguiſh'd all the Republiques and free governments. And though afterwards that Empire was diſſolv'd, yet could not the cities againe be reſtor'd, and anew order'd in a civill government, unleſſe it were in very few places of that Empire. Yet howſoever it was, the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans in every little corner of the world found, as it were, a conſpiracy of Commonwealths very ſtrongly arm'd, and very obſtinate to
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:30490:119"/>
defend their liberties; which ſhewes that the people of Rome without an extraordinary and rare valour had never made conqueſt of them. And to give an example of ſome member thereof, that of the Samnires ſhall ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ffice me: who (and indeed it is admirable, and ſo <hi>Titus Livius</hi> avowes it) were ſo powerfull and warlike, that they were of force, till the time of <hi>Papirius Curſor</hi> the Conſul, ſonne of the firſt <hi>Papirius,</hi> to reſiſt the Romans, which was for the ſpace of forty ſix yeares, after ſo many routes, deſtruction of their townes, and ſo many ſlaughters made in their country: eſpecially conſidering the country then, where ſo many cities were, and ſuch a vaſt number of men, though now almoſt not inhabited. And then there was ſuch order, and ſo great force, that it was inſuperable, had it not bin aſſaulted by a Roman power. And it is an eaſy thing to know, whence that order and this diſorder ariſe, for all that came from the free manner of living then, and this from the ſlavery now. For all countries and provinces which live free in every part, as formerly I ſaid, make exceeding large progreſſes: for here we ſee the people more numerous, becauſe the marriages are more free, and deſir'd by men: being that every one will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly begets thoſe children which he beleeves he can bring up, and nouriſh, without doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their patrimony will be raviſh'd from them; and when he knowes they are borne free and not ſlaves, ſo that by meanes of their vertue they may become Princes. We ſee riches likewiſe increaſe there in greater meaſure, as well thoſe which ariſe from cultivation, as thoſe which are gotten by the trades of handicrafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: for every one is more provident in
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:30490:119"/>
gaining and multiplying of thoſe goods, which, when he hath gotten, he beleeves he ſhall peaceably injoy. From whence it comes to paſſe, that men even contend who ſhall more advance the private and publique good; ſo that the one and the other increaſe exceedingly. The contrary hereof followes in al thoſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries that live in ſervitude; and ſo much the more faile they of their accuſtomed good, by how much their ſervitude is harder. And of all hard ſervitudes, none exceeds that which is ſubject to a free Republique, becauſe ordinarily it is of longeſt continuance, and ſo leaſt hopes there are of being deliver'd from it: a ſecond reaſon is, the end of a Republique is to enfeeble and weaken all other bodies in her, whereby to augment her owne. Which thing a Prince that brings thee under his rule does not, eſpecially if it be not ſome Barbarian Prince, a ruiner of countries, and a deſtroyer of all ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill ſocietyes among men, as are the eaſterne Princes. But if any of them have bin inſtructed in humane cuſtomes and the arts ordinary among men, they moſt commonly affect equality in the cities they have ſubdued, and let them ſtill poſſeſſe all their arts and ancient cuſtomes; ſo that, if they cannot increaſe, as in liberty, they goe not to wracke, as in thraldome, ſpeaking of that thraldome into which cities fall, when they ſerve a ſtranger; for I have formerly ſpoken enough of ſubjection to a native. Whoſoever then conſiders well all that which is ſaid, will not much marvaile at the power which the Samnites had being free, nor at their weakeneſſe into which afterwards they fell by ſervitude. And <hi>Titus Livius</hi> gives us good teſtimony thereof in many places, in <hi>Hanniballs</hi>

And this is done two wayes, either by love or by force: by love holding the wayes open and ſecure to ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that might have a deſign to come and dwell in it, to the end that every one might come willingly to inhabit it; by force ruining and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facing the neighbour cities and ſending out the inhabitants thereof to dwell in thine: all which was punctually obſerv'd in Rome, ſo that in the timeof the ſixth King in Rome there dwelt 80
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:30490:120"/>
thouſand men able to beare armes: for the Romans meant to behave themſelves like the good husbandman, who to make a plant grow big, and fructify, and ripen well its fruits, cuts off the firſtſprouts it thruſts forth, that ſo the vertue thereof remaining yet in the roote of the plant, may ſhortly after bring forth others more lively and fruitfull. And that this courſe held was neceſſary and good for the founding and inlarging of an Empire, the Example of Sparta and Athens ſhewes us plaine, who being both very warlike Republiques, and furniſhed with excellent lawes, yet could they never attaine to the Roman Empires greatneſſe, which ſeemed indeed a little more tumultuary and not ſo well ordered as they, whereof can be alleadged no other reaſon, then that aforeſaid. For Rome having inlarged by thoſe two wayes the body of her city, was able to put in armes ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and 80 thouſand ſouldiers, whereas Sparta and Athens never exceeded each of them twenty thouſand men. Which proceeded not from that the ſcituation of Rome was more bountifull then theirs, but onely from the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent courſe they tooke: for <hi>Licurgus</hi> founder of the Spartan Republique conſidering that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could ſoone take away the power of his lawes, then a commixtion of new inhabitants, did what he could to hinder ſtrangers from living with them; and that they ſhould neither joyne matrimonies with them, nor admit them into their civill government, nor have any thing to do with them, which are the ordinary occaſions of accord among men. He ordained likewiſe that leather money ſhould paſſe cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, thereby to take from every one the defire to come thither and bring any merchandiſe,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:30490:121"/>
or art to them: ſo that, that citie could never grow big by multiplying her inhabitants. And becauſe all our actions imitate nature, it is neither poſſible, nor naturall, that the ſlender body of a tree ſhould beare a groſſe bough; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a ſmal Republique cannot hold cities nor kingdomes of greater power and ſtrength then ſhe her ſelfe is; and if perchance it comes to paſſe that ſhe layes hold on them, it befalls her as it does that tree the boughs whereof are greater then the body, that ſuſtaining it with much adoe, with every ſmall b'aſt it is broken, as we ſee it happen'd to Sparta: which having ſeized on the rule of all the cities of Greece, Thebes no ſooner rebell'd againſt her, but all the other cities likewiſe fell from her, and ſo remain'd as the dead trunk of a tree without branches: which could never befall Rome, having her body and ſtocke ſo huge, that it was of force with eaſe to ſupport any bough whatſoever. This manner then of proceeding, together with thoſe others which we ſhall afterwards ſpeake of, made Rome exceeding great and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.

                        <p>Republiques have taken three particular courſes, to amplifie and inlarge their ſtates.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>HE that hath read the ancient hiſtories with obſervation, findes that Commonwealths have three manner of wayes to amplify their ſtates. The one hath bin that which the ancient Tuſcans followed, to make a league of many Republiques together, where no
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:30490:121"/>
one is preſerred before the other, neither in authority nor in dignity; and to make other cities partakers with them in their gains; juſt as now adayes the Swiſſes do, and formerly in Greece the Achaeans and Eto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians were wont. And becauſe the Romans had much war with the Tuſcans, the better to ſhew the quality of this firſt way, I will inlarge my ſelf in giving notice of them par ieularly. Before the Romans had any great power in Italy, the Tuſcans were very mighty both by ſea and by land: and though there is no particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar hiſtory that touches their affairs, yet is there ſome ſmall remembrance thereof, and ſome ſignes left us of their greatneſs; and we know, how they ſent a colony to the ſea coaſt above, called by them Adria, which prooved of ſuch renown, that it gave the name to that ſea, and the Latins call it the Adri tick to this day. Moreover we know, that they had conquered all from Tiber, to the very foot of the Alpes, which encompaſs the whole body of Italy. Notwithſtanding that two hundred years before the Romans grew to any conſiderable ſtrength, the ſaid Tuſcans loſt the dominion of that countrey which is now called Lombar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; Which was ſeized on by the French; who either driven by neceſſity, or allured by the delicacy of the fruits, eſpecially the wines, came into Italy under the conduct of <hi>Belloveſus</hi> their Captain, and having defeated and chaſed out the natives; ſeated themſelves in that place, therein built many cities, and called the Countrey Gallia, from the name they then bare; and this they held til they were conquered by the Romans. The Tuſcans then liv'd with that equality, and
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:30490:122"/>
proceeded in the amplifying their State, in that firſt manner, ſpoken of before: and there were twelve Cities, among which were Clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſium, Vejum, Deſola, Aretium, and Volaterra and the like; who by way of league rul'd their dominions; nor could they inlarge their conqueſts beyond the bounds of Italy, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of alſo there was a great part left untoucht by them, for the reaſons which we ſhall after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards tell. The other manner is to make allies, yet not ſo thought, that thou ſtill reſerveſt not to thy ſelf the principal place in the command &amp; rule and title of all the exploits, which courſe was alwaies obſerv'd by the Romans. The third manner is, to make them immediatly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and not allies, as did the Spa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>tans and Athenians: of which three waies, this laſt is altogether unprofitable; as it appears, it was in the two foreſaid Republiques, which, for no other cauſe went to ruine, but for poſſeſſing themſelves of thoſe dominions, which they were not able to hold. For it is a thing of great difficulty and pains to hold the government of Cities by violence, eſpecially of thoſe that have bin accuſtomed to live free. And if thou beeſt not in armes, and well furniſhed with good numbers of ſoldiers, thou canſt neither com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, nor rule them. And to be able to do this, it is neceſſary to make friends and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, who may aſſiſt thee in multiplying the people of thy City. And becauſe theſe two Cities, did neither the one nor the other of theſe, their manner of proceeding was of no advantage to them. And becauſe Rome which gives us an example touching this third manner, did the one and the other, therefore grew it to that exceſſive power: and for that
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:30490:122"/>
ſhe alone took this courſe of living, ſhe alone therefore became ſo mighty: For ſhe having taken to her throughout all Italy many for her companions to help her, who in many things liv'd with her upon equal termes; but on the other ſide, as is aboveſaid, reſerving to her ſelf alwaies the ſeat of the Empire, and the title of commanding, theſe their companions (who were never aware of it) with their own pains &amp; loſs of their own bloud came to bring their own necks to the yoke: for when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to tranſport their Armies out of Italy, and to reduce Kingdomes into Provinces, &amp; to make thoſetheir ſubjects, who for that they were uſed to live under Kings, were never much troubled to become Subjects; and receiving Roman Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors over them, and having bin overcome by Armies, whereof the Romans had the name and title, they acknowledged no other head, but Rome. So that thoſe allyes of Rome that were in Italy, found themſelves on a ſudden be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>girt round by Romes Subjects, and oppreſſ'd by an exceeding vaſt City, as then Rome was: and when they perceiv'd the deceit into which they had bin train'd, it was too late to help it, Rome had then gotten ſuch authority with forrein Nations, and was then of ſuch ſtrength within it ſelf, the people of their City being grown very numerous and warlike. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though thoſe their companions, to be reveng'd on them for theſe injuries, conſpir'd together againſt them, yet in a ſhort time were they loſers by the war, making their own condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions worſe: for of allies, they became Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. Which manner of proceeding (as is ſaid) hath bin obſerv'd onely by the Romans: nor
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:30490:123"/>
can a Republique that would enlarge her State take any other; for experience hath not ſhew'd us any courſe more certain or true. This way formerly ſpoken of concerning the leagues, wherein anciently the Tuſcans, Acheans, and Aeroſians liv'd, and which now adayes the Swiſſes uſe, is the better way next after that the Romans took: for, it being not poſſible by it to grow very great, thou gaineſt two advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages thereby, the one, that eaſily thou draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt no war upon thee; the other, that what thou getteſt thou eaſily holdeſt. The reaſon why they cannot grow great, is, becauſe they are diſunited Republiques, and placed in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſeats; which makes it more difficult to conſult and reſolve. And beſides, becauſe they are not very greedy of extending the limits of their dominions; for that divers Commonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties being to participate of that rule, they va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue not ſo much ſuch conqueſts, as does a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique alone, which hopes to injoy it all her ſelf. Moreover, they govern themſelves by common advice and counſel, and therfore of force they muſt be ſlower in every deliberation, then they that live within the walls of the ſame City. It is plain alſo by experience, that this manner of proceeding preſcribes it ſelf certain bounds, which it paſſes not; nor have we any example that they were exceeded. And theſe were to joyn together ſome dozen or fourteen Commonalties, and afterwards never ſeek to go beyond that: for being come to thoſe terms, that they think they are able to defend themſelves againſt every one, they deſire no greater power, as well becauſe neceſſity does not bind them to have greater force; as alſo becauſe they underſtand not any great profits
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:30490:123"/>
that ariſe from ſuch like purchaſes, for the cauſes formerly alledged: for then of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity they muſt either go on forward to make themſelves allyes, and ſo the multitude would make a confuſion; or els to make them their ſubjects: and becauſe they ſee herein many difficulties, and no great advantage in holding them, they make no account of them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, when they have attaind to ſuch greatneſs, that they think they may live ſecure, they apply themſelves to two things; the one to entertain others in their protection, and undertake their defences, and by theſe means to draw money from every part, which they can very eaſily divide among one another, and the other to ſerve in the wars under another, and to take pay of this or that Prince, who gives them wages for their ſervice, as now adayes the Switzers do, and as we read, thoſe we ſpoke of before did, whereof <hi>Titus Livius</hi> bears witneſs, where he ſayes, that when <hi>Philip</hi> King of Macedon came to a parley with <hi>Titus Quintius Flamminius,</hi> to treat an accord in preſence of a Prercur of the Aetolians, the ſaid Pretour comming to ſome words with <hi>Philip;</hi> was reproved by him for avarice and infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, ſaying, that the Ae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

We know with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that this manner of proceeding by Leagues hath bin alwayes alike, and hath prodec'd the ſame effects. We ſee alſo, that that way of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king people become ſubjects hath bin alwaies weak, and brought forth but ſmall advantages; and when they have exceeded the due mean, they have gone to ruine, And if this courſe of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

Subjects, be unprofitable in warlike Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths, ſurely in thoſe that are diſorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, it muſt needs be far worſe, as in our daies have bin the Republiques of Italy. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we find that to be the true way, which the Romans held, which is the rather to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired, in ſomuch as there was no other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample thereof before that of Rome, nor ſince hath bin any that hath imitated it. And touching the leagues, there are the Switzers onely &amp; the Swevian league that follows them. And, as in the concluſion of this matter ſhall be ſaid, ſo many orders obſerv'd by the Romans, as well concerning the affairs within the City, as thoſe without, in theſe our times are not onely not followed, but made no account of; ſome of them are deem'd untrue, ſome unpoſſble, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers nothing to purpoſe, or unprofitable: ſo that whiles we ſtand ſtill in this ignorance, we become a prey to any that invades our Countrey. And though it ſhould ſeem difficult to imitate the Romans, yet ought it not ſeem ſo, to follow the ſteps of the ancient Tuſcans, eſpecially to the Tuſcans now living: for though they were not able for the reaſons al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, to make themſelves an Empire like that of Rome, yet could they gain them that power in Italy, that their manner of procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding would permit them, which for a long time was with great glory of their rule, and wars, and with exceeding great commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their manners and religion. Which power and glory was firſt abated by the French, and afterwards quite put out by the Romans, and ſo put out, that of this power, which two thouſand years ſince was very great, at this preſent we have no memory left.

                     <p>TO thoſe Philoſophers, who would have made men beleeve that the world is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, I think one might have replyed, that if ſuch antiquity were true, it would be conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, that we ſhould have ſome notice of more then five thouſand years time paſt, being that it is not apparent, how the remembrances of times by ſeveral occaſions were aboliſh'd. Whereof part proceeds from men, and part from heaven. Thoſe that proceed from men, are the changes of ſects and tongues: for when a new ſect begins, that is, a new religion, the firſt endeavor, to gain it ſelf reputation, is, to blot out the memory of the old; and when it ſo falls out, that the founders of the new ſect are of a different language, they eaſily extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh it: which thing is known, by conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the waies, which the Chriſtian Religion uſed againſt the Sect of the Gentiles, whereby it hath cancel'd all their orders and ceremonies, and defac't the whole remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance <note place="margin">* This is all calumny; for we find not that any have preſerv'd the records of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning more than the Chriſtians, however much intermixt with Paganiſine. I take it that that theſe memorials were laſt in the vaſt deluges of the Vandals, Goths, and Hunns, who themſelves being barbarous and ignorant, envyed <hi>others learning; and therefore deſtroyd all the regiſters of antiquity they could find: which our Author injuriouſly imputes to the Chriſtians, being that they time out of minde, have caus'd thoſe books to be taught the youth in their ſchools and we find that the moſt eſteemd Fathers in the Church were adorn'd with that learning, which they are raxed to have perſecuted; which ſerves alſo very neceſſarily for the better underſtanding and illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating of</hi> Theology, <hi>and affords good arguments many times to our Divines for the conviction of the Gentiles out of their own writers. Nor do I find there was any other reſtraint in thoſe ſtudies, than that men were advis'd to apply themſelves ſoberly thereunto, as not being ſtudies to dwell in, but tending rather to the ſervice of</hi> Theology.</note> of thatan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Theology.

It is true, that they attaind not thorowly to wipe out the knowledge of the prime men thereof, which was occaſioned by their maintaining of the Latin tongue, to which they were forc't, being they were to write this new Law in it: for if they could have writ it in a new tongue, conſidering the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſecutions they made againſt it, there would have bin no remembrance left of things paſt. And whoſoever reads what courſes St. <hi>Gregory</hi> took, and the other heads of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, ſhall ſee with what obſtinacy they perſecuted all the ancient memorials, burning all the Poets and Hiſtorians works, defacing their images, and deſtroying every other thing that gave any lightwww. of that antiquity; ſo that if to this p<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

And though yet there remain ſome remembrance thereof, we take it as ſome fabulous thing, whereunto no man gives credit, as it befalls the ſtory written by <hi>Diodorus Siculus,</hi> in which though he gives ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of a forty or fifty thouſand years, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs is it eſteemed (and ſo I think it too) a falſe tail. As for the cauſes that proceed from heaven, they are ſuch as extinguiſh the race of mankind, and reduce to a ſmall number the inhabitants of part of the world; and this comes to paſs, either by peſtilence or famine, or by a deluge of waters; but that of moſt importance is this laſt, becauſe it is more uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, and becauſe thoſe that eſcape, are all ſuch as live among the mountains and are ſimple and ignorant people, who having no knowledge of antiquity, cannot derive it to their poſterity: and if among them any knowing man chance to eſcape, to gain himſelf, reputation and a name, he conceals it, and alters it at his own pleaſure, ſo that there is left to his ſucceſſors only ſo much as he hath bin pleas'd to commit to writing, and no more. And that theſe in undations, peſtilences, and famines ſometimes come, I beleeve there is no doubt, as well becauſe all hiſtories are full of them, as for that we ſee this effect of defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the memory of things, as alſo becauie it accords well with reaſon that it is ſo: for na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as in ſimple bodies, when there is gatherd together enough ſuperfluous matter, moves

many times of it ſelf, and makes a purgation, which is the preſervation of that bodie; ſo it falls out in this mixt body of mankinde, that when all countries are ſtuffed with inhabitants, that they can neither live there, nor go other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, becauſe all places are already poſſeſſed and repleniſh'd, and when the ſubtilty and wickedneſs of man is grown to that fulneſs it can attain to, it holds with reaſon, that of force the world be purged by one of theſe three waies, that men being become few, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſuffer'd much, may live with more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience and grow better, whereupon it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſtrange, that, as it is aboveſaid, the Tuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can nation in old time was very potent, full of Religion and vertue, had their own man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and their native tongue, which the power the Romans quite aboliſh'd, ſo that, as it is ſaid, onely their name remains ſtill in the memory of poſterity.</p>

                        <p>How the Romans proceeded in making of war.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>HAving diſcours'd, how the Romans pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in enlarging their State, we will now treat of their proceedings in making of war, and in every one of their actions it will appear with how great judgement, they left aſide the common way that others went, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they might more eaſily attain the higheſt pitch of greatneſs. The intention of that man, that makes war, either by election or by am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, is to get, and keep what he hath got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and to proceed ſo there with, that he may enrich and not impoveriſh his own country. It
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:30490:126"/>
is neceſſary for him then, both in getting and holding, to take a care not to diminiſh, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to augment the publique profit of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. He that will do theſe things, muſt follow the way and courſe the Romans took, who at firſt made their wars great and ſhort; for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into the field with huge armies, all the wars they had with the Latines, Samnites and Tuſcans, they diſpatcht in a very ſhort time: and if notice were exactly taken of all thoſe wars they made from the beginning of Rome, til the ſiege of Veium, we ſhould find they were all ended, one in ſix dayes, another in ten, and a third in ſome twenty dayes ſpace: for their cuſtome was this; ſo ſoon as ever they had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd the war, they preſently went out with their armies and fought with their enemies, who being overmaſter'd (to ſave their Countrey from ſpoil) yeilded to their conditions, and the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans condemn'd them in loſs of ſome of their territories, and thoſe they turn'd to their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Profits, or beſtow'd them upon ſome Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony they ſent thither, which being ſeituate upon ſome Frontier of theirs, became Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians of their confines, to the advantage of the inhabitants of that Colony, who had thoſe fields in poſſeſſion, and with the profit of the generality of Rome, that held this guard with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out expence. Nor could there be any way more aſſured, nor of more ſtrength or advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage: for til the enemy went into the field, this guard was ſufficient. And when they went forth ſtrong into the field to oppreſs that Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, the Romans alſo went out with their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and join'd battel with them, wherein having got the day, they laid more heavy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens on them, and ſo return'd home. Thus
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:30490:127"/>
came they by little and little to great credit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, and forces in themſelves. And this courſe held they alwaies, till they chang'd their manner of proceeding in war: which was after the ſiege of Vejum, where to ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them to make a long war they determined to pay the ſoldiers, whereas formerly, being that the wars were ſhort, there was no need to give them pay. And though the Romans gave pay, and that by vertue hereof they were able to make longer wars, and to make thoſe more remote, they were forc'd to ſtay longer in the field, yet did they never alter from their firſt order, to diſpatch them quickly, according to the time and place. Nor did they ever leave ſending of Colonies: for beſides their natural guiſe, the Conſuls ambition held them to their firſt cuſtome of making their wars ſhort; for being created but for a years time, and thereof to ſtay at home ſix moneths, they deſired to finiſh the war, that they might triumph. To ſend Colonies, the profit and great advantage they made thereof, ſtill prevail'd with them. They altered indeed ſomwhat touching the ſpoiles, whereof they were not ſo liberal, as in former times they had bin; becauſe they thought there was not ſo great need, the ſoldiers receiving their ſtipends; as alſo becauſe the ſpoiles being greater, they intended therewith ſo to fill the common treaſure, that they might not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd upon any enterpriſe in hand to leavy monies upon the City. Which order in a very ſhort time much enrich'd their treaſury. Theſe two courſes then they took, about the dividing the ſpoiles, and ſending of Colonies, caus'd Rome to grow rich by the war, whereas other Princes and Republiques, if they find that
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:30490:127"/>
means to releeve themſelves, become impove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhd; ſo that it came to this at laſt, that a Conſul thought he might not triumph unleſs he brought much gold and ſilver and ſpoils of every kind into the treaſury: Thus the Romans by their above written waies, ſometimes by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a quick end of the wars, otherwhiles by drawing them out at length with diſcomfitures and invaſions and treaties to their advantage, grew alwaies more mighty.</p>

                     <p>BY what parcels the Romans did divide the land among them, I beleeve it is hard to find out the truth, becauſe I think they beſtow'd on them more or leſs, according to the places, whether they ſent the Colonies; and it is credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, howſoever the caſe went, and whether ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they were ſent, the allowance was but ſmall.

                        <p>The occaſion, wherefore people leave their own native ſoyles, and invade other countreys.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>Seeing that we have formerly diſcours'd of the manner of proceeding in war which the Romans us'd, and how the Tuſcans were aſſail'd by the French, me thinks it were not much from the matter, to ſhew, that there are two ſorts of war made. The one is through the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Princes, or Commonwealths, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor the inlargement of their dominions; ſuch as were the wars of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, and the Romans, and ſuch as now adayes every Prince and Potentate makes one with another. Which wars are dangerous indeed, but yet they do not wholly chaſe the inhabitants out of a countrey; for the Conqueror is contented onely with the obedience of nations, and moſt commonly ſuffers them to live under their own Laws, and enjoy their own goods in their own houſes. The other kind of war is, when the whole people with all their families, riſe from a place, forced either by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine or war, and goe to ſeek a new habitation and new Countrey, not out of ambition to command, as the others, but to poſſeſs it by themſelves, and to drive thence or deſtroy the ancient inhabitants thereof. This kind of war is very cruel and terrible: And touching theſe
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:30490:128"/>
wars, <hi>Saluſt</hi> ſpeaks in the end of the <hi>Jugurthin,</hi> where he ſayes, that when <hi>Jugurth</hi> was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, the French were perceived to ſtir, who then came into Italy: and there he relates, that the people of Rome fought with all other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for rule and command, but with the French every one fought for his life and ſafety: For it ſufficeth a Prince or Commonwealth that aſſails a Countrey, to deſtroy onely thoſe that command, whereas theſe populations muſt make a general deſtruction, being that they will live upon that, which formerly ſuſtained others. The Romans had three ſeveral wars of theſe, exceeding dangerous. The firſt was that when Rome was taken, which was ſeis'd on by thoſe Frenchmen, that (as is above ſaid) had taken Lombardy from the Tuſcans, and ſeated themſelves there; whereof <hi>Titus Livius</hi> alledges two reaſons; The firſt, as we ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is, that they were allur'd by the pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the fruits and the wines of Italy, whereof they had ſcarcity in France: the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, that the people in France being excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly multiplyed, the Countrey could not ſeed them, whereupon the Princes of thoſe places thought it fit, that part of them ſhould goe to ſeek ſome new habitation, and that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution being taken, they choſe for Captains of them that were to depart, <hi>Belloveſſus,</hi> and <hi>Sicoveſſus,</hi> two French Kings, whereof <hi>Bello<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſſus</hi> came into Italy, and <hi>Sicoveſſus</hi> went into Spain. Upon the paſſage of which <hi>Bello<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſſus</hi> follow'd the ſeiſure of Lombardy, and thereupon the war, which firſt the French made againſt Rome. Next this was that, they made after the firſt Carthaginian war, when between <hi>Piombin</hi> and <hi>Piſa</hi> they ſlew more then
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:30490:129"/>
hundred thouſand, French. The third was, when the Germans and Cimbrians came into Italy, who having overcome ſeveral Roman Armies, were ſubdu'd by <hi>Marius.</hi> The Romans then maſterd theſe three very perilous wars, nor was there need of leſs valor than theirs to overcome them: for we ſee, how that after the valor of the Romans faild, and their armies loſt their ancient vertue, that Empire was ruind by ſuch like people, as the Goths, Vandalls, and ſuch others, who poſſeſsd themſelves of the whole weſtern Empire. Such people come out of their own Countreys, as is above ſaid, compell'd thereto by neceſſity, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity proceeds either from famine, or from ſome war and oppreſſion inflicted on them in their own Countreys. So that they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraind to ſeek new habitations. And theſe either are in great multitudes, and then they break with violence into others countreys, deſtroy the Inhabitants, poſſeſs their goods, make a new Kingdome, and change the name of the country, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did, and thoſe people likewiſe that ſeiz'd upon the Romane Empire; for theſe new names, that are in Italy, and in the other Provinces, grew from nothing elſe, than that they were ſo named by their new Lords. As is Lombardy now, which was called Gallia Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalpina; France was called Gallia Tranſalpina, and now is named of the French; for ſo were thoſe people called, that made themſelves maſters of it. Sclavonia was called Illyrium; Hungary, Pannonia; England, Brittanny; and many other Countreys, that have changed their names, which it would be too long to recite. <hi>Moſes</hi> allſo called that part of Syria, which he made himſelf maſter of, Jury. And,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:30490:129"/>
becauſe I have formerly ſaid, that ſome people are driven out of their own habitations by war, whereupon they are forc'd to ſeek a new, where to ſeat themſelves, I will alleage an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to that purpoſe, of the Mauruſians, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientiy a people of Syria; Who having notice of the Hebrews comming, and thinking they could not reſiſt them, thought it better to leave their Countrey, than in ſtriving to ſave that, loſe themſelves; And ſo riſing thence with their families, they went into Affrique, where they ſate down, driving out the Inhabitants they found in thoſe places. And ſo they, who could not defend their own Countrey, could yet take that of others from them. And <hi>Procopius,</hi> who writes of the war, that <hi>Bellifarius</hi> made with the Vandals, that poſſeſſed themſelves of Affri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que, reports that he read Letters written in certain pillars, in thoſe parts where theſe Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſians did inhabite, thus ſaying, <note place="margin">Nos Mauruſij, qui fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gimus a facie Ieſu la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronis filij Navae.</note> 
                        <hi>We are Mauruſians who fled from the face of Jeſu the robber, who was Son of Nave.</hi> Where the occaſion of the departure of theſe people out of Syria plainly appears; wherefore theſe people are very ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, when they are driven out by extream neceſſity, and unleſs they be encountred by pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſant forces, cannot be ſtopd: but when thoſe that are conſtraind to abandon their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey are not very numerous, there is no ſuch danger of them, as of thoſe people we ſpoke, becauſe they cannot uſe ſuch violence, but ought rather by ſome ſtratagem, make themſelves maſters of ſome ſtrong place, and therein be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſetled, keep it by making of friends and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies; as we ſee <hi>Aeneas</hi> did with <hi>Dido,</hi> the <hi>Maſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi> and others, who all by agreement with
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:30490:130"/>
their neighbors, where they once ſet themſelves down, were able to continue. The people that goe forth in the greateſt multitudes, and thoſe alſo that have gone forth, almoſt all came out from thoſe parts of Scythia, cold, and poore Countries, where, becauſe there are men in abundance, and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of that condition, that it cannot feed them all, they are compeld to goe forth, having many cauſes to drive them out, and nothing to keep them in. And if now for theſe five hundred years it hath not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, that any of theſe nations have made an inundation upon any Countrey, it hath proceeded from ſeveral reaſons. The firſt is, the great evacuation that Countrey made in the declining of the Empire, they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſince ſent out huge ſwarms more than thirty ſeveral times: the ſecond is, becauſe Germany, and England, from whence theſe people came, have their Countries well mended, ſo that they are able to live there, with better conveniency; and thereupon not neceſſitated to change their ſeat.

But the Campani being oppreſſed, having their recourſe to Rome, beyond the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes expectation and the Samnites, the Campani giving themſelves into the Romans hands, they were conſtraind to deſend them, as their ſubjects, and take upon them that warre, which they thought with their honour they could not avod: For it ſeemd very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to the Romans, not to undertake the defence of the Campani, though their friends, againſt the Samnites their friends; but they thought it alſo a ſhame not to deſſend them, when they were their ſubjects; or recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to their protection, judging that when they had not taken that defence in hand, they cut off the way from all others that ever ſhould have a mind to ſhelter themſelves under their power. And Rome having for her maine end the Empire and glory, and not qui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="232" facs="tcp:30490:131"/>
ſelfe ſame occaſion gave beginning to the firſt warre againſt the Carthaginians, for the defence of the Maſſineſes, which the Romans under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke in Sicily; which fell out by chance alſo. But now the ſecond warre, that grew between them, came not by chance. For <hi>Hannibal</hi> the Carthaginian Captaines, ſet upon the Saguntins that were allyes to the Romans in Spaine, not ſo much for to endammage them, as to provoke the Romanes to warres, and to have occaſion to fight with them, and ſo to paſſe into Italie. This manner of kinoling new warres hath been alwayes uſd among thoſe that are mighty and that have ſome ſaith joynd, ſome other reſpects: for if I deſire to make warre with a Prince, and between us ſome capitulations of peace have firmly been obſerved a long time, upon ſome other title fair juſtifiable, and under ſome other colour, I will aſſayle ſome ally of his, rather than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, knowing very well, that in ſetting upon his alley, eyther he will reſent it, and ſo I ſhall have my intent of moving warre againſt him; or not reſenting it, his weakneſſe ſhall be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverd, or his infidelitie, in not defending one that is under his protection; and the one and the other of theſe two is ſufficient to diſcredit him, and facilitate my deſignes. Therefore what wee have formerly ſayd, may be noted touching the taking occaſions to move warre, out of this example of the yeelding of the Campani; and beſides what remedie a Citie may have, which cannot by her ſelfe alone make her defence, and yet in any caſe would not fall into her aſſaylants hands. Which is freely to give her ſelfe into his hands, who thou haſt a purpoſe ſhould defend thee, as the

Capuans to the Romanes, and the Florentines to <hi>Robert</hi> King of Naples, who though he would not defend them as allyes, yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards defended them being his ſubjects, againſt the forces of <hi>Caſtruvius</hi> of Lucca, who then put them hard to it.</p>

that affirmes Moneys to be the ſinews of warre, which ſentence was firſt given by Q. <hi>Curtius,</hi> in the warre betweene <hi>Antipater</hi> the Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donian, and the King of Sparta; Where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, that for want of moneys, the King of Spar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But his treaſure fayling, and he doubting his Armie would leave him for want thereof, was conſtraind to hazard the battell; whereupon Q <hi>Curtius</hi> ſayes, that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys are the firews of war; which ſentence is alledgd every day, and followd too by ſome Princes, not quite ſo wiſe as they ſhould be: for making this their ground, they beleeve, that this is able to defend them, if they have treaſure enough; and never conſider, that if treaſure were of force to overcome, that <hi>Darius</hi> would have conquerd <hi>Alexander,</hi> the Greekes maſterd the Romanes, and in our dayes the Duke <hi>Charles</hi> ſubdu'd the Swiſſers, and not long time ſince the Pope and the Florentins together would have found no difficultie in overcomming <hi>Francis Maria</hi> nephew of Pope <hi>Julius</hi> the ſecond in the warre of Orbin. But all theſe above nam'd, were overcome by thoſe who eſteemd not mony, but good Souldiers the ſinews of warre. Among other things, that <hi>Croeſus</hi> King of Lydia ſhewd to <hi>Solon</hi> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenian, was a treaſure unmeaſurable, and asking him what he thought of his power, <hi>Solon</hi> anſwerrd him, he thought him no whit the more powerfull for that; for warre was made with iron and not with gold, and ſome one might come, who had more iron than be,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:30490:132"/>
and take his gold from him. Moreover, when after the death of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, a vaſt multitude of French paſſ'd over into Greece, and after into Aſia, the French ſending Ambaſſadours to the King of Macedon to treate ſome accord, that King to ſhew them his power, and to fright them, let them ſee his treaſure, where was much gold and ſilver, whereupon theſe French, who had in a manner concluded a firme peace, brake t; their deſire grew ſo great then to take his gold from him: and ſo was <hi>that</hi> King deſpoyld for that which he had gatherd together to defend him. The Venetians alſo, a few yeares ſince, having their treaſury full of coyne, loſt their whole State, being not able to defend themſelves thereby. Wherefore I ſay, that gold as the common opinion cryes it up, is not the ſinewes of warre, but a good Armie of ſlour Souldiers; for gold is not ſufficient to finde good Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, but good Souldiers are able well to finde our gold. As for the Romanes (if they would have waged warre by moneyes rather tha with the ſword) the treaſure of the world, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering their vaſt undertakings, and the great difficulties they had therein, would not have ſervd their turnes. But they making their warres with the ſword, never found ſcarcitie of gold; for they had it in abundance brought even into their Camps by thoſe that ſtood in feare of them. And if that Spartan King for want of money, were to hazard the fortune of a battell, that befell him upon the matter of moneys, which many times hath chanc'd upon other occaſions: for it hath been often ſeene, that when an Armie wants proviſion of vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualls, and is neceſſitated either to ſamiſh or
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:30490:133"/>
ſight, uſually they make choyce to fight, becauſe it is greater honour, and where in ſome ſort Fortune hath in her power to ſavour thee. Moreover, it hath often come to paſſe, that a Commander perceiving ſuccours comming to his enemies Armie, muſt either fight with them quickly, and make tryall of the chance of battell, or expecting the i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

There are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore many neceſſities that can force a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine beyond what he intended, to reſolve to put it to a battell, among which ſometimes may happen the ſcarcitie of moneys, though not therefore ſhould wee eſteeme moneyes to be the ſinews of warre rather, than other things, which bring men into the like neceſſities. Wee may therefore reſolve the queſtion, that money is not the ſinews of warre, but good Souldiers rather. It is true, moneys are neceſſary in the ſecond place, but it is ſuch a neceſſitie, which good Souldiers themſelves may overcome: for it it as impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that good Souldiers ſhould lack money, as by moneys alone to produce good Souldiers. What we here averre, every Hiſtory ſhews us to be true in many places, notwithſtanding that <hi>Pericles</hi> perſwaded the Athenians to make warre with a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="237" facs="tcp:30490:133"/>
they might overcome that warre with induſtry and by force of money; and though in that warre the Athenians ſometimes proſpeed, yet at laſt they loſt it, and the advice, and good Souldiers of <hi>Sparta</hi> prevayld more, than the induſtry and money of Athens. But <hi>Titus Livius</hi> gives us a better teſtimony for this opinion then any one elſe, where diſcourſing of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> the Great, whether if he had come into Italie, he had been able to vanquiſh the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, he ſhews there three things neceſſary in the warre; a great number of Souldiers, &amp; thoſe good, wiſe Commanders, and good fortune: where examining, whether eyther the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes or <hi>Alexander</hi> excelld herein, at length he concludes, without making any mention of moneys. The Capuans, when they were requird by the Sidicins, to take Armes in their behalfe againſt the Samnites, ſhould not have meaſurd their power by their treaſure, but by their good Souldiers: for by taking that courſe they tooke to aſſiſt them, after two overthrowes, to ſave themſelves, they were forc'd to become tributaries to the Romanes.</p>

                     <p>I Have heard it diſputed ſometimes by men well practis'd in military diſcipline, if there be two Princes neare of equal force, and the one that is the more reſolute have proclaim'd warre againſt the other, which were the beſt courſe for that other, either to attend quietly in his owne confines whiles his enemy come upon him, or elſe to goe finde him at home, and there aſſaile him.

<pb n="240" facs="tcp:30490:135"/>
came to diſpute, <hi>Croeſus</hi> advis'd againſt the opinion of the reſt, to goe &amp; ſeeke her in her owne country; urging that otherwiſe if he overcame her farre from her owne confines, he could not take her kingdome from her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe would have time to repaire her loſſes; but if he conqur'd her within her owne territories, he might purſue her juſt upon her ſlight; &amp; ſo giving her no time of recovery, take the ſtate from her. Moreover they alledge the advice that <hi>Hanniball</hi> gave <hi>Antiochus,</hi> when that King had a purpoſe to make warie againſt the Romans, where he ſhewes how the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans could not be overcome but in Italy; for there another might availe himſelfe of their armes, their wealth, and their friends alſo. But whoſoever fought with them out of Italy, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Italy free to them, left them that ſtrength, that never would want life to give them freſh ſupplies at all occaſions. And concluded, that it was eaſier to take Rome from them, then the Empire; and Italy, rather than their other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces. <hi>Agathocles</hi> alſo is alleadg'd, who not being able to ſupport the war at home, aſſail'd the Carthaginians, who then had made warre againſt him, and brought them to aske peace. The example of <hi>Scipio</hi> is likewiſe urg'd, who to take the warre out of Italy, aſſail'd Affricke. They that maintaine the contrary, ſay, that he that would bring his enemy to deſtruction, ſhould withdraw him from home. The Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are brought for example, who while they made a convenient warre at their owne homes, remain'd victors: but when they departed out of their country, and tranſported their army in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="241" facs="tcp:30490:135"/>
ſhew'd, how that <hi>Anteus</hi> King of Lybia aſſail'd by Egyptian <hi>Hercules</hi> was inſuperable, whiles he ſtaid for him within the confines of his owne Kingdome, but when by <hi>Hercules</hi> ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty he was trained out of it, he loſt both ſtate and life. Whereby occaſion was given to the fable of <hi>Anteus,</hi> that while he was upon the ground, he recovered forces from his Mother, which was the ground, which <hi>Hercules</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, took him up in his armes, and held him from the earth. Moderne advices alſo are alledged; every one knowes that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of Naples was in his dayes held a very wiſe Prince; and ſome two years before his death fame flying, that <hi>Charles</hi> the eight then King of France had a determination to come and aſſail him, after he had made much prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration fell ſick, when on his death-bed, among other memorials he left his ſonne <hi>Alphonſus,</hi> was this alſo, that he ſhould attend his enemies comming within his Countrey, and upon no caſe ſhould dr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Which was not followed by him, but there was an army ſent into Romania, which without any combat, loſt both it ſelf and the ſtate. The arguments, which beſides the things aboveſaid, are brought on each ſide, are theſe; that he, that aſſailes, comes on with more courage, then he that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, which gives the army more confidence: Beſides this, it takes away from the enemy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers conveniencies of being able to make uſe of what is his own; for he cannot help himſelf upon thoſe ſubjects, whoſe houſes have firſt bin ſackt and their goods pillaged: and for having the enemy in the houſe; the Prince
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:30490:136"/>
is conſtrained to take more care how he wrings money from them, and vexes them: ſo that he comes to dry that fountain, as <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi> ſayes, which furniſhes, him with means to ſuſtain the war. To this may be added, that the ſouldiers being in a forrain countrey, are forced to fight, and of that neceſſity makes a vertue, as we have often ſaid; on the other ſide, they ſay, when one awaits his enemy, he does it with much advantage: for without any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodity to thy ſelf thou art able to give thine enemy much trouble to come by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, and other neceſſaries belonging to an army. Thou canſt alſo better hinder his deſigns, becauſe thou knoweſt the countrey better then he. Thou canſt alſo incounter him with more forces, becauſe there they may eaſily be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which thou canſt not draw all from home. Thou canſt alſo being routed, recover thy ſelf with more eaſe, becauſe many of thy army will ſave themſelves, in that they have their places of refuge near, as well becauſe the ſupplies are not to come from far; thou bringſt to the hazzard all thy forces, and not all thy fortune; whereas parting thence thou hazzardſt all thy fortune with but a part of thy forces. And ſome there have bin who the better to weaken their enemie, ſuffer him to enter many dayes journies into their countrey, and take divers townes, to the end that leaving gatriſons in all of them, he may weaken his army, and ſo they may afterwards fight with him at more ods. But to give my opinion herein what I think, I beleeve, this diſtinction is to be made; Either my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey is armed, as was that of the Romans, or that of the Switzers is, or it is diſarmed as that
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:30490:136"/>
of the Carthaginians was, or elſe that of the King of France, or the Italians countrey is. In this caſe the enemy is to be kept off from comming in, becauſe thy advantage than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in thy revenue, and not in thy men, ſo that whenſoever the current thereof is cut off from thee, thou art quite ſpoil'd; nor doth any thing ſo much hinder thee, as the war within thy doores. The Carthaginians yeeld us evident examples hereof, who, whiles they had their own home free, were able with their revenue to make war againſt the Romans, which, when it was aſſaild, could not ſupply them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Agathocles.</hi> The Florentines had not any remedy againſt <hi>Caſtruccius</hi> Lord of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But <hi>Caſtruccius</hi> being dead, the ſame Florentines had the courage to aſſail the Duke of <hi>Milan</hi> at his owne home, and wrought ſo far as to take his countrey from him; ſo much valor ſhew'd they in forrain wars, and ſuch cowardiſe in their domeſtick. But when countries are armed, as that of Rome was, and as the Switzers are, the nearer thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt to them, the harder they are to vanquiſh; for theſe bodies are able to bring together more forces to reſiſt a ſuddain violence, then they are to, aſſail an enemy abroad.

themſelves by the remainders of their armies, nor could they have had thoſe conveniencies to repair their loſſes, nor made head againſt their enemies with ſuch ſtrength as they did. We never find, that to afſail any countrey they ſent out an army paſſing the number of 50000. But to defend themſelves at home againſt the French after the firſt Punicke war, they armed eighteen hundred thouſand men. Nor could they afterwards defeat them in Lombardy, as they did in Tuſcany: becauſe againſt ſo great a maltitude of enemies, they had never been able to draw ſo great forces ſo far out, nor fight with them upon the like ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. The Cimbrians broke an army of the Romans in Germany, nor could the Romans any way help themſelves. But when they came into Italy, that they once united their forces together, they preſently diſpatched them. The Switzers it is eaſy to vanquiſh our of their own Countrey, whether they cannot ſend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove thirty or forty thouſand men: but to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome them at home, where they are able to make a body of a hundred thouſand men, is exceeding difficult. I conclude therefore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new, that that Prince, who hath his people armed and addreſt for war, may alwaies well expect a mighty and dangerous war at his own home, neither let him goe to meet it. But he, whoſe ſubjects are unarmed, and his countrey unaccuſtomed to war, let him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies keep it as far from home as he can. And ſo the one and the other, each in their degree, will better defend themſelves.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>I Take it to be very true, that ſeldome or never it comes to paſs, that men of meane fortunes attain to any high degrees without force or fraud: unleſs that dignity, which a man hath gotten, came to him by gift, or was caſt on him by inheritance Neither do I think, we ever find, that force alone ſuffices; but we often ſee, that guile alone avails, as he ſhall clearly perceive, that reads <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedons</hi> life, and that of <hi>Agathocles</hi> the Sicilian, and many others ſuch like, who from very vile and poore fortunes have gain'd either a Kingdome, or ſome other great dignities. <hi>Xenophon</hi> in <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> his life, declares this neceſſity of deceit, being that the firſt expedition which he makes <hi>Cyrus</hi> to undertake againſt the Armenian King, is full of guile, and how by deceit, and nor by force he makes him ſeize on his Kingdom; by which Action he concludes nothing elſe, but that it is neceſſary for a Prince, that will at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheive great matters, to learn to be a cunning deceiver. Beſides this he makes him deceive <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>axares</hi> King of the Medes his Mothers uncle many waies, without which fraud he ſhews <hi>Cyrus</hi> could never have attain'd to that great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he afterwards came. And I beleeve, <note place="margin">* Becauſe this whole Chapter tends to ſhew how neceſſary for a Princes advantage guile is, and it is again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended by precept in <hi>Machiavels</hi> Treaty of a Prince, I cannot but take notice that here he is blameable. <hi>Dolus an virtus quis in hoſte requir it,</hi> is not meant <hi>De dolo Malo:</hi> ſuppoſed <hi>by Machiavel</hi> in his Prince <hi>Chap.</hi> 19. where he perſwades a Prince <hi>to uſe the Lyons force, and the Foxes craft.</hi> To be able in all Military ſtratagems and ſlights to circumvent the enemy, is one of the moſt requiſite and not able parts in a Commander: pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided there be no breach of Faith, nor Oath vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated: for as <hi>Tully</hi> ſayes, <hi>Eſt jusjurandum affirmatio Religioſa: quod autem affirmate, quaſi Deo teſte promiſeris, id tenendum eſt. It is much unworthy of a Prince</hi> (ſayes a worthy late Author) <hi>to falſifie his word, either to enemy or ſubject that it be; and the more villanie is it to uſe covert fraud, than open violence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the enemy lies more open by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving credit to his faith: And fraus diſtringit, non diſſolvit perjurium.</hi> And with how much more ſolemnity Princes Oaths are ordinarily taken, mee thinks, ſo much the more ſincerity ought they to carry with them, having drawn together many eyes &amp; ears as witneſſes of their truth or falſhood. I ſhall conclude then with <hi>Tacitus,</hi> in the 4. of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. <hi>Caereris mortalibus in conſtant confilia quod ſibi conducere putant; principum diverſa ſors eſt, quibus praecipua rerum ad ſamam dirigenda.</hi>

And that, which Princes are neceſſitated to do in the beginnings of their increaſe, Republiques
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:30490:138"/>
are likewiſe forc'd to, till they are become mighty; then force alone ſuffices. And becauſe Rome in every part lit either by chance or by choyce upon all the neceſſary means to become great, it failed not alſo of this, nor in her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning could have dealt more cunningly, than to take the courſe we formerly diſcourſed of, to make her ſome companions; for under this name, ſhe brought many to be her ſervants, as were the Latins, and other people neare about her: for firſt ſhe ſerved her ſelf of their armes in ſubduing her neighbours round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and in taking upon her ſelf the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſtate; afterwards when ſhe had brought them under likewiſe, ſhe came to ſuch growth, that no power was able to withſtand her. And the Latins never perceived their own ſervitude, til after that they ſaw the Samnites twice broken, and forced to agreement. Which victory as it gained the Romans great reputation with forrain Princes, whereby they heard of the Romans name, though they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver felt their armes: ſo it bred great envie and ſuſpect in thoſe that both ſaw and felt their ſtrength, among which were the Latins: And ſo far prevailed this envie and fear, that not onely the Latins, but the Colonies which they had in <hi>Latium</hi> together with the Capuans by them lately defended, conſpired all againſt the name of the Romans. And the Latins mov'd that war in that manner, as is formerly ſaid, that for the moſt part wars are mov'd, not aſſailing the Romans, but defending the Sidicins againſt the Samnites, againſt whom the Samnites made war with the Romans leave. And that it is true, that the Latins ſtirred upon the knowledge of this deceit, <hi>T. Livius</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares

                     <p>IN this very ſame matter, and in the ſame beginnings of the War between the Latins and the Romans, we may obſerve, that in every conſultation it is good to come to the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of that which is to be deliberated on, and not to ſtay long in doubt, and upon the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of a thing.

I have the more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly noted this paſſage, by reaſon that many times I have known that ſuch doubt hath much wrong'd publick actions, even to the loſs and diſgrace of our Republike. And it ſhall ever come to paſs, that, in doubtfull caſes, and where there is need of judgement to deliberate, this reſolution ſhall be when they are to be adviſed, and deliberated on by weak man.

He makes it plain alſo in this caſe of the Latins; for the Lavinians being ſought to by them for ayd againſt the Romans, put off the reſolut on of it ſo long, that when they were juſt going forth of the town to give ſuccors to them, news came that the Latins were defeated.

Which ratification was delayd by ſome, who in their little wiſdome favour'd Duke <hi>Lodowicks</hi> affairs, til that the King was even upon the point of victory, when the Florentines offering the rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, it would not be accepted by the King, who knew the Florentines came by force, and not willingly to his friendſhip.

I ſay therefore, that out of <hi>Livius</hi> his words wee gather that the Romane Army had three prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal diviſions, which in proper termes may be calld Squadrons; the firſt was of the Haſtati, the ſecond of the Prencipi, the third of the Triarij: and each of theſe had their horſemen. In the ordering of a battell, they plac't the Haſtati for moſt, in the ſecond place on the right ſide, upon the ſhoulders of thoſe the Prencipi were ſet, and in the third place yet in the ſame file, the riarij came. The horſe of all theſe ranks they plac't on the right hand and on the left of theſe three battells: which Squadrons of horſe from their formes and Places were call'd wings: becauſe they lookt like the two wings of that body. They rangd the firſt Squadron of the Haſtati, which was in front, in a manner cloſe ſhut together, that it might be able either to force upon, or ſuſtain the enemy. The ſecond Squadron of the Prencipi (becauſe it was not the firſt to fight, but was ordeind to ſuccour the for moſt, in caſe it was either beaten or driven backe) this they made not ſo compact together, but kept their ranks thinne, ſo that they might receive in to them without diſordering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the firſt Squadron, whenſoever being preſt on by the enemy, they were forc't to retire. The third Squadron of the Triarij had
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:30490:143"/>
their ranks yet thinner than the ſecond; that, if need were, they might receive the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Squadrons of the Haſtati and Prencipi. The troupes then being all plac'd in this order, began the fight: and if the Haſtati were forc'd or overcome, they retir'd into the thinneſſe of the ranks of the Prencipi, and they united to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and having made of two battallions one body, undertooke the fight afreſh; and if theſe were beaten back and routed, they fell backe into the thinner rankes of the Triarij, and ſo all the battallions became one body, renewd the fight againe, where if they vanquiſhed, becauſe they had not other repayre, they loſt the day. And becauſe that alwayes when this laſt quadron of the Triarij came to try for it, the Army was in danger, thereupon grew his Proverb, <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matter came ſo farre as the Triarij.</hi> The <note place="margin">Res redacta eſt ad Triatios.</note> Commanders of our dayes, as they have abandoned all the other inſtructions, and follow nor in any part the ancient diſcipline, ſo have they quite neglected this part, which is of no ſmall importance: for he that ſo arrang<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s his Armie, that in the fight he can three times repair himſelf, to loſe he muſt have fortune three times his enemy, and be to incounter a valour ſufficient to vanquiſh him. But he that ſtands onely on the firſt ſhock (as now our Chriſtian Armies doe) may eaſily loſe: for every little diſorder, or meane valour, is able to take from him the victory. That which makes our Armyes not able to recover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves three times, is, becauſe they have loſt the manner of receiving one Squadron within another: Which comes to paſſe, becauſe now adayes battells are rangd which one of theſe
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:30490:143"/>
two diſorders; either they place their troupes at the ſhoulders the one of another, and make their battell large of breadth, and thinne in depth; which makes it weaker, becauſe there is but ſmall diſtance from the breſt to the backe. And when to make it ſtronger, they reduce the troupes to the Romane manner, if the firſt front be broken, not having order to be receivd in the ſecond, they fall together into a confuſion, and rout them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: for if that before be beaten backe, it falls upon the ſecond; if the ſecond ſtrives to advance, it is hindred by the firſt: Whereupon the firſt and the ſecond both beating upon the third, cauſes ſuch a confuſion, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly a very little matter deſtroys a whole Army. The Spaniſh and French Armyes in the battle at Ravenna, where the Lord <hi>de Pors</hi> Generall of the French forces dyed, which was (according to our times) a well fought battell, was arranged in one of theſe forenam'd wayes: which is, that one and the other Armie came on with all their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple plac'd to ſhoulder the one the other, ſo that neither army had but one front, and were much more in breadth then in depth. And this befalls them alwayes, where they have a large plaine, as they had at Ravenna. For knowing the diſorder they make in reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, by placing themſelves in one file, they avoide it when they can, which they do by making the front large, as it is ſaid. But when the ſcite of the country reſtraines them, they remaine in the forenam'd diſorder, without adviſing themſelves of the remedy. In which they paſſe through their enemies countries, they goe out to forrage, or venture on any
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:30490:144"/>
other exploit. And at Saint <hi>Regulus</hi> in that occaſion of <hi>Piſa,</hi> and otherwhere, where the Florentines were routed by the Piſans, during the warre which was betweene the Florentines and that city, for their rebellion, after <hi>Charles</hi> the King of France his paſſage in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Italy, thoſe defeates were cauſed by nothing elſe but by their owne horſe: which being in vantgard, and by the enemies beaten backe into the Florentine foote, routed it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon all the remainder turn'd their backes; and <hi>Criacus de Borgo,</hi> the ancient generall of the Florentine infantery, hath ſaid it many times in my hearing, that they had never bin routed but by their own horſe. The Swiſſes who are the principall maſters of our modern warres, when they ſerve with the French, above all things have a care to place themſelves on the ſide, for feare their owne horſe driven backe ſhould beate upon them. And howbeit theſe things ſeeme eaſie to underſtand, and very eaſie to practiſe, yet hath not there been any of our contemporary Commanders, that would follow theſe ancient orders, or amend the moderne. And though they have made their Armies tripartite, terming the one the Vauntguard, the other the Battell, and the laſt the Rereguard: they make no other uſe thereof, but to command them when they are quatered in their lodgings, but in any ſervice, very ſeldome it is (as is formerly ſaid) but that they make all theſe bodies run one fortune. And becauſe many to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe their own ignorance, alledge that the violence of the Artillery permits not that many of the ancient orders be obſervd, I will argue it in the next Chapter, and examine,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:30490:144"/>
whether the Artillery doe hinder the practiſe of the ancient valour.</p>

                        <p>What eſteeme our moderne armies ought to have of artilery, and if the opinion; which is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally conceived of it, be true.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>WHen I conſider, beſides the things formerly written, how many pitcht battells were fought by the Romans at ſeverall times, that general opinion which many hold, comes into my minde, that if a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>tilery had bin uſed in thoſe dayes, the Romans could never ſo eaſily have ſubdued the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes they did, nor have brought theſe nations they did, to become their tributaries, nor in any caſe could they have made ſuch brave conqueſts. They ſay moreover, that by reaſon of theſe guns, men cannot put in practice nor ſhew the valour they could of old. And then they adde a third matter, that it makes it more difficult to come to a battell now, then formerly; nor can they containe themſelves within the orders of thoſe times, ſo that in time the warre will be all reduced to the artillery. And being deſirous now not out of purpoſe to argue touching the the truth of ſuch opinions, and how much artillery hath augmented or diminiſhed the force of armies, and whether they bereave or affoard good Captaines occaſion to behave themſelves valourouſly, I will begin to ſpeake concerning, their firſt opinion; that the ancient Roman armies would never have made thoſe conqueſts they did, had artilery bin then in uſe. Whereupon I ſay in anſwer, that warre is made either in defence or offence. And then we are to examine, to
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:30490:145"/>
which of theſe two parts it does more good or hame. And though reaſons may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged on both ſides, yet I thinke, that without compariſon the defendant receives more dammage by it, then the aſſailant. The reaſon, which hereof I give, is, that the defendant is either within a walled towne, or in the field within trenches: If he be in a towne, either it is but little, as moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly for treſſes are, or great and large. In the firſt caſe, the defendant is quite loſt; for ſuch is the force of artillery, that no wall be it of what thickneſſe it will, but in a few dayes is ruined by it. And if thoſe that are within the walls, have not good roome to retire themſelves, with retrenchments and forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, they are loſt; nor can they ſupport the ſhocke of the enemy, when he would enter by breach in the wall, nor hath he any helpe herein of his artillery: for this is <hi>a max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime,</hi> that where met can enter in by throngs and with violence, the artillery cannot keep them off. Therefore the furious aſſaults of the Tramontaines it is not poſſible for the defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant to reſiſt; but the aſſaults the Italians give, are well enough endured, who never all in a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>hrong, but ſcatteringly come to the fight, which they by a name very fit for the purpoſe, call skirmiſhes. And theſe that goe with this diſorder and timcrouſneſſe to enter a breach, where artillery is, go to an apparent death, and againſt them artillery is a good uſe: but thoſe who in throngs, when the one preſſes forward the other, come to the breach, unleſſe ſuſtained by ditches and ramparts, will enter any place, and the artillery ſhall never beat them off; and though ſome few of them
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:30490:145"/>
be ſlaine, yet can they never be ſo many as can hinder them of victory. That this is true, we finde in many conqueſts which fortainers have here made in Italy, eſpecially in that of Breſcia: for that towne having rebelled againſt the French, and the fort holding good yet for the French King, the Venetians were to ſupport all the violence, that from thence could fall in upon the towne, having all that way guarded with artillery, that deſcended from the fortreſſe into the city, ſome of them being planted againſt the front, others upon the flankes, and ſo in every other place fir. Whereof the Lord of Fois made not any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, but deſcending a foote with his troopes paſſed through the midſt of them, and tooke the towne, nor ever appeared it that he had received thereby any notable loſſe. So that he who defends a little towne (as it is ſaid) which is walled in, but hath not ſpace to retire with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>etrenchments and fortifications, and truſts upon the artillery, is preſently loſt. And thou defendeſt a great towne, and haſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency for retreat, yet without compariſon is the artillery more availeable to thoſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, then within the walls. Firſt, becauſe thou wouldeſt with thy artillery annoy thoſe without, thou muſt of force raiſe thy ſelfe with it above the levell: for while thou art on the levell, every ſmall fence or trench that the enemy makes ſecures him, and thou canſt no wayes dammage him; ſo that thou being to raiſe thy ſelfe, and to mount thy peeces on the curtaine of the wall, or ſome other way, draweſt two difficulties upon thee. The firſt is, that thou canſt not bring ordnance thither, neither of that bigneſſe nor effect, that he
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:30490:146"/>
without can, being that great things are not manageable in ſmall ſpaces. The other is, that though we grant thou canſt bring ſuch peeces thither, yet canſt thou not make thoſe ſafe and ſtrong fortifications to ſecure thy arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery within which they without can, being upon the plaine ground, and having thoſe conveniences, and that roome, they can deſire. So that it is impoſſible for him that defends a towne to keepe his artillery mounted on thoſe high places, when thoſe without have ſtore of great and good peeces. And if he brings them into lower places, they become for the moſt part unprofitable, as it is ſaid. So that the defence of a city is to be made by the bodies of men, as it was the cuſtome of old, and with the ſmall ſhot: Whereby if they make any ſmall advantage, in regard of the ſmall ſhot, they ſuffer as much loſſe, which counterpoiſes all the good the artillery can do them: for by them the towne walls are all laid flat, and, as it were, buried in the ditches, ſo that when the enemy comes to enter by aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault, either becauſe the walls are beaten downe, or that the ditches are filled, he that is within, hath more diſadvantages thereby, then otherwiſe he had. And therefore (as it was formerly ſaid) theſe inſtruments of wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>re do more helpe the beſieger, then the beſieged. Touching the third point, which is to retire into the campe, and there to make intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to keepe off from battell till ſome convenience or advantage gotten, I ſay, that herein thou haſt no more helpe ordinarily to keepe thee from fighting, then had the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents. And ſometimes by reaſon of the artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery thou haſt more diſadvantage: for if the
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:30490:146"/>
enemy come upon thee, and have ſome ſmall advantage of the field, as it may eaſily chance that he gets the upper ground of thee, or that at his arrivall thou haſt not fully caſt up thy trenches, nor cover'd thy ſelfe well with them, preſently he diſlodges thee whithout remdy, and thou art forced to come cut of thy forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications and fight: which befell the Spaniards in the battell at Ravenna, who, being forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied betweene the river Roncus, and a trench they had caſt up, the fence whereof was not of that hight was needfull, ſo that the French had gotten ſome ſmall advantage of the ground, were forc'd by the artillery out of their fortifications to come to fight. But grant (as moſt commonly it ſhould be) that the place where thou haſt encamped, were higher then thoſe others whereof the enemies were maſters, and that their fortifications were good and ſecure in ſuch ſort as by meanes of ſcituation and other thy preparations the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy dares not aſſaile thee, in this caſe they will be forced to uſe thoſe meanes, which of old they were wont, when any one lay with his army, where he could not be endammag'd, which were to forrage the country and pillage it, to beleager ſome of the cheife townes, to hinder thy proviſions, ſo that by ſome neceſſity thou ſhalt of force diſlodge and be brought to fight, where the artillery, as we ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after ſhew is not of ſo great effect. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering then what ſort of warres the Romars made, being in all moſt all of them they were aſſailants, and not defendants, it ſhall appeare (being that theſe things above written are true.) that they would have had greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, and ſooner have made their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conqueſts,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:30490:147"/>
had the artillery bin in thoſe times. Touching the ſecond point, that men cannot make proofe of their valour as of old they might, by reaſon of the artillery, I ſay, that it is true, that where men are to ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in ſcattered troops, they run more ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, then when they are to ſcale a wall or make ſuch like aſſaults, where they are not all in one body, but each one a part ſhewes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. It is true alſo that the Captaines and Commanders of armies are expoſed to more danger of death, being that then the artillery can reach them in any place; nor availes it them to be in the hindermoſt rankes, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vironed by their valianteſt Souldiers. Yet we ſee, that neither of theſe two dangers do often endammage much; for places fortified are not eaſily ſcal'd, nor do they weakly goe to aſſaile them: but if they will take them, they muſt beſieges them, as it was the cuſtome of old. And where they take their townes by aſſault, the dangers now a dayes are not much greater then they were wont to be: for even in thoſe times they who defended the townes, wanted not their inſtruments of warre where with to ſhoote at their enemies, which (though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they were not of that violence) yet for ſlaughter were of the ſame effect. Touching the death of Captaines and Commanders, in foure and twenty yeares time, that theſe laſt warres have bin in Italy, we have not ſo many examples, as in ten yeares the ancients had: for from <hi>Count Lodowicke</hi> of Mirandola, that died at Ferrara, when the Venetians, a few yeares ſince, aſſai'd that ſtate, and the Duke of Nemours, that died at Cerignuola, there hath not any one bin ſlaine by the canon: For
<pb facs="tcp:30490:147"/>
                        <pb facs="tcp:30490:148"/>
                        <pb n="265" facs="tcp:30490:148"/>
the Lord of Fois was ſlain by the ſword at Ravenna, and not by the Cannon. So that if men give no particular proofs of their valour, it is not cauſed by their canon, but prooeeds from their evil orders, and the feebleneſs of their armies, which when they want valour in the groſs, cannot then in any particular make ſhew of it. Touching the third allegation made by them, that they can never come to joyne battel, but that the ſum of all will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the artillery, I ſay that this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is utterly falſe, and ſo ſhall it be held by thoſe who according to the valour of old will imploy their armies: for whoſoever will have a good army, muſt uſe them in trainings or rather in battels to come up cloſe to the enemy, and there fall to handy blows with him, and take him by the coller: and they ought to ground more upon the infantry then the cavallery, for ſome reaſons we ſhall here, after alledge. And when they ſhall rely moſt upon the foot, and upon theſe waies we have ſpoken of, the artillery becomes quite unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable; for more eaſily can the infantry avoyd the blow of the cannon by comming up cloſe to the enemy, then of old they could eſcape the ſury of the Elephants, the chariors arm'd with hooks, and ſuch other unaccuſiomed encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which the Roman infantry met with, and ſound remedy againſt, which they would to much the more eaſily have found againſt theſe, as much as the time is of very ſhort durance in which the artillery can harme thee, in compariſon of of that wherein the Elephan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>id miſcheif: for theſe in the very middle and heat of the battle did put all into diſorder; whereas the artillery hinders thee
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:30490:149"/>
onely before the battel: which hinderance the infantry eaſily avoid, either by going co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd under the naturall ſcite of the place, or by ſtooping towards the ground when they ſhoot: which alſo we ſee by experience is not neceſſary, eſpecially to eſcape the canon, which can hardly be ſo right levell'd, but that if they go high they miſs thee, if low they come ſhort of thee. Afterwards when the armies are come to handy blowes, this is more clear then the light, that neither the great nor ſmall ſhot can do thee much harm: for if the enemy places the artillery before him, thou mayſt eaſily take it; if behind him, it hurts himſelf before it can touch thee: or if it be on either ſide of thee, it cannot ſo gall thee, but that thou mayeſt come up cloſe to it; whereupon will follow the effect we have ſaid. Nor needs there much diſpute upon this: for we have ſeen it by the example of the Switzers, who at Navarra in the year 1513. without arrillery or horſe aſſail'd the French army within their fortifications being guarded with artillery, and yet routed them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no way hinder'd thereby: and the reaſon is, (beſides the things formerly alledged) becauſe the artillery hath need to be guarded, if we would it ſhould make any good execution, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by ſome wall, or trenches or ſome kind of fortifications, and when it fails of theſe defences it becomes a prey to the enemy, &amp; ſo is made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, as it comes to paſs when it is defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded onely by men, or as it may be in field bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels, it cannot be plac'd on the flank, unleſs it be on that manner, that the ancients used their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of war, when they plac'd them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their ſquadrers, becauſe they ſhould play from without the ranks; and whenſoever they
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:30490:149"/>
were put at, either by the horſe or others they retired behind the legions: whoſe ever accounts otherwiſe of them, does not well underſtand the uſe of them, and truſts'upon that, which may eaſily deceive him, and if the Turk by the help of his artillery, have gaind any victory of the Sophy and the So'dan, it was not occaſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on'd by other vertue of it, then by the affright the unuſual noiſe thereof put the horſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. Therefore I conclude, comming to the end of this diſcourſe, that the artillery is proſſitable in an army, where there is a mingle of the anci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ent valour, without which it avails little againſt a couragious army.</p>

                        <hi>had rather indeed they ſhould be delivered bound into my hands.</hi> Which opinion however that it was utterd by a very able man, yet if we are to follow authorities, we may rather give credit to a Roman Commonwealth, and ſo many excellent Captains, that flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in it, than to one <hi>Hanniball</hi> alone, though without this authority the reaſons are evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent: for a man on foot can go in many places, where a horſeback he cannot: he may be able to inſtruct them, how to keep their ranks, and being ſomewhat confus'd, how they may be reſtored again. It is very hard to make the horſe keep their ranks, and when once they are in diſorder, it is impoſſible to recover them. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, as we ſee it among men, ſo is it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong horſes; ſome there are which have but ſmall courage, others again exceeding coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious. And many times it falls out, that a brave horſe is back'd by a cowardly fellow, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a timerous jade is mounted by a ſtout Souldier; and there which way ſoever it is that this diſparitie follows, ariſes uprofitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and diſorder. The infantry well united in their ranks are eaſily able to rout the horſe, and very hardly can they be routed by them: Which opinion is confirmed (beſides many an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient moderne examples) by their authorities who have left us the records of ancient Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, where they ſhew us, how that at firſt they began to make war a horſeback, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they underſtood neither the order nor the uſe of the foot, which when they once had
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:30490:150"/>
the knowledge of, they quickly conceiv'd how much more profitable they were than the horſe. But hereupon it follows not that the horſe are not neceſſary in armies, to diſcover, and to forrage and prey about in the Countrey, and to purſue the enemies in their ſlight, and in part alſo to oppoſe all the attempts of the the adverſaries horſe. But the ground-worke, and the very nerves of the army, and whereof moſt account is to be made, is the Infantry. And among the Italian Princes faults, which have euthral'd Italy to ſtrangers, there is none greater than that they made no account of this order, and turn'd all their regard towards the ſervice of horſemen: Which diſorder procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the evil diſpoſition of the Captains, and their ignorance that govern'd the State: by reaſon that for theſe twenty-five years laſt paſt all the military affairs in Italy were in the hands of men that had no ſetled eſtates, but were Captains adventurers, ſerving where they could have pay, who preſently deviſed how they could maintain their reputation, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing in armes when the Princes were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed. And becauſe they could not continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally get pay for a good number of foot, nor had any ſubjects whereof to ſerve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and a ſmall number got them no credit, they be took themſelves to horſe: for a Captain having pay for 200 or 300 horſe, ſubſiſted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by in good repute, and the payment was not ſuch, but that thoſe that rul'd the State could eaſily ſatisfie it. And to the end this ſhould come on more eaſily, and to keep themſelves the better in eſteem, they took all reſpect and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation from the foot, and reſerred all to their cavallery; And ſo far increas'd they this diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:30490:151"/>
that in the greateſt Armie they levyed, the leaſt part of them was foot. Which cuſtom, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with many other diſorders intermixt with it, hath much weakned the Italian Soldie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſo that this Country hath eaſily bin trodden under foot by all ſtrangers. This error, of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeming the horſe more than the foot, is laid open yet more plainly, by another example of the Romans. The Romans were incamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Sora; and a troop of horſe having made a ſally out of the town to aſſualt the Camp, a Captain of the Roman horſe went to incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them with his Cavalry, whereupon the firſt ſhock, meeting breſt to breſt, it chanc'd that the Commander of each troop was ſlain, and the reſidue being left without government, and the skirmiſh ſtill continuing, the Romans that they might the better vanquiſh their enemies, light from their horſes, and forc't their enemies (if they would defend themſelves) to do the like, wherewith the Romans carried away the victory. This example could not ſerve better to the purpoſe, in ſhewing of how much value the infantry is, above the horſe: for if in other occaſions the Conſuls made the horſemen to diſmount, it was to ſuccour the foot that were in diſtreſs, and had need of ayd. But in this place they light not to aſſiſt the foot, nor to fight with their enemies foot, but fighting a horſeback with horſemen, they thought that though they were not able to maſter them on horſeback, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning they could more eaſily vanquiſh them: I will therefore conclude, that a body of foot in good order and array cannot without much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty be overcome by another body of foot. <hi>Craſſus</hi> and <hi>Marchus Antonius</hi> both Romans, made an introde of many daies journeys into the Parthians Kingdome, with a very few horſe
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:30490:151"/>
and a good number of foot, where they incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred with numberleſs troops of the Parthian horſe. <hi>Craſſus</hi> was left there dead with part of the Army; <hi>Marcus Antonius</hi> valorouſly ſav'd himſelf. Nevertheleſs, in theſe Roman loſſes it appears, how much the Infantry exceeded the horſe: for being in an open Country, where there are few mountains, and very few rivers, and the Sea-coaſt far off, and remote from all conveniency, yet for all this did <hi>Marcus Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> even in the opinion of the Parthians them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, very valourouſly eſcape, nor ever durſt the whole Parthian Cavalry venture to break into the ranks of his Army. If <hi>Craſſus</hi> periſh'd there, whoſoever well reads his actions, ſhall find, that he was rather treacherouſly beguild, than forc'd, nor ever in all his diſorders, durſt the Parthians ſet upon him, but alwaies went along by him, to keep in his ſoldiers from ſtrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and getting of proviſions, and by promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing fairly, but obſerving nothing, brought him at length unto extream diſtreſs. I ſhould think I were to take much pains in perſwading that the valour of the infantry does much excel that of the horſe, but that there are many modern examples which give us a very ſatisfactory teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. And tis well known that 9000 Swiſſes at Navarra, formerly alleaged by us, went to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter 10000 horſe and as many more foot, &amp; vanquiſh'd them: for the horſe could no way harm them, and the foot being for the moſt part Gaſcoignes and ill ordered, they made ſmall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of. We ſee likewiſe that afterwards 36000 Swiſſes, went to find <hi>Francis</hi> the French King about Milan, who had an army of 20000 horſe and 40000 foot, and a 100 tire of Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; and though they gaind not the battel at
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:30490:152"/>
at Navarra, yet they fought bravely two dayes together, and when at length they were broken the moity of them eſcap'd. <hi>Marcus Regulus Attilius</hi> preſum'd with his infantry to incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not onely the enemies horſe, but their Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants; and though his purpoſe came not to effect, yet was it not ſo, but that the valour of his infantry was ſuch, that he had very good reaſon to hope he might well overcome that difficulty. And therefore I anſwer, that he that would overcome a body of foot in good array, muſt oppoſe them with another body of foot in better order than they; otherwiſe he ſuſtains an evident loſs. In the dayes dayes of <hi>Philip Viſconti</hi> Duke of Milan, there came down into Lombardy ſome 16000 Swiſſes, whereupon the Duke <hi>Carmignuola</hi> being then his Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, ſent him with neare upon a thouſand horſe and ſome few foot to incounter them: Who not knowing the manner of their fighting, went to meet them with his horſe, not doubting but that he could preſently rout them. But find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to ſtand firm, and having loſt many Souldiers, retir'd; yet being a very able man, and knowing in new accidents how to try new wayes, having repaird his broken troupes, he went again to meet them, where he made all his armed men a light, and ſerve on foot, and ſo by them having made a head to thoſe of his infantry, he inveſted the Swiſſes, who found no way to help themſelves: for <hi>Carmignuolaes</hi> horſemen bring lighted, who were wel arm'd, were able with facilitie to enter into the Swiſſes ranks without much hurt: which when they had pierc'd, they could eaſily harme; ſo that of their whole number there was left onely that part alive, that was by <hi>Carmignuolaes</hi> curteſie
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:30490:152"/>
preſerv'd. I beleeve well that many know this difference of valour that is between the one and the other of theſe orders, but ſo unhappy are theſe times, that neither the ancient nor modern examples, nor the acknowledgement of the error is of force to prevail with modern Princes to readviſe themſelves and conſider, that to recover the reputation of the Souldiery of a Countrey or State, it is neceſſary to revive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain theſe orders and entertain them near their perſons, to encourage them and allow them means to live, to the end they may reſtore to them both life and reputation. But as we uſe to forſake theſe cuſtoms, ſo we leave other or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders alſo formerly ſpoken of; whereupon it comes to paſs, that the very conqueſts we make turne to our loſſes, and not to the advancement of a State, as hereafter we ſhall ſay.</p>

Some thirty years agoe, an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talian would never have bin perſwaded, that ten thouſand foot in a plain had ever bin able to aſſault ten thouſand horſe and ſo many more foot, and not only fight with them, but van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh them too, as it is plain by the example of the battel at Navarra; by us ſundry times al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leag'd.
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:30490:153"/>
And however that Stories are full of them, yet would they not have given us credit: and if they had beleeved us, they would have ſaid, that in theſe dayes men are better arm'd, and that a ſquadron of men at armes would have bin of force to have ſhock'd with a rock, and not only with a body of foot, and thus with theſe falſe excuſes they corrupted their judgments. Nor would they have taken into conſideration, that <hi>Lucullus</hi> with a few foot routed a 150000 horſe that <hi>Tigranes</hi> led, and yet among thoſe horſemen there was a ſort of them very like our men at armes. And ſo this fallacy was diſcover'd by the example of forrain Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And as thereby it proves true, touching the infantry, which is related in Story, ſo ought it be beleev'd that all the reſt of the ancient or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders are true and uſefull. And when this we re once credited, Republiques and Princes would fail leſs, and be of more ſtrength to reſiſt any force ſhould come upon them, nor hope ſo much in the flight; and thoſe that ſhould have in their hands the government of State, would be better able to guide it, either by way of ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication or by way of preſervation, and would think that to increaſe the number of their Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, and make them as their aſſociates and not vaſſals, to ſend forth Colonies to keep the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries gained, to make a general ſtock out of the booties taken, to tame the enemy with incurſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp; by ſet battels, &amp; not long ſieges, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the publique ſtate in wealth, &amp; the private in ſcarcity, and to be induſtrious in keeping the armies in good diſcipline, are the means to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large a Commonwealth &amp; gain an Empire. And when this way of amplification ſhould not like them, then ſhould they think that all addition to
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:30490:153"/>
their ſtate are the ruine of Commonwealths, and therefore ſhould reſtrain all ambition, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating their City according to their lawes and cuſtoms, forbidding all inlargments, only ayming at defenee of what they have, and keeping them under good government, as the Republicks of <hi>Germany</hi> do, and ſo have liv'd free a good while. Notwithſtanding (as otherwhere I have ſaid, when I diſcours'd touching the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence there was in the ordering of a State to become fit to conquer; and the ordering of one to be able to maintain it ſelf) it is impoſſible, that a Republick ſhould have the hap to ſtand quiet, and enjoy her own liberty, with her ſmall Territories: for though ſhe moleſt not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers yet ſhe ſhall be moleſted her ſelf: ſhe may alſo have ſome mind or ſome neceſſity in ſome part to extend her bounds: and in caſe ſhe have no enemy abroad, yet may ſhe find ſome one at home, as it muſt needs be alwaies that ſuch be found among a great many potent citizens, and if thoſe Republicks of <hi>Germany</hi> can ſubſiſt in that manner, &amp; have been able to continue for a time it ariſes from ſome conditions, that are in that Country, &amp; which are no where elſe ſound, nor could they maintain ſuch a manner of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without them. This part of <hi>Germany,</hi> whereof I ſpeak, was ſubject to the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, as were <hi>France</hi> &amp; <hi>Spain;</hi> but when the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire began to decline, &amp; the title of the Empire was brought into that Country, the moſt potent of thoſe Cities began (according to the baſeneſs or the neceſſity of thoſe Emperors) to ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at liberty, buying themſelves out from the Empire, and reſerving thereunto only a a certain annual rent. Inſomuch as by little and little, all thoſe Cities, which he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

immediatly of the Emperor, and were no way in ſubjection to any Prince, in ſuch like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſet themſelves free. It happened in the ſame times, when theſe Cities bought out their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, that certain communalties of the Duke of <hi>Auſtria's</hi> ſubjects, rebell'd agianſt him, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong which were <hi>Tilibourg,</hi> the <hi>Swiſſes</hi> and others, who proſpering in the beginning, by little and little came to ſuch growth, that they not only ſhook off the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> yoke, but even became a terror to all their neighbours, and theſe are thoſe they call <hi>Swiſſes.</hi> This Country therefore is divided into the <hi>Swiſſes,</hi> Republcks, which they call-free Townes, Princes, and the Emperor. And the reaſon why among ſuch va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of governments there ariſe no warres, or if any do, why they continue not, is that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence they yeeld to the Emperor, who albeit he hath no great forces, yet is held in ſuch eſteem among them, that he alwaies reconciles them, &amp; with his authority interpoſing himſelf as Mediator, takes away all diſcontents: &amp; the greateſt &amp; longeſt warrs that have been there, were thoſe that follow'd between the <hi>Swiſſes</hi> &amp; the Duke of <hi>Auſtria;</hi> and though now for theſe many years the Emperor and the Duke of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria</hi> have been one and the ſame thing, yet was he never ſo powerful as to tame the <hi>Swiſſes</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence, where there was never any means of accord, unleſs it were by force; nor hath the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidue of <hi>Germany</hi> ever given him much aſſiſtance: partly becauſe thoſe communalties cannot find in their hearts to hurt thoſe that deſire to live under a civil government, as they themſelves do and partly becauſe thoſe Princes are not able, being poor, or will not, by reaſon that they envy too great puiſſance. Thoſe commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties therfore may live contented with
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:30490:154"/>
their ſmall dominions, becauſe they have no occaſion (in regard of the Imperial Authority) to wiſh it greater. They may live the better in union within their owne walls, becauſe they have the enemy near at hand, who would willingly take any opportunity to lay hold on them, whenſoever they ſhould fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to diſcord: but if that country were otherwiſe conditioned, it were fit for them to ſeeke the inlargement of their State, &amp; ſo interrupt their owne reſt: and becauſe otherwhere there are not the like termes, this manner of living can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be followed, and there is a neceſſity either to ſtrengthen the State by way of leagues, or to amplifie it as the Romans did. And whoſoever undertake any other courſe of government, ſeeke not their owne life, but ruine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſttruction: for many wayes, and for many reaſons are conqueſts hurtfull: for it is very poſſible to gaine dominion, and not ſtrength; and he that does increaſe his dominions, &amp; yet growes not in ſtrength, muſt needs go to wrack. They cannot grow ſtrong, that grow poore in the wars, although they prove vict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orious, becauſe their conqueſts coſt them more then they get by them, as the Venetians &amp; the Florentins did, who have bin much weaker, when the one commanded all Lombardy, and the other Tuſcany, then when the one was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with the ſeaonley and the other with ſix miles round of territories: for al this preceeded from their deſire to conquer, &amp; their ignorance to take the right courſe: and they deſerve the more blame, in that they have very little excuſe having ſeene the ways the Romanes went, becauſe they might have followed their exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, being that the Romanes without any pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:30490:155"/>
to follow, by their own judgment, found out a fit way to go. Moreover ſometimes ſuch gains gotten do no ſmal harm to a well govern'd Commonwealth, when either ſuch a city or country is conquer'd that abounds with pleaſures, where by converſation with them, their manners are learned, as it happen'd to <hi>Rome</hi> at firſt in the conqueſt of <hi>Capua,</hi> &amp; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to <hi>Hannibal.</hi> And had <hi>Capua</hi> been of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſtance from the City, that the ſoldiers er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror had not had the remedy near hand, or that <hi>Rome</hi> had been in ſome part corrupted, without queſtion that conqueſt had prov'd the <hi>Roman</hi> Republicks ruine. And <hi>T. Livius</hi> witneſſes the ſame in theſe words: <hi>Even then was</hi> Capua <hi>little good for the military diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,</hi>

                     <p>IF in another work of mine I had not trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at large of mercenary and auxiliary ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers how unprofitable they are, and how very profitable the native ſoldiers of the Country are, I would much more have inlarged my ſelf in this diſcourſe, than now I purpoſe; but having otherwhere diſcours'd hereupon at length, I ſhall now only point at it. Not yet did I think fit wholly to paſs it over, having found in <hi>Titus Livius</hi> ſo large an example be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to thoſe ſoldiers: for auxiliary ſoldiers are thoſe that a Prince or Commonwealth ſends with their Captains and pay ready fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd in thy aid. And comming to the text of <hi>T. Livius,</hi> I ſay, that the <hi>Romans</hi> having in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall places broken two armies of the <hi>Samnites</hi> with their forces, which they ſent to ſuccor the <hi>Capuans,</hi> and thereby freed them from that warr the <hi>Samnites</hi> made againſt them, purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to return to <hi>Rome,</hi> to the end the <hi>Capuans</hi> diſpoyl'd of ayd ſhould not a new becom a prey to the <hi>Samnites,</hi> left behind them in the country about <hi>Capua</hi> two legions to defend them. Which legions growing corrupt through idleneſs,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:30490:156"/>
began to be inſnar'd with the delicacies thereof So that having for gotten their owne country, and the reverence they ought to the Senate, they reſolved to take armes, and make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Lords of that Country, which they by their valours had defended, thinking thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants not worthy to injoy thoſe goods, which they knew not how to defend. Which thing, the Romanes having had ſome inkling of it before, was ſtopped, and puniſhed by them, as, where we ſpeak of conſpiracies, it ſhall be ſhow'd at large. Therefore I ſay again, that of all kindes of ſouldiers the auxiliaries are the moſt dangerous; Becauſe among thoſe, that Prince or Republique that uſes them for ayd, hath no authority, but onely he that ſends them: for auxiliary ſouldiers are thoſe that are ſent th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Theſe kinds of ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, when they have vanquiſhed, moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly pillage as well them that have hir'd them, as the enemy againſt whom they have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them; and this they do, either through the maligne diſpoſition of their Prince that ſends them, or through their owne ambition And however the Romanes had no intention to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olate the agreement and conventions made with the Capuans, yet the facility wherewith thoſe ſouldiers thought themſelves able to take their towne, was ſuch that it might have been of force to perſwade them to think of taking the town and State from the Capuans: Many examples to this purpoſe may be alledg'd; but this, and that of the inhabitants of <hi>Rhegium</hi> ſhall ſuffice me, from whom both lives &amp; town

were taken by one legion of ſoldiers, which the <hi>Romans</hi> had there left in garriſon. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Prince or a Republick ſhould rather take any other courſe, than ſeek to bring auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liary ſoldiers into his Country, principally when he is moſt to rely upon them: for any accord or agreement (though very hard) to which he ſhall yeeld with his enemy, ſhall be more tolerable than this. And if things paſt were well call'd to mind, and thoſe that are preſent well conſider'd on, for one that hath had good ſucceſs in ſuch a buſineſs, a man ſhall find exceeding many who have been abus'd. And a Prince, or an ambitious Republick can never have a fitter opportunity to ſeiſe on a Town or Country, than when they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd to ſend their armies for defence thereof. Wherefore he that is ſo ambitious, that not only for his own defence, but for offence to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, calls in ſuch like aids, ſeeks to gain that he cannot hold, and which alſo he that gets it for him, can at his pleaſure take from him, But ſo great is mans ambition, that if he can ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill his deſire for the preſent, he is never aware of that evill, which ſhortly after may thence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to him. Nor do the ancient examples avail any thing with him, as well in this, as in other things we have treated of: for were men hereby mov'd, they would perceive that the more freely and fairly they dealt with their neighbours, and the farther of they were from making themſelves maſters of them, the more readily would they offer to caſt themſelves into their armes, as hereafter ſhall appear by exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the <hi>Capuans.</hi>

Whereof the example is very clear; for the firſt place that ever they ſent any Preror to was <hi>Capua,</hi> whether they ſent him not through their own ambition, but upon the <hi>Capuans</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty, who (being they were at diſcord one with another) judg'd it neceſſary to have a Citizen of <hi>Rome</hi> amongſt them, that might put them in order again and reunite them. The <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiates</hi> alſo mov'd by their example, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd by the ſame neceſſity requir'd to have a Prefect ſent them. And <hi>T. Livius</hi> ſaies upon this occaſion, and upon this new way of ruling; <hi>That now not only the</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <note place="margin">Quod jam non ſolum arma, ſed jura Romana pollebant.</note> 
                        <hi>armes, but their lawes
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:30490:157"/>
alſo were in great repute.</hi> We ſee therefore how much this courſe taken, further'd the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> advancement: for thoſe Cities eſpecially that are accuſtomed to live free, or to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd by their own Citizens, are well enough contented to live in another manner of quiet under a rule they ſee not (though it may bring ſome burden with it too) rather than under that which they having every day in their view, continually reproaches them with their ſlavery. Beſides this; the Prince gains hereby another advantage, that his Officers having not in their hands theſe judicatures and magiſtracies, whereby they were to regulate thoſe Cities, there can no imputation or aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion be caſt upon the Prince. And hereby many occaſions of calumny and hatred againſt him are taken away. And that this is true, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides ancient examples, which we could al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, we have one of late memory in <hi>Italy:</hi> for as it is well known <hi>(Geneva</hi> having been ſeveral times poſſeſſed by the French) that King did alwaies (except at this preſent time) ſend them a French Governor, who under him ſhould govern them. For this preſent only, but upon any intention of the Kings; but it ſeem'd neceſſity ſo order'd it, he hath ſuffered them to be governed by their own lawes, and to have a Genowes for their Magiſtrate. And I make no queſtion but that he that inquires which of theſe two waies moſt ſecures the King for his rule over them, &amp; gives the people moſt ſatisfaction, would the rather alow of this latter. Moreover men caſt themſelves the more freely into thy armes, the further off they think thee from being deſirous to rule; &amp; ſo much the leſs do they fear thee in regard of their liberty, by
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:30490:158"/>
how much the more curteous and familiar thou art with them. This familiarity and free man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of behaviour made the <hi>Capuans</hi> haſty to aske a Prerour of the <hi>Romans:</hi> but had the <hi>Romans</hi> of themſelves made but the leaſt ſhew they would have ſent one thicher, they would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently have been in jealouſie of them, and ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from them. But what need we go to <hi>Capua</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> for examples, having ſtore enough at <hi>Florence</hi> and in <hi>Tuſcany?</hi> It is well known how long ſince it is that <hi>Piſtotia</hi> willingly yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it ſelf to the government of <hi>Florence.</hi> It is as well known alſo, what enmity hath been between the <hi>Florentines</hi> and the <hi>Piſans,</hi> the <hi>Luckeſes</hi> and the <hi>Seneſes;</hi> and this difference of dipoſition proceeds not from thence, that the <hi>Piſtoyeſes</hi> value not their liberty, as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do, but becauſe the <hi>Florentines</hi> us'd theſe with that reſpect they do their own brothers, but the others they treated as enemies. This was the occaſion made the <hi>Piſtoyeſes</hi> offer themſelves freely to be govern'd by them; and the others ſtruggle with all might and main, as yet they do alſo, not to come under them. And doubtleſs, had the <hi>Florentines</hi> either by way of alliances or ſuccours grown familiar with their neighbours, and not have alwaies ſcar'd them, they had at this inſtant been Lords of all <hi>Tuſcany.</hi> But hereupon I adviſe not, that armes and force are not to be us'd, but that they are to be reſerv'd for the laſt place, where and when other meanes will not ſerve.</p>

                        <p>How erroneous many times the opinions of men are, when they give their judgements touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great affaires.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>HOw falſe oftentimes mens opinions are, they well ſee, who are eye-witneſſes of their deliberations, which many times unleſs they be determined of by able men, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all truth. And becauſe that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent men in corrupted Commonwealths (eſpecially in peaceable times) both for envy and occaſions of ambition are maligned, ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is follow'd, as by reaſon of a common er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror is well approv'd of, or ſuch as is put for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward by men that aime rather at grace and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour then the general good. This error after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is diſcover'd in times of adverſity, and of force recourſe is had to thoſe that in times of peace were utterly forgotten, as in its own place in this part it ſhall fully be ſpoken of. There are alſo certain accedents where men are very eaſily beguiled, if not well experienced in affaires, the preſent accident having in it ſelf many likelihoods fit to make that credible, whereof in ſuch a caſe men are perſwaded. Theſe words are ſpoken upon that which <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micius</hi> the Pretour (after that the Latins were defeated by the <hi>Romans)</hi> perſwaded them; and upon that which few years ſince, many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved, when <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt, King of <hi>France</hi> came to the Conqueſt of <hi>Milan,</hi> which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by the <hi>Swiſſers.</hi> Therefore I ſay, that <hi>Lewis</hi> the Twelfth being dead, and <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Angouleſme</hi> ſucceeding in the Kingdome of
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:30490:160"/>
                        <hi>France,</hi> and deſiring to reſtore the Duchy of <hi>Milan</hi> to the Kingdome whereof the <hi>Switzers</hi> had of late poſſeſſed themſelves, by means of Pope <hi>Julius</hi> the ſeconds encouragement, deſired to have ſome aid in <hi>Italy,</hi> which might further his undertakings, ſo that beſides the <hi>Venetians,</hi> whom King <hi>Lewis</hi> had gain'd, he tried the <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines,</hi> and Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth, thinking his enterpriſe much facilitated, by having them to ſide with him, becauſe the King of <hi>Spains</hi> ſoldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were in <hi>Lombardy,</hi> and ſome of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors forces in <hi>Verona.</hi> Pope <hi>Leo</hi> yeelded not to the Kings deſire, but by thoſe that counſelled him, he was perſwaded (as it was ſaid) to ſtand neuter, ſhowing him that herein conſiſted certain victory: for it was nothing at all for the Churches good, to have either mighty in <hi>Italy,</hi> the King or the <hi>Swiſſers.</hi> But if he deſired to reſtore it to the ancient liberty, it was fit to free it from the one and the other. And becauſe it was not poſſible to varquiſh the one or the other, divided or united, it was not ami's to let them overcome one another, and that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Church with her allies ſhould aſſaile the conqueror, and it was impoſſible to find a better occaſion then the preſent, both being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped: and ſo the Pope having his forces in order, whereby he might be able to preſent himſelf upon the confines of <hi>Lombardy,</hi> near the two armies under colour of guarding his own ſtate, ſhould there abide till they had fought their battell: which in all probability (each army being very valorous) could not but prove bloody to them both and leave the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror ſo feeble, that the Pope might eaſily aſſaile and break him, and thereby he ſhould attain to become Lord of <hi>Lombardy,</hi> and
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:30490:160"/>
only arbitrator of all <hi>Italy.</hi> And how errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous this opinion was, appear'd by the event of the matter: for the <hi>Swiſſers</hi> being vanquiſh'd after a long fight, the Popes and the Spaniſh ſoldiers were ſo far from aſſailing the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors, that they prepared themſelves with what haſte they could for flight; which alſo would have little avail'd them had it not been for the Kings humanity or coldneſs in their purſuit, who ſought not after a ſecond victory, but was contented to make agreement with the Church. This opinion hath ſome arguments for it, which carry a colour of truth, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed are far from it: for it ſeldome comes to paſs, that the Conqueror loſes many of his ſoldiers; for of them, there are ſome only ſlai in the battel, and not in the flight: and during the heat of the combat, whiles men ſtand face to face one with another, few of them fall, eſpecially becauſe for the moſt part this continues but a ſmall while. And in caſe it ſhould laſt long, and many of the Conquerors ſhould fall; yet ſuch is the reputation, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror alſo, that victory draws with it, that it far exceeds the dammage, that by the death of thoſe ſoldiers can be ſuffer'd. So that an Army, which upon the opinion, that ſuch a one were weakned, going to aſſaile it, would be much deceived, unleſs it were ſuch an Army that at all times, before and after the victory, were able to deale with it. In this caſe the aſſailing Army may be able according to the fortune and valor it hath to win or loſe: but that which had formerly fought, &amp; vanquiſh'd, would have ſome advantage of the other: Which appears plainly by the experience the Latins gave us, and the fallacy by
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:30490:161"/>
which <hi>Numicius</hi> the Pretour was abus'd, as alſo by the dammage which thoſe people brought upon themſelves by beleeving him, who (when the <hi>Romans</hi> had vanquiſh'd the Latins) cried out through all <hi>Latium,</hi> that then was it time to aſſaile the <hi>Romans,</hi> who were weakned with the late fight they had with the <hi>Latines;</hi> that the <hi>Romans</hi> had carried away only the name of the victory, but had ſuffered all other ſorts of dammages, even as much as if they had been overcome, and that any ſmall force, if now a freſh it ſhould aſſaile them, were enough to diſpatch them. Whereupon thoſe people that gave credit to him, levied a new army, and were preſently defeated, and ſo ſuffered that loſs, which others ſhall that hold the like o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion.</p>

<pb n="289" facs="tcp:30490:161"/>
mind to make war, either they muſt caſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as a prey into the hands of thoſe that ayd them, or become a prey to their enemy. And into theſe miſchances men fall by evil advices and evil courſes, by not having well weighed their own forces, as before it was ſaid: for that Republique or Prince, that ſhould well weigh them, very hardly would ever be brought to thoſe termes the Latines came, who when they ſhould not have made accord with the Romans, made it, and when, they ſhould not have broke peace with them brake it. Whereby they brought it ſo to paſs that their agreement and diſagreement with the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans did equally endammage them. The Latins then were overcome and much broken at firſt by <hi>Manlus Torquatus,</hi> and afterwards by <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millus;</hi> who having forc't them to yeeld and render themſelves to the Romans, and put Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons in all the I owns in Latium, and taken hoſtages of them all, when he came back to Rome, related to the Senate, that all Latium was in the people of Romes hands. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this judgement is remarkable, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves note, to the end it may be follow'd, when Princes have the like occaſions given them, I will produce the very words, that <hi>Livie</hi> put in <hi>Camillus</hi> his mouth, which did teſtifie both of the manner the Romans held in amplifying the State, and that in their judgements touching the State, they alwaies avoided the middle way, and turn'd to the extreams: for a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is nothing elſe, but to have ſuch a tye upon the ſubjects, that they either cannot, or will not hurt thee. This is done either by making thy ſelf fully ſure of them, in taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from them all means to hurt thee, or by
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:30490:162"/>
doing them ſo much good, that it is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable they will wiſh to change their ſtate: all which is there comprehended; firſt by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition <hi>Camillus</hi> made, and afterwards by the judgement the Senate gave thereupon.

                        <hi>therefore now may ye for ever procure your ſelves repoſe and ſecurity from thence, either by rigor and puniſhment, or by clemency and pardon; chuſe ye whether.

And therfore it is behoovefull, whiles their mindes are in ſuſpence between fear and hope, to prevent them either with ſpeedy puniſhment or benefit.</hi> To this purpoſe followed the Senates deliberation, which was according to the Conſuls words; for calling them Town by Town, before them, thoſe that were of any moment, they ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

much benefited, or quite ruined them, granting divers exemptions and priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to thoſe they would do good to, freely making them Citizens, and giving them ſecurity every way. They diſmantled the other ſtrong Towns, and ſent Colonies thither, and brought the people from thence into Rome, and ſo diſperſed them, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their arms nor counſel they could do any more harm: Nor ever did they make uſe of any neutral way, in things (as I have ſaid) of moment. Princes ſhould imitate this judgment given; and hereunto the Florentines ſhould have intended, when in the year 1502. <hi>Arezzo</hi> and the valley of <hi>Chiana</hi> rebelled; which had they done, they had ſecured their Government, and much amplified the City of Florence, and likewiſe might have given them thoſe fields they wanted for their ſuſtenance: But they made uſe rather of that middle way, which is the moſt pernicious, in giving judgment upon men, ſo that part of the Aretins they confined, part they condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and took from all of them their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, and ancient degrees in the City, and yet left the City whole and untouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: And if any Citizen in their Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations adviſed that <hi>Arezzo</hi> ſhould be diſmantelled, and razed, they who ſeemed to be of the wiſer ſort, ſaid it would be a diſgrace to the Florentines to raze it; becauſe it would be thought then that Florence wanted forces to hold them; which are ſome of thoſe Reaſons that ſeem to be, but are not true: For by the ſame reaſon a patricide were not to be put to death, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:30490:163"/>
vile or ſcandalous perſon, it being a ſhame for that Prince to ſhew that he is not able to bridle ſuch a man alone: and theſe kind of men having ſuch opinions, perceive not, how men in particular, and ſometimes a whole City to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether too, do wrong a State: ſo that for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers example, and his own ſafeguard, a Prince hath no other remedy, but uterly to raze it. And indeed the honor conſiſts in the knowledg and power to chaſtiſe, and not in being able to hold a City under ſtil with many dangers: for the Prince that puniſhes not him that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends, ſo that he cannot offend more, is eſteemd ignorant and unworthy. This ſentence which the Romans gave, is confirm'd by the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they gave upon the Privernates.

                     <p>PEradventure it may ſeem to the wiſe men of our times a matter not well adviſed on, that the <hi>Romans,</hi> when they would make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſure of the people of <hi>Latium,</hi> and of the City of <hi>Privernum,</hi> never thought upon the building of ſome Fortreſs which might ſerve for a bridle to hold them in obedience, eſpecially being it paſſes for a Proverb in <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> alledg'd by our States men, that <hi>Piſa</hi> and other ſuch like Cities ſhould be kept with Citradells. And truely had the <hi>Romans</hi> been like them, they would have provided for the
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:30490:164"/>
building of them: but becauſe they were of another kind of courage, and judgement, and had another manner of power, therefore they never built any. and whiles <hi>Rome</hi> liv'd free, and obſerv'd her own ordinances, &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, for the propagation of vertue, ſhe never built any one to keep under Cities or Provinces, though it may be, ſhe preſerv'd ſome of them ſhe found already built. Whereupon having ſeen the manner of the <hi>Romans</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings herein, and that of the Princes of our times, I think to take it into conſideration, whether it be good to build Fortreſſes, &amp; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they advantage or wrong him that builds them. We muſt conſider then, that Fortreſſes are built either for reſiſtance againſt the enemy, or for defence againſt any tumult of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. In the firſt caſe they are unneceſſary, in the ſecond hurtfull. And to give a reaſon, wherefore in the ſecond caſe they are hurtfull, I ſay, that that Prince or Republick that is afraid of his own ſubjects, and their rebellion, muſt needs have his fear ariſing from the hatred his own ſubjects bear him; and that hatred from his own evill carriages, which evill car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages proceed from thence, either that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves he is able to keep them under by force, or from the Princes ſmall diſcretion: and one of the cauſes that makes him think himſelf able to rule them by force, is the having built theſe Citradels, over them: for evill treatings, which are the cauſes of hatred, for the moſt part are deriv'd from thence, that that Prince or Republick hath Cittadels upon them; which (when this is true) are far more hurtful, than profitable: for firſt (as it is ſaid) they make thee bolder and more rough among thy ſubjects,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:30490:165"/>
being that thou haſt thy ſecurity within them: for all theſe forces and violences which are in uſe to bridle a people withall, are of no value, but theſe two; either that thou haſt alwaies a good Army ready to ſend into the field, as the Romans had, or that thou doeſt diſperſe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh, diſorder, and diſunite them ſo, that in no caſe they can make ſuch a body as can hurt thee: for be it that thou doeſt impoveriſh them, <hi>They that are deſpoil'd of their</hi>

And if ever they were unprofitable, they are now a dayes ſo, in regard of the Artillery, by reaſons of whoſe fury and violence, it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to defend ſmall fortreſſes, and where there is no place for retiring with new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchments, as formerly hath been ſhew'd. But I will diſpute this matter more plainly yet. Wilt thou O Prince with theſe Cittadels curb thy Citizens? or wilt thou whether Prince or Commonwealth that thou art, bridle a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thou haſt taken by war? I will addreſs my ſelf to the Prince, and tel him, that ſuch a Fortreſs to curb his Citizens cannot be more unprofitable, for the reaſons above alleadgd: becauſe it makes thee prompter, and leſs careful how thou doeſt oppreſs them, which
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:30490:165"/>
oppreſſion makes them deſperate in attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thy ruine, and ſo inrages them, that that Fortreſs, which is the cauſe thereof, can no way preſerve thee; ſo that a ſage and good Prince, to keep himſelf ſtill good, and that he may not give occaſion to, nor imbolden his children to become bad, will never build for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, to the end they relie not upon the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadels, but rather upon the hearts of men. And if Count <hi>Francis Storce</hi> that came to be Duke of <hi>Milan</hi> was reputed wiſe, and yet in <hi>Milan</hi> he built a Cittadel, I ſay, that herein he little ſhewd his wiſdome, as appeard by the effect, ſeeing that Fortreſs proved rather a diſadvantage and loſs, then any ſafeguard to his heirs: for thinking that by means there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they might paſs their time in ſecurity, and yet injure their Citizens and ſubjects, they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare not any kind of violence; whereupon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grown very odious, they loſt the ſtate, ſo ſoon as they were aſſail'd by their enemy. Nor could that fortreſs defend them, nor did it any way advantage them in the war, and in time of peace it had done them much harme; for if there had been no ſuch citradel, and they for want of diſcretion onely had ſharply handled ſome of their ſubjects, they might ſooner have diſcover'd the danger, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn themſelves from it, and ſo afterwards they would have bin able with more courage to have reſiſted the French fury, having their ſubjects to freind without any fortreſs, then having them become thine enemies with thy fortreſs, which gives thee no help at all. For either it is loſt by the treachery of him that guards it, or is forced by the aſſailant, or elſe by famine. And if thou wouldeſt that theſe
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:30490:166"/>
ſhould avail thee, and help the to recover a ſtate loſt, where only the fortreſs holds for thee, thou muſt have an army, wherewith thou maiſt aſſault him that chaſed the from thence. And whenſoever thou haſt this army, thou couldeſt not in any wiſe faile of recovering the State, howſoever there were no fortreſs at all; and that the more eaſily, by how much the Inhabitants would be more thy friends, then if thou hadſt ill-treated them through pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption upon thy fortreſs. And it hath been proved by experience, how that this Cittadell of <hi>Milan</hi> hath little availed either the forces or the French party in the adverſity of the one or other, but hath rather brought upon them many ruins and miſchiefes, having never advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, by means thereof, upon any fair way to keep that ſtate. <hi>Guido <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>baldo</hi> Duke of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbin,</hi> ſon to <hi>Frederick,</hi> who in his daies was eſteemed a great Captain, being driven out of his ſtate by <hi>Caeſar Borgia</hi> ſon to Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the ſixt, when afterwards upon a new grown occaſion he returned thither again, he cauſed all the fortreſſes to be demoliſhed that were in the Country, thinking they did more harme then good: for he having gained mens hearts to him, for their ſakes would not abide them; and in regard of enemies, he ſaw they were not able to defend him, it being needfull to have a good army in the field to preſerve them withall, ſo that he reſolved to raze them all. Pope <hi>Julius,</hi> having driven the <hi>Bentivogli</hi> out of <hi>Bolonia,</hi> built a Cittadell there, and cauſed a governor of his to ranſacke them ſhrewdly, inſomuch that the people rebelled, and he ſuddenly loſt the Cittadel, ſo that it ſerved him to little purpoſe, or rather wronged him as much, as carrying
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:30490:166"/>
himſelf otherwiſe it could have helped him. <hi>Nicolas</hi> of <hi>Caſtello</hi> father of the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>itelli,</hi> return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into his Country from whence he had been baniſhed, forthwith demoliſhed two ſeveral fortreſſes, which Pope <hi>Sextus</hi> the fourth had built there, deeming that not the fortreſs, but the peoples good wills were more likely to continue him in his State. But of all other examples, the freſheſt and of moſt remarke in every point, and that which is fitteſt to ſhew the incommodity of building them, and the fruit of razing them, is that of <hi>Genua</hi> which fell out in theſe latter times. It is well known how that <hi>Genua</hi> in the yeare 1507. rebelled againſt <hi>Lewis</hi> the Twelfth, King of <hi>France,</hi> who came in perſon, and with all his ſtrength to regain it: which being done, he cauſed an exceeding ſtrong Cittadel to be built there, ſurpaſſing in ſtrength all others that are now adaies known: for in regard of the ſcituation, and the other circumſtances be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing thereto, it was impregnable, being placed upon the very point of a hill, which ſtretched it ſelf out into the ſea, called by the <hi>Genueſes, Godefa.</hi> And hereby the whole port, and a great part of the Town of <hi>Genua</hi> was ſubject to its battery: It happend afterwards in the year of our Lord God 1512. when the French were driven out of <hi>Italy,</hi> for all the fortreſs, <hi>Genua</hi> rebelled and <hi>Octavian Fregoſo</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the State thereof, who by his induſtry in the terme of 16 moneths took it by famine, and as every one beleeved, ſo he was advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by many, to reſerve it for his refuge in any accident. But he, as he was exceeding wiſe, knowing that they were not fortreſſes, but mens good wills that preſerved Princes
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:30490:167"/>
in their ſtate, razed it to the ground, And ſo without laying the foundation of his dominion upon the fortreſs, but rather upon his own valour and judgement, he hath continually held it, and holds it yet. And whereas a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand foot were formerly of force to charge the ſtate of Genua, his adverſaries have ſince aſſailed it with ten thouſand, and have not been able to hurt him. By this therefore it appears, how the demoliſhing of the fortreſs hurt not <hi>Octavian</hi> at all, nor did the building of it advantage the King of France: for when he was able to come into Italy bringing an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my with him, he might recover Genua, though he had no fortreſs there; but when he could bring no army with him into Italy, neither could he keep the Genueſes in obedience, though he had a fortreſs there. It was therefore an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence to the King to build it, and a ſhame to loſe it, and to <hi>Octavian</hi> a glory to regain it. But let us come to thoſe Republiques that raiſe up fortreſſes, not in their native countries, but in thoſe they have conquered. And to ſhew this fallacy, if that example of France and Genua ſuffice not, this of Florence and Piſa may, where the Florentines had built a cittadel, to keep that town in ſubjection: And never ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed themſelves, that a City which had alwaies been a proſeſſed enemy to the Florentines, having lived free, which hath a recourſe to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty for a colour of Rebellion, it was neceſſary (being deſirous to keep her) to uſe that manner the Romans had, either to take her as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion into the ſtate, or to deface and ruine her: for of what value cittadels are, we ſaw in King <hi>Charles</hi> his comming into Italy, to whom they were yeelded, either through the treachery
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:30490:167"/>
or cowardiſe of their governors. Whereas if they had not been, the <hi>Florentines</hi> would never have grounded their ability of keeping <hi>Piſa</hi> ſtil upon them, nor would the King have been of power that way to have bereaved the <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi> of that City; and thoſe means, whereby untill that time it had been maintained, would peradventure have been of force to preſerve it. And without doubt they could not have made a worſe triall, then that of the fortreſſes. I conclude therefore, that for the ſafety of ones native Country, a ſtrong hold is but hurtfull; &amp; to keep under Towns that are conquered, cittadels availe little. And hereunto the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the <hi>Romans</hi> ſhall ſuffice me, who diſman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telled the Towns they intended to hold by force, &amp; never built up their walls; and if any one againſt this opinion ſhould alledge me the example of <hi>Tarentum</hi> in ancient times, and in theſe modern that of <hi>Breſcia,</hi> which places, by means of the cittadells, were recovered from the ſubjects rebellion: I anſwer, that at the years end <hi>Fabius Maximus</hi> was ſent with the whole Army to recover <hi>Tarentum,</hi> who would have been able to recover that, though thete had been no cittadell there. And though <hi>Fabius</hi> put thoſe means in practiſe, yet had they never been, he would have us'd ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which would have produced the ſame effect. And I know not what advantage a cittadell yeelds, that to regain thee the Town, requires a Conſular Army, and a <hi>Fabius Maximus</hi> for commander, before it can be done. And that the <hi>Romans</hi> in any caſe had recover'd it plainly, appears by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Capua,</hi> where there was no cittadell, but they got it by the ſoldiers valor. But to
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:30490:168"/>
that of <hi>Breſcia,</hi> I ſay, that ſeldome chances which befell in that rebellion, that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs which is poſſeſſed ſtill by thy forces (the Town being fallen into rebellion) ſhould have a great army to friend and near hand, as was that of the French: for the Lord <hi>De Fois</hi> the Kings General being with his army at <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonia,</hi> when he underſtood the loſs of <hi>Breſcia,</hi> by means of the Fortreſs indeed recover'd the Towne. Therefore that Fortreſs yet ſtood in need (to do any good) of ſuch a one as was the Lord of <hi>Fois,</hi> and a French army, that in three daies might relieve them; ſo that this example againſt thoſe on the contrary ſide is of ſmall weight: for many fortreſſes have been taken in the wars in our daies, and recover'd by the ſame fortune that the field hath been taken, and recovered again, not only in <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardy,</hi> but in <hi>Romania,</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> and in all parts of <hi>Italy.</hi> But touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the building of ſortreſſes for defence againſt forrain enemies, I ſay, they are not uſefull to thoſe people, nor Kingdoms, who have good armies on foot; they are rather unprofitable, becauſe that good armies without fortreſſes are of force to keep them: but fortreſſes without good armies cannot defend thee. And this we ſee by experience of thoſe who have been held excellent in matters of ſtate and government and other things, as we know the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Spartans</hi> were: for if the <hi>Romans</hi> built no fortreſſes, the <hi>Spartans</hi> did not only forbear from them, but ſuffered none of their Cities to be wall'd in neither, becauſe they would have no other guard but a mans own valor, to defend him. Whereupon when a <hi>Spartan</hi> was asked by an <hi>Athenian,</hi> whether the walls a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:30490:168"/>
                        <hi>Athens</hi> were not very faire, he anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, yes, if all the inhabitants of the Town were women. To that Prince then that hath good armies, when upon the mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time frontiers of his ſtate he hath a fortreſs, that for ſome few daies he is able to ſuſtain the enemy, till things are ſomewhat order'd, it would ſometimes be of ſmall avail, but of no neceſsity. But when a Prince hath no ſtrong army, fortreſſes either in the heart of his State, or at his frontiers, are hurtfull, or unprofitable: hurtfull, becauſe he eaſily loſes them, and being loſt they make war upon him; or put caſe they are ſo ſtrong, that the enemy cannot take them, they are left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind by the enemies army, and ſo they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of no ſervice. For good armies, if they meet not with very ſharp encounters, enter far into their enemies Countries, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> thout regard either of Town or fortreſs they leave behind them: As it was evident in the ancient Stories, and as we ſee <hi>Francis Maria</hi> did, who in theſe latter times without any regard of them, left ten of the enemies Cities behind him, to aſſayl that of <hi>Vrbin,</hi> That Prince then that can raiſe a good army, can do well enough, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any ſtrong holds: but he that cannot have an army ready, ſhould never build any: well may he fortifie the City of his abode, and keep it in good ſtrength, and the Citizens thereof well diſpoſed, whereby he may be able to ſupport the enemies violence, till either ſome accord, or ſome forrain aid come to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. All other deſignes are expenſive in time of peace, and unfruitfull in time of war. And whoſoever ſhall well weigh all this that I have ſaid, ſhall perceive that the <hi>Romans</hi>
                        <pb n="304" facs="tcp:30490:169"/>
as they were in all other their affairs very judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, ſo were they very well adviſed in this judgement they gave upon the Latins, and the Privernates, where taking no care at all for citadels, they aſſur'd themſelves of them by wiſer and better waies.</p>

                        </gap>ods one with another, came to agreement, and ſo comming to the combat, broke and vanquiſh'd them. We ſee therefore how much men deceive themſelves (as formerly we have treated) in the courſes they take, and that many times where they think to get, they loſe. The <hi>Veyentes</hi> beleev'd, that by getting upon the <hi>Romans</hi> that were at variance one with another, they ſhould overcome them, but it prov'd the occaſion of reconcilement
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:30490:169"/>
to the <hi>Romans,</hi> but of ruine to themſelves: for the cauſes of diſcord in Republicks, is moſt commonly idleneſs and peace; and the cauſe of union and concord is fear and war. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had the <hi>Veyentes</hi> been wiſe, the more at variance they had perceived <hi>Rome</hi> to have been, ſo much the more ſhould they have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born from war againſt them, and with devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Peace caſt about how to maſter them. The way is, to endeavour to be reputed a confident friend of that City, which is in diſcord: and whiles they come not to armes, to carry him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as an Umpire between both parties. And when they do come to armes, to afford ſome ſlow favours to the weaker party, as well to keep them ſtill at war, and conſume them, as to hinder them from doubting that with thy great forces thou meaneſt to ſuppreſs them, and become their Prince. And when this part is well plaid, it cannot fail ordinarily, but that it will directly have the ſucceſs thou lookeſt for. The City of <hi>Piſtoya</hi> (as in another diſcourſe and to another purpoſe I ſaid) came to the <hi>Florentines</hi> Republick, by no other trick than this: for it being divided in factions, the <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi> now favouring the one, and then the other without any imputation of blame from either, brought them to ſuch terms, that being tir'd with their tumultuous living, they came wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly to caſt themſelves into the <hi>Florentines</hi> armes. The City of <hi>Siena</hi> never changed her State upon the <hi>Florentines</hi> favour, but when their courteſies came but thin and ſmall: for when they were frequent and ſtrong, they uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them rather for the defence of the State in which they liv'd. I will adde to theſe aforeſaid
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:30490:170"/>
one other example. <hi>Philp Viſconti</hi> Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> ſeveral times made war againſt the <hi>Florentines,</hi> grounding much upon their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreements, and alwaies came off a loſer.

Therefore (as it was ſaid before) the <hi>Veyentes</hi> and the <hi>Etruſcans</hi> deceived them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by this conceit of theirs, and were at laſt in a ſet battell vanquiſh'd by the <hi>Romans.</hi> And thus will others find themſelves deceiv'd, whoever ſhall ſeek by the like courſe, and upon the ſame occaſion to ſubdu any nation or people.</p>

the hurt he does, inſomuch that they are all weapons thrown from thee, which returne againe upon thee, Whereof there followed a notable example a good while ſince in <hi>Aſia,</hi> where <hi>Gabades</hi> a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> having a long while lien incamped before <hi>Amida,</hi> and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined upon the tediouſneſs of the ſiege to depart, and therefore to that purpoſe riſing with his campe, thoſe of the Town being come all upon the walls, and grown inſolent upon their victory, forbore no kind of outrage, diſgracing, blaming and reproaching the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my with his baſeneſs and cowardiſe: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Gabades</hi> being incenſed, alter'd his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and return'd to the ſiege, where ſuch was their indignation at the contumely, that in a few daies they took and ſack'd the Town. In the ſame manner it befell the <hi>Veyentes,</hi> who were not content (as is ſaid) to make war a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> but they rayl'd on them in vile termes, going even to their very tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to reproach them, ſo that they incenſed them more with their words then blowes: and thoſe ſoldiers which were hardly drawn to fight, conſtrein'd the Conſul to begin to fight, ſo that the <hi>Veyentes</hi> ſuffer'd, as the others we ſpoke of before, for their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence. Wherefore every good Commander of armies, and good Governor of Commonwealths is to practice all poſſible remedies, that theſe injuries or reproaches be not us'd either in the city or the army, neither one among ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor againſt the enemy: for being practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed againſt the enemy, there ariſe from thence the aforeſaid inconvenients: and among themſelves they would do worſe, when
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:30490:171"/>
there is no reparation made, which wiſe and judicious men have alwaies awarded. When the <hi>Roman</hi> legions left at <hi>Capua</hi> conſpired a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Capuans,</hi> as in its place ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, and a ſedition was there occaſioned by this conſpiracy, (which was afterwards quieted by <hi>Valerius Corvinus)</hi> among other conſtitutions which were made in the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they ordained very grievous puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for thoſe that ſhould ever reproach any of thoſe ſoldiers with that ſedition. <hi>Tiberius Gracchus,</hi> who during the warrs with <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi> was made a Captain over ſome certain number of ſlaves, whom the <hi>Romans</hi> for want of men had put into armes, ordained ſpecially a capital puniſhment for any that ſhould object to any of them their ſervitude: ſo hurtful a matter (as it is ſaid) was it thought by the <hi>Romans</hi> to ſet men at nought, and reproach them with any diſgrace; for there is nothing ſo much incenſes men to rage or breeds more hatred in them, whether it be ſpoken in earneſt or in jeaſt. <hi>Bitter taunts when they have too</hi>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Prudent Princes and Commonwealths ought to be contented with the victory: for oftentimes when that ſuffices them not, they loſe it.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THE uſing of diſgracefull words againſt the enemy, proceeds moſt commonly from an inſolencie, which either the victory or a falſe hope of victory incites thee to: which falſe hope cauſes men to erre not only in their ſayings, but in their doings alſo: for this hope when it enters into mens breaſts, makes them go beyond the point, and many times loſe the opportunity of having a certain good, hoping to attain unto a better uncertain good: and becauſe this is a matter worthy conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, men often deceiving themſelves, to the dammage of their State, I am of advice to ſhew it particularly by ancient examples and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern, being it cannot ſo diſtinctly be prov'd by reaſons. <hi>Hannibal,</hi> after he had defeated the <hi>Romans</hi> at <hi>Canna,</hi> ſent his Agents to <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi> to give them notice of the victory, and to demand new ſupplies. It was argued in the Senate, what was fit to be done. <hi>Hanno</hi> an old man and a diſcreet Citizen of <hi>Carthage</hi> adviſed, to uſe this victory wiſely, and make peace with the <hi>Romans,</hi> being that now they might have it upon reaſonable termes, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving gained a battell; and that they ſhould not go about to ſeek for it after a battell loſt: for it ſhould be the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> deſign to ſhew the <hi>Romans,</hi> that they were able to deal with them, and having gotten a victory, they
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:30490:172"/>
ſhould take a care not to loſe it for hope of a greater. This courſe was not taken, but afterwards the Senate of <hi>Carthage</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that this was very good counſell, when the occaſion was loſt. When <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great had conquer'd all the Levant, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth of <hi>Tyre,</hi> famous in thoſe daies, and puiſſant, by reaſon that their City was ſeated in the water, as <hi>Venice</hi> is, ſeeing <hi>Alexanders</hi> greatneſs, ſent Ambaſſadors to him to tell him, that they would become his faithfull ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vans, and yeeld him what obedience he ſhould deſire, but that they would not admit either him or his ſoldiers into their Town. Whereat <hi>Alexander</hi> diſdaining, that any one City ſhould ſhut her gates againſt him, ſeeing he had forc'd all others open throughout the whole world, would not accept their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but rejected them, and forthwith ſent his army thither. That Town ſtood in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and was well provided with victualls, and other munition fit for defence, ſo that <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> after four moneths ſpent, conſidering that one City took away all that time from his glory, which many other great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts never did, and therefore determined to try an agreement, and to grant what they of themſelves had asked. But they of <hi>Tyre</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grown inſolent hereupon, not only refuſed the conditions, but ſlew thoſe that came to treat with them. Whereupon <hi>Alexander</hi> all enraged at this affront, ſo ſtronly aſſaulted the Town, that he took it, deſtroy'd it, and ſlew or made ſlaves all the men therein. A Spaniſh Army came upon the <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi> Territories, to reſtore the <hi>Medici</hi> into <hi>Florence,</hi> and to lay ſome taxes upon the
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:30490:172"/>
Town, being hired hereunto by ſome Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens inhabiting therein, who put them in hopes that as ſoon as they ſhould ſet foot in their Country, they would take armes in favour of them; they comming into the plain, and none of theſe diſcovering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be for them, becauſe they had want of victualls, tryed to make an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereupon the <hi>Florentines</hi> grown proud, would not accept of any, upon which occaſion followed the loſs of <hi>Prato,</hi> and the ruine of that State. Therefore Princes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not commit a greater error when they are aſſail'd (in caſe the aſſailants are far more puiſſant then they) then to refuſe all termes of agreement, eſpecially when they are proffer'd them: for never will ſuch poor ones be offerd, wherein is not in a good meaſure compriſed his good that accepts them, and ſome part of his victory. Wherefore the <hi>Tyrians</hi> ſhould have ſatisfied themſelves, that <hi>Alexander</hi> accepted thoſe conditions he had formerly refuſed: and their victory had been great enough, when with their armes in hand, they had made ſo mighty a Prince as he to yeeld to their demands. It ſhould have ſufficed the <hi>Florentines</hi> alſo, and they had gotten a good victory too, if the Spaniſh army gave way to any of their deſires, though they had not fulfilled all of them; for that armies deſign was to change the State of <hi>Florence,</hi> to take away her devotion to <hi>France,</hi> and to draw ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies from her. When of theſe three the people had yeelded to two, which were the laſt, and had gotten themſelves but one, which was the preſervation of their ſtate, they within had each of them gained ſome honour and ſatisfaction,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:30490:173"/>
nor ſhould the people have troubled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for the other two things, one remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them; nor ſhould they have offered, ſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they had been ſure of a certain victory to hazard it at fortunes diſcretion, trying even the extremity thereof, which never any wiſe man will endanger himſelf in, unleſs it be upon neceſſity. <hi>Hanniball</hi> being departed out of <hi>Italy,</hi> where he had been very glorious for ſixteen years, recalled by his own country men the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> to releive his native Country, found <hi>Aſdruball</hi> and <hi>Siphax</hi> defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the Kingdome of <hi>Numidia</hi> loſt, and <hi>Carthage</hi> reſtrain'd within the compaſs of her own walls, which had no other refuge but him and his army: and knowing that was his Countries laſt hopes, he would not hazard it, till he had firſt made trial of all other remedies: nor was he aſham'd to ask peace, judging, that if there was any way to ſave his Country, it was by that, and not by war, which being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed him, though he had been ſure to loſe, he would not faile to fight, thinking that it might fall out ſo, that poſſible it was for him to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and if loſe, it he muſt loſe it gloriouſly. And if <hi>Hanniball,</hi> who was ſo valorous a cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and had his army intire, did require peace, before he would hazard the battell, when he perceived that in loſing it, his country would be ſubdued, what ſhould another of leſs valor and experience then he do? But men run into this error, by not knowing how to limit their hopes, ſo that grounded on their own vaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, without weighing their ſtrengths, they are utterly ruin'd.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>How dangerous a thing it is for a Republick or Prince not to revenge an injury done againſt a publick State, or againſt a private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>WHat, indignation may cauſe men to do, is eaſily known, by that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell the <hi>Romans,</hi> when they ſent the three <hi>Fabij</hi> for Ambaſſadours to the French, who came to invade <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> and in particular <hi>Cluſium:</hi> for the people of <hi>Cluſium,</hi> having ſent to require aide at <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> ſent their Ambaſſadors to the French, to let them know they were to forbear from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king warr againſt the <hi>Tuſcans,</hi> which am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours being upon the place, and fitter to play the Soldiers part, then the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, the French and the <hi>Tuſcans</hi> comming to fight, they rank'd themſelves amongſt the foremoſt to combat the French, whence it came, that being known by them, they converted all the hatred they bore the <hi>Tuſcans</hi> againſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> which hatred became greater: for the French by their Ambaſſadors having complained to the Senate of this injury, and required in ſatisfaction of the dammage, that the aforementioned <hi>Fabij</hi> ſhould be given into their hands, they were not only not given them, or in any other manner puniſhed, but when the time of their Aſſemblies came, they were made Tribuns with Conſular power: inſomuch that the French perceiving thoſe to be honored, that ſhould have been puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:30490:174"/>
took all this as done in deſpight and diſgrace to them: and thus incenſed with rage and diſdain they came to aſſaile <hi>Rome,</hi> which they took, the Capitoll excepted. Which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction fell upon the <hi>Romans,</hi> only for their inobſervance of juſtice: for their Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors having offended againſt the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, when they ſhould have been puniſhed, were honored. Therefore it is worthy conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, how much every Republick or Prince ſhould beware of doing the like wrong, not only againſt a nation, but alſo againſt any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular man: for if a man be exceedingly offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded either by the publick, or by any private man, and hath had no reparation made him to his content: if he lives in a Commonwealth, he will ſeek even with the utter ruine thereof to avenge himſelf: if he lives under a Prince, and be a man of any courage, he will never reſt, till in ſome kind or other he be revenged on him, however that he knows he draws thereby his own deſtruction on his head. And to verify this, there is not a fitter nor truer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, then that of <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders</hi> Father. In his Court there was a very handſome young noble man named <hi>Pauſanias,</hi> and of him one <hi>Attalus,</hi> one of the cheifeſt men, that was neer about <hi>Philip,</hi> was inamourd; who having ſeveral times tryed if he would yeeld to him, and finding him far off from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to any ſuch thing, determined to gain that by a trick and by force, which no way elſe he ſaw he could attain to. And having made a ſolemn invitation, whereat <hi>Pauſanias</hi> and many other noble men met, after that every one had liberally eate and drinke, caus'd <hi>Pauſanias</hi> to be taken and brought to ſome by-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:30490:174"/>
were not only by force he ſatisfied his beaſtly luſt upon him, but the more to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace him, he made him be ſo uſed by many others in the like manner. Of which injury <hi>Pauſanias</hi> ſeveral times made his complaint to <hi>Philip,</hi> who having held him a long time in hope of revenging him, inſtead thereof made <hi>Attalus</hi> governour of a Province in <hi>Greece;</hi> whereupon <hi>Pauſanias</hi> ſeeing his enemy hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and not puniſhed, converted his indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not againſt him that had injured him, but againſt <hi>Philip</hi> that had not aveng'd him. And on a morning when <hi>Philips</hi> daughter was ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly married to <hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Epirus,</hi> as <hi>Philip</hi> went to the Temple to celebrate the eſpouſals, he ſlew him between the two <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders,</hi> the ſon, and the ſon in law. Which example is much like that of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and is remarkeable for all thoſe that rule, who ſhould never value any man at ſo low a rate, as to think (that by heaping injury upon injury) he that is thus wrong'd will not deviſe ſome way to be reveng'd, though it be with his own utter loſs and deſtruction.</p>

                     <p>IF we conſider well the courſe of humane affaires, wee ſhall many times ſee things come to paſs, and chances happen which the heavens altogether would not, that order ſhould be taken to prevent. And in as much as this, which I ſpeak of, befell <hi>Rome,</hi>
                        <pb n="316" facs="tcp:30490:175"/>
where there was ſo much valor, ſo much Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and good order, it is no marvail if the ſame thing often fall out in a City or Country that wants the ſaid things: and becauſe this place is very remarkable to ſhew the power heaven hath over human things, <hi>T. Livius</hi> at large and with words of very great efficacy repreſſes it, ſaying, that the heavens would for ſome end, that the <hi>Romans</hi> ſhould know their power; and therefore caus'd thoſe <hi>Fabij</hi> to erre, that were ſent Ambaſſadors to the French, and by their means provokt them to make war againſt <hi>Rome.</hi> And afterwards or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daind, that for the ſuppreſſing of that war, there was nothing done in <hi>Rome</hi> worthy of the <hi>Romans,</hi> having firſt ordain'd, that <hi>Camillus,</hi> who only was able to remedy ſo great a miſchief ſhould then be baniſhed to <hi>Ardea.</hi> And then the French comming towards <hi>Rome,</hi> they who to reſiſt the fury of the <hi>Volſci</hi> and many their neighbouring enemies, had ſeveral times crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Dictatour; now upon the approach of the French never created any. Moreover, for their choyce of Soldiers, it was very weake, and without any extraordinary diligence: &amp; they were ſo ſlow in taking of arms, that they were hardly time enough to incounter the French at the river <hi>Allia,</hi> ten miles from <hi>Rome.</hi> Here the Tribuns pitcht their campe without any ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary diligence: not viewing the ground firſt, neither incompaſſing it with trench or pali<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ado, making uſe neither of human nor divine helps. And in ranging of their battell, they left their ranks so thin and weak, that as well the Soldiers as the Captains did nothing worthy of the <hi>Roman</hi> diſcipline. They fought afterwards without any effuſion of blood,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:30490:175"/>
for they fled before they were aſſayl'd: the greater part went thence to <hi>Veium,</hi> the other retir'd to <hi>Rome,</hi> who never going into their own houſes, went unto the Capitoll: ſo that the Senate taking no care to defend <hi>Rome,</hi> did not ſo much as ſhut the gates, and part of them fled from thence, and part got into the Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll; yet in defence thereof, they had not ſuch diſorder; for they did not cloy it with unuſual people, they furniſhed it with all the Corne they could poſſibly get, that it might endure out the ſiege: and the greater part of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable multitude of old men, women, and children, fled unto the neighbouring Towns about, the reſt ſtaid at <hi>Rome</hi> for a prey to the French. So that whoever ſhould have read of the brave atchievements of that people many years before, and afterwards of theſe times following them, would have much a do to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve it were the ſame people. And <hi>T. Livius</hi> having reckon'd up the aforeſaid diſorders, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes thus, <hi>So much does fortune</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Adeò obcaecat animos fortuna, cum vim ſuam refringi non vult.</note> 
                        <hi>blind mens eyes, when ſhee would not have her force withſtood.</hi> Nor can this concluſion be more true. Whereupon men that are alwaies under hard croſſes deſerve the leſs blame, as they that enjoy continuall proſperity alſo merit leſs prayſe; for we ſhall many times ſee thoſe led to their deſtruction, and theſe advanc'd to an extraordinory great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by ſome occaſion the heavens have preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in their furtherances hereto, giving means to the one to behave himſelf vertuouſly, &amp; quite bereaving the other of them. And we may well ſay fortune does this, for ſhe makes choyce of a man (when ſhe purpoſes to bring great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to paſs) of ſuch judgement and ſpirit, that
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:30490:176"/>
knows how to make uſe of thoſe occaſions ſhe preſents him. So in like manner, when ſhee would bring horrible deſtructions upon any Place, ſhe there preferrs men to that purpoſe, that they may help to draw on that ruine. And in caſe there be any that may prevent theſe miſchiefes, ſhee either brings him to his end, or elſe deprives him of all abilities to do any goood. This we very well know by our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors diſcourſe, how that fortune for to am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plify <hi>Rome,</hi> and to bring it to that greatneſs it attain'd to, deemd it neceſſary to ſcourge it, as we ſhall diſcourſe at large in the beginning of the next book following, but yet would not wholly ruin it. And this appears, in as much as ſhee baniſhed <hi>Camillus,</hi> but put him not to death: ſhee made <hi>Rome</hi> be taken, but not the Capitoll: ſhee ordein'd that the <hi>Romaus</hi> ſhould not think out any thing of avayle to ſave <hi>Rome;</hi> yet for defence of the Capitoll, they wanted of no good advice. To the end <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould be taken, ſhe cauſd the greater part of thoſe Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that were routed at <hi>Allia,</hi> to go to <hi>Vejum.</hi> And as for defence of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhe cut off all the waies to order it, ſo ſhee prepar'd every thing ready to recover it again, having conducted an intire <hi>Roman</hi> Army to <hi>Vejum,</hi> and <hi>Camillus</hi> to <hi>Ardea,</hi> whereby they might be able to make a ſtrong head under the command of a Captain never blemiſhed with any diſgrace of loſs yet, &amp; throughly whole in his reputation, for the recovery of his Country. Wee might here produce ſome modern example to confirm what wee have ſaid: but becauſe I think it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary, being this may well ſuffice, I ſhall omit it. I avow therefore this to be very true, as by many hiſtories wee may ſee it, that
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:30490:176"/>
men may well follow fortune, but not oppoſe it; they may well weave her webs, but not break them. Wherefore let men never aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don themſelves, being they know not what ſhall become of them in the end, the paſſages of their fortunes being through crooked and unknown waies; they ſhould ever hope, and ſo hoping put on ſtill, and never give over in deſpaire, whatſoever chance or trouble they be faln into.</p>

                     <p>THe <hi>Romans</hi> were ſtraightly beſiegd in the Capitoll, and however they lookt for ayd from <hi>Vejum,</hi> and from <hi>Camillus,</hi> being forc't by famine, they came to termes of agreement with the French, to redeem themſelves for a certain ſum of money, upon which agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as they were weighing the gold, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millus,</hi> arriv'd with his Army, which fortune brought to paſs (ſaies our Hiſtorian) to the end that <hi>the Romans ſhould not live</hi>

But when the ſaid neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, though inferious to it, draw money from thence, there is then a great evidence of the weakneſs thereof.

Wee ſhall ſee the contrary in poor and feeble States; and ſo beginning at ours of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> in the times paſt, even when the reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof was at the greateſt, there was never a great Lord in <hi>Romania,</hi> that had not ſome allowance from thence, and beſides ſhe gave to thoſe of <hi>Perugia,</hi> and <hi>Caſtella,</hi> &amp; to all the reſt of her neighbours. For had this City been warlick and ſtrong, the contrary would have followd; for all thoſe to have been under the protection of it, would have given money, and have ſought to buy its friendſhip, and not to ſell their own. Neither have the <hi>Florentines</hi> alone liv'd in this baſeneſs, but the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and the King of <hi>France,</hi> who, though a Prince of great Dominions, lives tributary to the <hi>Swiſſes,</hi> and the King of <hi>Engl.</hi> The cauſe whereof is, in that he diſarmes his ſubjects, and becauſe that King and thoſe other afore-named had rather enjoy a preſent profit to rack their people and ſqueeſe them, and avoid rather an imaginary than a
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:30490:177"/>
real danger, than do ſuch expedients as would ſecure and for ever make their States happy. Which diſorder, though ſome while it may produce quiet, yet in time it proves the cauſe of want, loſſes, and unrecoverable ruine. And it would be too long to relate, how many times the <hi>Florentines,</hi> the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and this Kingdome, have redeemd themſelves even in the warrs, and how many times they have ſubjected themſelves to diſgrace, which the <hi>Romans</hi> were only once like to have done. It would be tedious to tell, how many Towns the <hi>Florentines</hi> and <hi>Venetians</hi> have bought, whereof afterwards the inconvenience hath been found, and how that thoſe things that are bought with gold, men know not how to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſend with the ſword. The <hi>Romans</hi> obſervd this brave way and manner of living, while they were free; but after they came under their Emperors governments, and that thoſe Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors grow naught, and lov'd the ſhade, and could not endure any toyle in the Sun, they began alſo to redeem themſelves, ſomtimes from the <hi>Parthians,</hi> ſomtimes from the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> and now and then alſo from ſome others of their neighbours, which was the beginning of that great Empires ruine. Whereupon aroſe the like inconvenients from their having diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm'd their people, from whence alſo proceeds another greater, that the nearer thy enemy comes to thee, the weaker he finds thee; for whoſoever lives after that manner we have ſpoken of above, treats evill thoſe ſubjects he hath within his dominions, becauſe his men are not ſo well diſciplin'd in the wars, as to keep the enemy from entring into the heart of their Country Whence it proceeds, that to keep
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:30490:178"/>
the enemy off: he allows ſome proviſion of moneys to thoſe Princes or people that border upon his Country. And thereupon, thoſe States make ſome reſiſtance upon the confines only, which when the enemy hath paſt, they have no kind of remedy left: and they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not, that this their manner of proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is quite contrary to all good order: for the heart and the vital parts of a body are to be arm'd, and not the extremities thereof; for it can live without thoſe, but if theſe be hurt it dyes: but theſe States keep the heart diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm'd, and arme their hands and feet. What this diſorder hath done at <hi>Florence,</hi> hath been and is daily ſeen: for when any Army poſſes the frontiers, and enters near to the heart of the Country, there is no further remedy. Wee ſaw not long ſince the ſame proof of the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians;</hi> and had not their. City been begirt by the waters, we ſhould have ſeen an end of it. Wee have not ſo often ſeen this tryal in <hi>France,</hi> becauſe it is ſo great a Kingdom, that it hath few enemies mightier than it: nevertheleſs. when the Engliſh invaded that Country in the year 1513. the whole Country quak'd, and the King himſelf, and every one thought, that one defeat alone would have been ſufficient to loſe him the State. The contraty befell the <hi>Romans;</hi> for the nearer the enemy approached to <hi>Rome,</hi> the more able he found the City to make reſiſtance. And it was evident, when <hi>Hannibal</hi> came into <hi>Italy,</hi> that after three defeats, and the ſlaughters of ſo many Captains and ſoldiers, they were not only able to ſuſtain the enemy, but to vanquiſh him. All this proceeded from that they had well armd the heart, and made ſmall account of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities;
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:30490:178"/>
for the foundation of their State was the people of <hi>Rome;</hi> and the Latins, and the other Townes their allyes in <hi>Italy,</hi> and their Colonies, from whence they drew ſo many Soldiers, that with them they were able to fight with and keep in awe the whole world. And that this is true, it appears by the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Hanno</hi> the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> put to <hi>Hannibals</hi> agents, after that great overthrow at <hi>Canna,</hi> who having exceedingly magnified <hi>Hannibals</hi> great acts, were asked by <hi>Hanno,</hi> whether any of the <hi>Komans</hi> were yet come to demand peace, or if any Town of the Latins, or any of their Colonies had yet rebelld againſt the <hi>Roman;</hi> and they denying the one and the other, <hi>Hanno</hi> reply'd, Then is the warr yet as intire as it was at firſt. We ſee therefore by this diſcourſe, and what wee have otherwhere ſaid, what diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence there is between the proceedings of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicks now adayes, and thoſe of the ancients. Wee ſee alſo hereupon every day exceeding great loſſes, and wonderfull great conqueſts: for where men are but of ſmall valour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, fortune ſhews much power: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhee is alwaies various, therefore do Common-wealths and States change often, and will alwaies change, till at length ſome one ſtand up, who is ſo much a lover of antiquitie, as to regulate her, that ſhe take not occaſion to ſhew at every turne of the Sun, how great her power is.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>MEthinks it is not out of purpoſe, to treat among theſe other diſcourſes, how dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous a thing it is to truſt thoſe that are baniſhed out of their Country, theſe being matters that every day are practiſ'd by thoſe that are Rulers of States; eſpecially ſeeing it may be prov'd by a memorable example out of <hi>T. Livius</hi> in his hiſtory, though this thing be out of his purpoſe quite. When <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great paſſed into <hi>Aſia</hi> with his Army, <hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Epirus</hi> his kinſman &amp; uncle, came with certain troopes into <hi>Italy,</hi> being cald upon by ſome outlawd <hi>Lucans,</hi> who put him in hope, that by their means he might become maſter of that whole Country. Whereupon it came to paſs, that he being come into <hi>Italy</hi> upon their word and aſſurance, was ſlain by them; their Citizens, having promiſd them their return into their Country, if they ſlew him. Therefore ſhould it be conſider'd, how vain their words and promiſes are, who are baniſhed their Countries; for, in regard of their word, it is to be thought, that whenſoever by other means than thine, they can be reſtord to their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, they will forſake thee, and cleave to others, notwithſtanding all the promiſes they have made thee. And this is the reaſon why there is no hold to their word, becauſe ſo extream is their deſire to return to to their native homes, that naturally they beleeve many things that
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:30490:179"/>
are falſe, and ſome things out of their own cunning they adde; ſo that between what they think, and what they ſay they think, they put thee in ſuch hopes, that grounding thereupon, thou art brought to a vain expence, or to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake ſomwhat that proves thy deſtruction. I will ſatisfie my ſelf with the aforeſaid exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Alexander,</hi> and only this other of <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtocles</hi> the <hi>Athenian,</hi> who being outlawd, fled to <hi>Darius</hi> in <hi>Aſia,</hi> where he promiſed him ſo much, when he ſhould invade <hi>Greece,</hi> that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> undertook the enterpriſe. But <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> not being able to make good his promiſes, either for ſhame or fear of puniſhment, poiſoned himſelf. And if <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> a rare man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted this error, what ſhould we think but that they do much more erre, who becauſe of their leſs vertue will ſuffer themſelves to be more violently drawn by their own paſſions and deſires. And therefore a Prince ought to proceed very ſlowly in undertakings upon the relation of exil'd men; for otherwiſe he ſuffers either great ſhame, or dammage by them And becauſe it ſeldom comes to paſs, that Towns and Countries are taken by ſtealth, or by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence that any one hath in them; methinks it is not much out of purpoſe to treate thereof in the Chapter following, adding thereunto by how many waies the <hi>Romans</hi> got them.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>How many waies the Romans uſed to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves maſters of townes.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THe Romans applying themſelves all to the war, did evermore make it with all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage poſſible, as well for the expence, as for every thing elſe belonging thereto. From hence it proceeded, that they were alwaies aware of taking of townes by long ſieges, thinking it a matter of great charges, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodity, that ſurpaſſes far the profit their conqueſt thereof can bring. And for this cauſe they though it more for their own advantage, to take a town any way elſe then by ſiege. Whereupon in ſuch great and ſo many wars, we have very few examples of ſieges made by them. The waies then whereby they got their townes, were either by conqueſt or yeil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. And this conqueſt was either by force or open violence, or by force mingled with fraud. Open violence was either by aſſault, without beating the walls, which was to <hi>beleagure a town round with an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my:</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Agred urbem coronâ</note> for they environd it, and combatted it on all parts, and many times it prov'd ſo luckily to them, that in one aſſault they took a town, though a very vaſt one, as when <hi>Scipio</hi> took new Carthage in Spain. Or when this aſſault ſerved not, they betook them to break down the walls with their rams, and oher their
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:30490:180"/>
warlike engines, or elſe by ſome mine or vault they made, whereby they enter'd the City, by which way the took the City of Veium; or to make themſelves equal in height with thoſe that defended the walls, they made towres of wood, or caſt up mountains of earth, which leaned upon the wall on the outſide, whereby they might get to the hight of it. Againſt theſe aſſaults, they that defended the towns, in the firſt caſe in regard of their being beſing'd round, rannne a more ſudden hazard, and had more doubtfull remedies: for having need in every place of many defendants, perchance either thoſe that they had, were not ſo many as could ſupply every place, or change often to refreſh them: or if they could, they were not all of equal courage to make reſiſtance: and in caſe the skirmiſh had inclin'd in any part, all had bin loſt. Therefore it came to paſs (as I ſaid) that this way lit many times on good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. But when it ſucceeded not at firſt, they did not much more try that way, becauſe it was dangerous for the army: for the City be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able for ſo long a ſpace to defend it ſelf, the army could not but grow weak, and hardly be able to withſtand any fally of the enemies from within, and beſides the ſoldiers diſorder'd and wearied themſelves hereby, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding for once, and that on the ſudden, they aſſayld that way) As for the breaking down of the walls, they made reſiſtance as they do now adayes with new reparations, and againſt their mines, they made countermines, and thereby they oppos'd their enemies either with their armes in hand, or with other engines, &amp; among others this was one, they fill'd divers veſſels with feathers, and ſet fire on them, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:30490:181"/>
thus kindled they put into the Mine, ſo that by the ſmoke and ſtink thereof, the enemy was hindred of entring thereinto: and if they aſſail<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d them with towers of wood, they ſought to fire them. And for the mounts of earth, they commonly broke open the wall underneath, whereupon the mount did lean, drawing thence the earth into the town, whereby they without did raiſe their mount, ſo that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they brought the earth without, being that they within carried it away, the mount came to no great matter. Theſe waies of aſſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling cannot be continued long: for they muſt either riſe from the ſiege, and ſeek by other means to make an end of the war, as <hi>Seipio</hi> did when being entred into Affricke he aſſaulted Vtica, but could not take it, he roſe thence with his whole camp, and ſought how to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow the Carthaginian armies; or elſe they muſt turne again to the ſiege, as they did at Veium, Capua, Carthage, and Ieruſalem, and other like townes, which they took by ſiege. As for conqueſt by force and fraud, as it befel Palepolis, it chanced that the Romans, by treating with the inhabitants took ſome towne. But by his aſſailing the Romans and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, tried many, but prevail'd in few: the reaſon is, becauſe every ſmall impediment breakes the deſigne, and impediments eaſily happen: for either the conſpiracie is diſcover'd before it takes effect; and without much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie it is diſcovered, as well through their infidelity, to whom it is communicated, as by the difficulty to put it in practiſe, being they are to agreee with enemies with whom they cannot parly, but under ſome other colour. But in caſe the conſpiracy be not diſcloſed in
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:30490:181"/>
the ordering of it, there ariſe multitudes of difficulties in putting it in execution: for if either thou commeſt before the time appointed, or after, all is ſpoiled, if any falſe alarme be given, as was that of the geeſe in the Capitol; if any uſual order be broken, every little error, or affright taken, ſpoiles the deſigne. Hereunto may be added the darkneſs of the night which often puts in fear the rather thoſe that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take ſuch perilous things. And the greater part of thoſe men that are brought upon ſuch enterpriſes, being unexperienced in the ſcitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, the countrey, and the places, whether they areled, become aſtoniſhed, diſheartned, and confuſed upon every ſmall accident ſhall happen; And every ſhadow is of force to make them run away. Nor ever was there any more happy in thefe fraudulent night plots, then <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratus Sicioneus,</hi> who was as baſe and coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in any action by day, as he was of worth and ſpirit in theſe by night. Which we may well think was rather through ſome hidden vertue wherewith he was endowed, then becauſe there was naturally required in them the more good luck. Many of theſe waies are put in practice, few of them come to trial, and very few take effect. Touching the gaining of townes by yeelding, they yeeld either of good will or by force: this willingneſs ariſes either upon ſome forrain neceſſity, which compels them to fly unto thy protection, as Capua did unto the Romans, or through a deſire to be wel gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, being allur'd by the good government that Prince holds among them that have given themſelves into his hands: as the Rodians, the Maſſilians, and other like cities did, that gave themſelves unto the Romans. Touching
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:30490:182"/>
ſurrendring up upon force, proceeds either from a long ſiege, as is formerly ſaid, or from a continual oppreſſion of incurſions, pillagings, and other hard uſages, which when a city de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to be freed from ſhe yeelds her ſelf. Of all thoſe ſaid ways the Romans practiſed this laſt more then foure hundred and fifty years to weary out their neighbors with routs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions, and by gaining credit with them, by gaining credit with them, by means of agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments made, as we have ſaid otherwhere; and upon that way they alwaies grounded, though they tryd all, but in the other they found things either dangerous or unprofitable. For in a ſiege, there is length of time and expences: in forcible aſſault, doubt and danger: and in conſpiracies, uncertainty. And they ſaw, that by the defeat of an enemies army, ſometimes they got a Kingdom in one day, and to take by ſiege a town that was obſtinate, it coſt them many years.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>I Think it fit for him (that by reading of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies</hi> ſtory would make advantage thereof) wel to conſider all the waies of the people and Senate of Romes proceedings: and among other things that merite conſideration, his is one, to ſee with what authority they ſent forth their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls, Dictators, &amp; Commanders of armies, which we ſee was very great, and the Senate reſerved
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:30490:182"/>
thing elſe to themſelves, but a power to make new wars, and to confirme peace, but they referred every thing elſe to the arbitrement and power of the Conſul: for when the people and the Senate had once reſolved on the war, (as for example ſake againſt the Latines) they left all the reſt to the Conſuls diſcretion, who had free power either to fight a batttel, or to leave it, and to beſiege either this, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther town elſe as he pleas'd. Which things by many examples are verified, and eſpecially by that which fell out in an expedition againſt the Tuſcans: for <hi>Fabius</hi> the Conſul having over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them near unto Sutrium, and intending with his army to paſs the wood Cimina, and go into Tuſcany, he did not onely not adviſe with the Senate, but gave them no notice at all of it, though he was to make the war in a new countrey full of doubts and dangers: which is witneſſed by a reſolution of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate taken directly againſt this very courſe; who having underſtood of the victory <hi>Fabius</hi> had gotten, and doubting he would venture to paſs the ſaid woods into Tuſcany, thinking it would be well not to try that war, nor ruin that hazzard, ſent two Deputies unto <hi>Fabius,</hi> to give him notice, they would not have him paſs into Tuſcany: who came thither, when he had already paſt, and gotten the victory, and in liew of hindring the war, they returned Ambaſſadors of his conqueſt and victory gotten. And whoſoever conſiders theſe termes, will find them diſcreetly uſed: for if the Senate would have had the Conſull to proceed on forwards in the war, onely as they gave him order, they had made him leſs circumſpect,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:30490:183"/>
and ſlower in his actions: for he would have thought, that the glory of the victory had not bin wholly his, but that the Senate had parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipated with him, by whoſe counſe he had bin governed. Beſides this, the Senate then obliged themſelves to adviſe in things they could not have the means to underſtand. For, notwithſtanding than among them there were men exceedingly well experienced in the wars, yet being they were not upon the place, and therefore ignorant of very many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, which are needfull for him to know that will adviſe well, by interpoſing their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, they would have committed many errors. And for this cauſe they ſuffered the Conſul to do all of himſelf, and that the glory thereof ſhould be entirely his, the love of which they thought would provoke and encourage him to do well. I have the more willingly marked this place, becauſe I ſee that the Republiques now adayes, as the Venetian and the Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, underſtand it not ſo: and if their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, Proveditours, and Commiſſioners are to plant any battery, they will know it firſt, and adviſe thereupon.

was not neceſſary not only to maintain religion and juſtice, but to eſteem well of their good Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, &amp; to make more account of their vertue, than of thoſe profits, which they thought they loſt or got by their means: Which we ſee, came directly to paſs; for preſently after <hi>Rome</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered from the French, they renewed all the rites of their ancient Religion, they puniſhed thoſe <hi>Fabij</hi> who fought againſt the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and afterwards made ſuch account of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millus</hi> his vertue and goodneſs, that the Senate &amp; all others wholly laying envy aſide, gave the whole government of the Commonwealth into hit hands. It is neceſſary therefore (as I have ſaid) that men, who live together in any order, ſhould often reviſe themſelves, either upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion given by outward, or elſe by inward ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents. And for theſe laſt, they muſt either pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from a law, which may take a review as it were of the men that are in that body, or elſe from ſome good man that may ariſe among them, who by his example &amp; vertuous actions may work the ſame effect, which that law or order can. This good then ariſes in Common-wealths, by the vertue of ſome man, or the force of ſome order. And touching this laſt, thoſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that reduc'd the <hi>Roman</hi> Republick to its own beginning, were the <hi>Tribuns</hi> of the people, the Cenſors, &amp; all thoſe other laws, which were made againſt the ambition or inſolence of men, which orders have need to be quicken'd by the vertue of ſome one Citizen, that couragiouſly joynes with them for their execution, maugre the power of thoſe that break them. The exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions whereof, before the ſacking of <hi>Rome</hi> by the French, were notable, the death of <hi>Brutus</hi> his ſons, the death of thoſe of the <hi>Decemvirate,</hi>
                        <pb n="336" facs="tcp:30490:185"/>
that of <hi>Melius</hi> touching the laying down the price of their corne: after the taking of Rome, was the death of <hi>Manlius Capitolinus,</hi> the death of the ſon of <hi>Manlius Torquatus,</hi> the execution which <hi>Papirius Curſor</hi> did upon the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his Cavallerie, the accuſation of the <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pios:</hi> which things being they were extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry &amp; remarkable, whenoſever any of them did chance, cauſed men more ſtrictly to conforme themſelves to the exact rule; and when theſe began to fall out ſeldom, then began they to give men more leiſure to grow naught, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more dangerous and tumultuous; for from one to another of ſuch like executions, there ſhould not paſs more than ten years time; for after ſuch a time men begin again to change their manners and treſpaſs againſt the lawes: and unleſs ſomething chance, which anew calls the puniſhment to memory, and puts them in fear thereof, there meer together ſo many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents, that without danger they cannot be puniſhed. To this purpoſe, they who govern'd the State of Florence from 1434. to 1494. ſaid it was neceſſary every fift year to reforme the State, otherwiſe it was hard to maintain it; and they call'd reforming of the State, to put that terror and fear in men, which they caus'd in them at the firſt founding of the lawes, having then ſeverely puniſh'd thoſe that had offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded againſt their manner of living. But when the memory of that puniſhment is once extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, men again take the boldneſs to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt ſome innovations, and ſpeak ill of the preſent State: and therefore it is neceſſary to take order for it by reducing it to the firſt grounds. Alſo this bringing back of Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques to their beginnings, ariſes ſometimes
<pb facs="tcp:30490:185"/>
                        <pb facs="tcp:30490:186"/>
                        <pb n="337" facs="tcp:30490:186"/>
from the plain vertue of ſome one man, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out dependance on any law, inciting thee to any execution: yet are they of ſo great reputation, and of ſuch remarke, that the good men deſire to follow them, and the bad are aſham'd to live contrarily to them. Thoſe that in <hi>Rome</hi> particularly worked theſe good effects, were <hi>Horatius Cocles, Scevola, Fabritius,</hi> the two <hi>Decij, Regulus, Attilius,</hi> and ſome others, who by their rare and worthy examples, in <hi>Rome</hi> wrought the ſame effect that good lawes and good orders could. And if the forenamed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutions of lawes together with theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars examples had ſucceeded every ten years in this City, it had been of neceſſary conſequence that it could never be corrupted: but as the one and the other of theſe two things began to fall out ſeldome, the corruptions multiplied: for after <hi>Marcus Regulus</hi> the like example was never more ſeen. And though in <hi>Rome</hi> there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe the two <hi>Catoes,</hi> yet ſuch was the diſtance between him and them, and between them, from th'one to th'other, and they remained ſo alone, that with their good examples they could effectuate no good thing, and eſpecially the laſt <hi>Cato,</hi> who finding a great part of the City corrupted, could not prevaile ſo by his example, as to better his Citizens And this may ſuffice for Republicks. But touching Religions, wee ſee alſo theſe reformations are neceſſary, by example of our Religion: which had it not been reduc'd again to its principles by Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> and Saint <hi>Dominique,</hi> it would have been quite defac'd: for theſe by their poverty, and their imitation of Chriſts life, made a new impreſſion thereof in mens minds, which was quite blotted our thence: and their new rules
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:30490:187" rendition="simple:additions"/>
were ſo powerfull, and now are the cauſe that the diſhoneſty of the Prelates, and the heads of the Religion, do not ruine it, partly by their living in poverty, and partly by the great cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit they have in confeſſing the people, and preaching to them, whereby they give them to underſtand that it is evill, to ſpeak evil againſt him that is evill; and that it is good, rather to live in obedience to them; and if they are faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to leave them to the chaſtiſement of God. And ſo they offend the moſt they can; for they feare not the puniſhment they ſee not, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve not. This reformation then hath and does maintain this Religion. Kingdomes alſo have need of reforming and reſtoring their laws to their firſt beginnings. And wee ſee how much good this does in the Kingdom of <hi>France;</hi> Which Kingdom is governed more by its lawes and cuſtomes than any other Kingdom elſe. Of which lawes and cuſtomes, the Parliaments are the principal maintainers, and eſpecially that of <hi>Paris,</hi> which reſtores them again to life, whenſoever it makes any execution againſt a Prince of the Realm, and that they condemn the King in their ſentences: and till this preſent it hath maintained it ſelf, by being an obſtinate executioner againſt that Nobility: but when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it ſhould ſuffer any of their faults to eſcape unpuniſhed, and they chance to multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, without doubt it would come to paſs that either they were to be corrected with great diſorder, or that Kingdom come to a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution. Therefore we conclude that there is nothing more neceſſary in a politick govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Sect, Kingdom, or Commonwealth that it be, than to reſtore it to that reputation which in its firſt beginning it had, and take a care that
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:30490:187"/>
either the cuſtomes be good, or the men good, that they may rather work this effect, that it be not left to ſome forraign force to do it: For (however that ſometimes it be an excellent remedy, as it prov'd to <hi>Rome)</hi> yet is it ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, that it is in no caſe to be deſir'd: And to make it appear to any man, how much the actions of particular men ſerved to advance <hi>Romes</hi> greatneſs, and wrought many good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in that City, I will come to the narration and diſcourſe of them, within the bounds whereof wee will conclude this third Book, and laſt part of this firſt decade. And howbeit the Kings actions were great and remarkable, being the Hiſtory ſets them down at large, we ſhall omit them, nor ſpeak of them otherwiſe, unleſs it be touching ſome thing they did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to their private advantage; and here we will begin with <hi>Brutus,</hi> Father of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> liberty.</p>

                     <p>NO man was ever reputed ſo ſage or wiſe for any thing that ever he did, as <hi>Junius Brutus</hi> deſerves to be accounted for taking upon him the perſon of a fool; and though <hi>Titus Livius</hi> expreſſes no other but one rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to induce him thereto, which was to live in ſecurity, and preſerve his patrimony; yet if we conſider his manner of proceeding, we may beleeve, that he thus diſſembled, to the end he might be leſs obſerved, &amp; have the more
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:30490:188"/>
conveniency to ſuppreſs the Kings, and free his Country, upon any occaſion offered. And that he thought upon this, it appears firſt in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation he made of <hi>Apolloes</hi> Oracle, when he fained to fall down, that he might kiſs the ground, deeming thereby that the Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd his deſignes; and afterwards when at the occaſion where <hi>Lucretia</hi> was ſlain, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Father, husband, and other of her kindred, he was the firſt that drew the knife out of the wound, and made thoſe that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſweare they would never more endure in time to come a King in <hi>Rome.</hi> From his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are thoſe to learn, that are diſcontented with any Prince: and firct they ſhould meaſure and weigh their own forces: and if they are ſo powerfull, that they are able to diſcover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as enemies, and openly make war againſt him, then ought they plainly go that way, as leaſt dangerous and the morehonorable. But if they be of ſuch condition, that they are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to enter into termes of open hoſtilitie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, then ought they to uſe al induſtry in ſeeking to gain his favour; and to this effect enter into him by all thoſe waies that are fit, following him in his ſports, and taking pleaſure in all thoſe things they ſee he delights in. This familiarity firſt cauſes thee to live ſecure, and without running any hazard, gives thee means to enjoy that Princes good fortune with him, and layes the way open to thee to ſatisfie thy own mind. It is true that ſome ſay, they would not ſtand ſo near the Princes, as to be oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with their ruines, nor ſo far off, but that when their ruine comes, they may be able time enough to riſe upon ſome part of their ruines. Which middle way would be the trueſt, were
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:30490:188"/>
it rightly kept. But becauſe I think it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, it is meet to reduce it to the two waies above mentioned, which is either to be at large from them, or cleave cloſe to them. Hee that does otherwiſe, if he be a man of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent qualities, lives in continuall danger. Nor ſufficeth it to ſay, I care not for any thing, I deſire neither honors, nor wealth, I will live quietly, and without entring into any faction; for theſe excuſes are heard, but paſs not as cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. Neither can men of quality chuſe this ſtanding quiet, however that heartily they make choyce of it and without any ambition, becauſe they are not beleeved in it, in ſo much as though they themſelves would, yet others will not let them live ſo. They muſt then play the fool as <hi>Brutus</hi> did; and he plaies the fool a great deal, that prayſes, and prates to them, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at, and bears a part in thoſe things that are againſt his own mind, to comply with his Princes delights.

                        <p>That it was neceſſary, for preſervation of the new gotten liberty, to put <hi>Brutus</hi> his ſons to death.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>B <hi>Butus</hi> his ſeverity was no leſs neceſſary than uſefull to maintain <hi>Rome</hi> in the liberty ſhe had gotten, which was of rare ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in all memorials of things happen'd, to ſee the Father ſit on his Tribunal, and not
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:30490:189"/>
only condemn his ſons to death, but be preſent and aſſiſtant at it. And this is alwaies well known to thoſe that read ancient ſtories, how that after the change of a State, either from a Republick into a Tyranny, or from a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny into a Republick, ſome memorable execution upon the enemies of the preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is needfull. And hee that ſets up a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, and flaies not <hi>Brutus;</hi> and hee that brings in liberty, and ſlayes not <hi>Brutus</hi> his ſons, can hardly ſubſiſt. And becauſe for merly wee have diſcourſed hereof at large, I referr my ſelf to what was then ſpoken hereof. I ſhall alledge here only one example which was in our times, and in our Country: that of <hi>Peter Soderini,</hi> who thought with his patience and goodneſs to overcome that paſſionate deſire which was in the ſons of <hi>Brutus,</hi> to return under another government, but deceived him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf therein. And albeit hee by his wiſdome perceived well this neceſſity, and that the way and ambition of thoſe that ſhov'd againſt him, gave him occaſion to extinguiſh them, yet hee never bent his mind to it: for beſides his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion that he was able by patience and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to worke out all ill humors, and by libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality towards them, to weare out any enmity was borne againſt him, hee was of advice (as many times by diſcourſe hee ſhewed ſome of his friends) that if hee would ſtrongly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter the oppoſitions were made againſt him, and maſter his adverſaries, he had need take upon him extraordinary authority, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he ſhould break the civil equality among them. Which thing (however that hee ſhould never afterwards act tyrannically) would ſo much affright the multitude, that they would
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:30490:189"/>
never agree after his death to create a new ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard-bearer for life, which dignity he held fit to put forward and maintain. This reſpect was wiſe and good: yet muſt we never ſuffer any evill to continue in regard of a good, being that good may eaſily be ſuppreſt by that evill. And he ſhould beleeve, being his actions and his intentions were to bee judged by their end (in caſe that good fortune and life ſhould have accompanied him) that he could have aſſured every one, how that what he had done, was for the ſafety of his Country, not for his own ambition, whereby he might have been able to regulate things in ſuch a manner, that no ſucceſſor of his could do that for evill, which hee had done for good. But the firſt opinion deceived him, not knowing that malice is not abated by time, nor appeaſed by any good turne. So that becauſe he was ignorant how to imitate <hi>Brutus,</hi> he loſt together with his Country the State, and his own reputation. And as it is a hard thing to ſave a free State, ſo is it not eaſie to preſerve a Monarchy, as in the Chapter following it ſhall be ſhewed.</p>

And we ſee how <hi>Tarquinius
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:30490:190"/>
Priſons</hi> was deceived in thinking legally to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs that Kingdom, in that it was given him by the people, and confirm'd by the Senate. Neither did he beleeve that diſdain could ſo much prevaile with <hi>Ancus</hi> his ſons, that they would not be ſatisfied, with what all <hi>Rome</hi> was contented. And <hi>Servius Tullus</hi> deluded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in thinking he could with new obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons gain the good will of <hi>Tarquins</hi> ſons. So that touching the firſt, every Prince may well be adviſd that he cannot live ſure of his Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality, while they live who were bereavd of it. Touching the ſecond, every one that is of power may well remember, that never were old injuries cancelld with new favours, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when the new favours are leſs of value than the wrongs done And without all doubt <hi>Servius Tullus</hi> was nothing wiſe to think that <hi>Tarquins</hi> ſons would patiently endure to be his ſons in law, whoſe King they thought by right they ought to be. And this deſire of reigning is ſo great, that it not only enters their breaſts, that look to ſucceed in the Kingdome, but they alſo who no waies expect it.

                        <hi>TArquinius</hi> the proud having ſtain <hi>Servius Tullus,</hi> and of him no heirs remaining behind, came to poſſeſs the Kingdom ſecurely, having no cauſe to feare, thoſe things that had hurt his predeceſſours. And however his way of getting the Kingdom had been ſo extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, and odious, yet had he obſervd the ancient cuſtomes of the other Kings, he would have been borne with: nor would the Senate nor the Commonalty have riſen againſt him to wreſt the State out of his hands. Hee was not then baniſhed becauſe his ſon <hi>Sextus</hi> raviſht <hi>Lucretia,</hi> but for that he had broken the laws of the kingdome, and ruld tyrannouſly, having taken all authority from the Senate, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved it wholly to himſelf, and thoſe affaires, which had been diſpatcht in publick by the Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> with generall ſatſsfaction, he reduc'd to be treated in his own Palace, which gain'd him both blame and envie: ſo that in a very ſhort time he deſpoyld <hi>Rome</hi> of all that liberty which ſhe had alwaies maintained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der others. Nor was this enough to make the Senate his enemy, but he provok'd the people alſo againſt him, tiring them out in baſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanick ſervices, and ſuch as were far dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from that, wherein his anceſtors had imployd them: ſo that having repleniſh'd <hi>Rome</hi> with examples of his cruelty and pride, he had now diſpoſ'd all the <hi>Romans</hi> minds to rebellion, whenſoever occaſion ſhould be off r'd And had not that accident of <hi>Lucretia</hi> fallen
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:30490:191"/>
out, ſo ſoon as any other ſhould have chanc'd, it would have produc'd the ſame effect: for if <hi>Tarquinius</hi> had liv'd, as the other Kings did, and <hi>Sextus</hi> his ſon had committed that offence, <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> &amp; <hi>Collatinus</hi> would have had recourſe to <hi>Tarquinius,</hi> for revenge againſt <hi>Sextus,</hi> and not to the people of <hi>Rome.</hi> Therefore let Princes know, that at the ſame houre they begin to loſe the State, when they begin to violate the Laws, &amp; and thoſe manners &amp; cuſtoms that are ancient, under which men have liv'd a long time. And in caſe they come to loſe their State, and ſhould ever become ſo wiſe as to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand with what facility they maintain their Principalities, who follow good counſell, they themſelves would much more lament their loſs &amp; blame themſelves more than others would: for it is much eaſier to be belov'd by the good, than by the bad; &amp; to obey the Laws, than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand over them. And if they would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what courſe they were to take, whereby to put this in practice, and that they are not to undergo greater labour than to view the lives of good Princes, &amp; take them for looking-glaſſes, ſuch as were <hi>Timoleon</hi> the <hi>Corinthian,</hi> &amp; <hi>Aratus Sicioneus,</hi> &amp; ſuch like, in whoſe lives they ſhall find ſecurity &amp; ſatisfaction, as well of him that rules, as of him that is ruled, they would have a deſire to become like them, being able for the reaſons alledgd to do ſo; for men, when they are well governd, ſeek after no other liberty, as it befell the people that were governd by the two were named before, who were conſtraind to be Princes whiles they liv'd, however they tryed many times to retire themſelves to a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate life.

To the end there of that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces may learn to beware of theſe dangers, and private men be more fearful to thruſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into them, or rather learn to content themſelves to live under that rule which their fortune hath allotted them, I ſhall ſpeak there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of more at large, not omitting any thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, that may ſerve for inſtruction of the one or the other.

                        </gap>ed ſome particulars, ſomwhat more than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, inſomuch that they long to be revengd on him: and they are the more incited hereto, by the general hatred they find conceivd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. A Prince then ought to avoyd theſe publick blames, and how he ſhould behave himſelf to avoid them (having treated other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where) I will not now middle: for if he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware well of them, offences againſt particulars ſhall be of ſmall force to hurt him: one reaſon is, becauſe Princes ſeldom light upon men that are ſo ſenſible of an injury as to run ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream hazard to revenge them; the other is, that though they were of ſuch reſolution, and force, as might ſerve to do it, yet would that general good will of men to that Prince withhold them from it. The injuries muſt be either touching the fortunes, lives, or honors. Of thoſe that are touching mens lives, the threats are more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous than the execution, or rather the threats are very dangerous; but in the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on there is no danger at all; for he that is dead cannot think upon revenge; and thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main alive, moſt commonly leave to think of
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:30490:192"/>
him that is dead: but he that is threatned, and ſees himſelf put to a point, either to do or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, becomes a very dangerous man to the Prince, as we ſhall ſay particularly in due place. The fortunes and honours of a man are thoſe two things which excepting this neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, touch men more nearely then any other offence, where of a Prince ſhould be wel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware: for he can never ſtrip a man ſo bare, but that he may find a kinfe to revenge himſelf, nor ſo much diſhonour any one, but that he may ſtill hold an obſtinate reſolution of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance. And touching honours, the diſhono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of women is of moſt importance, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this the ſcorne and diſgrace of their perſons. This armed <hi>Pauſanias</hi> againſt <hi>Philip</hi> of Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and this hath put weapons in many others hands againſt divers Princes. And in our dayes <hi>Julius Belanti</hi> had no other motive to conſpire againſt <hi>Pandulphus</hi> the tyrant of <hi>Siena,</hi> but onely for that he had given him one of his daughters to wife and afterwards taken her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from him, as in its place we ſhall relate. The greateſt cauſe the Pazzi had to conſpire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Medici, was, the inheritance of <hi>John Bonroſnei,</hi> whereof they were diſpoſſeſs'd by their order. And another cauſe, and a very great one too, why men plot treachery againſt a Prince, is a deſire which they have to free their countrey, which hath bin ſeis'd on by him. This mov'd <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Caſſius</hi> againſt <hi>Caeſar.</hi> This incited many others againſt <hi>Falaris, Dionyſius,</hi> and ſuch other uſurpers of their Countries. Nor can any Tyrant free himſelf from the danger of his humor by other means then by laying down his Tyranny. And becauſe we find none will doe this, there are but few of
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:30490:193"/>
them that come not to ill ends; Which gave <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venal</hi> occaſion to ſay,

                     <p>The dangers that (as I ſaid before) accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany conſpiracies, are great, and continual: for in ſuch caſes there is danger in plotting them, in executing them, and after they are executed too. Thoſe that conſpire, are either one or more; that of one cannot be termed a conſpiracy, but a ſetled reſolution bred in a man to ſlay a Prince. This alone of all the three dangers, which conſpiracies hazard, is free from the firſt. For before the putting it in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, it carries no hazard with it, being none is made privy to his ſecret, nor is there any danger, that his purpoſe come to the Princes eare. A reſolution after this ſort may happen to be found in any man of any condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, little or great, Noble or ignoble, famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar or not familiar with he Prince: for at ſome times it is permitted to any man to ſpeak with him and; he that comes to ſpeak with him may vent this paſſion of his minde. <hi>Pauſanias,</hi> of whom we have otherwhere ſpoken, ſlew <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> of Macodon, as he was going to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple environ'd with a thouſand armed men, and between his own ſon and ſon in law; but he was one of the Nobles, and well known to the Prince. A poore and abject Spaniard ſtrook <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of Spain with a knife in the neck; however the wound was not mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, yet hereby it appeared, that he had both courage and opportunity to do it. A Turkiſh Prieſt nam'd <hi>Dervis,</hi> drew a ſcimitarre againſt
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:30490:193"/>
                        <hi>Bajazet,</hi> father of this preſent Turk, but hit him not, yet wanted he neither courage nor commodity for his purpoſe. Of this ſort of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions thus bent, I think there are many, that would do it: for in willing this, there is neither puniſhment, nor danger at all, but few venture to act it; and of thoſe that do, excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding few or none there are, that are not ſlaine in the act. Therefore no man willingly will thruſt himſelfe upon a certaine death. But let us leave theſe ſingle reſolutions, and come to conſider the conſpiracies have bin made by great men, or thoſe that are very familiar with the Prince: for others (unleſs they be ſtark mad) will never offer to conſpire: for mean men, and not familiar with the Prince, want all thoſe conveniencies, which are required in the executing of a conſpiracy.

                        </gap>, mean men cannot find thoſe that will be true to them: for no one man can apply himſelf to their wills for any of thoſe hopes which cauſe men to adventure upon deſperate dangers, ſo that when they have enlarged themſelves to two or three perſons, ſome one of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes an accuſer, and ruines all. But in caſe they ſhould be ſo happy, that none ſhould diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their plots, yet in the execution are they beſet with ſuch difficulties having not free ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs unto the Prince) that it is impoſſible, but that there in they muſt periſh: for if great men, who ordinarily come near him, are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd with ſuch difficulties, which we ſhall preſently mention, it muſt needs be that with thoſe theſe difficulties muſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually increaſe. Therefore men (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe where there is loſſe both of life
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:30490:194"/>
and fortunes they are not ſtark mad) when they find themſelves weak, are well aware of what they do: and when they are very wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of a Prince, they are contented onely to curſe him, and expect, while thoſe that are of higher quality then themſelves, do avenge them. And yet in caſe that any of ſuch like as theſe ſhould have aſſailed any thing, the deſign they had might well be laudable, but not their wiſdome. We ſee therefore, that thoſe that have conſpired, were all great men, or familiar with the Prince: Whereof many have conſpired, as well being mov'd by too many favors, as by too many injuries. As <hi>Perennius</hi> was againſt <hi>Commodus, Plautianus</hi> againſt <hi>Severus, Sejanus</hi> againſt <hi>Tiberius.</hi> All theſe were by their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors ſo enriched with wealth, and dignified with titles and honours, that it ſeemed there wanted not any thing to perfect their power but the Empire it ſelf, which they meaning not to fail of, betook themſelves to conſpire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Prince, and their treaſons all had that end, which their ingratitude well deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. However that among thoſe of this ſort in theſe latter times that of <hi>Iacob Apianus</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Petrus Gambacorti</hi> Prince of Piſa ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded fortunately, which <hi>Iacobus</hi> having had his education and breeding and credit too from him, afterwards took the ſtate from him. Of this ſort was that of <hi>Coppola</hi> in our dayes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of Arragon, which <hi>Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pola</hi> having attained to that greatneſs, that he thought he wanted nothing but the Kingdom, meaning not to go without, loſt his life. And indeed if any conſpiracie againſt Princes made by great men be ever like to take effect, this was very probable, being made by one that
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:30490:194"/>
might have been termed a King for his power and conveniencies he had to work his will. But that greedy ambition which blinds them in their deſire to rule, blinds them as well in the mannaging of this enterpriſe: for if they know how to act this villany with diſcretion, it were impoſſible but it ſhould ſucceed. A Prince then that would be well wary of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies, ſhould be more jealous of thoſe to whom he hath afforded moſt favours, then of thoſe to whom he hath done moſt wrongs: for theſe want the means, and thoſe have them at pleaſure, and the will is a like; for the deſire of rule is as great or greater then that of revenge. Wherefore they are to confer but ſo much authority upon their favourites, that ſtill between it and the Principality they keep a diſtance, and leave (as it were) ſome obſtacle in their way; otherwiſe ſeldome falls it out but that it chances to them, as to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Princes. But let us return to our order. I ſay, that being they are to be great men that plot theſe treaſons, and have eaſie acceſs unto the Prince, we are to diſcourſe upon the ſucceſſes of theſe their undertakings, what they have been, and point at the reaſon that hath caus'd them to prove happy or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy. And (as I formerly ſaid) at three ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall times, herein are dangers found. In the plotting, in the acting, and after. Therefore are there very few that prove lucky: for it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt impoſſible to paſs all theſe happily. And beginning to treate touching the dangers of the the firſt, that are of moſt importance, I ſay, there had need be much circumſpection and adviſement, which likewiſe had need be ſeconded by good fortune, that in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:30490:195"/>
and ordering of a conſpiracy, it be not diſcloſed; for that is done either by rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or by conjecture. This relation proceeds from the ſmall faith; or ſmall diſcretion of thoſe men with whom thou communicateſt thy ſecret. And it is a thing ordinary to find but ſmall ſaith; for thou canſt not communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate it but to thy confidents, who for love of thee may adventure death, or to men that are diſcontented with the Prince. Of confidents, poſſible it is that one or two may be found; but when thou openeſt thy ſelf to more; it is impoſſible thou ſhouldeſt find them. Beſides the good will they beare thee, had need be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great, to the end they be not affrighted at the puniſhment and peril they incurre. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over men are often deceived touching the love, which thou beleeveſt another bears thee, nor canſt thou ever aſſure thy ſelf of it, unleſs thou haſt had experience thereof; and to make proof of it herein is exceeding dangerous; and though thou haſt had proof thereof in ſome other dangerous exploit, where they have ſtuck cloſe upon thee, yet canſt thou not from thence meaſure them for this, being this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſurpaſſes all others. If thou meaſureſt their faith by their diſcontent againſt their Prince, therein thou mayeſt eaſily deceive thy ſelf: For ſo ſoon as thou haſt revealed thy mind to that malecontent, thou giveſt him a ſubject where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon to work again his own content; and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his hatred had need be great, or thy power with him of much force to keep him faithful. Hereupon it ariſes, that very many of them are diſcover'd &amp; cruſh'd even in the egge; and when one of them among many men hath bin kept ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret any time, it hath bin thought of as a miracle
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:30490:195"/>
as was that of <hi>Piſo</hi> againſt <hi>Nero,</hi> &amp; in our daies that of <hi>Laurence</hi> and <hi>Iulian</hi> of Medici, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto above fifty perſons were made privy, who met together all to diſcover themſelves in the execution thereof. As for the diſcovery for want of diſcretion, that falls out when a conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor is not wary in his talk, ſo that a ſervant or another third perſon comes take notice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as it befe <hi>Brutus</hi> his ſonnes, who in contriving the buſineſs with <hi>Tarquins</hi> Ambaſſadors, were underſtood by a ſlave who accuſed them: or elſe through a certain lightneſs of thine own, thou communicateſt it to a woman, or a child which thou loveſt, or ſome ſuch ſlight perſon, as <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> did, one of thoſe that conſpir'd with <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotas</hi> againſt <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, who told the treaſon to <hi>Nicomacus,</hi> a child which he lov'd, who preſently told it to <hi>Ciballinus</hi> his brother, and <hi>Ciballinus</hi> to the King. Touching diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry by conjecture, we have an example for it, where <hi>Piſo</hi> conſpired againſt <hi>Nero,</hi> at which time <hi>Sceuinus</hi> one of the conſpirators, the day before that he was to ſlay <hi>Nero,</hi> made his will, and gave order that <hi>Milichius</hi> his free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhould cauſe his old and ruſty dagger to be ſcoured; he made all his ſlaves free, and gave them money; he appointed many clouts to bind up wounds to be prepared; by which conjectures <hi>Milichius</hi> being aſſured of the buſineſs, accuſed, him before <hi>Nero. Scevinus</hi> was taken, and with him <hi>Natalis</hi> one of the Conſpirators, who had bin ſeen the day before to talk a good while and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately in his company, who not agreeing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the diſcourſe they held, were forc'd to confeſs the truth. So that the treaſon was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wraied, and the conſpirators utterly ruin'd.
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:30490:196"/>
From theſe occaſions of diſcovery it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to beware, but that through malice, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcretion, or fondneſs all comes to light, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the complotters thereof paſs the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of three or four; and in caſe that more then one of them chance to be taken, it is impoſſible but that it muſt be ſo; for two cannot be ſo well agreed of all their diſcourſes together, but that in ſome things they ſhall jarre. When one alone that is reſolute, is laid hold on, he may through the ſtrength of his courage, be able to conceal the reſt of his complices: but then muſt his conſors ſhew no leſs reſolution than he, in ſtanding firm and not diſcovering themſelves by flight: for on which ſide ſoever courage failes, either on his that is taken, or his that is at liberty, the conſpiracy is diſcloſd. And the example alleadgd by <hi>T. Livius,</hi> is very rare in the treaſon that was plotted againſt <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r lamus</hi> King of <hi>Siracuſa,</hi> where <hi>Theodorus</hi> one of the conſpirators being taken, with a ſtout courage conceald all his companions, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed the Kings friends; and on the other part, all the confederates were confident of <hi>Theodorus</hi> his reſolution, that not one of them forſook <hi>Siracuſa,</hi> or made any ſhew of fear, Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all theſe dangers are to be paſſed in the ordering of a conſpiracy, before the acting of it. Againſt which theſe are the remedies; The firſt and trueſt whereof, or better to term it, the only one is, not to give leiſure to our complices to accuſe us, nor communicate the matter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, till juſt when thou meaneſt to put it in execution, and not before. They who have thus done, aſſuredly eſcape the dangers belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the practiſe thereof; and oftentimes the others alſo, or rather have they all had good
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:30490:196"/>
ſucceſs: and I think every one that is wiſe ſhould endeavor to carry the matter thus. I will content my ſelf to produce only two examples. <hi>Nelematus</hi> not being able to indure the tyranny of <hi>Ariſtorimus,</hi> Tyrant of <hi>Epirus,</hi> aſſembled together in his houſe many of his friends and kinsfolke, and having encourag'd them to ſet their Country at liberty, ſome of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd time to be adviſed and prepared: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Nelematus</hi> cauſd his ſervants to ſhut the doors, and told thoſe he had cald together, That they ſhould either ſwear preſently to do this, or if not, he would deliver them all priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to <hi>Ariſtotimus:</hi> whereby all of them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mov'd, ſwore, and ſo without more delay, went and put in execution what <hi>Nelematus</hi> had orderd. One of the <hi>Magi</hi> having by treachery ſeiſd upon the kingdom of <hi>Perſia, Orthanus</hi> a great man had notice thereof, and found out the deceit, and thereupon conferd with ſix other Princes of that State, ſaying, he was now underraking to vindicate the Kingdom from the Tyranny of that Magician; and when ſome of them demanded time, <hi>Darius</hi> roſe up (one of the ſix that was cald by <hi>Orthanus)</hi> and ſaid, Either wee will all now go and execute this, or elſe I will go and accuſe you all: ſo riſing all by conſent, and not giving any one time to repent himſelf, they happily effected what they deſir'd. Like unto theſe two examples alſo, is the courſe the <hi>Aetolians</hi> took to put <hi>Nabis</hi> the <hi>Spartan</hi> Tyrant to death, who ſent <hi>Aleſſamenes</hi> a Citizen of theirs with 300 horſe and 1000 foot to <hi>Nabis,</hi> under colour of giving him ayd: the ſecret they communicated to <hi>Aleſſamenes</hi> only; the others that were with him they charged to obey him in whatſoever matter it
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:30490:197"/>
were, under pain of baniſhment. This man went into Sparta, never communicating his Commiſſion to any, till juſt he was to put it in execution, whereupon it fell out that he ſlew him. They then by theſe means eſcap'd the dangers that accompany the plotting and ordering of Conſpiracies; and whoever ſhall do as they did, ſhall alwaies be ſure to eſcape them: And that every one alſo is able ſo to do, I will ſhew by the example of <hi>Piſo</hi> alledged before. <hi>Piſo</hi> was a very great man, and of much eſteem, and very familiar with <hi>Nero,</hi> on whom we much rely'd: And <hi>Nero</hi> went often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to banquet with him in his gardens: <hi>Piſo</hi> therefore might have procur'd himſelf friends of ſpirit and courage, and willing too to put ſuch a thing in execution, being a matter eaſie for any great man to compaſs; and when he had had <hi>Nero</hi> in his gardens, then commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated the buſineſs to them, and with fit words perſwaded them to it, ſo that they could not have had time to refuſe, and impoſſible had it bin, but that it muſt have taken effect. And if we ſhall examine all the others we have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiond, we ſhall find very few could have bin o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe carried. But men that ordinarily do not well weigh the actions of the world, often commit very great errors, and the greater in thoſe actions, that have ſomething of extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in them, as this. The matter then is never to be communicated, but upon neceſſity, or even at the very acting of it, and yet if thou wilt communicate it, let that be but unto one of whom thou haſt had long experience, or that therein is intereſted upon the ſame reaſons thou art. It is eaſier to find one man of that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than many, and thereby alſo is leſs danger.
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:30490:197"/>
Moreover, when he ſhould deceive thee, there were ſome means left yet to deſend thee, which could not be where the conſpirators are many: for it is the ſaying of a wiſe man, that with one alone a man may ſpeak any thing for one man; I, is as good as another mans No, provided that nothing be given by thee under thine own hand-writing. And of writing any thing a man ſhouldbe as wary as of a perilous rock; for nothing convicts thee ſooner than thine own hand. <hi>Plautianus</hi> having a mind to skill <hi>Severus</hi> the Emperor, <hi>Antonius</hi> his ſon, committed the execution of it to <hi>Saturninus</hi> a Tribune: who purpoſing to accuſe and not obey him, yet doubting when he ſhould come to the tryal, <hi>Plautianus</hi> would be beleev'd before him, asked him a note under his hand, that might give him aſſurance of his Commiſſion; which <hi>Plautianus,</hi> blinded with ambition, gave him, whereupon it follow'd, that he was accus'd and convicted by the Tribune, without which, and certain other tokens, <hi>Plautianus</hi> had carried it clear againſt him, ſo boldly he deny'd it. Therefore when one only accuſes, there may be ſome remedy, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in caſe thou beeſt not convicted by any writing of thiue, or countermarks, whereof a man ſhould be well aware. In <hi>Piſoes</hi> conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie there was a woman called <hi>Epicaris,</hi> which formerly had bin one of <hi>Neroes</hi> Miſtreſſes, who thinking it would ſerve well to purpoſe to joyn with the conſpirators, one that was a Captain of ſome galleys, which <hi>Nero</hi> kept for his ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard, opened to him the conſpiracie, but not who were the conſpirators, whereupon that Captain contrary to his word given, accus'd her before <hi>Nero;</hi> but ſuch was her boldneſs in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying it, that <hi>Nero was</hi> aſtoniſh'd thereat, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:30490:198"/>
her not. There are then in communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating the matter to one alone two dangers; the one that the party go not voluntarily to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe thee, alledging ſome proof againſt thee; the other that he detect thee not conſtraind and forc't thereunto by torture, having been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended upon ſome conjecture or ſuſpition had of him: but in either of theſe two dangers there is ſome remedy, being that in the one it may be deny'd, by ſaying the party did it out of hatred he bore thee; and in the other, by alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the extremity of torture compell'd him to utter any thing, though falſe. It is wiſdome then to make no man privy to ſuch a ſecret, but rather to order it conformably to the above alledged examples; or in caſe thou revealſt it, not to exceed one, where though there be ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more danger, yet is there much leſs than when it is diſcoverd to divers. Near unto this courſe is, when a neceſſity conſtrains thee to do that to the Prince, which thou ſeeſt he would do unto thee, which neceſſity is ſo exceſſive, that it gives thee leiſure only to provide for thy ſecurity. This neceſſity brings the buſineſs or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily to a good end; and to prove it, two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples ſhall ſuffice mee. <hi>Cammodus</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror did uſe <hi>Lettus</hi> and <hi>Elettus,</hi> Captains of his guard, among his familiar and principal friends, and <hi>Martia</hi> among his chief Concubines and Miſtreſſes: but becauſe ſometime he had been reprehended by them for ſome things done, whereby he had diſgrac'd his perſon and the Empire, he reſolve'd to put them to death, and writ in a liſt the names of <hi>Martia, Lettus,</hi> and <hi>Eletius,</hi> and ſome others, who the night following he meant ſhould die, and ſo put that liſt under his pillow; and when
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:30490:198"/>
he went to riſe, a little boy which he lov'd, playing about his chamber and his bed, found that liſt, and going out with it in his hand met with <hi>Martia,</hi> who took it from him, and read it, and having ſeen the contents thereof, ſent for <hi>Lettus</hi> and <hi>Elettus,</hi> whereupon they three knowing the danger they were in, reſolv'd to prevent it, and ſo without longer delay the night following ſlew <hi>Commodus.

by them, or at leaſt to be put out of doubt of them, that they be not reducd to ſuch terms, as to think they muſt of force either kill or be kild: Touching the dangers that are incurrd upon the execution, they ariſe either from changing the order given, or from want of courage in the actor, or from ſome error the actor commits for want of judgement, or from the fayle of fully perfecting the matter in hand by leaving ſome of thoſe ſurviving who were appointed for death. I think therefore that nothing ſo much diſturbs or hinders mens actions, as at an inſtant without reſpite of time, to be compeld to alter an order once given, or divert the courſe of it a different way from that it was firſt intended And if this variation cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes diſorder in any thing, it is in the actions of warr, and ſuch like matters, whereof we now ſpeak: for in ſuch occaſions, there is nothing ſo neceſſary for men to do, as to reſolve with themſelves to execute fully all that is look'd for at their hands. And if men have a good while bent their minds to one courſe or order, and that chance ſuddenly to be alterd, it muſt needs breed ſome diſturbance to them all, and ruine the whole deſign, ſo that it is much better for them to execute any thing according to the order firſt given (however that ſome inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient enſue thereupon) then, by deſiring to cancell that, to enter into a thouſand inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences. This happens when they have not time to put themſelves in order again: for when a man hath leiſure, he may go his own way he likes beſt.

It ſo fell out, that the <hi>Pazzi</hi> and the <hi>Medici</hi> together with the Cardinal being in the Cathedral Church of <hi>Florence</hi> at Maſſe, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice was given that <hi>Julian</hi> would not dine there that day, which cauſed the Conſpirators to conſult together, and what they were to have done in the houſe to thoſe of <hi>Medici,</hi> they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to do in the Church, which gave diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance to the whole order: for <hi>John Baptiſta de Monte ſacro,</hi> would not be guilty of murder committed in the Church, inſomuch as they were forc't to change the actors in every part, who having not time to ſettle &amp; confirm their reſolutions, committed ſuch errors, that in the very execution thereof they were all ruin'd. Courage ſayles him that is to execute any thing, either through reverence of the perſon he is to do the miſchief upon, or through the executioners own innate cowardiſe. Such is the Majeſty and reverence which the preſence of a Prince carries along with it, that it is an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary thing for it, either to mitigate or toaffright an executioner. A Slave was ſent to <hi>Marius,</hi> when he was taken priſoner by the Minturve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, to kill him, who amaz'd at the preſence of the man, and at the remembrance of his name prov'd ſo cowardly, that he loſt all power to ſlay him. And if there be ſuch power in the perſon of a man that is bound, and in priſon, and in a manner choak'd up with ill fortune, how much more may we think there is in a Prince

There were ſome conſpir'd againſt <hi>Sitalces</hi> King of <hi>Thrace,</hi> and they appointed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them a day for the execution, and met at the place agreed on where the Prince was, but none of them once mov'd to hurt him, ſo that they parted all thence without attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing, and without knowing what it was that hinder'd them, but blaming one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother for the fayle: into ſuch errors they often fall afterwards, in ſo much as the treaſon was diſcover'd, and they ſuffer'd puniſhment for that evill, which they could, but durſt not act.

This negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence could not proceed from elſewhere then from that of neceſſity the Princes preſence did affright them, or that ſome courteſie he ſhew'd them humbled them. In ſuch executions an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient or error many times ariſes, either for lack of diſcretion or courage: for when the one or other of theſe two once amazes thee, thou art borne forward in ſuch confuſion of thy underſtanding, that it makes thee both ſay and do what thou oughtſt not. And that men are thus aſtoniſhed and confounded, <hi>Livie</hi> does

                        <hi>the conſideration of ſo weighty a matter had ſomewhat diſorderd</hi> For it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, that any man (though of a reſolute courage, &amp; accuſtomed to the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of men, and uſe of his weapons) ſhould not be quite aſtoniſhed. Therefore choice is to be made of men experienced in ſuch matters, nor ſhould one commit them to any other, however he be eſteem'd very couragious: for let no man that hath not formerly made tryall of himſelf, preſume too much upon his courage in the performance of any great exploit. This amazement then may either cauſe thee to let thy weapons fall out of thy hands, or ſuch words from thy month, as may work the ſame effect. <hi>Luciila Commodus</hi> his ſiſter had ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd it, that <hi>Quintianus</hi> ſhould kill him. And he awaited <hi>Cowmodus</hi> in the paſſage into the Theater, where with a naked poinard com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming up to him, he cryed out, This the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſends thee; which words caus'd him to be firſt laid hold on, before hee could bring down his arme to ſtrike him. <hi>M. Antonius</hi> of <hi>Volterra</hi> appointed (as wee ſaid before) to kill <hi>Laurence</hi> of <hi>Medici,</hi> as hee came near him, ſaid, Ah Traitor! which ſaying of his oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned the ſafety of <hi>Laurence,</hi> and the wrack of that Conſpiracy. Such a matter may be fully perfected, when it is practiſed only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt one head, for the reaſons alledged: but
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:30490:201"/>
very hardly can it well be accompliſhed againſt two principals, or rather impoſſibly: for it is impoſſible that one and the like action ſhould ſucceed at the ſame inſtant in ſeveral places: for it cannot be, but whither a man will or no, the one ſhall ruine the other, being done at ſeveral times. So that if it be a thing very hazardous and full of danger and ſmall adviſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to practiſe againſt the perſon of one Prince alone; certainly to conſpire againſt two, is wholly vain and to no purpoſe. And were it not for the reverence I bear to the Hiſtorian, I would never beleeve, that were poſſible, which <hi>Herodian</hi> ſays of <hi>Plautianus,</hi> that he gave the charge to <hi>Saturninus</hi> the Centurion to kill <hi>Severus</hi> and <hi>Antoninus</hi> abiding in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall place; for it diſſents ſo much from reaſon, that nothing elſe but this authority would make me credit it. Certain young men of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> conſpir'd together againſt <hi>Diocles</hi> and <hi>Hippias</hi> Tyrants of that City, and ſlew <hi>Diocles;</hi> but <hi>Hippias</hi> that remaind, revenged it. <hi>Chiones</hi> and <hi>Leonides, Heracleans,</hi> that were <hi>Platoes</hi> Diſciples, conſpird againſt <hi>Clearchus</hi> and <hi>Satirus</hi> that were Tyrants; they ſlew <hi>Clearchus,</hi> and <hi>Satirus</hi> that was left alive puniſhed the fact. And the <hi>Pazzi,</hi> ſeveral times alledged by us, has not the fortune to kill but <hi>Iulian</hi> alone. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch as every one ſhould be ſo wiſe as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to conſpire againſt ſeveral principals: for he neither advantageth himſelf, nor his Country, nor any body elſe: but rather they that are left behind, become more intolerable and fiercer, as <hi>Florence, Athens,</hi> and <hi>Heraclea,</hi> which I ſpoke of before, know well It is true, that the conſpiracy which <hi>Pelopidas</hi> practiſed to free <hi>Thebes</hi> his native Country, had all
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:30490:201"/>
manner of difficulties, yet it ſucceeded lucki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: for <hi>Pelopidas</hi> conſpired not only againſt two Tyrants, but againſt ten: and not only was he not a confident of any of theirs, and ſo had no eaſie acceſs unto any of thoſe Tyrants, but he was a rebell: yet for all this came he into <hi>Thebes,</hi> ſlew the Tyrants and ſet the Country at liberty. Nevertheleſs he affected all this with the aſſiſtance of one <hi>Carion</hi> a Counſellor belonging to thoſe Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, by whoſe means he had eaſie acceſs to execute his purpoſe. Yet let none take exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from him: for it was an enterpriſe almoſt impoſſible, and a miracle it was that it ſucceeded; and ſo it was, and is now eſteemed by thoſe writers that celebrate the memory thereof, as a matter of great rarity, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out patterne.

For which accidents (becauſe they are very rare) we cannot find any remedy, it is very neceſſary to examin well thoſe that may chance, and help
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:30490:202"/>
them as we can. It remaines now only, that we diſcourſe of the dangers which they run after the execution done, which are all but one, and this it is, when any one is left alive to revenge the dead Prince. There may then his brothers or his ſons be left, or other of his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes to whom the Principality may belong, &amp; may be left alive by thy negligence, or upon ſome occaſions (formerly ſpoken of) that may execute this revenge, as it befell <hi>John Andreas</hi> of <hi>Lampognano,</hi> who together with his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plotters having ſlain the Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> and there being left alive one ſon of his and two brothers, they were ready at hand time enough to revenge his death. And truly in this caſe theſe conſpirators are excuſable: becauſe they have here no remedy, but when any of them ſurvives, for lack of good adviſement, or through their negligence, then indeed thereis no excuſe to be made for them. Some conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors at <hi>Forly</hi> ſlew Count <hi>Ierolamus</hi> their Lord, took priſoners his wife and ſons, which were but little ones; and thinking they could have no ſecurity, unleſs they became maſters of the fortreſs, which the governour was not willing to give into their hands; whereupon the Lady <hi>Katherine</hi> (for ſo the Counteſs was called) promiſed the Traitors, that if they would let her enter therein, ſhe would cauſe it to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered up to them, and that they ſhould keep her ſons for pledges. They upon her word thus given, ſuffered her to enter in, who ſo ſoon as ſhee was within the walls, reproached them with the murder of her husband, and threatned them with all manner of revenge; &amp; to let them know ſhee had no regard of her children, ſhe ſhewed them her privy parts, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:30490:203"/>
ſhe had the means left her to bring forth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſo that they not knowing what to do, and too late perceiving their own error, ſuffered perpetual exile in puniſhment of their lack of wit. But of all dangers that can befall after the execution, there is node mone certain, nor more terrible, then when the people is a friend to that Prince thou haſt ſlain: for againſt this the conſpirators can have no remedy: for they can never ſecure themſelves. We have <hi>Caeſar</hi> for example hereof, who becauſe he had the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Rome to friend, was by their means revenged: for when they had chaſed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators from Rome they cauſed all of them in ſeveral places to be ſlain. Treaſons that are practiſed againſt ones own Countrey, are leſs dangerous for thoſe that work them, then thoſe that are practiſed agaiſt Princes: for in the ordering of them the dangers are leſs then in the others, and in executing of them they are the ſame, and after the execution there is none at all. In the plotting and working them the dangers are not many: for a Citizen may frame himſelf ſo, as to be capable of power, without manifeſting his mind therein or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to any one; and unleſs thoſe his purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes receive ſome interruption, he may happily proceed in his deſign: but if any law made, chance to croſs them, he muſt ſtay his time, and ſeek ſome other courſe. This is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of a Republique where in corruption is entred in ſome part; for in one not corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (no evil beginning taking <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="371" facs="tcp:30490:203"/>

                        </gap>h refore are leſs wary as alſo becauſe they carry more reſpect towards their principal citizens, and therefore are they the more auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and more inſolent to practiſe againſt them. Few there are but have read <hi>Catalines</hi> conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy written by <hi>Saluſt,</hi> &amp; know how that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards when it was diſcovered, <hi>Cataline,</hi> did not only abide in <hi>Rome,</hi> but came into the Senate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, &amp; ſpoke in villanous termes againſt the Senate and the Conſul; ſo great was the reſpect that that City bore to her Citizens ſo that when he was departed from <hi>Rome,</hi> and had his Armies already on foot, <hi>Lentulus</hi> nor thoſe others had never been layd hold on, had not there been letters of his own hand brought againſt him, which manifeſtly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed him. <hi>Hanno</hi> the moſt potent Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen in <hi>Carthage,</hi> aſpiring to a Tyranny, had provided at the marriage of one of his own daughters to poiſon all the Senate, and afterwards make himſelf Prince. When this matter was known, the Senate took no other order then to make a law which limited the exceſs of expences anbanquets and weddings; ſuch was the reſpect they bore to men of their qualities. It is very true that in the executing of a treaſon againſt ones native Country, there is more difficulty, and greater dangers; for very ſeldome is it, that thy own forces ſuffice, being to conſpire againſt ſo many; for every one hath not an Army at his command, as <hi>Ceſar Agathocles</hi> or <hi>Cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="372" facs="tcp:30490:204"/>
not ſuch advantages of forces, muſt do it either with ſome ſlight or artifice, or by the aide of forraine forces. As for ſlights and tricks, <hi>Piſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratus</hi> the <hi>Athenian</hi> having over come the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garenſes,</hi> and thereby got credit with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, one morning came out among them woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, ſaying, The nobility through envy had thus wrong'd him, and ask'd leave of them for his defence to have a guard of armd men about him. By this power he eaſily attain'd to ſuch greatneſs, that he brought <hi>Athens</hi> under his Tyranny. <hi>Pandulfus Petrucci</hi> return'd himſelf with others that were out-law'd into <hi>Siena,</hi> &amp; there he had the charge given him over the common guard of Juſtice, as a Mecanick office, and which others refus'd, yet in time thoſe arm'd men gave him ſuch reputation, that ſhortly after he became Lord of the Town. Many others have uſed other endeavors, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther waies, and in a ſhort ſpace, and without danger have attained to the ſame. Thoſe that by their own force, or by help of forrain-forces have conſpir'd to make themſelves Lords over their native Countries, have had ſeveral ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, as fortune hath befriended them or otherwiſe. <hi>Cataline</hi> we ſpoke of before, was ruined thereby. <hi>Hanno</hi> (of whom we formerly made mention) when the poiſon took not effect, armed many thouſands of his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſans, who with himſelf were all ſlain. Some of the prime Citizens of <hi>Thebes,</hi> to the end they might become Lords of the Town, called to their aid a <hi>Sparian</hi> army, and ſo took upon them the rule of that City. So that when we ſhall have examined all the conſpiracies made againſt a Country, we ſhall not find any, at leaſt very few, that in the plotting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:30490:204"/>
have been ſuppreſſed, but all of them either have taken effect, or bin ruined in the execution rather. When they are once acted, they carry not with them any further dangers, then the nature of a Principality hath in it ſelf: for when a man hath once gotten to be a Tyrant, he hath his own proper and ordinary dangers belonging to him, againſt which there are no other remedies then thoſe we have formerly touch'd. This is that which I had to write touching conſpiracies: and if I have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd of thoſe onely that are executed with the ſword, and not done by poiſon, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have all the ſame rule. It is rue, that thoſe done with poiſon, are the more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, becauſe they are more uncertain, for that a man cannot adminiſter by every one, and he muſt needs reveal it to him that he makes his inſtrument; and from this neceſſity of revealing it, ariſes thy danger: moreover upon many accidents a draught of poiſon can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prove deadly, as it befell thoſe that ſlew <hi>Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Whereupon I judge that Princes have not a greater enemy then treaſon; becauſe when a treaſon is once practiſed againſt them, it ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther brings them to their end, or procures them much infamy; for if it ſucceeds, they die; if it be diſcovered, and they ſlay the traitors, men always ſuppoſe it hath been ſome device of that Princes, to vent his ava<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

conſpiracy is once diſcloſed to them, before they go about to revenge it, but firſt to pty narrowly into it, and to ſeek to underſtand well the qualities thereof, and weigh well the conditions of the conſpirators, and their own; and when they finde them great and mighty, never to diſcover them, till they be furniſhed with ſufficient forces to cruſh them; for in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing otherwiſe, they ſhould diſcover it to their own ruin: Wherefore they ought to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble it with all poſſible care; becauſe the conſpirators, when they finde themſelves diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, of force are driven to act what they can without reſpect. We have an example here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of from the Romanes, who having lift two le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of ſouldiers to guard the Capuans againſt the Samnitcs, as otherwhere we have ſaid, the heads of thoſe Legions conſpired together to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the Capuans: Whereof notice being given at Rome, the matter was committed to <hi>Rutilius</hi> the new Conſul, that he ſhould take order for it, who to lull aſleep the conſpirators, gave it out, that the Senate had again confirmed the Capuan Legions aboad there: Which thoſe ſoldiers giving credit to, and thinking they had time enough to execute their purpoſe, they never went about to haſten the matter: And ſo they ſtood ſtill, till they began to ſee that the Conſul ſeparated them one from another, which thing having begotten ſuſpicion in them, made them diſcover themſelves, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute their deſign. Nor can there be a fuller example on the one or the other part: for hereby it appears how ſlow men are in matters, where they think they have time enough; and how quick, when a neceſſity drives them to it. Nor can a Prince or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:30490:205"/>
(that would defer the diſcovery of a treaſon for his own advantage) take a better courſe, then by ſome device or trick offer the conſpirators ſhortly ſome handſome oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, to the end that they attending that, or thinking they have time enough, may give lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to that Prince or Commonwealth to puniſh them. They who have done otherwiſe, have haſtened their own deſtruction, as the Duke of Athens did, and <hi>William</hi> of the family of the <hi>Pazzi.</hi> The Duke being become the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of Florence, and underſtanding that there was a conſpiracy plotted againſt him, cauſed without further examining the matter, one of the conſpirators to be laid hold on, which gave and alarme to the reſt, whereupon arming themſelves, they took the ſtate from him. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> being a Commiſſary in the valley of Chiana in the year 1501. having had notice, that in Arezzo there was a conſpiracy in favour of the Vitelli, to take that Town from the Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines, preſently went to the town, and not conſidering his own forces, nor the conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, nor taking order to furniſh himſelf with any, by the Biſhops advice, who was his ſons, cauſed one of the conſpirators to be laid hands on, whereupon the firſt preſently took arms, got away the town from the Florentines, and <hi>William</hi> of a Commiſſary was made a priſoner. But when thoſe conſpiracies are feeble, they may and ought without any regard be ſuppreſſed. Yet in any caſe we muſt not follow two courſes which have been uſed in a maner contrary one to the other: The one by the forenamed Duke of <hi>Athens,</hi> who to ſhew he believed that he had the citizens of <hi>Florence</hi> good wills, put one to death that detected a conſpiracy againſt him:
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:30490:206"/>
The other by <hi>Dion</hi> a Siracuſan, who to ſound the minde of one whom he had in ſuſpicion, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed that <hi>Callippus,</hi> of whom he was very confident, ſhould make him believe that he were working a plot againſt him; but theſe matters fell out ill for them both. For the one took all courage away from the accuſers, and encouraged traitors; the other made the way eaſie to his own ruine, or rather he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was principal of the conſpiracy againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſo it fell out; for <hi>Callippus</hi> (being that he could without any reſpect practiſe ſuch a thing againſt <hi>Dion)</hi> did it ſo in earneſt, that he took both his life and his State from him.</p>

Which depends hereupon; for that State that is changed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins firſt either by violence, or without it: and when it begins with violence, it muſt needs
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:30490:206"/>
begin with doing wrong to many; and it is neceſſary afterwards that in its deſtruction, they who have been wronged, revenge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſo from their deſire of revenge pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the effuſion of blood and death of many. But when that State is begun by the common conſent of an univerſality, and thereby hath been amplify'd, it hath no cauſe afterwards, when that univerſality is ruined, to wrong o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers then the head onely; and of this kinde was the State of Rome, and the <hi>Tarquins</hi> ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, as alſo was in Florence the State which the <hi>Medici</hi> held, when afterwards in their deſtructions in the year 1444. none elſe were hurt but they.

                        </gap>yed by the Fathers, and ſo much ſuſpected, that when hh ſpoke to the people and offered to give them thoſe moneys, which the Corn was ſold for, that the Publique had cauſed to be brought from Sicily, they wholly refuſed them, thinking that <hi>Spurius</hi> meant to give them the price of their liberty. But had that people been already corrupted, they would not have refuſed the ſaid price, but rather have opened him that way to the tyranny, which now they ſhut againſt him. A fuller example hereof <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Capitolinus</hi> repreſents unto us; for in him we ſee, what excellencies of mind and body, how many brave exploits acted in defence of a mans native Country, a brutiſh deſire of rule quite raſes out: which (as it appeared) grew in him, through the envy he bore <hi>Camillus</hi> for the honors were done him, whereby his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding was ſo blinded, as not conſidering the manner of Government uſed in the City, nor examining, whereupon he was to work, unapt as yet to receive ſo evil a form, betook himſelf to raiſe tumults in Rome againſt the Senate, and contrary to the Laws of his Country. Wherein the perfection of that City is very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and the goodneſs of the matter thereof; for in his caſe none of the Nobility, however that they were very eager defenders the one of another, never ſtirred in his favour, nor any of his kindred undertook any thing in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence: whereas ordinarily when others were accuſed, they uſed to accompany them in a rueful manner, clad in black, and all ſorrowful;
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:30490:207"/>
whereby they might gain compaſſion in favor of the defendant, and with <hi>Manlius</hi> none of theſe were ſeen. The Tribunas of the people, who were wont to favour thoſe things, which ſeemed to be mov'd for the peoples advantage, and the more they were againſt the Nobility, ſo much the forwarder uſed to thruſt them, in this caſe held with the Nobility to ſuppreſs a common miſchief. The people of Rome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly deſirous of their own advantage, and a great favourer of any thing that thwart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Nobility, however they afforded <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> many favors, nevertheleſs, when the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes cited him, and referred his cauſe to be judged by the people, that people being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come judge of a defendant, without regard condemned him to death. Wherefore <hi>I</hi> believe there is not any example in this Hiſtory more proper to ſhew the goodneſs of that Common-wealths orders, then this, ſeeing that not one of this whole City moved in behalf of a very valourous Citizen, who as well publikely as privately had done many worthy acts: becauſe in all of them the love of their country was of more force than any other regard, and they conſidered more the preſent danger; that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on him, than his fore-paſt deſerts, ſo that by his death they ſet themſelves at liberty. And <hi>T. Livius</hi> ſays, <hi>This end had that man, who had he not been born in a</hi>

                        <hi>free State, was worthy of admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Where two things are to be conſidered; the one, that by other means a man ought to ſeek after glory in a City corrupted, than in one that lives ſtrictly according to the civil go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; the other is (wich is almoſt the
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:30490:208"/>
ſame with the firſt) that men in their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and the rather in actions of conſequence ſhould conſider the times, and conforme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves thereunto: and thoſe that by their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill choice, or natural inclination diſagree with the times, moſt commonly live unhappily, and their actions have but ill ſucceſſes. The contrary befalls thoſe that can accord with the times: and without queſtion, by the Hiſtorians words which we for merly mentioned, we may make this concluſion, that if <hi>Manlius</hi> had been borne in the times that <hi>Marius</hi> and <hi>Silla</hi> were, where the matter was already corrupted, that his ambition could have made ſome impreſſion therein, he might, have workd the ſame effect, and had the ſame ſucceſs that <hi>Silla</hi> and <hi>Marius</hi> had, and others afterwards, who after them aſpird to the Tyranny. So in like manner, if <hi>Silla</hi> and <hi>Marius</hi> had liv'd in <hi>Manlius</hi> his daies. they had been cruſhd in the very egge: for one man may indeed begin with his evill cour<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſes and miſchievous waies to debauch the people of a City: but it is impoſſible that one mans life can ſuffice to corrupt it ſo, that he himſelf can make any advantage thereof. And in caſe it were poſſible, that in tract of time, he could do it, yet would it be impoſſible, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the manner of mens proceedings, who are impatient, and cannot defer any paſſion of theirs long. Moreover, they erre in their affairs, and in thoſe eſpecially which they much deſire, in ſo much as either through their ſmall pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or through their error, they would venture upon the executing of their purpoſes, in counter time, and ſo come to an evill end. Therefore is it neceſſary, if a man would gain authority in a Republick, and induce ſome ill

for me thereinto, to find the matter already diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderd by time, and that by little and little, and from age to age is brought into diſorder, which of force comes thereunto, when it is not (as formerly hath been ſaid) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhd by vertuous examples, or by new <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </argument>
                     <p>I Have many times conſider'd, how the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of mens good or evill fortunes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the manner of the encounter of their proceedings with the times: for it is evident, that ſome men proceed in their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires with violence, others with regard and warineſs. And becauſe that in the one and
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:30490:210"/>
other of theſe two ways, the convenient terms are tranſgreſſed, being that they cannot hit upon the true way; both in the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they fail. But he fails leaſt, and oftneſt lights upon good ſucceſs, that meets (as I have ſaid) time in its own way, and always proceeds ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as his own nature puts him forward. Every one knows how <hi>Fabius Maximus</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded with his Army carefully and warily, far from all that kind of metle and confidence which other whiles the Romans uſed; and his good fortune would have it, that this his way agreed well with the times: for <hi>Hannibal</hi> being come a young man into Italy, and with a freſh gale of fortune, and having twice broken the Romane Armies, and that Republike almoſt loſt all her good ſoldiers, and therefore being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted, could not light upon better fortune than to have ſuch a Captain, who by his ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and warineſs ſhould keep the enemy in play with vain delaies: Nor could <hi>Fabius</hi> have met with times fitter for his ways: whereupon came it to paſs that he grew glorious. And that <hi>Fabius</hi> did this upon the inſtigation of his own nature, and not upon a meer choice, we ſee that when <hi>Scipio</hi> deſired to paſs over into Affrica with thoſe Armies, whereby to make an end of the war, <hi>Fabius</hi> much contradicted it, as he that could not go out of his own pace, nor leave his own cuſtome, ſo that for all him, <hi>Hannibal</hi> might have continued ſtill in Italy; for he perceived not, that the times were changed, and it was needful to alter the manner of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing war. And had <hi>Fabius</hi> been King of Rome, he might eaſily have ſpoiled that war, becauſe he would not have known how to alter his proceedings with the alteration of
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:30490:210"/>
times. But being he was born in a Republike, where there was divers Citizens, and divers humors, as ſhe had <hi>Fabius,</hi> who was excellent in thoſe times, when the war was onely to be ſupported; ſo had ſhe <hi>Scipio</hi> in the times when their enemies were to be overcome. Whence ariſes it, that a Republike hath a longer life, and longer enjoys good fortune than a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality: becauſe ſhe can better fit her ſelf for ſeveral accidents, by reaſon of the variety of her Subjects that are in her, then can a Prince: for a man that is accuſtomed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in one manner, never alters, as it is ſaid, and muſt of neceſſity, when the times diſagree with his way, go to wrack. <hi>Peter Soderini,</hi> formerly ſpoken of, proceeded in all his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs with mildneſs and patience: and he and his Country proſpered, while the times agreed with his manner of proceedings: but when the times fell out ſo, that it was needful to break off all patience and mildneſs, he knew not how to do it: ſo that together with his Country he fell to ruine. Pope <hi>Julius</hi> the ſecond carried himſelf all the time of his Pontificate with great violence and rage, and becauſe the times ſorted well therewith, all his undertakings ſucceeded well. But if other times had come, that would have required other advice, of force he muſt have gone to deſtruction: becauſe he would never have altered his manner nor order in his proceedings. And that we cannot change our ſelves, there are two reaſons; the one becauſe we cannot reſiſt that which our nature is inclined to; the other is, becauſe when one man in ſuch a kind of proceeding hath gone on luckily, it is impoſſible to perſwade him, that things will prove well, where
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:30490:211"/>
hee proceeds otherwiſe. Whereupon it comes to paſs, that in one man fortune varies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhee changes the times, and he changes not his courſes. Thence ariſes alſo the ruine of a City, becauſe the orders of Common wealths change not with the times, as we have treated heretofore at large, but they are flower: for it is a greater trouble to them to change; and to effect it, they have need of times which ſhould in a manner take a Republick quite off the things whereby a thorough alteration ſhould be made in her: for which one man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone ſuffices not by changing the manner of her proceedings. And becauſe wee have made mention of <hi>Fabius Maximus,</hi> who held off <hi>Hannibal</hi> with delayes, I purpoſe to treate in the following Chapter, whether a Captain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſirous to fight a battel with the enemy in any caſe, can be ſo hindred that he do it not.</p>

times to reprove it. Wherefore though I have formerly ſeveral times ſhewed, how the actions about great matters now adays differ from thoſe of ancient times; yet I think it not ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous at this preſent to repeat it: for if in any part it differs from the ancient orders, it is eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in military orders, where now is not any of thoſe things obſerved, which the ancients made much account of. And this inconvenient grew firſt hereupon, becauſe Commonwealths and Princes, have committed this care to o<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> aſide that exerciſe; and if perchance ſometime a King in our days venture to go in perſon, we believe not therefore that he ſeeks out any new orders, that are more commendable: for when they chance to give themſelves to that imployment, they do it rather in ſhew of their pompe, then upon any other laudable occaſion. Yet do theſe commit leſſer errors, perſonally viſiting their armies, and keeping in their own hands the Majeſty of their Government, then Republikes do, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally thoſe of Italy, which truſt to others, not underſtanding any thing in the wars, or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to any thing belonging to them: and on the other ſide, when they are deſirous (whereby they may ſeem to be Princes) to take any thing into deliberation, they commit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in exceeding many errors. And however that other where I have treated of ſome of them, yet at this preſent I will not forbear to tell one of very great importance. When theſe lazy Princes, or effeminate Commonwealths ſend forth any Commander of theirs, the wiſeſt commiſſion that they think they can give him, is to charge him, that in any caſe he fight not a battel, but avoid it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiting
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:30490:212"/>
with themſelves that herein they imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate <hi>Fabius Maximus</hi> his diſcretion, who by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing to fight, ſaved the Romane State; they underſtand not that moſt commonly, this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion is either to no purpoſe, or elſe hurtful. For we muſt take this for a concluſion, that a General, that will abide in the field, cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void a battel, when the enemy will in any caſe fight. So that this commiſſion is but thus, as if he ſhould ſay, fight with thine enemy at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and not at thine own. For if a man will abide in the field and not fight, the ſureſt way is to keep himſelf fifty miles off from his enemy at leaſt, and then keep good eſpiouns, ſo that if he chance to bend towards thee, thou maiſt avoid him at leiſure. Another courſe is to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure himſelf up in a City; but the one and the other of theſe two courſes is very pernicious. In the firſt he leaves his Country in prey to the enemy; and a valiant Prince will rather hazard the battel than prolong the war with ſo much dammage to his Subjects. And in the ſecond the loſs is evident; for it muſt needs be, that retir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thy ſelf within the walls of a Town with thy Army, thou be beſiged, and at length ſuffer famine, and ſo be forced to yeeld: inſomuch as to avoid battel by either of theſe two means, muſt needs prove very hurtful. The courſe that <hi>Fabius Maximus</hi> held, to abide in ſtrong places is very good, when thou haſt an Army ſo valorous, that the enemy dares not come to find thee in thy advantages. Nor can it be ſaid that <hi>Fabius</hi> avoided fighting, but rather that he would fight at his advantage. For if <hi>Hannibal</hi> had gone to find him, <hi>Fabius</hi> would have ſtaid for him, and fought with him; but <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi> durſt not deal with him after his manner.
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:30490:212"/>
So the battel was as well avoided by <hi>Hannibal</hi> as by <hi>Fabius;</hi> but if one of them had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to have hazarded in any caſe, the other had but one of theſe three remedies, to wit thoſe two we have before mentioned, or to flie. There are many examples and maximes in the war, which the Romanes made with <hi>Philip</hi> of Macedon, Father of Perſes, to make good what I ſay; for <hi>Philip</hi> being aſſailed by the Romanes, reſolved not to come to battel; and therefore firſt he thought to do as <hi>Fabius Maximus</hi> had done in Italy, and placed himſelf with his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my upon the top of a mountain, where he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified himſelf all he could, deeming that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans had not the heart to come and find him there; but when they went thither, and fought with him, and drove him from the mountain, being not able to withſtand them, he fled with the greater part of his people: and that which ſaved him was the roughneſs of the Country, ſo that the Romans could not follow the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite. <hi>Philip</hi> then being unwilling to fight, and having pitcht his campe near the Romans, had no other mean but to fly; and having found by this experience, that when they meant not to fight, it was not enough for them to get upon the top of the mountains; and having no mind to incloſe himſelf in any Town, reſolved to take the other courſe, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move many miles diſtant from the Romanes Campe. Whereupon, if the Romanes were in one Province, they went into another, and ſo always they went thither from whence the Romanes were parted: and conſidering in the end, how that in prolonging the war this way, his own eſtate declined, and how that his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects were ſometimes by himſelf, otherwhile by
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:30490:213"/>
his enemies daily oppreſſed, reſolved to put it to the tryal of a day, and ſo came to a ſet bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel with the Romanes. It is profitable then not to fight, when the Armies have theſe conditions which <hi>Fabius</hi> his Army had, or that then had that of <hi>Cneus Sulpirius,</hi> which are, to have an Army ſo good, that the enemie dares not come and find thee within thy fortifications, and that the enemy though he be in thy Country, yet hath he not much footing therein, where he may ſuffer want of proviſions; and in this caſe the courſe is advantagious for the reaſons <hi>Titus Livius</hi> alledges: <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nwilling to ſtand at fortunes diſcretion on a try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi>

                        <hi>againſt his enemy, whom time and a ſtrange Country would daily wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and conſume.</hi> But in any other caſe the battel cannot be avoided, but with thy ſhame and danger: for to flie (as <hi>Philip</hi> did) is the ſame that it is to be routed, and that with the more diſgrace, by how much the leſs thou haſt made proof of thy valor. And however he had the luck to eſcape, another could not have had the like, unleſs he had help by the ſcituation of the Country, as well as he. That <hi>Hannibal</hi> was a maſter in the art of war, I think every one will acknowledge, and being to oppoſe <hi>Scipio</hi> in Affrica, if he had ſeen any advantage in prolonging the war, without doubt he would have done it, and peradventure could too (being a good Commander and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a good Army) as well as <hi>Fabius</hi> did in <hi>Italy.</hi> But being he did it not, we may well believe, that ſome important reaſon perſwaded him ſo; for a Prince that hath an Army levied, and ſees that for want of moneys or friends he cannot keep them long together, is a very fool if he
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:30490:213"/>
ventures not his fortune, before his Army falls aſunder; for by delaying he certainly loſes, whereas hazzarding he might overcome. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing there is yet much to be accounted of, which is, that a man ought (even in his loſing) ſeek to gain glory; and it is more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to be overcome by force, than by any other inconvenient, that may have made thee loſe. Therefore it muſt needs be that <hi>Hannibal</hi> was forc't by theſe neceſſities; and on the other ſide <hi>Scipio,</hi> if <hi>Hannibal</hi> would have protracted the war, and he durſt not have adventured to go ſeek him in his Trenches, had not ſuffered therein, in that he had already overcome <hi>Siphax,</hi> and taken ſo many Towns in Affrick, ſo that he could have continued there with ſecurity and convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, as well as in <hi>Italy.</hi> Which was not ſo with <hi>Hannibal,</hi> when he had to deal with <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius,</hi> nor with thoſe French-men, when they were oppoſed by <hi>Sulpitius.</hi> So much the leſs alſo can he avoid the fight, that with an Army invades another mans Country, he muſt (when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the enemie faces him) fight with him, and if he incampes before any Town, ſo much the rather is he obliged to fight, as in our days it befell Duke <hi>Charles</hi> of Burgundy, who being ſet down before Morat, a Town belonging to the Swiſſers, was aſſaulted by them and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: and ſo it chanc'd to the French Army, that incamping at Novarra, was in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner routed by the Swiſſers.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>THe Tribunes of the peoples power in Rome was great, and neceſſary, as many times we have ſaid: for otherwiſe it would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have been poſſible to bridle the Nobilities ambition, which would much ſooner, then it did, have corrupted that Commonwealth: yet becauſe in every thing (as is often ſaid) ſome evil proper to every thing lies lurking in it, which cauſes new accidents to ariſe, it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful with new orders to remedy them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Tribunitial power being grown inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and terrible to the Nobility, and to all Rome, ſome very hurtful inconvenient to the Romane liberty would have riſen, if the way had not been ſhewed by <hi>Appius Claudius,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they might defend themſelves againſt the Tribunes ambition: which was that they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways found ſome one among them, that either was fearful or might be corrupted, or that was a lover of the common good: ſo that they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed him to oppoſe other mens wills, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to draw forward any deliberation againſt the Senates will. Which remedy was a great allay to ſuch an authority, and a long time much helped Rome. Which thing hath made me conſider, that whenſoever many powerful ones are united together againſt one that is pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, though all they together are much more puiſſant then he, yet may there much more be
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:30490:214"/>
hoped for in him alone, though leſs powerful, then in thoſe many, though very ſtrong: for (leaving a part all thoſe things, wherein one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is able to do more then many, which things are innumerable) this will always come to paſs, that one alone, taking but a little care, ſhall be able to diſunite thoſe many, and ſo weaken that body which was ſtrong. I will not herein alledge ancient examples, which are very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent; the modern ſhall ſuffice me, which have faln in our days. In the year 1484. all Italy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired againſt the Venetians, who when they were in a manner wholly loſt, and could not any more abide in the field with their Army, they corrupted <hi>Lodwick</hi> that then ruled in Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and by means of that corruption made an accord, wherein they not only had again the towns they had loſt, but uſurped a part of the ſtate of Ferrara. And thus they that had been looſers in the war, remained gainers by the peace. A few years paſt, the whole world con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired againſt France; yet before they came to ſee the end of the war, Spain broke off from her confederates, and made agreement with her, in ſo much as the reſt of the confederates alſo were forced to make their accords too. So that without doubt, we ought always judge, when we ſee a war made by many againſt one, that that one is like to be a gainer at the end, provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he be of ſuch valour, that he is able to ſuſtain the firſt brunts, and ſo govern himſelf with the time as to attend time: which if he were not able to do, he would run the hazard of many dangers, as it happened to the Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in the eighth year, who if they could have temporiſed with the French Army, and ſo have had time to gain themſelves ſome
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:30490:215"/>
of thoſe that were confederated againſt them, they might have eſcaped that deſtruction, but not having ſo good an Army, as thereby to play with the enemy awhile; and hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on not having had leiſure to take any of them aſunder, they were ruined: for we ſaw, that the Pope when he had what was his, became their friend, and ſo Spaine, and very willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the one and the other of theſe two Princes would have ſaved them the ſtate of Lombardy againſt France, for fear of making it too great in Italy, if it had been in their power. The Venetians then might have given a part, to ſave the reſt, which if they had done in time, that it had appeared it was not of extream ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, and before the beginning of the war, would have been wiſely done of them; but when the wars were begun, it was diſgraceful, and peradventure of ſmall benefit. But before ſuch imbroiles, few of the Citizens of Venice could foreſee the danger, very few the way to help, and none to adviſe it. But to return a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to the beginning of this diſcourſe, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that even ſo as the Senate of Rome had a remedy to ſave their country from the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes ambition, becauſe they were many, ſo ſhall any Prince that is aſſailed by many, finde a remedy, whenſoever he knows with diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion how to uſe the convenient means to diſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite them.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>That a wiſe Commander upon his own ſouldiers ſhould lay all manner of neceſſity to fight, and take it, as much as he can, from his enemies.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>AT other times we have treated, of what advantage neceſſity is to hamane actions, and to what glory they have thereby been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted; and that by ſome moral Philoſophers it hath been written, that mens hands and tongues two of their worthieſt inſtruments to ennoble them, would never have worked ſo perfectly, nor have brought mens labors to that excellency, whereunto we ſee them now come, had they not been thruſt forward by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity. The vertue then of ſuch neceſſity being known by the ancient Commanders of Armies, and how thereby the ſouldiers minds were made the more obſtinate to fight, they uſed all their induſtry, to force them by it. And on the other ſide, they aſwell endeavored, to free their enemies from it; and hereupon many times they opened that way to the enemy, which they could have ſhut againſt them, and ſhut it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their own ſoldiers, which they could have left open for them. He then that deſires, either that a City defend it ſelf obſtinately, or that an Army in the field fight it out reſolutely, muſt try his wits to make an impreſſion in the breſts of them that are to fight, that ſuch a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity lies upon them. Whereupon a diſcreet Commander that is going to beſige a Town, may conjecture of the facility or difficulty in taking it, by the knowledge and conſideration
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:30490:216"/>
of the neceſſity that binds the inhabitants to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelves; and as he finds the neceſſity urging them to be great, ſo let him judge it difficult to overcome them, or otherwiſe eaſie. Whence it proceeds, that thoſe Towns which have rebelled, are harder to be regained then they were at their firſt conqueſt; for in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning not having any cauſe to fear puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as not having offended, they yeeld eaſily; but thinking (after they have rebelled) that they have offended, and hereupon fearing the chaſtiſement, they prove harder to be recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Moreover ſuch obſtinacy ariſes from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate hatreds which neighboring Princes and Republiques, bear one to another, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from their ambition to rule, and the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie of their own ſtate, eſpecially if they be Republikes as it chances in Tuſcany. Which ſtrife and contention hath cauſed, and ever will, a great difficulty in the maſtery of the one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Whereof he that conſiders well the City of Florences neighbors, and thoſe of Venice, will not marvel (as many do) that Florence hath ſpent more in her wars, and gained leſs then Venice, for this is, becauſe the Venetians never found their neighboring Towns ſo obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in their defence, as Florence hath; for that all the Towns confining upon Venice have been accuſtomed to live in ſubjection under a Prince, and not free; and thoſe that have been uſed to ſerve, make ſmall account of changing their Lord, or rather many times they much deſire it. So that Venice (however ſhe hath had more powerful neighbors then Florence) yet becauſe ſhe hath found the Townes leſſe obſtinate againſt her, hath been able ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to ſubdue them then the other could,
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:30490:216"/>
being enuironed round, by free Towns. A Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander therefore ſhould (to return to our firſt diſcourſe) when he ſits down before any Town, provide with all diligence to take from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants all ſcruples of ſuch neceſſity, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſuch obſtinacy, promiſing pardon, if they are afraid of puniſhment: and if they doubt their liberty is aimed at, ſhew them there is nothing intended againſt the common good, but againſt ſome few ambitious men in the City, which thing hath, many times facilitated ſuch enterpriſes and takings of Towns. And though ſuch colours are eaſily ſeen through, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by underſtanding men, yet are the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple oſt deceived thereby, who being deſirous of the preſent peace, ſhut their eyes againſt any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſnare that under large promiſes can be laid for them. And this way exceeding many Cities have been reduced to ſervitude, as it befell Florence in theſe latter days, and <hi>Craſſus</hi> alſo with his whole Army, who though he knew the Parthians promiſes were not to be credited, which were made onely to take from his ſoldiers the neceſſity of defending themſelves, yet could he not keep them obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, being blinded by the offers of peace made them by their enemies, as in particular may be ſeen in his life, by him that ſhall read it. When the Samnites, contrary to the articles of agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, upon the ambition of ſome few had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged and ſpoiled the Romans their confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates fields, and afterwards ſent Ambaſſadors to Rome to require peace, offering to make reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of all that was taken, and deliver them priſoners the authors of thoſe broyles and robberies, they were refus'd by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, and ſent back to Samnium without
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:30490:217"/>
hope of agreement: <hi>Claudius Pontius</hi> the commander of the Samnites Army, with a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table oration of his ſhewed, the Romans would have war in any caſe; and though for their own parts they wiſhed for peace, yet neceſſity made them take the war in hand, ſaying theſe words, <hi>They juſtly take arms that are forced to do ſo; and piouſly too</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Juſtum eſt bellum, quibus neceſſarium; &amp; pia arma, quibus niſi in armis ſpes non eſt.</note> 
                        <hi>who have no other hope but in them.</hi> Upon which neceſſity he with his ſouldiers grounded his hopes of victory. And to the end I need not return again to this matter, I think it fit to alledge thoſe examples of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, which are moſt worthy of remarke; <hi>Caius Manilius</hi> went forth with an army to incounter the Veientes, and part of their Army having forced his trenches, <hi>Manilius</hi> came ſpeedily with new Troops to ſucour his own, and that the Veientes ſhould not eſcape, guarded all the paſſages into the campe. Whereupon the Veientes ſeeing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſhut in of all ſides, began to fight with ſuch fury, that they ſlew <hi>Manilius,</hi> and would have otherthrown all the reſt of the Romans, if, by the wiſdom of one Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bune, a way for them to eſcape by, had not been opened. Where we ſee that whiles ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity conſtraned the Veientes to fight, they ſtood to it ſtoutly; but as ſoon as a way was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened for them, they thought more upon flying then fighting. The Volſci and Equi having ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with their armies upon the Roman territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, the Conſuls were ſent againſt them, and whiles they were in fight, the Volſcies army, the chief whereof was <hi>Vectius Metius,</hi> chanced to to be incloſed between their own trenches,
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:30490:217"/>
which the <hi>Romans</hi> were now become maſters of, and the other <hi>Roman</hi> Army, who ſeeing they muſt all either die or make way by the ſword, he ſpake thus to his ſoldiers, <hi>Come along with mee; there is neither rampire nor ditch to oppoſe you,</hi>

For want of Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers the <hi>Romans</hi> put many ſlaves in Armes, and gave order to <hi>Sempronius Gracchus</hi> to train them, who in a ſmall time made a very good Army of them. <hi>Pelopidas</hi> and <hi>Epaminondas</hi> (as we have ſaid otherwhere) after they had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered <hi>Thebes</hi> their native Country out of the <hi>Spartans</hi> bondage, made the <hi>Thebans</hi> exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good Soldiers in a ſhort time, that they were able not only to ſuſtain', but overcome the Soldiers of <hi>Sparta;</hi> ſo that the caſe is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual on both ſides: for the one being good, may ſoon find the other ſo: yet a good Army with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a good head, ordinarily becomes inſolent and dangerous; as was the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Army after <hi>Alexander</hi> his death, and likewiſe the Veterane ſoldiers in the civil warres. So that I think, that much more account is to be made of a Commander that hath time and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience to train up and arme his Soldiers, than of an inſolent Army, having a Captain from among them tumultuarily made their Chief. Wherefore double glory and renown may well be aſcrib'd to thoſe Commanders, who have not only taken upon them to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome

                     <p>OF what moment in combates and fights a new accident is, that ariſes upon any new matter ſeen or heard, appears in many places, and eſpecially in that occaſion, where the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> fought with the <hi>Volſci,</hi> where <hi>Qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ntius</hi> ſeeing one of the horns of his Army beginning to fayle, began to cry out aloud, that they ſhould ſtand firm: becauſe the other horne of the Army was already victorious: by which words, having encourag'd his own, and affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his enemies, hee overcame them. And if ſuch vociſerations in an Army well orderd be of great effect, in one then that is but tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary and ill diſciplind, they muſt needs be of much greater: becauſe the whole frame there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of moves by the like wind. To this purpoſe I will alledge a notable example befaln in our dayes. The City of <hi>Perugia,</hi> a few years ſince, was divided into two factions, of the <hi>Oddi,</hi> and the <hi>Bagliori;</hi> theſe raignd there, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were baniſhd men, who having by help of their allies gotten an Army together, and
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:30490:219"/>
brought it into ſome Town conſining upon <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rugia,</hi> by favour of their faction one night enterd the City, &amp; without being deſcryd, came to take the <hi>Piazza;</hi> &amp; becauſe that City hath chains on all the corners of the waies, which kept them bard, the Soldiers belonging to the <hi>Oddi</hi> had a man went before them, who with a bar of Iron was to break the locks of thoſe chains, to the end the horſe might paſs, &amp; there being but one only left them to break, which immediately opened into the <hi>Piazza,</hi> and now a generall alarme being given, and he that broke them, being oppreſſed by the multitude that followd him, and not able therefore well to lift up his armes with his bar, whereby to imploy it, chanc'd to ſay Stand back; which word going by degrees, ſaying back, began to cauſe the furtheſt off to flie, and ſo by little and little the reſt with ſuch force, that they all routed one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. And thus the deſign of the <hi>Oddi,</hi> by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of ſo poor an accident, became fruſtrate. Where we may conſider, that diſcipline and order is not uſefull in an Army ſo much for orderly fighting, as that every ſmall accident put thee not quite into diſorder: for, were it for nothing elſe, the ordinary multitude is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for the warrs, becauſe every rumor, every voice, every noiſe changes them, and puts them to flight. And therefore a good Commander, among his other orders, ought appoint thoſe that are to take the word from him, &amp; to paſs it to others, and accuſtome his Soldiers, ſo that they give no credit ſave only to their own offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, to the end that they tell them only, what is given them in charge from him: for when this part is not well obſerv'd, many diſorders often fall out. Touching the ſight of theſe new
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:30490:220"/>
things every Commander ought well bend his wits, to make ſome ſhew whiles the battail is in tryal, whereby to encourage his own, and diſhearten the enemy, becauſe among thoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents which may give thee the victory, this is the moſt effectuall. Whereof wee alledge for teſtimony the example of <hi>Cneus Sulpitius</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Dictatour, who comming to fight a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell with the French, arm'd all the poor drud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and raſcality of the Camp: and having mounted them upon Mules and poor Aſſes with armes and enſignes, to make them ſeem as if they were cavallry, he plac'd them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind a hill, and commanded that at a ſignall given, whiles he was in the hotteſt of the battel they ſhould ſhew themſelves to the enemy, which thing ſo ordered and done, put the French men in ſuch a fright that they loſt they day. And therefore a good Commander ought to do two things; the one is, to try ſome of theſe inventions to ſtartle the enemy: the other, to ſtand ſo prepard that the enemy offering any ſuch to him, he may be able to diſcover and quite fruſtrate them, as did the Indian King to <hi>Semiramis;</hi> who ſeeing, that King had a great number of Elephants, to affright him, and make him think ſhee had more her ſelf than he, made a great many of them of Bulls and Bufaloes hides, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving put them upon Camells, ſent them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: but that King finding out her deceit, turnd it upon her not only vain but hurtfull. <hi>Mammercus</hi> was ſent Dictator againſt the <hi>Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates,</hi> who to affright the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed that in the heat of the skirmiſh a good number of ſoldiers ſhould ſally forth of <hi>Fidenas</hi> with lights upon the top of their Lances, to
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:30490:220"/>
the end that the <hi>Romans</hi> taken a while with the novelty of the matter, ſhould fall into ſome diſorder. Whereupon it is to be noted, that when ſuch devices carry more truth than ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance with them, they may well be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the view of men, becauſe that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in them a great deal of that which is live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and likely, their weakneſs cannot ſo quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be diſcoverd: but when they have more of fiction in them than of truth, it is better either not to uſe them, or uſing them to keep them off at ſuch a diſtance that a full diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of them cannot ſuddenly be made, as was that trick of the Muleters <hi>Cn. Sulpitius</hi> practiſd: for when there is nothing but weakneſs within them, as they are approached, they are quickly ſeen through, and do thee wrong rather than give thee advantage, as thoſe Elephants did to <hi>Semiramis,</hi> and the fires to the <hi>Fidenates;</hi> which however that at firſt they a little trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the Army, yet when the Dictatour came up to them, and began to cry out, That they might be aſhamd to fly from the ſmoak like Bees, but that they ſhould rather turn back their ſlames upon them, ſaying, <hi>Bnrne out theſe people of Fidenas with fire,</hi>

                        <p>That the command of an Army ought to be given in charge only to one; and where there are more, they alwaies erre.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THe <hi>Fidenates</hi> having rebelld, and ſlain that Colony, which the <hi>Romans</hi> had ſent to <hi>Fidenas,</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> created four Tribuns with Conſular power to exact ſatisfaction for this wrong done: whereof one being left for the ſafeguard of <hi>Rome,</hi> the reſt were ſent againſt the <hi>Fidenates,</hi> and the <hi>Vejentes,</hi> who becauſe they were at variance one with another, brought back diſgrace from the ſervice, though no loſs: of the diſgrace they were the cauſe, but that they receivd no loſs, the Soldiers va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour was the cauſe. Whereupon the <hi>Romans</hi> ſeeing this diſorder, had their recourſe to the creation of a Dictator, to the end one alone ſhould rectifie again, what three had diſorderd. Whence we ſee the unprofitableneſs of many Commanders in one Army or Town, that is to defend it ſelf: and <hi>T. Livius</hi> cannot more plainly expreſs it, than in theſe words, here written; <hi>Three</hi> Tribuns <hi>with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſular power taught us how unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table</hi>

                        <hi>a thing it was, to have many Commanders in the warr; for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of them making ſeverall parties, and each one thinking his own beſt, gave opportunity to the enemy.</hi> And however that this is example ſufficient to prove the diſorder which a plurality of
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:30490:221"/>
Commanders cauſes in the war, yet will I alledge ſome other as well modern as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, for the better declaration of it. In the year 1500. after the repriſal of <hi>Milan</hi> by <hi>Lewes</hi> the twelfth of <hi>France,</hi> he ſent his Army to <hi>Piſa,</hi> to reſtore it to the <hi>Florentines,</hi> whether <hi>John Baptiſta Ridolphi</hi> and <hi>Luke Antony</hi> of the Albizzi were ſent Commiſſaries. And becauſe <hi>Iohn Baptiſta</hi> was a man of credit and years, <hi>Luke</hi> left the whole government in every thing unto him. And if he did not diſcover his ambition in oppoſing him, yet he manifeſted it by his ſilence, and neglecting and ſcorning every thing that was orderd, ſo that he nothing furtherd the actions of the Campe neither in word nor in deed, as if he had been a man of no worth. But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it appeared quite contrary, when upon an occaſion following, <hi>Iohn Baptiſta</hi> was fain to returne to <hi>Florence; Luke</hi> being left alone ſhewd his abilities, both by his courage, induſtry and counſell. All which things were in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner quite loſt in him, while he had a compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I will anew produce in confirmation here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>T. Livius</hi> his words, who relating, how that <hi>Quintius</hi> and <hi>Agrippa</hi> his Collegue, being ſent by the <hi>Romans</hi> againſt the <hi>Aequi,</hi> the whole diſpoſing of the war was in <hi>Quintius</hi> his hands, and ſaies: <hi>In the managing of weighty affaires, it is the ſafeſt</hi>

                        <hi>way to commit the main charge to one.</hi> Which is clean contrary, to what is now adaies practiſed by our Republicks and Princes: who uſe to ſend into thoſe places, that they may the better or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, more Commiſſaries, and more Commanders than one, which cauſes much
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:30490:222"/>
confuſion: and if the occaſion were inquired after, why the Italian and French Armies are now adaies ruined, we ſhould find this had been the principall. And it may truly be concluded, that it is to more purpoſe to imploy one man alone of but ordinary judgement in ſuch an expedition, then two very able men together with equall commiſſion.</p>

                        <p>In times of difficulty and perill true worth and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is ſought after, and in calme and quiet times, not mens vertues, but their wealth, friends, and parentage preferre them.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IT was alwaies and ever will be, that great perſonages and the worthyeſt men, in peaceable times, are of ſmall eſteem: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of envy, following the reputation which their vertue hath gained them, in ſuch times there are many Citizens, that are ambitious, not only to bee their equals, but ſuperiors; and to this purpoſe there is a place in <hi>Thucydi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> the Greeke Hiſtorian, which ſerves very fitly, where he ſhewes that when the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Republick came off victour in the <hi>Peloponne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> war, and had taken down the <hi>Spartanes</hi> pride, and in a manner ſubjected all Greece, the <hi>Athenians</hi> conceited ſo highly of themſelves, as that they deſigned the conqueſt of <hi>Sicile</hi> alſo. This enterpriſe came to be diſputed in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens: Alcibiades</hi> and ſome other Citizens per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:30490:222"/>
it, as they that little caring for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good, thought only upon the advancing their own particular reputations, each one of them having hopes to bee ſent Commander in the imployment. But <hi>Nicias</hi> that was the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal among the beſt reputed of <hi>Athens,</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded it: and the greateſt reaſon he alledged in perſwading the people to give credit to his words, was this, becauſe while hee adviſed them thus that the warr ſhould nor proceed, he perſwaded them to that which was not for his advantage; for while <hi>Athens</hi> was in peace, he knew, there were many Citizens would go before him; but in time of war hee was ſure none could go before, no nor come near him. Wee ſee therefore, that in Republicks there is this diſorder, in times of peace to make ſmall account of able men, which thing enrages them two ſeveral waies, the one to ſee their own degrees fayl them; the other to ſee unworthy men, and of ſmaller abilities then themſelves, made their companions or rather their ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors: which diſorder in Republicks hath cauſed much deſtruction; for thoſe Citizens who ſee themſelves undeſervedly deſpiſed, and know that quiet times are the occaſion thereof, deviſe all the wayes they can to diſturbe them, ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſting inducements to new wars in prejudice of the Commonwealth. And deviſing what might be the remedies hereof, we find two; the one to keep the Citizens alwaies poor, to the end that riches without vertue ſhould not be able to corrupt neither thoſe nor others: the other to be alwaies ſo ready for the war, as that they may be able continually to make war, &amp; may have need alwaies of well reputed Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, as <hi>Rome</hi> did in her firſt beginnings; for
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:30490:223"/>
that City having alwaies ſome Armyes abroad, there was ever place left to mens vertues, nor could they bereave ſuch a one of his dignity, that deſerved it; or confer it upon another not deſerving it; for in caſe that ſuch a thing were done, ſome times upon miſtake or for tryall, there quickly enſued ſuch a diſorder thereupon and a danger, that all returned preſently into the right way. But theſe other Common-wealths, that are not ſo ordered as ſhee, and that then only make war when neceſſity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains them, cannot free themſelves of ſuch an inconvenient, or rather they will alwaies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr it, and there will ever ſome diſorder be ready to ariſe, when that vertuous Citizen thus neglected is of a revengefull diſpoſition, and hath in the City ſome good repute and corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence; and from this the City of <hi>Rome</hi> kept her ſelf free a good while. Yet ſhe (after ſhe had ſubdu'd <hi>Carthage</hi> and <hi>Antiochus,</hi> as we ſaid otherwhere, being no more in doubt of the iſſue of her warrs) thought ſhe might give the Command of her Armies to whom ſhe pleas'd, not ſo much regarding their vertues as their other qualities, ingratiating them with the people: for we ſee <hi>Paulus Emilius</hi> had ſeveral repulſes in demanding the Conſulate, before he was made Conſul, till the <hi>Macedonian</hi> war chanc'd, which becauſe it was thought dangerous, by general conſent of the City was committed to him. In our City of <hi>Florence</hi> after the year 1494. many warrs following, one upon the neck of the other, and all the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of <hi>Florence</hi> having made unlucky tryal of themſelves, the City by chance lit upon one man who-ſhewed them the manner how their Armies were to be commanded, which
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:30490:223"/>
was <hi>Antoni Giacomini:</hi> and whiles the warrs in hand were perillous, the other Citizens am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions ceaſ'd; and in the election of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary or Commander of their Armies, he had no competitor ſtood with him. But when as any war was to be made where no hazard was, but a great deal of honor and dignity, he found alwaies ſo many competitors, that they being to make election of there Commiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to beleager <hi>Piza,</hi> he was left out of the number. And however it was not perceiv'd evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, that evill would befall the State, becauſe <hi>Antony</hi> was not ſent thither, yet may we eaſily conjecture, becauſe the <hi>Piſans</hi> having no means for further defence or ſuſtenance, had <hi>Antony</hi> been ſent thither, they would before that have been ſo ſtraightly beſet, that they ſhould have ſurrendred themſelves to the <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines</hi> directions. But they being beſieged by Commanders that underſtood not how to begirt, nor force them, were ſo long held in hand, that the City of <hi>Florence</hi> bought them, whereas they might have had them by force. It was likely that ſuch a diſtaſte with <hi>Antony</hi> might have done much, and he had need truly of much patience, and ſo good a diſpoſition as not to deſire revenge hereupon, either with the deſtruction of the City (if he were able) or with the wrong of any particular Citizen, where of a Republick ought to beware, as in the Chapter following we ſhall treate.</p>

                     <p>A Commonwealth ſhould be well advis'd, never to commit any weighty ſervice to any one, to whom any notable injury hath been done. <hi>Claudius Nero</hi> (who left his Army which he had lying in front againſt <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal,</hi> and with part thereof went into the Marches to find the other Conſul, to combate <hi>Aſdrubal,</hi> before he ſhould joyn with <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal)</hi> had formerly in Spain been incamp'd againſt <hi>Aſdrubal,</hi> and having ſhut him up in a place with his Army, ſo that <hi>Aſdrubal,</hi> was either to fight at diſadvantage, or periſh by famin, was cunningly by <hi>Aſdrubal</hi> ſo long held in hand with certain treaties of agreement, that hee ſcap'd him, and took from him the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity he had to ſuppreſs him. Which thing being known at <hi>Rome,</hi> got him great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit as well with the Senate as the people, and he was ſpoken of very diſgracefully throughout the City, to his great diſreputation and deſpight thereat too: but being after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards made Conſul, and ſent againſt <hi>Hannibal,</hi> took the courſe we have ſaid, which was a very dangerous one, ſo that <hi>Rome</hi> was amazed and in tumults, till news arived of <hi>Aſdrubals</hi> defeat, and <hi>Claudius</hi> being afterwards asked
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:30490:224"/>
on what ground he undertook ſo dangerous a courſe, where without an extream neceſſity he had hazarded the liberty of <hi>Rome,</hi> anſwer'd that he had done it, becauſe if it prov'd lucky, he ſhould recover the glory he had formerly loſt in Spain: and if it fayl'd him, and this courſe fell out croſs, he knew he ſhould be reveng'd of that City and thoſe Citizens, who had unthankfully and undiſcreetly wrong'd him. And when theſe paſſions, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing from ſuch offences, are of ſuch force in a Citizen of <hi>Rome,</hi> and in thoſe dayes before corruption was crept into <hi>Rome,</hi> we may well gheſſe how powerfull they are in a Citizen of ſuch a City that is not ſo regulated nor or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd as ſhe then was: and becauſe to ſuch like diſorders which grow up in Common-wealths, no certain remedy can be aſſign'd, there followes an impoſſibility to frame a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Commonwealth for by many unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed waies deſiruction breaks in upon it.</p>

them returned to their quarters, but both of them choſe rather to withdraw themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the adjoyning hills, where they thought they might be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more ſecure, and the <hi>Roman</hi> Army divided itſelf into two parts, whereof the one went with the Conſul, the other with one <hi>Tempanius</hi> a Centurion, whoſe valor that day kept the <hi>Roman</hi> Army from being wholly routed; the morning being come, the <hi>Roman</hi> Conſul, without hearing further of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, retired towards <hi>Rome,</hi> and the like did the Equies Armie, becauſe each of theſe thought the enemy had been victour, and therefore they each withdrew themſelves, without any regard that they left their Campes in prey to the Enemy. It fell out that <hi>Tempanius</hi> who was there with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, retiring too, learned by certain wounded ſoldiers of the <hi>Equi,</hi> that their Captaines were gone and had abandoned their quarters, upon which news he went into the <hi>Roman</hi> quarters and ſaved them, but ſacked thoſe of the <hi>Equi,</hi> and ſo returned victorious to <hi>Rome:</hi> which victory (as wee ſee) conſiſts only in, who hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the enemies diſorder.

                     </argument>
                     <p>THe Commonwealth of <hi>Rome</hi> was in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtion, becauſe of the differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Nobles and the Commons: never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs as occaſion of wars was offered them, they ſent forth with their Armies <hi>Quintius</hi> and <hi>Appius Claudius: Appius</hi> becauſe he was cruell and rough in commanding, was ill obeyed by thoſe that followed him, ſo that almoſt quite broken he fled from his charge. <hi>Quintius</hi> by uſing a mild and gentle behaviour towards his ſoldiers, found them very obedient, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with victory. Whereupon it ſeems, that to governe a multitude, it is better to be courteous then inſolent, compaſſionate rather then cruel. Notwithſtanding <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> with whom many other writers agree, in a ſaying of his, concludes the contrary, where he ſaies, <hi>To rule a multitude, ſeverity is of more force then mildneſs.</hi> And <note place="margin">In multitudine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genda, plus paena quam obſequium valet.</note> deviſing with my ſelf how each of theſe opinions may be made good, I

ſay either thou art to governe men that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily are thy companions, or that are alwaies in ſubjection to thee. When they are thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, ſeverity or rigour cannot fully be us'd againſt them according as <hi>Cornelius</hi> argues: and becauſe the common people of <hi>Rome</hi> had equal power in the <hi>Roman</hi> government with the Nobility, he that became Prince among them for a time, could not rule them with roughneſs and rigor. And many time it was evident, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Commanders did more good that got the good wills of their ſoldiers, and held but a gentle hand over them, then thoſe that by rough handling kept them in a ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh aw of them, unleſs they were accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni'd with extraordinary endowments, as was <hi>Manlius Tarquatus.</hi> But he that commands over ſubjects (whereof <hi>Cornelius</hi> diſcourſes) to the end they grow not inſolent, and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of thy two great mildneſs tread thee not under foot, ought rather betake himſelf to rigor then gentleneſs. But this a ſo is not to exceed moderation, for fear of incurring ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred: for it never turns to any Princes advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to gain the peoples hate. The way to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void it is, to lay no hands on the ſubjects eſtates: for of blood (when rapine is not the covert cauſe there) no Prince is thirſty, unleſs forc'd thereto, which ſeldome he is: but where ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine is mixt, this neceſſity comes alwaies upon them, nor ever want they occaſion, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſhed blood, as in another treaty to this purpoſe is diſcours'd at large. <hi>Quintius</hi> was more praiſe worthy then <hi>Appius;</hi> and yet the ſaying of <hi>Cornelius</hi> limited as it ought to be, but not in the caſe obſerv'd by <hi>Appius,</hi> deſerves approbation. And becauſe we have ſpoken of

Which when they of the Town underſtood, <hi>Camillus</hi> his humanity and integrity ſo much pleasd them, that not deſiring longer to defend themſelves, they reſolv'd to render up the Town to him. Where it is to be conſidered by this true example, how much more a curteous and charitable act works in mens minds then any one full of cruelty and violence; and how that many times thoſe countries and cities; that

no weapons, nor warlick inſtruments, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other force of man hath been able to open, one action of humanity, piety, chaſtity, or libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity hath laid wide open.

                     <argument>
                        <p>From whence it came, that Hannibal by a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of proceeding different from that of Scipioes, wrought the ſame effects in Italy, which the other did in Spaine.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>I Think, that ſome men could well marvaile, ſeeing certain Commanders (notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they have led a contrary courſe of life) bring to effect the like things, which they have done that lived in the manner above written: ſo that it appears, that the cauſe of theſe victories depends not upon the aforeſaid reaſons; and it ſeems that thoſe waies gain thee neither more force nor better fortune, being that glory and reputation may be gotten by contrary courſes. And not to part from the men I have above written of, and the better to clear what I propounded, I ſay, as we ſee <hi>Scipio</hi> enter into <hi>Spain,</hi> and by his humanity and mildneſs gain the friendſhip of that whole country, and for them be adored and admired of thoſe nations: on the contrary ſide wee ſee <hi>Hannibal</hi> enter into Italy, uſing all contrary waies, which is, by violence, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty and rapine, and all manner of infidelity, worke the ſame effect that <hi>Scipio</hi> did in <hi>Spain:</hi> for to <hi>Hannibal</hi> all the Towns in <hi>Italy</hi> rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and all the people ran after him. And conſidering whence this may ariſe, we ſee therein many reaſous: the firſt is, that men are deſirous of new matters, inſomuch as very often times as well they that live at caſe, as they who
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:30490:229"/>
do not, deſire novelty: for (as we ſaid otherwhere, and it is true) men are as well glutted with good, as afflicted and vexed with evill. This deſire therefore opens the gates wide to every one, that in any Country makes himſelf the cheif of any innovation. And be he a ſtranger, they run after him; if of the Country, they come all about him, they ſtrengthen and favour him, ſo that in what ſort ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be he proceeds, he comes to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance exceedingly in thoſe places. Beſides this, men are thruſt forward by two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal things, either by love or feare, ſo that he as well commands them that makes himſelf beloved, as he that cauſes himſelf to be feared; and moſt commonly he is more followed and obeyed that makes himſelf be feared, then he that makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf beloved. Therefore it little imports a Commander by which of theſe wayes he goes, provided that he be a Worthy man, and that worth cauſes him to be of great repute among men: for when that worth is great as it was in <hi>Hannibal</hi> and <hi>Scipio,</hi> it cancells all the errors they commit, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the great love they beare them, or the great feare they ſtand in of them. For from the one and the other of theſe two waies great inconveniences may ariſe, of force to ruine a Prince: for he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to be too much belov'd, any little that he ſwerves from the true way, becomes contemptible. And that other who would be too much feared, when he a little exceeds the mean, growes odious; and to
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:30490:229"/>
keep the middle way it is not poſſible: for our nature will not comport it. But it is neceſſary to allay theſe things, that exceed, with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary worth, as <hi>Ha nibal</hi> and <hi>Scpio</hi> both did: yet it appeard that the one and the other of them were endamag'd by their manner of life, for which they were eſteem'd and valu'd. The valuation of both of them we have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſpoke of: the damage as for <hi>Scipio,</hi> was that his own Soldiers in Spain together with ſome of his friends mutined againſt him, which proceeded from nothing elſe than becauſe they feard him not: for men are ſo unſetled that upon the leaſt overture made to their am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, they forth with forget all the good will they owe their Prince for his mildneſs and courteſie, as did the aforeſaid Soldiers and friends, in ſo much as <hi>Scipio,</hi> to remedie this inconvenient, was conſtraind to practiſe that cruelty in ſome part, which he had abhor'd. As for <hi>Hannibal,</hi> we have no particular exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, where the cruelty he us'd, or his ſmall faith did him any harm. But we may well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that Naples and many other Townes that continued in obedience to the Romans, did it for fear thereof. This we ſee plainly, that his wicked manner of living, made him more odious to the people of Rome, than any other enemy that Commonwealth ever had: ſo that, whereas to <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> (while he was with his Armie in Italy) they diſcoverd the party that intended to poyſon him, they never forgave it <hi>Hannibal</hi> (though diſarm'd and baniſh'd) till they had made an end of him. Theſe incommodities then accru'd to <hi>Hannibal</hi> for being held impious, a breaker of his faith, and cruel: but on the other ſide, he thereby
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:30490:230"/>
got one very great advantage, which is much admired by all Writers, that in his army (though compoſed of ſeveral Nations) there never aroſe any mutiny, neither among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor againſt him. Which we caunot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive from any other cauſe than from the terror that grew from his perſon, which was ſo great, mixt with the reputation he gave of his valor, that it kept his Soldiers in quietneſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord. I conclude then, that it imports not much, in which of theſe two waies a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander proceeds, provided he hath ſo great worth in him, as may well ſeaſon the one and the other manner of living: for (as it is ſaid) both in the one and the other there is defect and danger, when it is not corrected by ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary endowments. And if <hi>Hannibal</hi> and <hi>Scipio,</hi> the one by commendable means, and the other by deteſtable courſes, wrought the ſame effect, me thinks I ſhould not forbear to diſcourſe alſo of two Roman Citizens, who by ſeveral wayes, but both honorable, attaind one and the ſame glory.</p>

                        <p>How Manlius Torquatus his rigor, and Valereus Corvinus his mildneſs, gaind each of them the ſame glory.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>AT the ſame time there were in Rome two famous Captaines, <hi>Monlius Torquatus</hi> and <hi>Valerius Corvinus:</hi> who both of equal vertue, had a like triumph'd, and liv'd in equal credit &amp; reputation in Rome; &amp; each of them (touching the enemy) had with equal valor gained it; but as for the Armyes, and treating of their
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:30490:230"/>
Soldiers, they proceeded exceeding differently: for <hi>Manlius</hi> with all kind of ſeverity comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them, without intermitting his Soldiers pains or puniſhments. <hi>Valerius</hi> on the other part in all kinds and termes of courtefie treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with a familiar way of affability; for it appears, that the one to keep his Soldiers in obedience put his own ſon to death, and the other never hurt any. Yet in ſuch a differency of proceeding, each produc'd the ſame fruit, as well to the enemies loſs, as the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths profit, and his own particular; for never any Soldier refus'd the fight or mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tini'd againſt them, or in any part diſagreed from their wills, however that <hi>Manlius</hi> his commands were ſo rigorous, that all other kinds of commands, which exceeded meaſure in everity, were termed <hi>Manlian commands.</hi> Where we are firſt to conſider, whence it was that <hi>Manlius</hi> was conſtrained to proceed ſo rigidly: the next is, what was the cauſe that theſe two different waies brought forth the ſame effect: and in the laſt place, which is the better of the two, and more profitable to imitate. If any man conſider well <hi>Manlius</hi> his diſpoſition, from the time that <hi>T. Livius</hi> begins to make mention of him, he ſhall find him, a very valiant man, religiouſly loving his Father and his Countrey, and exceedingly reverencing his Superiors. Theſe things we gather from the ſlaughter of the Frenchmen, from the defence of his Father a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Tribune, and in that before he went to fight with the Frenchmen, he went to the Conſul, with theſe words, <hi>Without thy allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Injuſſu tuo adverſus haſtem nunquam pugnabo, non ſi cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam victoriam videam.</note> 
                        <hi>I will never fight
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:30490:231"/>
with the enemy; no though I were aſſured of victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> When a man then ſo diſpos'd attains to ſuch dignity as to command, he deſires to find all other men like himſelf, and his ſtrong courage moves him to command ſtrong and ſtout things: and the ſame (when once they are commanded) will likewiſe that they be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; and the rule is moſt certain, that when rigid and hard things are commanded, it is fit with rigour to ſee them obſervd; otherwiſe wouldſt thou find thy ſelf much deciv'd. Where it is to be noted that if a man will be obeyed, it is neceſſary he know how to command; and they know how to command, that make a compariſon between their own quality, and theirs that are to obey; and when they ſee a proportion, then let them command; but when a diſproportion, let them forbeare. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a wiſe man ſaid, that to hold a Common-wealth by violence and force, it was needfull there were a proportion between the perſon forcing, and the party forced: and whenever that proportion was, there it was credible that that violence would laſt: but when the party forced was of more force than the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon forcing, it might be doubted that violence would every day fail. But returning to our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. I ſay, that to command ſtout and ſtrong things it is neceſſary to be ſtout too: and he that is of this ſtoutneſs, and commands ſuch things, can never by mildneſs cauſe them to be obſerv'd: but he that hath not thiſ ſtrength of courage, ought beware of theſe extraordinary commands, and in thoſe ordinary he may well uſe his own humanity: for ordinary puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are not imputed to the Prince, but to the lawes and cuſtomes. We ought then to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe,
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:30490:231"/>
that <hi>Manlius</hi> was forced to proceed ſo roughly, by his own extraordinary commands, whereunto his own nature was inclinable, which are very uſeful in a Commonwealth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they reduce the orders thereof to their originals and ancient vigor. And if a Republike were ſo fortunate, that ſhe often had (as we have formerly ſaid) ſome one by his example to renew and revive the Laws, and not retain them onely from running to ruine, but draw them quite back to their beginnings, ſhe might be perpetual. So that <hi>Manlius</hi> was one of thoſe, who by the rigor of his commands main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the military diſcipline in Rome, drawn thereunto firſt by his own nature, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards from a deſire which he had that that ſhould be obſerved, which his natural inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had made him ordain. On the other ſide <hi>Valerius</hi> might as he pleaſed proceed with cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie, as he, whom it ſufficed, that the accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med orders were obſerved in the Romane Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: which cuſtome (becauſe it was good) was enough to honor him, and yet not painful to obſerve; nor did it force <hi>Valerius</hi> to puniſh the offenders, as well becauſe it may be there were none, as for that if there had been any, they imputed (as it is ſaid) their puniſhments to the wonted orders and cuſtomes, and not to the Princes cruelty. So that <hi>Valerius</hi> had pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to cauſe all humanity and mildneſs to fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>w from himſelf, whereby he might eaſily gain his ſouldiers good wills. Whereupon it came to paſs that the one or the other having the ſame obedience, were able, though proceeding diverſly, to work the ſame effect. They that would follow theſe, may chance to fall into thoſe vices of contempt and hatred, as I ſaid in
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:30490:232"/>
my diſcourſe before of <hi>Hanaibal</hi> and <hi>Scipio,</hi> which is avoided by an exceſſive worth in thee, and not otherwiſe. It remains now that we conſider which of theſe ways of proceeding is the more commendable: which I take to be a matter diſputable, becauſe as well the one as other is much prais'd by writers. Yet they that write how a Prince ſhould rule his ſubjects, come nearer to <hi>Valerius</hi> then <hi>Manlius.</hi> And <hi>Xenophon,</hi> alledged formerly by me, giving ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny examples of <hi>Cyrus</hi> his humanity, accords much with that which <hi>T.

manner <hi>T. Livius</hi> ſpeaks honorably of <hi>Manlius,</hi> ſhewing that his ſeverity in putting his ſon to death, made the Army ſo obedient to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul, that it was a cauſe the Romans gain'd the victory of the Latines: and he proceeds ſo far in commending him, that after this victory, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſet down all the order of the battel, and ſhewed all the dangers which the people of Rome ran, and the difficulties there were to overcome, he concludes thus, that onely <hi>Manlius</hi> his valour gave the Romans that victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And comparing the forces of the two Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies together, affirms, that that ſide would have overcome, which ſoever had had <hi>Manlius</hi> for their Conſul. So that conſidering all that writers ſpeak hereof, it would be hard to give a good judgement hereupon. Nevertheleſs, not to leave this part undecided, I ſay, that in a Citizen living under the laws of a Republike, it is more laudable and leſs dangerous to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed as <hi>Manlius</hi> did; for that way is wholly in favour of the publike, and no whit regards private ambition; for by ſuch a courſe a man cannot gain any partiſans, ſhewing himſelf rigid to every one, favoring onely the common good: for no man behaving himſelf thus, can get any particular friends, which we term (as it was ſaid before) Partiſan. In ſo much that a like manner of proceeding can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be more profitable nor more approved in a Republike: the publike advantage no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing failing in it, and being impoſſible to give thereby any jealouſie of private am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition. But in the courſe <hi>Valerius</hi> tooke it is contrary; for, however that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the publike, the ſame effects are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd, yet there ariſe many doubts, by reaſon
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:30490:233"/>
of the particular good will, which this man gaines of his ſoldiers, which in a long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of government might much wrong the common liberty. And if in publike there grew no miſchief hereupon, the reaſon was, becauſe the Romans minds as yet were not corrupted, nor he long continued in his command. But if we are to conſider a Prince as <hi>Xenophon</hi> does, we muſt wholly take to <hi>Valerius,</hi> and leave <hi>Manlius:</hi> for a Prince ought in his ſoldiers and ſubjects aim at love and obedience: that he maintains the old orders, and is eſteemed ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, will yeeld him obedience: and love his affability, humanity, his pity and thoſe other indowments <hi>Valerius</hi> had, which <hi>Xenophon</hi> alſo writes were in <hi>Cyrus:</hi> for to be a Prince well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willed in particular, and to have his whole Army as particularly affected to him, agrees well with all other parts of his ſtate. But in a Citizen, having an Army ſo to take part with him, this part agrees not with the reſt, which are to oblige him to live under the Laws, and obey the Magiſtrates. We read among the ancient ſtories of the Venetian Republike, how that the Galleys of Venice being returned home, and a difference ariſing between them of the Gallies and the people, whereby an uprear and tumult was raiſed, nor could the matter be quieted by force of officers, reverence of Citizens, nor fear of the principal Magiſtrates, of a ſudden when <hi>Peter Loredanus</hi> ſhewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to thoſe Mariners, who the year before had been their Commander, for love of him they departed and left the fight. Which obedience. begot ſuch a ſuſpition in the Senate, that a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while after the Venerians either by im<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

him. I conclude therefore that <hi>Valerius</hi> his manner of proceeding is profitable in a Prince, and hurtful in a Citizen, not onely to his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, but to himſelf: to his country, becauſe thoſe courſes prepare a way to tyranny: to himſelf; for when his country is ſuſpicious of his proceedings, it is conſtrained to make ſure of him with his damage.

and commanding his Armies. That which got him hatred, was, that he was more fevere in chaſtiſing then liberal in rewarding them. And <hi>Titus Livius</hi> alledges theſe occaſions of this hatred. The firſt was, that the monies which were made of the ſale of the Veientes goods, he brought all into the treaſury, and divided not together with the ſpoile among the ſoldiers. The ſecond, that in his triumph he made his triumphal Chariot be drawn with four white horſes, where they ſaid that in his pride he ſtrove to equal the Sun. The third, that he made a vow to give <hi>Apollo</hi> the tenth part of the prey taken from the Veientes, which (he deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to pay his vow) was to be taken out of the ſoldiers hands, who already had got poſſeſſion of it.

                     <argument>
                        <p>The continuation of governments brought Rome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thraldom.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IF we conſider well the proceedings of the Roman Republike, we ſhall ſee that two things were the cauſe of that Republikes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution: the one was contentions which grew upon the Agrarian law; the other was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation of governments. Which things had they been well ſeen into in the beginning, and due remedies applied thereto, their free ſtate would have laſted longer, and probably have been leſs turbulent. And however, that as for the prolonging of any charge we ſee not that in Rome any tumult was raiſed, yet in effect we ſee how much that authority hurt the City, which the Citizens took upon them by ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees. And if the other Citizens, whoſe magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracies were prorogued, had been wiſe and vertuous, as <hi>L. Quintius,</hi> this inconvenient would never have fallen out, whoſe goodneſs in one example is remarkable: for there being an agreement made between the Commons and the Senate, and the Commons having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed the Tribunes charges for one year, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them able to reſiſt the Nobilities ambition, the Senate would for ſtrife ſake, with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and not to ſeem of leſs power then they, prologue <hi>T. Quintius</hi> his Conſulſhip: who abſolutely denyed this determination of theirs, ſaying, that they ſhould endeavor to blot out and cancell evil examples, rather then increaſe their number with another evil one; and ſo would needs have them
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:30490:235"/>
make new Conſuls. Which goodneſs and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom had it been in all the Cities of Rome, it would never have ſuffered the introducing of that cuſtome, to prolong magiſtracies: and from thence they would not have proceeded to the continuation of Commands over Armies, which thing at length ruined that Republike. The firſt who had his command continued to him, was <hi>P. Philo,</hi> who being incamped before the City of Palepolis, and his Conſulſhip coming to an end, the Senate thinking he had need upon gotten the victory, ſent him no ſucceſſor, but made him Proconſul, ſo that he was the firſt Proconſul. Which thing (though pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by the Senate for the publike good) was that which in time brought Rome into bondage: for the further abroad the Romans went with their Armies, the more thought they ſuch prorogation neceſſary; and the more they uſed it; which thing produced two incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences; the one that a ſmaller number of men were imployed and practiſed in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands: and by this the reputation hereof came to be reſtrained to a few: the other was, that one Citizen continuing long time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of an Army, got it to himſelf, and made it of his own faction. For that Army in time forgot the Senate, and took him only for their head. Hereby it came that <hi>Sylla</hi> and <hi>Marius</hi> could finde ſoldiers that would take their parts againſt the Publike. By theſe means could <hi>Caeſar</hi> make himſelf Lord of his native country. Yet if the Romans had not prolonged theſe magiſtracies and commands, they had never ſo quickly attained ſo great power: and had their conqueſts been more ſlow, they would not ſo ſoon have faln into ſervitude.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>WEE have otherwhere diſcourſed, that the moſt profitable ordinance that can be made in a free State, is, that the Citizens be kept bare and poore. And however in <hi>Rome</hi> it appears not what order that was which wrought this effect (eſpecially conſidering the <hi>Agrarian</hi> law had ſuch oppoſition) never theleſs it was ſeen by experience, that four hundred years after <hi>Rome</hi> was built, there was very great poverty: nor is it credible, that other greater order produc'd this effect, than to ſee, that poverty was no bar to any preferment whatſoever, or any honor, and that they went to find out vertue in what cottage ſoever ſhe dwelt. Which manner of living made people leſs covet wealth. This appears plain, becauſe when <hi>Minutius</hi> the Conſul beſieged with his Army by the <hi>Equi, Rome</hi> was exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly afraid, leaſt that Army ſhould be loſt, ſo that they created a Dictator, being the laſt recourſe they had in their difficulties, and this was <hi>L. Quintius Cincinnatus,</hi> who at that time was in his little Country farm, which he then manured with his own hands. <note place="margin">Operae pretium eſt audire qui iomnia bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mana prae divitiis ſpernunt, re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Cincinnatus</hi> was then at plough in his Country Village, which exceeded not the quantity of four acres of ground, when from <hi>Rome</hi> Deputies were ſent him by the Senate to let him know the election of his Dictatourſhip, and to ſhew him in what dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the Commonwealth then was. Hee then having taken to him his gown, came to <hi>Rome,</hi> and levied an Army, and went thence and deliverd <hi>Minutius;</hi> and having broken and deſpolyed the enemies, and ſet him free, would not permit that the beſieged Army ſhould par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the prey, ſaying theſe words, I will not allow thou ſhouldſt partake of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

He had made <hi>L. Tarquinius</hi> General of his horſe, who out of meer poverty ſerved afoot. It is obſervable (as is ſaid) what honour they did unto poverty, and how that to a good and worthy man four acres of land were ſufficient to maintain him. Which poverty we ſee that it was alſo in the dayes of <hi>Marcus Regulus:</hi> for being with the Armies in <hi>Affrica,</hi> he asked the Senate leave, he might turne to his Country farme, which was ſpoyled by his husbandmen.

The other is to conſider the generous
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:30490:236"/>
rage of thoſe Citizens, who when they were made Commanders of an Army, exceeded any Prince in magnanimity of ſpirit, they valued neither Kings nor Commonwealths, nothing affrighted or terrified them; and afterwards when they were returned to live private men, became parſimonious, humble, and men that themſelves husbanded and took pains in manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their own ſmall poſſeſſions, obedient to the Magiſtrates, reverencing their ſuperiors, ſo that it ſeems impoſſible that the ſame mind could endure ſuch change. This poverty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued yet till the days of <hi>Paulus Emilius,</hi> which were in a manner the laſt happy daies of that Republick, where a Citizen who by his tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph enrich'd <hi>Rome,</hi> notwithſtanding kept himſelf very poor. And moreover, ſo much was poverty in eſteem, that <hi>Paulus</hi> for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of behaving himſelf bravely in the war, gave a ſilver cup to a ſon-in-law of his; which was the firſt peece of Plate he ever had in his houſe.

                     <p>THere fell out in the City of <hi>Ardea</hi> between the Nobles and the Commons a debate by reaſon of an alliance: where a young woman that was an heire being as yet to marry, one of the Commons and one of the Nobles woed her at the ſame time, and ſhe having no Father alive, her Tutors deſired to beſtow her on the <hi>Plebeyan,</hi> and her Mother on the Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: whereupon ſuch a tumult was rais'd, that they came to blowes, where the Nobility was in armes in favour of the Nobleman, and the Commons in favour of the <hi>Plebeyan,</hi> ſo that the Commons having the worſe, went out of <hi>Ardea,</hi> and ſent for ayd to the <hi>Volſci,</hi> and the Nobles ſent to <hi>Rome.</hi> The <hi>Volſci</hi> were there firſt, and as ſoon as they arrived they ſat down before <hi>Ardea.</hi> The <hi>Romans</hi> came afterwards upon them, and incloſed the <hi>Volſci</hi> between the Town and them, ſo that they forc'd them (brought to it by famine) to yeeld to their diſcretion. And the <hi>Romans</hi> entring into <hi>Ardea,</hi> and putting to death the principals of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, accorded all the matters of that City. In this text are many things to be obſerved. Firſt we ſee, that women have been the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of many deſtructions, and have brought great miſchiefes upon the Governors of Cities, and have cauſed many diſſentions in them. And (as it hath been already ſeen in this our Story) that exceſs committed againſt <hi>Lucretia</hi> loſt the

I ſay then, that abſolute Princes, and Governors of Commonwealths are to take no ſmaller care hereof, but ought well conſider the diſorders, which may grow upon ſuch an accident, and remedy it in time, ſo that the remedy be neither with the hurt, nor diſgrace of their ſtate, or Commonwealth, as it befell the <hi>Ardeates,</hi> who for having ſuffered that difference to increaſe among Citizens, came to take part with their ſeveral tactions: and when they would have reunited them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, were forc'd to ſend for forrain ayds, which is the beginning of a ſervitude at hand.

are to be compoſed in a City at variance; which is no other, nor can otherwaies be held, then by putting to death the chief ringleaders of ſeditions: for of neceſſity one of theſe three waies is to be goneeither to put them to death, as they did, or remove them out of the City, or cauſe them to make peace one with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, with aſſurance given not to wrong either the other. Of theſe three waies this laſt is the moſt pernicious, leſs certain, and moſt unprofitable: for it is unpoſſible, where much blood hath been ſhed, and other like outrages, that a peace made by force ſhould continue, looking one another in the face every day: and it is very hard for them to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear injuring one another, being there may every day be given amongſt them by reaſon of their dayly converſation new occaſions of quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels.

But becauſe ſuch like execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have ſome thing in them of greatneſs of ſpirit and magnanimity, a feeble Republick knows not how to put them in practiſe, but is ſo far there from, that hardly arrives ſhe to uſe the ſecond remedy. And theſe are ſome of thoſe errors, of which I ſpake in the beginning, that the Princes of our times commit, being to give their judgements in matters of weight: for they ſhould have a mind to ſe, how they have carried themſelves, who of old have deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verd their opinions in like caſes. But the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of men now a daies, cauſed by their weak education, and their little knowledge of things makes them eſteem thoſe opinions of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents partly in human, partly impoſſible. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they have certain of their moderne opinions, quite contrary to the truth, as is that, where the wiſe man of our City a while agoe ſaid, it was neeedfull to hold <hi>Piſtoia</hi> by factions; and <hi>Piſa</hi> with Cittadells: nor perceive they how unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable the one and the other of theſe things is. I will paſs over the Cittadels, becauſe former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wee ſpake of them at large, &amp; now diſcourſe of the incommodity that ariſes from holding the Towns thou haſt under thy government, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into factions. And touching the former, it is impoſſible thou canſt maintain both thoſe ancient factions, Prince or Republick thou art that governſt them: for by nature men are inclined to take part in any thing that is divided, and to be pleaſed more with this than with that; ſo that the having a faction in that Town diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented with thee, is a cauſe that the firſt war that comes, thou loſeſt it: for it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to guard a City, that hath enemies without dors, &amp; within dores. If it be a Republick that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernes
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:30490:239"/>
this City, there is no readier way to make thy Subjects become nought, and to ſet thy City at variance, than by having in thy do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions a Town thus at odds; for each faction ſeeks favour, and each part ſtrives to gain friends by all manner of corruption, ſo that two very great inconveniences ariſe thereupon: the one is, that thou canſt never make them thy friends, becauſe thou canſt not well govern them, the rule ofttimes varying, ſometimes with the one humor, ſometimes with the other: the other is, that that favouring of ſides muſt needs divide thy Republick. And <hi>Blondus</hi> ſpeaking of the <hi>Florentines,</hi> and the <hi>Piſtoyeſes,</hi> tells us certainly, that while the <hi>Florentines</hi> thought to reconcile thoſe of <hi>Piſtoya,</hi> they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided themſelves. Whereupon wee may eaſily perceive the evill which grows upon this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion. In the yeare 1501. when <hi>Aretium</hi> was loſt, and the whole vale of <hi>Tiber,</hi> and that of <hi>Chiana</hi> was taken by the <hi>Vitelli</hi> and the Duke <hi>Valentine,</hi> there came a Gentleman call'd <hi>de Lant,</hi> ſent by the King of <hi>France,</hi> to cauſe a reſtitution of all thoſe Towns loſt to the <hi>Florentines</hi> again: and this <hi>de Lant</hi> finding in every one of thoſe Fortreſſes men, who when they came to viſit him, told him they were of the faction of <hi>Marzocco,</hi> he much blamd their diviſion, ſaying that if in <hi>France</hi> one of the Kings Subjects ſhould ſay hee were of the Kings party, he would be puniſhed: becauſe ſuch a ſpeech could ſignifie no leſs, than that there in the Country were people enemies to the King, whereas that King will that all thoſe Towns be his friends, united in themſelves, and without factions. But all theſe waies, &amp; opinions diſſerting from the truth, ariſe from the weakneſs of
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:30490:239"/>
thoſe that are Princes, who ſeeing they are not able to hold their States by force and valour, betake themſelves to ſuch like devices, which ſometimes when things are in quietneſs helpe ſomewhat; but if they come to any diſtreſs, and that they have warrs, they quickly ſhew them what little truſt thereis to be had in them.</p>

                        <p>That the Citizens actions ought to be well weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: for many times under vertuous and charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deeds are laid the foundations of a Tyranny.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THe City of <hi>Rome</hi> being much oppreſſed by famine, and the publick proviſions unſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to eaſe it, one <hi>Spurius Melius</hi> had a mind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very rich in thoſe times, out of his private eſtate to make proviſion of Gorn, and feed the common people to their content. Whereupon the people flocked ſo thick about him in favour of him, that the Senate perceiving the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient that grew upon this his liberality, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it before it took better hold, created a Dictatour, and ſet him on his back, who put him to death. Here is to be noted, that many times thoſe works which ſeem to be done upon cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and piety, and no way with reaſon to be condemn'd, prove very pernicious and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, when they are not looked to in good time. And to argue this matter more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, I ſay that a Republick cannot ſubſiſt, nor in, any caſe be well govern'd without Citizens of good credit and reputation. On the other ſide the Citizens reputation, is the occaſion of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny in a Commonwealth. And if we will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate this matter, it muſt ſo be order'd, that the Citizens ſtand upon ſuch manner of repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:30490:240"/>
as may advantage and not endammage the City, nor the liberty thereof. And therefore the means are to be examin'd, whereby they gain reputation, which in effect are two, either publick or private. The publick means are, when one by adviſing well, and doing better for the publick benefit, gains reputation. To this honour the way ſhould be ſet open to the Citizens, and rewards given, as well for good advices, as good actions, ſo that they are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both to be honoured and ſatisfied: for when theſe reputations are gotten by theſe plain and honeſt courſes, they will never prove dangerous. But when they are gain'd by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular waies (which is the other means by us alleadged before) they are very dangerous and hurtfull. The private waies are the benefiting this and that other particular, lending monies, matching with their daughters, protecting them againſt the magiſtrates, and doing them ſuch other like favours, which make men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come factions, and encourage him that is thus favour'd by them, to think he may be able to corrupt the publick, &amp; violate the laws. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought a Republick that is well ordered, give eaſy acceſs to thoſe that ſeek favour by publick means, but bar out thoſe that work by their own private by waies, as Rome did, we ſee. For in reward of him that did the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick goood ſervice, ſhe ordain'd their triumphs and all thoſe other honors, which ſhe beſtowed on her Citizens: and to puniſh thoſe, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der diverſe colours aſpired to greatneſs by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate waies, ſhe appointed the publick accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: and when theſe would not ſerve, becauſe the people was blinded with the ſhew of a falſe good, ſhe created a Dictator, who by a Kinglike
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:30490:240"/>
power ſhould reduce thoſe into their rankes again that were broken out, as ſhe did to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh <hi>Spurius Melius.</hi> And when one of theſe things is left unpuniſhed, it is of force to ruine a Republick; for hardly upon ſuch an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may ſhe afterwards be brought into the right way again.</p>

                        <p>That the peoples faults grow firſt from their Princes.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>PRinces have no reaſon to complain of any fault, which the people that is under their governments do commit: for their faults muſt needs proceed either from their negligence, or becauſe they are blemiſhed with the like errors. And whoever ſhall run over the nations that in our dayes have been accounted full of rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries, and ſuch like offences, ſhall perceive they all wholly proceeded from thoſe that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd them who were of the like condition. In <hi>Romania</hi> thoſe Princes in it before they were extinguiſh'd by Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the ſixth, gave patterns to every one of a moſt ungodly and unconſcionable life: for here a man might ſee horrible executions upon every ſlight occaſion, and exceeding great rapines: Which firſt grew from the wickedneſs of thoſe Princes, not from the miſcheivous diſpoſition of the people, as they ſaid: for thoſe Princes being but poor, and yet having a mind to live as ſtately as thoſe that were rich, were neceſſitated to apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to many rapins, and to practiſe them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:30490:241"/>
waies, and among other diſhoneſt waies they toook, this was one; they made lawes and forbad ſome kind of action to be done; afterwards they were the firſt that gave the occaſion to break it, nor ever puniſh'd they the breakers of it, till afterwards when they ſaw many others had committed the ſame fault, and then they began to puniſh the breach, not for any zeal towards the law made, but for covetouſneſs to recover the penalty: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon grew many inconvenients: and above all this, that the people were impoveriſh'd, and no way amended, and thoſe that were impoveriſh'd uſed all their wits to work upon thoſe that were their inferior. Whereupon aroſe all theſe evils (we have now ſpoken of) whereof the Prince was the only cauſe. And that this is true, <hi>T.

                        <p>A Citizen, that will of his own authority do any good work in his own City, of neceſſity muſt firſt extinguiſh all envy; and what order is to be given for the defence of a City upon the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies approach.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THe Romane Senate having notice, that all Tuſcany had made a new levy of ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, with purpoſe to endammage Rome, and that the Latini and Hernici, who formerly had been their friends, were now joyned to the Volſoi, the perpetual enemies of Rome, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that this war might prove perillous. And <hi>Camillus</hi> at that time being Tribune with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſular power, thought all might be well done without creating a Dictator, if the other Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes his collegues would yeeld up unto him the ſum and whole command of the Empire, which the ſaid Tribunes willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did. <hi>Nor thought they (ſays</hi> T.

                        <hi>it any thing derogated from their Majeſty, what they had yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Camillus</hi> having taken this obedience upon their words, commanded they ſhould inroll three Armies. Of the firſt he would be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to go againſt the Tuſcans; Of the ſecond he
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:30490:242"/>
made <hi>Quintus Servilius</hi> Conmander, whom he would have to abide near about Rome, to withſtand the <hi>Latini</hi> and the <hi>Hernici,</hi> if they ſhould ſtir. He gave <hi>Lucius Quintius</hi> the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the third Army, which he levied for the guard of the City, the defence of the gates and the court of juſtice, in caſe any chance ſhould happen; beſides this he ordained, that <hi>Horatius</hi> one of his Collegues, ſhould make proviſion of arms and corn and other things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite in time of war. He made <hi>Cornelius</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo his Collegue chief of the Senate, and over the publike Councel, to conſult upon thoſe things which in general were to be executed. Thus were the Tribunes in thoſe times diſpoſed for the good of their Country to command, and to obey. It is noted by the text here, what a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and prudent man may do, and what great good he may becauſe of, and how much he may be able to advantage his country, when by means of his goodneſs and vertue, he hath quite extinguiſhed all envy, which many times is the cauſe that men cannot effectuate a good work, the ſaid envy not allowing them that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which it is neceſſary they ſhould have in matters of importance. And this envy is quite put out two ways; either by ſome ſtrong and difficult accident, where every one ſeeing themſelves ready to periſh, laying ambition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, willingly run to obey him, whom they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve by his vertue able to deliver them, as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell <hi>Camillus:</hi> who having given ſo many proofs of his being an admirable man, and having been thrice Dictator, and performed that place al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes with the advantage of the publike, and no way to his own profit, had now cauſed men
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:30490:242"/>
not to be afraid of his greatneſs And becauſe he was ſo magnanimous, and of ſuch great cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, they thought it no ſhame to them to be inferiors to him: And therefore ſaies <hi>Titus Livius</hi> very wiſely theſe words, <hi>Nor thought they it any things, &amp;c.</hi> Another way is envy blotted out, when either by violence or by courſe of nature they dye that have been thy competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors in attaining to any reputation, or great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; who ſeeing the more eſteemed then they, it is unpoſſible they ever ſhould be at reſt, or have any patience. And when they are accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to live in a corrupted City, where their education hath not bred any goodneſs in them, it is unpoſſible, let what accident will fall out, that they ſhould ever go back from any thing; and without doubt to have their wills, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy the waywardneſs of their minds, they would be contented even to ſee the ruine of their native Country. To overcome this envy, there is no other remedy but the death of thoſe that bear it: and when fortune is ſo favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to that vertuous man, as that thoſe men dye a natural death, he becomes glorious with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving any ſcandal, when without any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle or offence he may diſplay his vertues. But when he hath not this good luck, he muſt deviſe by any means to take them out of his way. And before he can do any thing he muſt practiſe thoſe wayes whereby to overcome this difficulty. And he that reads the Bible with underſtanding, ſhall ſee that <hi>Moſes</hi> was forced (if he would have his lawes and ordinances proceed) to put a great number of men to death, who provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked by nothing elſe but envy, withſtood his
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:30490:243"/>
purpoſe. This neceſſity <note place="margin">I deubt that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding which he adviſes others of, he wants himſelf: not knowing the meaning of, or not believing the holy writ; whereby he puts men paſt ſuſpition of his Atheiſme. For what he alledges of <hi>Moſes,</hi> he muſt needs take originally from <hi>Moſes</hi> his books, being we have not any author of that antiquity, as could write any thing of his own knowledge touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe times. But thoſe <hi>Mach.</hi> ſeems not to believe further then ſerved his own humor, reading the Scriptures onely to a politicke end, not ſo much for the ſtrengthening of his belief, as the better<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his diſcourſe.

As in the rebellion of <hi>Corah</hi> and his complices, <hi>Numbers the 16.

<pb n="449" facs="tcp:30490:243"/>
of Florence knew it alſo. The one could not overcome it, becauſe he had not power to do it, which was the Fryar, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was not well underſtood by thoſe that followed him who might have had power to have done it. But it was not his fault, and his ſermons are full of the blames he lays upon the wiſe men of the world, and of invectives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them; for ſo he terms thoſe envious men, and all that oppoſed his ordinances. That o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers believed that in time, by his goodneſs, and good fortune, and doing good turns to ſome of them, quite to extinguiſh this envy, ſeeing himſelf young enough too, and then wearing ſo many new favors, which the manner of his proceeding afforded him, ſo that he thought he was able to overcome thoſe many that envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly oppoſed him, without any ſcandal, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, or tumult. And did not know that time cannot ſtay; goodneſs is not ſufficient, fortune changes; and there is no gift can appeaſe malice. So that the one and the other of theſe two went to ruine, and their ruine proceeded either from their ignorance, or their diſability to overcome this envy. The other thing remarkeable is the order which <hi>Camillus</hi> took both within and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad for the preſervation of Rome. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed not without reaſon the good Hiſtorians (as ours here is) ſet down particularly and
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:30490:244"/>
diſtinctly certain caſes, to the end poſterity ſhould learn how in the like accidents they are to defend themſelves. And it ought well be obſerv'd in this text, that there is not a more dangerous nor unprofitable defence then that which is confuſedly made, and with out order, and this appears by this third army which <hi>Camillus</hi> cauſed to be inrolled, and to be left at <hi>Rome</hi> to guard the Town: for many would have judg'd that part ſuperfluous, where the people is moſt commonly arm'd, and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick; and for this cauſe a man would not think it needfull to have them inroll'd otherwiſe, but only that it ſufficed to cauſe them to be in armes as occaſion ſhould require. But <hi>Camillus</hi> and who elſe were wiſe as he was, think o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, who never allow a multitude to take armes, unleſs by certain order and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Wherefore upon this example, he that is appointed over the guard of a City, ſhould avoid, as a rock, the arming of men in confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but ought firſt have thoſe choſen and regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred? which he would have in armes, and whom he would have them obey, where their rendezvous, and whether to go, and command thoſe that are not inrolled to abide every man at his own houſe, for the ſafeguard thereof. They that ſhal take this order in a City aſſailed, will eaſily be able to defend themſelves: who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever does otherwiſe, ſhal neither imitate <hi>Camil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> nor defend himſelf.</p>

Weake men behave themſelves in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner: for they befoole and beſot them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in good fortune, attributing all the good they have to thoſe vertues which they never knew; whence it proceeds that they grow inſupportable and odious to thoſe that are about them; whereupon depends the ſudden alteration of fortune, which ſo ſoon as they look once in the face, they fall preſently into the other defect, and become vile and abject. From hence it comes that ſuch manner of of Princes thinke rather in adverſitie how to make an eſcape, than to ſtand upon
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:30490:245"/>
their defence, as thoſe that for having made e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil uſe of good fortune, are not prepared for any kind of ſafegard. This vertue, and this vice, which I ſay, is found in one man alone, we find alſo in a Republike, of which the Romanes and the Venetians ſerve us for example. Thoſe former never any bad fortune could make ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, nor any good fortune inſolent, as it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly appeared after the defeat they had at Canna, and after the victory they got againſt <hi>Antiochus:</hi> for upon that defeat, however a very great one, becauſe it had been the third together, they never grew baſe upon it, but continued to ſend forth Armies; they would not redeem priſoners againſt the orders they had made, nor ſend to <hi>Hannibal</hi> or Carthage to ask peace, but caſting aſide all thoſe unworthy courſes, they thought ſtill upon providing for the war, arming for want of ſouldiers their old men and ſlaves. Which thing being known to <hi>Hanno</hi> the Carthaginian (as was ſaid before) he ſhewed that Senate what ſmall account they were to make of that defeat at Canna. And ſo it appeared, as thoſe hard times did not affright, nor abaſe them, on the other part nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did their more fortunate times puffe them up: for, when <hi>Antiochus</hi> ſent Ambaſſadors to <hi>Scipio</hi> to require an agreement, before they came to joyn battel, or that he had loſt it, <hi>Scipio</hi> gave him certain conditions of peace, which were, that he ſhould retire into Syria, and leave the reſt to the Romans diſpoſing, which <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> refuſing, and coming to battel and loſing it, ſent again his Ambaſſadors to <hi>Scipio,</hi> with order that he would ſubmit to all thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions which the Conqueror ſhould impoſe on him, to whom he propounded no other
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:30490:245"/>
conditions than what he had fomerly offered before the victory, adding theſe words: <hi>That the Romanes if they be overcome, loſe not their courages, nor when they overcome grow they inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.</hi> Clean contrary hereunto we have ſeen the Venetians do: who in their proſperity (thinking they had gotten it by their own va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor which they never were guilty of) grew to ſuch an exceſs of inſolence, that they termed the King of France Saint <hi>Marks</hi> ſon, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned the Church; and their ambition all Italy would not hold, but imagined they were to frame a Monarchy like that of the Romanes. Afterwards their good fortune abandoning them, and that they were a little routed by the King of France at Vayla, they not onely loſt all their State by rebellion, but a good part of it they gave up to the Pope and the King of Spaine, even through meer baſeneſs and cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardiſe. And they became ſo vile and abject, that they ſent Ambaſſadors to the Emperor, to offer themſelves to be his tributaries, and writ letters to the Pope full of baſeneſs and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, whereby to move him to compaſſion. Into which unhappineſs they fell in four days ſpace, and after a half defeat: for their Army come to battel and to fight, in their retreat loſt near one half of their men, yet ſo that one of their Proveditors that eſcaped, came to Verona with above five and twenty thouſand ſouldiers between foot and horſe: in caſe that if either the Venetians, or any of their orders had been of value, they might eaſily have recovered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and looked fortune again in the face, and have been ready either to overcome, or loſe more gloriouſly, or get more honorable terms of agreement: but the baſeneſs of their
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:30490:246"/>
ſpirits cauſed by the quality of their orders, nothing good in matters touching the war, made them at once loſe both their State and courage. And ſo will it alwaies befall any that ſhall behave themſelves as they did: for this growing inſolent in good fortune, and abject in evill, ariſes from the manner of thy proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and from the education wherein thou haſt been traind up: Which when it is weak &amp; vain, makes thee like to it ſelf, when otherwiſe it caſts thee in another manner of mould, and makes thee know the world better, rejoycing leſs at the good beſalls thee, as alſo grieving leſs at the evill comes upon thee: and that which is ſaid of one man alone, is ſaid alſo of many that live in the ſame Commonwealth, who attain to that perfection, which the order and manner of government thereof wil afford. And though otherwhere we have ſaid, that the foundation of all States is good military diſcipline; and where this is not, there can neither be good lawes, nor any other thing good, methinks it is not more than needs to repeate it again; for to many purpoſes, in the reading of this Story, wee ſee this neceſſity ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares, and wee ſee that neither can the ſoldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers be good, unleſs they be traind and practis'd, nor can they be train'd, unleſs compos'd of thy own ſubjects: for the wars do not alwaies laſt, &amp; unpoſsible it is they ſhould: therefore is it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be able to practiſe this military exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe in time of peace; neither can this exerciſe be us'd in regard of the expence, with others then with thy own ſubjects. <hi>Camillus</hi> was gone (as we ſaid before) with the Army againſt the <hi>Tuſcans,</hi> and his ſouldiers ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ving ſeen the greatneſs of the enemies Army were

And truely when any one deſires that a people or Prince ſhould wholly take their minds off from agreement, there is no truer nor certainer way than to make them do ſome foul act againſt him, with whom thou wouldſt not have the accord made. For the fear of that puniſhment which he ſhall think he hath deſerved for his fault, ſhall always keep him off. After the firſt wars which the Carthaginians had with the Romanes, thoſe ſoldiers who had ſerved the Carthaginians in that war in Sicily and Sardinia, when the peace was concluded, went back into Affrica, where not being ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied for their pay, they made wars againſt

thoſe Soldiers that have been borne and liv'd together.

                        <p>What fame, report, or opinion cauſes the people to begin to caſt their favours upon a Citizen: and whether a Prince or a people do beſtow their Magiſtracies with better judgement.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>OTherwhere we ſaid, that <hi>T. Manlius,</hi> who afterwards was termed <hi>Torquatus,</hi> ſav'd <hi>L. Manlius</hi> his Father from an acccuſation,
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:30490:249"/>
which <hi>M. Pomponions</hi> Tribune of the people had made againſt him. And however the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſaving him, was ſomewhat violent and extraordinary, yet that filial piety towards his Father, was ſo acceptable to the generall, that it was not only not blamed, but when Tribune were to be appointed over the Legions, <hi>T. Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> was choſen in the ſecond place. Upon which ſucceſs, I beleeve it fit to conſider, what way the people take to give their judgements upon men in diſtributing of their charge that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may ſee, whether that be true which we formerly concluded, that the people is a better diſtributer than a Prince. I ſay then, that the people in their diſtribution follows the report that goes of one by publick voyce and fame: when they know him not otherwiſe by his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary behaviour, or by preſumption or opinion conceived of him. Which two things have been cauſed either by the Fathers of ſuch, who for that they have been great perſonages, and of ability in the Cities, it is thought their ſons ſhould be like them, untill by their actions the contrary be found: Or elſe it is cauſed by the courſes ſuch a one takes, of whom we ſpeak: the beſt courſes and waies that can be held, are to keep company with grave men, well dispos'd, and ſuch as by every one are reputed wiſe. And becauſe there cannot be a greater marke or diſcovery of a man then by the company he frequents, without queſtion he that uſes good company, gaines a good name: for it is impoſſible but that he ſhall much reſemble them. Or indeed this publick reputation is gotten by ſome extraordinary and notable exploit, however private, that hath proved in thy hands very honorable. And of
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:30490:250"/>
all theſe three things, which in the beginning gain any one a good reputation, nothing gives if more amply then this laſt: for that firſt of parents, and fathers is ſo deceitfull, that men advance therein very leiſurely, and that is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently quite ſpent, when it is not accompanied by the the proper vertue of him that is to be cenſured. The ſecond way, which makes thee be known by the company thou uſeſt, is better then the firſt; but is much inferior to the third; for untill thou haſt given evidence of thy ſelf by ſome worthy exploir, thy repute is wholly grounded upon opinion, which is very eaſily cancelled. But that third being begun and grounded upon thy workes, gives thee at firſt ſuch renown, that needs muſt it be, that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thou commit many acts contrary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, if thou wouldſt diſannul it. Therefore ought thoſe men that ſpring up in a Common-wealth, take this courſe, and indeavour by ſome extraordinary act to begin their riſe. Which many at <hi>Rome</hi> did in their youths, either by publiſhing of a law, furthering the common good, or by accuſing ſome potent Citizen as a breaker of the laws, by doing ſuch like nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things, and unwonted, whereof men ſhould have occaſion to ſpeak afterwards. Neither are ſuch like things needfull only to begin ones reputation, but they are as neceſſary for the maintenance and advancement of it. And to do this, a man had need to renew them again, as <hi>Manlius</hi> did during his whole life: for when he had defended his father ſo vertuouſly and beyond the ordinary ſtrain, and by this action taken his firſt degree of reputation, after ſome years he fought with that Frenchman, and took from him that chain of gold, which gave him
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:30490:250"/>
the name of <hi>Torquatus:</hi> nor ſtay'd he upon this, but afterwards in riper years he put his ſon to death for having fought without his allowance, however he had vanquiſhed his enemy. Which three actions gave him a greater name, and throughout all ages make him more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, then ever any triumph or victory did, wherewith he was adorn'd as much as any other <hi>Roman.</hi> And the reaſon is, becauſe in thoſe victories <hi>Manlius</hi> had very many like him, but in theſe particulars he had either very few or none. <hi>Scipio</hi> the elder got not greater glory by all his triumphs, then that action of defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his father upon the <hi>Teſin</hi> gained him in his youth, and that other when after the defeate at <hi>Canna,</hi> couragiouſly with his ſword drawn he made many young <hi>Romans</hi> ſwear they would never abandon <hi>Italy,</hi> as already then among them it was reſolv'd which two actions were the beginnings of his reputation, which made him a way to his triumphs of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> which opinion of him was alſo increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, when he ſent back the daughter to her Father, and the wife to her husband in <hi>Spain.</hi> This manner of proceeding is not alone need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for thoſe Citizens, that would gain reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereby to attain the dignities in their Commonwealth, but is alſo neceſſary for Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to maintain their credits in their Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities: for nothing gives them ſo great eſteem as to yeeld ſome rare examples of themſelves, by ſome deed or pithy ſaving, agreeable with the common good, which may evidently prove the Prince either magnanimous, or liberall, or juſt; and that he is ſuch a one, that his life may ſerve for a patterne, and his wiſe ſayings may be uſed by his ſubjects as proverbs. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne,
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:30490:251"/>
whereat we began this diſcourſe, I ſay' that the people, when they begin to confer any dignity upon one of their Citizens, ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon any of thoſe reaſons before alledged, take no ill ground; but when afterwards the frequent examples of one mans good carriage makes him better known, then is a better ground taken; for in ſuch caſe there can never fall any deceit. I ſpeak only of thoſe honours which are given to men in the beginning, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they be well known by a certain experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or that they tranſgreſs from one action to another unlike it; Where both touching the ſalfe opinion and the corruption, they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies commit leſs errors, then Princes. And becauſe it may fall out, that the people might be deceived in the report, in the opinion, and actions of a man, conceiving them greater then in truth they are, which would not be ſo with a Prince, becauſe it is like it ſhould be told him, or that he ſhould be advertiſed thereof by ſome of his Counſellours; to the end therefore that the people want not theſe advertiſements, the good founders of Republicks have ordained, that when the cheiſeſt dignities of Cities are to be beſtowed, whereunto it might prove dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to prefer unſufficient men, and ſeeing the peoples wills ſometimes bent to advance ſome one unfit, that it may be lawfull for any Citizen, and accounted as an honour to him, to publiſh in their aſſemblies that mans defects, that the people (this notice not failing them) may the better give their judgments thereupon. And that this was cuſtomary at <hi>Rome,</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration which <hi>F. Maximus</hi> made, witneſſed, which he uttered before the people in the ſecond Punicke warr, when at the creation of
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:30490:251"/>
the Conſulls they took a liking to <hi>T. Ottaſilius;</hi> and <hi>Fabius;</hi> deeming him unſufficent to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage the Conſulate in thoſe times, ſpake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, declaring his unſufficiency, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as he hindred him of that dignity, and converted the peoples favours to one that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved it better then he. The people then in the choice of their Magiſtrates judge according to the trueſt markes they can have of men. And when they can be adviſed, as Princes are, they run into fewer errors then Princes; and that Citizen that will begin to ſeek the peoples fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, muſt with ſome notable exploit gain it, as <hi>Titus Manlius</hi> did.</p>

                        <p>What dangers they incurre that put themſelves forwards as principals to adviſe any deſign, which are ſo much the greate, by how much this carries with it the more difficulty and perill.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>HOw dangerous a thing it is for any man to become the ringleader of any new mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which belongs to many, and how hard a thing it is to meddle in it, and bring it on for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and make it good being thus brought forwards, would be too long and too deep a matter to diſcourſe on. Therefore reſerving it for a fitter place, I will only treate of thoſe dangers, which Citizens incur, or thoſe that adviſe a Prince, making themſelves chief in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading him to any weighty and important re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, ſo that the Councell thereof is wholly imputed to them: for, men judging things by
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:30490:252"/>
their events, of all the evill that ariſes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, the blame is wholly laid on him as au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor; and if good come of it, he is commended for it; but the reward comes much ſhort of the loſs is hazarded. This preſent <hi>Sultan Selimus'</hi> ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the great Turk, having made preparation (as ſome report, who now come from his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try) for the Conqueſt of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> was encouraged by one of his Baſhawes, who was then upon the confines of <hi>Perſia,</hi> to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take rather an expedition againſt the Sophy; by whoſe Counſell being perſwaded, he went to that enterpriſe with an exceeding great army, and comming into a very vaſt country, where a great part of it is deſert, and rivers very few, and finding there thoſe difficulties, which long ſince had ruin'd many <hi>Roman</hi> armies, was ſo diſtreſſed thereby, that he loſt there by famine and plague (however that in the war he were the vanquiſher) a great part of his army. Whereupon being errag'd againſt the author of that Counſell, he put him to death. We reade of many Citizens, that were the adviſers to ſuch and ſuch enterpriſes, who becauſe theſe had evill ſucceſs, have ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way been baniſhed. Certain Citizens of <hi>Rome</hi> there were, who as authours of the advice, ſtood to have a Conſul from among the Commons in <hi>Rome;</hi> it happened, that the firſt of them, that went abroad with their armies, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated. Whereupon it had prov'd but unlucki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the authors of that Counſell, had not their party been ſtrong, by whoſe favour ſuch reſolution was taken. It is then moſt certain, that they who adviſe a Republick and they that Counſell a Prince, are equally brought into theſe ſtreights; and if they do not adviſe
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:30490:252"/>
thoſe things, which they take to be profitable either for the City or the Prince without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, they faile of their duties; and in caſe they do counſell them, they run the hazard of their lives, and of their eſtates; all men here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in being ſo blind as to judge advices good or evill by the ſucceſs they take. And deviſing with my ſelf by what means they might eſcape this infamy or danger, I ſee no other way, then that they put things forward moderately, and not take any thing upon them as their own en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe, and give their opinion without paſſion, and defend it alſo modeſtly without paſſion, ſo that if either the City or the Prince follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>that advice. it may ſeem they willingly took that courſe, and were not drawn thereto by thy importunity. When thou doſt ſo, it is not reaſonable that a Prince or a people ſhould ſeek revenge on thee for thy counſell, it being not followed againſt other mens wills: for here the danger is, that many having contradicted thee, in the unhappy ſucceſs of thy advice they will concur in working thy ruine. And if in this caſe, one ſhould ſay, that when he failes of that glory which another gets by being one alone againſt many in adviſing any courſe, when it proves luckily, we meete here with two ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages to countervail it: the firſt is to be quite exempt out of all danger: the ſecond is, if thou adviſeſt any thing modeſtly, and by reaſon of the oppoſition made againſt it, thy Counſell be not taken, and ſome diſaſter fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low upon the advice another hath given, thou gaineſt much glory thereby. And however the glory, which is gotten by miſchiefs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen thy City or thy Prince, cannot well be ſaid to be enjoyed, yet is there ſome account to
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:30490:253"/>
be made of them. I beleeve there is no other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice can be given to men in this part; for the perſwading them to hold their peace, and not give their opinion, would be a thing very unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the Commonwealth and their Princes, &amp; they would hardly be able to eſcape danger; for in a ſmall time would they be ſuſpected; it might alſo befall them, as it did thoſe friends of <hi>Porſe</hi> the King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> who having been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated by <hi>Paulus Emilius,</hi> &amp; flying with a few of his confidents, it chanc'd, that in relating things paſt, one of them began to tell <hi>Perſe</hi> of many errors committed by him, which were the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of his ruine, to whom <hi>Perſe</hi> turning ſaid, Traitor, and haſt thou delay'd to tell me it, untill now that I have no remedy? and upon theſe words ſlew him with his own hand. And thus he ſuffer'd puniſhment for his ſilence when he ſhould have ſpoken, and for having ſpoken when he ſhould have held his peace: neither avoided he the danger, by not giving his advice. Wherefore I beleeve the rules a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove given, are to be kept and obſerv'd.</p>

<pb n="469" facs="tcp:30490:253"/>
of the combat are more then men, and in the end thereof prove leſs then women. And weighing well from whence this may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, many beleeve that naturally they are ſo dispos'd, which I think is true: but hence it followes not that this their naturall humor, which makes them ſo fierce in the beginning, might not be ſo order'd by art, as to continue them fierce till the very concluſion: And for proof hereof, I ſay, that there are armies of three ſorts: the one where there is both fury and order, for from the order ariſes fury and valour, as was that of the <hi>Romans;</hi> for it appears in all their hiſtories, that there was a very good order in that army, which military diſcipline in tract of time had brought in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them. For in a well train'd army, no man is to do any thing but by rule and order. And we find hereby, that in the <hi>Roman</hi> Army (from which, inſomuch as it conquer'd the whole world, all others may take example) they neither ate, nor ſlept, nor bought, neither did they any military action nor domeſtick without the Conſuls order: for thoſe armies which do otherwiſe, are not right armies; and if they come to make any trial of themſelves in any action, they do it by force of rage and violence, and not by valour: but where valour is accompanied with due ordinances, it makes good uſe of the fury in ſuch manner and in ſuch times that no difficulty abates it, nor ever quailes the courage, becauſe thoſe good ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances reinforce the ſpirit, and the fury, both being ſtill maintained by the hope of over com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, which never failes while the orders hold firme. The contrary falls out in thoſe armies wherein is fury and not order, as were thoſe
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:30490:254"/>
of the French, who ever faild by little and little For it proved not, that their firſt aſſault pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, and that their fury whereon they much relied, was not maintained by an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate valour, not having any thing elſe, beſides that, wherein to truſt, as that grew coole, ſo they failed. On the other ſide the <hi>Romans</hi> doubting leſs of dangers by reaſon of their good orders, not diſtruſting the victory, fought reſolutely and obſtinately with the ſame cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and valour as well in the end as in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, or rather enraged by fighting, they grew ſtill more fierce. The third kind of armies is, where there is no naturall fury, nor acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall order, as the Italian armies are in our daies, which are quite unprofitable: and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they incounter with an army which upon ſome accident chances to run away, they ſhall never overcome: and without alledging other examples, we every day ſee that they give good proofes they have no valour at all.

                        <hi>the event of the war, that the French Army leaving their Campe in a fright, went into the Tiburtine Country, and thence into Campania.</hi> For I conſider on the one ſide, that a good Commander ought wholly avoid to do any thing which being but of ſmall moment, may produce but evill effects in his Army: for to begin a skirmiſh or a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate wherein the whole forces are not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, and yet the whole fertune is there laid to ſtake, is a thing ſavouring too much of raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as I ſaid before, when I condemn'd the guarding of the paſſages. On the other ſide I conſider, that wiſe and experienced Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, when they meet with a new enemy, and that is of reputatſon, are forc'd before they come to joyne battell, to cauſe their ſouldiers to make tryall of them by light skirmiſhes, to the end that beginning to know them, and to have to deale with them, they may be rid of that terror which the report and reputation of theſe men have put them in. And this part in a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall is of exceeding great importance; for there is a kind of neceſſity in it, which forceth thee thereunte; for thou wilt think that thou goeſt to thy manifeſt deſtruction, unleſs thou have firſt by theſe ſmall experiences made thy ſoldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers caſt out that terror, which by means of the enemies reputation had poſſeſſed their minds. <hi>Valerius Corvinus</hi> was ſent by the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> with an Army againſt the <hi>Samnites,</hi> who were new enemies, and theſe formerly had never proved the one the others forces, where <hi>T.

So that this is one of thoſe things, which hath the evill ſo near neighbouring unto the good, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are ſo neare joyn'd together, that it is very eaſy to miſtake the one for the other: Whereupon I ſay, that a good Commander ſhould be very careful, that nothing ariſe, which upon any accident may take away the courage and heart of his ſoldiers. That which may be of force to take away their courage, is to begin to loſe: and therefore a man ſhould be well aware of theſe ſmall skirmiſhes, and no way ſuffer any of them, unleſs with exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great advantage, and certain hope of victory. Nor ought he undertake to guard any paſſages, where he cannot bring his whole Army together. Nor ſhould he keep any Towns unleſs it be thoſe that by loſing of them, his utter ruine followes thereupon; and thoſe that he guards, he ſhould take ſuch care both with their defences and alſo with his Army, that whenever the enemy hath any deſign to aſſayle them, he may make uſe of all his forces in reſcue of them: the others he ſhould leave undefended: for whenſoever any thing is loſt, that was before abandon'd, the Army being yet afoot, there is neither the reputation of the war loſt, nor the hope of
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:30490:256"/>
conqueſt. But when any thing is loſt, which thou hadſt purpoſed to defend, and every one beleeve, thou mightſt, defend, there is the dammage and loſs, and there thou haſt in a manner, as thoſe Frenchmen did, by a matter of ſmall moment loſt the whole war. <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon</hi> the Father of <hi>Perſe,</hi> a warlick man, and of great eſteem in his time, being aſſavl'd hy the <hi>Romans,</hi> forſook and laid waſt much of his Country, as he, who becauſe he was wiſe, thought it more pernicious to loſe reputation by not being able to defend that which he undertook to defend, then by leaving it in prey to the enemy, to loſe it as a thing neglected. The <hi>Romans</hi> when after the defeat at <hi>Canna,</hi> their eſtate was in great perplexity, refus'd many that were under their protection, and ſo alſo divers of their own Subjects, charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to defend themſelves the beſt they could, which are better courſes far, than to undertakes defences, and afterwards nor be able to go through with them; for hereby thoſe friends are loſt, and forces only in thoſe friends. But returning to the ſmall skirmiſhes, I ſay; that yet if a Commander be forc'd by reaſon of the newneſs of the enemy to make any skirmiſh, he ought take ſo much advantage in it, that he run no hazard to loſe it, nor do, as <hi>Marius</hi> did, which is the better way. Who going againſt the <hi>Cimbrians,</hi> which were an exceeding fierce people, and came to make a prey of <hi>Italy,</hi> and whereſoever they came, caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a great terror, becauſe of their fierceneſs and multitude, and by reaſon they had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vanquiſh'd a <hi>Roman</hi> Army, <hi>Marius</hi> thought it neceſſary before he came to joyn battell, to worke ſomewhat, which might make his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers

lay aſide that terrour, which the feare of the enemy had put them in; and as a very well advis'd Commander, brought his Army ſeveral times, where the <hi>Cimbrians</hi> with their troupes were to paſs: And thus within the fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his Campe he would that his Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſhould ſee them, and accuſtome their eyes to the view of that enemy, to the end that by ſeeing a diſordinate multitude loaded with baggage and unprofitable armes, and in part too diſarm'd, they might reaſſure themſelves, and grow deſirous of battell, which courſe as it was diſcreetly practis'd by <hi>Marius,</hi> ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ought it be diligently imitated by others, whereby they might not be forc'd to incurre thoſe dangers which I mentioned before, nor to do as the Frenchmen did: <hi>Who for a matter of ſmall moment</hi>

<pb n="477" facs="tcp:30490:257"/>
titles. And from the beginning of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe we may conſider, that if great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders have us'd extraordinary means to confirme the reſolutions of an Army of old ſoldiers, when they were to encounter with unaccuſtomed enemies, how much rather is there pains to be taken with an army of freſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water ſoldiers, who never yet look'd the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in the face for if an unaccuſtomed enemy terrifies an army of old ſoldiers; much more probable is it that any enemy ſhould affright an army of new ſoldiers, Yet we have many times ſeen all theſe difficulties overcome by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great wiſdome of good Commanders, as <hi>Gracchus</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> did and <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <argument>
                        <p>That a Commander ought exactly know ſcituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>AMong other things befitting the General of an Army, is the knowledge of ſcituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and countries; for without this knowledge in general and in particular, the Commander of an Army cannot well effectuate any thing. And becauſe all ſciences, if a man would be exact in them, require practice, this is one that askes exceeding much practice. And this practice or (as I may terme it) particular knowledge is gain'd rather by means of hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, then by any other exerciſe. Wherefore the ancient writers ſay, that thoſe Heroes, that rul'd the world in their days, were brought up in the woods and in frequent hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings: for the chace teacheth thee many things beſides this knowledge, which very much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes the war. And <hi>Xenophon</hi> in <hi>Cyrus</hi> his life ſhewes, that <hi>Cyrus</hi> going to aſſaile the King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> as he gave order for the ſervice, he put his ſouldiers in mind that this was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe then one of thoſe chaces which they had many times made in his company. And he told thoſe he ſent to lie in ambuſh upon the mountains, that they were like unto thoſe that went to pitch their toiles upon the hills, and thoſe that ſcowred the plain; that they were like thoſe that went to put up the beaſt out of his covert, to the end that being chaſed, he fall into the toiles. This is ſaid to ſhew that the chaſe according as <hi>Xenophon</hi> allowes of it,
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:30490:258"/>
hath a kinde of reſemblance of war. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is ſuch exerciſe very honorable and well beſeeming great perſonages. Nor can this knowledge of countries by any fitter means be learned then by way of hunting: for the chace makes him that frequents it know how in particular the country lies where he uſes to hunt; and when a man hath made himſelf well acquainted with the ſcite, of one country, he afterwards with facility comprehends that of all other ſtrange Countries: for every Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and every member of them have ſome kind of conformity one with another, ſo that he who knows the one well, may eaſily attain to the knowledge of the other. But he that hath never practiſed the one, very hardly or never, unleſs it be by long experience, can know the other; whereas he that is well verſed therein, at the firſt caſt of his eye knows how that plane lies, or that hill riſes, how far that vally rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and all ſuch other like things, whereof for the time to come he hath gained a ſettled knowledge. And that this is true, <hi>T. Livius</hi> ſhewes us by the example of <hi>Publius Decius,</hi> who being Tribune of the ſouldiers in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my which <hi>Cornelius</hi> the Conſull led againſt the <hi>Samnites,</hi> when the Conſull was forc'd to betake himſelf to a vally, where the <hi>Romans,</hi> army might eaſily have been incloſed by the <hi>Samnites,</hi> this <hi>Decius</hi> perceiving the danger they were in, ſaid to the Conſul, <hi>Seeſt thou Aulus Cornelius that hill which is</hi>

                        <hi>above the enemy? that is the ſtrength of our hope and ſafety, if we, becauſe the Samnites being
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:30490:259"/>
blinde have neglected it, quickly ſeiſe on it. And before theſe words uttered by</hi> Decius, T. Livius <hi>ſayes,</hi> Publius Decius <hi>the ſouldiers Tribune ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a pretty high hill which lay a little higher then the enemies campe, of hard aſcent to men incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred with compleat armes, but of eaſy acceſs to men lightly harneſſed.</hi> Whereupon being ſent thither himſelf by the Conſull with 3000 ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and having ſav'd the Roman army, and purpoſing when night came, himſelf to depart, and ſo to ſave himſelf and his own ſouldiers, he is brought in thus ſpeaking, <hi>Follow me, that yet while it is day light we may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover what places the enemy guards</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Ite mecum, ut dum lucis aliquid ſupereſt, quibus locis hoſtes praeſidia ponant, qua pateat hinc exitus exploremus.

And when he had once gotten there upon it, having a mind to depart and return again to the Conſul, being invironed round with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, he would never have been able ſo far off to ſpy out the paſſages to eſcape thence, and diſcerne which places were guarded by the enemy, ſo that it muſt be of neceſſity, that <hi>Decius</hi> had a very exact knowledge, whereby he brought it to paſs that by the taking of that

hill, the <hi>Roman</hi> Army was delivered, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he himſelf (being beſieged) knew how to find a way of eſcape both for himſelf and thoſe that were with him.</p>

                     <p>HOwever that the uſe of fraud in any action be deteſtable, yet in the managing of a war it is a thing laudable and glorious, and he is as much praiſe, that vanquiſhes the enemy by deceit, as he that overcomes him by force. And this we ſee, by the judgment of thoſe that write the lives of great perſonages, who commend <hi>Hannibal</hi> and others, who have been very notable in ſuch like ways of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding. Whereof becauſe there are many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples every where obvious, I will not adde any. I will ſay this only, that I mean not, that that fraud is glorious, which cauſes thee to breake thy faith given, and agreements made: for that, though it may ſometimes gain thee a ſtate or Kingdom, as formerly hath been ſaid, yet will it never get thee any glory But I ſpeak of ſuch a deceit, which is put in practiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch an enemy that truſts not in thee, and that conſiſts properly in matter of war: as was that of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> when at the lake of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rugia</hi> he feigned a flight, whereby he might have inclos'd the Conſul and the <hi>Roman</hi> Army; and when to eſcape out of <hi>Fabius Maximus</hi> hishand, he tied flaming fire-brands to the horns of his whole heard of cattel.

which was that, which <hi>Pontius</hi> the Samnites General practiſed to ſhut in the Roman Army at the gallows of <hi>Caudium,</hi> where having placed his army behind the mountains, he ſent many of his ſoldiers clad like ſhepherds with much cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel through the plain, and they being taken by the Romans, and required of where the Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites army was, agreed all, according to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der received from <hi>Ponutis,</hi> to ſay that it was gone to the ſiege of Nocera.

                     <p>THe Conſul and the Romane Army, as is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove ſaid, were beſieged by the Samnites, who having propounded to the Romans ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding diſhonorable terms, as was that to make them go under the gallows, and ſend

them without Arms to Rome; and hereupon the Conſuls ſtanding amazed, and the whole army in deſpair, <hi>Lucius Lentulus</hi> the Romanc Lieutenant ſaid, that, as he thought, no condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were to be refuſed to ſave their country: for the ſafety of Rome conſiſting in the life of that Army, he thought it good to ſave it in any caſe: and that the Country is well defended, by what means ſoever it be, either with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, or with glory: for that Army being ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, Rome might in very good time cancel all that ignominy; but in caſe it were not ſaved, however it ſhould dye gloriouſly.

                     <p>WHen the Conſuls were return'd to <hi>Rome</hi> with their diſarm'd army, and the diſgrace which was put upon it, the firſt that ſpake in the Senate, that the peace made at <hi>Candium</hi> ſhould not be obſerv'd, was the Conſul S. <hi>Poſthumius,</hi> ſaying that the people of <hi>Rome</hi> was not tied thereunto, but that he himſelf indeed was bound, and the reſt that had promis'd the peace; and therefore the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple if they would free themſelves from all tyes, were to yeeld up him and the reſt that had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd it with him into the <hi>Samnites.</hi> hands: and this concluſion he held with ſuch obſtinacy, that at length the Senate was content there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, and ſo ſending him and the others to <hi>Sanmiam,</hi> proteſted to the <hi>Samnites,</hi> that the peace was of no force. And in this caſe ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable was fortune to <hi>Peſthumius,</hi> that the <hi>Samnites</hi> held him not; and when he was retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to <hi>Rome</hi> among the <hi>Romans,</hi> he was more glorious by his loſs, then <hi>Pentius</hi> was among the <hi>Samnites</hi> by his conqueſt. Where two things are to be noted. The one is, that in what action ſoever glory may be gotten; for in victory it is ordinarily gain'd, but in loſs, it is obtained either by ſhewing that loſs came not by thy default, or by the atcheivement of ſome valo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous action which may cancell it.

And touching their ſmall faith, every one know mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies were given to King <hi>Charles</hi> the 8. of France, and he promiſed to render the Cittadels of Piſa, and yet he never did it. Wherein that King ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted his ſmall faith, and muth avarice. But let us paſs over theſe matters of late memory. Every one may well have heard of that which followed in the war that the Florentines had with the Vicounts of Milan: when Florence being deprived of all other expedients, thought to bring the Emperor into Italy, by his reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and forces to aſſail Lombardy. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror promiſed to bring a good Army with him, and undertake that war againſt the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, and defend Florence againſt their whole power, in caſe that at his riſing up in arms the Florentines would pay him an hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ducates, and at his arrival in Italy another hundred thouſand; to which agreements the Florentines conſented, and having made the firſt paiment, and afterwards the ſecond, he came onely to Verona, and thence returned back again, having not done any thing in their behalf, blaming them, as if it were their fault, for not having obſerved the conditions between them. So that if Florence had not been either conſtrained by neceſſity, or overcome by paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:30490:262"/>
and had read and known the ancient cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes of the Barbarians, ſhe would never have been neither this time, nor many other times deceived by them, they having behaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves always after one manner, and in every part, and with every one uſed the ſame terms, as it appears they formerly did to the Tuſcans, who being oppreſſed by the Romans, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they had been ſeveral times put in flight by them and routed, and ſeeing that by their own forces alone they were not able to make reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, they agreed with the French, who dwelt on this ſide the Alps in Italy, to give them a ſum of mony, to oblige them to joyn their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies with them, whereby to make head againſt the Romans. Whereupon it followed, that they having taken the monies, would not after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards take arms for them, ſaying theſe they had received, not to make war upon their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, but that they ſhould forbear to forrage the country of Tuſcany. And thus the Tuſcans through the covetouſneſs and ſmall truth of the French, were bereft of their monies and left without the ſuccors they expected from them. Inſomuch as we ſee by this example of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Tuſcans, and that of the Florentines, that the French have continually uſed the ſame terms: and hereby may it eaſily be conjectur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, what truſt Princes can repoſe in them.</p>

Whereupon parting from <hi>Rome</hi> with thoſe forces he could put together, he went thence towards <hi>Bolonia,</hi> and to the <hi>Venetians</hi> he ſent that they ſhould continue Newters, and to the King that he ſhould ſend him forces; ſo that they all being reſtrain'd by the ſmall time they had, and conſidering that the Pope might with reaſon take an open diſtaſt at either their delay or refuſal, gave way to his will, and the King ſent him aid, and the <hi>Venetians</hi> remain'd newters. <hi>De Fois</hi> alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with his Army in <hi>Bolonia,</hi> and having had notice of the rebellion of <hi>Breſſia,</hi> and being deſirous to go to recover it, had two ways, the one through the Kings own domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions long and tedious, the other ſhort through the dominion of <hi>Mantua;</hi> and not only was he neceſſitated to paſs through the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of that Marqueſs, but of force was to paſs by certain ſluces between mariſh grounds and lakes, whereof that country is full, which with fortreſſes &amp; other means were ſhut up, and guarded by him: whereupon <hi>De Fois</hi> having reſolv'd to take the ſhorter paſſage, to overcome all difficulties, &amp; give no time to the Marqueſs to deliberate, at the ſame inſtant brought his ſouldiers on that way, and ſignified to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs

that he ſhould ſend him the keys of the paſſage. So that the Marqueſs ſurpriſed by this ſudden reſolution, ſent him the keys, which he would never have done, if <hi>De Fois</hi> had carried himſelf more cooly in the matter, that Marqueſs being in league with the Pope and the Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and having a ſon of his in the Popes hands, which things gave him many fair colours to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny him. But being aſſailed by the ſudden courſe taken (upon the reaſons already alledged) yeelded.

Such like alſo was that conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the <hi>Baccanalls,</hi> which was diſcovered in the time of the <hi>Macedonian</hi> wars, wherein were intangled many thouſands of men and women: and had it not been revealed, it

But of all the other execution, the moſt terrible was that decimation of armies, where by lot throughout a whole army one of ten was put to death. Nor could there, to chaſtiſe a whole multitude, a more horrible puniſhment be found: for when a multitude offends, where the author is not certain, all cannot ſuffer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are too many: and to puniſh one part, and let the other go ſcotfree, were to wrong thoſe they ſhould puniſh, and thoſe that eſcaped free would be encouraged to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend another time. But to put to death the tenth part by lot, when all deſerve it, he that ſuffers, blames his evill fortune: and he that eſcapes, is afraid leaſt that another time the lot may fall on him, and ſo is wary not to offend. Thoſe empoiſoners then &amp; Baccanalls were pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed as their offences deſerved: And however theſe diſeaſes in a republick produce evill ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:30490:267"/>
yet are they not deadly: for that almoſt alwayes there is time given to correct them; but there is hardly any leaſure in thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the ſtate, which unleſs they fall under the hand of ſome wiſe man, ruine the City.

Having then a mind to offer up my ſelf to your Magnificence, with ſome teſtimony of my ſervice to you, I found nothing in my whole inventory, that I think bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of, or more eſteeme, than the knowlege of great mens actions, which I have learned by a long experience of modern affairs, and a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual reading of thoſe of the ancients. Which, now that I have with great diligence long workt it out, and throughly ſifted, I commend to your Magnificence. And however I may well think this work unworthy of your view; yet ſuch is your humanity, that I doubt not but it ſhall find acceptance, conſidering, that for my part I am not able to tender a greater gift, than to preſent

you with the means, whereby in a very ſhort time you may be able to underſtand all that, which I, in the ſpace of many years, and with many ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances and dangers, have made proof and gaind the knowledge of. And this work I have not ſet forth either with elegancy of diſcourſe or ſtile, nor with any other ornament whereby to captivate the reader, as others uſe, becauſe I would not have it gain its eſteem from elſewhere than from the truth of the matter, and the gravity of the ſubject. Nor can this be thought preſumption, if a man of humble and low condition venture to dilate and diſcourſe upon the governments of Princes; for even as they that with their penſils deſigne out countreys, get themſelves into the plains below to conſider the nature of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and other high places above; and again to conſider the plains below, they get up to the tops of the mountains; in like manner to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the nature of the people, it is fit to be a Prince; and to know well the diſpoſitions of Princes, ſutes beſt with the underſtanding of a ſubject. Your Magnificence then may be pleaſed, to receive this ſmall preſent, with the ſame mind that I ſend it; which if you ſhall throughly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe and conſider, you ſhall perceive therein that I exceedingly wiſh, that you may attain to that greatneſs, which your own fortune, and your excellent endowments promiſe you: and if your Magnificence from the very point of your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhall ſometime caſt your eyes upon theſe inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or places, you ſhall ſee how undeſervedly I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe an extream and continual deſpight of Fortune.</p>

                     <p>I Will not here diſcourſe of Republiques, becauſe I have otherwhere treated of them at large: I will apply my ſelf only to a Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality, and proceed, while I weave this web, by arguing thereupon, how theſe Principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities can be governed and maintained. I ſay then that in States of inheritance, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to the blood of their Princes, there are far fewer difficulties to keep them, than in the new: for it ſuffices only not to tranſgreſs the courſe his Anceſtors took, and ſo afterward to temporiſe with thoſe accidents that can happen; that if ſuch a Prince be but of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary induſtry, he ſhall allwaies be able to maintain himſelf in his State, unleſs by ſome extraordinary or exceſſive power he be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived thereof; and when he had loſt it, upon the leaſt ſiniſter chance that befalls the uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, he recovers it again. We have in <hi>Italy</hi> the Duke of <hi>Ferrara</hi> for example hereof, who was of ability to reſiſt the <hi>Venetians,</hi> in the year 84. and to withſtand Pope <hi>Julius</hi> in the tenth for no other reaſon, than becauſe he had of old continued in that rule; for the natural Prince hath fewer occaſions, and leſs heed to give offence, whereupon of neceſſity he

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:30490:276"/>
for not being able to ſatisfie them according to their expectations, nor put in practice ſtrong remedies againſt them, being obliged to them. For however one be very well provided with ſtrong armies, yet hath he alwaies need of the favor of the inhabitants in the Countrey, to enter thereinto. For theſe reaſons, <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth, King of <hi>France,</hi> ſuddenly took <hi>Milan,</hi> and as ſoon loſt it; and the the firſt time <hi>Lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi> his own forces ſerved well enough to wreſt it out of his hands; for thoſe people that had opened him the gates, finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves deceived of their opinion, and of that future good which they had promiſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, could not endure the diſtaſtes the new Prince gave them. True it is, that Coutreys that have rebelled again the ſecond time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing recovered, are harder loſt; for their Lord, taking occaſion from their rebellion, is leſs reſpective of perſons, but cares only to ſecure himſelf, by puniſhing the delinquents, to clear all ſuſpicions, and to provide for himſelf where he thinks he is weakeſt: ſo that if to make <hi>France</hi> loſe <hi>Milan</hi> the firſt time, it was enough for Duke <hi>Lodwick</hi> to make ſome ſmall ſtir on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the confines; yet afterwards, before they could make him loſe it the ſecond time, they had need of the whole world together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and that all his armies ſhould be waſted and driven out of <hi>Italy;</hi> which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the forenamed cauſes: however though both the firſt and ſecond time it was taken from him. The generall cauſes of the firſt we have treated of; it remains now that we ſee thoſe of the ſecond; and ſet down the remedies that he had, or any one elſe can have that ſhould chance to be in thoſe termes he
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:30490:276"/>
was, whereby he might be able to maintain himſelf better in his conqueſt than the King of France did. I ſay therefore, that theſe States which by Conqueſt are annexed to the ancient ſtates of their conquerors, are either of the ſame province and the ſame language, or otherwiſe; and when they are, it is very eaſy to hold them, eſpecially when they are not uſed to live free; and to enjoy them ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely, it is enough to have extinguiſhed the Princes line who ruled over them: For in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matters, allowing them their ancient conditions, and there being not much difference of manners betwixt them, men ordinarily live quiet enough; as we have ſeen that <hi>Burgundy</hi> did, <hi>Britany, Gaſcouy,</hi> and <hi>Normandy,</hi> which ſo long time continued with <hi>France:</hi> for how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there be ſome difference of language be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, yet can they eaſily comport one with another; and whoſoever makes the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of them, meaning to hold them, muſt have two regards; the firſt, that the race of their former Prince be quite extinguiſhed; the other, that he change nothing, neither in their lawes nor taxes, ſo that in a very ſhort time they become one entire body with their ancient Principality. But when any States are gaind in a Province diſagreeing in language, manners, and orders, here are the difficulties, and here is there need of good fortune, and great induſtry to maintain them; and it would be one of the beſt and livelyeſt remedies, for the Conqueror to goe in perſon and dwell there; this would make the poſſeſſion here of more ſecure and durable; as the Turk hath done in <hi>Greece,</hi> who among all the other cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes taken by him for to hold that State, had he
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:30490:277"/>
not gone thither himſelf in perſon to dwell, it had never been poſſible for him to have kept it: for abiding there, he ſees the diſorders growing in their beginnings, and forthwith can remedy them; whereas being not there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, they are heard of when they are grown to ſome height, and then is there no help for them. Moreover, the Province is not pillaged by the officers thou ſendeſt thither: the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are much ſatisfied of having recourſe to the Prince near at hand, whereupon have they more reaſon to love him, if they mean to be good; and intending to do otherwiſe, to fear him: and forrein Princes will be well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware how they invade that State; inſomuch, that making his abode there, he can very hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loſe it. Another remedy, which is alſo a better, is to ſend Colonies into one or two places, which may be as it were the keys of that State; for it is neceſſary either to do this, or to maintain there many horſe and foot. In theſe colonies the Prince makes no great expence, and either without his charge, or at a very ſmall rate, he may both ſend and maintain them; and gives offence only to them from whom he takes their fields and hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, to beſtow them on thoſe new inhabitants who are but a very ſmall part of that State; and thoſe that he offends, remaining diſperſed and poore, can never hurt him: and all the reſt on one part, have no offence given them, and therefore a ſmall matter keeps them in quiet: on the other ſide, they are wary not to erre, for fear it befalls not them, as it did thoſe that were diſpoild. I conclude then, that thoſe colonies that are not charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, are the more truſty, give the leſs offence;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:30490:277"/>
and they that are offended, being but poor and ſcattered, can do but little harme, as I have ſaid; for it is to be noted, that men muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be dallyed and flattered withall, or elſe be quite cruſht; for they revenge themſelves of ſmall dammages; but of great ones they are not able; ſo that when wrong is done to any man, it ought ſo to be done, that it need fear no return of revenge again, But in lieu of Colonies, by maintaining ſoldiers there, the expence is great; for the whole revenues of that State are to be ſpent in the keepingof it; ſo the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt proves but a loſs to him that hath got it, &amp; endammages him rather; for it hurts that whole State to remove the army from place to place, of which annoyance every one hath a feeling, and ſo becomes enemie to thee; as they are enemies, I wis, who are outraged by thee in their own houſes, whenſoever they are able to do thee miſchief. Every way then is this guard un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable. Beſides, he that is in a different Province, (as it is ſaid) ſhould make himſelf Head and defender of his leſs powerfull neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, and deviſe alwaies to weaken thoſe that are more mighty therein, and take care that upon no chance there enter not any foreiner as mighty as himſelf; for it will alwaies come to paſs, that they ſhall be brought in by thoſe that are diſcontented, either upon ambition, or fear; as the <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>olians</hi> brought the <hi>Romans</hi> into <hi>Greece;</hi> and they were brought into every countrey they came, by the Natives; and the courſe of the matter is, that ſo ſoon as a powerfull Stranger enters a countrey, all thoſe that are the leſs powerfull there, cleave to him, provoked by an envy they beare him that is more mighty than they; ſo that for
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:30490:278"/>
theſe of the weaker ſort, he may eaſily gain them without any pains: for preſently all of them together very willingly make one lump with that he hath gotten: He hath only to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware that theſe increaſe not their ſtrengths, nor their authorities, and ſo he ſhall eaſily be able by his own forces, and their aſſiſtances, to take down thoſe that are mighty, and remain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf abſolute arbitre of that Countrey. And he that playes not well this part, ſhall quickly loſe what he hath gotten; and while he holds it, ſhall find therein a great many troubles and vexations. The <hi>Romans</hi> in the Provinces they ſeiz'd on, obſerved well theſe points, ſent co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies thither, entertained the weaker ſort, without augmenting any thing their power, abated the forces of thoſe that were mighty, and permitted not any powerfull forreiner to gain too much reputation there. And I will content my ſelf only with the countrey of <hi>Greece</hi> for example hereof. The <hi>Achayans</hi> and <hi>Etolians</hi> were entertained by them, the <hi>Macedons</hi> kingdome was brought low, <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> was driven thence, nor ever did the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chayans</hi> or <hi>Etolians</hi> deſerts prevail ſo far for them, that they would ever promiſe to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large their State, nor the perſwaſions of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> induce them ever to be his friends, without bringing him lower; nor yet could <hi>Antiocbus</hi> his power make them ever conſent that he ſhould hold any State in that countrey: for the <hi>Romans</hi> did in theſe caſes that which all judicious Princes ought to do, who are not only to have regard unto all preſent michiefs, but alſo to the future, and to provide for thoſe with all induſtry; for by taking order for thoſe when they are aſarre off, it is eaſie
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:30490:278"/>
to prevent them; but by delaying till they come near hand to thee, the remedy comes too late; for this malignity is grown incurable: and it befalls this, as the phyſicians ſay of the hectick feaver, that in the beginning it is eaſily cur'd, but hardly known; but in the courſe of time, not having been known in the beginning, nor cured, it becomes eaſie to know, but hard to cure. Even ſo falls it out in matters of State; for by knowing it aloof off (which is given only to a wiſe man to do) the miſchiefs that then ſpring up, are quickly helped; but when, for not having been perceived, they are ſuffered to increaſe, ſo that every one ſees them, there is then no cure for them: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Romans,</hi> ſeeing theſe inconvenients a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ar off, alwaies prevented them, and never ſufferd them to follow; for to eſcape a war, becauſe they knew that a war is not underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, but deferred for anothers advantage; therefore would they rather make a war with <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Antiochus</hi> in <hi>Greece,</hi> to the end it ſhould not afterwards be made with them in <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly,</hi> though for that time they were able to avoid both the one and the other, which they thought not good to do: nor did they approve of that ſaying that is ordinarily in the mouthes of the Sages of our dayes, <hi>to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the benefits of the preſent time;</hi> but that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to take the benefit of their valor and wiſdome; for time drives forward every thing, and may bring with it as well good as evil, and evil as good.

King <hi>Lewis</hi> was brought into <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly</hi> by the <hi>Venetians</hi> ambition, who would have gotten for their ſhares half the State of <hi>Lombardy:</hi> I will not blame his comming, or the courſe he took, becauſe he had a mind to begin to ſet a foot in <hi>Italy;</hi> but having not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny friends in the country, all gates being bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red againſt him, by reaſon of King <hi>Charles</hi> his carriage there, he was conſtrained to joyn friendſhip with thoſe he could; and this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration well taken, would have proved lucky to him, when in the reſt of his courſes he had not committed any error.

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:30490:279"/>
their means he might eaſily have been able to ſecure himſelf againſt thoſe that were mightieſt: but he was no ſooner got into <hi>Milan,</hi> than he took a quite wrong courſe, by giving ayd to Pope <hi>Alexander,</hi> to ſeize upon <hi>Romania,</hi> and perceiv'd not that by this reſolution he weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned himſelf, ruining his own friends, and thoſe had caſt themſelves into his boſom, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Church puiſſant, by adding to their Spiritual power, whereby they gaind their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and ſo much temporal eſtate. And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving once got out of the way, he was conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to go on forward; inſomuch as to ſtop <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexanders</hi> ambition, and that he ſhould not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Lord of all <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> of force he was to come into <hi>Italy:</hi> and this ſufficed him not, to have made the Church mighty, and taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his own friends; but for the deſire he had to get the Kingdome of <hi>Naples,</hi> he divided it with the King of <hi>Spain:</hi> and where before he was the ſole arbitre of <hi>Italy,</hi> he brought in a competitor, to the end that all the ambitious perſons of that country, and all that were ill affected to him, might have otherwhere to make their recourſe: and whereas he might have left in that Kingdome ſome Vice King of his own, he took him from thence, to place another there, that might afterward chace him thence. It is a thing indeed very natural and ordinary, to deſire to be of the getting hand: and alwaies when men undertake it, if they can effect it, they ſhall be prais'd for it, or at leaſt not blam'd: but when they are notable, and yet will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake it, here lies the blame, here is the error committed. <hi>If France</hi> then was able with her own power to aſſail the Kingdome of <hi>Naples,</hi> ſhe might well have done it; but not being
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:30490:280"/>
able, ſhe ſhould not have divided it: and if the diviſion ſhe made of <hi>Lombardy</hi> with the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> deſerv'd ſome excuſe, thereby to ſet one foot in <hi>Italy;</hi> yet this merits blame, for not being excus'd by that neceſſity. <hi>Lewis</hi> then committed theſe five faults; extinguiſht the feebler ones, augmented the State of another that was already powerful in <hi>Italy,</hi> brought thereinto a very puiſſant forreiner, came not thither himſelf to dwell there, nor planted any colonies there: which faults while he liv'd, he could not but be the worſe for; yet all could not have gone ſo ill, had he not committed the ſixt, to take from the <hi>Venetians</hi> their State; for if he had not enlarg'd the Churches territories nor brought the <hi>Spaniard</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> it had bin neceſſary to take them lower; but having firſt taken thoſe other courſes, he ſhould never have given way to their deſtruction; for while they had been ſtrong, they would alwaies have kept the others off from venturing on the conqueſt of <hi>Lombardy.</hi> For the <hi>Venetians</hi> would never have given thoir conſents thereto, unleſs they ſhould have been made Lords of it themſelves; and the others would never have taken it from <hi>France,</hi> to give it them: and then they would never have dar'd to go and ſet upon them both together. And if any one ſhould ſay, that King <hi>Lewis</hi> yeelded <hi>Romania</hi> to <hi>Alexander,</hi> and the Kingdome of <hi>Naples</hi> to <hi>Spain,</hi> to avoid a war; <hi>I</hi> anſwer with the reaſons above alledged, that one ſhould never ſuffer any diſorder to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, for avoiding of a war; for that war is not ſav'd, but put off to thy diſadvantage. And if any others argue, that the King had given his word to the Pope, to do that exploit for him, for diſſolving of his marriage, and for giving

the Cardinals Cap to him of <hi>Roan; I</hi> anſwer with that which hereafter I ſhall ſay touching Princes words, how they ought to be kept. King <hi>Lewis</hi> then loſt <hi>Lombardy,</hi> for not having obſerv'd ſome of thoſe termes which others us'd, who have poſſeſſed themſelves of countries, and deſir'd to keep them. Nor is this any ſtrange thing, but very ordinary and reaſonable: and to this purpoſe I ſpake at <hi>Nantes</hi> with that French Cardinal, when <hi>Valentine</hi> (for ſo ordinarily was <hi>Caeſar Borgia</hi> Pope <hi>Alexanders</hi> ſon call'd) made himſelf ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of <hi>Romania;</hi> for when the Cardinal ſaid to me, that the <hi>Italians</hi> underſtood not the feats of war; I anſwered, the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood not matters of State: for had they been well vers'd therein, they would never have ſuffer'd the Church to have grown to that greatneſs. And by experience we have ſeen it, that the power hereof in <hi>Italy,</hi> and that of <hi>Spain</hi> alſo, was cauſed by <hi>France,</hi> and their own ruine proceeded from themſelves.

new gotten, ſome might marvaile how it came to paſs, that <hi>Alexander</hi> the great ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all <hi>Aſia</hi> in a few years; and having hardly poſſeſſed himſelf of it, died; whereupon it ſeemed probable that all that State ſhould have rebelled; nevertheleſs his Succeſſors kept the poſſeſſion of it, nor found they other diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in holding it, than what aroſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves through their own ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I anſwer, that all the Principalities, whereof we have memory left us, have been governed in two ſeveral manners; either by a Prince, and all the reſt Vaſſals, who as mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters by his favor and allowance, do help to govern that Kingdom; or by a Prince and by Barons, who not by their Princes favor, but by the antiquity of blood hold that degree. And theſe kinds of Barons have both ſtates of their own, and Vaſſals who acknowledge them for their Lords; and bare them a true natural affection. Thoſe States that are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd by a Prince and by Vaſſals, have their Prince ruling over them with more authority: for in all his countrey, there is none acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged for ſuperior, but himſelf: and if they yeeld obedience to any one elſe, it is but as to his miniſter and officer, nor beare they him any particular good will. The exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of theſe two different Governments now in our dayes, are, the <hi>Turk,</hi> and the King of <hi>France.</hi> The <hi>Turks</hi> whole Monarchy is govern'd by one Lord, and the reſt are all his Vaſſals; and dividing his whole Kingdom into divers Sangiacques or Governments, he ſends ſeveral thither, and thoſe he chops and changes, as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. But the King of <hi>France</hi> is ſeated in the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:30490:281"/>
midſt of a multitude of Lords, who of old have been acknowledg'd for ſuch by their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and being belov'd by them, enjoy their preheminencies; nor can the King take their States from them without danger. He then that conſiders the one and the other of theſe two States, ſhall find difficulty in the conqueſt of the <hi>Turks</hi> State; but when once it is ſubdu'd, great facility to hold it. The reaſons of theſe difficulties in taking of the <hi>Turks</hi> Kingdom from him, are, becauſe the Invader cannot be called in by the Princes of that Kingdom, nor hope by the rebellion of thoſe which he hath about him, to be able to facilitate his enterprize: which proceeds from the reaſons aforeſaid; for for they being all his ſlaves, and oblig'd to him, can more hardly be corrupted; and put caſe they were corrupted, little profit could he get by it, they not being able to draw after them any people, for the reaſons we have ſhewed: whereupon he that aſſails the <hi>Turk,</hi> muſt think to find him united; and muſt rather relie upon his own forces, than in the others diſorders: but when once he is overcome and broken in the field, ſo that he cannot repair his armies, there is nothing elſe to be doubted than the Royal blood, which being once quite out, there is none elſe left to be feard, none of the others having any credit with the people. And as the conqueror before the victory could not hope in them; ſo after it, ought he not to fear them. The contrary falls out in Kingdoms govern'd as is that of <hi>France:</hi> for it is eaſie to be enter'd by the gaining of any Baron in the Kingdom; for there are alwaies ſome male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents to be found, and thoſe that are glad of innovation. Thoſe for the reaſons alledg'd are
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:30490:282"/>
able to open thee a way into that State, and to further thy victory, which afterwards to make good to thee, draws with it exceeding many difficulties, as well with thoſe that have ayded thee, as thoſe thou haſt ſuppreſt. Nor is it enough for thee to root out the Princes race: for there remaine ſtill thoſe Lords who quickly will be be the ring-leaders of new changes; and in caſe thou art not able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent theſe, nor extinguiſh them, thou loſeſt that State, whenſoever the occaſion is offerd. Now if thou ſhalt conſider what ſort of government that of <hi>Darius</hi> was, thou ſhalt find it like to the <hi>Turks</hi> dominion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Alexander</hi> was neceſſitated firſt to defeat him utterly, and drive him out of the field; after which victory <hi>Darius</hi> being dead, that State was left ſecure to <hi>Alexander,</hi> for the reaſons we treated of before: and his ſucceſſors, had they continued in amity, might have enjoy'd it at eaſe: nor ever aroſe there in that Kingdome other tumults, than thoſe they themſelves ſtir'd up. But of the States that are order'd and grounded as that of <hi>France,</hi> it is impoſſible to become maſter at ſuch eaſe: and from hence grew the frequent rebellions of <hi>Spain, France,</hi> and <hi>Greece</hi> againſt the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> by reaſon of the many Principalities thoſe States had: whereof while the memory laſted, the <hi>Romans</hi> were alwayes doubtfull of the poſſeſſion of them; but the memory of them being quite wip't out, by the power and continuance of the Empire, at length they enjoy'd it ſecurely; and they alſo were able afterwards fighting one with another, each of one them to draw after them the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er part of thoſe provinces, according as their
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:30490:282"/>
authority had gain'd them credit therein: and that becauſe the blood of their ancient Lords was quite ſpent, they acknowledg'd no other but the <hi>Romans.</hi> By the conſideration then of theſe things, no man will marvaile that <hi>Alexander</hi> had ſo little trouble to keep to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the State of <hi>Aſia;</hi> and that others have had ſuch great difficulties to maintain their conqueſt, as <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> and many others; which proceeds not from the ſmall or great valour of the conquerour, but from the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the ſubject.</p>

                        <p>In what manner Cities and Principalities are to be govern'd, which, before they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd, liv'd under their own Laws.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>WHen thoſe States that are conquered, as it is ſaid, have been accuſtomed to live under their own Laws, and in liberty, there are three wayes for a man to hold them. The firſt is to demoliſh all their ſtrong places; the other, perſonally to goe and dwell there; the third, to ſuffer them to live under their own Laws, drawing from them ſome tribute, and creating the rein an Oligarchy, that may continue it in thy ſervice: for that State being created by that Prince, knowes it cannot conſiſt without his aid and force, who is like to doe all he can to maintain it; and with more facility is a City kept by meanes of her own Citizens, which hath been us'd before to live free, than by any other way of keeping. We have for example the <hi>Spartans</hi> and the <hi>Romans;</hi> the <hi>Spartans</hi> held <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Thebes,</hi>
                        <pb n="18" facs="tcp:30490:283"/>
creating there an Oligarchy: yet they loſt it. The <hi>Romans</hi> to be ſure of <hi>Capua, Carthage,</hi> and <hi>Numantia,</hi> diſmantell'd them quite, and ſo loſt them not: they would have kept <hi>Greece</hi> as the <hi>Spartans</hi> had held them, leaving them free, and letring them enjoy their own Laws; and it proſpered not with them: ſo that they were forc'd to deface many Cities of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince to hold it. For in truth there is not a ſurer way to keep them under, than by demoliſhments; and whoever becomes maſter of a City us'd to live free, and diſmantells it not, let him look himſelfe to bee ruin'd by it; for it alwayes in time of rebellion takes the name of libetry for refuge, and the ancient orders it had; which neither by length of time, nor for any favours afforded them, are ever forgotten; and for any thing that can be done, or order'd, unleſſe the inhabitants be diſunited and diſperſ'd, that name is never forgotten, nor thoſe cuſtomes: but preſent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But in Republiques there is more life in them, more violent hatred, more earneſt deſire of revenge; nor does the remembrance of the ancient liberty ever leave
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:30490:283"/>
them, or ſuffer them to reſt: ſo that the ſafeſt way, is, either to ruine them, or dwell among them.</p>

                     <p>LEt no man marvaile, if in the diſcourſe I ſhall make of new Principalities, both touching a Prince, and touching a State, I ſhall alledge very famous examples: for ſeeing men almoſt alwayes walk in the pathes beaten by others, and proceed in their actions by imitation; and being that others wayes cannot bee exactly follow'd, nor their vertues, whoſe parterue thou ſet'ſt before thee, attain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>d unto; a wiſe man ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to tread the footſteps of the worthieſt perſons, and imitate thoſe that have been the moſt excellent: to the end that if his vertue arrive not thereto, at leaſt if may yeeld ſome ſavour thereof, and doe as good Archers uſe, who thinking the place they intend to hit, too farre diſtant, and knowing how farr the ſtrength of their bow will carry, they lay their ayme a great deale higher than the mark; not for to hit ſo high with their arrow, but to bee able with the help of ſo high an aime to reach the place they ſhoot at. I ſay, that in Principalities wholly new, where there is a new Prince, there is more and leſſe difficulty in maintaining them, as the vertue of their Conquerour is greater or leſſer. And becauſe this ſucceſſe, to become
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:30490:284"/>
a Prince of a private man, preſuppoſes either vertue, or fortune; mee thinks the one and other of theſe two things in part ſhould mitigate many difficulties; however he that hath leſſe ſtood upon fortune, hath maintain'd himſelfe the better. Moreover it ſome what facilitates the matter in that the Prince is conſtrain'd, becauſe he hath not other dominions, in perſon to come and dwell there. But to come to theſe who by their owu vertues, and not by fortune, attain'd to be Princes; the excellenteſt of theſe are <hi>Moſes, Cyrus, Romulus, Theſeus,</hi> and ſuch like; and though of <hi>Moſes</hi> we are not to reaſon, he onely executing the things that were commanded him by God; yet merits he well to be admir'd, were it only for that grace that made him worthy to converſe with God. But conſidering <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and the others, who either got or founded Kingdomes, we ſhall find them all admirable; and if there particular actions and Lawes be throughly weigh'd, they will not appeare much differing from thoſe of <hi>Moyſes,</hi> which he receiv'd from ſo Sovraigne an inſtructer. And exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their lives and actions, it will not appeare, that they had other help of fortune, than the occaſion, which preſented them with the matter wherein they might introduce what forme they then pleas'd; and without that occaſion, the vertue of their mind had been extinguiſh'd; and without that vertue, the occaſion had been offer'd in vaine. It was then neceſſary for <hi>Moſes</hi> to find the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſlaves in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and oppreſs'd by the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> to the end that they to get out of their thraldome, ſhould bee wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:30490:284"/>
to follow him. It was fit that <hi>Romulus</hi> ſhould not be kept in <hi>Albia,</hi> but expos'd pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after his birth, that he might become King of <hi>Rome,</hi> and founder of that City. There was need that <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſhould find the <hi>Perſians</hi> diſcontented with the <hi>Medes</hi> government, and the <hi>Medes</hi> delicate and effeminate through their long peace. <hi>Theſeus</hi> could not make proof of his vertue, had not he found the <hi>Athenians</hi> diſpers'd. Theſe occaſions therefore made theſe men happy, and their excellent vertue made the occaſion be taken notice of, whereby their countrey became enobled, and exceeding for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate. They, who by vertuous waies, like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theſe, become Princes, attain the Principality with difficulty, but hold it with much eaſe; and the difficulties they find in gaining the Principality, ariſe partly from the new orders and courſes they are forc'd to bring in, to lay the foundation of their State, and work their own ſecurity. And it is to be conſider'd, how there is not any thing harder to take in hand, nor doubtfuller to ſucceed, nor more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to mannage, than to be the chief in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in new orders; for this Chief finds all thoſe his enemies, that thrive upon the old orders; and hath but luke warme defenders of all thoſe that would do well upon the new orders, which luke-warme temper proceeds partly from fear of the oppoſers who have the laws to their advantage; partly from the incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the men who truly believe not a new thing, unleſs there be ſome certain proof given them thereof. Whereupon it ariſes, that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they that are adverſaries, take the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to aſſayle, they do it factiouſly; and theſe others defend but cooly, ſo that their whole
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:30490:285"/>
party altogether runs a hazzard. Therefore it is neceſſary, being we intend throughly to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe this part, to examine if theſe innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors ſtand of themſelves, or if they depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on others; that is, if to bring their work to effect, it be neceſſary they ſhould intreat, or be able to conſtrain; in the firſt caſe they all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſucceed ill, and bring nothing to paſs; but when they depend of themſelves, and are able to force, then ſeldom it is that they haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard. Hence came it that all the prophets that were arm'd, prevail'd; but thoſe that were unarm'd, were too weak: for beſides what we have alledg'd, the nature of the people is changeable, and eaſie to be perſwaded to a matter; but it is hard alſo to ſettle them in that perſwaſion. And therefore it behoves a man to be ſo provided, that when they beleeve no no longer, he may be able to compel them thereto by force. <hi>Moſes, Cyrus, Theſeus,</hi> and <hi>Romulus</hi> would never have been able to cauſe their Laws long to be obey'd, had they been diſarm'd; as in our times it befel Fryer <hi>Jerome Savanarola,</hi> who periſh'd in his new conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, when the multitude began not to beleeve him; neither had he the means to keep them firme, that had beleev'd; not to force beleefe in them that had not beleev'd him. Wherefore ſuch men as theſe, in their proceedings find great difficulty, and all their dangers are in the way, and theſe they muſt ſurmount by their vertue; but having once maſter'd them, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to be honored by all, when they have rooted thoſe out that envi'd their dignities, they remain powerful, ſecure, honorable, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. To theſe choice examples, I will add one of leſs remark; but it ſhall hold ſome proportion

withthem, and this ſhall ſuffice me for all others of this kind, which is <hi>Hiero</hi> the <hi>Sitacuſan.</hi> He of a private man, became Prince of <hi>Siracuſa,</hi> nor knew he any other ayd of fortune than the occaſion: for the <hi>Siracuſans</hi> being oppreſs'd, made choyce of him for their Captain, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he deſerv'd to be made their Prince: and he was of ſuch vertue even in his private for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, that he who writes of him, ſayes, he wanted nothing of reigning, but a Kingdom; this man extinguiſh'd all the old ſoldiery, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daind the new; left the old allyances, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained new; and as he had friendſhip, and ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers that were his own, upon that ground he was able to build any edifice; ſo that he indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red much trouble in gaining, and ſuffered but little in maintaining.</p>

                     <p>THey who by fortune only become Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of private men, with ſmall pains at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to it, but have much a do to maintain themſelves in it; and find no difficulty at all in the way, becauſe they are carried thither with wings: but all the difficulties ariſe there, after they are plac'd in them. And of ſuch ſort are thoſe who have an eſtate given them for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, by the favor of ſome one that grants it them: as it befell many in <hi>Greece,</hi> in the cities of <hi>Jonia,</hi> and <hi>Helleſpont;</hi> where divers Princes were made by <hi>Darius,</hi> as well for his own ſafety as his glory; as alſo them that were made Emperors; who from private men by
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:30490:286"/>
corrupting the ſoldiers, attaind to the Empire. Theſe ſubſiſt meerly upon the will, and fortune of thoſe that have advanced them; which are two voluble and unſteady things; and they neither know how, nor are able to continue in that dignity: they know not how, becauſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be a man of great underſtanding and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, it is not probable that he who hath always liv'd a private life, can know how to command: neither are they able, becauſe they have not any forces that can be friendly or faithful to them. Moreover thoſe States that ſuddenly fall into a mans hands, as all other things in nature that ſpring and grow quickly, cannot well have taken root, nor have made their correſpondencies ſo firm, but that the firſt ſtorm that takes them, ruines them; in caſe theſe, who (as it is ſaid) are thus on a ſudden clambred up to be Princes, are not of that worth and vertue as to know how to prepare themſelves to maintain that which chance hath caſt into their boſoms, and can afterwards lay thoſe foundations, which others have caſt before they were Princes. For the one and the other of theſe wayes about the attaining to be a Prince, by Vertue, or by Fortune, I will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge you two examples which have been in the dayes of our memory. Theſe were <hi>Francis Sforza,</hi> and <hi>Caeſar Borgia; Francis</hi> by juſt means and with a great deal of vertue, of a private man got to be Duke of Millan; and that which with much pains he had gaind, he kept with ſma<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                        </gap>do. On the other ſide <hi>Caeſar Borgia</hi> (commonly termed Duke <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>alentine)</hi> got his ſtate by his Fathers fortune, and with the ſame loſt it; however that for his own part no pains was ſpar'd, nor any thing omitted, which by a
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:30490:286"/>
diſcreet and valorus man ought to have been done, to faſten his roots in thoſe Eſtates, which others armes or fortune had beſtowed on him; for (as it was formerly ſaid) he that lays not the foundations firſt, yet might be able by means of his extraordinary vertues to lay them afterwards, however it be with the great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the architect, and danger of the edifice. If therefore we conſider all the Dukes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſes, we may perceive how great founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he had caſt for his future power, which I judge a matter not ſuperflnous to run over; becauſe I ſhould not well know, what better rules I might give to a new Prince, than the pattern of his actions; and however the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes he toook, availd him not, yet was it not his fault, but it proceeded from an extraordinary and extream malignity of fortune. Pope <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> the ſixt, deſiring to make the Duke his ſon a great man, had a great many difficulties, preſent and future: firſt he ſaw no way there was whereby he might be able to make him Lord of any State, that was not the Churches; and if he turnd to take that from the Church, he knew that the Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> and the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi> would never agree to it; for <hi>Faenza</hi> and <hi>Riminum</hi> were under the <hi>Venetians</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. Moreover, he ſaw that the armes of <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly,</hi> and thoſe whereof in particular he might have been able to make ſome uſe, were in their hands, who ought to fear the Popes great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: and therefore could not any wayes rely upon them: being all in the <hi>Orſins</hi> and <hi>Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi> hands, and thoſe of their faction. It was neceſſary then, that thoſe matters thus ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by them ſhould be diſturbed, and the States of <hi>Italy</hi> diſordered, to be able ſafely
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:30490:287"/>
to maſter part of them, which he then ſound eaſie to do, ſeeing the <hi>Venetians</hi> upon three conſiderations had us'd the means to bring the <hi>French</hi> men back again into <hi>Italy:</hi> which he not only did not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, but furthered, with a reſolution of King <hi>Lewis</hi> his ancient marriage. The King then paſt into <hi>Italy</hi> with the <hi>Venetians</hi> ayd, and <hi>Alexanders</hi> conſent; nor was he ſooner arrived in <hi>Milan,</hi> than the Pope had ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers from him for the ſervice of <hi>Romania,</hi> which was quickly yeelded up to him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the reputation of the Kings forces. The Duke then having made himſelf maſter of <hi>Romania,</hi> and beaten the <hi>Colonies,</hi> deſiring to hold it, and proceed for ward, two things hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him: the one, his own ſoldiers, which he thought were not true to him; the other, the <hi>French</hi> mens good wills; that is to ſay, he fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the Princes ſoldiers, whereof he had ſerved himſelf, would fail him, and not only hinder his conqueſt, but take from him what he had gotten; and that the King alſo would ſerve him the ſame turn. He had expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of the <hi>Orſini</hi> upon an occaſion, when af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the taking of <hi>Faenza</hi> he aſſaulted <hi>Bolonia,</hi> to which aſſault he ſaw them go very cold. And touching the King, he diſcovered his mind, when having taken the Dutchy of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbin,</hi> he invaded <hi>Tuſcany;</hi> from which action the King made him retire; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Duke reſolved to depend no more upon fortune, and other mens armes. And the firſt thing he did, was, to weaken the <hi>Orſini,</hi> and <hi>Colonnies</hi> factions in <hi>Rome:</hi> for he gain'd all their adherents that were gentlemen, giving them large allowances,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:30490:287"/>
and honoring them according to their quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with charges and governments: ſo that in a few months the good will they bare to the parties was quite extinguiſht, and wholly bent to the Duke. After this, he waited an occaſion to root out the <hi>Orſini,</hi> having before diſpers'd thoſe of the family of <hi>Colonnia,</hi> which fell out well to his hand; and he us'd it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For the <hi>Orſini</hi> being too late aware, that the Dukes and the Churches greatneſs was their deſtruction, held a Council together in a dwelling houſe of theirs in the country ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning to <hi>Peruſia.</hi> From thence grew the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbin,</hi> and the troubles of <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> and many other dangers befell the Duke, which he overcame all with the help of the <hi>French:</hi> and having regained his reputation, truſting neither <hi>France,</hi> nor any forrein for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to the end he might not be put to make trial of them again, he betook himſelf to his ſleghts; and he knew ſo well to diſguiſe his intention, that the <hi>Orſins,</hi> by the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Paul Orſine,</hi> were reconciled to him, to whom the Duke was no way wanting in all manner of courteſies whereby to bring them into ſecurity, giving them rich garments, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and horſes, til their own ſimplicities led them all to to <hi>Sinigcllia,</hi> into his hands. Theſe heads being then pluck'd off, and their partiſans made his friends, the Duke had laid very good foundations, to build his own greatneſs on, having in his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er all <hi>Romania</hi> with the Dutchy of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbin,</hi> and gained the hearts of thoſe people, by beginning to give them ſome reliſh of their well being. And becauſe this part is worthy to be taken notice of, and to be
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:30490:288"/>
imitated by others, I will not let it eſcape. The Duke, when he had taken <hi>Romania,</hi> find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it had been under the hands of poor Lords-who had rather pillag'd their ſubjects, than chaſtis'd or amended them, giving them more cauſe of diſcord, than of peace and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo that the whole countrey was fraught with robberies, quarrels, and other ſorts of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolencies; thought the beſt way to reduce them to termes of pacification, and obedience to a Princely power, was, to give them ſome good government: and therefore he ſet over them one <hi>Remiro D' Orco,</hi> a cruel haſty man, to whom he gave an abſolute power. This man in a very ſhort time ſetled peace and union a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them with very great reputation. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Duke thought ſuch exceſſive autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſerv'd not ſo well to his purpoſe, and doubting it would grow odious, he erected a civil Iudicature in the midſt of the countrey, where one excellent Iudge did Preſide, and thither every City ſent their Advocate: and becauſe he knew the rigors paſt had bred ſome hatred againſt him, to purge the minds of thoſe people, and to gain them wholly to himſelf, he purpos'd to ſhew, that if there was any cruelty uſed, it proceeded not from any order of his, but from the harſh diſpoſition of his Officers. Whereupon laying hold on him, at this occaſion, he caus'd his head to be ſtruck off one morning early in the market place at <hi>Ceſena,</hi> where he was left upon a gibbet, with a bloody ſword by his ſide; the cruelty of which ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle for a while ſatisfied and amaz'd thoſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. But to return from whence we have digreſsd: I ſay, that the Duke fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:30490:288"/>
himſelf very ſtrong, and in part out of doubt of the preſent dangers, becauſe he was arm'd after his own manner, and had in ſome good meaſure ſuppreſs'd thoſe forces, which, becauſe of their vicinity, were able to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy him, he wanted nothing elſe to go on with his Conqueſt, but the conſideration of of <hi>France:</hi> for he knew, that the King, who now, though late, was advis'd of his error, would never ſuffer him: and hereupon he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſeek after new allyances, and to wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with <hi>France,</hi> when the <hi>French</hi> came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Naples</hi> againſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who then beſieged <hi>Gagetta;</hi> and his deſign was only to be out of their danger, which had been effected for him, had Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> lived. And thus were his buſineſſes carried touching his preſent eſtate. As for the future, he had reaſon to doubt leſt the new ſucceſſor to the Papacy would not be his friend, and would endeavor to take that from him that <hi>Alexander</hi> had beſtowed on him; and he thought to provide for this foure waies: Firſt by rooting out the races of all thoſe Lords he had diſpoyled, whereby to take thoſe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions from the Pope. Secondly, by gaining <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> the gentlemen of <hi>Rome,</hi> whereby he might <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> able with thoſe to keep the Pope in ſome awe. Thirdly, to make the Colledge of Cardinals as much at his devotion as poſſibly might be. Fourthly, by making of ſo large Conqueſts, before the Popes death, as that he might be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of himſelf to withſtand the firſt fury of his enemies. Three of theſe fowre at Pope-<hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders</hi> death he had effected, and the fourth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> had neare brought to a point. For of thoſe Lords he had ſtript, he put to death as many as
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:30490:289"/>
he could come at, and very few eſcap'd him: he gaind him the <hi>Roman</hi> Gentlemen: and in the Colledge he had made a great faction. And touching his new Conqueſt, he had a deſigne to become Lord of <hi>Tuscany.</hi> And he had poſſeſſed himſelf already of <hi>Peruſia,</hi> and <hi>Pombin,</hi> and taken protection of <hi>Piſa:</hi> and ſo ſoon as he ſhould have caſt off his reſpect to <hi>France</hi> (which now he meant to hold no longer) being the <hi>French</hi> were now driven out of the Kingdome of <hi>Naples</hi> by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> ſo that each of them was forc'd to buy his friendſhip at any termes; he was then to leap into <hi>Piſa.</hi> After this <hi>Lucca</hi> and <hi>Siena</hi> were preſently to fall to him, partly for envy to the <hi>Florentines,</hi> and partly for fear. The <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi> had no way to eſcape him: all which, had it ſucceeded with him, as without queſtion it had, the very ſame year that <hi>Alexander</hi> dy'd, he had made himſelf maſter of ſo great forces, and ſuch reputation, that he would bave been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to have ſtood upon his own bottom, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any dependance of fortune, or reſting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on others helps, but only upon his own ſtrength and valor. But <hi>Alexander</hi> dy'd five years after that he had begun to draw forth his ſword: and left him ſetled only in the State of <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> with all his other deſignes in the ayre, ſick unto death, between two very ſtrong armies of his enemies; and yet was there in this Duke ſuch a ſpirit and courage: and he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood ſo well, how men are to be gaind, and how to be loſt, and ſo firm were the grounds he had laid in a ſhort time, that, had he not had thoſe armies upon his back, or had been in health, he would have carried through his purpoſe in ſpight of all
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:30490:289"/>
oppoſition; and that the foundations he groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon were good, it appeard in that <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> held for him above a moneth, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained ſecure in <hi>Rome,</hi> though even at deaths doore: and however the <hi>Baglioni, Vitelli,</hi> and <hi>Orſini</hi> came into <hi>Rome;</hi> yet found they none would take their parts againſt him. And this he was able to have effected, that if he could not have made him Pope whom he would, he could have hindred him that he would not ſhould be Pope. But had he been in health when <hi>Alexander</hi> dy'd, every thing had gone eaſily with him; and he told me on that day that <hi>Julius</hi> the ſecond was created Pope, that he had fore-thought on all that which could happen, in caſe his father chanc'd to dye, and for every thing provided its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, this onely excepted, that he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw not that he himſelf ſhould at the ſame time be brought unto deaths dore alſo. Having then collected all the Dukes actions, me thinks I could not well blame him, but rather (as I have here done) ſet him as a pattern to be followed by all thoſe who by fortune and others armes have been exalted to an Empire. For he being of great courage, and having lofty deſignes, could not carry himſelf otherwiſe; and the only obſtacle of his purpoſes was the brevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Alexanders</hi> life, and his own ſickneſs. Whoever therefore deemes it neceſſary in his entrance into a new Principality, to ſecure himſelf of his enemies, and gain him friends, to overcome either by force, or by cunning, to make himſelf beloved, or feared of his people, be followed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenced by his ſoldiers, to root out thoſe that
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:30490:290"/>
can, or owe thee any hurt, to change the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient orders with new wayes, to be ſevere, and yet acceptable, magnanimous, and libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall; to extinguiſh the unfaithfull ſoldiery, and create new; to maintain to himſelf the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of Kings and Princes, ſo that they ſhall either with favor benefit thee, or be wary how to offend thee; cannot find more freſh and lively examples than the actions of this man. He deſerves to be found fault withall for the creation of <hi>Julius</hi> the ſecond, wherein an evil choice was made for him: for, as it is ſaid, not being able to make a Pope to his mind, he could have withheld any one from being Pope; and ſhould never have conſented that any one of thoſe Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals ſhould have got the Papacy, whom he had ever done harme to; or who having attaind the Pontificate were likely to be afraid of him: becauſe men ordinarily do hurt either for fear, or hatred. Thoſe whom he had offended, were among others, he who had the title of St. <hi>Peter ad Vincula, Colonna,</hi> Sr. <hi>George,</hi> and <hi>Aſcanius;</hi> all the others that were in poſſibility of the Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, were ſuch as might have feard him rather, except the Cardinal of <hi>Roan,</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> theſe by reaſon of their allyance and obligation with him, the other becauſe of the power they had, having the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>France</hi> on their party; wherefore the Duke above all things ſhould have created a <hi>Spanyard</hi> Pope, and in caſe he could not have done that, he ſhould have agreed that <hi>Roan</hi> ſhould have been, and not St. <hi>Peter ad Vincula.</hi> And whoever beleeves, that with great perſonages new benefits blot on
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:30490:290"/>
the remembrance of old injuries, is much deceiv'd. The Duke therefore in this election, was the cauſe of this own ruine at laſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Till wee come to this ſeaventh Chapter, I find not any thing much blame-worthy, unleſſe it be on ground he layes in the ſecond Chapter; whereupon hee builds moſt of thiis Fabrick,</hi> viz. <hi>That Subjects muſt either be dallyed or flatterd withall, or quite cruſht. Whereby our Author adviſes his Prince to ſupport his authority with two Cardinall Vertues, Diſſimulation and Cruelty. He conſiders not herein that the head is but a member of the body, though the principall; and the end of the parts is the good of the whole. And here he goes againſt himſelfe in the twenty ſixt Chapter of his Rep. l. 1. where hee blames</hi> Philip <hi>of</hi> Macedon <hi>for ſuch courſes, terming them very cruell, and againſt all Chriſtian manner of living; and that every man ſhou'd refuſe to be a King, and deſire rather to live a private life, than to reigne ſo much to the ruine of mankind. The life of</hi> Caeſar Borgia, <hi>which is here given as a paterne to new Princes, we ſhall find to have been nothing elſe but a cunning Carriage of things ſo, that he might thereby firſt deceive and inveigle, and then ſuppreſſe all thoſe that could oppoſe or hinder his ambition. For if you runne ever his life, you ſhall ſee the Father Pope</hi> Alexander <hi>the ſixt and him, both imbarqued for his advancement, wherein they engag'd the Papall authority, and reputation of Religion; for faith and conſcience theſe men never knew, though they exacted it of others: there was never promiſe made, but it was only ſo farre kept as ſervd for advantage; Liberali ey was made uſe of; Clemency and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:30490:291"/>
Cruelty, all alike, as they might ſerve to worke with their purpoſes. All was ſacrific'd to ambition; no friendſhip could tye theſe men, nor any religion: and no marvell: for ambition made them forget both God and man. But ſee the end of all this cunning: though this</hi> Caeſar Borgia <hi>contrived all his buſineſſe ſo warily, that our Author much commends him, and hee had attaind neere the pitch of his hopes, and had provided for each miſadventure could befall him its remedy; Policy ſhewd it ſelefe ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſighted; for hee foreſaw not at the time of his Fathers death, he himſelf ſhould bee brought unto deaths doore alſo. And me thinks this Example might have given occaſion to our Author to confeſſe, that ſurely there is a God that ruleth the earth. And many times God cutts off thoſe cunning and mighty men in the hight of their purpoſes, when they think they have neare ſurmounted all dangers and difficulties. To the intent that the living may know, that the moſt high ruleth in the Kingdome of men, and giveth it to whomſoever he will, and ſetteth up over in the baſeſt of men.</hi> Daniel. 4. 17.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Concerning thoſe who by wicked meanes have attaind to a Principality.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>BUt becauſe a man becomes a Prince of a private man two wayes, which cannot wholly be attributed either to Fortune or Vertue, I think not fit to let them paſſe me: howbeit the one of them may be more largely diſcourſed upon, where the Republicks are treated of. Theſe are, when by ſome wicked
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:30490:291"/>
and unlawfull meanes a man riſes to the Principality; or when a private perſon by the favour of his fellow Citizens becomes Prince of his countrey. And ſpeaking of the firſt manner, it ſhall be made evident by two Examples, the one ancient, the other moderne, without entring otherwiſe into the juſtice or merit of this part; for I take it that theſe are ſufficient for any body that is forc'd to follow them. <hi>Agathocles</hi> the <hi>Sicilian,</hi> not of a private man onely, but from a baſe and abject fortune, got to be King of <hi>Siracuſa.</hi> This man borne but of a Potter, continued alwayes a wicked life throughout all the degrees of this fortune: nevertheleſſe he accompanied his lewdneſſe with ſuch a courage and reſolution, that applying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to military affaires, by the degrees there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he attained to bee Praetour of <hi>Siracuſa,</hi> and being ſetled in that degree, and having determined that he would become Prince, and hold that by violence and without obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to any other, which by conſent had been granted him: and to this purpoſe have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had ſome private intelligence touching his deſigne with <hi>Amilcar</hi> the <hi>Carithaginian,</hi> who was imployd with his army in <hi>Sicily,</hi> one morning gatherd the people together and the Senate of <hi>Syracuſa,</hi> as if he had ſome what to adviſe with them of matters belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Commonwealth, and upon a ſigne given, cauſ'd his ſouldiers to kill his Senatours, and the richeſt of the people; who being ſlaine, he uſurp'd the Principality of that City without any civill ſtrife: and however he was twice broken by the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and at laſt beſieged, was able not onely to defend his
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:30490:292"/>
own City, but leaving part of his own army at the defence thereof, with the other invaded <hi>Affrique,</hi> and in a ſhort time freed <hi>Siracuſa</hi> from the ſiege, and brought the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> into extreme neceſſity, who were conſtraind to accord with him, be contented with the poſſeſſion of <hi>Affrique,</hi> and quitt <hi>Sicily</hi> to <hi>Agathocles.</hi> He then that ſhould conſider the actions and valour of this man, would not ſee any, or very few things to be attributed unto Fortune; ſeeing that as is formerly ſayd, not by any ones favour, but by the degrees of ſervice in warre with many ſufferings and dangers, to which he had riſen, he came to the Principality; and that hee maintaned afterwards with ſo many reſolute and hazardous undertakings. Yet cannot this be term'd vertue or valour to flay his own Citizens, betray his friends, to be without faith, without pitty, without religion, which wayes are of force to gaine dominion, but not glory: for if <hi>Agathocles</hi> his valour bee well weighd, in his enturing upon, and comming off from dangers, and the greatneſſe of his courage, in ſupporting and maſtering of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities, no man can ſee why he ſhould be thought any way inferiour even to the ableſt Captaines. Notwithſtanding his beaſtly cruelty and inhumanity with innumerable wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, allow not that he ſhould be celebrated among the moſt excellent men. That can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not then be attributed to Fortune or Vertue, which without the one or the other was attaind to by him. In our dayes, while <hi>Alexander</hi> the ſixth held the ſea, <hi>Oliverotie</hi> of <hi>Fermo,</hi> who ſome few yeeres before had been left young by his parents, was brought up
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:30490:292"/>
under the care of an uncle of his on the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſide, called <hi>John Foliani,</hi> and in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his youth given, by him to ſerve in the warres under <hi>Paulo Vitelli:</hi> to the end that being well inſtructed in that diſcipline, he might riſe to ſome worthy degree in the warrs. Afterwards when <hi>Paulo</hi> was dead, he ſerved under <hi>Vitellozzo</hi> his brother, and in very ſhort time, being ingenious, of a good perſonage, and brave courage, he became one of the prime men among the troops he ſerved in: but thinking it but ſervile to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon another, he plotted by the ayd of ſome Citizens of <hi>Fermo</hi> (who lik'd rather the thraldome of their City than the liberty of it) and by the favour of the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>itelli,</hi> to make himſelfe maſter of <hi>Fermo;</hi> and writ to <hi>John Foliani,</hi> that having been many yeeres from home, he had a mind to come and ſee him and the City, and in ſome part take notice os his own patrimony; and becauſe he had not imployd himſelfe but to purchaſe honour, to the end his Citizens might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that he had not vainely ſpent his time, he had a deſire to come in good equipage and accompanied with a hundred horſe of his friends and ſervants; and he intreated him that he would be pleaſd ſo to take order, that he might be honourably received by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>Fermo,</hi> which turnd as well to his honor that was his uncle, as his that was the nephew. In this, <hi>John</hi> faild not in any office of courteſie due to his nephew: and caus'd him to be well receivd by them of <hi>Fermo,</hi> and lodged him in his own houſe: where having paſſed ſome dayes, and ſtayd to put in order ſomewhat that was
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:30490:293"/>
neceſſary for his intended villany, he made a very ſolemne feaſt, whether he invited <hi>John Foliani,</hi> and all the prime men of <hi>Fermo:</hi> and when all their chear was ended, and all their other entertainments, as in ſuch feaſts it is cuſtomary, <hi>Oliverotto</hi> of purpoſe mov'd ſome grave diſcourſes; ſpeaking of the greatneſſe of Pope <hi>Alexander,</hi> and <hi>Caeſar</hi> his ſon, and their undertakings; where unto <hi>John</hi> and the others making anſwer, he of a ſudden ſtood up, ſaying, that thoſe were things to be ſpoken of in a more ſecret place, and ſo retir'd into a chamber, whether <hi>John</hi> and all the others Citizens followd him; nor were they ſooner ſet downe there, than from ſome ſecret place therein came forth diverſe ſouldiers, who ſlew <hi>John</hi> and all the others: after which homicide <hi>Oliverotto</hi> got a horſe-backe and ravaged the whole towne, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged the ſupreme Magiſtrate in the palace, ſo that for feare they were all conſtraind to obey him, and to ſettle a government, whereof hee made himſelfe Prince; and they being all dead who, had they been diſcontented with him, could have hurt him; he ſtrengthned himſelfe with new civill and military orders, ſo that in the ſpace of a yeer that he held the Principality, he was not only ſecure in the City of <hi>Fermo,</hi> but became fearefull to all his neighbours; and the conqueſt of him would have prov'd difficult, as that of <hi>Agathocles,</hi> had he not let himſelfe been deceivd by <hi>Caeſar Borgia,</hi> when at <hi>Sinigallia,</hi> as before was ſaid, he took the <hi>Orſini</hi> and <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>itelli:</hi> where he alſo being taken a yeere after he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the parricide, was ſtrangled together with <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>itellozzo</hi> (whome he had had, for
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:30490:293"/>
maſter both of his vertues and vices.) Some man might doubt from whence it ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, that <hi>Agathocles,</hi> and ſuch like, after many treacheries and crueltyes, could poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly live long ſecure in his own contrey, and defend himſelfe from his forrein enemies, and that never any of his own Citizens conſpir'd againſt him, ſeeing that by means of cruelty, many others have never been able even in peaceable times to maintaine their States, much leſſe in the doubtfull times of warre. I beleeve that this proceeds from the well, or ill uſing of thoſe cruelties: they may bee termd well us'd (if it bee lawfull to ſay well of evill) that are put in practice only once of neceſſity for ſecurities ſake, not inſiſting therein afterwards; but there is uſe made of them for the ſubiects profit, as much as may be. But thoſe that are ill us'd, are ſuch as though they bee but few in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, yet they multiply rather in time, than diminiſh. They that take that firſt way, may with the help of God, and mens care, find ſome remedy for their State, as <hi>Agathocles</hi> did: for the others, it is impoſſible they ſhould continue. Whereupon it is to be noted, that in the lay ing hold of a State, the uſurper thereof ought to runne over and execute all his cruelties at once, that he be not forced often to returne to them, and that he may be able, by not renewing of them, to give men ſome ſecurity, and gaine their affections by doing them ſome courteſies. Hee that carries it otherwiſe, either for fearefullneſſe, or upon evill advice, is alwayes conſtraind to hold his ſword drawne in his hand; nor ever can heerely upon his ſubjects, there being no
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:30490:294"/>
poſſibility for them, becauſe of his daily and continuall injuries, to live in any ſafety: for his injuries ſhould bee done altogether, that being ſeldomer t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <argument>
                        <p>Of the Civill Principality.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>BUt comming to the other part, when a principall Citizen, not by villany, or any other inſufferable violence, but by the favour of his fellow-citizens becomes Prince of his native countrey: which we may terme a Civill Principality; nor to attaine here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto is Verue wholly' or Fortune wholly neceſſary, but rather a fortunate cunning: I ſay, this Principality is climb'd up to, either by the peoples help, or the great mens. For, in every City we finde theſe two humours differ; and they ſpring from this, that the people deſire not to be commanded nor oppreſſed by the great ones, and the great ones are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to command and oppreſſe the people: and from theſe two ſeveral appetites, ariſe in the City one of theſe three effects, either a Principality, or Liberty, or Tumultuary licentionſneſſe. The Principality is cauſed
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:30490:294"/>
either by the people, or the great ones, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the one or other of theſe factions have the occaſion offerd; for the great ones ſeeing themſelves not able to reſiſt the people, begin to turne the whole reputation to one among them, and make him Prince, whereby they may under his ſhadow vent their ſpleenes. The people alſo, not being able to ſupport the great mens inſolencies, converting the whole reputation to one man, create him their Prince, to be protected by his authority. He that comes to the Principality by the aſſiſtance of the great ones, ſubſiſts with more difficulty, than he that attaines to it by the peoples favour; for he being made Prince, hath many about him, who account themſelves his equalls, and therefore cannot diſpoſe nor command them at his pleaſure. But he that gaines the Principality by the peoples favor, finds himſelfe alone in his throne, and hath none or very few neare him that are not very ſupple to bend: beſides this, the great ones cannot upon eaſie termes be ſatisfied, or without doing of wrong to others, where as a ſmall matter contents the people: for the end which the people propound to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, is more honeſt than that of the great men, theſe deſiring to oppreſſe, they only not to be oppreſſed. To this may be added alſo, that the Prince which is the peoples enemy, can never well ſecure himſelfe of them, becauſe of their multitude; well may hee bee ſure of the Nobles, they being but a few. The worſt that a Prince can look for of the people become his enemy, is to be abandoned by them: but when the greatones once grow his enemies, he is not only to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:30490:295"/>
feare their abandoning of him, but their making of a party againſt him alſo: for there being in them more forecaſt and craft, they alwayes take time by the forelocks whereby to ſave themſelves, and ſeeke credit with him who they hope ſhall get the maſtery. The Prince likewiſe is neceſſitated alwayes to live with the ſame people, but can doe well enough without the ſame great men; he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to create new ones, and deſtroy them again every day, and to take from them, and give them credit as he pleaſes: and to cleare this part, I ſay, that great men ought to be conſiderd two wayes principally, that is, if they take thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings ſo much to heart, as to engage their fortunes wholly in thine, in caſe they lye not alwayes catching at ſpoyle, they ought to be well honourd and eſteem'd: thoſe that bind themſelves not to thy fortune, are to be conſiderd alſo two wayes; either they doe it for lack of courage, and naturall want of ſpirit, and then ſhouldſt thou ſerve thy ſelfe of them, and of them eſpecially that are men of good advice; for if thy affaires proſper, thou doſt thy ſelfe honour thereby; if croſt, thou needſt not feare them: but when they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige not themſelves to thee of purpoſe, and upon occaſion of ambition, it is a ſigne they think more of themſelves than of thee: and of theſe the Prince ought to beware, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them as his diſcoverd enemyes: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in thy adverſity they will give a hand too to ruine thee. Therefore ought hee that comes to be Prince by the peoples favour, keepe them his friends: which he may eaſily doe, they deſiring only to live free from op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion:
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:30490:295"/>
but he that becomes Prince by the great mens favour, againſt the will of the people, ought above all things to gaine the people to him, which he may eaſily effect, when he takes upon him their protection: And becauſe men when they find good, where they look for evill, are thereby more endered to their benefactour, therefore growes the people ſo pliant in their ſubjection to him, as if by their favours he had attaind his dignity. And the Prince is able to gaine them to his ſide by many wayes, which becauſe they vary according to the ſubject, no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ertaine rule can be given thereupon; wherefore we ſhall let them paſſe I will only conclude, that it is neceſſary for a Prince to have the people his friend; otherwiſe in his adverſities he hath no helpe. <hi>Nabis</hi> Prince of the <hi>Spartans</hi> ſupported the ſiege of all <hi>Greece,</hi> and an exceeding vict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orious army of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and againſt thoſe defended his native countrey and State, and this ſuffic'd him alone, that as the danger came upon him, he ſecur'd himſelf of a fewer; whereas if the people had been his enemy, this had nothing availd him. And let no man think to overthrow this my opinon with that common proverb, that He who relyes upon the people, layes his foundation in the dirt; for that is true where a private Citizen grounds upon them making his account that the people ſhall free him, when either his enemyes or the Magiſtrates oppreſſe him: In this caſe he ſhould find himſelf often deceiv'd, as it befell the <hi>Gracchyes</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> and in <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence George Scali:</hi> but he being a Prince that grounds thereupon, who can command, and is a man of courage, who hath his wits about
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:30490:296"/>
him in his adverſiryes, and wants not other preparations, and holds together the whole multitude animated with his valour and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, ſhall not prove deceiv'd by them, and ſhall find he hath layd good foundations. Theſe Principalityes are wont to be upon the point of falling when they goe about to skip from the ciuil order to the abſolute: for theſe Princes either command of themſelves, or by the Magiſtrate; in this laſt caſe their State is more weak and dangerous, becauſe they ſtand wholly at the will and pleaſure of theſe Citizens, who then areſet over the Magiſtrates, who eſpecially in adverſe times are able with facility to take their State from them either by riſing up againſt them, or by nor obeying them; and then the Prince is not at hand in thoſe dangers to take the abſolute authority upon him: for the Citizens and ſubjects that are accuſtomed to receive the commands from the Magiſtrates, are not like in thoſe fractions to obey his: and in doubtfull times he ſhall alwayes have greateſt penury of whom he may truſt; for ſuch a Prince cannot ground upon that which he ſees in peaceable times, when the Citizens have need of the State; for then every one runs, and every one promiſes, and very one will venture his life for him, when there is no danger neare; but in times of hazzard, when the State hath need of Citizens, there are but few of them then, and ſo much the more is this experience dangerous, in that it can be but once made. Therefore a prudent Prince ought to deviſe a way whereby his Citizens alwayes and in any caſe and quality of time may have need of his government, and they ſhall alwaies after prove faithfull to him.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>In what manner the Forces of all Principalities ought to be meaſured.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IT is requiſite in examining the quality of thoſe Principalities, to have another conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of them, that is, if a Prince have ſuch dominions, that he is able in caſe of neceſſity to ſubſiſt of himſelf, or elſe whether he hath alwaies need of another to defend him. And to clear this point the better, I judge them able to ſtand of themſelves, who are of power either for their multitudes of men, or quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of money, to bring into the field a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat armie, and ioyn battel with whoever comes to aſſail them: and ſo I think thoſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies to ſtand in need of others help, who are not able to appear in the field againſt the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, but are forc'd to retire within their walls and guard them. Touching the firſt caſe, we have treated already, and ſhall adde ſomwhat thereto as occaſion ſhall require. In the ſecond caſe, we cannot ſay other, ſave only to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage ſuch Princes to fortifie and guard their own Capital city, and of the countrey about, not to hold much account; and whoever ſhall have well fortified that town, and touching o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matters of governments ſhall have beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved himſelf towards his ſubjects, as hath been formerly ſaid, and hereafter ſhall be, ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be aſſaild but with great regard; for men willingly undertake not enterpriſes, where they ſee difficulty to work them through; nor can much facility be there found, where one aſſails him, who hath his town ſtrong and wel
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:30490:297"/>
guarded, and is not hated of his people. The cities of <hi>Germany</hi> are very free; they have but very little of the countrey about them belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them; and they obey the Emperor, when they pleaſe, and they ſtand not in fear, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of him nor any other Potentate about them: for they are in ſuch a manner fortified, that every one thinks the ſiege of any of them would prove hard and tedious: for all of them have ditches and rampires, and good ſtore of Artillery, and alwaies have their publick cellars well provided with meat and drink and firing for a yeer: beſides this, whereby to feed the common people, and without any loſs to the publick, they have alwaies in common whereby they are able for a year to imploy them in the labor of thoſe trades that are the ſinews and the life of that city, and of that induſtry whereby the commons ordinarily ſupported themſelves: they hold up alſo the military exerciſes in repute, and hereupon have they many orders to maintain them. A Prince then that is maſter of a good ſtrong city, and cauſeth not himſelf to be hated, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be aſſaulted; and in caſe he were, he that ſhould aſſail him, would be fain to quit him with ſhame: for the affairs of the world are ſo various, that it is almoſt impoſſible that an army can lie incampt before a town for the ſpace of a whole yeer: and if any ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, that the people having their poſſeſſions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, in caſe they ſhould ſee them a fire, would not have patience, and the redious ſiege and their love to themſelves would make them for get their Prince: I anſwer that a Prince pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſant and couragious, will eaſily maſter thoſe difficulties, now giving his ſubjects hope,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:30490:297"/>
that the miſchiief will not be of durance; ſometimes affright them with the cruelty of their enemies, and other whiles cunningly ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing himſelf of thoſe whom he thinks too forward to run to the enemy. Beſides this by ordinary reaſon the enemy ſhould burne and waſte their countrey, upon his arrival, and at thoſe times while mens minds are yet warme, and reſolute in their defence: and therefore ſo much the leſs ought a Prince doubt: for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome few dayes, that their courages grow coole, the dammages are all done, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs received, and there is no help for it, and then have they more occaſion to cleave faſter to their Prince, thinking he is now more bound to them, their houſes having for his defence been fired, and their poſſeſſions waſted; and mens nature is as well to hold themſelves oblig'd for the kindneſſes they do, as for thoſe they receive; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon if all be well weigh'd, a wiſe Prince ſhall not find much difficulty to keep ſure and true to him his Citizens hearts at the beginning and latter end of the ſiege, when he hath no want of proviſion for food and ammunition.</p>

                        <p>Concerning Eccleſiaſtical Principalities.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THere remains now only that we treat of the Eccleſiaſtical Principalities, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout which all the difficulties are before they are gotten: for they are attained to either by vertue, or Fortune; and without the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:30490:298"/>
one or the other they are held: for they are maintaind by orders inverterated in the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, all which are ſo powerfull and of ſuch na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that they maintain their Princes in their dominions in what manner ſoever they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed and live. Theſe only have an Eſtate and defend it not; have ſubjects and govern them not; and yet their States becauſe unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, are not taken from them; nor their ſubjects, though not govern'd, care not, think not, neither are able to aliene themſelves from them. Theſe Principalities then are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happy and ſecure: but they being ſuſtained by ſuperior cauſes, whereunto humane under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding reaches not, I will not meddle with them: for being ſet up and maintained by God, it would be the part of a preſumptuous and raſh man to enter into diſcourſe of them. Yet if any man ſhould ask me whence it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, that the Church in temporal power hath attaind to ſuch greatneſs, ſeeing that till the time of <hi>Alexander</hi> the ſixt, the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Potentates, and not only they who are entituled the potentates, but every Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron and Lord though of the meaneſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, in regard of the temporality, made but ſmall account of it; and now a King of <hi>France</hi> trembles at the power thereof; and it hath been able to drive him out of <hi>Italy,</hi> and ruine the Venetians; and however this be well known, me thinks it is not ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious in ſome part to recall it to memory. Before that <hi>Charles</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> paſt into <hi>Italy,</hi> this countrey was under the rule of the Pope, <hi>Venetians,</hi> the King of <hi>Naples,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> and the <hi>Florentines.</hi> Theſe Potentates took two things princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:30490:298"/>
to their care; the one, that no forreiner ſhould invade <hi>Italy;</hi> the other, that no one of them ſhould inlarge their State. They, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom this care was moſt taken, were the Pope and the <hi>Venetians;</hi> and to reſtrain the <hi>Venetians,</hi> there needed the union of all the reſt, as it was in the defence of <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rara;</hi> and to keep the Pope low, they ſerved themſelves of the Barons of <hi>Rome,</hi> who being divided into two factions, the <hi>Orſini</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonneſi,</hi> there was alwaies occaſion of offence between them, who ſtanding ready with their armes in hand in the view of the Pope, held the Popedome weak and feeble: and however ſometimes there aroſe a couragious Pope, as was <hi>Sextus;</hi> yet either his fortune, or his wiſdome was not able to free him of theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodities, and the brevity of their lives was the cauſe thereof; for in ten years; which time, one with another, Popes ordinarily liv'd, with much ado could they bring low one of the factions. And if, as we may ſay, one had near put out the <hi>Colonneſi,</hi> there aroſe another enemy to the <hi>Orſini,</hi> who made them grow again, ſo that there was never time quite to root them out. This then was the cauſe, why the Popes temporal power was of ſmall eſteem in <hi>Italy;</hi> there aroſe afterwards Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the ſixt, who of all the Popes that ever were, ſhewed what a Pope was able to do with money and forces: and he effected, by means of his inſtrument, Duke <hi>Valentine,</hi> and by the ocaſion of the <hi>French</hi> mens paſſage, all thoſe things which I have formerly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed upon in the Dukes actions: and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever his purpoſe was nothing at all to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large the Church dominions, but to make
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:30490:299"/>
the Duke great; yet what he did, turnd to the Churches advantage, which after his death when the Duke was taken away, was the heir of all his pains. Afterwards ſucceeded Pope <hi>Julius,</hi> and found the Church great, having all <hi>Romania,</hi> and all the Barons of <hi>Rome</hi> being quite rooted out, and by <hi>Alexanders</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions, all their factions worne down; he found alſo the way open for the heaping up of moneys, never practiſed before <hi>Alexanders</hi> time; which things <hi>Julius</hi> not only follow'd, but augmented; and thought to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf maſter of <hi>Bolonia,</hi> and extinguiſh the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians,</hi> and chaſe the <hi>French</hi> men out of <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:</hi> and theſe deſignes of his prov'd all lucky to him, and ſo much the more to his praiſe in that he did all for the good of the Church, and in no private regard: he kept alſo the factions of the <hi>Orſins</hi> and <hi>Colonneſi,</hi> in the ſame State he found them: and though there were among them ſome head where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to cauſe an alteration; yet two things have held them quiet; the one the power of the Church, which ſomewhat affrights them; the other becauſe they have no Cardinals of their factions, who are the primary cauſes of all the troubles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them: nor ſhall theſe parties ever be at reſt, while they have Cardinals; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they nouriſh the factious both in <hi>Rome,</hi> and abroad; and the Barons then are forced to undertake the defence of them: and thus from the Prelates ambitions ariſe the diſcords and tumults among the Barons. And now hath Pope <hi>Leo</hi> his Holineſs found the Popedome exceeding puiſſant, of whom it is hoped, that if they amplified it by armes

                     </argument>
                     <p>HAving treated particularly of the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of thoſe Principalities, which in the beginning I propounded to diſcourſe upon, and conſidered in ſome part the reaſons of their well and ill being, and ſhewd the waies whereby many have ſought to gain, and hold them, it remains now that I ſpeak in general of the offences and defences, that may chance in each of the forenamed. We have formerly ſaid that it is neceſſary for a Prince to have good foundations laid; otherwiſe it muſt needs be that he go to wrack. The Principal foundations that all States have, as well new, as old, or mixt, are good laws, and good armes; and becauſe there cannot be good laws, where there are not good armes; and where there are good armes, there muſt needs be good laws, I will omit to diſcourſe of the laws, and ſpeak of armes. I ſay then that the armes, wherewithall a Prince defends his State, either are his own, or mercenary, or auxiliary, or mixt. Thoſe that are mercenary and auxiliar, are unprofitable, and dangerous, and if any one holds his State founded upon mercenary armes, he ſhall never be quiet, nor ſecure, becauſe they are never well united,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:30490:300"/>
ambitious, and without diſcipline, treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, among their friends ſtout, among their enemies cowardly; they have no fear of God, nor keep any faith with men; and ſo long on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defer they the doing of miſchief, till the enemy comes to aſſul thee; and in time of peace thou art deſpoyled by them, in war by thy enemies: the reaſon hereof is, becauſe they have no other love, nor other cauſe to keep them in the field, but only a ſmall ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, which is not of force to make them willing to hazard their lives for thee: they are willing indeed to be thy ſoldiers, till thou goeſt to fight; but then they fly, or run away; which thing would coſt me but ſmall pains to perſwade; for the ruine of <hi>Italy</hi> hath not had any other cauſe now a dayes, than for that it hath theſe many years rely'd upon mercena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry armes; which a good while ſince perhaps may have done ſome man ſome ſervice, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves they may have been thought valiant: but ſo ſoon as any forrein enemy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, they quickly ſhewed what they were. Whereupon <hi>Charles</hi> the King of <hi>France,</hi> without oppoſition, made himſelf maſter of all <hi>Italy:</hi> and he that ſaid, that the cauſes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of were our faults, ſaid true; but theſe were not thoſe they beleeved, but what I have told; and becauſe they were the Princes faults, they alſo have ſuffered the puniſhment. I will ſuller ſhew the infelicity of theſe armes. The mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary Captains are either very able men, or not: if they be, thou canſt not repoſe any truſt in them: for they will alwaies aſpire unto their own proper advancements, either by ſuppreſſing of thee that art their Lord, or by ſuppreſſing of ſome one elſe quite out of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:30490:300"/>
thy purpoſe: but if the Captain be not valo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons, he ordinarily ruines thee: and in caſe it be anſwered, that whoever ſhall have his armes in his hands, whether mercenary or not, will do ſo: I would reply, that armes are to be imployed either by a Prince, or Common-wealth. The Prince ought to go in perſon, and performe the office of a comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: the Republick is to ſend forth her Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens: and when ſhe ſends forth one that proves not of abilities, ſhe ought to change him then; and when he does prove valorous, to bridle him ſo by the laws, that he exceed not his commiſſion. And by experience we ſee, that Princes and Republiques of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves alone, make very great conqueſts; but that mercenary armes never do other than harme; and more hardly falls a Republick ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with her own armes under the obedience of one of her own Citizens, than one that is armed by forrein armes. <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Sparta</hi> ſubſiſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

He who overcame not, was <hi>John Aouto,</hi> of whoſe faith there could no proof be made, being he vanquiſht not; but every one will acknowledge, that, had he vanquiſht, the <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines</hi> were at his diſcretion. <hi>Sforza</hi> had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies the <hi>Bracceſchi</hi> for his adverſaries, ſo that they were as a guard one upon another. <hi>Francis</hi> converted all his ambition againſt <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardy.

while themſelves made war, which was before their undertakings by land, where the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen with their own Commons in armes behav'd themſelves bravely: but when they began to fight by land, they loſt their valor, and follow'd the cuſtomes of <hi>Italy;</hi> and in the beginning of their enlargement by land, becauſe thee had not much territory, and yet were of great reputation, they had not much cauſe to fear their Captains; but as they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to extend their bounds, which was under their Commander <hi>Carminiola,</hi> they had a taſte of this error: for perceiving he was excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding valorous, having under his conduct bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the Duke of <hi>Milan;</hi> and knowing on the other ſide, how he was cold in the war, they judg'd that they could not make any great conqueſt with him; and becauſe they neither would, nor could caſhier him, that they might not loſe, what they had gotten, they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced for their own ſafeties to put him to death. Since they have had for their General <hi>Bartho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomew</hi> of <hi>Berganio, Robert</hi> St. <hi>Severin,</hi> the Count of <hi>Petilian,</hi> and ſuch like: whereby they were to fear their loſſes, as well as to hope for gain: as it fell out afterwards at <hi>Vayla,</hi> where in one day they loſt that, which with ſo much pains they had gotten in eight hundred years: for from theſe kind of armes grow ſlack and ſlow and weak gains; but ſadden and wonderfull loſſes: And becauſe I am now come with theſe examples into <hi>Italy,</hi> which now theſe many years, have been go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernd by mercenary armes, I will ſearch deeper into them, to the end that their courſe and progreſs being better diſcoverd, they may be the better amended.

that ſo ſoon as in theſe later times the yoak of the <hi>Italian</hi> Empire began to be ſhaken off, and the Pope had gotten reputation in the temporality, <hi>Italy</hi> was divided into ſeveral States: for many of the great cities took armes againſt their Nobility; who under the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors protection had held them in oppreſſion; and the Pope favored theſe, whereby he might get himſelf reputation, in the temporality; of many others, their Citizens became Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſo that hereupon <hi>Italy</hi> being come into the Churches hands as it were, and ſome few Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicks, thoſe Prieſts and Citizens not accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to the uſe of armes, began to take ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to their pay. The firſt that gave reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to theſe ſoldiers was <hi>Alberick</hi> of <hi>Como</hi> in <hi>Romania.</hi> From his diſcipline among others deſcended <hi>Brachio</hi> and <hi>Sforza,</hi> who in their time were the arbitres of <hi>Italy;</hi> after theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed all others, who even till our dayes have commanded the armes of <hi>Italy;</hi> and the ſucceſs of their valor hath been, that it was overrun by <hi>Charles,</hi> pillaged by <hi>Lewis,</hi> forc'd by <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand,</hi> and diſgrac'd by the <hi>Swiſſers.</hi> The or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which they have held, hath been, firſt whereby to give reputation to their own armes to take away the credit of the Infantry. This they did, becauſe they having no State of their own, but living upon their induſtry, their few foot gave them no reputation, and many they were not able to maintain; whereupon they reduc'd themſelves to cavalery, and ſo with a ſupportable number they were entertained and honored: and matters were brought to ſuch termes, that in an army of twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſoldiers you ſhould not find two thouſand foot. They had moreover us'd all induſtry to

free themſelves and their ſoliders of all pains and fear, in their skirmiſhes, not killing, but taking one another priſoners, and without ranſome for their freedom; they repaired not all to their tents by night, nor made palizado or trench thereabout, nor lay in the field in the ſummer: and all theſe things were thus contrived and agreed of among them in their military orders, whereby (as is ſaid) to avoid pains and dangers, inſomuch as they have brought <hi>Italy</hi> into ſlavery and diſgrace.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>THe Auxiliary forces, being the other kind of unprofitable armes, are, when any pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſant one is called in, who with his forces comes to aſſiſt and defend thee; ſuch as in theſe later times did Pope <hi>Julius</hi> uſe, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſeen the evil proof of his mercenary ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers in the enterprize of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> applied himſelf to the Auxiliaries, and agreed with <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of Spain, that with his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he ſhould aid him. Theſe armes may be profitable and advantagious for themſelves; but for him that calls them in, hurtfull; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in loſing, thou art leſt defeated; and conquering, thou becomeſt their priſoner. And however that of theſe examples the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ſtories are full fraught; yet will <hi>I</hi> not part from this of Pope <hi>Julius</hi> the ſecond, which is as yet freſh: whoſe courſe could not have been more inconſiderate, for the deſire he had to get <hi>Ferrara,</hi> putting himſelf wholly into ſtrangers hands: but his good fortune
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:30490:303"/>
cauſed another cauſe to ariſe, that hindred him from receiving the fruit of his evil choice; for his Auxiliaries being broken at <hi>Ravenna,</hi> and the <hi>Swiſſers</hi> thereupon arriving, who put the Conquerors to flight beyond all opinion, even their own and others, he chanced not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main his enemies priſoner, they being put to flight, nor priſoner to his Auxiliaries, having vanquiſhed by other forces than theirs. The <hi>Florentines</hi> being wholly diſarmed, brought ten thouſand <hi>French</hi> to <hi>Piſa</hi> for to take it, by which courſe they ran more hazzard, than in any time of their troubles. The Emperor of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to oppreſs his neighbors, brought into <hi>Greece</hi> ten thouſand <hi>Turks,</hi> who when the war was ended, could not be got out thence, which was the beginning of <hi>Greeces</hi> fervitude under the Infidels. He then that will in no caſe be able to overcome, let him ſerve himſelf of theſe armes; for they are much more dangerous than the mercenaries; for by thoſe thy ruine is more ſuddenly executed; for they are all united, and all bent to the obedience of another. But for the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenaries to hurt thee, when they have vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, there is no more need of time, and greater occaſion, they not being all united in a body, and being found out and paid by thee, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a third that thou mak'ſt their head, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſuddenly gaine ſo great authority, that he can endammage thee. Inſumme, in the mercenaries their ſloth and lazineſſe to fight is more dangerous: in the auxiliaries their valonr. Wherefore a wiſe Prince hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes avoyded theſe kind of armes, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken himſelf to his owne, and deſired rather to loſs with his owne, than conquer
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:30490:303"/>
with anothers, accounting that not a true victorie which was gotten with others armes. I will not doubt to alleadge <hi>Caeſar Bargia,</hi> and his actions. This Duke entred into <hi>Romania</hi> with auxiliarie armes <hi>s</hi> bringing with him all <hi>French</hi> ſouldiers: but afterwards not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting thoſe armes ſecure, bent hinſelfe to mercenaries, judging leſſe danger to be in thoſe, and tooke in pay the <hi>Orſini</hi> and the <hi>Vitelli,</hi> which afterwards in the proof of them, finding wavering, unfaithful, and dangerous, he extinguiſhd, and betook himſelfe to his owne; and it may eaſily be perceiv'd what difference there is between the one and the other of theſe armes, confidering the difference that was between the Dukes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, when he had the <hi>French</hi> men alone, and when he had the <hi>Orſini</hi> and <hi>Vitelli;</hi> but when he remaind with his own, and ſtood of himſelfe, we ſhall find it was much augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: nor ever was it of grate eſteeme, but when every one ſaw, that he wholly poſſeſſed his owne a mes. I thought not to have parted from the <hi>Italian</hi> examples of late memory; but that I muſt not let paſſe that of <hi>Hiero</hi> the <hi>Siracuſan,</hi> being one of thoſe I formerly nam'd. This man (as I ſaid before) being made general of the <hi>Siracuſans</hi> forces, knew preſently that mercenary ſouldiery was nothing for their profit in that they were hirelings, as our <hi>Italians</hi> are; and finding no way either to hold, or caſhier them, made them all bee cut to peeces, and afterwards waged warre with his owne men, and none others. I will alſo call to memory a figure of the old Teſtament ſerving juſt to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. When <hi>David</hi> preſented himſelfe before
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:30490:304"/>
                        <hi>Saul</hi> to goe to fight with <hi>Goliah</hi> the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> Champion, <hi>Saul</hi> to encourage him, clad him with his owne armes, which <hi>David</hi> when he had them upon his back, refus'd, ſaying, he was not able to make any proofe of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf therein, and therefore would goe meet the enemy with his own ſling and ſword. In ſumme, others armes either fall from thy ſhoulders, or cumber or ſtreighten thee. <hi>Charls</hi> the ſeventh, Father of <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh, having by his good fortune and valour ſet <hi>France</hi> at liberty from the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> knew well this neceſſity of being arm'd with his owne armes, and ſettled in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome the ordinances of men at armes, and infantry. Afterwards King <hi>Lewis</hi> his ſonne aboliſht thoſe of the infantry, and began to take the <hi>Swiſſers</hi> to pay; which errour fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd by the others, is (as now indeed it appeares) the cauſe of that Kingdomes dangers. For having given reputation to the <hi>Swiſſers,</hi> they have renderd all their own armes contemptible; for this hath wholly ruind their foot, and oblig'd their men at armes to forrein armes: for being accuſtomed to ſerve with the <hi>Swiſſers,</hi> they think they are not able to overcome without them. From whence it comes that the <hi>French</hi> are not of force againſt the <hi>Swiſſers,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them alſo againſt others they uſe not to adventure. Therefore are the <hi>French</hi> armies mixt, part more naries, and part natives, which armes are farre better than the ſimple mercenaries or ſimple auxiliaries, and much inferiour to the natives; and let the ſaid example ſuffice for that: for the Kingdome of <hi>France</hi> would have been unconquerable, if
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:30490:304"/>
                        <hi>Charles</hi> his order had been augmented and maintaind but men in their ſmall wiſdome begin a thing, which then becauſe it hath ſome favour of good, diſcovers not the poyſon that lurkes thereunder, as I before ſaid of the h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ctick feavers. Wherefore that Prince which perceives not miſchiefes, but as they grow up, is not truely wiſe; and this is given but to few: and if we conſider the firſt ruine of the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire, we ſhall find it was from taking the <hi>Goths</hi> firſt into their pay; for from that beginning the forces of the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire began to grow weak, and all the valour that was taken hence was given to them. I conclude then that without having armes of their owne, no Principality can be ſecure, or rather is wholly oblig'd to fortune, not having valour to ſhelter it in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity. And it was alwayes the opinion and ſaying of wiſe men, that nothing is ſo weak and unſetled, as is the reputation of power not founded upon ones owne proper forces: which are thoſe that are compoſed of thy ſubjects, or Citizens, or ſervants; all the reſt are mercenary or auxiliary; and the manner how to order thoſe well, is eaſie to find out, if thoſe orders above nam'd by me, ſhall be but run over, and if it ſhall be but conſider'd, how <hi>Philip Alexander</hi> the Great his Father, and in what manner many Republicks and Princes have armd and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed themſelves, to which appointments I referre my ſelfe wholly.</p>

                        <p>What belongs to the Prince touching military Diſcipline.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>A Prince then ought to have no other ayme, nor other thought, nor take any thing elſe for his proper art, but warr, and the orders and diſcipline thereof: for that is the ſole arte which belongs to him that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and is of ſo great excellency, that not only thoſe that are borne Princes, it maintains ſo; but many times raiſes men from a private fortune to that dignity. And it is ſeene by the contrary, that when Princes have given themſelves more to their delights, than to the warres, they have loſt their States; and the firſt cauſe that makes thee loſe it, is the neglect of that arte; and the cauſe that makes thee gaine it, is that thou art ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienc'd and approvd in that arte. <hi>Francis Sforza</hi> by being a man at, armes, of a private man became Duke of <hi>Milan;</hi> and his ſons by excuſing themſelves of the troubles and paines belonging to thoſe imployments of Princes, became private-men. For among other miſchiefes thy neglect of armes brings upon thee, it cauſes thee to be contemnd, which is one of thoſe diſgraces, from which a Prince ought to keepe himſelfe, as hereafter ſhall be ſayd: for from one that is diſarmd to one that is armd there is no proportion; and reaſon will not, that he who is in armes, ſhould willingly yeeld obedience to him that is unfurniſhd of them, and that he that is diſarmd ſhould be in ſecurity among his armed vaſſalls; for there being diſdaine in
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:30490:305"/>
the one, and ſuſpicion in the other, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible theſe ſhould ever well co-operate. And therefore a Prince who is quite unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienc'd in matter of warre, beſides the other infelicities belonging to him, as is ſaid, cannot be had in any eſteeme among his ſouldiers, nor yet truſt in them. Wherefore he ought never to neglect the practice of the arte of warre, and in time of peace ſhould he exerciſe it more than in the warre; which he may be able to doe two wayes; the one practically, and in his labours and recreations of his body, the other theorically. And touching the practick part, he ought beſides the keeping of his own ſubjcts well traind up in the diſcipline and exerciſe of armes, give himſelfe much to the chaſe, whereby to accuſtome his body to paines, and partly to underſtand the manner of ſituations, and to know how the mountaines ariſe, which way the vallyes open themſelves, and how the plaines ars diſtended flat abroad, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive well the nature of the rivers, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh ground, and herein to beſtow very much care, which knowledge is profitable in two kinds: firſt he learnes thereby to know his own countrey, and is the better enabled to underſtand the defence thereof, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by meanes of this knowledge and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in, theſe ſituations, eaſily compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend any other ſituation, which a new he hath need to view, for the little hillocks. val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, plaines, rivers, and marriſh places. For example, they in <hi>Tuſcany</hi> are like unto thoſe of other countries: ſo that from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the ſite of one country, it is eaſie to attain to know that of others. And that
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:30490:306"/>
Prince that wants this skill, failes of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall part a Commander ſhould be furniſht with; for this ſhows the way how to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the enemy, to pitch the camp, to lead their armies, to order their battells, and alſo to beſiege a town at thy beſt advantage. <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopomenes</hi> Prince of the <hi>Achayans,</hi> among other praiſes Writers give him, they ſay, that in time of peace, he thought not upon any thing ſo much as the practiſe of warre; and whenſoever he was abroad in the field to diſport himſelfe with his friends, would often ſtand ſtill, and diſcourſe with them, in caſe the enemies were upon the top of that hill, and we here with our army, whether of us two ſhould have the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and how might we ſafely goe to find them, keeping ſtill our orders; and if we would retire our ſelves, what courſe ſhould we take if they retir'd, how ſhould we follow them? &amp; thus on the way, propounded them all ſuch accidents could befall in any army; would heare their opinions, and tell his owne, and confirme it by argument; ſo that by his conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall thought hereupon, when ever he led any army no chance could happen, for which he had not a remedy. But touching the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of the mind, a Prince ought to read Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and in them conſider the actions of the worthieſt men, marke how they have behav'd themſelves in the warrs, examine the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their victories, and their loſſes; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may be able to avoyd theſe, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine thoſe; and above all, doe as formerly ſome excellent man hath done, who hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken upon him to imitate, if any one that hath gone before him hath left his memory glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; the courſe he took, and kept alwaies near
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:30490:306"/>
unto him the remembrances of his actions and worthy deeds: as it is ſaid, that <hi>Alexander</hi> the great imitated <hi>Achilles; Caeſar Alexander,</hi> and <hi>Scipio Cyrus.</hi> And whoever reads the life of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> written by <hi>Xenophon,</hi> may eaſily perceive afterwards in <hi>Scipio's</hi> life how much glory his imitation gaind him, and how much <hi>Scipio</hi> did conforme himſelfe in his chaſtity, affability, humanity, and liberality with thoſe things, that are written by <hi>Xenophon</hi> of <hi>Cyrus.</hi> Such like wayes ought a wiſe Prince to take, nor ever be idle in quiet times, but by his paines then, as it were provide himſelf of ſtore, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he may make ſome uſe in his adverſity, the end that when the times change, he may be able to reſiſt the ſtormes of his hard fortune.</p>

                        <p>Of thoſe things, in reſpect whereof, men, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially Princes, are praiſed, or diſpraiſed.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IT now remaines that we conſider what the conditions of a Prince ought to be, and his termes of government over his ſubjects, and towards his friends. And becauſe I know that many have written hereupon; I doubt, left I venturing alſo to treat thereof, may be brand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with preſumption, eſpecially ſeeing I am like enough to deliver an opinion different from others. But my intent being to write for the advantage of him that underſtands me, I thought it fitter to follow the effectuall truth of the matter, than the imagination thereof; And many Principalities and Republiques, have been in imagination, which neither have been ſeen nor knowne to be indeed: for there is ſuch a diſtance between how men doe live, and how men ought to
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:30490:307"/>
live; that he who leaves that which is done, for that which ought to be done, learnes ſooner his ruine than his preſervation; for that man who will profeſſe honeſty in all his actions, muſt needs goe to ruine among ſo many that are diſhoneſt. Whereupon it is neceſſary for a Prince, deſiring to preſerve himſelfe, to be able to make uſe of that honeſtie, and to lay it aſide againe, as need ſhall require. Paſſing by then things that are only in ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination belonging to a Prince, to diſcourſe upon thoſe that are really true; I lay that all men, whenſover mention is made of them, and eſpecially Princes, becauſe they are placed aloft in the view of all, are taken notice of for ſome of theſe qualities, which procure them either commendations or blame: and this is that ſome one is held liberal, ſome miſerable, (miſerable I ſay, nor covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; for the covetous deſire to have, though it were by rapine; but a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable man is he, that too much for bears to make uſe of his owne) ſome free givers, others extortioners; ſome cruell, others pitious; the one a Leaguebreaker, another faithfull; the one effeminate and of ſmall courage, the other fierce and couragieus; the one courteous, the other proud; the one laſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, the other chaſte; the one of faire deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the other wily and crafty; the one hard, the other eaſie; the one grave, the other light; the one religious, the other incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and ſuch like. I know that every one will confeſſe, it were exceedingly praiſe worthy for a Prince to be adorned with all theſe above nam'd qualities that are good: but becauſe this is not poſſible, nor doe
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:30490:307"/>
humane conditions admit ſuch perfection in vertues, it is neceſſary for him to be ſo diſcret, that he know how to avoid the infamie of thoſe vices which would thruſt him out of his State; and if it be poſſible, beware of thoſe alſo which are not able to remove him thence; but where it cannot be, let them paſſe with leſſe regard. And yet, let him not ſtand much upon it, though he incurre the infamie of thoſe vices, without which he can very hardly ſave his State: for if all be throughly conſidered, ſome things we ſhall find which will have the colour and very face of Vertue, and following them, they will lead the to thy deſtruction; whereas ſome others that ſhall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <hi>The ſecond blemiſh in this our Authours book, I find in his fifteenth Chapter: where he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs his Prince to uſe ſuch an ambidexterity as that he may ſerve himſelfe either of vertue, or vice, according to his advnatage, which in true pollicy is neither good in attaining the Principality nor in ſecuring it when it is attaind. For Politicks, preſuppoſe Ethiques, which will never allow this rule: as that a man might make this ſmall difference between vertue, and vice, that he may indifferently lay aſide, or take up the, one or the other, and put it in prastiſe as beſt conduceth to the end he propounds himſelfe. I doubt our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour would have blamd</hi> Davids <hi>regard to</hi> Saul, <hi>when</hi> 1 Sam. 24. <hi>in the cave he cut off the lap of</hi> Sauls <hi>garment, and ſpared his head; and afterwards in the 26. when he forbad</hi> Abiſhai <hi>to ſtrike him as he lay ſleeping.

                     <argument>
                        <p>Of Liberality, and Miſerableneſſe.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>BEginning then at the firſt of the above mentioned qualities, I ſay that it would be very well to be accounted liberall: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe, liberality uſed in ſuch a manner, as to make thee be accounted ſo, wrongs thee: for in caſe it be uſed vertuouſly, and as it ought to he, it ſhall never come to be taken notice of, ſo as to free thee from the infamie of its contrary. And therefore for one to hold the name of liberal among men, it were needfull not to omit any ſumptuous quality, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that a Prince alwayes ſo diſpos'd, ſhall waſte all his revenues, and at the end ſhall be forc'd, if he will ſtill maintaine that reputation of liberality, heavily to burthen his ſubjects, and become a great exactour; and put in practiſe all thoſe things that can be done to get mony: which begins to make him hatefull to his ſubjects, and fall into every ones contempt, growing neceſſitous: ſo that having with this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:30490:308"/>
wrong'd many, and imparted of his bounty but to a few; he feels every firſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance, and runs a hazard of every firſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Which he knowing, and deſiring to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw himſelf from, incurs preſently the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace of being termed miſerable. A Prince therefore not being able to uſe this vertue of liberality, without his own damage, in ſuch a ſort, that it may be taken notice of, ought, if he be wiſe, not to regard the name of Miſerable; for in time he ſhall alwaies be eſteemed the more liberal, ſeeing that by his parſimony his own revenues are ſufficient for him; as alſo he can defend himſelf againſt whoever makes war againſt him, and can do ſome exploits without grieving his ſubjects: ſo that he comes to uſe his liberality to all thoſe, from whom he takes nothing, who are infinite in number; and his miſerableneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe to whom he gives nothing, who are but a few. In our dayes we have not ſeen any, but thoſe who have been held miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, do any great matters; but the others all quite ruind. Pope <hi>Julius</hi> the ſecond, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he ſerv'd himſelf of the name of Liberal, to get the Papacy, yet never intended he to continue it, to the end he might be able to make war againſt the King of <hi>France:</hi> and he made ſo many wars without impoſing any extraordinary tax, becauſe his long thrift ſupplyed his large expences. This pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent King of <hi>Spain</hi> could never have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, nor gone through with ſo many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits, had he been accounted liberal. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Prince ought little to regard (that he may not be driven to pillage his ſubiects, that he may be able to defend himſelf, that he
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:30490:309"/>
may not fall into poverty and contempt, that he be not forced to become an extortioner) though he incurre the name of miſerable; for this is one of thoſe vices, which does not pluck him from his throne. And if any one ſhould ſay, <hi>Caeſar</hi> by his liberality obtained the Empire, and many others (becauſe they both were, and were eſteemd liberal) attaind to exceeding great dignities. I anſwer, either thou art already come to be a Prince, or thou art in the way to it; in the firſt caſe, this liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is hurtful; in the ſecond, it is neceſſary to be accounted ſo; and <hi>Caeſar</hi> was one of thoſe that aſpired to the Principality of <hi>Rome.</hi> But if after he had gotten it, he had ſurvived, and not forborne thoſe expences, he would quite have ruined that Empire. And if any one ſhould reply; many have been Princes, and with their armies have done great exploits, who have been held very liberal. I anſwer, either the Prince ſpends of his own and his ſubjects, or that which belongs to others: in the firſt, he ought to be ſparing; in the ſecond, he ſhould not omitany part of liberality. And that Prince that goes abroad with his army, and feeds up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on prey, and ſpoyle, and tributes, and hath the diſpoſing of that which belongs to others, neceſſarily ſhould uſe this liberality; otherwiſe would his ſoldiers never follow him; and of that which is neither thine, nor thy ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, thou mayeſt well be a free giver, as were <hi>Cyrus, Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Alexander;</hi> for the ſpending of that which is anothers, takes not away thy reputation, but rather adds to it, only the waſting of that which is thine own hurts thee; nor is there any thing conſumes it ſelf ſo much as liberality, which whileſt thou
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:30490:309"/>
uſeſt, thou loſeſt the means to make uſe of it, and becomeſt poore and abject; or to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void this poverty, an extortioner and hatefull perſon. And among all thoſe things which a Prince ought to beware of, is, to be diſpiſed, and odious; to one and the other of which, liberality brings thee. Wherefore there is more diſcretion to hold the ſtile of Miſerable, which begets an infamy without hatred, than to deſire that of Liberal, whereby to incurre the neceſſity of being thought an extortioner, which procures an infamy with hatred.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>DEſcending afterwards unto the other fore-alledged qualities, I ſay, that every Prince ſhould deſire to be held pitiful, and not cruel. Nevertheleſs ought he beware that he ill uſes not this pitty. <hi>Caeſar Borgia</hi> was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted cruel, yet had his cruelty redreſt the diſorders in <hi>Romania,</hi> ſetled it in union, and reſtored it to peace, and fidelity: which, if it be well weighed, we ſhall ſee was an act of more pitty, than that of the people of <hi>Florence,</hi> who to avoyd the terme of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, ſuffered <hi>Piſtoya</hi> to fall to deſtruction. Wherefore a Prince ought not to regard the infamy of cruelty, for to hold his ſubjects u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited and fai<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>hfull: for by giving a very few proofes of himſelf the other way, he ſhall be hold more pittiful than they, who through their too much pitty, ſuffer diſorders to
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:30490:310"/>
follow, from whence ariſe murthers and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines: for theſe are wont to hurt an intire u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſality, whereas the executions practiſed by a Prince, hurt only ſome particular. And among all ſorts of Princes, it is impoſſible for a new Prince to avoyd the name of cruel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all new States are full of dangers: Whereupon <hi>Virgil</hi> by the mouth of <hi>Dido</hi> excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the inhumanity of her Kingdom, ſaying,</p>

                     </lg>
                     <p>Nevertheleſs ought he to be judicious in his gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving beleif to any thing, or moving himſelf thereat, nor make his people extreamly afraid of him; but proceed in a moderate way with wiſdome, and humanity, that his too much confidence make him not unwary, and his too much diſtruſt intolerable; from hence ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes a diſpute, whether it is better to be belov'd or feard: I anſwer, a man would wiſh he might be the one and the other: but becauſe hardly can they ſubſiſt both together, it is much ſafer to be feard, than be loved; being that one of the two muſt needs fail; for touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men, we may ſay this in general, they are unthankful, unconſtant, diſſemblers, they avoyd dangers, and are covetous of gain; and whileſt thou doeſt them good, they are whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thine; their blood, their fortunes, lives and children are at thy ſervice, as is ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when the danger is remote; but when it approaches, they revolt. And that Prince who wholly relies upon their words, unfurniſhed
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:30490:310"/>
of all other preparations, goes to wrack: for the friendſhips that are gotten with rewards, and not by the magnificence and worth of the mind, are dearly bought indeed; but they will neither keep long, nor ſerve well in time of need: and men do leſs regard to offend one that is ſupported by love, than by fear. For love is held by a certainty of obligation, which becauſe men are miſchievous, is broken upon any occaſion of their own profit. But fear re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains with a dread of puniſhment which never forſakes a man. Yet ought a Prince cauſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be belov'd in ſuch a manner, that if he gains not love, he may avoid hatred: for it may well ſtand together, that a man may be feard and not hated; which ſhall never fail, if he abſtain from his ſubjects goods, and their wives; and whenſoever he ſhould be forc'd to proceed againſt any of their lives, do it when it is to be done upon a juſt cauſe, and apparent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction; but above all things forbeare to lay his hands on other mens goods; for men for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get ſooner the death of their father, than the loſs of their patrimony. Moreover the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of taking from men their goods, do never fail: and alwaies he that begins to live by ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine, finds occaſion to lay hold upon other mens goods: but againſt mens lives, they are ſeldome found, and ſooner fail. But where a Prince is abroad in the field with his army, and hath a multitude of ſoldiers under his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then is it neceſſary that he ſtands not much upon it, though he be termed cruel: for unleſs he be ſo, he ſhall never have his ſoldiers live in accord one with another, nor ever well diſpoſed to any brave peice of ſervice. Among <hi>Hannibals</hi> actions of mervail, this
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:30490:311"/>
is reckoned for one, that having a very huge army, gathered out of ſeveral nations, and all led to ſerve in a ſtrange countrey, there was never any diſſention neither amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor againſt their General, as well in their bad fortune as their good. Which could not proceed from any thing elſe than from that barbarous cruelty of his, which to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with his exceeding many vertues, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred him to his ſoldiers both venerable and terrible; without which, to that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And that it is true, that his other vertues would not have ſuffic'd him, we may conſider in <hi>Scipio,</hi> the rareſt man not only in the dayes he liv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>d, but even in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of man; from whom his army rebel'd in <hi>Spain:</hi> which grew only upon his too much clemency, which had given way to his ſoldiers to become more licentious, than was well tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable by military diſcipline: for which he was reprov'd by <hi>Fabius Maximus</hi> in the Senate, who termed him the corrupter of the <hi>Roman</hi> ſoldiery. The <hi>Locrenſians</hi> having been deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a Lieutenant of <hi>Scipio's,</hi> were never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd by him, nor the inſolence of that Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant puniſht; all this ariſing from his eaſie na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: ſo that one deſiring to excuſe him in the Senate, ſaid, that there were many men knew better how to keep themſelves from faults, than to correct the faults of other men: which diſpoſition of his in time would have wrong'd <hi>Scipio's</hi> reputation and gloory, had he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with continu'd in his commands: but living
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:30490:311"/>
under the government of the Senate, this quality of his that would have diſgrac'd him not only was conceal'd, but prov'd to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of his glory. I conclude then, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to the purpoſe of being feard, and belov'd; inſomuch as men love at their own pleaſure, and to ſerve their own turne, and their fear depends upon the Princes pleaſure, every wiſe Prince ought to ground upon that which is of himſelf, and not upon that which is of another: only this, he ought to uſe his beſt wits to avoid hatred, as was ſaid.</p>

                        <p>In what manner Princes ought to keep their words.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>HOw commendable in a Prince it is to keep his word, and live with integrity, not making uſe of cunning and ſubtlety, every one knows well: yet we ſee by experience in theſe our dayes, that thoſe Princes have ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected great matters, who have made ſmall reckoning of keeping their words, and have known by their craft to turne and wind men about, and in the end, have overcome thoſe who have grounded upon the truth. You muſt then know, there are two kinds of combating or fighting; the one by right of the laws, the other meerly by force. That firſt way is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to men, the other is alſo common to beaſts: but becauſe the firſt many times ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces not, there is a neceſſity to make recourſe to the ſecond; wherefore it behooves a Prince to know how to make good uſe of that part which belongs to a beaſt, as well as that which is proper to a man. This part hath been co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertly
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:30490:312"/>
ſhew'd to Princes by ancient writers; who ſay that <hi>Achilles</hi> and many others of thoſe ancient Princes were intruſted to <hi>Chiron</hi> the Senator, to be brought up under his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline: the moral of this, having for their tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher one that was half a beaſt and half a man, was nothing elſe, but that it was needful for a Prince to underſtand how to make his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the one and the other nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe neither could ſubſiſt without the other. A Prince then being neceſſitated to know how to make uſe of that part belonging to a beaſt, ought to ſerve himſelf of the conditions of the Fox and the Lion; for the Lion cannot keep himſelf from ſnares, nor the Fox defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf againſt the Wolves. He had need then be a Fox, that he may beware of the ſnares, and a Lion that he may ſcare the wolves. Thoſe that ſtand wholly upon the Lion, underſtand not well themſelves. And therefore a wiſe Prince cannot, nor ought not keep his faith given, when the obſervance thereof turnes to diſadvantage, and the occaſions that made him promiſe, are paſt. For if men were all good, this rule would not be allowable; but being they are full of miſchief, and would not make it good to thee, neither art thou tyed to keep it with them: nor ſhall a Prince ever want lawfull occaſions to give colour to this breach. Very many modern examples hereof might be alledg'd, wherein might be ſhewed how many peaces concluded, and how many promiſes made, have been violated and broken by the infidelity of Princes; and ordinarily things have beſt ſucceeded with him that hath been neareſt the Fox in condition. But it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to underſtand how to ſet a good co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:30490:312"/>
upon this diſpoſition, and to be able to fain and diſſemble throughly; and men are ſo ſimple, and yeeld ſo much to the preſent ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, that he who hath a mind to deceive, ſhall alwaies find another that will be deceivd. I will not conceal any one of the examples that have been of late. <hi>Alexander</hi> the ſixth, never did any thing elſe than deceive men, and never meant otherwiſe, and alwaies found whom to work upon; yet never was there man would proteſt more effectually, nor aver any thing with more ſolemn oaths, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them leſs than he; nevertheleſs, his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenages all thriv'd well with him; for he knew how to play this part cunningly. Therefore is there no neceſſity for a Prince to be endued with all above written qualities, but it behoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth well that he ſeem to be ſo; or rather I will boldly ſay this, that having theſe qualities, and alwaies regulating himſelf by them, they are hurtfull; but ſeeming to have them, they are advantageous; as to ſeem pittiful, faithful, mild, religious, and of integrity, and indeed to be ſo; provided withall thou beeſt of ſuch a compoſition, that if need require to uſe the contrary, thou canſt, and knoweſt how to apply thy ſelf thereto. And it ſuffices to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this, that a Prince, and eſpecially a new Prince, cannot obſerve all thoſe things, for which men are held good; he being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten forc'd, for the maintenance of his State, to do contrary to his faith, charity, humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and religion: and therefore it behooves him to have a mind ſo diſposd, as to turne and take the advantage of all winds and fortunes; and as formerly I ſaid, not forſake the good, while he can; but to know how to make uſe of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        <pb n="78" facs="tcp:30490:313"/>
evil upon neceſſity. A Prince then ought to have a ſpecial care, that he never let fall any words, but what are all ſeaſon'd with the five above written qualities, and let him ſeem to him that ſees and hears him, all pitty, all faith, all integrity, all humanity, all religion; nor is there any thing more neceſſary for him to ſeem to have, than this laſt quality: for all men in general judge thereof, rather by the ſight, than by the touch; for every man may come to the ſight of him, few come to the touch and feeling of him; yvery man may come to ſee what thou ſeemeſt, few come to perceive and underſtand what thou art; and thoſe few dare not oppoſe the opinion of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, who have the majeſty of State to protect them: And in all mens actions, eſpecially thoſe of Princes wherein there is no judgement to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale unto men, forbeare to give their cenſures, till the events and ends of things. Let a Prince therefore take the ſureſt courſes he can to maintain his life and State: the means ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies be thought honorable, and commended by every one; for the vulgar is over-taken with the appearance and event of a thing: &amp; for the moſt part of people, they are but the vulgar: the others that are but few, take place where the vulgar have no ſubſiſteance. A Prince there is in theſe dayes, whom I ſhall not do well to name, that preaches nothing elſe but peace and faith; but had he kept the one and the other, ſeveral times had they taken from him his ſtate and reputation.</p>

                        <hi>In the ſixteenth, ſeventeenth, and eighteenth Chap. our Author deſcends to particulars, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading his Prince in his ſixteenth to ſuch
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:30490:313"/>
a ſuppleneſs of diſpoſition, as that upon occaſion he can make uſe either of liberality or miſerabley neſs, as need ſhall require. But that of liberality is to laſt no longer than while he is in the way to ſome deſigne: which if he well weigh, is not really a reward of vertue, how ere it ſeems; but a bait and lure to bring birds to the net. In the ſeventeenth Chap. he treats of clemency and cruelty, neither of which are to be exercis'd by him as acts of mercy or juſtice; but as they may ſerve to advantage his further purpoſes. And leſt the Prince ſhould incline too much to clemnecy, our Author allows rather the restraint by fear, than by love. The contrary to which all ſtories ſhew us. I will ſay this only, cruelty may cut of the power of ſome, but cauſes the hatred of all, and gives a will to moſt to take the first occaſion offerd for revenge. In the eighteenth Chap. our Author diſcourſes how Princes ought to govern themſelves in keeping their promiſes made: whereof he ſayes they ought to make ſuch ſmall reckoning, as that rather they ſhould know by their craft how to turne and wind men about, whereby to take advantage of all winds and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes. To this I would oppoſe that in the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Pſal. v. 5. He that ſweareth to his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, and diſappointeth him not, though it were to his own hindrance. It was a King that writ it, and me thinks the rule he gave, ſhould well befit both King and Subject: and ſurely this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades againſt all taking of advantages. A man may reduce all the cauſes of faith-breaking to three heads. One may be, becauſe he that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, had no intention to keep his word; and this is a wicked and malitious way of dealing. A ſecond may bee, becauſe hee that promiſd, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents of his promiſe made; and that is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:30490:314"/>
on unconstancy, and lightneſs in that he would not be well reſolved before he entred into covenant. The third may be, when it ſo falls out, that it lyes not in his power that made the promiſe to performe it. In which caſe a man ought to imitate the good debter, who having not wherewithall to pay, hides not himſelf, but preſents his perſon to his credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, willingly ſuffering impriſonment. The first and ſecond are very vitious and unworthy of a Prince: in the third, men might well be directed by the examples of thoſe two famous Romans,</hi> Regulus <hi>and</hi> Poſthumius. <hi>I ſhall cloſe this with the anſwer of</hi> Charles <hi>the fifth, when he was preſſed to break his word with</hi> Luther <hi>for his ſafe return from</hi> Wormes; Fides rerum <note place="margin">

                     <argument>
                        <p>That Princes ſhould take a care, not to incurre contempt or batred.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>BUt becauſe among the qualities, whereof formerly mention is made, I have ſpoken of thoſe of moſt importance, I will treat of the others more briefly under theſe qualityes that a Prince is to beware, as in part is above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, and that he fly thoſe things which cauſe him to be odious or vile: and when ever he ſhall avoid this, he ſhall fully have plaid his part, and in the other diſgrace, he ſhall find no danger at all. There is nothing makes him ſo odious, as I ſaid, as his extortion of his ſubjects goods, and abuſe of their wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:30490:314"/>
from which he ought to forbear: and ſo long as he wrongs not his whole people, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their goods, nor honors, they live con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and he hath only to ſtrive with the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of ſome ſew: which many waies and eaſily too, is reſtrain'd. To be held various, light, effeminate, faint-hearted, unreſolv'd, theſe make him be contemnd and thought baſe, which a Prince ſhould ſhun like rocks, and take a care that in all his actions there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear magnanimity, courage, gravity, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor; and that in all the private affairs of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, he orders it ſo, that his word ſtand irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocable: and maintain himſelf in ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, that no man may think either to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive or wind and turn him about: that Prince that gives ſuch an opinion of himſelf, is much eſteemed, and againſt him who is ſo well eſteemed, hardly are any conſpiracies made by his ſubjects, or by forreiners any invaſion, when once notice is taken of his worth, and how much he is reverenced by his ſubjects: For a Prince ought to have two fears, the one from within, in regard of his ſubjects; the other from abroad, in regard of his mighty neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors; from theſe he defends himſelf by good armes and good friends; and alwayes he ſhall have good friends, if he have good armes; and all things ſhall alwaies ſtand ſure at home, when thoſe abroad are firme, in caſe ſome conſpiracy have not diſturbed them; and however the forrein maſters ſtand but tickliſhly; yet if he have taken ſuch courſes at home, and liv'd as we have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, he ſhall never be able (in caſe he forſake not himſelf) to reſiſt all poſſibility, force and violence, as I ſaid <hi>Nabis</hi> the Spartan
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:30490:315"/>
did: but touching his ſubjects, even when his affairs abroad are ſetled, it is to be fear'd they may conſpire privily; from which a Prince ſufficiently ſecure himſelf by ſhunning to be hated or contemned, and keeping himſelf in his peoples good opinion, which it is neceſſary for him to compaſs, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly we treated at large. And one of the powerfulleſt remedies a Prince can have againſt conſpiracies, is, net to be hated nor diſpiſed by the univerſality; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies he that conſpires, beleeves the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces death is acceptable to the ſubject: but when he thinks it diſpleaſes them, he hath not the heart to venture on ſuch a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for the difficulties that are on the conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators ſide, are infinite. By experience it is plain, that many times plots have been laid, but few of them have ſucceeded luckily; for he that conſpires, cannot be alone, nor can he take the company of any, but of thoſe, who he beleeves are malecontents; and ſo ſoon as thou haſt diſcover'd thy ſelf to a malecontent, thou giveſt him means to work his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: for by revealing thy treaſon, he may well hope for all manner of favour: ſo that ſeeing his gain certain of one ſide; and on the other, finding only doubt and danger, either he had need be a rare friend, or that he be an exceeding obſtinate enemy to the Prince, if he keeps his word with thee. And to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce this matter into ſhort termes: I ſay, there is nothing but jealouſie, fear, and ſuſpect of puniſhment on the conſpirators part to affright him; but on the Princes part, there is the majeſty of the principality, he laws, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences of his friends and the State, which do
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:30490:315"/>
ſo guard him; that to all theſe things the peoples good wills being added, it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible any one ſhould be ſo head-ſtrong as to conſpire; for ordinarily where a traytor is to feare before the execution of his miſchiefe, in this caſe he is alſo to feare afterwards, having the people for his enemy when the fact is commited, and therefore for this cauſe, not being able to hope for any refuge. Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this matter, many examples might be brought; but I will content my ſelfe to name one which fell out in the memory of our Fathers. <hi>Annibal Bentivolii,</hi> grand Father of this <hi>Annibal</hi> who now lives, that was Prince in <hi>Bolonia,</hi> being ſlaine by the <hi>Canne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchi</hi> that conſpir'd againſt him, none of his race being leſt, but this <hi>John,</hi> who was then in ſwadling clouts; preſently the people roſe upon this murder, and ſlew all the <hi>Canneſchi</hi> which proceeded from the popular affection, which the family of the <hi>Bentivolii</hi> held then in <hi>Bolonia:</hi> which was ſo great, that being there remain'd not any, now <hi>Anniball</hi> was dead, that was able to manage the State; and having notice that in <hi>Florence</hi> there was one borne of the <hi>Bentivolii,</hi> who till then was taken for a Smiths ſonne: the citizens of <hi>Bolonia</hi> went to <hi>Florence</hi> for him, and gave the government of their City to him, which was rul'd by him, untill <hi>John</hi> was of fit yeares to governe. I conclude then, that a Prince ought to make ſmall account of treaſons, whiles he hath the people to friend: but if they be his enemies and hate him, he may well feare every thing, and every one. And well ordered States, and diſcreet Princes have taken care withall diligence,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:30490:316"/>
not to cauſe their great men to fall into deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, and to content the people, and ſo to maintaine them: for this is one of the moſt important buſineſſes belonging to a Prince. Among the Kingdomes that are well orderd and governd in our dayes, is that of <hi>France,</hi> and therein are found exceeding many good orders, whereupon the Kings liberty and ſecurity depends: of which the chiefe is the Parliament, and the authority thereof: for he that founded that Kingdome, knowing the great mens ambition and inſolence; and judgeing it neceſſary there ſhould be a bridle to curbe them; and on the other ſide know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the hatred of the Commonalty againſt the great ones, grounded upon feare, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſecure them, would not lay this care wholly upon the King, but take this trouble from him, which he might have with the great men, in caſe he favourd the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty; or with the Commonalty, in caſe he favourd the great men: and thereupon ſet up a third judge, which was that, to the end it ſhould keep under the great ones, and favour the meaner ſort, without any imputation to the King. It was not poſſible to take a better, nor wiſer courſe then this; nor a ſurer way to ſecure the King, and the Kingdome. From whence we may draw another concluſion worthie of note, that Princes ought to cauſe others to take upon them the matters of blame and imputation; and upon themſelves to take only thoſe of grace and favour. Here againe I conclude, that a Prince ought to make good eſteeme of his Nobility, but not thereby to incur the Commons hatred: It would ſeeme perhaps to many, conſidering the life &amp; death
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:30490:316"/>
of many <hi>Romane</hi> Emperours, that they were examples contrary to my opinion, finding that ſome have liv'd worthily, and ſhewd many rare vertues of the minde, and yet have loſt the Empire, and been put to death by their owne ſubjects, conſpiring againſt them. Intending then to anſwer theſe objections, I ſhall diſcourſe upon the qualities of ſome Emperours, declaring the occaſions of their ruine, not diſagreeing from that which I have alledgd; and part thereof I will beſtow on the conſideration of theſe things, which are worthy to be noted by him that reads the actions of thoſe times: and it ſhall ſuffice me to take all thoſe Emperours that ſucceeded in the Empire from <hi>Marcus</hi> the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher to <hi>Maximinus,</hi> who were <hi>Mercus</hi> and <hi>Commodus</hi> his ſonne, <hi>Pertinax, Julian, Severus, Antonius, Caracalla</hi> his ſonne, <hi>Macrinus, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liogabalus, Alexander,</hi> and <hi>Maximin.</hi> And firſt it is to be noted, that where in the other Principalities, they are to contend only with the ambition of the Nobles, and the inſolence of the people; the Romane Emperours had a third difficulty, having to ſupport the cruelty and covetouſneſſe of the ſouldiers, which was ſo hard a thing, that it cauſed the ruine of many, being hard to ſatisfy the ſouldiers, and the people; for the people love their quiet, and therefore affect modeſt Princes; and the ſouldiers love a Prince of a warlike courage, that is inſolent, cruell, and pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from every one: which things they would have them exerciſe upon the people, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they might be able to double their ſtipends, and ſatisfie their avarice and cruelty: whence it proceeds, that thoſe Emperous who either
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:30490:317"/>
by Nature or by Art, had not ſuch a reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as therewith they could curbe the one and the other, were alwayes ruind: and the moſt of them, ſpecially thoſe who as new men came to the principality, finding the difficulty of thoſe two different humours, applyed themſelves to content the ſholdiers, making ſmall account of wronging the people, which was a courſe then neceſſary; for the Princes not being able to eſcape the hatred of every one, ought firſt endeavour that they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſe not the hatred of any whole univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality; and when they cannot attaine there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, they are to provide with all induſtry, to avoyd the hatred of thoſe univerſalities that are the moſt mighty. And therefore thoſe Emperors, who becauſe they were but newly call'd to the Empire, had need of extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary favours, more willingly ſtuck to the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, than to the people; which neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe turned to their advantage, or otherwiſe, according as that Prince knew how to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine his repute with them. From theſe cauſes aforeſayd proceeded it, that <hi>Marcus Pertinax,</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> though all living modeſtly, being lovers of juſtice, and enemies of cruelty, cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and bountifull, had all from <hi>Marcus</hi> on ward, miſerable ends; <hi>Marcus</hi> only liv'd and dy'd exceedingly honoured: for he came to the Empire by inheritance, and was not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it either from the ſoldiers, nor from the people: afterwards being accompanyed with many vertues, which made him venerable, he held alwayes whilſt he liv'd the one and the other order within their limits, and was never either hated, or contemnd. But <hi>Pertinax</hi> was created
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:30490:317"/>
Emperour againſt the ſoldiers wills, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accuſtomed to live licentiouſly under <hi>Commodus,</hi> could not endure that honeſt courſe that <hi>Pertinax</hi> ſought to reduce them to: whereupon having gotten him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hatred, and to this hatred added contempt, in that he was old, was ruind in the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his government. Whence it ought to be obſerved, that hatred is gaind as well by good deeds as bad; and therefore as I formerly ſaid, when a Prince would maintaine the State; he is often forced not to be good: for when that generality, whether it be the people, or ſoldiers, or Nobility, whereof thou thinkſt thou ſtandſt in need to maintain thee, is corrupted, it behoves thee to follow their humour, and content them, and then all good deeds are thy adverſaries. But let us come to <hi>Alexander</hi> who was of that goodneſſe, that among the prayſes given him, had this for one, that in fourteen yeers where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he held the Empire, he never put any man to death, but by courſe of juſtice; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe being held effeminate, and a man that ſuffered himſelfe to be ruled by his mother, and thereupon fallen into contempt, the army conſpird againſt him. Now on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary diſcourſing upon the qualities of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modus, Severus, Antonius, Caracalla,</hi> and <hi>Maximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> you ſhall find them exceeding cruell, and ravinous, who to ſatisfie their ſoldiers, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare no kinde of injury that could be done upon the people; and all of them, except <hi>Severus,</hi> came to evill en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s: for in <hi>Severus,</hi> there was ſuch extraordinary valour, that while he held the ſoldiers his freinds, however the people were much burthend by him, he
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:30490:318"/>
might alwayes reigne happily: for his valour rendred him ſo admirable in the ſoldiers and peoples ſights; that theſe in a manner ſtood amazd and aſtoniſhd, and thoſe others reverencing and honoring him. And becauſe the actions of this man were exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great, being in a new Prince, I will briefly ſhew how well he knew to act the Foxes and the Lions parts; the conditions of which two, <hi>I</hi> ſay, as before, are very neceſſary for a Prince to imitate. <hi>Severus</hi> having had experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of <hi>Iulian</hi> the Emperours ſloth, perſwaded his army (whereof he was commander in <hi>Solavonia)</hi> that they ſhould doe well to goe to <hi>Rome</hi> to revenge <hi>Portinax</hi> his death, who was put to death by the Imperiall guard; and under this pretence, not making any ſhew that he aſpird unto the Empire, ſet his army in march directly towards <hi>Rome,</hi> and was ſooner come into <hi>Italy,</hi> than it was knowne he had mov'd from his ſtation. Being ariv'd at <hi>Rome,</hi> he was by the Senate choſen Emperour for feare, and <hi>Julian</hi> ſlaine. After this beginning, two difficulties yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maind to <hi>Severus,</hi> before he could make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe Lord of the whole State; the one in <hi>Aſia,</hi> where <hi>Niger</hi> the Generall of thoſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies had gotten the title of Emperour, the other in the Weſt with <hi>Albinus,</hi> who alſo aſpird to the Empire: and becauſe he thought there might be ſome danger to diſcover himſelfe enemy to them both, he purpoſed to ſet upon <hi>Niger,</hi> and cozen <hi>Albinas,</hi> to whom he writ, that being elected Emperour by the Senate, he would willingly communicate it with him; and thereupon ſent him the title of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and by reſolution of the Senate, tooke
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:30490:318"/>
him to him for his Colleague; which things were taken by <hi>Albinks</hi> in true meaning. But afterwards when <hi>Severus</hi> had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and ſlaine <hi>Niger,</hi> and pacified the affaires and in the Eaſt, being returned to <hi>Rome,</hi> he complaind in the Senate of <hi>Albinus,</hi> how little weighing the benefits received from him, he had ſought to ſlay him by treaſon, and therefore was he forc'd to goe puniſh his ingratitude: afterwards he went into <hi>France,</hi> where he bereft him both of his State and life, whoever then ſhall in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar examine his actions, ſhall finde he was a very cruell Lion, and as crafty a Fox: and ſhall ſee that he was alwayes feard and reverenc'd by every one, and by the armies not hated; and ſhall nothing mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell that he being a new man, was able to hold together ſuch a great Empire: for his extraordinary reputation defended him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes from that hatred, which the people for his extortions might have conceiv'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. But <hi>Antonius</hi> his ſonne, was alſo an exceeding brave man, and endued with moſt excellent qualities, which cauſd him to be admird by the people, and acceptable to the ſouldiers, becauſe he was a warlike man, enduring all kind of travell and paines, deſpiſing all delicate food, and all kinde of effeminacy, which gaind him the love of all the armies: nevertheleſſe his fierceneſſe and cruelty were ſuch, and ſo hideous, having upon many particular occaſions put to death a great part of the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> and all thoſe of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> that he grew odious to the world, and began to be feard by thoſe alſo that were neare about him; ſo that he was
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:30490:319"/>
ſlaine by a Centurion in the very midſt of his army. Where it is to be noted, that theſe kinde of deaths, which follow upon the deliberation of a reſolv'd and obſtinate minde, cannot by a Prince be avoyded: for every one that feares not to dye, is able to doe it; but a Prince ought to be leſſe afraid of it, becauſe it very ſeldome falls our. Only ſhould he beware not to doe any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamd injury to any of thoſe of whom he ſerves himſelf, or that he hath near about him in any imployment of his Principality, as <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> did: who had reproachfully ſlaine a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of that Centurion; alſo threatned him every day, &amp; nevertheleſſe entertaind him ſtill as one of the guards of his body, which was a raſh courſe taken, and the way to deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as befell him. But let us come to <hi>Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> for whom it was very eaſie to hold the Empire, by reaſon it deſcended upon him by inheritance, being <hi>Marcus</hi> his ſonne, and it had been enough for him to follow his fathers footſteps, and then had he contented both the people and the ſoldiers: but being of a cruell and ſavage deſpoſition, whereby to exerciſe his actions upon the people, he gave himſelfe to entertaine armies, and thoſe in all licentionſneſſe. On the other part not main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining his dignity, but often deſcending upon the ſtages to combate with fencers, and doing ſuch other like baſe things, little worthy of the Imperiall majeſty, he became contemptible in the ſoldiers ſight; and being hated of one part, and deſpiſd of the other, he was conſpird againſt, and ſlaine. It remaines now, that we declare <hi>Maximinus</hi> his conditions, who was a very
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:30490:319"/>
warlike man; and the armies loathing <hi>Alexanders</hi> effeminacy, whereof I ſpake before, when they had ſlain him, choſe this man Emperour, who not long continu'd ſo, becauſe two things there were that brought him into hatred and contempt; the one becauſe he was very baſe, having kept cattell in <hi>Thrace,</hi> which was well knowne to every one, and made them to ſcorne him; the other, becauſe in the beginning of his Principality having delayd to goe to <hi>Rome,</hi> and enter into poſſeſſion of the Imperiall throne, he had gaind the inſamy of being thought exceeding cruell, having by his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in <hi>Rome,</hi> and in every place of the Empire, exerciſd many cruelties, inſomuch that the whole world being provok'd againſt him to contempt for the baſeneſſe of his blood; on the other ſide upon the hatred conceiv'd againſt him for feare of his crulty; firſt <hi>Affrica,</hi> afterwards the <hi>Senate,</hi> with all the people of <hi>Rome</hi> and all <hi>Italy,</hi> conſpired againſt him, with whom his own army took part; which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camping before <hi>Aquileya,</hi> and finding ſome difficulty to take the town, being weary of his cruelties, and becauſe they ſaw he had ſo many enemies, fearing him the leſſe, ſlew him. I purpoſe not to ſay any thing either of <hi>Heliogabalus, Macrinus,</hi> or <hi>Itlian,</hi> who becauſe they were throughly baſe, were ſudenly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh; but I will come to the concluſion of this diſcourſe; and I ſay, that the Princes of our times have leſſe of this difficulty to ſatisfie the Soldiers extraordinarily in their government; for notwithſtanding that there be ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations to be had of them, yet preſently are thoſe armies diſſolv'd, becauſe none of theſe
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:30490:320"/>
Princes do uſe to maintaine any armies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, which are annex'd and inveterated with the governments of the provinces, as were the armies of the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire. And therefore if then it was neceſſary ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to content the ſoldiers than the people, it was becauſe the ſoldiers were more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full than the people: now is it more neceſſary for all Princes, (except the <hi>Turk</hi> and the <hi>Souldan)</hi> to ſatiſfie their people than their ſoldiers, becauſe the people are more mighty than they; wherein I except the <hi>Turk,</hi> he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes maintaining about his perſon 12000 foot, and 15000 horſe, upon which depends the ſafety and ſtrength of his Kingdome; and it is neceſſary that laying afide all other regard of his people, he maintaine theſe his friends. The <hi>Souldans</hi> Kingdome is like hereunto, which being wholy in the ſouldiers power, he muſt alſo without reſpect of his people keep them his friends. And you are to conſider, that this State of the <hi>Souldans</hi> differs much from all the other Principalities: For it is very like the Papacy, which cannot be termd an hereditary Principality: nor a new Principality: for the ſons of the deceaſd Prince are not heires and Lords thereof, but he that is choſen receives that dignity from thoſe who have the authority in them. And this order be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of antiquity, cannot be termd a new Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality, becauſe therein are none of thoſe difficulties that are in the new ones: for though the Prince be new, yet are the orders of that ſtate ancient, and ordaind to receive him, as if he were their hereditary Prince. But let us returne to our matter; whoſoever ſhall conſider our diſcourſe before, ſhall
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:30490:320"/>
perceive that either hatred, or contempt haye caus'd the ruine of the afore-named Emperors; and ſhall know alſo, from it came that part of them proceeding one way, and part a contrary; yet in any of them the one had a happy ſucceſs, and the others un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy: for it was of no availe, but rather hurtful for <hi>Pertinax</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> becauſe they were new Princes, to deſire to imitate <hi>Marcus,</hi> who by inheritance came to the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality: and in like manner it was a wrong to <hi>Caracalla, Commodus,</hi> and <hi>Maximus,</hi> to imitate <hi>Severus,</hi> becauſe none of them were endued with ſo great valor as to follow his ſteps there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Wherefore a new Prince in his Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality cannot well imitate <hi>Marcus</hi> his actions; nor yet is it neceſſary to follow thoſe of <hi>Severus:</hi> but he ought make choyce of thoſe parts in <hi>Severus</hi> which are neceſſary for the founding of a State; and to take from <hi>Marcus</hi> thoſe that are fit and glorious to preſerve a State which is already eſtabliſhed and ſetled.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>SOme Princes, whereby they might ſafely keep their State, have diſarmed their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; ſome others have held the towns under their dominion, divided into factions; others have maintain'd enmities againſt themſelves; others have appli'd themſelves to gain them, where they have ſuſpected at their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the government; others have built
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:30490:321"/>
Fortreſſes; and others again have ruined and demoliſhed them: and however that upon all theſe things, a man cannot well paſs a deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate ſentence, unleſs one comes to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of theſe States, where ſome ſuch like determinations were to be taken; yet I ſhall ſpeak of them in ſo large a manner, as the maſter of it ſelf will bear. It was never then that a new Prince would diſarme his own ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; but rather when he hath found them diſarm'd, he hath alwaies arm'd them. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing belov'd, thoſe armes become thine; thoſe become faithful, which thou hadſt in ſuſpicion; and thoſe which were faithful, are maintaind ſo; and thy ſubjects are made thy parriſans; and becauſe all thy ſubjects cannot be put in armes, when thou beſtoweſt favors on thoſe thou armeſt, with the others thou canſt deal more for thy ſafety; and that difference of proceeding which they know among them, obliges them to thee; thoſe others excuſe thee, judgeing it neceſſary that they have deſervd more, who have undergone more danger, and ſo have greater obligation: but when thou diſarmſt them, thou beginſt to offend them, that thou diſtruſteſt them, either for cowardiſe, or ſmall faith; and the one or the other of thoſe two opinions provokes their hatred agaiſt thee; and becauſe thou canſt not ſtand diſarmed, thou muſt thenturn thy ſelf to mercenary Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery, whereof we have formerly ſpoken what it is, and when it is good; it can never be ſo much as to defend thee from powerful ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and ſuſpected ſubjects; therefore as I have ſaid, a new Prince in a new Principality hath alwaies ordaind them armes. Of exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to this purpoſe, Hiſtories are full. But when
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:30490:321"/>
Prince gains a new State, which as a member he adds to his ancient dominions, then it is neceſſary to diſarme that State, unleſs it be thoſe whom thou haſt diſcoverd to have aſſiſted thee in the conqueſt thereof; and theſe alſo in time and upon occaſions, it is neceſſary to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der delicate and effeminate, and ſo order them, that all the arms of thy State be in the hands of thy own Soldiers, who live in thy ancient State near unto thee. Our anceſtors and they that were accounted Sages, were wont to ſay that it was neceſſary to hold <hi>Piſtoya</hi> in factions, and <hi>Piſa</hi> with Fortreſſes; and for this cauſe main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taind ſome town sſubject to them in differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, whereby to hold it more eaſily. This, at what time <hi>Italy</hi> was ballanc'd in a certain manner, might be well done; but mee thinks it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not now a dayes be well given for a precept; for I do not beleeve, that diviſions made can do any good; rather it muſt needs be, that when the enemy approaches them, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties divided are preſently loſt; for alwaies the weaker part will cleave to the forrein power, and the other not be able to ſubſiſt. The <hi>Venetians</hi> (as I think) mov'd by the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid reaſons, maintaind the factions of the <hi>Guelfes</hi> and <hi>Gibellins,</hi> in their townes; and however they never ſuffer'd them to ſpill one anothers blood, yet they nouriſh'd theſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences among them, to the end that the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens imployd in theſe quarrels, ſhould not plot any thing againſt them: which as it prov'd, never ſerv'd them to any great purpoſe: for being defeated at <hi>Vayla,</hi> preſently one of thoſe two factions took courage and ſeizd upon their whole State. Therefore ſuch like waies argue the Princes weakneſs; for in a ſtrong principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:30490:322"/>
they never will ſuffer ſuch diviſions; for they ſhew them ſome kind of profit in time of peace, being they are able by means thereof more eaſily to mannage their ſubjects: but war comming, ſuch like orders diſcover their fallacy. Without doubt, Princes become great, when they overcome the difficulties and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions that are made againſt them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Fortune eſpecially when ſhe hath to make any new Prince great, who hath more need to gain reputation than an hereditary Prince, cauſes enemies to riſe againſt him, and him to undertake againſt them: to the end he may have occaſion to maſter them, and know that ladder, which his enemies have ſet him upon, whereby to riſe yet higher. And therefore many think, that a wiſe Prince when he hath the occaſion, ought cunningly to nouriſh ſome enmity, that by the ſuppreſſing thereof, his greatneſs may grow thereupon. Princes, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially thoſe that are new, have found more faith and profit in thoſe men, who in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of their State, have been held ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, than in thoſe who at their entrance have been their confidents. <hi>Pandulphus Petrucci,</hi> Prince of <hi>Siena,</hi> governd his State, more with them that had been ſuſpected by him, than with the others. But of this matter we cannot ſpeak at large, becauſe it varies according to the ſubject; I will only ſay this, that thoſe men, who in the beginning of a Principality were once enemies, if they be of quality ſo that to maintain themſelves they have need of ſupport, the Prince might alwaies with the greateſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility gain for his; and they are the rather for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſerve him faithfully, inſomuch as they know it is more neceſſary for them by their
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:30490:322"/>
deeds to cancel that ſiniſter opinion, which was once held of them; and ſo the Prince ever draws from theſe more advantage, than from thoſe, who ſerving him too ſupinely, neglect his affairs. And ſeing the matter requires it, I will not omit to put a Prince in mind, who hath a new made himſelf maſter of a State; by means of the inward helps he had from thence that he conſider well the cauſe that mov'd them that favor'd him to favor him, if it be not a natural affection towards him; for if it be only becauſe they were not content with their former government, with much pains and difficulties ſhall he be able to keep them long his friends, becauſe it will be impoſſible for him to content them. By theſe examples then which are drawn out of ancient and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern affaires, ſearching into the cauſe hereof, we ſhall find it much more eaſie to gain thoſe men for friends, who formerly were conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the State, and therefore were his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: than thoſe, who becauſe they were not contented therewith, became his friends, and favor'd him in getting the maſtery of it. It hath been the cuſtome of Princes, whereby to hold their States more ſecurely, to build Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, which might be bridles and curbs to thoſe that ſhould purpoſe any thing againſt them, and ſo to have a ſecure retreat from the firſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences. I commend this courſe, becauſe it hath been uſed of old; notwithſtanding <hi>Nicholas Vitelli</hi> in our dayes hath been known to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſh two Citadel in the town of <hi>Castello,</hi> the better to keep the State; <hi>Guidubaldo</hi> Duke of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbin</hi> being to return into his State, out of which he was driven by <hi>Caeſar Borgia,</hi> raz'd all the Fortreſſes, of that
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:30490:323"/>
Countrey, and thought he ſhould hardlyer loſe that State again without them. The <hi>Bentivodi</hi> returning into <hi>Bolonia,</hi> uſed the like courſes. Citadels then are profitable, or not, according to the times; and if they advantage thee in one part, they do thee harme in another, and this part may be argued thus. That Prince who ſtands more in fear of his own people than of ſtrangers, ought to build Fortreſſes: but he that is more afraid of ſtrangers than of his people, ſhould let them alone. Againſt the houſe of <hi>Sforza,</hi> the Caſtle of <hi>Milan,</hi> which <hi>Francis Sforza</hi> built, hath and will make more war, than any other diſorder in that State: and therefore the beſt Citadel that may be, is not to incurre the peoples hatred; for however thou holdeſt a Fortreſs, and the people hate thee, thou canſt hardly ſcape them; for people, when once they have taken armes, never want the help of ſtrangers at their need to take ther parts. In our dayes we never ſaw that they ever profited any Prince, unleſs it were the Counteſs of <hi>Furli,</hi> when Count <hi>Hieronymo</hi> of <hi>Furli</hi> her husband was ſlain; for by means thereof ſhe eſcap'd the peoples rage, and attended aid from <hi>Milan,</hi> and ſo recover'd her State: and then ſuch were the times that the ſtranger could not aſſiſt the people: but afterwards they ſerv'd her to little purpoſes when <hi>Caeſar Borgia</hi> aſſaild her, &amp; that the people which was her enemy, ſided with the ſtranger. Therefore both then, and at firſt, it would have been more for her ſafety, not to have been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to the people, than to have held the Fortreſſes. Theſe things being well weigh'd then, <hi>I</hi> will commend thoſe that ſhall build up Fortreſſes, and him alſo that ſhall not; and I
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:30490:323"/>
will blame him, howſoever he be, that relying upon thoſe, ſhall make ſmall account of being hated by his people.</p>

                        </gap>s, and rare tryals of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in Heroick actions. We have now in our dayes <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of <hi>Arragon</hi> the preſent King of <hi>Spain:</hi> he in a manner may be termed a new Prince; for from a very weak King, he is now become for fame and glory, the firſt King of Chriſtendome, and if you ſhall wel conſider his actions, you ſhall find them all il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious, and every one of them extraordinary. He in the beginning of his reign aſſaild <hi>Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> and that exploit was the ground of his State. At firſt he made that war in ſecurity, and without ſuſpicion he ſhould be any waies hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and therein held the Barons of <hi>Caſtiglias</hi> minds buſied, who thinking upon that war, rever minded any innovation; in this while he gaind credit and authority with them, they not being aware of it; was able to maintain with the Church and the peoples money all his ſoldiers, and to lay a foundation for his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary ordinances with that long war, which afterwards gaind him exceeding much honor. Beſides this, to the end he might be able here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>among to undertake greater matters, ſerving himſelf alwaies of the colour of religion, he gave himſelf to a kind of religious cruelty, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and diſpoyling thoſe <hi>Jewes</hi> out of the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:30490:324"/>
Kindome; nor can this example be more admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and rare: under the ſame cloke he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded <hi>Affrick</hi> and went through with his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploit in <hi>Italy:</hi> and laſt of all hath he aſſaild <hi>France,</hi> and ſo alwaies proceeded on forwards contriving of great matters, which alwaies have held his ſubjects minds in peace and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and buſied in attending the event, what it ſhould be: and theſe his actions have thus grown, one upon another, that they have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver given leiſure to men ſo to reſt, as they might ever plot any thing againſt them. Moreover it much avails a Prince to give extraordinary proofes of himſelf touching the government within, ſuch as thoſe we have heard of <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> of <hi>Milan,</hi> whenſoever occaſion is given by any one, that may off ctuate ſome great thing either of good or evil, in the civil go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and to find out ſome way either to reward or puniſh it, whereof in the wolud much notice may be taken. And above all things a Prince ought to endeavor in all his actions to ſpread abroad a fame of his magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and worthineſs. A Prince alſo is well eſteemed, when he is a true friend, or a true enemy; when without any regard he diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers himſelf in favor of one againſt another; which courſe ſhall be alwaies more profit, than to ſtand neuter: for if two mighty ones that are thy neighbors, come to fall out, or are of ſuch quality, that one of them vanquiſhing, thou art like to be in fear of the vanquiſher, or not; in either of theſe two caſes, it will ever prove more for thy profit, to diſcover thy ſelf, and make a good war of it: for in the firſt caſe, if thou diſcovereſt not thy ſelfe, thou ſhalt alwaies be a prey to
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:30490:324"/>
him that overcomes, to the contentment and ſatisfaction of the vanquiſht; neither ſhalt thou have reaſon on thy ſide, nor any thing elſe to defend or receive thee. For he that overcomes, will not have any ſuſpected friends that give him no aſſiſtance in his neceſſity: and he that loſes, receives thee not, becauſe thou would<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt not with thy armes in hand run the haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of his fortune. <hi>Antiochus</hi> paſſed into <hi>Greece,</hi> thereunto induc'd by the <hi>Etolians,</hi> to chace the <hi>Romans</hi> thence: and ſent his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors to the <hi>Achayans,</hi> who were the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> friends, to perſwade them to ſtand neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; on the other ſide the <hi>Romans</hi> moved them to joyne armes with theirs: this matter came to be deliberated on in the council of the <hi>Achayans,</hi> where <hi>Antiochus</hi> his Ambaſſador encouraged them to ſtand neuters, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the <hi>Romans</hi> Ambaſſador anſwerd; Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the courſe, that is commended to you, as beſt and profitableſt for your State, to wit, not to intermeddle in the war between us, nothing can be more againſt you: becauſe, not taking either part, you ſhall remain with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thanks, and without reputation a prey to the conqueror. And it will alwaies come to paſs that he who is not thy friend, will requite thy neutrality; and he that is thy friend, will urge thee to diſcover thy ſelf by taking arms for him: and evil adviſed Princes, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyd the preſent dangers, folow often times that way of neutrality, and moſt commonly go to ruine: but when a Prince diſcovers himſelf ſtrongly in favor of a party, if he to whom thou cleaveſt, overcomes, however that he be puiſſant, and thou remaineſt at his diſpoſing, he is oblig'd to thee,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:30490:325"/>
and there is a contract of friendſhip made; and men are never ſo openly diſhoneſt, as with ſuch a notorious example of diſhoneſty to oppreſs thee. Beſides victories are never ſo proſperous, that the conqueror is like neglect all reſpects, and eſpecially of juſtice. But if he to whom thou ſtickſt, loſes, thou art received by him; and, while he is able, he aydes thee, and ſo thou becomeſt partner of a fortune that may ariſe again; the ſecond caſe, when they that enter into the liſts together, are of ſuch quality, that thou needeſt not fear him that vanquiſheth, ſo much the more is it diſcretion in thee to ſtick to him; for thou go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to ruine one with his aſſiſtance, who ought to do the beſt he could to ſave him, if he were well adviſed; and he overcomming, is left at thy diſcretion, and it is unpoſſible but with thy ayd he muſt overcome. And here it is to be noted, that a Prince ſhould be well aware never to joyn with any one more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull than himſelf, to offend another, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs upon neceſſity, as formerly is ſaid. For when he overcomes, thou art left at his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, and Princes ought avoid as much as they are able, to ſtand at anothers diſcretion. The <hi>Venetians</hi> took part with <hi>France</hi> againſt the Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> and yet could have avoided that partaking, from which proceeded their ruine. But when it cannot be avoyded, as in befel the <hi>Florentines</hi> when the Pope and the King of <hi>Spain</hi> went both with their armies to <hi>Lombardy,</hi> there the Prince ought to ſide with them for the reaſons aforeſaid. Nor let any State think they are able to make ſuch ſure parties, but rather that they are all doubtfull; for in the order of things we
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:30490:325"/>
find it alwaies, that whenſoever a man ſeeks to avoid one inconvenient, he incurs another. But the principal point of judgement, is in diſcerning between the qualities of inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, and not taking the bad for the good. Moreover a Prince ought to ſhew himſelf a lover of vertue, and that he honors thoſe that excel in every Art. Afterwards ought he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage his Citizens, whereby they may be enabled quickly to exerciſe their faculties as well in merchandiſe, and husbandry, as in any other kind of traffick, to the end that no man forbear to adorne and cultivate his poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions for fear that he be deſpoyled of them; or any other to open the commerce upon the danger of heavy impoſitions: but rather to provide rewards for thoſe that ſhall ſet theſe matters afoot, or for any one elſe that ſhall any way amplifie his City or State. Beſides he ought in the fit times of the year entertain the people with Feaſts and Maſkes; and becauſe every City is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into Companies, and arts, and Tribes, he ought to take ſpecial notice of thoſe bodies, and ſome times afford them a meeting, and give them ſome proof of his humanity, and magnificence; yet withall holding firme the majeſtie of his State; for this muſt never fail in any caſe.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>IT is no ſmall importance to a Prince, the choyce he makes, of ſervants being ordinarily good or bad, as his wiſdome is, And
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:30490:326"/>
firſt conjecture one gives of a great man, and of his underſtanding, is, upon the ſight of his followers and ſervants he hath about him, when they prove able and faithful, and then may he alwaies be reputed wiſe becauſe he hath known how to diſcern thoſe that are able, and to keep them true to him. But when they are otherwiſe, there can be no good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture made of him; for the firſt error he commits, is in this choyce. There was no man that had any knowledge of <hi>Antony</hi> of <hi>Vanafro,</hi> the ſervant of <hi>Pandulfus Petrucci</hi> Prince of <hi>Siena,</hi> who did not eſteem <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulfus</hi> for a very diſcreet man, having him for his ſervant. And becauſe there are three kinds of underſtandings; the one that is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed by it ſelf; the other that underſtands when it is informed by another; the third that neither is adviſed by it ſelf nor by the demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of another; the firſt is beſt, the ſecond is good, and the laſt quite unprofitable. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was of neceſſity, that if <hi>Pandulfus</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taind not the firſt degree, yet he got to the ſecond; for whenever any one hath the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to diſcerne between the good and the evil, that any one does and ſayes, however that he hath not his invention from himſelf, yet ſtill comes he to take notice of the good or evil actions of that ſervant; and thoſe he cheriſhes, and theſe he ſuppreſſes; inſomuch that the ſervant finding no means to deceive his maſter, keeps himſelf upright and honeſt. But how a Prince may throughly underſtand his ſervant, here is the way that never fails. When thou ſeeſt the ſervant ſtudy more for his own advantage than thine, and that in all his actions, he ſearches moſt after
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:30490:326"/>
his own profit; this man thus qualified, ſhall never prove good ſervant, nor canſt thou ever relie upon him: for he that holds the Sterne of the State in hand, ought never call home his cares to his own particular, but give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf wholly over to his Princes ſervice, nor ever put him in minde of any thing not appertaining to him. And on the other ſide the Prince to keep him good to him, ought to take a care for his ſervant, honoring him, enriching, and obliging him to him, giving him part both of dignities and offices, to the end that the many honors and much wealth beſtowed on him, may reſtrain his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires from other honors, and other wealth, and that thoſe many charges cauſe him to fear chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that may fall, knowing he is not able to ſtand without his maſter. And when both the Princes and the ſervants are thus diſpoſed, they may rely the one upon the other: when otherwiſe, the end will ever prove hurtfull for the one as well as for the other.</p>

                     <p>I Will not omit one principle of great inpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, being an errour from which Princes with much difficulty defend themſelves, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they be very diſcreet, and make a very good choice; and this is concerning flatterors; whereof all writings are full: and that becauſe men pleaſe themſelves ſo much in their own things, and therein cozen themſelves, that very hardly can they eſcape this peſtilence; and deſiring to eſcape it, there is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:30490:327"/>
of falling into contempt; for there is no other way to be ſecure from flattery, but to let men know, that they diſpleaſe thee not in telling thee truth: but when every one hath this leave, thou loſeſt thy reverence. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought a wiſe Prince take a third courſe, making choyce of ſome underſtanding men in his State, and give only to them a free liberty of ſpeaking to him the truth; and touching thoſe things only which he inquires of, and nothing elſe; but he ought to be inquiſitive of every thing, and hear their opinions, and then afterwards adviſe himſelf after his own manner; and in theſe deliberations, and with every one of them ſo carrie himſelf, that they all know, that the more freely they ſhall ſpeak, the better they ſhall be liked of: and beſides thoſe, not give eare to any one; and thus purſue the thing reſolved on, and thence continue obſtinate in the reſolution taken. He who does otherwiſe, either falls upon flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, or often changes upon the varying of opinions, from whence proceeds it that men conceive but ſlightly of him. To this purpoſe I will alledge you a moderne example. <hi>Peter Lucas</hi> a ſervant of <hi>Maximilians</hi> the preſent Emperor, ſpeaking of his Majeſty, ſaid that he never adviſed with any body, nor never did any thing after his own way: which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he took a contrary courſe to what we have now ſaid: for the Emperor is a cloſe man, who communicates his ſecrets to none, nor takes counſel of any one; but as they come to be put in practiſe, they begin to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered &amp; known, and ſo contradicted by thoſe that are near about him; and he as being an eaſy man, is quickly wrought from them.
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:30490:327"/>
Whence it comes that what he does to day, he undoes on the morrow; and that he never underſtands himſelf what he would, nor what he purpoſes, &amp; that there is no grounding upon any of his reſolutions. A Prince therefore ought alwayes to take counſell, but at his owne plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, &amp; not at other mens; or rather ſhould take away any mans courage to adviſe him of any thing, but what he askes: but he ought well to aske at larger and then touching the things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quird of, be a patient heare, of the truth; and perceiving that for ſome reſpect the truth were conceald from him, be diſpleaſed thereat. And becauſe ſome men have thought that a Prince that gaines the opinion to bee wiſe, may bee held ſo, not by his owne naturall indowments, but by the good counſells he hath about him; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out queſtion they are deceivd; for this is a generall rule and never failes, that a Prince who of himſelfe is not wiſe, can never be well adviſed, unleſſe he ſhould light upon one alone, wholly to direct and govern him, who himſelf were a very wiſe man. In this caſe it is poſſible he may be well governd: but this would laſt but little: for that governor in a ſhort time would deprive him of his State; but a Prince not having any parts of nature, being adviſed of more then one, ſhall never be able to unite theſe counſels: of himſelf ſhall he never know how to unite them; and each one of the Counſellers, probably will follow that which is moſt properly his owne; and he ſhall never find the meanes to amend or diſcerne theſe things; nor can they fall out otherwiſe, becauſe men alwayes prove miſchievous, unleſſe upon ſome neceſſity they
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:30490:328"/>
be force'd to become good: we conclude there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that counſells from whenceſoever they proceed, muſt needs take their beginning from the Princes wiſdome, and not the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Prince from good counſells.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In this Chapter our Authour preſcribes ſome rules how to avoyd flattery, and not to fall into contempt. The extent of theſe two extreames is ſo large on both ſides, that there is left hut a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry narrow path for the right temper to walke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them both: and happy were that Prince, who could light on ſo good a Pilote as to bring him to Port between thoſe rocks and theſe quicksands. Where Majeſty becomes familiar, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe endued with a ſupereminent vertue, it loſes all awfull regards: as the light of the Sunne, becauſe ſo ordinary, becauſe ſo common, we ſhould little value, were it not that all Creatures feele themſelves quickned by the rayes thereof. On the other ſide,</hi> Omnis inſipien arrogantiâ &amp; plauſibus capitur, <hi>Every foole is taken with his owne pride and others flatteryes: and this foole keeps company ſo much with all great wiſe men, that hardly with a candle and lantern can they be diſcernd betwixt. The greateſt men are more ſubject to groſſe and palpable flatteries; and eſpecially the greateſt of men, who are Kings and Princes: for many ſeek the Rulers favour.</hi> Prov. 28. 26. <hi>For there are divers meanes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by private men are inſtructed; Princes have not that good hap: but they whoſe inſtruction is of moſt importance, ſo ſoone as they have taken the government upon them, no longer ſuffer any reproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers: for but few have acceſſe unto them, and they who familiary converſe with them, doe and ſay all for favour.</hi> Iſocrat. <hi>to</hi> Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:30490:328"/>
                        <hi>All are afraid to give him occaſion of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, though by telling him truth.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Plutarch.</hi> de adula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tore &amp; amico ciſcernendo.</note> 
                        <hi>To this purpoſe therefore ſayes one; a Prince excells in learning to ride the great horſe, rather than in any other exerciſe, becauſe his horſe being no flatterer, will ſhew him he makes no difference between him and another man, and unleſſe he keepe his ſeate well, will lay him on the ground. This is plaine dealing. Men are more ſubtile, more double-heatred, they have a heart and a heart, netiher is their tongue their hearts true interpreter. Counſell in the heart of man is like deepe waters; but a man of underſtanding will draw is out.</hi> Prov. 20. 5. <hi>This underſtanding is moſt requiſite in a Prince, in as much as the whole Globe is in his hand, and the inferiour Orbes are ſwayed by the motion of the higheſt. And therefore ſurely it is the honour of a King to ſearch out ſuch a ſecret:</hi> Prov. 25. 2. <hi>His counſellours are his eyes and eares; as they ought to be dear to him, ſo they ought to be true to him, and make him the true report of things without diſguiſe. If they prove falſe eyes, let him pluck them out; he may as they uſe glaſſe eyes, take them forth without paine, and ſee never a whit the worſe for it. The wiſdome of a Princes Counſellours is a great argument of the Princes wiſdome. And being the choyce of them imports the Princes credit and ſafety, our Authour will make him amends for his other errours by his good advice in his 22. Chap. whether I referre him.</hi>

                        <p>Wherefore the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> have loſt their States.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>WHen theſe things above ſaid are well obſerv'd, they make a new Prince ſeeme as if he had been of old, and preſently render him more ſecure and firme in the State, than if he had already grown ancient therein: for a new Prince is much more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervd in his action, than a Prince by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance; and when they are known to bee vertuous, men are much more gaind and oblig'd to them thereby, than by the antiquity of their blood: for men are much more taken by things preſent, than by things paſt, and when in the preſent they find good, they content themſelves therein, and ſeeke no further; or rather they undertake the defence of him to their utmoſt, when the Prince is not wanting in other matters to himſelf; and ſo ſhall he gaine double glory to have given a beginning to a new Principality, adornd, and ſtrengthnd it with good lawes, good arms, good friends, and good examples; as he ſhall have double ſhame, that is born a Prince, and by reaſon of his ſmall diſcretion hath loſt it. And if we ſhall conſider thoſe Lords, that in <hi>Italy</hi> have loſt their States in our dayes, as the King of <hi>Naples,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> and others; firſt we ſhall find in them a common defect, touching their armes, for the reaſons which have been above diſcourſd at length. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards we ſhall ſee ſome of them, that either ſhall have had the people for their enemies; or be it they had the people to friend, could
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:30490:329"/>
never know how to aſſure themſelves of the great ones: for without ſuch defects as theſe, States are not loſt, which have ſo many nerves, that they are able to maintaine an army in the feld. <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon,</hi> not the father of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, but he that was vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by <hi>Titus Quintius,</hi> had not much State in regard of the greatneſſe of the <hi>Romanes</hi> and of <hi>Greece</hi> that aſſail'd him; nevertheleſſe in that he was a warlike man and knew how to entertaine the people, and aſſure himſelf of the Nobles, for many yeares he made the warre good againſt them: and though at laſt ſome town perhaps were taken from him, yet the Kingdome remaind in his hands ſtill. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe our Princes who for many yeares had continued in their Principalities, for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing afterwards loſt them, let them not blame Fortune, but their own ſloth; becauſe they never having thought during the time of quiet, that they could ſuffer a change (which is the common fault of men, while faire weather loſts, not to provide for the tempeſt) when afterwards miſchiefes came upon them, thought rather upon flying from them, than upon their defence, and hop'd that the people, weary of the vanquiſhers inſolence, would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call them: which courſe when the others faile, is good: but very ill is it to leave the other remedies for that: for a man wou'd never go to fall, beleeving another would come to take him up: which may either not come to paſſe, or if it does, it is not for thy ſecurity, becauſe that defence of his is vile, and depends nor upon thee; but thoſe defences only are good, certaine, and durable, which depend upon thy owne ſelfe, and thy owne vertues.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XXV.</head>
                     <argument>
                        <p>How great power Fortune hath in humane, affaires, and what meanes there is <hi>to</hi> reſiſt it.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IT is not unknown unto me, how that many have held opinion, and ſtill hold it, that the affaires of the world are ſo governd by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and by God, that men by their wiſdome cannot amend or alter them; or rather that there is no remedy for them: and hereupon they would think that it were of no availe to take much paines in any thing, but leave all to be governd by chance. This opinion hath gain'd the more credit in our dayes, by reaſon of the great alteration of things, which we have of late ſeen, and do every day ſee, beyond all humane conjecture: upon which, I ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times thinking, am in ſome paret inclind to their opinion: nevertheleſſe not to extinguſh quite our owne free will, I think it may be true, that Fortune is the miſtriſſe of one halfe of our actions; but yet that ſhe lets us have rule of the other half, or little leſſe. And I liken her to a precipitous torrent, which when it rages, over-flows the plaines, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrowes the trees, and buildings, removes the earth from one ſide, and laies it on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, every one flyes before it, every one yeelds to the fury thereof, as unable to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it; and yet however it be thus, when the times are calmer, men are able to make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion againſt theſe exceſſes, with banks and fences ſo, that afterwards when it ſwels again, it ſhall all paſſe ſmoothly along, within its channell, or elſe the violence thereof ſhall not prove ſo licentious and hurtfull. In like manner befals it us with fortune, which there ſhewes
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:30490:330"/>
her power where vertue is not ordeind to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt her, and thither turnes ſhe all her forces, where ſhe perceives that no proviſions nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtances are made to uphold her. And if you ſhall conſider <hi>Italy,</hi> which is the ſeat of theſe changes, and that which hath given them their motions, you ſhall ſee it to be a plaine field, without any trench or bank; which had it been fenc'd with convenienent vertue as was <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, Spain</hi> or <hi>France;</hi> this inundation would never heave cauſd theſe great alterations it hath, or elſe would it not have reach'd to us: and this ſhall ſuffice to have ſaid, touching the oppoſing of fortune in generall. But reſtraining my ſelfe more to particulars, I ſay that to day we ſee a Prince proſper and flouriſh and to morrow utterly go to ruine; not ſeeing that he hath alterd any condition or quality; which I beleeve ariſes firſt from the cauſes which we have long fince run over, that is becauſe that Prince that relies wholly upon fortune, runnes as her wheele turnes. I beleeve alſo, that he proves the fortunate man, whoſe manner of proceeding meets with the quality of the time; and ſo likewiſe he unfortunate from whoſe courſe of proceeding the times differ: for we ſee that men, in the things that induce them to the end, (which every one propounds to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, as glory and riches) proceed therein di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly; ſome with reſpects, others more bold, and raſhly; one with violence, and the other with cunning; the one with patience, th'other with its contrary; and every one by ſeverall wayes may attaine thereto; we ſee alſo two ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by reſpective and wary men, the one come to his purpoſe, and th'other not; and in like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner two equally proſper, taking divers courſe;
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:30490:331"/>
the one being wary the other headſtrong; which proceeds from nothing elſe, but from the quality of the times, which agree, or not, with their proceedings. From hence ariſes that which I ſaid, that two working diverſly, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the ſame effects &amp; two equaly working, the one attains his end, the other not. Hereupon alſo depends the alteration of the good; for if to one that behaves himſelf with warineſſe and patience, times and affaires turne ſo favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably, that the carriage of his buſineſſe prove well, he proſpers; but if the times and affaires chance, he is ruind, becauſe he changes not his manner of proceeding: not is there any man ſo wiſe, that can frame himſelfe hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; as well becauſe he cannot go out of the way, from that whereunto Nature inclines him: as alſo, for that one having alwayes proſperd, walking ſuch a way, cannot be perſwaded to leave it; and therefore the reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive and wary man, when it is fit time for him to uſe violence and force, knows not how to put it in practice, whereupon he is ruind: but if he could change hi diſpoſition with the times and the affaires, he ſhould not change his fortune. Pope <hi>Julius</hi> the ſecond proceeded in all his actions with very great violence, and found the times and things ſo conformable to that his manner of proceeding that in all of them he had happy ſucceſſe. Conſider the firſt exploit he did at <hi>Bolonia,</hi> even while <hi>John Bentivolio</hi> lived: the <hi>Venetians</hi> were not well contented therewith; the King of <hi>Spain</hi> likewiſe with the <hi>French,</hi> had treated of that enterpriſeſ; and nowithſtanding al this, he ſtirrd up by his own rage and fierceneſſe, perſonally undertook that expedition: which
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:30490:331"/>
action of his put in ſuſpence and ſtopt <hi>Spaine</hi> and the <hi>Venetians;</hi> thoſe for feare, and the others for deſire to recover the Kingdome of <hi>Naples;</hi> and on the other part drew after him the King of <hi>France;</hi> for that King ſeeing him already in motion, and deſiring to hold him his friend, whereby to humble the <hi>Venetians,</hi> thought he could no way deny him his ſouldiers, without doing him an open injury. <hi>Julius</hi> then effected that with his violent and heady motion, which no other Pope with all humane wiſdome could ever have done; for it he had expected to part from <hi>Rome</hi> with his concluſions ſettled, and all his affaires ordered before hand, as any other Pope would have done, he had never brought it to paſſe: For the King of <hi>France</hi> would have deviſed a thouſand excuſes, and others would have put him in as many feares. I will let paſſe his other actions, for all of them were alike, and all of them prov'd lucky to him; and the brevity of his life never ſufferd him to feele the contrary: for had he litt upon ſuch times afterwards, that it had been neceſſary for him to proceed with reſpects, there had been his utter ruine; for he would never have left thoſe wayes, to which he had been naturally inclind. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude then, fortune varying, and men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing ſtill obſtinate to their own wayes, prove happy, while theſe accord together: and as they diſagree, prove unhappy: and I think it true, that it is better to be heady than wary; becauſe Fortune is a miſtreſſe; and it is neceſſary, to keep her in obedience to ruffle and force her: and we ſee, that ſhe ſuffers her ſelf rather to be maſterd by thoſe, than by others that proceed coldly. And therefore,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:30490:332"/>
as a miſtreſſe, ſhee is a friend to young men, becauſe they are leſſe reſpective, more rough, and command her with more boldneſſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I have conſidered the 25 Chapter, as repreſenting me a full view of humane policy and cunning: yet me thinks it cannot ſatisfie a Christian in the cauſes of the good and bad ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of things. The life of man is like a game at Tables; skill availes much I grant, but that's not all: play thy game well, but that will not winne: the chance thou throwest muſt accord with thy play. Examine this; play never ſo ſurely, play never ſo probably, unleſſe the chance thoucaſtest, lead thee forward to advantage, all hazards are loſſes, and thy ſure play leaves thee in the lurch. The ſum of this is ſet down in</hi> Eccleſiaſtes chap, 9. v. 11. <hi>The race is not to the ſwift, nor the battell to the ſtrong; neither yet bread to the wiſe, nor yet riches to men of underſtanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance hapeneth to them all. Our cunning Author for all his exact rules he delivere in his books, could not fence againſt the despight of Fortune, as he complaines in his Epiſtle to this booke. Nor that great example of policy, Duke</hi> Valentine, <hi>whome cur Author com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends to Princes for his crafts-maſter, could ſo ruffle or force his mistreſſe Fortune, that he could keep her in obedience. Man can contribute no more to his actions that vertue and wiſdome: but the ſucceſſe depends upon a power above. Surely there is the finger of god; or as</hi> Prov. 16. v. 33. <hi>The lot is caſt into the lap, but the whole diſpoſing thereof is of the Lord. It was nor</hi> Joſephs <hi>wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome made all things thrive under his hand; but becauſe the Lord was with him, &amp; that which he did, the Lord made it to proſper,</hi> Gen 39. <hi>Surely
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:30490:332"/>
this is a bleſſing proceeding from the divine providence, which beyond humane capacity ſo coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perateth with the cauſes, as that their effects prove anſwerable, and ſometimes (that we may know there is ſomething above the ordinary cauſes) the ſucceſs returns with ſuch a ſupereminency of worth, that it far exceeds the vertue of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary cauſes.</hi>

We ſee how ſhe makes her prayers to God, that he ſend ſome one to redeem her from theſe Barbarous cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties and inſolencies.

And though thoſe men were very rare and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable, yet were they men, and every one of them began upon leſs occaſion than this; for neither was their enterprize more juſt than this, nor more eaſie; nor was God more their friend, than yours. Here is very great juſtice:
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:30490:333"/>
for that war is juſt, that is neceſſary; and thoſe armes are religious, when there is no hope left otherwhere, but in them. Here is an exceeding good diſpoſition thereto: nor can there be, where there is a good diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a great difficulty, provided that uſe be made of thoſe orders, which I propounded for aim and direction to you. Beſides this, here we ſee extraordinary things without example effected by God; the ſea was opened, a cloud guided the way, devotion poured forth the waters, and it rain'd down Manna; all theſe things have concurred in your greatneſs, the reſt is left for you to do. God will not do eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing himſelf, that he may not take from us our free will, and part of that glory that belongs to us. Neither is it a marvel, if any of the aforenamed <hi>Italians</hi> have not been able to compaſs that, which we may hope your illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous family ſhall: though in ſo many revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Italy,</hi> and ſo many feats of war, it may ſeem that the whole military vertue therein be quite extinguiſht; for this ariſes from that the ancient orders thereof were not good; and there hath ſince been none that hath known how to invent new ones. Nothing can ſo much honor a man riſing a new, as new laws and new ordinances deviſed by him: theſe things when they have a good founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion given them, and contain in them their due greatneſs, gain him reverence and admiration; and in <hi>Italy</hi> their wants not the matter where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to introduce any forme.

but when they come to armies, they appear not, and all proceeds from the weakneſs of the Chieftaines; for they that underſtand the managing of theſe matters, are not obeyed; and every one preſumes to underſtand; hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to there having not been any one ſo highly rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed either by fortune or vertue, as that others would ſubmit unto him. From hence proceeds it, that in ſo long time, and in ſo many battels fough for theſe laſt paſt 20 years, when there hath been an army wholly <hi>Italian,</hi> it alwaies hath had evil ſucceſs; whereof the river <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> firſt was witneſs, afterwards <hi>Alexandria, Capua, Genua, Vayla, Bolonia, Meſtri.</hi> Your Illuſtrious family then being deſirous to tread the footſteps of theſe worthyes who redeem'd their countreys, muſt above all things as the very foundation of the whole ſabrick, be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with ſoldiers of your own natives: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you cannot have more faithful, true, nor better ſoldiers; and though every one of them be good, all together they will become better when they ſhall find themſelves entertained, commanded, and honored by their own Prince. Wherefore it is neceſſary to provide for thoſe armes, whereby to be able with the <hi>Italian</hi> valor to make a defence againſt forrei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. And however the <hi>Swiſſe</hi> infantry and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> be accounted terrible; yet is there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in both of them, by which a third order might not only oppoſe them, but may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident to vanquiſh them: for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are not able to indure the Horſe, and the <hi>Swiſſe</hi> are to feare the foot, when they incounter with them, as reſolute in the fight as they; whereupon it hath been ſeen, and upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience ſhall be certain, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
                        <pb n="121" facs="tcp:30490:334"/>
are not able to beare up againſt the French Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valery, and the <hi>Swiſſes</hi> have been routed by the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Foot. And though touching this laſt, there hath not been any entire experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence had, yet was there ſome proof thereof given in the battel of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> when the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Foot affronted the <hi>Dutch</hi> battalions, which keep the ſame rank the <hi>Swiſſes</hi> do, where the <hi>Spaniards</hi> with their nimbleneſs of body, and the help of their targets entred in under their Pikes, and there ſtood ſafe to offend them, the <hi>Dutch</hi> men having no reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: and had it not been for the Cavalery that ruſht in upon them, they had quite defeated them. There may then (the defect of the one and other of theſe two infantries being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverd) another kind of them be a new or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, which may be able to make reſiſtance againſt the Horſe, and not fear the Foot, which ſhall not be a new ſort of armes, but change of orders. And theſe are ſome of thoſe things which ordained a new, gain reputation and greatneſs to a new Prince. Therefore this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhould not be let paſs, to the end that <hi>Italy</hi> after ſo long a time may ſee ſome one redeemed of hers appear. Nor can I expreſs with what dearneſs of affection he would be received in all thoſe countreys which have ſuffered by thoſe forrein ſcums, with what thirſt of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, with what reſolution of fidelity, with what piety, with what tears. Would any gates be ſhut again him? Any people deny him obedience? Any envy oppoſe him? Would not every <hi>Italian</hi> fully conſent with him? This government of the <hi>Barbarians</hi> ſtinks in every ones noſtrils. Let your Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious Family then undertake this worthy

For all of them have been either expoſed to the mercy of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage creatures, or had ſuch baſe Sires, that as aſhamed of them, they have feigned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſons to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> or ſome other Diety; who theſe have been, every one having know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of many of them, we ſhall omit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, as ſuperfluous, yeelding rather diſtaſte than delight to the Reader. I am indeed of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion

that it proceeds from hence, <hi>viz</hi> in that fortune willing to demonſtrate unto the world, that ſhe, and not wiſdome, gives men their greatneſs, therefore begins to ſhew her ſtrength at ſuch a time, when wiſdome can challenge no intereſt, but all rather is to be attributed as due to her alone. <hi>Caſtruccio Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracani</hi> of <hi>Lucca</hi> was then one of thoſe, who in regard of the times he liv'd in, and the City where he was borne, effected very great matters, and had, as others in this kind, neither a very fortunate nor known birth, as in my further diſcourſe of his life it ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear: which I thought fit to bring to memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as having found therein a ſubject of very great example, as well in regard of valor, as fortune. And I thought I might the better direct this diſcourſe unto you two, who of all that I know moſt delight in ſuch glorious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements. I ſay then, that the Family of the <hi>Caſtracani</hi> is reckoned among the noble Families of the City of <hi>Lucca,</hi> however that in theſe daies it be much decayed, according to the courſe of all other worldly things. Of this there was one <hi>Antony</hi> borne, who took upon him religious orders, and was a <hi>Canon</hi> of S. <hi>Michaels</hi> at <hi>Lucca,</hi> and in honor there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was entituled Maſter <hi>Antony.</hi> He had but one ſiſter, who was married to <hi>Buonaccorſo Cennami;</hi> but <hi>Bnonaccorſo</hi> being dead, and ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining a widow, betook her ſelf to live with her brother, with intention not to marry any more. Mr. <hi>Antony</hi> had behind his houſe where he dwelt, a vinyard, whereinto by reaſon of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers gardens bordering thereupon on ſeveral ſides, the paſſage was very ordinary. It happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that one morning a little after the Sun riſe,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:30490:336"/>
Dame <hi>Dionora,</hi> for ſo was Maſter <hi>Antonies</hi> ſiſter called, walking out into the vineyard, as ſhe was gathering ſome herbs, after the manner of women, to make a ſallet withall; ſhe heard ſomekind of ruſſeling under a vine amongſt the leaves, and caſting her eye that way, ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſome little cry there, whereupon draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near to the noiſe, ſhe diſcoverd the hands and face of an infant wrapt in the vine leaves, which ſeemed as if it asked her aſſiſtance: ſo that ſhe partly marvailing, partly frighted, full of pitty and amazement, took it up in her armes, and having carried it home, and waſh'd it, and ſwadled it in clean clouts, as they uſe children, at her return preſented it to Maſter <hi>Antony:</hi> who conſidering the accident, and ſeeing the child, was as much amaz'd and compaſſionate as was his ſiſter: and adviſing together what they ſhould do in this caſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to bring it up, he being a Prieſt, and ſhe not having any children. Having then taken a nurſe into the houſe, they nouriſhed it with as much tenderneſs as if it had been their own child; and cauſing it to be baptized, named it <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> after the name of their own father. <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> as he increaſed in years, ſo he grew in perſon and feature, and in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing he ſhewed wit and diſcretion: and quickly, according to his age, he learned what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever his Maſter <hi>Antony</hi> taught him: who pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing to make him a Prieſt, and to turne over unto him his Canonicate, and his other benifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, inſtructed him in that way: but he found him not a ſubject fit for that regular life: For ſo ſoon as <hi>Castruccio</hi> came to 14 years of age, he began to grow a little maſterfull towards Maſter <hi>Antony</hi> and Dame <hi>Dionora,</hi> ſo
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:30490:337"/>
that he ſtood no longer in fear of them, laying aſide all Church books, he began to handle armes, and took not delight in any thing more than to mannage them, or with others his equals to run, leap, or wraſtle, and ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like exerciſes: wherein he ſhewed ſuch courage and ſtrength, that he far ſurpaſſed all others of his age; and if any time he gave himſelf to reading, he took pleaſure in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe than diſcourſes of wars, and the actions of moſt famous men: for which cauſe Maſter <hi>Antony</hi> was much greived at heart. In the Citty of <hi>Lucca</hi> there happened to dwell a Gentleman of the Family of the <hi>Guinigi,</hi> call'd Maſter <hi>Francis,</hi> who for fortunes, eſteem, and valour, out-went all others the Citizens of <hi>Lucca:</hi> who was alwaies traind up in bearing of armes, and who had a long time ſerv'd under the Vlſcounts of <hi>Milan;</hi> and becauſe he was a <hi>Gibelline,</hi> he was accounted of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>above all that followed that faction in <hi>Lucca.</hi> This man being then in <hi>Lucca,</hi> and aſſembling morning and evening with the reſt of the citizens under the Governors Palace, which is in the head of the Palace of S. <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael,</hi> being the prime place of <hi>Lucca,</hi> often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſaw <hi>Castruccio</hi> uſing of thoſe exerciſes with other lads of the town, wherein I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſaid he took delight; and perceiving that beſides the maſtring of them, he held over them a kind of Princely authority, and that they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain lov'd and reverenc'd him, he became very deſirous to know what he was, whereof being inform'd by ſome there preſent, he became the more deſirous to take him home to him; and calling him one day to him, ask'd him, where he had rather live, either in a Cavaliers houſe,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:30490:337"/>
where he might learn to ride and uſe his armes, or abide in a Prieſts houſe, where nothing elſe were to be heard but their Offices and Maſſes? Maſter <hi>Francis</hi> perceiv'd how much <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> was cheared upon the mention of horſes and armes; yet he ſtanding a little out of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, Maſter <hi>Francis</hi> again encouraging him to ſpeak, he anſwered, that if his Patron would therewith be content, he could not have a greater pleaſure than to quit this calling of Prieſt, and betake himſelf to that of a ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier. Maſter <hi>Francis</hi> was much ſatisfied with this reply: and in a ſhort time ſo negotiated in this matter, that Maſter <hi>Antony</hi> gave him up to his charge, whereunto he was the rather moved by the lads inclination, judging thereby that he could not hold him much longer in his former courſe. <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> then being prefer'd from Mr. <hi>Antony Caſtracani</hi> the Prieſts houſe to the Palace of Mr. <hi>Francis Guinigi</hi> the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, it was a marvail to think in how ſhort a time he attaind to thoſe vertues and good qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, which are required in a compleat Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liere. Firſt he became an excellent horſeman: for he was able to mannage the rougheſt horſe at eaſe; and, though but a youth, in jouſts and tournaments he was of prime remarque; ſo that in any action of ſtrength or activity, none could exceed him. Theſe perfections beſides were ſeaſon'd with ſuch manners, and good qualities, as that touching modeſty, it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible how that either in word or deed he gave no diſtaſt to any; to his ſuperiors he yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded reverence; he was modeſt with his equals, and pleaſant with his inferiors; which gain'd him favor, not only in the whole Family of <hi>Guinigi,</hi> but alſo in the whole City of <hi>Lucca.

Caſtruccio</hi> being then returnd to <hi>Lucca</hi> of far greater eſteem than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his departure he was; failed not (to his power) to gain himſelf friends, practiſing means to win them. But Maſter <hi>Francis Guini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi</hi> now chancing to dye, and having left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him a ſon named <hi>Paul</hi> of 13 years of age, appointed <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> his Tutor, and the Governor of his eſtate; having firſt cauſed him to be called to him before his death, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated him, that he would take upon him the eare to bring up his ſon with that faithfulneſs he had found himſelf; and that what kindneſſes he could not return to the father, he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite to the ſon. And now at length Maſter <hi>Francis Guinigi</hi> being dead, <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> left Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and Governor to <hi>Paul,</hi> grew in ſuch cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit and power, that the favor he was wont to find in <hi>Lucca,</hi> in ſome part was turned into envy, and he was calumniated by many, as who they doubted had ſome projects upon a tyranny. Among whom the Principal was M. <hi>George Opizi,</hi> head of the <hi>Guelfes</hi> faction. This man hoping by the death of Mr <hi>Francis</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main without competitor <hi>in Lucca,</hi> thought that <hi>Caſtruccio,</hi> being left with that truſt, by
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:30490:338"/>
the grace &amp; favor of his diſcreet carriage gaind him, had bereav'd him of all means to attain thereto; and hereupon ſowed many ſeeds of ſcandal againſt him, whereby to choak his well grown credit. Which at firſt <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> diſdai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but afterwards grew jealous of it: for he thought that Maſter <hi>George</hi> would never reſt, till he had ſo far diſgrac'd him with King <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> of <hi>Naples</hi> his Lieuftenant, as to cauſe him to chaſe him out of <hi>Lucca.</hi> At that time there was one <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>guccion</hi> of <hi>Fagginolo</hi> of <hi>Arezo,</hi> then Lord of <hi>Piſa,</hi> who by the <hi>Piſans</hi> was firſt cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen for their commander, and afterwards made himſelf their Lord. Divers out-lawed <hi>Lucche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Gibellin</hi> faction abode with <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>guccion,</hi> whom <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> practiſed to reſtore again with <hi>

Having therefore given order, as was requiſite, to this purpoſe, <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> fortified the tower of the <hi>Honeſti,</hi> and furniſhed it with munition and ſtore of victuals whereby upon occaſion he might be able to defend himſelf therein for ſome time: and the night being come, which was agreed of with <hi>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>guccion</hi> liked beſt, to the great dammage thereof; for it appeard then, that there were above a hundred families chaſed out of <hi>Lucca.</hi> Thoſe that fled, part went to <hi>Florence,</hi> and part to <hi>Piſtoya,</hi> which Cities were then go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by the <hi>Guelfes</hi> faction; and hereupon they became enemies to <hi>

ſhew of feare, and not ſuffering any one to goe out of the trenches: and on the other ſide the <hi>Guelfes</hi> the more they ſaw this feare, the more inſolent they became, and every day being orderd for fight, they preſented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before <hi>Caſtruccios</hi> army, who thinking he had now enough, emboldned them, and having had full notice of what order they kept, reſolved to come to the tryall of a day: and firſt with his ſpeeches he confirmd his ſoldiers courage, and ſhewd them the victory certaine, if they would follow his directious. <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> had ſeene how the enemy had plac'd all his ſtrength in the body of the army, &amp; the weak<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

ſeeing themſelves left naked on each flanke, without having whereupon to ſhew their valour, fled likewiſe. The rout and the ſlaughter were great: for there were ſlaine above ten thouſand men, with many Officers, and great Cavaliers of the <hi>Guelfes</hi> faction throughout all <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> and many Princes who came thither in favour of them: to wit, <hi>Peter,</hi> King <hi>Roberts</hi> Brother, and <hi>Charles</hi> his nephew, and <hi>Philip</hi> Lord of <hi>Taranto:</hi> but of <hi>Caſtruccio's</hi> ſide they came not to above three hundred: among which <hi>Francis <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>guccions</hi> ſonne was ſlaine: who being young and over-venturous, was killd at the firſt onſet. This overthrow much augmented <hi>Caſtruccio's</hi> credit, ſo that <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>guccion</hi> grew ſo jealous and ſuſpitious of his owne State, that he continually buſied his brains how to bring him to deſtruction; thinking with himſelfe that that victory had rather taken his power from him, than ſetled it: and being in this thought, while he awaited ſome fair colour to effect his deſignes, it happned that <hi>Pieragnolo Michaeli</hi> was ſlaine in <hi>Lucca,</hi> a man of good worth and eſteeme, and the <hi>Aſſaſſine</hi> fled into <hi>Caſtruccio's</hi> houſe: where the Captaines and Serjeants going to apprehend him, were affronted, and hindred by <hi>Caſtruccio,</hi> ſo that the murtherer by his ayd eſcaped, which thing <hi>

going familiarly into the commanders pallaces, not fearing any injury, was firſt by <hi>Neri</hi> entertaind at ſupper, and afterwards ſeiſed on.

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>guccion</hi> what was farther to be done in that caſe: who blaming his ſonnes ſlowneſſe and cowardiſe, for the diſpatching hereof went out of <hi>Piſa</hi> with four hundred Horſe towards <hi>Lucca:</hi> and hardly yet was he arriv'd at the <hi>Baths,</hi> but the <hi>Piſans</hi> took armes, and ſlew <hi>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>guccion</hi> was enterd <hi>Lucca,</hi> taking this occaſion to free <hi>Caſtruccio,</hi> firſt began at their meetings in the <hi>Piazze</hi> to ſpeake ſlightly of him, afterwards to make ſome hub-bub, and from thence came to armes, demanding <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> to be ſet free; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>guccion</hi> for feare of worſe, drew him out of priſon: Whereupon <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> ſuddenly rallying his friends, with the peoples favour made an aſſault upon <hi>

favour that he was made Generall of their Forces for a yeare; which being compaſſed, to gaine himſelfe further credit in armes, he purpoſd to recover for the <hi>Luccheſes</hi> ſeverall towne; which rebelld after <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>guccions</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partue, and went alſo by the <hi>Piſans</hi> favour, with whom he had enterd into league at the campe, to <hi>Serezana;</hi> and to winne that he had built over it a fort, which, being after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards changed by the <hi>Florentines,</hi> is now calld <hi>Serezanello,</hi> and in two monthes ſpace tooke the towne, and afterwards in ſtrength of this credit, he wonne <hi>Maſſa, Carrara,</hi> and <hi>Lavenza,</hi> and in ſhort time all <hi>Lunigiana:</hi> and to ſtop the paſſage that comes from <hi>Lombarby</hi> into <hi>Luginiana,</hi> he tooke <hi>Pontremoli</hi> and drew out thence Mr. <hi>Anaſtaſia Palivicini,</hi> who was Lord thereof. Returning then to <hi>Lucca</hi> with this victory, he was met by the whole people: whereupon <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> reſolving not to deferre longer to make himſelfe Prince, by meanes of <hi>Pazzino</hi> of <hi>Poggio Puccinello</hi> of <hi>Porcico, Franciſco Boccanſecehi,</hi> and <hi>Cecco Guinigi</hi> at that time of great repute in <hi>Lucca,</hi> but corrupted by him, made himſelf Lord thereof, and ſo ſolemnely and by reſolution of the people was elected their Prince. At this time <hi>Frederck</hi> of <hi>Baviere</hi> King of the <hi>Romans</hi> came into <hi>Italy</hi> to take the Imperiall crown, whom <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> made his friend, and went to him with five hundred Horſe, having left for his Lieutenant at <hi>Lucca Paulo Guinigi,</hi> whom in remembrance of his father, he made account of as his owne child. <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> was entertaind very honourably by <hi>Frederick,</hi> who gave him many priviledges, and made him his Deputy in <hi>Tuſeany,</hi> and becauſe the <hi>Piſans</hi> had expelld <hi>Gad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do</hi>
                     <pb n="135" facs="tcp:30490:341"/>
of <hi>Gerardeſca,</hi> and for feare of him askd ſuccours of <hi>Frederick,</hi> he made <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> their Lord, whom the <hi>Piſans</hi> accepted for feare of the <hi>Guelfes</hi> faction, and in particular becauſe of the <hi>Florentines. Frederick</hi> then being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into <hi>Germany,</hi> and having left at <hi>Rome</hi> a governour for his affairs in <hi>Italy,</hi> all the <hi>Gibellins</hi> as well <hi>Tuſcans</hi> as <hi>Lomdarbs</hi> that followd the Imperial faction, had their recourſe to <hi>Caſtruccio,</hi> and each promiſd him the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality of their native country; provided that by his meanes they might be reſtord: among whom was <hi>Mattheo Guidi, Nardo Scolare, Lapo <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>berti, Gerozzi Nardi</hi> and <hi>Piero Buonacorſi,</hi> all <hi>Gibellins,</hi> and outlawd <hi>Florentines:</hi> and <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> plotting by helpe of theſe, and with his owne forces to become Lord of all <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> to gaine himſelfe credit the more, entred into amity with Mr. <hi>Metthem Viſcoti</hi> Prince of <hi>Milan:</hi> and traind up all the men ofhis owne city and country to armes: and becauſe <hi>Lucca</hi> had five gates, he divided the country into five parts, armd them, and diſtributed them under Captaines and colours, ſo that on a ſudden he was able to bring together above twenty thouſand men into the field, beſides the help he might have from <hi>Piſa.</hi> He then being environd with theſe forces and freinds, it fortun'd that Mr. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theo Viſconti</hi> was aſſayled by the <hi>Guelfes</hi> of <hi>Piacuza;</hi> who had driven out the <hi>Gibellins,</hi> in whoſe behalfe the <hi>Florentines</hi> and King <hi>Robert</hi> had ſent their troopes. Whereupon Mr. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theo</hi> intreated <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> to affaile the <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,</hi> that they being conſtraind to defend their owne homes, ſhould call back their men out of <hi>Londarby.</hi> So <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> with a good army en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:30490:342"/>
the Vale <hi>Arno,</hi> took <hi>Fucachio,</hi> and St. <hi>Miniato</hi> with great dammage of the country; and upon this occaſion the <hi>Florentines</hi> were forc'd to call back their troopes: who were hardly returnd into <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> but <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> was compeld upon another neceſſity to haſte back to <hi>Lucca.</hi> And in that City the Family of <hi>Poggio</hi> being of ſuch power and authority as that it had made <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> not only great, but Prince alſo, and not taking themſelves to have been requited as they had deſervd, agreed with other Families of <hi>Lucca</hi> to move the city to rebellion, and to chace <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> thence; whereupon taking occaſion one morning they came armd upon the Deputy, whom <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> had there ordaind over Juſtice, and ſlew him, and further purpoſing to raiſe the people to commotion; <hi>Steven</hi> of <hi>Poggio</hi> an arcient and peaceable man, who had no hand at all in this conſpiracy, came be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, conſtrain'd his friends by his autority amongſt them, to lay aſide their arms offering himſelfe to mediate with <hi>Castruccio</hi> for them, that he ſhould ſatisfie their deſires. Thus they layd down their armes, but not with greater diſcretion than they had taken them up; for <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> having had notice of theſe novelties befalne in <hi>Lucca,</hi> without making any delay, with part of his troops, leaving <hi>Paul Guinigi</hi> Commander of the reſidue, came thence to <hi>Lucca,</hi> where having found the tumult appeaſd beyond his expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, deeming he might with the more eaſe ſecure himſelfe, diſpoſed thoſe of his party in ſeverall places, as beſt was for his turne. <hi>Steven</hi> of <hi>Poggio</hi> thinking with himſelfe, that <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> was beholding to him, went to him,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:30490:342"/>
and intreated, not for himſelfe, becauſe he thought it no way needfull for him, but for the others of his Family, praying that many things he would pardon, in reſpect of their youth, and many things in regard of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient amity, and obligation he had to the whole kindred. Wherunto <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> anſwered courteouſly, and bid him be of good cheere, and told him that he received more content the tumult was appeaſed, than he had had trouble that it was rayſed, and perſwaded <hi>Steven</hi> to cauſe them all to come to him, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that he thank'd God he had given him opportunity to make a ſhew of his clemency, and bounty. They all then preſenting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon <hi>Stevens</hi> word and <hi>Castruccios,</hi> were together with <hi>Steven</hi> impriſond, and put to death. In this meane while the <hi>Florentines</hi> had recoverd S. <hi>Miniato;</hi> whereupon <hi>Castruccio</hi> thought fit to ſtay that war: conſidering that as yet he was not ſecure of <hi>Lucca,</hi> being that he could not ſafely part from home; and have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cauſd the <hi>Florentines</hi> to be felt whether they would admit of a truce, he found them eaſily yeelding thereto; for they alſo were weary of the charge, and deſirous to ſtop the expence. Whereupon they made a truce, of two yeares, and that every one ſhould keep what they had gotten. In the meane while <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> being freed from the war, that he might not again incurre thoſe dangers and hazards which formerly he had run, under divers colours and pretences, cut off all thoſe in <hi>Lucca,</hi> who could have any ambition to to aſpire to the Principality, and pardoned not one of them, depriving them of their Country and Fortunes, and thoſe he could
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:30490:343"/>
get in his clutches, of their lives: affirming that he had found it by experience, that none of them would abide true; and for his better ſafeguard, built a Fortreſſe in <hi>Lucca,</hi> and made uſe of the materials of their Towers, whom he had baniſh'd and murdred. While <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> was thus quiet with the <hi>Florentines,</hi> and that he ſtrengthened himſelfe in <hi>Lucca,</hi> he fail'd not to do all that he could, without entring into open hoſtility to increaſe his greatneſſe: and having a great deſire to take <hi>Piſtoya,</hi> think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with himſelfe that by the poſſeſſiou of that City, he had gotten one foot into <hi>Florence,</hi> gain'd himſelfe by divers wayes the whole mountaine to friend, and by the factions he made in <hi>Piſtoya,</hi> ſo behav'd himſelfe, that every one rely'd much on him. At that time the City was divided (as always it was) into the <hi>Bianchi</hi> and <hi>Neri;</hi> head of the <hi>Bianchi</hi> was <hi>Baſtiano</hi> of <hi>Poſſente;</hi> and of the <hi>Neri, James</hi> of <hi>Gia:</hi> each of which held ſtreight correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with <hi>Caſtrucio,</hi> &amp; one deſir'd to expell the other, ſo that the one and the other after many ſuſpicions came to blowes; <hi>James</hi> made himſelfe ſtrong at the gate towards <hi>Florence. Baſtiano</hi> at that towards <hi>Lucca,</hi> and the one and the other of them relying more upon <hi>Castruccio,</hi> than upon the <hi>Florentines,</hi> judging him more ready and quick of diſpatch in any thing touching the warre, each of them ſent to him ſecretly for ayd: which <hi>Castruccio</hi> promis'd to them both, letting <hi>James</hi> know that he would come in perſon, and telling <hi>Baſtiano,</hi> he would ſend <hi>Paul Guinigi</hi> his Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſon: and appointing a ſet time, ſent <hi>Paul</hi> by way of <hi>Peſcia,</hi> and himſelfe went ſtraight on to <hi>Piſtoya;</hi> ſo that about midnight, for thus
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:30490:343"/>
was it agreed between <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> they both arrived at <hi>Pistoya</hi> and there receiv'd as friends: being both entred, when <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> found his time, he gave the watchword to <hi>Paul,</hi> whereupon he ſlew <hi>James</hi> of <hi>Gia,</hi> and the other <hi>Baſtiano</hi> of <hi>Poſſente;</hi> and all their partakers were partly taken, partly ſlaine, whereupon they forced <hi>Piſtoya</hi> without reſiſtance; and for the government of the towne, <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> conſtrained the people to yeeld him obedience, remitting to them many old debts and dutyes, and thus did he to the whole Country there abouts, who all flock't together: partly to ſee the new Prince, ſo that every one fraught with hopes, or admiring his valour, ſet his heart at reſt. It happened about this time, that the people of <hi>Rome</hi> mutinyed upon the extreame dearth of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion there, which was cauſed by the Popes abſence, who was then at <hi>Avignon,</hi> and they blamed the <hi>Germane</hi> government, inſomuch that every day murders and other diſorders were committed, which <hi>Henry</hi> the Emperours Deputy could no way remedy; whereupon he had a great ſuſpicion that the <hi>Romanes</hi> would call in King <hi>Robert</hi> of <hi>Naples,</hi> and chace him from <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſo reſtore it to the Pope: And having no nearer Allie, whom he could make recourſe unto, than <hi>Castruccio,</hi> he ſent to intreat him, that he would be pleaſed, not only to ſend him aid, but to come himſelf alſo in perſon. <hi>Castruccio</hi> thought this voyage was no way to be put off, as well to render ſome ſervice of merit to the Emperour, as becauſe now the Emperour was abſent from <hi>Rome,</hi> there was ſome neceſſity of it: leaving <hi>Paul Guinigi</hi> at <hi>Lucca,</hi> he went thence with two
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:30490:344"/>
hundred horſe to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he was enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd by <hi>Henry,</hi> with very much honour; and his preſence in a ſhort time gave ſo much credit to the Imperials, that without blood or other violence, all things were wel quieted: for <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> having cauſed a good quantity of corne to be brought by ſea out of the Countey about <hi>Piſa,</hi> took away all occaſion of offence. Afterwards, partly by admoniſhing, partly by chaſtſing the cheif Officers of <hi>Rome,</hi> he reduc'd them freely under <hi>Henries</hi> government; &amp; <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruccio</hi> was created a <hi>Roman</hi> Senator, beſides many other honors he received of the people, and that Order he took with very great pomp, putting on a gown of cloth of tiſſue with great letters before to this purpoſe, <hi>This man is what it pleaſes God;</hi> and again behind, <hi>And ſhall be what God will.</hi> In this mean while the <hi>Florentines,</hi> who were diſpleaſed that <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> during the truce, had made himſelf Lord of <hi>Piſtoya,</hi> devis'd which way they might make it rebel, which by reaſon of his abſence, they thought might eaſily be effected. Amongſt the baniſhed <hi>Piſtoyeſes,</hi> who were then at <hi>Florence,</hi> there was <hi>Baldo Cocchi,</hi> and <hi>James Baldini,</hi> both men of authority, and ready for any hazard. Theſe men held correſpondence with ſome friends they had within; ſo that with the <hi>Florentines</hi> helpe they entred by night into <hi>Pistoya,</hi> and chaced thence <hi>Caſtruccios</hi> friends and officers, and ſome of them they ſlew, and reſtored the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty her liberty, which news much diſpleaſed <hi>Caſtruccio;</hi> ſo that having taken leave of <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> he came with his men by great dayes jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys to <hi>Lucca.</hi> The <hi>Florentines</hi> when they had word of <hi>Caſtruccios</hi> return, thinking he
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:30490:344"/>
would not take much reſt, reſolv'd to prevent him, and with their forces to enter firſt into the Vale of <hi>Nievola,</hi> before him: ſuppoſing, that if they firſt made themſelves maſters of that val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, they ſhould cut off from him all means of poſſibility to recover <hi>Piſtoya;</hi> and ſo having put in order a great army of all the friends of the <hi>Guelfes</hi> faction, they came into the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of <hi>Piſtoya.</hi> On the other ſide, <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> came with his troops to Mount <hi>Carlo,</hi> and having learned where the <hi>Florentines</hi> army was, determined not to meet them in the plain of <hi>Piſtoya,</hi> nor to attend them in the plain of <hi>Pſecia,</hi> but if it might be, to encounter them in the ſtraight of <hi>Saravalla;</hi> deeming that by bringing his deſigne to paſs, he ſhould ſurely gain the victory; for he underſtood the <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines</hi> had got together ſome forty thouſand men, and he had made choyce of ſome twelve thouſand out of all his; and however he was confident of his own induſtry, and their valor, yet doubted he, leſt if he ſet on them in a large place, he might be environ'd by the multitude of the enemies. <hi>Saravalla</hi> is a Caſtle between <hi>Peſcia</hi> and <hi>Piſtoya,</hi> plac't upon a hill that ſhuts in the Vale of <hi>Nievole,</hi> not upon the very paſſage, but above to that ſome two bow-ſhots of the place, by which a man paſſes, is more ſtraight than on the ſudden; for of every ſide it riſes gently but in a ſtraight manner, eſpecially upon the hill, where the waters are divided; ſo that twenty men on the one ſide and the other would wholly poſſeſs it. In this place <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> had a deſigne to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with the enemy, as well becauſe his ſmall troops ſhould have the advantage, as not to diſcover the enemy but juſt upon the ſkir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:30490:345"/>
fearing leſt his men ſeeing the number of the enemies, ſhould be ſtartled. Mr. <hi>Manfredi</hi> of the <hi>German</hi> nation, was then Lord of the Caſtle of <hi>Saravalla,</hi> who before that <hi>Caſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio</hi> was Lord of <hi>Piſtoya,</hi> had been leſt in that Caſtle, as in a place that was neuter between the <hi>Luccheſes</hi> and <hi>Piſtoyeſes:</hi> nor afterward befel it either of them to offend him, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing to abide neuter, and not to apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the one or the other: So that for this cauſe, and for that the ſituation was ſtrong, he had kept himſelf thus: but upon this acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> became deſirous to poſſeſs this place. And having very near acquaintance with one of the inhabitants of the place, he ſo appointed his buſineſs with him, that the night before the skirmiſh was to begin, he ſhould take into the town 400 m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n of his, and ſlay the commander; and abiding thus prepared, he ſtirred not his army from Mount <hi>Carlo,</hi> the more to encourage the <hi>Florentines</hi> to paſs, who, becauſe they deſired to carry the war far of from <hi>Piſtoya,</hi> and to bring it into the Vale of <hi>Nievole,</hi> encamped under <hi>Saravalla,</hi> with intintion the day following to paſs the hill, but <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> having without any noyſe taken the Caſtle in the might, p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rted from Mount <hi>Carlo</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout mid-night, and quietly arrived in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at the foot of <hi>Saravalla,</hi> ſo that at the ſame inſtant both the <hi>Florentines</hi> and he began to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend the ſide of the hill. <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> had ſent his infantry by the rode way, &amp; a troop of 400 Horſe he had ſent upon the left hand towards the Caſtle: on the other ſide the <hi>Florentines</hi> had ſent 400 horſe before them, and after thoſe their foot moved, not any way thinking they ſhould find <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> upon the top of the hill; for they
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:30490:345"/>
knew nothing of that he had made himſelf maſter of the Caſtle. Thus at unawares the <hi>Florentine</hi> Horſe having got to the top of the hill diſcovered <hi>Castruccios</hi> Foot, and were ſo near approached them, that they had hardly time to lace on their helmets. Theſe men then that were unprovided, being aſſaild by the others that were prepared, and in order, were fiercely ſet upon, and with much adoe made reſiſtance and indeed ſome few of them made head a while: but ſo ſoon as the noyſe hereof deſended into the <hi>Florentines</hi> camp, all was full of confuſion. The Horſe were oppreſſed by the Foot; the Foot by the Horſe, and their carriages; the Commanders becauſe of the ſtraifneſs of the place could neither ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance nor retire: ſo that no man in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion knew what could or ſhould be done: inſomuch, that the Horſe which were at blowes with the enemies Foot, were cut to pieces, and they not able to defend themſelves becauſe the malignity of the ſcite did not ſuffer them, yet made they reſiſtance more of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity than of valor; for being hemmed in by the mountains on both ſides behind by their friends, and before by their enemies, they had to way open for flight. Hereupon <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruccio</hi> having perceived that his troops were not able to break the enemy, ſent a thouſand Foot by way of the Caſtle, cauſing them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſend with the 400 Horſe which he had ſent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, who ſtruck them ſo rudely upon the flank that the <hi>Florentines</hi> unable longer to reſiſt that violence, vanquiſht rather by the place than by the enemy, all took them to flight; and the flight began from thoſe who were behind towards <hi>Pistoya,</hi> who diſperſing themſelves

all along the plain, every one where he beſt could, provided for his ſafeguard. This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat was very great and bloody; many Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders were taken, among which was <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dino</hi> of <hi>Roſſi, Franceſco Brunnelleſchi,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Toſa,</hi> all noble <hi>Florentines,</hi> and many other <hi>Tuſcans,</hi> beſides divers of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> who being ſent by King <hi>Robert</hi> in favor of the <hi>Guelfes,</hi> ſerved under the <hi>Florentines.</hi> The <hi>Pistoyeſes</hi> hearing of this rout, without delay chaſing out the faction of the <hi>Guelfes,</hi> yeelded themſelves to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruccio.</hi> Who not contented herewith, took <hi>Piato,</hi> and all the Caſtles of the plain, as well on this as on the other ſide of <hi>Arno,</hi> and ſet himſelf down with his army in the plain of <hi>Perettola</hi> ſome two miles off from <hi>Florence,</hi> where he abode many dayes to divide the ſpoyle, and to feaſt for joy of the victory gotten, cauſing moneys to be ſtamped in ſcorn of the <hi>Florentines,</hi> and races to be run by horſe-men and queans: neither faild he to endeavor to corrupt ſome noble Citizens, to open to him in the night the gates of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence;</hi> but the conſpiracy being diſcovered, they were taken and beheaded, among whom was <hi>Thomas Lupacco,</hi> and <hi>Lambertuccio Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcobaldi.</hi> Hereupon the <hi>Florentines</hi> being affrighted upon his defeat, hardly knew any remedy to preſerve their liberty; and to the end they might be ſure of ayd, ſent Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors to <hi>Robert</hi> King of <hi>Naples,</hi> to give him the City, and the Dominion thereof, Which that King accepied of, not ſo much for the honor the <hi>Florentines</hi> had done him, as for that he knew well how much it imported his State that the <hi>Guelfes</hi> faction ſhould maintain the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:30490:346"/>
State of <hi>Tuſcany:</hi> and having agreed with the <hi>Florentines</hi> to have of them two hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand <hi>Florentines</hi> by the year, he ſent <hi>Charles</hi> his ſon with four thouſand Horſe to <hi>Florence:</hi> ſo that the <hi>Florentines</hi> were ſomewhat eaſed of <hi>Caſtruccios</hi> troops: for they were conſtraind to leave their territories and to goe to <hi>Piſa,</hi> there to repreſs a conſpiracy made againſt him by <hi>Benedicto Lanfranſchi,</hi> one of the cheif of <hi>Piſa,</hi> who not being able to endure that his native countrey ſhould be enthralled to a <hi>Luccheſe,</hi> conſpired againſt him, plotting to ſeize upon the Cittadel, and to chaſe out the garriſon, and to ſlay thoſe of <hi>Caſtruccio's</hi> party. But becauſe in ſuch matters, if the ſmall number be fit to keep the ſecret, yet ſuffices it not to put it in execution: while he went about to gain more men to this purpoſe, ſome there were that be wrayed his plot to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struccio:</hi> neithet paſſed this diſcovery without the infamy of <hi>Bonifacio Cerchi and Iohn Guidi Florentines,</hi> who were near neighbors to <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa;</hi> whereupon <hi>Benedicto</hi> being layd hand on, was put to death, and all the reſt of that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily baniſht, and many other Noble Citizens beheaded: and thinking with himſelf that <hi>Piſtoya</hi> and <hi>Piſa</hi> were not very faithfull unto him, he took care both by his induſtry and forces to ſecure himſelf thereof: which gave leiſure to the <hi>Florentines</hi> to recover their ſtrength, and to be able to attend the return of <hi>Charles:</hi> who being arrived, they deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to loſe no longer time, and gatherd ae great number of men; for they called toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to their ayd in a manner all the <hi>Guelfes</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> and made an exceeding great army: of more than 30000 Foot, and 10000 Horſe,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:30490:347"/>
and having adviſed, which were firſt to be aſſaild, either <hi>Piſtoya</hi> or <hi>Piſa,</hi> they reſolved it were better to ſet firſt upon <hi>Piſa,</hi> being a thing more likely to ſucceed, by reaſon of the late con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy there, as alſo of more profit, deeming that if <hi>Piſa</hi> were once gotten, <hi>Piſtoya</hi> would ſoon render it ſelf. The <hi>Florentines</hi> then going forth with this army in the beginning of May 1328, ſuddenly took <hi>Laſtra Signia,</hi> Mount <hi>Lupo,</hi> and <hi>Empoli,</hi> and came with their army to St. <hi>Miniato; Caſtruccio</hi> on the other part perceiving this great army, which the <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi> had brought againe him, was nothing ſtartled, but rather thought that this was the time, when Fortune was to give him in his hand the whole dominion of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving they ſhould have no better ſucceſs in this of <hi>Piſa,</hi> than formerly they had in that of <hi>Serravalle;</hi> and that now they could not hope to repair themſelves again, as then; whereupon aſſembling twenty thouſand Foot and 4000 Horſe, he brought his army to <hi>Fuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chio,</hi> and ſent <hi>Paul Guinigi</hi> with 5000 Foot to <hi>Piſa. Fucchio</hi> is ſeated in a ſtronger place than any other Caſtle, upon the territory of <hi>Piſa,</hi> becauſe it is in the midſt between the <hi>Goſeiana</hi> and the <hi>Arno,</hi> and a little raiſed from the plain; where he abiding, the enemies were not able, unleſs they divided their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my into two parts; to hinder his proviſion either from <hi>Lucca,</hi> or <hi>Piſa;</hi> neither could they but upon diſadvantage either come upon him, or goe towards <hi>Piſa:</hi> for in one caſe, they might be incloſed in the midſt between <hi>Caſtruccios</hi> troops, and thoſe of <hi>Piſa;</hi> in the other caſe, having the <hi>Arno</hi> to paſs, they could not do it with the enemy on their backs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:30490:347"/>
very great danger. And <hi>Castruccio</hi> for their encouragement to undertake the paſſage, had not placed himſelf with his troops along the bank of <hi>Arno,</hi> but a little aſide near unto the walls of <hi>Fucchio,</hi> and had left diſtance enough between the River and him. The <hi>Florentines</hi> having gotten St. <hi>Miniato,</hi> adviſed whether were to be done, either to goe to <hi>Piſa,</hi> or to find out <hi>Caſtruccio;</hi> and having meaſured the difficulties of both courſes, they reſolved to goe and inveſt him; the river <hi>Arno</hi> was ſo low that a man might wade over it; but yet not ſo, but that the infantry was wet to the ſhoulders, and the Horſe even to the ſaddle. Upon the tenth day then of June in the morning, the <hi>Florentines</hi> in battel array, cauſed part of their Cavalery to begin to paſs, and a body of ten thouſand Foot. <hi>Castruccio</hi> who ſtood ready, and intent to what he had in his mind to do, with a battalion of five thouſand Foot, and three thouſand Horſe fell upon them: neither gave he them any time to get out of the water but that he was at blowes with them; he ſent a thouſand light armed Foot up by the bank on that part, under the <hi>Arno,</hi> and a thouſand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove it, the <hi>Florentines</hi> Foot were much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed with the water and weight of their armes, nor had they all yet got over the channel of the river. When ſome of the Horſe had paſſed, by reaſon that they had moord the bottom of the <hi>Arno,</hi> they made the paſſage the uneaſier for them that came af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them; for the bottom proving rotten and miry, ſome of the Horſe came over and over on their riders, and many ſtuck ſo faſt in the mud that they were there ſtabled: whereupon the <hi>Florentine</hi> Commanders ſeeing the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:30490:348"/>
to paſs on that part, cauſed them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire and make proof of a higher part of the river, whereby to find a ſounder bottom, and the channel more favorable for their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage: againſt whom thoſe whom <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> had ſent under the bank, made reſiſtance, who ſlightly armed with targets and darts, in their hands, with huge outcries, wounded them both in the face and breſt, inſomuch that the horſes affrighted both with the cryes and ſtroaks, would in no wiſe paſs forwards, but fell foule one upon another; the fight between <hi>Caſtrucio's</hi> men and thoſe that were already paſt, was ſharp and terrible, andd of each ſide there fell many, and every one uſed all his skill and ſtrength to overcome his adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. <hi>Caſtruccio's</hi> men would force them back into the river; the <hi>Florentines</hi> ſtriv'd to put forwards to make place for others, that being come forth of the water, they might be able to ſtand to the fight, to which obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy there was added the Captains encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. <hi>Caſtrucio</hi> put his men in mind, that theſe were the ſame enemies, which but a little while ago they had beaten at <hi>Seravalle.</hi> The <hi>Florentines</hi> reproached theirs, that they being many, ſhould ſuffer a few to overcome them. But <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> perceiving that the fight laſted, and that his own and his adverſaries were well wearied, and that on each ſide many were hurt and ſlain, he ſent out ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther band of five thouſond Foot, and when he brought them up to the very back of his own that fought, he gave order that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould open, and wheele about, one on the right hand, the other on the left, and ſo retire; which thing done gave room to the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:30490:348"/>
                     <hi>Florentines</hi> to advance and gain ſome ground. But when once they came to handy blowes, the freſh men with thoſe that were tir'd, they ſtaid not long ere they forc'd them back into the river, between the Horſe of the one ſide, and the other, yet there was not much advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage: whereupon <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> knowing his own inferior, had given order to the leaders, that they ſhould only maintain fight, as he that hoped to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome the Foot; which done, he might be able with more eaſe to overcome the Horſe; which out as he purpoſed: for having ſeen the Foot forc'd back into the river, he ſent the reſt of his infantry againſt the enemies Horſe, who with lances and darts wounding them, and the Cavalery alſo preſſing them with greater fury, put them to flight. The <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> Commanders ſeeing the difficulty that their Horſe had to paſs, ſtrove to make their Foot paſs on that part beneath the river, to fight with the flank of <hi>Caſtruccio's</hi> troops. But the channel being deep, and all above already poſſeſt by his men, all this prov'd vain. Whereupon the whole army was put to rout, to <hi>Caſtruccio's</hi> great glory and honor, and of ſo great a multitude there eſcap'd not a third. Many Chieftains were taken, and <hi>Charles</hi> ſon of King <hi>Robert,</hi> together with <hi>Michaelangelo Falconi;</hi> and <hi>Taddeo</hi> of the <hi>Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zi Florentine</hi> Commiſſaries, fled thence to <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poli.</hi> The ſpoyl taken was great, the ſlaughter exceeding great, as a man may imagine in ſuch and ſo great a conflict: for of the <hi>Florentine</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my 20231, &amp; of <hi>Caſtruccio's</hi> part 1570 were left dead upon the place. But Fortune being enemy to his glory, when as ſhe ſhould have given him life, took it from him, and interrupted thoſe
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:30490:349"/>
deſignes which he a long time before had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to put in effect: neither could any thing but death hinder him. <hi>Castruccio</hi> had toyld himſelf all that day in the battel, when at the end thereof all weary and ſweaty, he ſtayd about the port of <hi>Fucchio,</hi> to attend the ſoldiers, as they ſhould return from the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and in perſon receive and thank them, and partly if peradventure any thing ſhould ariſe from the enemies, that they had made head in any place, he might be ready to give order thereto: judgeing it the office of a good Commander, to be the firſt to get a horſe-back, and the laſt to light off. Whereupon he ſtanding expoſed to a wind, which ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about mid-day riſe; upon the <hi>Arno,</hi> and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to be peſtiferous, he was all over chil'd. Which thing not being made account of by him, was the occaſion of his death: for the night following he was taken with a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous feaver, which continually augmenting, and the ſickneſs being judged mortal by all the Phyſitians, and <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> perceiving of it, called <hi>Paul Guinigi,</hi> and ſpake to him theſe words; Had <hi>I</hi> beleeved, my ſon, that Fortune would have cut of my courſe in the midſt of the way, to arrive unto that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which I by my ſo many good ſuce ceſſes had promis'd my ſelf, <hi>I</hi> ſhould have leſs wearied my ſelf; and to thee as I ſhould have left a ſmaller eſtate, ſo alſo fewer enemies, and leſs envy: for I would have been content with the dominion of <hi>Lucca</hi> &amp; <hi>Piſa,</hi> and never ſubdu'd the <hi>Piſtoyeſes,</hi> nor with ſo many injuries provoked the <hi>Florentines;</hi> but by making the one and the other of theſe people my friends, I ſhould have led a life, though not longer,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:30490:349"/>
yet ſurely more quiet; and to thee ſhould I have left an eſtate, though leſs, without doubt more ſecure and firm; but Fortune, who will diſpoſe of all human affairs, gave me not ſo much judgement, that I was able firſt to know it, or ſo much time, that I was able to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come it. Thou haſt heard, for many have told thee, and I never denyed it to thee, how I came into thy fathers houſe, being yet a young lad, and voyd of all thoſe hopes which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very generous ſpirit ought to conceive, and how I was by him brought up, and beloved by him as much as if I had been of his own blood; whereupon under his government <hi>I</hi> became valorous and grew capable of that fortune in which thou haſt and doſt ſee mee: and becauſe at his death, he committed thee and all this fortunes to my fidelity, I have brought thee up with that affection, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed them with that fidelity, that I was and am bound to. And becauſe not only whether that alone which was left thee by thy father, but that alſo which my fortune and valor got, were thine, I never would marry, to the end that the love of children ſhould never take me off, from ſhewing in any part that thankfulneſs towards thy fathers blood, which I thought I was obliged to ſhew. I leave thee therefore a very fair State, whereat I am much pleaſed: but for that I leave it thee weak and unſetled, I am exceedingly grieved there remains to thee the City of <hi>Lucca,</hi> wich will never be content to live under thy government: <hi>Piſa</hi> is alſo thine: wherein there ere men naturally incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and full of treachery: which, however it be divers times accuſtomed to ſerve, yet will it alwaies diſdain to have a <hi>Luccheſe</hi> for its
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:30490:350"/>
Lord. <hi>Piſtoya</hi> likewiſe is left to thee, very little faithfull to thee, becauſe it is divided, and by freſh injuries provok'd againſt our Family. Thou haſt the <hi>Florentines</hi> for thy neighbors, and thoſe offended, and divers waies injuryed by us, and not extinguiſht, to whom the news of my death would be more welcome than the Conqueſt of all <hi>Tuſcany.</hi> Thou canſt not rely upon the Princes of <hi>Milan,</hi> nor upon the Emperor, becauſe they are far hence, lazy, and very ſlow with their ſuccors: wherefore thou oughtſt not to hope in any thing, but in thy own induſtry, and the remembrance of my valor, and in the reputation which this preſent victory gains thee: which if thou ſhalt know with diſcretion how to make uſe of, will ayd thee to make an accord with the <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,</hi> who being affrighted at this preſent defeat, ought with deſire to condiſcend there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: whom though I ſought to make them mine enemies, and thought it would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure me both power and glory, yet thou art by all means to ſeek to gain for thy friends; for their friendſhip will prove thy ſecurity and advantage. It is a thing of very much impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in this world for a man to underſtand his own ſelf, and to know how to meaſure the forces of his own courage and State; and he that finds himſelf unfit for war, ſhould endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor to ſettle his government by the rules of peace, whereunto thou ſhalt do well if by my advice thou addreſs thy ſelf, and ſtrive by this way to enjoy my pains and dangers, which ſhall eaſily prove ſucceſsful to thee, when thou ſhalt account theſe my advertiſements true: and herewithall thou ſhalt be doubly oblig'd to me, firſt that I have left thee this State, and
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:30490:350"/>
ſecondly that <hi>I</hi> have taught thee how to keep it. Afterwards having cauſed thoſe Citizens to come to him, who of <hi>Lucca, Piſa,</hi> and <hi>Piſtoya,</hi> ſerved in the wars under him; and having recommended <hi>Paul Guinigi</hi> to them, and made them ſwear obedience to him, he died; lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to all thoſe, that ever knew him, a happy remembrance of him; and to thoſe that had been his friends, ſo great a deſire of him, that never any Prince, that died at any time, left more. His funerals were moſt honorably ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnized, and he was buried at St. <hi>Franceſco</hi> in <hi>Lucca.</hi> But neither valor, norfortune were ſo favorable to <hi>Paul Gninigi,</hi> as to <hi>Castruccio;</hi> for not long after, he loſt <hi>Piſtoya,</hi> and after <hi>Piſa;</hi> and with much adoe held he the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Lucca:</hi> which continued in his family till <hi>Paul</hi> the grand-child. <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> then was, by what is here ſhewed, a man of rare note, not only for thoſe times he lived in, but for many ages that had paſt long before. He was of a ſtature higher than ordinary, and his limb were well anſwerable each to other; &amp; of ſuch a grace he was in his aſpect, and entertain'd all men with that humanity, that he never ſpake with any that he ſent from him diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; his hair inclin'd to a reddiſh colour, and he wore it always cut above his ears; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in all ſeaſons, whether it raind or ſnew, he went with his head uncover'd; he was very pleaſing to his friends; and terrible to his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, juſt among his ſubjects, treacherous with forreiners: nor where he could vanquiſh by fraud, did he everſtrive to do it by force: for he ſaid the victory, and not the manner how it was got, gaind a man glory; no man enter'd more boldly into dangers, nor was
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:30490:351"/>
more wary to get out of them: and he was wont to ſay, that men ought to prove e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing, but to be aſtoniſh'd at nothing, and that God favors valiant men, who alwaies chaſtiſes the feeble with the mighty. He was alſo very admirable in replying or biting ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or gentily; and as in this kind he ſpared not any, ſo likewiſe, he was nothing mov'd, when himſelf was not ſpared: ſo that we have many things he ſaid wittily, and heard patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as theſe: Having caus'd a Duckat to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for a Starling, and a friend of his repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him for it, ſaid <hi>Castruccio</hi> Thou wouldſt not have given above a peny for it, and his friend ſaying it was true, he reply'd, a Duckat is leſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Having a flatterer about him, and in ſcorn having ſpat upon him, the flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer ſaid, that Fiſher men to take a little Fiſh ſuffer themſelves to be all moyl'd in the Sea; I will let my ſelf be daub'd by a little ſpittle, to catch a Whale: which <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> not only heard patiently, but rewarded. When one told him, that he liv'd too ſumptuonſly; ſaid <hi>Caſtruccio,</hi> if this were a vice, there would not be ſo ſplendid entertainments at the Saints Feaſts. Paſſing through a ſtreet, &amp; ſeeing a young man comming out of a whore-houſe all bluſhing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had been ſeen by him, he ſaid to him, Be not aſham'd when thou goeſt out, but when thou entreſt in. A friend of his giving him a knot to looſe, that was curiouſly tyed, ſaid, O foole, deſt thou think I will looſen ſuch a thing, which being tyed gives me ſo much trouble? <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> ſaying to one that profeſt himſelf a Philoſopher, You are of the condition of dogs, that alwaies go about thoſe who can beſt give them meat; No ſays the party, we are like

Going from <hi>Piſa</hi> to <hi>Ligorne</hi> by water, and a dangerous ſtorme there ariſing, and thereupon being much preplex'd, was reprehended by one of his company as puſillanimons, ſaying himſelf was not afraid of any thing; to whom <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> reply'd, that he nothing marvayl'd thereat; for every one valu'd his life, according to its worth. Being ask'd by onu, what he ſhould do to gaine a good eſteeme? anſwered him; See when thou goeſt to a Feaſt, that a blocke ſit not upon a blocke. When one blaſted that he had read many things, ſaid <hi>Caſtruccio,</hi> It were better thou couldſt brag thou hadſt remembred much.

He was wont to ſay of one who had been a handſome boy, and afterwards became a comely man, that he was too injurious, have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firſt diſtracted the husbands from their wives, and afterwards the wives from their husbands.

When he was alſo under the rule of Maſter <hi>Francis Guinigi,</hi> one of his playfellows ſaying to him, What wilt thou that I ſhall give thee, for a blow on the mouth? <hi>Castruccio</hi> anſwered him, a Helmet. Having cauſd a citizen of <hi>Lucca</hi> to dye, who had helpd him in his riſing to his greatneſſe, when it was ſaid to him, He had ill done to put to death one of his old friends; he reply'd; You are deceivd, I have put to death a new en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emy. <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> commended much thoſe that betrothd wives, but never married them, like men that ſay they will go to Sea, but never do. He ſaid he wondred much at men, that when they bought any veſſell of earth or glaſſe, they found it firſt whether it be good; but in taking a wife they are content only to ſee her. When he was neare death, one asking him, how he would be buried? he anſwered, with my face downwards: for I know, that as ſoon as I am dead, this Country ſhall go upſide down. Being asked, whether he never thought to become a Fryer to ſave his Soule? he ſaid No, for it was ſtrange to him, that <hi>Lazarus</hi> ſhould go to Paradiſe, and <hi>

Being asked, when it was beſt to eate, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the health? he anſwered, if a man be rich when he is hungry; if he be poore, when he may. Seeing a Gentleman a friend of his, that made his ſervant truſſe his points, he ſaid, I hope one day too thou wiltmake his feed thee. Seeing that one had writen upon his houſe in Latine, God keep the wicked hence; ſaid, The maſter then muſt not enter here. Paſſing by a way where there was a little houſe with a great gate, he ſaid, This houſe will run out of doores. Treating with an Ambaſſadour of the

But the <hi>Florentines</hi> for the hate they bare to the <hi>Vitelli</hi> and the <hi>Orſini</hi> upon divers occaſions, not onely clave not to them, but ſent <hi>Nicholas Machiavelli</hi> their Secretary, to offer receipt to the Duke, and aid againſt theſe his new enemies, who was then in <hi>Imola</hi> full of fear, becauſe of a ſudden and beyond his opinion, his ſoldiers being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his enemies, he unarmd met with a war at hand: but having taken heart upon the <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines</hi> profers, he purpoſed to temporiſe, and hold off the war with thoſe few people which he had, and with treaties of agreement, and partly to prepare aides, which he provided two waies, by ſending to the King of <hi>France</hi> for men, and partly by taking into his pay all men at armes, and what others elſe made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion to ſerve a Horſe-back, and to all he gave money.

                     <hi>Orſini,</hi> to expect him at <hi>Sinigallia;</hi> ſhewing them that ſuch ſtrangeneſſe would make their accord to be neither faithfull nor durable; and that he was a man that deſird he might availe himſelfe both of the forces and advice of his friends: and however <hi>Vitellozzo</hi> was very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing, and that his brothers death had taught him, that he ſhould not offend a Prince and afterwards truſt him; nevertheleſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wrought to it by <hi>Paulo Orfino</hi> who had been corrupted by the Duke with gifts and faire promiſes, he agreed to attend him: whereupon the Duke before the 30 day of December, 1502, that he was to goe from <hi>Fano,</hi> communicated his purpoſe to eight of his cheife confidents, among whom were <hi>Don Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael,</hi> and the Lord of <hi>Enna</hi> who was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Cardinal: and gave them charge, that preſently as ſoone as <hi>Vitellozzo, Paulo Orſino,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Gravina,</hi> and <hi>Oliverotto</hi> had met them, each two of them ſhould get one of them between them: conſigning each one by name to certaine two, who ſhould traine them along even into <hi>Sinigallia,</hi> nor ſuffer them to part, till they had brought them to the Dukes lodging, and that they were there taken. He afterwards tooke order that all his Horſe and Foot, which were better than two thouſand Horſe and ten thouſand Foot, ſhould be in the morning at breake of day upon the <hi>Metaure,</hi> a River ſome five miles from <hi>Fano,</hi> where they ſhould attend him; being then the laſt day of Deucmber, pon the <hi>Metaure</hi> with thoſe troops, he cauſd ſome two hundred Horſe to go before him, afterwards the Foot mov'd, and after them himſelfe in perſon, with the reſt of his men at armes. <hi>Fano</hi> and <hi>Sinigallia</hi>
                     <pb n="165" facs="tcp:30490:356"/>
are two Cities of the Matches, ſeituate upon the bank of the <hi>Adriatick</hi> Sea fifteen miles diſtant the one from the other: So that he who goes towards <hi>Sinigallia</hi> hath the Mountaines on his right hand, the feet whereof ſometimes are ſo bounded by the Sea, that between them and the water there remaines but a very ſmall diſtance, and where they are moſt extended, there is not above two miles diſtance. The City of <hi>Sinigallia</hi> from the foot of theſe Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines is not much further than a bow-ſhot, and from the Sea not above a mile diſtant: along the ſide hereof runs alittle river, which waſheth that part of the wals which is toward <hi>Fano,</hi> looking towards the high way, ſo that till it come neare unto <hi>Sinigallia,</hi> it runs for a good part of the way along the Mountaines: and being come neare up to the river that paſſes alongſt by <hi>Sinigallia,</hi> it turnes upon the left hand alongſt the banke thereof: So that running on for the ſpace of a bow-ſhot, it reaches to a bridge, which paſſes that river, and ſtands in front with the gate that enters into <hi>Sinigallia;</hi> not by a right line, but athwart: before the gate there is a bourg of houſes, with a broad place before them, which the bank of the river ſhoulders upon one ſide. So that the <hi>Vitelli</hi> and <hi>Orſini</hi> having given order to attend the Duke, and perſonally to honour him, the better to give way to his men, they retir'd their own into certaine Caſtles, ſome ſix miles from <hi>Sini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gallia,</hi> and had left only <hi>Oliverotto</hi> in <hi>Sinigallia</hi> with his band, which was ſome thouſand Foot, and a hundred and fifty Horſe, which were lodg'd in the bourg before nam'd. Things being thus ordered, Duke <hi>Valentine</hi> came
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:30490:357"/>
thence towards <hi>Sinigallia,</hi> &amp; when the firſt head of the Horſe troops came up to the bridge, they paſs'd it not, but making ſtand, they turnd their horſe, the one part towards the river, the other to the open field, and ſo left a way in the midſt, whereby the infantry paſsd, which without ſtop entred the Town. <hi>Vitelloz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zo, Paulo,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Gravina</hi> upon their mules, accompanied with a few horſe, went to meet the Duke: &amp; <hi>Vitellozzo</hi> diſarmed having a cloak all lined with green, being exceeding melancholy, as preſaging his own death near at hand, cauſed a certain admiration of himſelf in all, the valor of the man being well known, and the fortune he had paſsd; and it is ſaid, that when he left his ſoldiers to come into <hi>Sini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gallia,</hi> there to meet the Duke, that he did in a manner take his laſt leave of them; to his Captains he recommended his houſe, and the welfare thereof, and admoniſhd his Nephews, that they ſhould not ſo much mind the great fortunes of their Family, as the valor of their Anceſtors. Theſe three then being come up to the Duke, and done their obeiſance, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivd by him with a chearfull countenance, and preſently by thoſe, who had charge to look to them, taken between them. But when the Duke ſaw that <hi>Oliverotto</hi> was wanting, who had ſtaid with his men at <hi>Sinigallia,</hi> and attended before at the broad place by his lodging, above the river, to keep them in order, and exerciſe them: he wink'd upon Don <hi>Michael,</hi> to whom the care of <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verotto</hi> was commited, that he ſhould take ſuch order that <hi>Oliverotto</hi> ſhould not eſcape him. Whereupon Don <hi>Michael</hi> rode before, and being come to <hi>Oliverotto,</hi> to told
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:30490:357"/>
him, that now it was not a time to hold his men together out of their lodgings; becauſe then they would be taken from them by the Dukes ſoldiers, and therefore perſwaded him to ſend them to their lodgings, and goe with him to meet the Duke: which when <hi>Oliverotto</hi> had done, the Duke came, and having ſeen ſeen him, called him; to whom <hi>Oliverotto</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made reverence, he joyn'd in troop with the reſt, and entred into <hi>Sinigallia,</hi> where all diſmounting at the Dukes Lodging, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terd with him into a private chamber, they were held priſoners to the Duke, who preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly got a horſeback, and commanded that <hi>Olive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotto</hi> and the <hi>Orſinies</hi> Souldiers ſhould be all rifled. <hi>Oliveroto's</hi> were all pillag'd, by reaſon they were near at hand; thoſe that belong'd to the <hi>Orſini</hi> and the <hi>Vitelli,</hi> being more remote having before heard of the ruine of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, had time to get together, where calling to mind the valor and diſcipline of the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of the <hi>Orſini</hi> and <hi>Vitelli,</hi> joyntly all in one body, in deſpight of the countrey, and their enemies power, they ſav'd themſelves. But the Dukes ſoldiers not ſatisfied with the pillage of of <hi>Oliverotto's</hi> ſoldiers, began to ſack <hi>Sinigal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia.</hi> And had not the Duke by the death of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſtopped their inſolence, they would utterly have ſackt it. But night being come, and all ſtirs quiet, the Duke thought fit to put <hi>Vitellozzo</hi> and <hi>Oliverotto</hi> to death, and having brought them together, cauſed them to be ſtrangled.
