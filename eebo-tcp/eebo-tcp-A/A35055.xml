            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

OR
Youth's <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nconſtancy.</head>
            <p>IN the year 1652. by the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
and tender care of
a moſt loving and indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
Father, 'twas thought
convenient <hi>(Rodolphus</hi>'s
years then making him capable of
Scholaſtick impreſſions) to place
him abroad, not under an illite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
and raw-pated fellow, (of
which ſort the world is too too
full) but by a moſt prudential and
paternal care, he was ſent to a
grave and reverend old Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
a Doctor of Divinity, whoſe
life and learning ſpeaks him ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
eminent: of this old
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65986:4"/>
Gentleman, I may ſay as <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
once ſpake of his Tutor <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle,</hi>
that he owed more to him
than to his natural Father; the
one giving him a life only, the
other learning and reaſon how to
govern and preſerve that life: the
time was more, than in ſuch like
caſes is uſual, that he ſpent under
the grave tuition of this diſcreet
Schoolmaſter: and theſe advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
for a generous improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
was likewiſe very great, and
(eſpecially in thoſe depraved
times) hardly to be parallel'd;
for then was the time when Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
and Treaſon were counted
Piety and Loyalty; then was the
time when the glory of theſe three
Nations lay buried and trampled
under-foot; when the Nobility
and Gentry were hunted by ſo
many Wolves, and enforced to
fly to Rocks and Mountains, to
unfrequented places and dark
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65986:4"/>
Cells, for their ſecurities; I ſay, in
the midſt of theſe horrible tranſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
<hi>Rodolphus</hi> ſound a priviledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
place for an advantageous edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;
a place which by its then
calmneſs, peaceable, and loving
neighborhood, ſeem'd to repreſent
a felicity far above earthly enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
or a pleaſant ſpring, where
for its tranquillity the innocent
birds fly as to their ſanctuary: ſuch
was the harmonious government
and conduct of this wiſe Captain,
that the flouriſhing youth more
delighted in a ſubmiſſive obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
under his commands, than
the rebellious rout did in all their
tyrannizing cruelties: here was
the Loadſtone that drew ſo many
leſſer Luminaries to be its diligent
attendants; nay I may boldly
ſay, that <hi>England</hi> in thoſe times
could ſcarcely afford ſuch a cluſtre
of young Gentry as then lay at
Anchor in that calm and ſmooth
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65986:5"/>
Harbour: 'tis a ſufficient proof
that the Pilot was rarely skilful,
otherwiſe the loſs of ſo many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
Paſſengers had been inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
being forced to ſail through
ſo perillous an Ocean: but thanks
be to the Gods for the ſafe arrival
of theſe Paſſengers into their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
Port, and for our deareſt
Guideſman's ſafe arrival into his
everlaſting Port; the former at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
to theirs by our ever hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Kings return; the other at his
by that <hi>ſigneo canteo,</hi> or ſweet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation
of his life to a better
place. But to proceed, <hi>Rodolphus</hi>
had not been happy in the great
enjoyment of this good ſociety
above a year or two, but the
youthful exorbitances of himſelf,
and two or three more among
them, invited them to ſuch extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancies,
that had not the ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
perſwaſions of ſome of their
Relations interpoſed, they had
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65986:5"/>
been made uncapable of conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
themſelves as members of
that Society, by the juſt reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of their incenſed Maſter;
for the daily complaints of the
Country people, ſome lamenting
the loſs of their Geeſe, others of
their Turkeys and Hens, ſome of
their fat Pigs, but moſt, of their
Orchards being robb'd, did ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex
that good old Gentleman,
that when he perceived private
chaſtiſements (which they ſeldom
wanted) would not prevail, he
took a courſe leſs painful, but far
more diſgraceful to them; for in
his very Sermons he would take
the opportunities of publick
checks; nay, their crimes (and
partly his age) would ſo highly
provoke him, that he would of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
particularize their names in
the open Congregation; which
was ſo inſufferable, that two or
three among them, moſt guilty,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65986:6"/>
could not endure to be thus gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
but in revenge muſt needs be
gone, every one to their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
friends, with proteſtations ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to return, pretending ſome
great injury received: They had
no ſooner taken this reſolution,
but they as ſoon put it in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and without giving the leaſt
notice either to Maſter or School-fellows,
they ſtole away to their
ſeveral homes; and every one
found alike entertainment, for as
if their Relations had foreknown
of their arrivals, and within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
concluded of their recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
though they lived many
miles aſunder; yet thus went the
humour, that no ſooner came
they home, but as ſoon were they
ſent back again, with their Parents
ſervants with them, and Letters to
the old Fox, who ſmilingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulated
their return; but the
next morning he taught them the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65986:6"/>
difference between words and
blows, &amp; made every one of them
know, that ſtolen Geeſe muſt have
whipping Sauce: thus are they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
and reinſtated in ſo good a
condition, that others more wiſe
would think it a happineſs not to
be parallel'd; but the School and
the Rod were alwaies enemies to
liberty and eaſe, and ſo thought
they; yet neceſſity has no Law,
for to their ſtudies they muſt, and
indeed they might acknowledge
a thanks, rather than diſcontent,
for ſuch ſuppoſed ſeverities: for
ſhould not youth be bridled from
thoſe unſatiable and boundleſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies
they are uſually guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of, they might <hi>(Phaëton</hi>-like)
with their unadviſed ambitions,
hurl themſelves, and perhaps their
relations, into many inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
ſooner to be ſorrowed than
quitted. Hiſtory and experience
daily tells us of many woful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65986:7"/>
that giddy-headed young
men run themſelves into: had <hi>Ica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
been adviſed by the diſcreet
foreſight of his wiſe Father <hi>Dedalus,</hi>
(who too truly feared the ſucceſs
of his ingenious Arts) perhaps to
to this day we might have wanted
a name for the <hi>Icarian</hi> Seas, or at
leaſt have found one leſs ominous:
but what need I dilate on that
which a whole Cart-load of Books
are full of, my intent is otherwiſe;
therefore <hi>ad rem.</hi> By the ſtay'd
and aweful authority of <hi>Rodolphus</hi>
reſpected Tutor, he kept within
bounds for two or three years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this firſt laſhing out, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
was never guilty of any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
non-compliance (unleſs
his ſelling ſome Books now and
then, and loſing his cloaths at
gaming, or the like) till from that
Nurſery he found a removal into
a more ſpacious Plantation, where
he had a larger liberty to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65986:7"/>
his youthful inclinations than
was heretofore allowed him; for
no ſooner was he thought fit (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
more by favour than learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
for <hi>Oxford,</hi> but immediately
with all poſſible care had he a
Chamber, Tutor, and Servitour
provided for him in that ancient
and famous Colledge of <hi>Chriſt-Church;</hi>
where he had not long
continued, till he quickly found
the want of that true and Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox
Principle he was all along
brought up in: A fine moderate
methodical way of teaching was
uſed by his Reverend Maſter, with
ſuch a ſtaid gravity and piety, that
his influence was very great upon
the moſt ſtubborn Lad among
them; but now the caſe is altered,
<hi>Quot capita tot ſententiae,</hi> and as
<hi>Ovid</hi> ſaith in relation to the firſt
Chaos, 'twas a <hi>rudis indigeſtaque
moles,</hi> and ſo certainly did it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
here; for every body would
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65986:8"/>
be ſomething, and yet no body
was any thing, eſpecially his little
Tutor, who like a ſecond <hi>Protaeus</hi>
could ingeniouſly diſguiſe himſelf
into the moſt ſafe ſhape; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
one of <hi>Goodwins</hi> Diſciples,
then a Preſbyterian Zealiſt; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
a <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Nay</hi> muſt be the
burden of the Song; then were
they all Hobby-horſes without a
ſecond Dip: thus ran he his divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
now a leſſon in Philoſophy,
then in Divinity; ſometimes in
Metaphyſicks, then in Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks;
ſure I am he had as many
tricks as a dancing Bear, but they
had quickly trick for trick with
him: for whileſt he was beating
his addle brains about new inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations,
they were ſtill inventing
new recreations; ſo that Billiards,
Tennice, Bowls, Cards, Dice, each
were as wel acquainted with them
as all Phantaſtick Principles with
him. Time runs apace, which
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65986:8"/>
makes <hi>Rodolphus</hi> quickly paſs the
months of a Freſhman, and ſoon
underſtand that more honour
lay under a ragged Gown than
a new one; he quickly learned
how to take things upon faith,
and for half the worth to ſell them
for ready money; he thought it
a very good ſhift, for I am ſure
among their rattle-headed pates,
they rattled all away from poor
young Gentlemen, who had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to help them but their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
and a very little of that too;
for <hi>Rodolphus</hi> could never learn
the art of turning his eyes topſy
turvy, nor their long yaunings,
nor falſe ſpittings, with their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited
ſmiles nor Crocodile
tears; he could never do any thing
of it, therefore muſt ſuffer for it:
however in the midſt of theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities
he had comfort in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſome Companions in his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries;
for doubtleſs they had a
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65986:9"/>
knot that could be as merry as
they, and perhaps as drunk too,
but not altogether ſoe private:
they had not got the right way of
the Preſbyterian drinking, and I
hope never will. Thus after this
mazed rate rubb'd he out, till the
deſires of ſome of his Relations
incited him to manly improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which quickly took ſo
good effect, that he ſoon became
a good Proficient in the art of
Fencing; which ſurly exerciſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animated
him ſo much, that he
began to think himſelf a man;
and indeed his age being then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
15 and 16 inabled him to
execute that which gained him
ſome applauſe with his Military
Maſter, and likewiſe ſo good a
ſort of acquaintance, that after a
little time they dared ſo much
confide in one another, that no
ſecret or deſign whatever, but
what was common among them.

There were three beſides <hi>Rodol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus,</hi>
who were fully reſolved to
hazzard their fortunes in a year or
two's Travel, and notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
two of them were elder Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and now men of great E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates;
yet their Credits were then
ſo indifferent, that for the furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of this deſign they were not
able to raiſe above thirty pounds,
and that too by ſelling their
Books, Bedding, and other Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture
of their Chambers. <hi>Rodol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phu</hi>'s
own ſtock was but ſmall, yet
for the proſecution of ſuch He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick
Intentions, his endeavours
were very earneſt; for what with
his Bedding, Books, and Gown,
and likewiſe his Credit, he made
a ſhift to raiſe above twenty
pounds: ſo that among them they
had at leaſt fifty pounds. This
great ſum, with the fear of a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
made them almoſt mad;
but to be quickly free from thoſe
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65986:10"/>
doubts, they hired each of them
a Hackney Horſe, (but never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
the owners ſhould ſee
them again till their return:) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus accoutred, and every
thing ſecure, I know not what
unhappy Planet diſcovered it, or
what <hi>Argus</hi>'s eyes diſcern'd it;
but certain I am, they were all
diſcovered, and this hopeful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
nipt in the very bud, and I
fear me by the too too great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry
of one of <hi>Rodolphus</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
who having no inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Authority in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and
having had ſome hint in the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
(would the tongue were out
that told it) immediately took
half a dozen of the Officers of the
Town with him, and made a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
ſearch, but could hear no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of them till eleven or twelve
a clock at night, when they were
all Booted and Spur'd, juſt going
to take Horſe, the Officers met
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:65986:10"/>
our young Scholars full butt in the
Streets, who immediately bid
them ſtand, and they as immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
bid them follow them, for
they all took heels and run for't,
their Conſciences frighting them
more then their Followers; but
Boots and Spurs, and other lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
about them, prevented their
deſires, and ſlackned that expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which they highly wanted in
ſuch a caſe; ſo that they became
preys to their enemies, but on ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
honourable terms; for when
our young Scholars ſaw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in the net, they were reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to run out of it, or break it,
which made them draw, with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
far exceeding their years,
or cauſe, and commanded their
purſuers at their perils to ſtand,
which was obeyed, and a parley
propoſed; which being accepted,
they made their conditions ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their deſires, only were
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65986:11"/>
forc'd to lay down their Weapons
&amp; retake themſelves again to their
Gowns, but with a ſolemn engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that their Parents ſhould
not be acquainted with this extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancy,
but ſhould return <hi>Statu
quo prius.</hi> This being granted,
they returned their monies to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem
their Beds, and ſatisfie other
Creditors, which grieved them
moſt of all; for certainly ſo great
a ſum of Money was never ſeen
among them: but according to
promiſe all was huſht, and no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
taken of this frolick for a
great while; but at laſt ſome ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
tongues began to whiſper
ſo loud, that all the Town rang of
it, ſo that Prayers and thanks were
offered up by many of their poor
Creditors for this fair deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
and the owners of the Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
could not be backward in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
their eſcape. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this were politickly divulged
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:65986:11"/>
by any of their Relations, that
others ſhould not truſt them any
more, I will not now queſtion;
but this I am ſure of, that their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dits
were grown ſo ſmall upon it,
that they could keep open Shop no
longer, but were forc'd to part,
ſome one way and ſome another,
till a more favourable day might
bring them together again; which
came to paſs according to their
wiſhes, as in the proceſs of this
diſcourſe you ſhall underſtand.
In the midſt of theſe tranſactions,
and ſome other little frolicks
which are too inconſiderable to
particularize, the Saint-like Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
of our young <hi>Rodolphus</hi> began
to be troubleſome, and thunder
out his furious threats, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted
to little leſs then excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications;
for he ſolemnly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted
the very next extravagancy
committed by our late criminal
ſhould be puniſhed by no leſs a
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65986:12"/>
chaſtiſement then an expelling;
notwithſtanding all this <hi>Rodolphus</hi>
was not yet ſatisfied, nor dreaded
theſe ſevere pronunciations ſo
much, but that he muſt have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
fling; and a little while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a convenient opportunity pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
it ſelf; for the great fame
of the Funeral ſolemnization of
the late Uſurper began to grow ſo
eminent, that he was no Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
that would not ſee ſuch a Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony:
Our young Gallant was
ſpurr'd on to this enterprize with
earneſtneſs, for he never ſaw the
famous City of <hi>London</hi> till then;
his deſires therefore not to be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
but by an accompliſhment,
made him the more diligent in the
proſecution thereof: but what
inconveniences and ſhifts muſt
he ſtill run into that has nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Money nor Credit to aſſiſt his
deſigns? This certainly would
diſcourage any but our Author,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:65986:12"/>
who was reſolved by hook or by
crook for <hi>London:</hi> There were in
the Colledge two or three of his
aſſociates well principled young
men, who had the ſame deſires;
but that which was moſt to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented,
the ſame purſes and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dits
likewiſe as himſelf; but <hi>Labor
omnia vincit improbus,</hi> for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
induſtry of our young
Gentlemen amounted to ſo good
an effect, that againſt the time
<hi>Rodolphus</hi> had gotten not only
two good Hackney-Horſes for
himſelf and Servitor, but likewiſe
a very rich embroiodred Coat,
with Boots, Sword, and Belt, which
the credulity of one of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Servants entruſted him with;
his Companions were likewiſe
ſucceſsful in every thing but Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
for there was not twenty
ſhillings among four of them and
their Servants, at their leaving of
<hi>Oxford;</hi> but gone they are,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65986:13"/>
Friends nor Tutors know not whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
they fear'd their flight to
be beyond the Seas, and too late
ſhut the Stable door; but they
were all miſtaken, for <hi>London</hi> was
the fartheſt place for their deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Travels. They were forc'd to
lie one night upon the Road,
which made ſuch a deep impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
into their little ſtock, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
their Reckoning paid, they
had but two ſhillings left to carry
them to <hi>London,</hi> &amp; in what part to
go to in that huge place they could
not imagine; for to be near the
<hi>Temple</hi> they dar'd not, ſome of
their Relations being there reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;
to be near the Court they
likewiſe were afraid, having ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
of their Kindred intereſſed
too too much in that rebellious
Compliance. This conſideration
put our young Travellers into a
great <hi>non-plus;</hi> but after a ſerious
conſultation it was propoſed by
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:65986:13"/>
one of them, that <hi>Tuttle-ſtreet</hi> would
be moſt convenient to receive
them, by reaſon that his Taylor
dwelt there, who would be very
neceſſary among them, being all
ſtrangers in <hi>London:</hi> This propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
was generally lik'd of, which
made them ſteer their courſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
thither, where in few hours
after they ſafely arrived, and at
the two neck't Swan took up their
quarters, but could hear no news
of the Taylor: they had no Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
left, but ſpared not calling
plentifully, their Horſes being
good pledges for an honeſt pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Well you ſee we have
brought theſe young Scholars to
<hi>London,</hi> where for a while we will
leave them, and look back a little
from whence they came, and how
all things go there: Our young
Gentlemens Tutors quickly found
that the Birds were flown, and as
quickly gave the Alarm to <hi>Rodol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus's</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:65986:14"/>
Relations, who lived not far
from <hi>Oxford;</hi> they all proclaimed
him the ring-leader of theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances,
and made him the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
criminal, when indeed they
were all equals: they were ſo ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
at the ſuddenneſs of their
flight, that had not the Credit of
<hi>Rodolphus</hi> his Relations prevented
it, they had ſent Hues and Cryes
after them and their Horſes; but
they look'd before they leapt, and
wiſely conſidered that a better
plaiſter could not be applied to
this wound, then a diſcreet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment;
which being agreed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them, they patiently wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the event, and daily put up their
Orizons for a ſpeedy return of
their ſuppoſed loſt Pupils: but
whilſt the careful Tutors live in
ſuſpence at <hi>Oxford,</hi> their jolly Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pils
merrily divert themſelves at
<hi>London;</hi> but their guilty fears of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
cauſed their jealous diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65986:14"/>
and put them into many
dangerous frights; amongſt the
reſt this is worthy the taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of: One day they muſt needs
walk down to the Water-ſide,
and being come neer the <hi>Thames</hi>
in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>-Yard, the Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
(as they thought) came
ſtrangely up towards them, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Sculler or Oars, Sculler or
Oars?</hi> which confuſed noiſe our
young Gentlemen not being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with, verily believed
them to be men ſet there on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to apprehend them, and
really thought they had cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Scholars and Rogues, Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
and Rogues!</hi> which made
them all return, but faſter than
they came thither, never look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
back till they had got
to their quarters, and verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
their eſcape proceeded
from the ſwiftneſs of their flight:
they no ſooner came in but imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65986:15"/>
they conſulted their ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities;
and after a long and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
debate, 'twas reſolved among
them, that their beſt way would
be to avoid this verily believed
ſearch by changing their Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
they could not effect their
deſires by reaſon of a Reckoning
not ſatisfied in their Inn, which
put them almoſt to their wits end,
and made <hi>Rodolphus</hi> try once
more how to get their necks out
of this confinement: he had a Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
lived at <hi>Hammerſmith,</hi> which
put him in hopes that if he ſhould
go to ſee her, his credit, or her
love would contribute to a ſupply
ſuitable to their deliverance; he
went accordingly and found her
at home, but withal he likewiſe
found at her houſe his Brother
and other Relations, which for
the reaſon aforeſaid, being clad
and furniſh'd with his Brothers
finery, he had as leave ſeen old
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:65986:15"/>
Nick as his face at that preſent: he
no ſooner underſtood of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
being there, but as ſoon he
made his eſcape, and returned as
empty as he went thither of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
though fuller of fear; his
neceſſities notwithſtanding daily
encreaſing, and his credit decrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
at his Quarters, he was infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to ſend his Servitor within
two or three days after, with a
Letter to his Siſter, full of ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs
for the lending of money;
when he came to her ſhe made
him alight (though contrary to
the commands his Maſter gave
him) and after ſhe had got him
into her houſe, ſhe brought him
to the Brother then ſo much fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by our young <hi>Rodolphus,</hi> who
immediately took this puiſne Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitor
to task, and after ſome great
words made him confeſs where his
Maſter lay; this being under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
th<gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> immediately cauſed
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:65986:16"/>
his Coach to be made ready, and
with himſelf, Wife, and two or
three of <hi>Rodolphus</hi>'s Siſters, put
themſelves abord this Leather
Bark, and by the aſſiſtance of the
ſilly Guideſman, ſteared their
courſe directly to his Maſters Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
and arrived within a very
little time there, at the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
when <hi>Rodolphus</hi> was ſelling
one of his hired Horſes; but their
coming changed the Scene, and as
Fortune would have it, much for
the better; for the great compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance
of <hi>Rodolphus</hi>'s Brother plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
teſtified his contentment rather
than reſentments of his youthful
frolicks. And after ſome little
repaſt given by <hi>Rodolphus</hi> to theſe
new come Gueſts, he calls for a
Bill or Reckoning, which his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
liberally paid, and redeemed
theſe young Pawns from their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrifty
engagements; and gave
order, that (the next da<gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> being the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:65986:16"/>
great ſhow of the ambitious for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality
of <hi>Olivers</hi> Funeral) <hi>Rodol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pbus</hi>
ſhould wait on his Siſter-in-Law,
to ſee what he ſo far came
for; which he did accordingly,
and had a conveniency far exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his expectations, and among
perſons of ſo good a repute, and
ſuch brave young Ladies, that our
young Gentleman quite forgot his
late extremities, and by this ſudden
alteration did begin to believe
that he was born to live a Courtier;
but the very next day by the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of his grave and careful Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who was then at the <hi>Temple,</hi>
and had heard of his Sons laſhing
out, he ſent one of his men with
a command to ſee him ſafe home
at his Colledge again, otherwiſe
he ſhould certainly incur his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
diſpleaſure: theſe ſummons
at firſt ſurprized <hi>Rodolphus,</hi> being
juſt warm in the enjoyment of
gallant company, and brave en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments;
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:65986:17"/>
but the ſenſibility of
his late crimes made him wiſely
conſider, that it would not be ſafe
to incenſe an already provoked
Father too much; but ſince he
he had ſo fair an opportunity, and
on ſuch good terms to return, he
preſently obeyed, and gave a fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel
(though unwillingly) to his
late acquaintance; and with
his Servitor, and Fathers Man
took Horſe that very afternoon,
having leſt his Fellow-Scholars
two or three dayes before, and
tends his courſe for <hi>Oxford,</hi> where
the next day he arrived, without
any conſiderable adventure on the
Road; and coming to his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
he accidentally met with his
Tutor in the Quadrangle, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſome complements paſſed, this
little puppet muſt needs begin to
charm his harſh Pipe, and take the
liberty to check his Pupil for his
late extravagancy; but the <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:65986:17"/>
Air had ſo much altered our
young Gentleman, that no ſuch
<hi>Oxford</hi> breath was pleaſing to him,
which made him roughly quit his
Tutors Company, and tell him,
that if he found no better wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
from others then from him,
he would return from whence he
came, where (as he ſaid) he ſhould
be free from ſuch taunts. This is
the ſecond time of <hi>Rodolphus</hi>'s re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetlement
in his Colledge-life, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
two conſiderable flyings out,
and had not the muſical tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the warlike Inſtruments
invited him abroad, perhaps at
this day we might have found him
in <hi>Chriſt-Church;</hi> but what cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
can be expected from Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and young Men, the one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting
the Winde, the other
the Weather, for their uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy?
One day <hi>Rodolphus</hi> with
two or three of his accuſtomed
companions, being drinking a glaſs
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:65986:18"/>
of Wine together at the Mermaid-Tavern
in <hi>Oxford,</hi> accidentally
ſaw marching up the high Street, a
gallant Party of Horſe, bravely
accoutred, and well mounted, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
with their Officers at the
head of them, and their naked
Swords in their hands in ſo noble a
poſture, that it hugely delighted
our young Gentlemen, but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<hi>Rodolphus;</hi> who being raviſht
with a martial reſolution, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
began to incite and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
the mindes of his Aſſociates,
with a deſire of compleating that
gallant company with their own
perſons and endeavours; he need
not ſtrike fire twice, the tinder re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
the firſt ſpark without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial;
for no ſooner had they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd
a conveniency, but as ſoon
they executed it, and without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
delay immediately pawned
their Gowns in the Tavern, and
merrily drank the Health of their
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:65986:18"/>
new Admirers, as far as the worth
of their Gowns would permit
them; and afterwards ſolemnly
proteſted, that in exchange of
ſuch a Monkiſh Habit, they would
put on the Buff-Coat, with the
iron Hat and Doublet, and never
wear Gown more in <hi>Oxford.</hi> This
reſolution, by moſt of them was
quickly put in execution, but par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
by our <hi>Rodolphus,</hi> who
by the intereſt of ſome acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
in thoſe Troops (when per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions
of Friends could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
it) got himſelf muſtred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them; and his delight in
that military employment gave
him no cauſe to repent of his
change of life; for favour liberti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
him ſo much, that he was ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
ſenſible of any hardſhip or
Duty; but riding about and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing
among them when he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
was grown a cuſtom to him,
till one of his Relations (a Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:65986:19"/>
of that Army) reſolving to
make him a Souldier, began to
have a ſtrict eye over him, and
kept him at laſt ſo cloſe to his Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that as often as it came to his
turn, he was forc'd to watch with
his Comrades; which then made
him perceive the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
a hard Board-Bed at <hi>Pauls,</hi>
and a ſoft Feather-Bed at <hi>Chriſt-Church.</hi>
Notwithſtanding this
rough uſage, our young Souldier's
reſolutions were too great to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of the leaſt diſcouragements
in his Martial Proceedings; for
ſo much was his delight in this new
kinde of life, that he neglected
not only fair opportunities of
more conſiderable advantages
then he at that time enjoyed, but
likewiſe by no perſwaſions what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
could he be invited from that
rambling and looſe kinde of life,
to a noble and gentile education at
the <hi>Temple,</hi> which his Friends
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:65986:19"/>
would then moſt willingly have
beſtowed on him. This intended
perſeverance continued not ſo
long, but perhaps the too too ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
checks and Commands of a
Brother, which was then his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel,
urgeth a <hi>Vale</hi> from ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franchiſements
by our young
Souldier: A diſobedience to his
Superior Officer he well knew was
not to be tollerated, nor proper
for a Souldier to be guilty of;
but a neglect of a Brothers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
he thought pardonable, or
at leaſt would make it ſo; there
being ever a natural antipathy, in
ſuch caſes; for equals in birth and
nature could never yet ſubject
themſelves to a willing compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of each others humours: this
being then the caſe of <hi>Rodolphus,</hi>
he fully determined to venture his
fortunes in one year or two's Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel,
rather then ſubmit himſelf to
a Brothers Commands, having at
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:65986:20"/>
that time a moſt convenient en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to execute his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
deſigns; for two of
of thoſe young Scholars which, as
you have heretofore heard, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with him at <hi>Chriſt-Church,</hi> came
and found out their old Aſſociate,
which they ſo long wanted, and
after a mutual congratulation gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and received among them,
they ſoon reſolved what was to
be done, and being pretty well
provided for their Voyage, they
all parted from <hi>Tanton-Dean</hi>
(where <hi>Rodolphus</hi> then quartered)
and with what privacy poſſible
got to <hi>Plymouth,</hi> where they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to take ſhipping: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there ſafely arrived, their
firſt buſineſs was to enquire what
Veſſels were bound outward, and
whither; which being asked, 'twas
known that two were then ready
for <hi>France,</hi> and ſtayed for nothing
but the advantage of a fair wind:
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:65986:20"/>
which news was not a little wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
to theſe young Gentlemen,
<hi>France</hi> being the ſtage coveted by
them all to act their firſt parts in.
They quartered at the <hi>Three
Cranes,</hi> where they began to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
that a perſon of more than
ordinary quality lay there wind-bound,
and afterwards under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
his imbarking to be in the
ſame Veſſel which they intended
to venture in: this perſon of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
took great delight in our
young Travellers, and gave them
ſuch large and generous proffers
of his civilities, that this unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
good fortune hugely ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
<hi>Rodolphus</hi> and his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
who began to think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
the happieſt young men
living; they wanted nothing but
a wind to waft them over that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
Element, nor deſired no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more; they lived gentilely
where they lodged, and made but
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:65986:21"/>
few meals, which was not in the
company of the ſuppoſed Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:
but who muſt I complain
of; or what Deſtiny directs things
ſo ſeverely, that our poor <hi>Rodol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi>
can never rightly accompliſh
his generous inclinations? we ſee
him here ſafe at <hi>Plymouth,</hi> and in a
company which his very ſoul de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
in; yet we muſt ſound a
a retreat, and reſign a contented
enjoyment for an uncertain diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment:
but we hourly ſee
the faireſt day has ſome ſhowers,
and the moſt ſerene ſkie in the
morning, often clouded with dark
vapours by noon; thus we find
<hi>Rodolphus</hi> his unparallel'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
ſoon eclipſed by the
too curious ſearch of his brothers
Soldiers, who no ſooner found
him wanting, but he ſent a Party
after him with a full Commiſſion
to bring him back again: this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
of his brothers was diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:65986:21"/>
to <hi>Rodolphus</hi> by one of his Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
before 'twas altogether put
in execution, which inforced him
to ſell his Horſe, which he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to tranſport, but worſt of all,
to leave that dear company he
ſo entirely loved; and that very
night the Soldiers came into <hi>Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi>
in ſearch of him, he private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
took Poſt-Horſes, and by the
next morning got to <hi>Exeter,</hi> where
he met with very kind Letters
from his brother, with notice that
he had got him a Commiſſion for
Cornet of Horſe: this news at
firſt ſtartled <hi>Rodolphus,</hi> but at laſt
he conſidered that this might be
only a trap to enſnare him in, and
a decoy to invite him to his own
Net, which made him take no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of theſe Letters, but made
what haſte he could to <hi>Englands</hi>
Metropolis, where he aſſured him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
of a privacy ſutable to his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated
ſecurity; he took freſh
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:65986:22"/>
Poſt-Horſes at <hi>Exon,</hi> and rid
with all Expedition till he came
to <hi>Salisbury;</hi> but there he met
with ſo infallible aſſurances of
his brothers reality, and likewiſe
ſome ſeaſonable advice and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions
to return and comply
with his brothers humours, that
from <hi>Salisbury</hi> he went directly to
his brothers, who lay but eight
miles from thence, and found a
very civil reception from him,
with a Cornets Commiſſion in
his brothers Pocket, according as
his Letters ſignified: but theſe
fair Propoſals could not invite
our <hi>Rodolphus</hi> to put his neck a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
under the diſaffected yoke of
his brothers Priviledges, which as
his ſuperior Officer, he had over
him; but inſtead of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
he deſired to ride in Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<hi>Monks</hi> Life-Guard (who was
then lately come out of <hi>Scotland:)</hi>
his brother ſeeing him thus averſe
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:65986:22"/>
in a ſecond re-engagement, and
perceiving his neglect of ſuch fair
proffers, gave way to his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations,
and with Letters of
recommendation to Sir <hi>Philip
Howard</hi> ſent him going, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
glad of ſuch an Errand, with
Horſe and Arms, and other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations
ſutable for ſuch
employments, he gets to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
where he ſoon found out Sir
<hi>Philip,</hi> and received the ſatisfaction
of a very civil reception from that
ever Honourable perſon, with a
promiſe of an admittance into the
Guard the very next Muſter; which
afterwards was accordingly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
with a civility and reſpect
far exceeding his expectations:
but <hi>Rodolphus</hi> being yet very
young, not exceeding 18. or 19.
at moſt, began to laſh out there
more then ever; for he ſoon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
that his years had not yet
made him capable of ſuch experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:65986:23"/>
Companions as Life-Guard
Men; his money whilſt it
laſted fled merrily about, and in
leſ<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> then a twelve-month his Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
head was ſwoln ſo big, that he
could not get him out of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
door; a diſeaſe very incident
and almoſt infectious among thoſe
Gentlemens Horſes. This acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
hapning in a very bad time,
made <hi>Rodolphus</hi> almoſt mad, and
put him to his wits end for new
ſhifts how to rub out; which he
endeavoured ſo long, that he rub'd
every thing bare he had to do
withal, and at laſt rub'd himſelf
out of the Guard: <hi>Rub, rub, and a
good caſt,</hi> the Proverb goes; I
am ſure here were rubs enough,
and yet the caſt bad. This one
years extravagancy did not only
coſt his Relations ſeveral ſums of
Money, beſides his pay, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
contracted debts, not inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
to him: notwithſtanding
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:65986:23"/>
which, upon a ſerious promiſe of
reformation, our <hi>Rodolphus</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
received into his Fathers af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
who paid all his debts, and
plac'd him in the <hi>Temple,</hi> with ſo
great a care and conveniency, that
he liv'd amongſt, and convers'd
with the beſt of that Honourable
Society: but having not yet ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his wilde Oats, and finding the
Law-French, very crabid in
compariſon of the ſmooth ſtile of
<hi>Pembrokes Arcadia,</hi> or a <hi>Scuda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mores
Caſſandra,</hi> he was not able
to endure ſuch harſh Lectures, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairing
of ever attaining to that
knowledge of the Law, which
ſome of his Predeceſſors has been
very eminent in; which conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
made him once more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
to ſee ſome other then the
Engliſh world; which his Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
perceiving, and ſeeing that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
would tame this unbridled
youth but champing on the bit,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:65986:24"/>
they freely gave way to his deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
Travels; but withal cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly
contrived his tranſporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to a place far different to
his expectations, and in a condition
befitting the worſt of Criminals;
for inſtead of a plauſible voyage
to ſee the world, and benefit
an accompliſhment by it, he was
fairly ſhipt for <hi>Virginia,</hi> and as
fairly ſold as any Slave that ever
went thither. Now <hi>Rodolphus</hi> has
brought his Hogs to a fair Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,
and has ſolitary Woods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
in that unfrequented place,
to moan his unexpected and into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
miſery: I verily believe the
worſt of his lives in <hi>England</hi> would
then have been as welcome to
him, as liberty is to thoſe whoſe
ſtrict confinement forbids their
ſeeing the Sun for ſome years; but
'tis too late to repent, too late to
wiſh, or almoſt hope, he ſees him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
bought and ſold like a Nag in
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:65986:24"/>
               <hi>Smithfield,</hi> and he that gave moſt
for him had him: Is this the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
<hi>Rodolphus</hi> of all thy enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes,
and are thy generous under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings
but a breeding qualm of
this prodigious birth? is this the
prize of thy alwayes large endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours?
ſurely, ſurely, thy deſigns
were never ſo mechanick to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe
ſuch mean ſucceſſes; but
thou art not the firſt thus horribly
plunged, for at this day the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh
Gallies afford too many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents
of like, or worſe effects to
noble and generous ſouls. Had
our <hi>Rodolphus</hi> enjoyed but a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion
in theſe extremities, I have
often heard him ſay, that his bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
would then have been but
light; for his charity was then ſo
little, that he did not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moan
his Aſſociates felicities in
their French Travels, but with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality
wiſht them at his dirty em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments:
The Mattock and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:65986:25"/>
the Axe muſt be the only compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
for <hi>Rodolphus</hi> diverſions, which
at firſt ſeemed moſt ſevere, the
beginning of enterprizes being
uſually more hard then the effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them; but <hi>uſe makes perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi>
ſo that our young <hi>Virginian</hi>
paſſeth his ſlavery with a better
performance, and far better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
then at his firſt arrival; he
daily improves himſelf in thoſe
ſtrange exerciſes, and quickly
learnt to be ſo good a Cooper,
that he may never deſpair of an
ordinary livelihood from his late
gotten ſkill: His uſual exerciſe
was felling down Trees, hooping
of Hogſheads; and his taſk would
be often ſo ſevere, that grim de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair
would ſometimes preſent
himſelf in thoſe Woods, which are
fitting for nothing more then ſuch
helliſh Executioners; but provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
protected him with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and at laſt gave him an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of a fair deliverance:
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:65986:25"/>
for by the ſudden fancy and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of a generous ſoul (for whoſe
ſake <hi>Rodolphus</hi> continues a Vaſſal
to her Sex) he found his liberty
from his tyrannizing Maſter, and
a fair priviledge for his ſafe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn:
he meets with this Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Woman by accident, who
came into a Barn where he was
working, and being very inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive
about ſeveral particulars,
ſhe immediately grew ſo concern'd
for him, that ſhe told him he was
his own man; for ſhe had already
bought him as her own Slave,
therefore he was at her diſpoſe,
and might go or come when and
where he pleaſed: This unheard
of generoſity ſurprized our young
Captive ſo much, that had he
found the leaſt correſpondency
either in Birth, Parts, or perſon
with himſelf, or indeed had he
found either Youth or Beauty in
her, I am perſwaded his ſoul was
then ſo full of gratitude, that he
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:65986:26"/>
would have thought of no other
requital then himſelf to give her;
but where all ſuch invitations are
wanting, and only the relicks of
a rough Planter to be courted, he
thought the return of her immenſe
kindneſſes could not be better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
then by preſent
thanks, and future profit, as he
plentifully promiſed; for indeed
had there been all that belongs to
the accompliſhment of a woman
in this Virginian Widow, his
youthful Inclinations were already
prepoſſeſt, and the intire affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which he then owed to a
young Lady in <hi>England,</hi> made him
altogether incapable of a ſecond
paſſion: ſeeing therefore he could
not poſſibly ſatisfie the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Benefactreſs (who cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
had more then an ordinary
reſpect for him) he began wiſely
to conſider the promiſing danger
he was liable unto in a long ſtay
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:65986:26"/>
there; for as women are the beſt
things living, if pleaſed, ſo once
being incenſed, are they the worſt
things breathing. Hiſtory is ſo
full of diabolical deſigns, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutions
of theſe ſort of Furies,
that he fully reſolved to ſhun the
event, and not allow opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
a conveniency to make him
the ſubject of ſuch tranſactions:
but ſince fortune had been ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
to open the Priſon Door,
and unlock'd his Fetters, he
thought it high time to rouze him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and not to abuſe that uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Deities civility, fearing her
frowns, as well as rejoicing at her
ſmiles: he therefore with all pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacy
and expedition prepares for
a farewel from thoſe wild Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,
who had ſo often made his
heart to bleed by their Turkiſh
uſages; and after ſome little time
ſpent in the obſervance of that
pleaſantly made Country, he left
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:65986:27"/>
thoſe parts with as much joy, as
with grief he came to them. I
have often heard him ſpeak with
ſo great a delight, and ſo much
favour of the Country it ſelf;
that the pleaſantneſs thereof was
the only cauſe of his patient ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings;
for in the midſt of his
ſlavery he would divert himſelf
with the ſeveral objects of wild
beaſts, and the natural order of
a pleaſant Wilderneſs; he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
it to be ſcituated in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
Clime, and a commonly
ſerene ſkie; he found the whole
Country a Grove full of Oaks,
Pines, Cedars, Cypreſs, Lawrel,
Saſſafras, Mulberries, Plum-trees,
Peaches, and Vines, all of ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable
an aſpect, that the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholieſt
eye in the world could
not look upon it without content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
nor content himſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
admiration: there are no
ſhrubs or underwoods to choak up
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:65986:27"/>
the paſſage; and in its ſeaſon your
foot can hardly direct it ſelf,
where it will not be died in the
blood of large and delicious
Strawberries; the plenty of Fiſh,
Fowl, and Beaſts, fitting for the
ſuſtenance of man, are innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
And indeed there is nothing
wanting in this fruitful and plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Country, that can be deſired
for the ſatisfaction of the moſt vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous
wiſhes. But 'tis time
to follow our <hi>Rodolphus,</hi> who is
now tumbling over mountains of
Seas, and in ſo rough a ſeaſon, that
the memory of man never afforded
ſuch a ſtormy paſſage; 'twas the
great Hurricane, that blew ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Trees from their mother Earth,
which by providence brought
home our young Traveller, though
hundred others ſteept their bodies
in <hi>Neptunes</hi> brine; no Sun appeared
in many weeks to direct the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's
obſervation; nothing but
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:65986:28"/>
ſhowers and bluſtring ſtorms; the
<hi>Porpoiſes</hi> ſkipping and ſwarming
about the Ships, plainly told them
of their preſent dangers; and the
hourly ſpectacles of moſt ſad and
lamentable Shipwracks portend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their own deſtructions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
an Almighty Providence: in
this horrible condition ſailed they
through the turbulent Element,
and at laſt upon the Engliſh Coaſt,
in <hi>Briſtol</hi> Channel they were caſt
away, and amongſt 36 Paſſengers
and Seamen, five only eſcaped this
furious violence, among which
<hi>Rodolphus</hi> was one, who could
not ſwim, nor aſſiſt himſelf in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing more than deſiring the
help of the Almighty Aſſiſtor, who
miraculouſly preſerved his life,
and pulled him out of <hi>Neptunes</hi>
jaws, whileſt others were ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
up by that greedy Devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer:
but after a tedious and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible
tumbling in the Seas, their
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:65986:28"/>
cruelty at laſt ceaſed, being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed
with the Victim of 30 of
them at leaſt; the reſt being caſt
on the neighbouring Rocks,
where they made a ſhift to ſcram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
from that unkind entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
they lately received; and
after the warm Sun and fixt foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
had a little comforted
them, they began to revive like
thoſe which newly came forth of
a deadly Trance; and when their
frozen tongues began to melt,
they firſt expreſt their joy for the
great mercy of this admirable
deliverance, and with the ſame
tongues lamented the loſs of all
their poor acquaintances, with ſo
great a ſorrow, that the very
Rocks they then ſate on ſeemed
to accompany their complaints;
they ſaw the Bodies, Goods, and
Veſſel of their loving friends toſt
on the Seas, with ſo angry a moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as if they reſolved to revenge
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:65986:29"/>
poor <hi>Rodolphus</hi>'s eſcape on thoſe
already inanimates; they were
not able to endure this pitiful
ſpectacle, but with what haſt their
feeble limbs would permit, they
got away, hunger and cold forcing
a march; the beſt furniſht among
them was ſo poorly clad, that <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolphus</hi>
was beſt provided, having
only a Shirt, Waſtcoat, and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings;
but his charity would not
permit him to wear them, for the
Captain of the Veſſel, who was
likewiſe ſaved from this miſerable
ſhipwrack, had not ſo much as a
Shirt to his back, which forced
<hi>Rodolphus</hi> to lend him his, leaving
himſelf only Linings and Waſtcoat.
In this poor habit march they
along, being neer twenty miles
from <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and being forced to
live on the charitable contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the better ſort of Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders
till they got thither, <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolphus</hi>
was the Speaker where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:65986:29"/>
they came, and plaid the part
of a Beggar ſo well, that had
they been for a conſiderable time
to endure this kind of life, they
perceived this begging Oratory
would keep them from a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
belly, or at leaſt a ſtarving; but
they were not the right ſort of
Ramblers, who deſtine their lives
to ſuch theeviſh and lazy exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;
for their bare feet, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
bare backs, gave them ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
bitter remembrances, and
ſharply adviſed their ſpeedy deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
out of thoſe neceſſities:
they often found taunts and
threts, as well as compaſſion and
relief; which made them of an
opinion, that none has thoſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
in the diſcovery of mens
affections and conditions, as theſe
State Caterpillers: They went
ſtill to the better ſort of Houſes,
and if any of them proved to be
Gentlemen, they could give ſo
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:65986:30"/>
civil a ſatisfaction of any demand
propoſed, that moſt were apt to
believe they were not born wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers.
One day they all addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
themſelves towards a houſe,
which by its largeneſs and ſcitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
promiſed the owner to be a
man of repute, and to them a
plentiful relief; being come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they received but a ſurly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
from a kind of Porter, who
was at the Gate; but poverty
enforcing patience, made them
bear his uncivil language without
retort, and continue for ſome
while in an open Hovel, to repoſe
their weary limbs, and refreſh
their coming ſtomacks with thoſe
Proviſions the charity of ſome
had beſtowed on them; it chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
whileſt they were thus em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed,
that a maid-ſervant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to this Gentlemans houſe,
accidentally came to the Hovel,
and finding theſe poor Travellers
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:65986:30"/>
ſitting on pieces of old Carts and
other lumber, and in ſuch a
ſtrange guiſe, her tender heart
began to take compaſſion at this
unexpected ſight, which made her
courteouſly aſk what they were,
and whether they expected relief
from that Houſe? this emboldned
the heart-broken Paupers, to let
her know their conditions, and
deſire her if ſhe were a Chriſtian,
and had any conſideration of
goodneſs (which was not poſſible,
as <hi>Rodolphus</hi> told her, that one of
her aſpect could want) that ſhe
would do them the kindneſs to let
the Maſter of the houſe know that
ſome poor ſhipwrackt Travellers
were without, and to deſire him to
conſider their condition: this well-diſpoſed
Maid was ſo glad of the
Errand, as if ſhe believed the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
thereof to be meritorious,
and delivered her meſſage with ſo
good a ſucceſs, that orders were
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:65986:31"/>
preſently given to theſe newly-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
Beggars to come to the Hall
door, where (out of curioſity)
ſtood the Miſtreſs of the Houſe,
with ſeveral other Gentlewomen,
expecting their coming; they had
not waited long ere they ſaw our
Travellers, whoſe extremities put
wings to their feet, and made
them advance with a motion
well teſtifying their wants: the
Ladies firſt demands were, from
whence they came, and what they
were, with many other queſtions;
which being anſwered by <hi>Rodol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus,</hi>
they began more curiouſly
to obſerve theſe Wanderers, and
finding ſomething in them more
than in the common ſort of ſuch
Vagabonds, the young Ladies
then began to be more inquiſitive
in knowing their names, birth,
and Country; all which <hi>Rodol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi>
gave them ſo plentiful an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of, and ſo true a one, their
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:65986:31"/>
names only excepted, (for 'twas
pre-agreed among them, to go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the notion and aſſume other
names, by reaſon of their poverty)
that they were not only highly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
in the reality of that free
declare, but the Lady of the
Houſe with a ſtrong paſſion flies
out in the admiration of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
who ſhe verily believed
had brought to her a neer and
deer Relation in the perſon of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolphus;</hi>
ſhe runs to him with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
arms, and embraceth him with
ſuch earneſtneſs, that it hugely
ſurprized the ſtanders by: by
this we may ſee, that if the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
belief of conſanguinity has
power to create ſo great a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
what then muſt be the force
of blood not miſtaken; if <hi>Rodol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi>
found himſelf from a beggar
wrapt in the ſweet embraces of a
worthy Lady, by an abuſed opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
what had been his reception
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:65986:32"/>
or rather his happineſs, if truth
would have allowed a ſympathy
in theſe affections? but as his caſe
then ſtood, he thought it not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
to undeceive this well-minded
Lady, but let her run on
in this kind error, till by her aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
he might do himſelf and
Companions ſome ſervice in their
neceſſities; he therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
her chaſt careſſes, with an
expreſſion as zealous as her own,
and admired his better Fortune
in guiding him to ſo deer a Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman,
as he call'd her. The
name he took on him chanced to
be her maiden name, and his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Father her own Uncle;
he did it not unadviſedly, for he
pickt out a Family which was
gentle and ancient; and ſuch a
Family, that if by accident he
ſhould meet with any that knew
them, he could give as good an
account of them as of his own;
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:65986:32"/>
'tis not convenient to give the
name he then owned, let it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſuffice, that by it he got this
good Kinſwoman, who ſpent no
longer time in an airy congratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
for being ſenſible of their
wants, ſhe preſently commands a
good Fire to be made in the Hall,
and what dry clothes the houſe
afforded, to ſhift their wet and thin
Garments; the aſſiſting hands of
every one of thoſe pretty Ladies
to this charitable work made all
things inſenſibly ready; and when
they ſaw the ſcarcity of mens ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel,
Smocks and Petticoats were
immediately brought in, and ſo
comfortably aired and warmed,
that our drooping and benummed
Travellers found a ſweet refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and alteration by this ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
relief: The next conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency
provided, was good Liquor
and Meat to nouriſh and cheriſh
them within; and that nothing
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:65986:33"/>
might be wanting to the compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of theſe unparallel'd kindneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
the Ladies (as ſoon as they
were ſhifted) came in to them, and
by their preſence made them far
more happy then by all their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
bountiful proviſions. <hi>Rodol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi>
was quite at a ſtand for words
ſuitable for a grateful return; yet
he expreſt himſelf ſo convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that they were all aſſured their
kindneſſes were not beſtowed on
thoſe that wanted thankful ſouls.
Now begins the Lady once more
to be earneſt with her new found
Kinſman, to give her a true and
impartial account of all his Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels
and ſucceſſes, and likewiſe of
his Relations, ſhe being almoſt a
ſtranger among them, by the great
diſtance of place Marriage had
confined her unto. <hi>Rodolphus</hi>
was as free in obeying as ſhe in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring;
ſo that ſhe ſoon underſtood
what ſhe requeſted, and not with
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:65986:33"/>
ſo ſmall a ſatisfaction, but that the
beſt things in this good Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
houſe were all too bad for
the accommodation of her ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrackt
Couſin. <hi>Rodolphus</hi>'s com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
were no loſers by his
good ſucceſs, for whatever he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
was freely diſtributed
among them; he would not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of the leaſt particular aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
which might any wayes
capacitate his condition better
then theirs. Time runs and it
grows late, which made them
think of a farewel that night; ſo
that they all parted to their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
lodgings, where (eſpecially our
weary Travellers) did ſoundly
repoſe their weary Limbs: they
aroſe the next morning with an
intent to go on in their pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage;
they waited ſome hours to
ſee the Ladies, and to give them
an adieu: at laſt they left their
night Quarters, and came among
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:65986:34"/>
their Gueſts, with a new addition
of their yeſterdayes gallantry;
and indeed in ſo noble a garb were
the young Ladies, and in ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
a dreſs, as if they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
to make a conqueſt of Love
as well as Courteſie to their alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Priſoners. <hi>Rodolphus</hi> and the
Captain of the loſt Veſſel, though
in their ordinary Habit, yet were
very pleaſant and merry among
them, and without offence took a
freedom befitting ſuch company.
The Lady of the houſe would
needs have obliged <hi>Rodolphus</hi> in
the acceptance of a very noble
ſuit of clothes, which were lately
made for her Husband, but never
on his back, he being at <hi>London</hi>
when they came home; he could
not out of civility but put them
on, the importunities of the Lady
commanding it; but proving
much too big for him, he gladly
returned them with thanks, for
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:65986:34"/>
he had a real deſire to ſee his
own Relations in the condition
he was then in, believing to
move ſome of them to a ſorrow,
eſpecially thoſe whom he thought
the cauſe of this mechanick Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.
In this time Dinner was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding,
which being brought in,
they broke up other diſcourſes,
and exerciſed themſelves one hour
at leaſt, at that which no leſs than
their lives were concerned in. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolphus</hi>
took this opportunity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
altogether, to declare his own
and Companions thanks for all
their generous obligations, and
then in his own behalf more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
he made his application
to his Kinſwoman, concluding
with an earneſt requeſt that he
might without diſobedience leave
her; for notwithſtanding no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
or company whatever could
be more ſatisfactory or deer to
him than her ſelf and the other
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:65986:35"/>
Ladies, yet the neceſſity of his
parting was ſo extreme, that no
perſwaſion whatever could invite
his l<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nger ſtay; which the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
perceiving, they would not
longer load him with importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
but after mutual and loving
Embraces they parted, our Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers
towards <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
believe the Gentlewoman to
her Cloſet, where with freedom
ſhe might vent her charitable ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
for thus parting with her
poor Kinſman; but ſhe was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſatisfied with the Captains
aſſurance that he gave her at part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which was, that he doubted
not of ſupplies ſufficient to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate
all their neceſſities
when they arrived at <hi>Briſtol;</hi> for
notwithſtanding he was a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
in that City, yet he believed
to meet with a Confident, who
would anſwer his expectations,
were it for hundreds: this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:65986:35"/>
purchaſed the diſcontented
Ladies ſatisfaction, thinking her
Couſin would find a better accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation
by the Captains aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
than by her neglected prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers;
yet this mirror of goodneſs
could not be at quiet after <hi>Rodol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi>
was gone, but ſhe muſt needs
ſend a truſty Meſſenger after them
to obſerve thoſe inconveniencies
ſhe was jealous they would engage
in; and likewiſe gave orders, that
if her Servant perceived they
were diſappointed in their <hi>Briſtol</hi>
expectations, he ſhould immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
proffer to furniſh <hi>Rodolphus</hi>
with forty pounds to be at his
diſpoſe: thus marched our Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers
being fourteen miles from
<hi>Briſtol,</hi> with the Ladies Servant
following them unperceived, and
by their willingneſs they got to
their journeys end that night;
they took up their quarters at a
mean Ale-houſe, places of greater
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:65986:36"/>
repute refuſing the entertainment
of ſuch naked Gueſts; the honeſt
Servant comes to the ſame houſe,
took a room next to theirs, and
diligently obſerved and liſtened
to their diſcourſe, which he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
full of admration and
thanks for his Miſtreſſes civilities,
and likewiſe full of ſorrow and
complaint for their preſent miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
being fruſtrated of all hopes
of ſupplies in that unacquainted
City, by the late death of the
Captains friend: this being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
by the faithful Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
the next morning for our ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful
Travellers Breakfaſts he
gave them the comfortable news
of his Miſtreſſes commands, and
told <hi>Rodolphus,</hi> that if he refuſed
her deſired courteſie, ſhe ſhould
then have great cauſe of unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
for him: this unheard of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity
ſtrangely obliged <hi>Rodol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus,</hi>
and put him almoſt to his
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:65986:36"/>
wits end, whether 'twere beſt or
not to receive this ſum, doubting
his diſability of a punctual pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and ſo made guilty of the
horribleſt unhandſomneſs in the
world, by abuſing the beſt of
women; but now being abſent
from her, and neceſſity ſpeaking
aloud for an acceptance, he
thanked the Meſſenger, and told
him, ſince his Couſins com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
were ſo, he dared not diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
her, eſpecially being utterly
unprovided for any thing neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
towards his long Travels:
this made the Servant go with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition
where he was ordered to
receive the money; he no ſooner
demanded it but had it, and no
ſooner received it, but paid it to
<hi>Rodolphus,</hi> who liberally rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
his honeſty, and with a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
full of acknowledgments ſent
him back to his Miſtreſs; and
out of hand provided himſelf of
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:65986:37"/>
a very handſome ſuit of Clothes,
and ſome good Linnen, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht
the Captain with twenty
pound, who accommodated the
wants of his Seamen, and ſo
they parted, <hi>Rodolphus</hi> to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in <hi>Oxfordſhire,</hi> the Seamen
to their homes at <hi>London.</hi> What
a redemption providence has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
on our lately miſerable
wanderers, let the reader judge;
and if he thinks on't, and not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
it, I am deceived; for from a
wretched and diſtreſſed Beggar,
in a place as uncapable and deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of acquaintance as <hi>Virginia</hi>
it ſelf; from a poor and miſerable
ſlave in the <hi>Indies,</hi> to be thus reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
not only to his former liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and native Country, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
delivered from ſuch a horrid
and dangerous ſhipwrack, and
from a naked and deſpicable po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty
to a gallant and gentile equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page:
I ſay this is not only unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel'd
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:65986:37"/>
but miraculous. <hi>Rodolphus</hi>
is on his march for <hi>Oxfordſhire,</hi>
where he ſoon arrived; but 'twas
in vain to aver his ſufferings, nor
yet his loſſes; none admitting a
belief by reaſon of his then gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
for he made himſelf as fine as
poſſible, and took Sir <hi>Walter Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leighs</hi>
advice as authentick, that
all young men ſhould rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
an equipage above then
below their qualities; he needed
not ſuch a ſpur to prompt him to
that which his own inclinations
alwayes invited him unto, but
more particularly at this time;
for extreams being commonly
the Scenes and Parts of ſuch
Actors, he thought he could not
better quit the opinion of his late
poverty, then by a glorious and
ſplendid ſhew of gallantry, let the
world ſee, that he could become
ſuch a garb as well as his late rags:
His Relations were full of hopes
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:65986:38"/>
and expectations of ſome conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
return from his long voyage:
but they ſoon underſtood his
chiefeſt Riches and Merchandize
to be on his back. About this
time our Queen <hi>Katharine</hi> arrived
at <hi>Portſmoutb,</hi> and an Army was
deſigned for <hi>Portugal,</hi> the Lord
<hi>Inchequeen</hi> being their General.
This deſign was cried up to the
Skies, and extoll'd with ſuch high
Encomiums, that he had not the
ſpirit of a Gentleman, who would
not teſtifie his Loyalty by this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
ſervice. <hi>Rodolphus</hi> had
ſcarce reſted his toſs'd and wearied
Body at his Fathers houſe, but he
muſt once more expoſe himſelf to
the mercy of that rugged Ocean
which lately had been ſo diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
to him; and having a Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that went a Commander in
this expedition, he got the conſent
(by perpetual importunities) of
his Parents, and liſted himſelf in
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:65986:38"/>
a Weſtern Gentlemans Troop,
which then lay at <hi>Plymouth</hi> ready
to take Shipping; and by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of his new Captain, muſtred
a man: Being thus provided with
a couple of able Geldings, and
good Clothes, and Money, he
took Shipping with the reſt of the
Souldiers: and by the favour of a
freſh and moderate Gale they ſoon
arrived at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> where they
found a plauſible reception at
their firſt landing, with Bonfires
and ringing of Bells, and many
other tokens of outward Joy:
ſome of the Officers and a few
young Gentlemen, at their firſt
arrival landed at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
of the Army being tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
farther in the Countrey. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
thoſe that ſtayed behind to
have the advantage of ſeeing that
famous City, was <hi>Rodolphus,</hi> whoſe
curioſity made him earneſt for
that liberty which eaſily was
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:65986:39"/>
granted by his Superiors; they
dreſt themſelves at their firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
into the City, with all the
advantages imaginable, and had
the honour of kiſſing King <hi>Alphon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoes</hi>
hand; who ſeeing ſuch a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
Company, he pleaſantly told
them, that his deſires to his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
were (meaning the King of
<hi>England)</hi> to accommodate him
with Souldiers to fight with the
Spaniard, but he believed he had
ſent him his Courtiers to kiſs his
Country-women. I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
there was never a more gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
party went out of <hi>England</hi>
upon any deſign whatever, than
were that Regiment of Horſe
which <hi>Inchequeen</hi> commanded; of
ſix hundred, there were at leaſt
four hundred of them Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
Sons; they came into the
Country full of money and gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry,
and thoſe which ſurvived
left it as full of poverty and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity:
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:65986:39"/>
But they ſtartled the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guees,</hi>
and made that proud people
confeſs, that few Princes in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom,
but muſt vail their Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net
to <hi>Britains</hi> King. I ſhall not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
upon any thing which is not
directly to <hi>Rodolphus</hi>'s concerns; I
ſhall wave therefore the giving
any account of that Brigado, or
of their ſeveral marches and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
with many eminent ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures
and tranſactions which
hapned among them, and proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
our mark with a diligent
endeavour, not leaving him
an hour without a ſtrict obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of his actions in this relation.
<hi>Rodolphus</hi> was highly taken with
<hi>Lisbon,</hi> he admired the ſcituation
of it, with the noble Harbour
and gallant appearance of ſhiping,
which was conſtantly riding un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their very windows; he liked
extremly the ſeveral orders of the
Religioſes, both men and women,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:65986:40"/>
and was not diſſatisfied with their
contraries the Temporals, whoſe
Faſhions and Cuſtoms, with their
plauſible civilities, made them
much eſteemed by our young
Traveller: his chiefeſt exerciſe
(whileſt he continued at <hi>Lisbon)</hi>
was the hunting of the wild Bore;
which heroick ſport was much
advanced by the Kings preſence,
who ſeldome miſt on <hi>Mondays</hi>
and <hi>Thurſdays</hi> thoſe pleaſant di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions:
his ſtay was not long
there, becauſe of that obligation
all Soldiers are bound unto by an
unavoided reſidence; he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
with two or three more of his
Comrades, makes what haſte he
can after the already march'd Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
but withal took the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of ſeeing thoſe Cities and
other places of greateſt repute,
which lay in or near their way:
this cauſed their journey to be
hugely pleaſant, never wanting
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:65986:40"/>
variety of delightful objects to
ſatisfie their greedieſt curioſities;
ſometimes the religious Hermit,
in his dark and unfrequented Cell,
would invite their going aſtray a
mile or two, the tops of Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
or deſolate Wilderneſſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their uſual places of abode;
their ſevere and rigid life, with a
ſtrange ſequeſtration from the
worlds concerns, was not a little
to be admired; their Diet and
Lodging was as ſtrange, feeding
on nothing but wild Fruits, and
drinking nothing but ſpring-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
wearing nothing but a hairy
Gown (and that next to their
ſkins) nor lying on any thing but
green Turfs and withered leaves:
thus the Hermit: Then their riding
through large and ſpacious Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards,
thronged with ſtately Fig-trees
and Mulberries, with ſeveral
other delicious Fruits, made them
wiſh themſelves perpetual Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:65986:41"/>
in theſe Elizian Fields. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
would they go through brave
and ſumptuous Groves of Olive-Trees,
ſo cloſe and ſhady for many
miles together, that they proved
great friends in ſo near a neighbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
by keeping off the ſcorching
Sun from the melting Paſſenger:
Then would they be extreamly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
in the Orange and Lemon
Groves, which pretty fruit ſeemed
to out-vie one another in their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
by nodding &amp; bowing their
yellow and ſappy heads to the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Traveller to pull and eat his
fill; next would preſent to their
views the Citron and Pomgranet,
who with a more ſurley and ſwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
countenance would tell them,
that notwithſtanding their ſullen
looks, yet their in-ſide exceeded
the reſt of their neighbouring
Kinsfolk both in taſte and colour;
and thoſe that would not believe
might try: Then the prickle Pares
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:65986:41"/>
humility was worth the taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of, ſpreading it ſelf on the
the ground, and ſubject to the
trample of every Aſſe; yet his
goodneſs perhaps not inferior to
thoſe who grow more proudly
and loftier: what ſhould I ſay, but
in few words let you know that
our mother Earth ſeems to be
delighted in nothing more then a
plentiful production of every
thing which may contribute to the
benefit and ſatisfaction of her
commonly ingrate children? the
very mountains, the moſt deſolate
and barbarous places of that Land,
this generous mother clads them in
a noble Mantle, and attires them
in no worſe an equipage then the
beſt of our Engliſh Gardens; for
there is no riding over any of
thoſe places, but of neceſſity their
Horſes Feet muſt tred on, and
bruiſe the tender Herbs and choice
Flowers, which grow ſo abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:65986:42"/>
that 'twould puzzle the beſt
Herbaliſt or Floweriſt to give
their names, and <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>aze them in
their variety: The plenty likewiſe
of Herds of Goats, and other
Cattle was conſiderable, the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
of every Flock being their
proper owners, and attending
them in ſuch a careful, but muſical
manner, that none could ſee them
without a particular obſervation;
they all plaid on the Guittar
and Cittern, and the irrational A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals
prettily kept time to their
muſical Notes: There was no Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger,
but with civility might be
welcome to a draught of Milk,
which the Shepherd liberally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
on any that deſired it, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a little Cork Bucket fitting
for ſuch a purpoſe. Through theſe
delightful Objects paſs our amazed
Travellers, till they came to the
Frontiers of <hi>Portugal;</hi> which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
much more barren to that
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:65986:42"/>
already known Countrey which
their late Travels had acquainted
them with. The contin<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>l Wars
between them and the Spaniard is
the only cauſe of a ſcarcity in
thoſe parts, the Soil and Clime
being as good as in any other place
of the Kingdom; but who knows
not what an enemy War is to Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?
After <hi>Rodolphus</hi>'s firſt arrival
at a conſiderable Frontier-Town
called <hi>Eſtr<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>moſs,</hi> he took up his
Quarters, the reſidue of that
Troop he belonged to being there
diſpoſed of. As he went up the
Streets, it chanced that a Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guez
Nobleman took notice of
him, and immediately fancied
him to reſemble a Brother of his
which died not long before his
coming thither; this Brother be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very much beloved by <hi>Don
Juan de Silva,</hi> who is this Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
cauſed him to give <hi>Rodolphus</hi>
an invitation to his Houſe, and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:65986:43"/>
courteouſly told him, that if he
pleaſed to accept the accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he there found, the beſt which
his houſe afforded, ſhould freely
be at his ſervice: this proved a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility
very rare among thoſe
Countrey Gentlemen, whoſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
exempt them from quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
Souldiers, and whoſe jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie
ſeldom admits of hardly
their relational Acquaintances to
come to their houſes. <hi>Rodolphus</hi>
therefore finding ſuch an earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Invitation, embrac'd it with
thanks, and with his Servant and
Portmanteau, went to <hi>Don Juan</hi>'s;
where they firſt found good Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
for their Horſes, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
as good Proviſion for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:
He found many conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies
(by <hi>Don Juan</hi>'s continued
kindneſſes) which the beſt of his
Countrey-men wanted; for there
his Dyet was incomparably dreſt,
and alwayes ſeaſonable hours ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:65986:43"/>
and a Table ſo plentifully
ſpread, that <hi>Inchequeen</hi> himſelf
would have envied the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of our young Traveller,
could he have imagined his varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
to exceed ſo much his own:
but <hi>Rodolphus</hi> could not be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with the uncivil cuſtom which
they uſe to their Wives and Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
nay to their Mothers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
for they never admit them
to ſit down at Table with them,
nor never ſo much as drink with
them; they keep them at ſo ſtrange
a diſtance, that their Wives muſt
not lie with them but when they
ſend for them, and then not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
an hour or two; a ſtranger
muſt not look on them, nor ſpeak
to them: which made <hi>Rodolphus</hi>
at firſt commit many errors, being
ignorant of their mode: he was
often in <hi>Don Juan's</hi> Houſe ſo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken
with talking and drinking,
and other familiarities among the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:65986:44"/>
Gentlewomen, that had it not
been <hi>Rodolphus,</hi> he had found
a chaſtiſement far exceeding his
crimes, yet anſwerable to the
<hi>Portuguees</hi> jealouſies; but the
great love his noble Patron had
for him, made him take no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of his actions, or at leaſt paſt
them by with a prudent careleſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
yet not ſo unconcerned, but
that <hi>Rodolphus</hi> ſoon found his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake,
and by degrees weaned
himſelf ſo much from his Engliſh
Faſhions, that he became almoſt
a <hi>Portuguez;</hi> which made him en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
with the greater freedom the
advantages that his noble quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
afforded him: he never had a
Napkin twice, nor a Towel two
daies together; he never lay in
Sheets above a week, nor never
wanted the beſt conveniencies
that the curioſity of the better
ſort of that Country enjoyed:
he continued ſix months at leaſt
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:65986:44"/>
at <hi>Don Juans</hi> Houſe, and lived in
ſo great a plenty and gallantry,
that the beſt of the Engliſh Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gade
came far ſhort in their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations,
although they
paid dear for it. But the time of
action draws on, and a ſummons
given for a ſpeedy preparation to
a Campaigne life: the Spaniard
is already in the field, and doing
conſiderable miſchiefs, which
makes the greater haſte for a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Muſter; <hi>Rodolphus</hi> takes
leave of his beloved Landlord,
and tenders with earneſtneſs a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliation
of his kindneſs; he
would willingly have ſatisfied
<hi>Don Juan</hi> for the great charge
himſelf, Servant, and Horſes had
put him unto; but he could fix
nothing on him with all his Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick,
but found a free-Quarters
for that long reſidence; and at
his farewel this noble perſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
ſeveral conveniencies and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:65986:45"/>
proviſions on <hi>Rodolphus,</hi> ſuitable
for a Campaignes want; he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
only of an Engliſh Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier,
and that by perpetual im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities.
But time calls away,
which enforceth <hi>Rodolphus</hi>'s
march, for by this time the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard
had poſſeſt himſelf of one
of the moſt conſiderable Cities in
<hi>Portugal,</hi> called by the name of
<hi>Ebora;</hi> whether the ſucceſs of
that bold atchievement was by the
Spaniſh valour or Portuguez trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery,
I will not now queſtion;
but certain I am, that the loſs of
this City did not only ſurprize,
but likewiſe ſtartle and diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
the whole Army at the news
of it: but <hi>Don Zancho</hi> a Portugal,
and <hi>Conde Chombergh</hi> a French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
being both wiſe and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
men, and Generaliſſimos of
the Portugal Forces, did by their
diſcreet conduct quickly regain
their loſt City, and in a great and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:65986:45"/>
bloudy fight overthrew the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
Army with ſuch a general
rout, that the whole plunder of
the field, with all their bag and
baggage, and thouſands of their
lives paid for their late bold at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt:
the reſolutions and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of the Engliſh Brigade, was
not a little inſtrumental in this
great Victory, although the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grate
<hi>Portugal</hi> would not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
it. I ſhall however wave
their continued and treacherous
baſeneſs which they always ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Engliſh Army, which
deſervedly merited their beſt
eſteem; and only let you know,
that in the fight there were loſt no
leſs than four hundred of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh
Cavalry, the whole number
being but ſix hundred; which
miſerable rack cauſed the poor
Engliſhmen to return with hoarſe
Trumpets &amp; dead-beating Drums,
notwithſtanding a certain and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:65986:46"/>
Victory: <hi>Rodolphus</hi> at that
time was Cornet of Horſe, but
after the fight there were left
more Officers than private Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
the number of that gallant
Regiment being reduced to one
ſmall Troop: this cauſed a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
endeavour by thoſe that
ſurvived, to beſtow themſelves in
other capacities, <gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd liſt among
the Engliſh Infantry; ſome got
commands by vacancies which
the engagement cauſed; among
which by the favour of Colonel
<hi>James Apſly, Rodolphus</hi> got a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
for Captain of Foot, in
which he continued for ſome
months, till the fortune of War
made him Priſoner to the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard;
whoſe noble and heroick ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities
obliged <hi>Rodolphus</hi> ſo much,
that he fully determined at his
releaſement to quit his command,
and never engage himſelf more
againſt a Nation which proved
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:65986:46"/>
ſo far exceeding in all worth and
honour, to thoſe he before haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarded
his life for: he with three
or four more Engliſh-men were
taken by a party of Spaniſh Horſe,
when they leaſt thought on't, and
in the midſt of their recreations,
being merrily flinging Oranges at
one another in a pleaſant Grove
near <hi>Eſtremos,</hi> a Frontier Town
in <hi>Portugal:</hi> Whilſt they were
thus diverting themſelves, the
Spaniards came ratling in amongſt
them, and immediately diſarm
them, and carry them all away
to a City called <hi>Batajos in Caſtile,</hi>
where as Enemies they were ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably
entertained; and during
their confinement, they found all
the curteſies and reſpect that could
be imagined from their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
friends; they had their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to walk where they pleaſed
on their paroll, only a Keeper
with them; and after ſix weeks
impriſonment, by way of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:65986:47"/>
they were reſtored to
their former liberty; and after
their arrival among their former
Aſſociates, <hi>Rodolphus</hi> immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reſign'd his command, and took
ſhipping at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> with a fair and
proſperous Gale, which ſoon
brought them to <hi>Dover,</hi> where
he took Poſt-Horſes for <hi>London;</hi>
but at his arrival there, he found
all his Relations gone, which
made him make what haſte poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to his Fathers in <hi>Oxfordſhire,</hi>
his ſtock being then but very
ſmall. His Friends were a little
ſurprized at his firſt coming home,
his return being ſo ſudden, and
his equipage ſo mean; but they
ſoon conſidered his former adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
to be much after the ſame
manner, and where ever he went
(though never ſo well provided)
yet the beſt account of his profit
was alwayes mean and poor: they
all very well knew, that when he
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:65986:47"/>
left <hi>England,</hi> his accoutrements
for Habit, and Horſes, with money
in his pocket, ſtood his Father in
little leſs then 200 <hi>l.</hi> yet they ſoon
perceived all the clothes on his
back not to be worth two pence,
and all the money in his pocket
not amounting to 6 pence; but
in health and in wealth, in pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and in ſickneſs, <hi>Rodolphus</hi> ſtill
found a moſt loving and indulgent
Father: he now returns like the
true Prodigal, eſpecially in one
ſenſe, having eat and fed on
Acrons in his Portuguez hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips.
After ſome months reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
among his Friends, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
once more to work at the
rough and hard Anvil of the Law,
he keeps the Terms, is call'd to the
Bar, and for a time goes on with
delight; but he now meets with a
rub, which uſually overturns more
ſerious and fixt intents then his
own; he is by Friends adviſed to
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:65986:48"/>
a Miſtreſs, and his own inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
invite him to another; here is
a <hi>Scilly</hi> and <hi>Carybdis,</hi> which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<hi>Rodolphus</hi> can never eſcape
without a miſerable ſhipwrack:
This takes him off from all his new
begun ſtudies; now he begins once
more to laſh out, and deſigns his
courtſhip braveries ſo high, that
he quickly found the inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of ſuch exceſſes; he cares not
for the party whom his Friends re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
him unto, nor ſhe which
his own fancy leads him to, cares
not for him. Thus we ſee poor
<hi>Rodolphus</hi> miſerably toſt in Loves
Blanket: he knows not how to flie
or get out of this new confinment,
but by travelling once more; he
tries that way, and takes the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of ſeeing <hi>Ireland,</hi> where
yet he had never been; he traver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
all parts of that Country, and
hop'd his abſence would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac'd
or at leaſt diminiſhed the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:65986:48"/>
of Relations or his own Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections;
he returns after a twelve-months
travel in that naked, yet
plentiful Country; but finds his
Miſtreſs ſtill continues in his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem,
and his friends ſtill in their
reſolves: He flies obedience to
purſue love, but begins to wiſh he
had fled love to purſue obedience;
he lives in a timerous ſuſpence
for ſome months, till a continued
diſregard from his Admireſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
firſt to cool his amorous flame,
and at laſt clearly quench'd it.
Being free from the very worſt of
captivities, he once more reſolves
to follow his Studies, and in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to his Fathers commands,
he repairs to <hi>London;</hi> where at
his Chamber in the <hi>Inner-Temple</hi>
he continued with an unconcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
induſtry, till going to ſee a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of his at <hi>Hammerſmith,</hi> he
there finds another Devota; his
fancy began to work Chimaeras,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:65986:49"/>
and in the midſt of his moſt ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
thoughts, ſuch idle Ideas
would preſent themſelves before
him, that it hugely diſquietted
his then contentment: he knew
the danger of that malady he
ſo lately to his hurt underwent,
and he was very ſenſible that a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe
was more dangerous than
the firſt infection; he therefore
endeavours to diſengage himſelf
from that growing inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and in time to nip that inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
evil in the bud; his deſires
were not in vain executed; for
he liv'd with a very great indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency,
and his actions and demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
clearly teſtified his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſteem
of any thing but his Book:
he could ſee his <hi>quondam</hi> Miſtreſs
without concern, and could be in
her company without the leaſt
appearance of Loves diſcovery:
this made <hi>Rodolphus</hi> live hugely
c<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ntented at his Siſters Houſe in
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:65986:49"/>
               <hi>Hammerſmith;</hi> till a Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
which the Heavens had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
to be his, came thither; the
firſt ſight of her aſſured him ſhe
was born to be his, and his real
affections to her confirmed him in
the belief of it: he miſſeth no time
in proſecuting his ſuit, nor from
the beginning will never admit of
a denial; his endeavours are with
ſucceſs, for in leſs than two months
he proved to be her Admirer, her
Servant, and her Husband. Now
'tis time to ſing a <hi>Requiem,</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to <hi>Rodolphus</hi>'s Travels and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
ramblings, but to this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe,
which notwithſtanding it
be illiterate and imperfect, yet
the Truth and Reality of it I
hope will find an acceptance from
thoſe who beſtow the peruſal on
